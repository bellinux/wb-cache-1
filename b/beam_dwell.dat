The <b>beam</b> <b>dwell</b> time is set to 1 μs with a spot overlapping of 50 % along both radial (R) and tangential (T) directions. This overlapping corresponds to a pitch of 3.5 nm both in R and T directions while working at 1 pA (∼ 7 nm FWHM beam diameter) and milling disks of 30 – 500 nm in diameter. The patterning strategy is circular scanning where the milling is started at the center and then carried out from the center to the outer circles up to the value of the chosen diameter.|$|E

In order to grow a thin nanoneedle {{on top of a}} conventional AFM probe, the authors move a focused He+ beam during exposure to a PtC precursor gas. In the final growth stage, a perpendicular movement of the beam results in the required three-dimensional (hammerhead) shape. The diameter of the needle depends on the ion beam dose, <b>beam</b> <b>dwell</b> time, and speed of the beam movement. A nanoneedle radius below 10 nm and a hammerhead smaller than 35 nm have been achieved. This fabrication process is robust and enables precise control over the three-dimensions of the hammerhead AFM probe.

50|$|Primary S(T)EM {{electrons}} can {{be focused}} into spots {{as small as}} ~0.045 nm. While the smallest structures deposited so far by EBID are point deposits of ~0.7 nm diameter., deposits usually have a larger lateral size than the beam spot size. The reason are the so-called proximity effects, meaning that secondary, backscattered and forward scattered (if the <b>beam</b> <b>dwells</b> on already deposited material) electrons contribute to the deposition. As these electrons can leave the substrate up to several microns away {{from the point of}} impact of the electron beam (depending on its energy), material deposition is not necessarily confined to the irradiated spot. To overcome this problem, compensation algorithms can be applied, which is typical for electron beam lithography.|$|R

In this paper, we propose a joint beam and dwell time allocation strategy for multi-target tracking in a phased array radar system to achieve multi-target tracking with less system resources. First, we formulate an optimization problem for minimizing the total dwell time on all targets while guaranteeing {{to meet a}} predetermined target-tracking accuracy requirement. The Bayesian Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (BCRLB) is introduced as the tracking performance metric since it provides a lower bound for the error of target state estimate. Second, after proving the optimization problem is nonconvex, we propose a two-step decomposition algorithm which is first to determine the beam pointing and then allocate the <b>beam</b> <b>dwell</b> time to solve it. Finally, we achieve multi-target tracking based on the resource allocation results.

Increasing the number of layers from six to 26 resulted in mound formation, which destroyed the pattern fidelity at close pattern spacings and led to a bimodal quantum dot size distribution as measured by atomic force microscopy. The bimodal size distribution also affected the optical properties of the dots, causing a split quantum dot photoluminescence peak where the separation between the split peaks increased with increasing pattern spacing...|$|E

40|$|Tip Enhanced Near-field Optical Microscopy (TENOM) is {{a method}} for {{optically}} imaging at resolutions far below the diffraction limit. This technique requires optical nano-probes with very specialized geometries, {{in order to obtain}} large, localized enhancements of the electromagnetic field, which is the driver behind this imaging method. Traditional methods for the fabrication of these nano-probes involve electrochemical etching and subsequent FIB milling. However, this milling process is non-trivial, requiring multiple cuts on each probe. This requires multiple rotations of the probe within the FIB system, which may not be possible in all systems, meaning the sample must be removed from vacuum, rotated by hand and placed back under vacuum. This is time consuming and costly and presents a problem with reproducibility. The method presented here is to replace multiple cuts from a side profile with a small number of cuts from a top down profile. This method uses the inherent imaging characteristics of the FIB, by assigning <b>beam</b> <b>dwell</b> times to specific locations on the sample, through the use of bitmap images. These bitmaps are placed over the sample while imaging and provide a lookup table for the beam while milling.

40|$|The sub-nanometer beam of a helium ion {{microscope}} {{was used}} to study and optimize helium-ion beam induced deposition of PtC nanopillars with the (CH 3) 3 Pt(CPCH 3) precursor. The beam current, <b>beam</b> <b>dwell</b> time, precursor refresh time, and beam focus have been independently varied. Continuous beam exposure resulted in narrow but short pillars, while pulsed exposure resulted in thinner and higher ones. Furthermore, at short dwell times the deposition efficiency was very high, especially for a defocused beam. Efficiencies were measured up to 20 times the value for continuous exposure conditions. The interpretation of the experimental data was aided by a Monte Carlo simulation of the deposition. The results indicate that two regimes are operational in ion beam induced deposition (IBID). In the first one, the adsorbed precursor molecules originally present in the beam interaction region decompose. After the original precursor layer is consumed, further depletion is averted and growth continues by the supply of molecules via adsorption and surface diffusion. Depletion around the beam impact site can be distinguished from depletion on the flanges of the growing pillars. The Monte Carlo simulations for low precursor surface coverage reproduce measured growth rates, but predict considerably narrower pillars, especially at short dwell times. Both the experiments and the simulations show that the pillar width rapidly increases with increasing beam diameter.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{considered}} that the advantages emerging from employing chirp pre-compensation in nonlinear microscopy were overweighed by the complexity of prism- or grating-based compressors. These concerns were refuted {{with the advent of}} dispersive-mirrors-based compressors that are compact, user-friendly and sufficiently accurate to support sub- 20 -fs pulse delivery. Recent advances in the design of dispersive multilayer mirrors resulted in improved bandwidth (covering now as much as half of the gain bandwidth of Ti:Sapphire) and increased dispersion per bounce (one reflection off a state-of-the-art dispersive mirror pre-compensates the dispersion corresponding to > 10 mm of glass). The compressor built with these mirrors is sufficiently compact to be integrated in the housing of a sub- 12 -fs Ti:Sapphire oscillator. A complete scanning nonlinear microscope (FemtOgene, JenLab GmbH) equipped with highly-dispersive, large-NA objectives (Zeiss EC Plan-Neofluoar 40 ×/ 1. 3, Pla n-Neofluar 63 ×/ 1, 25 Oil) was directly seeded with this negatively chirped laser.

40|$|While the {{standard}} beam-induced deposition {{approach is to}} grow deposits on a substrate, deposition of self-supporting suspended structures {{can be obtained by}} slowly moving the beam laterally from an elevated edge, in order to grow an overhanging deposit behind the beam path. An example of nanofabrication by lateral-EBID is given in fig. 1, where a suspended nanowire has been deposited across two vertical pillars. The structure is obtained (fig. 1 c) by moving the electron beam from the top of left pillar toward the right one with a scan speed of 33 nm/s, at steps of 5 nm, under a Pt-metallorganic gas flow. As indicated by the lateral dimensions in fig. 1 a and fig. 1 b, an advantage of this deposition method is the high lateral resolution {{because of the lack of}} secondary emissions from the substrate, that enlarge the deposit footprint well above the beam spotsize. The growth mechanism at the basis of lateral deposition, as proposed by Liu and co-workers, is depicted in fig. 2, where a gaussian electron beam, positioned over a thin edge and then moved to the right, is considered. On the first spot, the beam generates a gaussian deposit above (A) and below (B) the edge (because of the deep electron penetration), having a volume and gaussian width which are proportional to the <b>beam</b> <b>dwell</b> time and also depend on the beam shape. When the beam is shifted laterally it falls on a point of the deposit that may be above (O 1 a), at the same level of (O 2), or below (O 3 b) the edge, depending on the amplitude of the shift, and thus give rise to upward (A 1 B 1), parallel (A 2 B 2) or downward (A 3 B 3) growth, respectively. If the lateral shift is much larger than the deposit width, lateral growth doesn’t take place. The process is ruled by the interplay of several parameters, such as the deposition rate, the <b>beam</b> <b>dwell</b> time, the lateral shift amplitude and the beam shape. In most studies, these are often resumed into the beam shift speed which is also a reasonable parameter for a given beam shape and gas flux. A major capability offered by lateral deposition is the three-dimensional (3 D) nanofabrication. Matsui and co-workers demonstrated the potentiality of the technique with several examples of both functional (nanocoils, electrical circuit elements, nanogrippers) and artwork shapes (nanoglass) produced with IBID of carbon precursor. In the case of EBID, Ooi and co-workers presented the fabrication of tools and probes based on suspended nanowires for the manipulation and observation, with SNOM microscopy, of DNA fibers. The structures were realized by lateral-EBID of carbon-contamination gas. Another noteworthy example are the 10 nm-size nanotweezers, with a gap of 25 nm, fabricated at the ends of conventional Si microtweezers by lateral-EBID of C contamination by Boggild et al. Several works were devoted to the study of the growth mechanism and material properties. EBID of 3 D freestanding nanostructures from a Cu precursor was explored by Utke et al [...] Suspended horizontal nanorods were used as a support for the growth of vertical pillars, and it was found that the reduced thermal conductivity with respect to a bulk substrate, resulted in a thermal decomposition of the precursor with higher crystallinity of the Cu deposit. Fujita et al. fabricated 5 nm-width suspended nanowires by lateral-EBID of C contamination with a SEM. They compared the suspended growth with the one of vertical pillars and concluded that the higher resolution in the former was due to the reduced secondary electrons generation within the structure. Liu and co-workers studied the lateral deposition of W precursors with TEM high energy electrons (200 keV), deriving the growth model presented in fig. 2. Lateral EBID has been also investigated on bulk substrates. By varying the lateral scan speed, the inclination of pillars deposited from Au and Mo precursors [] and the periodicity of arch-like structures grown from Cu precursor [] have been studied. The geometry of suspended depositions, grown from a gold precursor in an environmental SEM, has also been explored [].

The grating structures form the basic reflective elements in on-chip integrated waveguide laser devices. Straight sidewalls are desired for minimizing the out-of-plane losses. Both, high depth and straight sidewalls demand for a good control over the re-deposition of material taking place during the milling process. The grating structures were realized by use of a FEI Nova 600 dual beam FIB machine. The acceleration voltage was set to 30 kV. The milling current was varied between 93 pA and 280 pA.

The light induced polymerization depends on light power, wavelength, <b>beam</b> spot size, <b>dwell</b> time, and prior radiation dose of the film. Measurements were made with a custom built scanner that provided accurate control of light power, light polarization, dwell time, and film position {{in relation to the}} beam focus. The results demonstrate that lasers operating with powers of 0. 1, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 mW produce a nonlinear increase in OD of Gafchromic film. The measured change in OD after 1 min of exposure ranges from 0. 150 to 0. 244 for a laser diode operating at 0. 5 and 1. 5 mW, respectively. Tables are included that tabulate the increase in OD for laser power, dwell time, and prior dose. Laser light induced polymerization can {{have a significant impact on}} dosimetry measurements acquired using these laser-based systems. (C) 2000 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} galactic scale Beacons {{from the}} point of view of expense to a builder on Earth. For fixed power density in the far field, what is the cost-optimum interstellar Beacon system? Experience shows an optimum tradeoff, depending on transmission frequency and on antenna size and power. This emerges by minimizing the cost of producing a desired effective isotropic radiated power, which in turn determines the maximum range of detectability of a transmitted signal. We derive general relations for cost-optimal aperture and power. For linear dependence of capital cost on transmitter power and antenna area, minimum capital cost occurs when the cost is equally divided between antenna gain and radiated power. For non-linear power law dependence a similar simple division occurs. This is validated in cost data for many systems; industry uses this cost optimum as a rule-of-thumb. Costs of pulsed cost-efficient transmitters are estimated from these relations using current cost parameters ($/W, $/m 2) as a basis. Galactic-scale Beacons demand effective isotropic radiated power > 1017 W, emitted powers are > 1 GW, with antenna areas > km 2. We show the scaling and give examples of such Beacons. Thrifty beacon systems would be large and costly, have narrow searchlight <b>beams</b> and short <b>dwell</b> times when the Beacon would be seen by an alien oberver at target areas in the sky. They may revisit an area infrequently and will likely transmit at higher microwave frequencies, ~ 10 GHz. The natural corridor to broadcast is along the galactic spiral radius or along the spiral galactic arm we are in. Our second paper argues that nearly all SETI searches to date had little chance of seeing such Beacons. Comment: 40 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|For the fabrication, focused {{ion beam}} {{parameters}} are investigated to successfully fabricate dense periodical patterns, such as gratings, on hard transition metal nitride such as zirconium nitride. Transition metal nitrides such as titanium nitride and zirconium nitride have recently been studied as alternative materials for plasmonic devices because of its plasmonic resonance in the visible and near-infrared ranges, material strength, CMOS compatibility and optical properties resembling gold. Coupling {{of light on the}} surface of these materials using sub-micrometer gratings gives additional capabilities for wider applications. Here we report the fabrication of gratings on the surface of zirconium nitride using gallium ion 30 keV dual beam {{focused ion beam}}. Scanning electron microscope imaging and atomic force microscope profiling is used to characterize the fabricated gratings. Appropriate values for FIB parameters such as ion <b>beam</b> current, magnification, <b>dwell</b> time and milling rate are found for successful milling of dense patterns on zirconium nitride. For the device performance, a real-time image-processing algorithm is developed to enhance the sensitivity of an optical miniature spectrometer. The novel approach in this design is the use of real-time image-processing algorithm to average the image intensity along the arc shaped images registered by the monochromatic inputs on the CMOS image sensor. This approach helps to collect light from the entire arc and thus enhances the sensitivity of the device. The algorithm is developed using SiTiO 2 planar waveguide. The accuracy of the mapping from x-pixel number scale of the CMOS image sensor to the wavelength spectra of the miniature spectrometer is demonstrated by measuring the spectrum of a known LED source using a conventional desktop spectrometer and comparing it with the spectrum measured by the miniature spectrometer. The sensitivity of miniature spectrometer is demonstrated using two methods. In the first method, the input laser power is attenuated to 0. 1 nW and the spectra is measured using the miniature spectrometer. Even at low input power of 0. 1 nW, the spectrum of monochromatic inputs is observed well above the noise level. Second method is by quantitative analysis, which measures the absorption of CdSeS/ZnS quantum dots drop casted between the gratings of Ta 2 O 5 planar single-mode waveguide. The expected guided mode attenuation introduced by monolayer of quantum dots is found to be approximately 11 times above the highest noise level from the absorption measurements. Thus, the miniature spectrometer is capable of detecting the signal from the noise level even with the absorption introduced by monolayer of quantum dots...|$|R
