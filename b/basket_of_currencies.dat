25|$|On 1 October 2016, the RMB {{became the}} first {{emerging}} market currency {{to be included in}} the IMF's special drawing rights basket, the <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> used by the IMF (reserve currency).|$|E
25|$|The special {{drawing rights}} (SDR) {{valuation}} is an IMF <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies,</b> including the Japanese yen. The SDR is linked to a <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> with 41.9% for the U.S. dollar, 37.4% for the euro, 11.3% for the pound sterling, and 9.4% for the yen (as of 2011). The percentage for the yen has, however, declined from 18% in 2000. The exchange rate for the Japanese yen is {{expressed in terms of}} currency units per U.S. dollar; other rates are expressed as U.S. dollars per currency unit. The SDR currency value is calculated daily and the valuation basket is reviewed and adjusted every five years. The SDR was created in 1969, to support the fixed exchange system.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 the US devalued its dollar {{relative}} to gold, leading New Zealand on 23 December to peg its dollar at US$1.216 with a 4.5% fluctuation range, keeping the same gold value.

40|$|We {{examine the}} problem of dynamic reserving for risk in {{multiple}} currencies under a general coherent risk measure. The reserver requires to hedge risk in a time-consistent manner by trading in <b>baskets</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies.</b> We show that reserving portfolios in multiple currencies V are time-consistent when (and only when) a generalisation of Delbaen's m-stability condition D 06, termed optional -m-stability, holds. We prove {{a version of the}} Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing in this context. We show that this problem is equivalent to dynamic trading across <b>baskets</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> (rather than just pairwise trades) in a market with proportional transaction costs and with a frictionless final period.

40|$|In July 2005 the Chinese {{government}} announced a {{switch to a}} new exchange rate regime. The new exchange rate regime is set with reference to a <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> <b>currency.</b> But the numerical weights <b>of</b> each <b>currency</b> in the basket are unannounced. Under economic and political pressures, China adjusted his exchange rate regime, which {{is no longer a}} peg to the US dollar. Subsequently, with the appreciation of the Chinese Yuan, China allowed a movement of the exchange rate up to 3 % within any given day. Perhaps, the new exchange rate policy has an impact on the imports and exports, even other countries' exchange rate policy, the international imbalance and financial market. We argue that China is not really conducting the <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> policy after the reform. The Chinese government released the composition <b>of</b> <b>basket</b> <b>currencies</b> and the determinant <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> weights. But the exact weights are still unknown. The methodology and results of this paper are easily summarized. First of all, we use the technique introduced by Frankel and Wei (1994) to estimate the currency weights. We find that the Euro and Japanese Yen are insignificant in the <b>basket</b> in terms <b>of</b> numeraire <b>currency,</b> the Swiss Franc and Special Drawing Rights. The results from Ordinary Linear Square show that China's exchange rate regime remains a peg to the US dollar tightly, because the weight of the US dollar is in exceed of 0. 9. Then, following the regression results, we do F-test, rolling and recursive regression for the basket currencies. Moreover, we use Kalman Filter and Smooth method to test the significance of coefficient <b>of</b> each <b>currency.</b> We find that there is a slight decline of the coefficient, but it has no economic influence. Furthermore, we use Structural Break and Outlier method to test the significance of the coefficient <b>of</b> the <b>currencies.</b> The results show that the US dollar peg is still strong. That's to say, although China is conducting the new exchange rate regime gradually, the exchange rate policy is not a perfect peg to a <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> <b>currency...</b>|$|R

25|$|In September 1974, Australia {{moved to}} a peg against a <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> called the trade {{weighted}} index (TWI) {{in an effort to}} reduce fluctuations associated with its peg to the US dollar.

25|$|The renminbi {{is held in}} a {{floating}} exchange-rate system managed primarily against the US dollar. On 21 July 2005, China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and, since then has moved to an exchange rate system that references a <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> and has allowed the renminbi to fluctuate at a daily rate of up to half a percent.|$|E
25|$|With the {{breakdown}} of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, Australia converted the traditional peg to a fluctuating rate against the US dollar.

25|$|The new Government {{was faced}} with an {{exchange}} rate crisis the day after it was elected. Speculators expected the change of government {{to result in a}} 20% devaluation of the New Zealand dollar, which led to the 1984 New Zealand constitutional crisis due to Muldoon's refusal to devalue, worsening the currency crisis further. As a result, the dollar was floated on 4 March 1985, allowing for {{the value of the dollar}} to change with the market. Prior to the dollar being floated, the dollar was pegged against a <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1991, India {{still had}} a fixed {{exchange}} system, where the rupee was pegged {{to the value of}} a <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> of major trading partners. India started having balance of payments problems since 1985, {{and by the end of}} 1990, it found itself in serious economic trouble. The government was close to default and its foreign exchange reserves had dried up to the point that India could barely finance three weeks’ worth of imports. As in 1966, India faced high inflation and large government budget deficits. This led the government to devalue the rupee.|$|E

25|$|Finland {{joined the}} Bretton Woods Agreement in 1948. The value of markka was pegged {{to the dollar}} at 320 mk/US$, which became 3.20 new mk/US$ in 1963 and devalued to 4.20 mk/US$ in 1967. After the {{breakdown}} of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1971, a <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> became the new reference. Inflation was high (over 5%) during 1971–85. Occasionally, devaluation was used, 60% in total between 1975 and 1990, allowing the currency to more closely follow the depreciating US dollar than the rising German mark. The paper industry, which mainly traded in US dollars, was often blamed for demanding these devaluations to boost their exports. Various economic controls were removed and the market was gradually liberalized throughout the 1980s and the 1990s.|$|E

The government was close to default, its central bank had refused new credit and foreign exchange reserves had reduced to the point that India could barely finance three weeks’ worth of imports. It had to pledge 20 tonnes of gold to Union Bank of Switzerland and 47 tonnes to Bank of England as part of a bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

50|$|The WCU was {{proposed}} by Lok Sang Ho of Lingnan University, Hong Kong. The WCU was first {{intended to be}} the basis for denominating global bonds, a debt instrument that is issued globally and is subscribable by people and institutions around the world. Simply put, it is a GDP-weighted <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> key <b>currencies</b> each <b>of</b> which is indexed against inflation for the relevant countries. The WCU is defined with respect to a base year, so that each unit represents the same global purchasing power as at that base year. The unindexed basket, called the benchmark <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> key <b>currencies,</b> is the basis for the derivation of effective exchange rate indices that has been demonstrated to be both easy to compile and superior to most official effective exchange rate indices.|$|R

In September 2009 China, India and Russia said {{they were interested in}} buying International Monetary Fund gold to diversify their dollar-denominated securities. However, in July 2010 China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange [...] "ruled out the option of dumping its vast holdings of US Treasury securities" [...] and said gold [...] "cannot become a main channel for investing our foreign exchange reserves" [...] because the market for gold is too small and prices are too volatile.|$|E
2500|$|With {{a second}} [...] "Schilling" [...] law on November 21, 1947, new {{banknotes}} were introduced.

The currency stabilised in the 1950s, with the Schilling being tied to the U.S. dollar at a rate of $1 = 26 Schilling. Following the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, the Schilling was initially tied to a <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> and then, in July 1976, the Schilling was coupled to the German mark.|$|E
