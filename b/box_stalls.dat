25|$|The {{middle bay}} {{was used for}} {{unloading}} hay wagons, threshing (thrashing) grain and other work. The foundation was typically not quarried stone but fieldstone and had no basement thus are called a ground barn. The timbers used were typically one solid piece running {{the full length of}} the building sometimes over forty feet long. The cows often stood on the ground rather than on a wood floor, their heads facing the middle bay in what is called a tie-up (not individual <b>box</b> <b>stalls).</b> Also the breeds of cows were usually smaller than today. English barns were built before the New England practice of connecting the barn to the house was popular so these barns are usually separate from the house although they could have been connected to the house at a later date. Houses and barns in New England built before the early 19th century typically face south rather than facing a road, the later orientation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} dimensions for a box stall (called a [...] "box" [...] in the UK, and a [...] "stall" [...] in the USA) {{vary from}} 10' by 12' to 14' by 14', depending on local cultural traditions, the breed of horse, gender, and any special needs. Mares with foals often {{are kept in}} double stalls. Stallions, kept alone with less access to turnout, are also often given larger quarters. [...] Ponies sometimes are kept in smaller <b>box</b> <b>stalls,</b> and warmbloods or draft horses may need larger ones. [...] Horses kept in stables need daily exercise and may develop stable vices {{if they are not}} given work or turnout. [...] <b>Box</b> <b>stalls</b> usually contain a layer of absorbent bedding such as straw or wood shavings and need to be cleaned daily; a horse generates approximately [...] of manure and several gallons of urine each day. [...] There are health risks to the horse if forced to stand all day in its own waste.|$|E

40|$|September 29, 1948, a 2 - year-old Stanradrbred {{stallion}} {{was admitted}} to Stange Memorial Clinic for treatment of an injury of the penis which had occurred the night before. The history, as offered by the owner and the groom, indicated the stallion had escaped from his <b>box</b> <b>stall</b> into a runway in the barn. A Shetland pony was kept in a <b>box</b> <b>stall</b> near that of the stallion. The groom stated that the pony had remained within the stall throughout the night and therefore could not have caused the injury.

2500|$|Horses are {{sometimes}} kept indoors in buildings called either barns or stables. The terms {{are often used}} interchangeably; a barn is the more general term for a rural building that houses livestock, the term stable is more often used in urban areas {{and can be used}} as a noun to refer to the building that houses horses or the collection of horses themselves, or as a verb to describe the act of keeping horses in a stable. [...] These buildings are usually unheated and well-ventilated; horses may develop respiratory problems when kept in damp or stuffy conditions. [...] Most horse barns have a number of <b>box</b> <b>stalls</b> inside, that allow many horses to be safely stabled together in separate quarters. [...] There are also separate areas or even rooms for feed, equipment and tack storage and, in some large stables, there may be additional facilities such as a veterinary treatment area or a washing area in the building. [...] Barns may be designed to hold one horse in the backyard of a family home, or be a commercial operation capable of holding dozens of animals.|$|E
2500|$|Mares due to foal {{are usually}} {{separated}} from other horses, {{both for the}} benefit of the mare and the safety of the soon-to-be-delivered foal. [...] In addition, separation allows the mare to be monitored more closely by humans for any problems that may occur while giving birth. [...] In the northern hemisphere a special foaling stall that is large and clutter free is frequently used, particularly by major breeding farms. [...] Originally, this was due in part to a need for protection from the harsh winter climate present when mares foal early in the year, but even in moderate climates, such as Florida, foaling stalls are still common because they allow closer monitoring of mares. [...] Smaller breeders often use a small pen with a large shed for foaling, or they may remove a wall between two <b>box</b> <b>stalls</b> in a small barn to make a large stall. [...] In the milder climates seen in much of the southern hemisphere, most mares foal outside, often in a paddock built specifically for foaling, especially on the larger stud farms. Many stud farms worldwide employ technology to alert human managers when the mare is about to foal, including webcams, closed-circuit television, or assorted types of devices that alert a handler via a remote alarm when a mare lies down in a position to foal.|$|E

5000|$|By 1870, Taylor {{had seen}} the {{construction}} of Manton Stables near Marlborough in Wiltshire, with the financial backing of Stirling Crawfurd, a property developer in Glasgow and coal mine owner {{one of the owners}} of the horses that Taylor now trained.

5000|$|The {{horse is}} usually locked in stables, in a <b>box</b> or a <b>stall,</b> {{when not in}} use by humans. The size of the box is reduced (3 to 4 metres per side and 2.5 metres high), while the stall is even smaller. The horse has very little room to move. This {{confining}} stable, often reinforced with grills, also deprives it of contact with its peers. Its food is often thrown on the floor, where it is sometimes forced to urinate and defecate. According to the definition of equine welfare advocated by INRA and the Farm Animal Welfare Council, because life in a <b>box</b> or <b>stall</b> prevents the horse from expressing its normal behaviour, it constitutes a form of abuse. Other specialists like Pierre Enoff (who compares the boxed horse to a goldfish in a glass of water) and Laetitia Bataille (who compares the term [...] "equine detention" [...] to prison vocabulary) also believe that the box format causes suffering. The damages caused by this prolonged life in a <b>box</b> or <b>stall</b> are at the root of stable vices. These behavioural problems of domestic horses often come from isolation and lack of exercise. Their expression can be varied. The Institut français du cheval et de l'équitation advises never leaving a horse alone, either in the paddock or in the stable. In the case where a horse is placed in a <b>box</b> or <b>stall,</b> Swiss law requires that the horse is allowed out for at least two hours each day. After all, these living conditions create aggression: the further removed from conditions in the wild, the more relationship problems among horses increase.|$|R
