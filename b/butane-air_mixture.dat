40|$|Vanadium {{phosphorous}} oxide (VPO) {{is traditionally}} manufactured from solid vanadium oxides by synthesizing VOHPO 4 &# 8729; 0. 5 H 2 O (the precursor) followed by in situ activation to produce (VO) 2 P 2 O 7 (the active phase). This paper discusses an alternative synthesis method based on sol-gel techniques. Vanadium (V) triisopropoxide oxide was reacted with ortho-phosphoric acid in an aprotic solvent. The products were dried at high pressure in an autoclave with a controlled excess of solvent. This procedure produced a gel of VOPO 4 with interlayer entrapped molecules. The {{surface area of}} the obtained materials was between 50 and 120 m 2 /g. Alcohol produced by the alkoxide hydrolysis reduced the vanadium during the drying step, thus VOPO 4 was converted to the precursor. This procedure yielded non-agglomerated platelets, which were dehydrated and evaluated in a <b>butane-air</b> <b>mixture.</b> Catalysts were significantly more selective than the traditionally prepared materials with similar intrinsic activity. It is suggested that the small crystallite size obtained increased their selectivity towards maleic anhydride...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{numerical model}} is generated {{to investigate the}} micro-scale combustion and the extinction limits in such combustors. The Swiss roll type of spiral counter current heat recirculation combustor is modeled by unwrapping {{for the sake of}} simplicity. The diffusion of heat among the walls is simulated by using heat fluxes and transporting them throughout the geometry. The effects of Reynolds number, equivalence ratio on the temperature distribution and chemical reaction rate are investigated. Also, the extinction limits of propane-air, methane-air, ethane-air and <b>butane-air</b> <b>mixtures</b> are calculated...|$|R
40|$|Flame {{ignition}} by short-duration (â‰ˆ 50 ns) transient plasma, or corona, discharges {{was investigated}} for methane-air, propane-air and <b>butane-air</b> <b>mixtures</b> at atmospheric and elevated pressures. Such discharges produce a larger fraction of high-energy electrons, yield more spatially distributed energy and deposit {{energy in the}} gas more efficiently than conventional arc discharges do. We show that compared to conventional arc ignition, flames ignited by transient discharges yield significantly shorter (typically {{by a factor of}} 3) ignition delay and burn times. The major advantage of coronas was found to be the spatial distribution of ignition sites and more efficient use of wall-plug energy. Experimental evidence suggests that chemical effects of the ionized species and radicals generated are apparently minor. The observed effects of discharge energy, equivalence ratio, pressure and fuel type on ignition delay and burn times can all be explained using a simple mechanistic model that considers the spatial distribution of streamers and a hypothesized minimum streamer ignition energy that is analogous to the conventional minimum ignition energy. Applications to practical combustion devices such a...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the possibility of}} a novel propagation mechanism of vapour cloud explosions. The hypothesis is based on the potential of forward thermal radiation from hot combustion products to initiate combustion ahead of the main flame front by igniting particles suspended in the unburnt gas mixture. The formation of such local ignition events may cause an augmented explosion. An experimental investigation is described in which a laser source is used to heat various types of particles in flammable <b>butane-air</b> <b>mixtures.</b> It is found that fine powders can ignite an adjacent charge upon irradiation. Ignition times are established for a range of particles with widely different characteristics (size, type, morphology, etc.). In particular, ignition times scales 100 ms could be obtained at an irradiance of 600 kW/m^ 2 using glass substrates coated with a carbon black. The relationship between absorption-emission properties of different powders is investigated further by determining particle temperatures under relevant radiation levels using time-resolved emission spectroscopy. Two different ignition regimes were observed, ignition temperatures appeared to be constant for non-reactive silicon carbide, while for reactive powders, temperature appeared to be not the sole ignition criterion. In response to the lack of radiation measurements for large scale premixed systems, a tool is developed for estimating the radiation flux emitted from such systems along with the corresponding level of irradiance posed on particles raised in the unburnt gas mixture. This information permits an assessment of the potential role of forward thermal radiation on the flame propagation. The comparison of such theoretical estimates with the experimentally measured ignition time data is vital for evaluation purposes. The analysis shows that the estimated and required fluxes are comparatively close and, hence, the proposed flame propagation mechanism is credible. Open Acces...|$|R
