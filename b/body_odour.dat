The reproductive success of men largely depends on mating with fertile women, but it is not known whether men can detect a woman's fertile period. We asked women who had regular menstrual cycles and who were not using hormonal contraceptives to wear a T-shirt for three consecutive nights during their late follicular (ovulatory) phase and another T-shirt during the luteal (non-ovulatory) phase of their menstrual cycle. Male raters judged the odours of T-shirts worn during the follicular phase as more pleasant and sexy than odours from T-shirts worn during the luteal phase. The odour differences between the follicular and luteal phases did not dissipate quickly over time as male raters were able to detect and judge follicular phase <b>body</b> <b>odours</b> as more pleasant and sexy than the odours from the luteal phase even after the T-shirts were kept at room temperature for one week.

50|$|Whilst a {{vast number}} of studies have been {{conducted}} to investigate <b>body</b> <b>odour</b> and mating, research is now shifting in particular towards the effect of male scent to female sexual attraction. This is largely due to the effects of the menstrual cycle and hormone contraceptives, which directly affect women’s partner preference. Past research has highlighted the importance of a male’s scent to females, such that smell was rated significantly more important for women than men. Furthermore, smell and <b>body</b> <b>odour</b> were rated as the most important physical factor for females, compared to looks for men. Further studies have aimed to understand these sex differences. Using questionnaires and self-report data, a greater reliance was found for females on olfactory cues than males. Interestingly this reliance was valued for females in both sexual and non-sexual contexts. The research strongly supports the hypothesis that whilst men utilise more physical and visual cues, women rely more heavily on olfactory cues such as <b>body</b> <b>odour</b> that men tend to overlook.|$|E

Past research has shown that videos of men using fragranced antiperspirants were rated as more attractive by women than those in a placebo control condition.

This provides evidence that females are more attentive on olfactory cues during partner selection. Aside from artificial fragrances, researchers have also become focused on more natural odour enhancements such as diet quality. A recent study aimed to investigate whether a dietary fruit and vegetable intake would influence female mate preferences.

40|$|Host-seeking is an {{important}} component of mosquito vectorial capacity on which the success of the other behavioural determinants depends. Blood-seeking mosquitoes are mainly guided by chemical cues released by their blood hosts. This thesis describes results of a study that determined the effect of microorganisms – host skin bacteria as well as malaria parasites – on host-seeking behaviour of female Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto and An. arabiensis in Homabay county, western Kenya. Semi-field and field experiments were conducted to determine the response of mosquitoes with different host preference to synthetic and natural odour blends from three vertebrate hosts, a human, a cow and a chicken. Screen house experiments were conducted to test whether specific skin bacteria or a mix of skin bacterial volatiles from the three vertebrate hosts mediate mosquito response. A review chapter in this thesis discusses how malaria parasites can manipulate human hosts to enhance their own transmission, by making the hosts more attractive to mosquitoes. Another experiment, using a dual-choice olfactometer, determined whether infection with malaria parasites increases human attractiveness to malaria mosquitoes, and whether the attractiveness of infected humans is Plasmodium falciparum-stage specific. Here, the same children participated in the study during infection with malaria parasites and after treatment with antimalarial drugs, artemisinin lumefantrine. Cage assays were further used to test mechanisms of attractiveness of P. falciparum-infected individuals using <b>body</b> <b>odours</b> or skin bacterial volatiles collected from the children at the two time points. Overall results show that skin bacterial volatiles play {{an important}} role in guiding mosquitoes with different host preferences to their specific host. For An. gambiae s. s., high (microscopic) densities of P. falciparum gametocytes (and not parasite-free, submicroscopic gametocytes or asexual stages of Plasmodium parasites) results into higher attractiveness of hosts, and <b>body</b> <b>odours</b> play a role in attractiveness of P. falciparum-infected humans. The results may help to develop more effective health policies and enable targeted interventions towards the most attractive hosts, which could contribute to reductions in malaria transmission. Identification of general or common attractive volatiles produced by the natural hosts as well as those from the gametocyte carriers may contribute to the development of an improved synthetic odour blend that may be used for sampling of mosquitoes with different host preferences. The use of powerful attractive odorants may result in reductions of vector-borne diseases transmitted by mosquitoes...|$|R
50|$|During their fertile phase, {{females have}} {{repeatedly}} been shown {{as being more}} attracted to the <b>body</b> <b>odours</b> of more symmetrical males and of males whose faces they rate as attractive. The scent of symmetrical males provides an honest indicator of the male's phenotypic and genetic quality. This may explain why women who are highly fertile find the scent of low FA as attractive and yet this scent is not necessarily as attractive to other women. For example, {{it has been found}} that normal cycling women near their peak fertility tended to prefer the odour of shirts worn by symmetrical men and yet women at low fertility in their menstrual cycle or those using the contraceptive pill showed no preference for the odour of shirts of symmetrical men compared to those of asymmetrical men. These findings support the good genes hypothesis such that when women are in the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle, they should prefer markers of genetic benefits or 'good genes'. In other words, fertile women who prefer the scent of men with low FA are demonstrating a preference for the genetic benefits associated with those symmetric men.|$|R
40|$|In many species, older {{males are}} often {{preferred}} mates because they carry 'good' genes {{that account for}} their viability. How females discern a male's age {{is a matter of}} question.

To investigate whether there are changes in <b>body</b> <b>odours</b> with age, and if so their composition, mice were trained in a Y-maze to discriminate urine odours of donor mice of different ages: Adult (3 - 10 months old) and Aged (more than 17 months old). Trained mice could discriminate between these two age groups by odour alone. To determine the chemical basis for these discriminations, studies were performed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. These analyses demonstrated differences in the ratio of urinary volatiles with age. The most prominent differences involved significantly greater amounts of 2 -phenylacetamide and significantly lower amounts of methylbutyric acids in Aged animals relative to Adult animals. Fractionating and manipulating the levels of these compounds in the urine demonstrated that the mice can distinguish age based on variation in amounts of these specific compounds in the combined urine...|$|R

Primary trimethylaminuria sufferers have an inherited enzyme deficiency where TMA is not efficiently converted to the non-odorous TMAO in the liver. Secondary causes of trimethylaminuria have been described, sometimes accompanied by genetic variations. Diagnosis of trimethylaminuria requires the measurement of TMA and TMAO in urine, which should be collected after a high substrate meal in milder or intermittent cases, most simply, a marine-fish meal.
