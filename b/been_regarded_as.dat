5|$|Broadcast {{during a}} strike that took ITV (the BBC's rival) off the air, City of Death scored high ratings. The fourth episode was watched by over sixteen million viewers, the highest UK {{television}} audience ever attained by {{an episode of}} Doctor Who. Although, in retrospect, it has <b>been</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the best}} serials from Doctor Who classic run, the initial reception was not as positive, with criticism of the humorous tone.|$|E

5|$|In a {{combined}} offensive against Blanco strongholds, the Brazilian–Colorado troops advanced through Uruguayan territory, taking one town after another. Eventually the Blancos were left isolated in Montevideo, the national capital. Faced with certain defeat, the Blanco government capitulated on 20 February 1865. The short-lived war would have <b>been</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> an outstanding success for Brazilian and Argentine interests, had Paraguayan intervention {{in support of}} the Blancos (with attacks upon Brazilian and Argentine provinces) not led to the long and costly Paraguayan War.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus, who {{classified}} most {{kinds of}} sessile animals {{as belonging to}} the order Zoophyta in the class Vermes, mistakenly identified the genus Spongia as plants in the order Algae. For a long time thereafter sponges were assigned to a separate subkingdom, Parazoa ("beside the animals"), separate from the Eumetazoa which formed {{the rest of the}} kingdom Animalia. They have <b>been</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a paraphyletic phylum, from which the higher animals have evolved. Other research indicates Porifera is monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|Quarry House was {{constructed}} {{on the site}} of the former Quarry Hill Flats (see 1920s and 1930s) at Quarry Hill. The building houses the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions and is their main regional offices. The building is controversial. Its imposing design has often <b>been</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> being domineering and self-important and has led the building to be nicknamed The Kremlin and The Ministry of Truth.|$|E

5|$|The Ama are Japanese skin divers, {{predominantly}} women, who traditionally {{dive for}} shellfish and seaweed {{wearing only a}} loincloth and {{who have been in}} action for at least 2,000 years. Starting in the twentieth century, they have increasingly <b>been</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a tourist attraction. They operate off reefs near the shore, and some perform for sightseers instead of diving to collect a harvest. They have been romanticized as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|The Mana series {{reception}} {{has been}} very uneven, with early games rated higher by critics than more recent titles. Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 have <b>been</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> {{some of the best}} 2D action role-playing games ever made, and their music has inspired several orchestral concerts, while the games from the World of Mana series have been rated considerably lower. As of March 2011, Mana series titles have sold over 6 million units.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} meaning of Ely's name have always <b>been</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> obscure by place-name scholars, and are still disputed. The {{earliest}} record of the name is in the Latin text of Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, where Bede wrote Elge. This is apparently not a Latin name, and subsequent Latin texts nearly all used the forms Elia, Eli, or Heli with inorganic H-. In Old English charters, and in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the spelling is usually Elig.|$|E

50|$|The {{assembly}} {{and the courts}} <b>were</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> the instantiation {{of the people of}} Athens: they were the people, no power was above them and they could not be reviewed, impeached or punished.

As such, he could <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> failing in his duty and be punished for it.|$|R
5|$|Walton {{worked for}} many years on his only {{full-length}} opera, Troilus and Cressida, both before its premiere and afterwards. It has never <b>been</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a success. The libretto is generally considered weak, and Walton's music, despite many passages that have won critical praise, is not dramatic enough to sustain interest. Grove calls the work a partially successful attempt to revivify the traditions of nineteenth-century Italian opera in a post-war era wary of heroic Romanticism.|$|E
5|$|After its {{dedication}} in 972, {{and with}} the hiring by mosque authorities of 35 scholars in 989, the mosque slowly developed into what is today the second oldest continuously run university in the world after Al Karaouine in Umayyad Fes. Al-Azhar University has long <b>been</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> the foremost institution in the Islamic world {{for the study of}} Sunni theology and sharia, or Islamic law. The university, integrated within the mosque as part of a mosque school since its inception, was nationalized and officially designated an independent university in 1961, following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} time of his union with Cacht, Donnchad aspired to become High King of Ireland. With {{powerful}} maritime forces at his command, Echmarcach would have certainly <b>been</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> an important potential ally. Clear evidence of an alliance between Echmarcach and the Uí Briain is preserved by the twelfth-century Banshenchas, a text which records the marriage of Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, to Tadc (died 1086), son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain (died 1086). Annalistic evidence of such an alliance is found well into the late eleventh century. In fact, kinship between Echmarcach's descendants and the Uí Briain even led to the accession of one of Echmarcach's maternal grandsons, Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115), to the kingship of the Isles at about the turn of the twelfth century.|$|E
50|$|Ethical value may <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a study under ethics, which, in turn, may {{be grouped}} as philosophy. Similar to that ethics may <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a {{subfield}} of philosophy, ethical value may <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a subgroup of the more broad (and vague) philosophic value. Ethical value denotes something's degree of importance, {{with the aim of}} determining what action or life is best to do, or at least attempt to describe the value of different actions. It may be described as treating actions themselves as abstract objects, putting value to them. It deals with right conduct and good life, in the sense that a highly, or at least relatively highly, valuable action or may <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> good, and an action of low, or at least relatively low, value may <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> bad.|$|R

5|$|Because Sitta przewalskii {{has long}} <b>been</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a {{subspecies}} of the white-cheeked nuthatch, its description {{has often been}} made in comparison with it. Though both species lack the black eyestripe typical of other nuthatches, their coloring is distinct, with S. leucopsis being white- or creamy-buff on its throat, cheeks, breast, flanks and belly, where S. przewalskii has varying shades and concentrations of cinnamon. S. przewalskii is also the smaller of the two, and its bill is markedly thinner. Males and females of the species are nearly identical in appearance, except for the male's brighter cinnamon coloring.|$|E
5|$|Containing autobiographical themes, a {{majority}} of the album's lyrics came {{as the result of a}} series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also <b>been</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women.|$|E
5|$|Gomphus clavatus is edible; it {{is rated}} as choice by some, while others find it tasteless. It has an earthy flavor and meaty texture that has <b>been</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> suiting red meat dishes. Like many edible fungi, {{consumption}} may cause gastrointestinal distress in susceptible individuals. The flesh becomes bitter with age, and older specimens may be infested with insects. Insect infestation is unlikely {{if the weather}} is cool. G.clavatus has been used for cooking for some time—Fries included it in his 1867 book Sveriges ätliga och giftiga svampar (Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms in Sweden). It is highly regarded by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca, Mexico, and the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal.|$|E
