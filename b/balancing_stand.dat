40|$|Alfonso Castillo-Rodríguez, 1 José Luis Chinchilla-Minguet 2 1 Faculty of Sport, University of Pablo de Olavide, Seville, 2 Department of Didactics of Musical, Plastic, and Corporal Expression, University of Malaga, Malaga, Spain Background: In Spain, {{more than}} 50 % of 60 -year-olds are obese. Obesity {{is a disease}} with serious {{cardiovascular}} risks. The mortality rate for cardiovascular disease in Spain is 31. 1 %. Objectives: To improve aerobic fitness, strength, flexibility and balance, and body composition (BC) in persons over 60  years old. Materials and methods: A clinical intervention study of 24  participants was carried out {{over a period of}} 3  months. Aerobic fitness was assessed using the Rockport 1 -Mile Walk Test. Upper-body strength was evaluated with an ad hoc test. Flexibility and balance were evaluated using the Sit and Reach Test and the Stork <b>Balance</b> <b>Stand</b> Test, respectively. Anthropometric measurements were taken by bioelectrical impedance. Results: After 3  months of training, aerobic fitness was improved, as demonstrated by improved test times (pretest 13. 04  minutes, posttest 12. 13  minutes; P< 0. 05). Body composition was also improved, but the results were not statistically significant (fat mass pretest 31. 58 %± 5. 65 %, posttest 30. 65 %± 6. 31 %; skeletal muscle mass pretest 43. 99 ± 9. 53  kg, posttest 46. 63 ± 10. 90  kg). Conclusion: Our data show that in subjects over 60  years old, aerobic fitness was improved due to program intervention. However, these results should be treated with caution, because of the limited sample size and the brief time period of this pilot study. A more rigorous study would include a sample of at least 100  participants.

From the point of view here expressed, the hypermetabolism in ALS should be evaluated as a magnifying glass through which looking at the ALS pathogenesis is from a different perspective in which defective metabolism can disclose novel mechanistic interpretations and lines of intervention...|$|R

The samples were 18 children with down syndrome which got <b>balance</b> disorder in <b>stand.</b> The study spent two months. There were two groups.

The Measuring instrument used  sixteen balance test which was included pre (0 -session) and post (6 -session) test for each subject. The descriptive data for both of groups are age: 2 - 4 years old children with down syndrome, sex: male and female, height: 70 - 85 cm and weight: 8 - 13 kg. The pre-test data of group one does not show normal distribution, but the post-test data shows normal distribution. Both of  pre-test and post-test data of  group two show normal distribution. According to compatibility test to both of groups, the hypothesis test used post-test data.

At the end of 1988 the VAG trust fund held reserves sufficient to pay unemployment benefits at the 1976 rate, that is 1. 8 % of gross payrolls, {{for nearly two years}} (1. 9 years).

For the following reasons it is appropriate to apply this rule to the VAG fund. First, the rule is stated in relative terms specific to the experience of the fund.

The number of dicot herbs increased from five, mainly two Sida species, to 13 species, monocots were represented by one species only (Aristida sp.), and quantity of herb forage reached 3 ton/ha (2 : 1, dicot:monocot). Adjacent overgrazed plots kept the initial low level of herb cover and species composition.
