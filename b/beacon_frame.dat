50|$|According to the 802.11 standards, a Delivery Traffic Indication Map (DTIM) period {{value is}} a number that determines how often a <b>beacon</b> <b>frame</b> {{includes}} a Delivery Traffic Indication Message, and this number is included in each <b>beacon</b> <b>frame.</b> A DTIM is included in beacon frames, according to the DTIM period, to indicate to the client devices whether the access point has buffered broadcast and/or multicast data waiting for them. Following a <b>beacon</b> <b>frame</b> that includes a DTIM, the access point will release the buffered broadcast and/or multicast data, if any exists.|$|E
50|$|Each packet {{contains}} the ETX from the sender to the root. If a node receives a packet with ETX lower than its own this indicates an inconsistency in the tree.

50|$|Since beacon {{frames are}} sent using the {{mandatory}} 802.11 carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) algorithm, the access point must wait if a client device {{is sending a}} frame when the beacon is to be sent. As a result, the actual time between beacons may be longer than the beacon interval. Client devices that awaken from power-save mode may find {{that they have to}} wait longer than expected to receive the next <b>beacon</b> <b>frame.</b> Client devices, however, compensate for this inaccuracy by utilizing the time-stamp found within the <b>beacon</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies of}} the {{performance}} of IEEE 802. 11 consider scenarios of ad-hoc topology networks and do not contemplate the network broadcast information contained in <b>beacon</b> <b>frames.</b> The paper presents a study {{of the performance of}} a WLAN whose infrastructure's topology is such that the access point is in charge of broadcasting the <b>beacon</b> <b>frames.</b> Thus, it is more realistic than previous studies, because <b>beacon</b> <b>frames</b> are usually transmitted in order to announce control information and network identity. Furthermore, in the coverage area, user stations are likely to be working at different data rates, depending on their signal quality. Because <b>beacon</b> <b>frames</b> must be received by all stations, they are transmitted at the lowest data rate operating in the coverage area.

50|$|Infrastructure {{network access}} points send beacons at a defined interval, {{which is often}} set to a default 100ms. In {{the case of an}} ad hoc network where there are no access points, a peer station is {{responsible}} for sending the beacon. After an ad hoc station receives a <b>beacon</b> <b>frame</b> from a peer, it waits a random amount of time. After that random timeout has elapsed, it will send a <b>beacon</b> <b>frame</b> unless another station has already sent one. In this way, the responsibility of sending beacon frames is rotated amongst all the peers in the ad hoc network, while ensuring that beacons will always be sent.|$|E
50|$|Finally, beacons enable {{devices to}} have power saving modes. Access points will {{hold on to}} packets destined for {{stations}} that are currently sleeping. In the traffic indication map of a <b>beacon</b> <b>frame,</b> the access point is able to inform stations that they have frames waiting for delivery.|$|E
5000|$|The PCF {{is located}} {{directly}} above the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), in the IEEE 802.11 MAC Architecture.Channel access in PCF mode is centralized {{and hence the}} point coordinator sends CF-Poll frame to the PCF capable station to permit it to transmit a frame. In case the polled station {{does not have any}} frames to send, then it must transmit null frame.Due to the priority of PCF over DCF, stations that only use DCF might not gain access to the medium. To prevent this, a repetition interval has been designed to cover both (Contention free)PCF & (Contention Based)DCF traffic. The repetition interval which is repeated continuously, starts with a special control frame called <b>Beacon</b> <b>Frame.</b> When stations hear the <b>beacon</b> <b>frame,</b> they start their network allocation vector {{for the duration of the}} contention free period of the repetition period.|$|E

In IBSS network beacon generation is distributed among the stations.|$|E
50|$|Beacon frames must be sent {{with the}} CSMA/CA algorithm. This {{means that if}} a station is {{currently}} sending a frame when the beacon needs to be sent, it must wait. This means that beacons may not be sent as frequently as the beacon interval would indicate. However, stations are able to compensate for this difference by inspecting the timestamp in the <b>beacon</b> <b>frame</b> when it is finally sent.|$|E
50|$|While beacon frames do {{cause some}} non-trivial {{overhead}} for a network, they are vital {{for the proper}} operation of a network. Radio NICs generally scan all RF channels searching for beacons announcing {{the presence of a}} nearby access point. When a radio receives a <b>beacon</b> <b>frame,</b> it receives information about the capabilities and configuration of that network, and is also then able to provide a list of available eligible networks, sorted by signal strength.

5000|$|Though {{similar to}} the iBeacon profile {{released}} by Apple in 2013, Eddystone can be implemented without restriction. Eddystone also contains a telemetry frame (Eddystone-TLM) designed for reporting on a beacon's health, including, for example, battery level. Like other beacon technology, beacons with Eddystone can give devices a better indication of what objects and places are around them. Importantly, beacons do not generally accept connections from other devices, meaning that the beacon itself cannot record what devices are in its vicinity. In many cases, {{the simplicity of the}} <b>beacon</b> <b>frame</b> means that an app (for example Google Chrome) is required in order to interpret the beacon's signal.|$|E
5000|$|Hiding {{the network}} name may prevent less {{technically}} inclined people from connecting to the network, {{but will not}} deter a determined adversary. Use of WPA or WPA2 is recommended instead. Hiding the SSID removes it from beacon frames, but this {{is only one of}} several ways an SSID can be discovered. [...] When one chooses to hide the network name from the router's setup page, that only sets the SSID in the <b>beacon</b> <b>frame</b> to null, but there remain four other ways that the SSID is transmitted. In fact, hiding broadcast of the SSID on the router may cause the Network interface controller (NIC) to constantly disclose the SSID, even when out of range.|$|E

If a IEEE 802. 11 packet is received, the WLAN card stores a timestamp that precisely depicts the time at which the packet was received. Using these timestamps, we developed an algorithm that calculates the relative clock drift between two nodes and conducted many experimental measurements using offthe-shelf WLAN cards showing the clock drifts under different circumstances. Knowing the relative clock drifts is important for two-way time-of-arrival (TOA) location tracking. I...|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a two-stage {{adaptive frequency hopping}} (AFH) method facing a clustered wireless sensor network (WSN). The method includes following steps: establishing a clustered WSN defining a super frame structure based on IEEE 802. 15. 4 according to the topology structure of the above clustered WSN expanding {{the content of the}} <b>beacon</b> <b>frame</b> load based on the original <b>beacon</b> <b>frame</b> format of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 media access control (MAC) layer according to the above super frame structure and the expanded <b>beacon</b> <b>frame</b> of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 MAC layer, implementing the process of two-stage AFH for network nodes. The use of the clustered WSN in the invention enlarges the network scope, reduces the difficulty of maintenance and management, and improves the system flexibility. The design of the two-stage frequency hopping method ensures the compatibility of IEEE 802. 15. 4 and the reliability of the system. The <b>beacon</b> <b>frame</b> load is based on IEEE 802. 15. 4, thus during the channel handoff, {{there is no need to}} design a special frame for broadcasting channel distribution results. The network design is simplified, the number of frame for control is reduced, and the throughput of the network is improved...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEvery day {{large number}} of users connect to IEEE 802. 11 {{networks}} in order to access the Internet and all sort of services. But, due to their unplanned and unregulated nature, and {{to the lack of}} admission control and Quality of Service Guarantees, these wireless networks can be confronted to a traffic demand that can exceed the network capacity. In this case, if a device tries to send more traffic, or if a new device joins the network, the aggregate throughput does not necessarily increase. In this paper we show that it is possible for IEEE 802. 11 Stations to detect a saturated channel by passively monitoring the <b>beacon</b> <b>frames.</b> Access Points send <b>beacon</b> <b>frames</b> periodically and encode them using the strongest modulation and coding scheme, so that even stations further away from the sending Access Points can decode them correctly. When sending beacons, Access Points sense the channel first and, if it is busy, delay sending the frame, resulting in unevenly spaced <b>beacon</b> <b>frames,</b> whenever other transmitters are active. We present several experiments, under varying traffic loads, and analyze the distribution of the beacon jitter, whose variance increases as the offered load increases. We show {{that it is possible to}} determine, with an acceptable error rate, whether a channel is saturated by comparing the distribution of the beacon jitter with a reference distribution corresponding to a saturated channel...|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} 802.11 MAC defines another {{coordination function}} called the point coordination function (PCF). This {{is available only}} in [...] "infrastructure" [...] mode, where stations {{are connected to the}} network through an Access Point (AP). This mode is optional, and only very few APs or Wi-Fi adapters actually implement it. APs send <b>beacon</b> <b>frames</b> at regular intervals (usually every 0.1024 second). Between these <b>beacon</b> <b>frames,</b> PCF defines two periods: the Contention Free Period (CFP) and the Contention Period (CP). In the CP, DCF is used. In the CFP, the AP sends Contention-Free-Poll (CF-Poll) packets to each station, one at a time, to give them the right to send a packet. The AP is the coordinator. Although this allows for a better management of QoS, PCF does not define classes of traffic as is common with other QoS systems (e.g. 802.1p and DiffServ).|$|R
