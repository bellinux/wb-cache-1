25|$|The state {{legislature}} created State Route 111 in 1931, running west from SR-71 in Draper to SR-68 in Riverton. State Route 159, added in 1933, continued west from Riverton through Herriman to Lark {{and then turned}} north along the Oquirrh foothills to U.S. Route 50 (US-50), present-day SR-171 (3500 South), near Magna. The two routes were combined as SR-111 in 1945, and in 1957 the east end was extended north along 700 East, which had been SR-71, to 7700 South north of Sandy, only to be truncated back to Draper in 1959 when SR-71 was again restored there. In 1962, the northern terminus of SR-111 was extended north slightly from 3500 South (by then SR-171) to US-50 Alternate (now SR-201). The final change was a <b>major</b> <b>truncation</b> in 1969, moving {{the south end of}} SR-111 to its present location at SR-48 near Copperton. The portion of old SR-111 from SR-68 in Riverton to SR-71 in Draper became an extension of SR-71, but the remainder was removed from the state highway system.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Paracoccidioidomycosis is {{a chronic}} granulomatous disease caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Although eosinophils have long been {{associated}} with the immune defense against helminths, the role of eosinophils in the immune response to fungal diseases is not as well studied. The eosinophil granule <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein is toxic to helminths and mammalian cells in vitro, and its release {{has been used as a}} marker of eosinophil localization and degranulation. To determine whether eosinophil infiltration and degranulation, as evidenced by the deposition of <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein, occur in lesions of P. brasiliensis, we used an immunofluorescence technique to localize the P. brasiliensis organisms and eosinophils and <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein. Initially, all tissues were stained with polyclonal antibody to <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein; subsequently, colocalization of <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein and P. brasiliensis by double staining with mouse and rabbit antibodies, respectively, was performed. Nine biopsy tissues from seven patients were analyzed. All nine biopsies showed infiltration of intact eosinophils using both the monoclonal and the polyclonal anti-major basic protein antibodies, along with the presence of P. brasiliensis. Furthermore, using the polyclonal antimajor basic protein antibody, nine of nine tissues showed extracellular <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein deposition (granular or diffuse fluorescence staining outside of intact eosinophils). The double staining procedure using the anti-major basic protein monoclonal antibody showed extracellular deposition in five of eight biopsies; in these five biopsies, approximately 60 % of the areas containing P. brasiliensis had extracellular <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein deposited on the organisms...|$|R

40|$|Studies of the {{recessive}} dystrophic form of {{epidermolysis bullosa}} (RDEB) {{have suggested that}} an abnormality in type VII collagen {{may be involved in}} the pathogenesis of this disorder. Indirect immunofluorescence {{studies have shown that the}} staining for type VII collagen along the dermal-epidermal junction is markedly reduced or absent in all but rare cases of severe, generalized RDEB. These findings imply that the genetic defect may involve type VII collagen but do not exclude the possibility that the alterations demonstrated are secondary, for example, to nonspecific proteolysis of type VII collagen. To evaluate the ability of cells of affected patients to produce type VII collagen, we cultured keratinocytes from a severely affected patient and immunoprecipitated type VII collagen from the cells. Keratinocytes were metabolically labelled with 35 S-methionine, and solubilized cell extracts were reacted with antibody to type VII collagen. The results indicate that the patient's keratinocytes synthesize type VII collagen and that the Mr of the protein synthesized does not differ from that of an unaffected control. Because cultured cells from a patient severely affected with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa produce type VII collagen, the genetic defect, at least in this patient, is unlikely to reside in a <b>major</b> <b>truncation</b> of the type VII collagen molecule...|$|R

40|$|Eosinophil {{infiltration}} {{occurs in}} a variety of allergic and inflammatory diseases. The release of preformed mediators from eosinophils may contribute to inflammatory responses. We investigated the ability of eosinophil-derived <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin to stimulate production of IL- 8 from intestinal myofibroblasts. Intestinal myofibroblasts (18 -Co cells) were incubated with <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, or a synthetic analogue of <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein, poly-l-arginine. Immunoreactive IL- 8 was measured by ELISA and IL- 8 mRNA levels were analysed by Northern blot or reverse transcription-polymerase chain assay. <b>Major</b> <b>basic</b> protein induced IL- 8 mRNA production and release of significant levels of IL- 8 immunoreactive protein. By contrast, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin stimulated little IL- 8 release. The induction of IL- 8 mRNA by poly-l-arginine was significantly inhibited by actinomycin D. These findings demonstrate a novel interaction between eosinophils and intestinal fibroblasts that may be involved in the pathogenesis of diseases associated with tissue eosinophilia...|$|R
30|$|The FVB {{combines}} a vocational apprenticeship with general education. An FVB {{can be obtained}} either in parallel to a three- to four-year apprenticeship (integrated model) or subsequent to a three- to four-year apprenticeship (consecutive model, e.g., Gonon 1994, 1997), and FVB graduates {{have the opportunity to}} study at a UAS. An FVB is thus a typical form of a hybrid qualification (Deissinger et al. 2013). However, FVB graduates usually have permission to study only in their professional field. Thus, six different school profiles exist: technical, commercial, artistic, industrial (trade), health related and social or natural science.

40|$|In antigen-challenged {{guinea pigs}} there is {{recruitment}} of eosinophils into the lungs and to airway nerves, decreased function of inhibitory M 2 muscarinic autoreceptors on parasympathetic nerves in the lungs, and airway hyperresponsiveness. A rabbit antibody to guinea pig eosinophil <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein {{was used to}} determine whether M 2 muscarinic receptor dysfunction, and the subsequent hyperresponsiveness, are due to antagonism of the M 2 receptor by eosinophil <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein. Guinea pigs were sensitized, challenged with ovalbumin and hyperresponsiveness, and M 2 receptor function tested 24 h later with the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine. Antigen-challenged guinea pigs were hyperresponsive to electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves compared with controls. Likewise, loss of M 2 receptor function was demonstrated since the agonist pilocarpine inhibited vagally-induced bronchoconstriction in control but not challenged animals. Pretreatment with rabbit antibody to guinea pig eosinophil <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein prevented hyperresponsiveness, and protected M 2 receptor function in the antigen-challenged animals without inhibiting eosinophil accumulation in the lungs or around the nerves. Thus, hyperresponsiveness is a result of inhibition of neuronal M 2 muscarinic receptor function by eosinophil <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> protein in antigen-challenged guinea pigs...|$|R
