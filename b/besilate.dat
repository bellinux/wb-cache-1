Methods: This randomized, observer-masked, single-center, crossover study included 30 patients with ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis accompanied by nasal symptoms. Patients were treated with bepotastine <b>besilate</b> 1. 5 % twice daily (7 am and 4 pm) or olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 2 % once daily (7 am) for 14 days. Following a 7 -day washout period during which only preservative-free artificial tears were used twice daily, patients were crossed over to the alternative treatment for 14 days. Parameters evaluated by twice-daily patient diaries included each treatment&# 39;s ability to relieve ocular itch, ability to relieve itchy/runny nose, ability to relieve ocular allergy symptoms, and eye drop comfort. At the conclusion of the study, patients were also asked to identify which agent provided better all-day relief of ocular itching, better all-day relief of itchy/runny nose, superior comfort, and for which treatment they would prefer a prescription. Results: According to the mean daily diary responses, bepotastine <b>besilate</b> 1. 5 % provided significantly better relief of evening ocular itch, relief of morning and evening itchy/runny nose, and relief of morning and evening ocular allergy symptoms.

Methods: Two Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized clinical trials were conducted at {{a total of six}} separate centers using the CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis. The same study design was employed for both clinical trials, with subjects randomly assigned to either BBOS 1. 5 % (n= 78) or placebo (n= 79) treatment. Each subject received one eye drop of the test agent bilaterally at different study visits 15  minutes, 8  hours, or 16  hours prior to a CAC. Primary ocular end points included changes in ocular itching reported at 3, 5, and 7  minutes and conjunctival hyperemia assessed at 7, 15, and 20  minutes following each CAC. Secondary ocular end points included chemosis as well as episcleral and ciliary hyperemia judged by investigators, and tearing (scored as either absent or present) and eyelid swelling judged by subjects. Results: A statistically significant reduction in ocular itching was observed for BBOS 1. 5 % treatment compared to placebo at all time points (P< 0. 0001), while measures for onset and 8 -hour persistence of action also reached clinical significance (ie, ≥ 1. 0  unit difference) at a majority of time points.

40|$|Objective - Histamine {{is one of}} the {{chemical}} mediators released during the acute phase of allergic rhinitis and is considered to cause the increase in epithelial permeability observed. We tried to examine the effect of histamine on nasal mucosal permeability in vivo. Material and methods - Histamine at different concentrations was administered to the nostrils of healthy subjects and the nasal transepithelial potential difference (PD) was measured. We also examined nasal mucosal permeability by means of a histochemical technique using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in guinea pigs. Results - Administration of 10 - 1 M histamine significantly reduced the nasal PD in healthy subjects. After administration of 5. 4 × 10 - 1 M histamine to the noses of guinea pigs, most of the intercellular spaces showed positive reactions to HRP and this effect was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with mepyramine and the antihistamine bepotastine <b>besilate.</b> Conclusion - These results indicate that histamine {{plays an important role in}} the change in mucosal permeability observed in allergic rhinitis in vivo via the histamine H 1 receptor...|$|E
40|$|Hypertension {{is one of}} {{the largest}} deaths causing disease for the mankind. Since it is a chronic disease it necessitates long term treatment. The {{disadvantages}} of antihypertensive drugs such as more frequent of administration, extensive first pass metabolism and variable bioavailability, make it is an ideal candidate for transdermal drug delivery systems. This article is dedicated to the review of antihypertensive transdermal patches in the perspective of enhancing the bioavailibity as well as in improving the patient compliance. The various antihypertensive drugs considered in the review includes timolol maleate, nicardipine hydrochloride, captopril, atenolol, metoprolol tartrate, clonidine, indapamide, labetolol, pinacidil, verapamil hydrochloride, nitrendipine, nifedipine, nicorandil, propranolol hydrochloride, diltiazem hydrochloride, amlodipine <b>besilate,</b> carvedilol and lisinopril. Clonidine was the first antihypertensive drug developed in the transdermal form. Currently a number of antihypertensive transdermal patches are introduced in to the pharmaceutical market. Most of the reported methods in the literature employed solvent evaporation method or solvent casting method for the preparation of transdermal patches. Depending on the release required over a period of time, the concentrations of polymer, plasticizer and penetrant were varied...|$|E
40|$|Rapacuronium bromide (rapacuronium; ORG- 9487) is a nondepolarising {{muscle relaxant}} (NMBA) {{with a low}} potency [90 % {{effective}} dose(ED 90) 1 mg/kg], which to some extent is responsible for its rapid onset of action. Because of the: high plasma clearance (5. 3 to 11. 1 mg/kg/min) of rapacuronium, its clinical duration of action following single bolus doses up to 2 mg/kg in adults is short (i. e. 1. 5 mg/kg to facilitate rapid tracheal intubation, and to use succinylcholine or rocuronium rather than rapacuronium in a rapid-sequence setting. Rapacuronium, however, is a suitable alternative to mivacurium chloride (mivacurium) and succinylcholine for short procedures (e. g. ambulatory anaesthesia). Rocuronium bromide (rocuronium) is a relatively low-potent, intermediate-acting NMBA. Its main advantage is the rapid onset of neuromuscular block whereby good or excellent intubating conditions are achieved within 60 to 90 seconds after rocuronium 0. 6 mg/kg (2 x ED 95). and within 60 to 180 seconds after smaller doses (1 to 1. 5 x ED 95). Larger doses of rocuronium (greater {{than or equal to}} 1 mg/kg) seem to be suitable for rapid-sequence induction under relatively light anaesthesia. However, it is still a matter of controversy whether, {{in the case of an}} unanticipated difficult intubation, the long duration of rocuronium administered in such large doses outweighs the many adverse effects of succinylcholine. Rocuronium has mild vagolytic effects and does not release histamine. even when administered in large doses. Rocuronium is primarily eliminated via the liver and its pharmacokinetic profile is similar to that of vecuronium bromide (vecuronium). Unlike vecuronium, rocuronium has no metabolite. Cisatracurium <b>besilate</b> (cisatracurium). the 1 R-cis, 1 'R-cis isomer of atracurium <b>besilate</b> (atracurium) is approximately 4 times more potent than atracurium. The onset time of cisatracurium is significantly slower than after equipotent doses of atracurium. The recommended intubating dose is 0. 15 to 0. 2 mg/kg (3 to 4 times ED 95). Over a wide range of clinically relevant doses the recovery proper ties of cisatracurium are affected by neither the size of the bolus dose nor by the duration of infusion. Unlike atracurium, cisatracurium does not trigger histamine release. Like atracurium. cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination. In contrast to atracurium. cisatracurium does not undergo hydrolysis by nonspecific plasma esterases. Moreover, about 77 % of the drug is cleared by organ-dependent mechanisms...|$|E
