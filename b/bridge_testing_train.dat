40|$|Field <b>testing</b> of <b>bridge</b> {{vibrations}} {{induced by}} passage of vehicle {{is an economic}} and practical form of <b>bridge</b> load <b>testing.</b> Data processing {{of this type of}} tests are usually carried out in a system identification framework using output measurements techniques which are categorized as parametric or nonparametric methods. These methods are based on the theory of probability. Learning theory which stems its origin from two separate disciplines of statistical learning theory and neural networks, presents an efficient and robust framework for data processing of such tests. In this article, the linear two layer feed forward neural network (NN) with back propagation learning rule has been adapted for strain and displacement sensors fusion of a railway <b>bridge</b> load <b>test.</b> The <b>trained</b> NN has been used for structural analysis and finite element (FE) model updating...|$|R
50|$|On 19 January 1932, {{the first}} <b>test</b> <b>train,</b> a steam locomotive, safely crossed the <b>bridge.</b> Load <b>testing</b> of the <b>bridge</b> {{took place in}} February 1932, with the four rail tracks being loaded {{with as many as}} 96 steam {{locomotives}} positioned end-to-end. The <b>bridge</b> underwent <b>testing</b> for three weeks, after which it was declared safe and ready to be opened. The construction worksheds were demolished after the bridge was completed, and the land that they were on is now occupied by Luna Park.|$|R

The NRS [16] and the ODI-I [5] were administered to measure pain and disability, respectively. Subjects also completed a global perception effect (GPE) questionnaire. This questionnaire is a 7 -point Likert-type scale comprising only one question to evaluate the subject’s self-reported improvement or deterioration after the intervention. Two clinical tests commonly used to detect muscle endurance were performed—the prone <b>bridge</b> <b>test</b> (PBT) and the supine <b>bridge</b> <b>test</b> (SBT) [17].|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Probabilistic roadmap (PRM) {{planners}} {{have been successful}} in path planning of robots with many degrees of freedom, but narrow passages in a robot’s configuration space create significant difficulty for PRM planners. This paper presents a hybrid sampling strategy in the PRM framework for finding paths through narrow passages. A key ingredient of the new strategy is the <b>bridge</b> <b>test,</b> which boosts the sampling density inside narrow passages. The <b>bridge</b> <b>test</b> relies on simple tests of local geometry and can be implemented efficiently in high-dimensional configuration spaces. The strengths of the <b>bridge</b> <b>test</b> and uniform sampling complement each other naturally and are combined to generate the final hybrid sampling strategy. Our planner was tested on point robots and articulated robots in planar workspaces. Preliminary experiments show that the hybrid sampling strategy enables relatively small roadmaps to reliably capture the connectivity of configuration spaces with difficult narrow passages. I...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Helicopter pilots {{frequently}} {{complain about}} {{low back pain}} (LBP). The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect of age, body mass index, total flying hours, smoking habit, regular sports participation and core endurance on LBP, and to determine the predictors of LBP in helicopter pilots. Methods: Twenty-one military helicopter pilots (29. 09 ± 6. 52 years) were assessed. Demographic information and total flying hours were recorded. Low back disability was evaluated with the Oswestry low back disability questionnaire. The prone <b>bridge</b> <b>test,</b> side <b>bridge</b> <b>test,</b> supine isometric chest raise test and Sorenson test were conducted to assess the core endurance. The parameters affecting the Oswestry disability score were analyzed with the Spearman’s correlation coefficient. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify the independent predictors of the Oswestry score. Dependent variable was the Oswestry score, and the independent variable were age, body mass index, total flying hours, smoking habit, regular sports participation, the prone-bridge, side-bridge, Sorenson and supine isometric chest raise test scores. Results: The low back disability was correlated with age and total flying hours (r= 0. 55, p= 0. 015; r= 0. 53, p= 0. 01). Results of the linear regression showed that age, total flying hours, smoking status, regular sports participation, the side <b>bridge</b> <b>test</b> score, the prone <b>bridge</b> <b>test</b> score were all the predictors of low back disability (...|$|R

50|$|The newly founded Forschungsgemeinschaft Rad/Schiene (Rail-wheel {{research}} community) {{from the}} industry, universities, and the railways took up works towards a conventional <b>test</b> <b>train,</b> {{this time with}} the perspective of user- and passenger-friendliness. On 19 December 1979, the group introduced the first prototype, called the Versuchsfahrzeug 1 (<b>test</b> <b>train</b> 1). By the middle of 1980, a three-part train capable of reaching 350 km/h was developed, and the name Versuchsfahrzeug 2 (<b>test</b> <b>train</b> 2) was used. This was to be tested in the then under-construction railway test facility Rheine-Feren, between the towns of Rheine and Freren. After the dry tests of the <b>test</b> <b>train</b> 1 in the early 1980s, preparations for a new prototype began, now named as the Rad/Schiene-Versuchs- und -Demonstrationsfahrzeug (Rail-wheel test and demonstration power train) (R/S-VD). In August 1982, the Deutsche Bundesbahn decided to invest 12 Million Deutsche Mark (DM) in the R/S-VD project, and changed the name to IC Experimental (InterCityExperimental).|$|R

An added reinforced concrete overlay provided an effective retrofit for the as-built footings. Increased overturning resistance was achieved by enlarging the footing plan size, by providing additional piles, or by providing tie-downs through the footing. For multi-column bents, the addition of a stiff link beam just above the footings was effective in preventing damage in the footings during testing...|$|R
