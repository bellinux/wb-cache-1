Jon {{also noted that the}} band initially wanted to create a concept album, but stated that [...] "we sort of had to tone it back a <b>bit,</b> <b>because</b> we wanted to make a double album". Soundgenerator.com reviewer Eleanor Goodman described Dreams as [...] "clear rather than grungy, soulful rather than angsty".|$|E

He praised the episode, saying {{that at the time}} of broadcast it was considered [...] "radical" [...] and said that both Farrell and Thompson managed to get across the romantic message. He called it a [...] "Trek message" [...] episode, but said that it was one of the better ones as it [...] "shines a light on an inadequacy in our own culture via an alien culture, but in this case it muddies the waters a <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> the taboo actually makes sense on the face of it."

In January 2013, Morison set up a greyhound racing syndicate alongside his former strike partner at Norwich City, Grant Holt, and the two launched the SMGH Racing Club. Talking of the racing club, Morison stated – [...] "I've got lots of kennels myself, lots of animals, lots of dogs. So me and Grant got together bought a couple of dogs and it's spiralled out of control a little <b>bit,</b> <b>because</b> we've bought seven now in the space of about three months.

The song's title alludes to the American proverb [...] "When in Rome, do as the Romans do", [...] and Chris Thile, the song's author, said [...] "The idea behind the song– and I do love it! - is if there is {{something}} better, it's worth leaning towards just a little <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> you'll have a great time here regardless." [...] Critics commented on the song favorably, with George Graham saying that [...] "When in Rome" [...] has [...] "rock energy level and some sonic manipulation, with hints of old-time Appalachian music in the fiddle, while the lyrics are definitely in the rock mode." ...|$|E
500|$|Drummer Mick Avory {{has offered}} an {{alternate}} {{explanation for the}} song's lyrics, claiming that [...] "Lola" [...] was partially inspired by Avory's frequenting of trans bars in west London. Avory said, [...] "We used to know this character called Michael McGrath. He used to hound the group a <b>bit,</b> <b>because</b> being called The Kinks did attract these sorts of people. He used {{to come down to}} Top of the Pops, and he was publicist for John Stephen's shop in Carnaby Street. He used to have this place in Earl's Court, and he used to invite me to all these drag queen acts and transsexual pubs. They were like secret clubs.

Two of these featured his lyrics set to music by members of The Band: Danko wrote the music of [...] "This Wheel's on Fire"; Manuel, who composed [...] "Tears of Rage", described how Dylan [...] "came down to the basement with a piece of typewritten paper ... and he just said, 'Have you got any music for this?' ...

500|$|Varian {{departed}} {{slightly from}} tradition. She started young horses under saddle {{at the age}} of three, beginning with a bridle and a snaffle <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> it sends clearer signals to a young horse, particularly one of sensitive disposition. [...] She then introduced the traditional hackamore, and, after a couple of months to transition between the hackamore and the snaffle, began teaching neck reining, which allows a horse to be ridden one-handed. After a year or two, when the horse became light in the hackamore, she introduced the young horse to the two-rein, using a light bosal with either a [...] "half-breed" [...] or a low-port curb bit. Once the horse understood the bit, the bosal was removed and the horse was ridden in just the curb bit for a while until ready to go into the full spade bit, at which point the horse went back into the two-rein when the spade is first introduced. She introduced horses to the spade bit {{at the age of}} seven or eight, if they had suitable conformation and temperament to carry it. When she selected and fully trained a spade bit horse for her own personal use, that particular horse stayed with her for life and was never sold.|$|E

Gowariker later clarified this, saying: [...] "What is most important for me is the planning stage. Once that is in place, implementing the ideas becomes easier.

2500|$|When NX is supported, it {{is enabled}} by default. [...] Windows allows {{programs}} to control which pages disallow execution through its API {{as well as}} through the section headers in a PE file. In the API, runtime access to the NX bit is exposed through the Win32 API calls VirtualAlloc and VirtualProtect. [...] Each page may be individually flagged as executable or non-executable. [...] Despite the lack of previous x86 hardware support, both executable and non-executable page settings have been provided since the beginning. [...] On pre-NX CPUs, the presence of the 'executable' attribute has no effect. [...] It was documented as if it did function, and, as a result, most programmers used it properly. In the PE file format, each section can specify its executability. [...] The execution flag has existed {{since the beginning of the}} format and standard linkers have always used this flag correctly, even long before the NX <b>bit.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, Windows is able to enforce the NX bit on old programs. [...] Assuming the programmer complied with [...] "best practices", applications should work correctly now that NX is actually enforced. [...] Only in a few cases have there been problems; Microsoft's own [...]NET Runtime had problems with the NX bit and was updated.|$|E
2500|$|During the episode, Ziva tells {{a witness}} {{that she and}} Tony shared a hotel room, and that she took the couch so she wouldn't have to hear Tony whine about his back. Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much {{speculation}} {{on the part of}} fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, [...] "The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really listen to what they say, I think it is pretty clear what happened: Nothing." [...] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had [...] "a tremendous amount of fun" [...] in Paris and that, [...] "Ziva had more fun with Tony than she {{thought she was going to}} have, which maybe shocked her a little <b>bit,</b> <b>because</b> she was so angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year." [...] Cote de Pablo added, [...] "Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. But all I can say is it was good."
