5|$|American Pharoah {{made his}} track debut in a maiden race over {{six and a}} half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August9. Ridden by Martin Garcia, he started as the 7–5 {{favorite}} against eight opponents. He became unsettled before the race and, after running in second place until the stretch, faded to finish fifth behind Om, Iron Fist, One Lucky Dane, and Calculator, more than nine lengths behind the winner. He ran in a <b>blinker</b> hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did the commotion in the saddling paddock. Baffert addressed his anxiety issues by removing the hood and stuffing cotton in the horse's ears for subsequent races.|$|E
25|$|In November 1993, Dutch side Feyenoord signed Larsson {{for a fee}} of £295,000. He {{made his}} league debut on 21 November 1993 as a {{substitute}} for Regi <b>Blinker</b> in a 1–1 home draw against Vitesse. Larsson took time to adjust to working and living in a foreign country and could only muster a modest 6 goals in 27 appearances in his first season. His goalscoring record improved in subsequent seasons, but he continued to be unsettled and frustrated by a combination of ever-changing coaches, being played in unfamiliar positions and latterly the club's player-rotation policy which saw him being substituted fifty or sixty minutes into a match even when playing well.|$|E
25|$|The trams were {{originally}} constructed with an entrance {{through the back}} door and exit through the middle and front doors. The conductor was seated at the back and the passengers would enter a platform before passing by the conductor. This was opposite on the trailers, which had the entrance at the front. This allowed for a common boarding area, which had the psychological effect of encouraging passengers to a greater extent board the trailer. The vehicles were equipped with <b>blinker</b> doors. MBO consisted of double doors at the front and back, and a single door in the middle. The first two TO units had the same design, while the remaining trailers had only single exit doors. The vehicles were not built with compartments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blinkers</b> {{are usually}} made of leather or plastic cups that {{are placed on}} either side of the eyes, either {{attached}} to a bridle or to an independent hood. <b>Blinkers</b> that have a peep hole cut in the back of the cup are known as visors. Many racehorse trainers believe these keep horses focused on what is in front, encouraging them to pay attention to the race rather than other distractions, such as crowds. Additionally, <b>blinkers</b> are commonly seen on driving horses, to keep them from being distracted or spooked, especially on crowded city streets. Most equestrian disciplines, other than racing and harness competition, do not permit the use of <b>blinkers</b> at any time, under penalty of elimination. In racing, <b>blinkers</b> are usually seen attached to a synthetic hood placed under the bridle. In driving, they are attached to the bridle's cheekpieces.|$|R

500|$|Originally, the Martins and Coburns each owned a {{five percent}} share in Love the Chase through the Blinkers On Racing Stable syndicate.

500|$|Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables' blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced {{in track}} bandages, but {{typically}} wore a <b>blinker</b> hood, mostly {{to help him}} focus, but also {{because he had a}} tendency to run in towards the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. [...] "He was a big fat sucker", Davis said. [...] "I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to." [...] Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as [...] "having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that I have never felt before..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{appendix}} to the war-initiating operational {{order is}} also often debated. The message of 25 November 1941 from CinC Combined Fleet (Yamamoto) to All Flagships stated, [...] "Ships of the Combined Fleet will observe radio communications procedure as follows: 1. Except in extreme emergency the Main Force and its attached force will cease communicating. 2. Other forces {{are at the}} discretion of their respective commanders. 3. Supply ships, repair ships, hospital ships, etc., will report directly to parties concerned." [...] Furthermore, [...] "In accordance with this Imperial Operational Order, the CinC of the Combined Fleet issued his operational order ... The Task Force then drew up its own operational order, which was given {{for the first time to}} the whole force at Hitokappu Bay... In paragraph four of the appendix to that document, the especially secret Strike Force was specifically directed to 'maintain strict radio silence from the time of their departure from the Inland Sea. Their communications will be handled entirely on the general broadcast communications net.'" [...] In addition, Genda recalled, in a 1947 interview, Kido Butais communications officer issuing this order, with the task force to rely (as might be expected) on flag and <b>blinker.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 22 March, Tunnys radar {{picked up}} what {{proved to be}} a large convoy. Day was breaking, and Tunny was {{maneuvering}} for a position ahead when an escorting destroyer appeared on the radar at [...] The enemy soon sighted the submarine and challenged her with a <b>blinker.</b> Tunny took advantage of a nearby rain squall for concealment and continued to close the convoy, keeping a watchful eye on the destroyer. Despite bad visibility and the pinging of the escort, Tunny continued her approach and soon found herself {{in the midst of a}} group of tankers and cargo ships. Choosing two heavily loaded cargo ships for her targets, she launched a six-torpedo attack and heard or observed hits on both. Immediately, attention on board Tunny was diverted when a small tanker nearly collided with the submarine. Tunny now obtained a setup on a destroyer moving at high speed across her stern, fired four Mark18 torpedoes, then dove quickly even as depth charges from a nearby trawler exploded on the port quarter. During the next four hours, the Japanese ships dropped 87 depth charges in an effort to finish off the submarine but without effect. Late in the day, Tunny surfaced and began a futile search for stragglers and cripples from the morning's attack. She found only debris and an oil slick.|$|E
2500|$|A {{light rain}} was falling and {{visibility}} was poor when, {{half an hour}} before morning twilight, Tunny began a radar approach. Rapidly shoaling water less than 20fathoms (37m) deep and land masses on two sides of the submarine limited her maneuverability. At , the extreme phosphorescence of the water illuminated her wake and betrayed her presence to the enemy ship, which began signaling the unidentified intruder with a <b>blinker</b> light. Despite her detection, Tunny continued the approach until she was only [...] from the target and then launched three torpedoes. The Japanese ship, now discernible as a loaded tanker, began to maneuver radically and opened fire on the submarine. Undeterred, Tunny submerged and continued the attack, firing a second volley from her stern tubes. One of these torpedoes hit the side of the tanker with a thud, but without explosion, and a small column of water erupted just forward of the tanker's bridge. Duds and prematures were a problem for American submarines early in 1943, and verification that this torpedo had indeed hit the tanker, but failed to detonate, was forthcoming when members of the tanker's crew dashed to the spot in question and began examining the impact area with flashlights. Despite continuous fire from the ship and the proximity of land, Tunny managed to stay within firing range of her target by traveling at full speed. After the tanker successfully evaded Tunnys third salvo, the submarine fired a last torpedo from [...] as the intended victim reached the passage into Hong Kong. Following this disappointing conclusion to her attack, Tunny dove in anticipation of search planes which appeared within two hours and continued their surveillance throughout the day.|$|E

2500|$|On 2 October, a Grumman J2F Duck {{aircraft}} from USCGC Eastwind {{spotted a}} trawler camouflaged {{in a field}} of unconsolidated pack ice off North Little Koldewey Island, where the Germans had set up a weather station. The camouflaged ship was visible on the aircraft's radar. Personnel from USCGC Eastwind captured the twelve crew of the weather station on 4 October. Documents captured revealed that the ship that they had spotted was the Externsteine, which was apparently escorted by a U-boat. The search for Externsteine was delayed by the weather, but on 14 October she was found trapped in ice [...] off Cape Borgen. At 21:00 on 15 November, USCGC Eastwind located Externsteine at a range of [...] of her radar, and [...] "battle stations" [...] was ordered. Captain Thomas decided to attack at a range of , [...] was also present, and illuminated the target with her searchlight. At a range of , the icebreaker fired three salvos from its 5"/38 guns (one short, one over and one across the bow). The shots landed around the vessel, and the Germans used their <b>blinker</b> light to transmit the message [...] "We give up" [...] in English. The reply, sent back in German, was [...] "Do not scuttle ship". Both icebreakers approached the ship, and the surrender was formally accepted. It was discovered that scuttling charges had been placed in the ship, but these were disarmed with the assistance of Externsteines engineering officer. Her three officers were taken back on board the vessel during the disarming as a way of guaranteeing that the ship would not be scuttled.|$|E
2500|$|According to a 1942 Japanese after action report, [...] "In {{order to}} keep strict radio silence, steps such as taking off fuses in the circuit, and holding and sealing the keys were taken. During the operation, the strict radio silence was {{perfectly}} carried out... The Kido Butai used the radio instruments {{for the first time}} on the day of the attack since they had been fixed at the base approximately twenty days before and proved they worked well. Paper flaps had been inserted between key points of some transmitters on board [...] to keep the strictest radio silence..." [...] Commander Genda, who helped plan the attack, stated, [...] "We kept absolute Radio Silence." [...] For two weeks before the attack, the ships of Kido Butai used flag and light signals (semaphore and <b>blinker),</b> which were sufficient since task force members remained in line of sight for the entire transit time. Kazuiyoshi Koichi, the Communications Officer for , dismantled vital transmitter parts and kept them in a box that he used as a pillow to prevent Hiei from making any radio transmissions until the attack commenced. Lieutenant Commander Chuichi Yoshoka, communications officer of the flagship, Akagi, said he did not recall any ship sending a radio message before the attack. Furthermore, Captain Kijiro, in charge of the Kido Butais three screening submarines, stated nothing of interest happened on the way to Hawaii, presumably including signals received from the supposedly radio silent Kido Butai. Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka stated, [...] "It is needless to say that the strictest radio silence was ordered to be maintained in every ship of the Task Force. To keep radio silence was easy to say, but not so easy to maintain." [...] There is nothing in the Japanese logs or after action report indicating that radio silence was broken until after the attack. Kusaka worried about this when it was briefly broken on the way home.|$|E

Because of the low base rate of these so-called non-blinkers, studies on mechanisms underlying non-blinkers' absent AB are extremely scant. The few existent studies found non-blinkers to be faster and more efficient in information processing compared to <b>blinkers.</b> A personality trait that has been linked previously to speed and efficiency of information processing {{as well as to}} the magnitude of the AB is impulsivity. Therefore, the present study investigated whether 15 non-blinkers and 15 <b>blinkers</b> differed from each other in functional and/or dysfunctional impulsivity. To obtain a better understanding of the underlying processing mechanisms, the P 300 component in the event-related potential was recorded during performance on the AB task. Our results indicated higher functional impulsivity in non-blinkers compared to <b>blinkers</b> but no differences between the two groups in dysfunctional impulsivity. As indicated by shorter P 300 latency, non-blinkers processed information faster than <b>blinkers</b> after the AB period but slower during the AB period. These speed effects, however, were not associated with functional impulsivity. Thus, impulsivity and speed of information processing appear to represent two rather independent sources for non-blinkers' absent A...|$|R
