5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{commonly}} studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the exact cause is unknown {{in the majority of}} cases. It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. As of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51.1 million people. Rates are similar <b>between</b> <b>countries</b> and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to their symptoms differing from those of boys. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition.|$|E

The only rail carrier to formally propose and secure permission for such a service up to now is Deutsche Bahn, which intends to run services between London and Germany and the Netherlands. The sale of High Speed One by the British Government having effectively nationalised LCR in June 2009 is also likely to stimulate competition on the line.|$|E

40|$|Tests of {{hypotheses}} {{explaining the}} variation in church attendance are dominated {{by the use of}} international comparative survey data covering many countries with {{only a limited number of}} samples within these countries. As a result, the main research focus is on <b>between</b> <b>country</b> effects and hardly on within country effects. The latter, however, comprises a more convincing test, because fewer assumptions about unobserved country-specific variables are required. Elaborating on various analytical models, we show that results from a <b>between</b> <b>country</b> research design may lead to inaccurate conclusions. To illustrate this point, we selected the Mannheim Eurobarometer Trend File, which includes as many European countries on as many points in time as possible. Step by step we disentangle the well-known strong negative overall <b>between</b> <b>country</b> correlation of social security with church attendance. We show that this correlation most likely is owing to unspecified country characteristics, as within countries, social security is sometimes positively related to church attendance and sometimes negatively, whereas on average there is no effect at all. Rather than increases in social security spending, rising gross domestic product seems to reduce church attendance. Our cautionary tale about the use of <b>between</b> <b>country</b> research designs applies to other fields of research as well...|$|R

5|$|In the General Theory and later, Keynes {{responded to}} the socialists and left-wing liberals who argued, {{especially}} during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. He argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that didn't pit the interests of countries against each other, and {{a high degree of}} freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict <b>between</b> <b>countries.</b> His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and later {{to the creation of the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and eventually the World Trade Organization) were aimed to give effect to this vision.|$|E
5|$|In {{the century}} {{prior to the}} UN's creation, several {{international}} treaty organizations and conferences had been formed to regulate conflicts between nations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.

However, the League lacked representation for colonial peoples (then half the world's population) and significant participation from several major powers, including the US, USSR, Germany, and Japan; it failed to act against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935, the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, and German expansions under Adolf Hitler that culminated in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|RIRP {{rests on}} several assumptions, {{including}} efficient markets, no country risk premia, and zero {{change in the}} expected real exchange rate. The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will equalize <b>between</b> <b>countries</b> and that capital mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage. There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among emerging markets in Asia and also Japan. The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be reflective of differences {{in the degree of}} financial integration among the country groups analyzed. RIRP does not hold over short time horizons, but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of five to ten years.|$|E

40|$|Recently, several checklists {{systematically}} assessed {{factors that}} affect the transferability of cost-effectiveness (CE) studies between jurisdictions. The role of the threshold value for a QALY has been given little consideration in these checklists, even though {{the importance of a}} factor as a cause of <b>between</b> <b>country</b> differences in CE depends on this threshold. In this paper, we study the impact of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) per QALY on the importance of transferability factors in the case of smoking cessation support (SCS). We investigated, for several values of the WTP, how differences <b>between</b> six <b>countries</b> affect the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) of SCS. The investigated factors were demography, smoking prevalence, mortality, epidemiology and costs of smoking-related diseases, resource use and unit costs of SCS, utility weights and discount rates. We found that when the WTP decreased, factors that mainly affect health outcomes became less important and factors that mainly effect costs became more important. With a WTP below € 1, 000, the factors most responsible for <b>between</b> <b>country</b> differences in INMB were resource use and unit costs of SCS and the costs of smoking-related diseases. Utility values had little impact. At a threshold above € 10, 000, <b>between</b> <b>country</b> differences were primarily due to different discount rates, utility weights and epidemiology of smoking-related diseases. Costs of smoking-related diseases had little impact. At all thresholds, demography had little impact. We concluded that, when judging the transferability of a CE study, we should consider the <b>between</b> <b>country</b> differences in WTP threshold values...|$|R
