25|$|The Second Book of Enoch {{contains}} a section, called Exaltation of Melchizedek, {{which says that}} Melchizedek was born of a virgin, Sofonim (or Sopanima), the wife of Nir, a brother of Noah. The child came out from his mother after she had died {{and sat on the}} <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> her corpse, already physically developed, clothed, speaking and blessing the Lord, and marked with the badge of priesthood. Forty days later, Melchizedek was taken by the archangel Gabriel (Michael in some manuscripts) to the Garden of Eden and was thus preserved from the Deluge without having to be in Noah's Ark.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} Ivar Kreuger {{was in the}} United States and was asked to return to Europe {{for a meeting with}} the {{chairman}} of the Riksbank, Ivar Rooth. He had left Sweden for the last time on November 23, 1931 and returned to Europe on the ship Ile de France, arriving in Paris on March 11, 1932. The meeting with Ivar Rooth was scheduled to take place on March 13 or 14 in Berlin. He met with Krister Littorin (vice president of Kreuger & Toll holding) and his own banker Oscar Rydbeck in Paris on March 11 to prepare for the Berlin meeting. But on March 12, he was found dead in bed in his apartment at Avenue Victor Emanuel III. After questioning Kreuger's servants (his French maid, Mademoiselle Barrault, and the janitor who had had contact with Kreuger in the morning) the French police and a physician {{came to the conclusion that}} he had shot himself some time between 10:45a.m. and 12:10p.m. A 9-mm semi-automatic gun was found on the <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> the body.|$|E

500|$|Mendes {{encouraged}} some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> Carolyn, {{the director}} asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, [...] "I wanted that {{not just because}} it was funny but because I didn't want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking. [...] is so in control—I wanted him to break through." [...] Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not always keep a straight face, which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times. The production used small amounts of computer-generated imagery. Most of the rose petals in Lester's fantasies were added in post-production, although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed. When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose-petal bath, the steam was real, save for in the overhead shot. To position the camera, a hole had to be cut in the ceiling, through which the steam escaped; it was instead added digitally.|$|E
2500|$|The Second Book of Enoch (also called [...] "Slavonic Enoch") is {{apparently}} a Jewish sectarian {{work of the}} 1st century AD. The last section of the work, the Exaltation of Melchizedek, tells how Melchizedek was born of a virgin, Sofonim (or Sopanima), the wife of Nir, a brother of Noah. The child came out from his mother after she had died {{and sat on the}} <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> her corpse, already physically developed, clothed, speaking and blessing the Lord, and marked with the badge of priesthood.

2500|$|Hopper's Room in New York (1932) and Cape Cod Evening (1939) {{are prime}} {{examples}} of his [...] "couple" [...] paintings. In the first, {{a young couple}} appear alienated and uncommunicative—he reading the newspaper while she idles by the piano. The viewer takes {{on the role of}} a voyeur, as if looking with a telescope through the window of the apartment to spy on the couple's lack of intimacy. In the latter painting, an older couple with little to say to each other, are playing with their dog, whose own attention is drawn away from his masters. Hopper takes the couple theme to a more ambitious level with Excursion into Philosophy [...] (1959). A middle-aged man sits dejectedly {{on the edge of a}} <b>bed.</b> <b>Beside</b> him lies an open book and a partially clad woman. A shaft of light illuminates the floor in front of him. Jo Hopper noted in their log book, [...] "he open book is Plato, reread too late".|$|E

60|$|Later on, strolling with Possum on {{the main}} deck, as I passed {{the open door of}} the {{hospital}} I heard the muttering chant of O'Sullivan, and peeped in. There he lay, lashed fast on his back in the lower bunk, rolling his eyes and raving. In the top bunk, directly above, lay Charles Davis, calmly smoking a pipe. I looked for the marlin-spike. There it was, ready to hand, on the <b>bedding</b> <b>beside</b> him.|$|R
2500|$|While {{shooting}} {{a movie in}} Arizona, Stewart {{received a phone call}} from Dr. Keagy, his veterinarian, who informed him that Beau was terminally ill, and that Gloria sought his permission to perform euthanasia. Stewart declined to give a reply over the phone, and told Keagy to [...] "keep him alive and I'll be there." [...] Stewart requested several days' leave, which allowed him to spend some time with Beau before granting the doctor permission to euthanize the sick dog. Following the procedure, Stewart sat in his car for ten minutes to clear his eyes of tears. Stewart later remembered:After [...] died there were a lot of nights when I was certain that I could feel him get into <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> me and I would reach out and pat his head. The feeling was so real that I wrote a poem about it and how much it hurt to realize that he wasn’t going to be there any more.|$|E
2500|$|Alas, {{with what}} sadness his friends {{came to know}} {{that while he was}} doing so much to warn and restore others from the effects of this fearful habit, he himself was still under its bondage. Again and again he seemed to have broken it. Only those most {{intimate}} with him knew how he suffered at such periods... I recall a night he passed with me some months after the publication of [...] He was in an excited state, and we took a long walk together, during which he spoke freely of his varied trials, and he finally went to my house to sleep. I went directly to bed, but he was a long time making his preparations, and I at length suspected he was indulging his old craving. For the first and only time in my life I spoke harshly to him, and characterized his abuse of himself and of the confidence of his friends as shameful. He replied depreciatingly, and turning down the gas-light came around and crept into <b>bed</b> <b>beside</b> me. We both lay a moment in silence, and feeling reproved for my harshness, I said: “Think, Fitz, of your warnings on the subject, and of your effort, in behalf of other victims.” In a tone and with a pathos I can never forget, he answered — “He saved others, himself he could not save.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of an electrochemically generated gas phase on the hydrodynamic {{characteristics of a}} three-phase system has been examined. The two-phase fluid, (gas-liquid), in which the liquid phase is the continuous one, flows through a packed bed with glass spheres. The {{influence of}} the liquid velocity was examined, {{as well as the}} gas velocity and particle diameter on the pressure drop through the fixed bed. It was found that with increasing liquid velocity (wl = 0. 0162  0. 03 m/s), the relative pressure drop decreases through the fixed bed. With increasing current density, the pressure drop increases, since greater gas quantities stay behind in the fixed <b>bed.</b> <b>Besides,</b> it was found that with decreasing diameter of the glass particles, the relative pressure drop also decreases. The relationship betweeen the experimentally obtained friction factor and the Reynolds number was established...|$|R

6000|$|His wife--her {{name was}} Kathleen--smiled. She looked very pretty and cool, Mr. Bosengate thought.

Close to the red-brick lodge his two children, Kate and Harry, ran out from under the acacia trees, and waved to him, scrambling bare-legged on to the low, red, ivy-covered wall which guarded his domain of eleven acres. Mr. Bosengate waved back, thinking: 'Jolly couple--by Jove, they are!' Above their heads, through the trees, he could see right away to some Downs, faint in the July heat haze.

50|$|Subject-verb {{inversion}} in English {{is a type}} of inversion {{where the}} subject and verb (or chain of verbs, verb catena) switch their canonical order of appearance, so that the subject follows the verb(s), e.g. A lamp stood <b>beside</b> the <b>bed</b> → <b>Beside</b> the <b>bed</b> stood a lamp. Subject-verb inversion is distinct from subject-auxiliary inversion because the verb involved is not an auxiliary verb.|$|R
