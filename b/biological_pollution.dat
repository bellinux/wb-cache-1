Recent scholarship states that the discussion of outcastes in post-Vedic texts {{is different from the}} system widely discussed in colonial era Indian literature, and in Dumont's structural theory on caste system in India. Patrick Olivelle, a professor of Sanskrit and Indian Religions and credited with modern translations of Vedic literature, Dharma-sutras and Dharma-sastras, states that ancient and medieval Indian texts do not support the ritual pollution, purity-impurity premise implicit in the Dumont theory. According to Olivelle, purity-impurity is discussed in the Dharma-sastra texts, but only {{in the context of the}} individual's moral, ritual and <b>biological</b> <b>pollution</b> (eating certain kinds of food such as meat, going to bathroom). Olivelle writes in his review of post-Vedic Sutra and Shastra texts, [...] "we see no instance when a term of pure/impure is used with reference to a group of individuals or a varna or caste". The only mention of impurity in the Shastra texts from the 1st millennium is about people who commit grievous sins and thereby fall out of their varna. These, writes Olivelle, are called [...] "fallen people" [...] and considered impure in the medieval Indian texts. The texts declare that these sinful, fallen people be ostracised. Olivelle adds that the overwhelming focus in matters relating to purity/impurity in the Dharma-sastra texts concerns [...] "individuals irrespective of their varna affiliation" [...] and all four varnas could attain purity or impurity by the content of their character, ethical intent, actions, innocence or ignorance (acts by children), stipulations, and ritualistic behaviors.|$|E

50|$|Pollution: Severe {{eutrophication}} {{caused by}} polluted runoff has made red tides in the Bohai Bay common. Combined with overfishing, this has {{put pressure on}} once-abundant fish stocks. <b>Biological</b> <b>pollution</b> is also a problem, with illegal ballast water discharges creating a strong danger of invasive exotic species.

The eggs of these turtles are specially procured from river Chambal. Around 2000 tortoise are released annually in the river. Between 1987 and 2010 around 33,356 tortoises were released in the River Ganges by the Kashi Wildlife Division’s tortoise breeding centre, Sarnath. To protect these tortoise and secure their habitat Kachhua Sanctuary, spreading over seven km. from Rajghat (Malviya Rail Road Bridge) to Ramnagar Fort, {{was declared}} Wildlife Protection Zone, under U.P. Govt. Order (No. 4170/04-3-62/89 dated 21-12-1989) under {{the provisions of the}} Wildlife Protection Act 1972, after launching the Ganga Action Plan (GAP). The existence of motor boats and sand mining in the protected zone of the Sanctuary is prohibited, as tortoise lay eggs in the sand of the river banks. Tortoise Sanctuary has its own importance to clean the water. In the Kachhua (tortoise) Sanctuary mainly Aspederites Gangetic (self shell turtles), Geoclamis, Hamiltonai, Chitra Indica and Lasimous which are carnivorous species and hard shelled herbivorous tortoise- Pechra, Kachhua, Sundri Kachhua, Kachhua Tentoria, Kachhua Tongoka are in abundance. Rohu, Bhakur, Tengra, Prawn, Nain, Bam etc. fish are also found in the Sanctuary. Gangetic dolphin can also be seen especially during rainy season here. Tortoise and all other aquatic species are conserved/ protected and efforts are being made to increase their population in this sanctuary. Fishing and any attempt to temper with the habitat of the animals found in the Sanctuary, has been declared a cognizable offence in this stretch of the River Ganges, under 1972 Act.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies show}} a certain danger {{associated}} with drug residues, chemicals, radionuclides, biofilms, resistant bacteria and viruses, downstream of {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WTP). These results confirm the existence of hazardous substances in the hospital effluents. The University Hospital Frantz Fanon in Blida {{is located in a}} sensitive place of Mitidja. The effluents can contaminate surface water (valley Sidi El Kebir, valley Mazafran) and groundwater via infiltration and the porous nature of the soil. It is feared that the underground current (groundwater) contaminate {{a large portion of the}} basement of the Mitidja in the long run. Faced with the urgency and the risk they represent, we have developed a method called the targeted approach for more effective management of hospital waste. Indeed, in the global approach, the hospital effluents are collected by a sewer system treated in a wastewater treatment plant before being rendered in the environment. The targeted approach avoids the effluents in the sewer system of the hospital and the WTP, it neutralizes chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>pollution</b> out of each hospital unit.

Among {{the reasons for this}} <b>biological</b> <b>pollution</b> there is the recent trend of global warming, which led to the extension of distribution area of tropical and/or thermophilic species. The present investigation describes analyses of 12 S and 16 S mt-rRNA gene fragments conducted on fresh muscle tissues of Tyrrhenian Sea fishes that confirm the morphological records of Fistularia commersonii, Sphoeroides pachygaster and Trachipterus trachipterus and provides a 12 S mt-rRNA fragments database for future investigations on Remora osteochir, Tetragonurus cuvieri, Pomadasys incisus and Sudis hyalina. Among the species examined, Fistularia commersonii and Sphoeroides pachygaster are allochthonous species penetrated into the Mediterranean through Suez Canal (Red Sea) and Gibraltar Strait respectively. Pomadasys incisus is thermophilus species basically restricted to the southern parts of the Mediterranean.

In theDarß-Zingst-Bodden-Chain only 6 invasive species were observed, having the highest relative abundance (9 – 71 %). Furthermore, this areahad the highest BPL of all three areas, i. e. a strong negative impact. The BPL required a lot of data (including historical) and some ratingswere subjective and comparisons with other areas assessed were difficult and often impossible. Due to these limitations, it is suggested thatthe BPL should only be used with restrictions as a universal assessment tool for invasive species in the estuarine and lagoon waters of theBaltic Sea...|$|E
