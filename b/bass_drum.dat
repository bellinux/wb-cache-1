5|$|A Tahitian {{traditional}} dance genre {{dating back}} to before the first contact with European explorers is ʻōteʻa, danced {{by a group of}} men accompanied solely by a drum ensemble. The drums consist of a slit-log drum called tō‘ere (which provides the main rhythmic pattern), a single-headed upright drum called fa‘atete, a single-headed hand drum called pahu tupa‘i rima, and a double-headed <b>bass</b> <b>drum</b> called tariparau.|$|E
5|$|Jack White's {{voice is}} a singular, evocative {{combination}} of punk, metal, blues, and backwoods while his guitar work is grand and banging with just enough lyrical touches of slide and subtle solo work... Meg White balances out the fretwork and the fretting with methodical, spare, and booming cymbal, <b>bass</b> <b>drum,</b> and snare... All D.I.Y. punk-country-blues-metal singer-songwriting duos should sound this good.|$|E
5|$|Moon {{played a}} four, then a five-piece drum kit during his early career. His 1965 set {{consisted}} of Ludwig drums and Zildjian cymbals. By 1966, feeling limited {{by this setup}} and inspired by Ginger Baker's double <b>bass</b> <b>drum,</b> he switched to a larger Premier kit. This setup {{did not have a}} hi-hat, since Moon used crash and ride cymbals instead. He remained a loyal customer of Premier.|$|E

5|$|Connotations is scored {{for full}} symphony {{orchestra}} with augmented percussion. The complete ensemble includes piccolo, three flutes (third flute doubling second piccolo), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, E-flat clarinet, bass clarinet, three bassoons (third bassoon doubling contrabassoon), six horns, four trumpets, four trombones, tuba, tympani, five percussionists (glockenspiel, vibraphone, xylophone, conga drums, timbales, cymbals, metal sheet, tam-tam, triangle, claves, temple block, woodblock, <b>bass</b> <b>drum,</b> snare drum, tenor drum), piano (doubling celesta) and strings.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level has been added in World Tour. This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with <b>bass</b> <b>drum</b> beats, and allowing any or no fret button to be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be hit (for drums), or any sound to be made (for vocals).|$|E
5|$|In {{more general}} usage, noise is any {{unwanted}} sound or signal. In this sense, even sounds {{that would be}} perceived as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver. Prevention and reduction of unwanted sound, from tape hiss to squeaking <b>bass</b> <b>drum</b> pedals, is important in many musical pursuits, but noise is also used creatively in many ways, and in some way in nearly all genres.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "bass line" [...] is {{a unique}} musical {{ensemble}} consisting of graduated pitch marching <b>bass</b> <b>drums</b> commonly found in marching bands and drum and bugle corps. Each drum plays a different note, and this gives the bass line a unique task in a musical ensemble. Skilled lines execute complex linear passages split among the drums to add an additional melodic element to the percussion section. This is characteristic of the marching bass drum—its purpose is to convey complex rhythmic and melodic content, not {{just to keep the}} beat. The line provides impact, melody, and tempo {{due to the nature of}} the sound of the instruments. The bass line usually has from as many as seven <b>bass</b> <b>drums</b> to as few as two. But most high school drumlines consist of between 3 and 5. <b>Bass</b> <b>drums</b> used in such ensembles are usually those that use 2 mallets (formerly scorch <b>bass</b> <b>drums,</b> to distinguish them from those <b>bass</b> <b>drums</b> that formerly used one mallet, known in the 1930s as standard <b>bass</b> <b>drums).</b>|$|R

5|$|John Adams (born October 9, 1951) is a {{dedicated}} {{fan of the}} Cleveland Indians, a Major League Baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. Adams has played his <b>bass</b> <b>drum</b> in the bleacher seats during nearly every Indians home game since 1973, which has brought him notoriety and recognition from the Indians and other organizations. The Indians pay for two season tickets for Adams and his drum, he {{has been involved in}} two ceremonial first pitches, and he is the only fan for whom the Indians have dedicated a bobblehead day.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a {{second-hand}} drum kit {{consisting of}} a snare drum, <b>bass</b> <b>drum</b> and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, {{who went on to}} book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.|$|E
5|$|The band {{continued}} to tour as a duo, with Linnell playing accordion and Flansburgh on guitars, or occasionally playing a marching band <b>bass</b> <b>drum.</b> Large posters of postage stamps adorned the stage as props; the minimal arrangement was {{received as a}} boldly simple choice. Sets included a combination {{of old and new}} material. As in the past, the band was backed by a tape deck playing drum tracks or a metronome in lieu of a full rhythm section.|$|E

5|$|During a gig with a {{stand-in}} drummer in late April at the Oldfield, {{the band}} first met Keith Moon. Moon {{grew up in}} Wembley, and had been drumming in bands since 1961. He was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, and wanted to play full-time. Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking a <b>bass</b> <b>drum</b> pedal and tearing a drum skin. The band were impressed with his energy and enthusiasm, and offered him the job. Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to the Who. The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong <b>bass</b> <b>drum</b> and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E
5|$|The opera is scored for 2 flutes, {{the second}} {{doubling}} piccolo, 2 oboes, 1 doubling oboe d'amore, {{and the other}} doubling cor anglais, a clarinet and bass clarinet, a bassoon and contrabassoon, 4 horns, a flugelhorn, 4 trombones, a bass trombone, 1 timpanist, 3 percussionists, harp, electronic keyboard doubling piano and a string section consisting of at least six each first and second violins, 5 violas, four cellos and 3 double basses, including at least one bass with a 5th string or low extension, plus an improvising jazz player on amplified bass. The percussion consists of marimba, vibraphone, glockenspiel, crotales, tubular bells, cow bells, <b>bass</b> <b>drum,</b> tam-tam, sizzle cymbal, suspended cymbal, mark-tree, Chinese bell-tree and wind-machine.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{lives in}} Brecksville, Ohio, {{a suburb of}} Cleveland. He {{attended}} both Saint Ignatius High School in Cleveland and Parma Senior High School in Parma, Ohio, where he played <b>bass</b> <b>drum</b> in band before graduating high school in 1969. He graduated college from Cleveland State University, where he intends to pursue his master's degree. He is divorced and {{does not have any}} children. Adams worked on computer systems for AT until being laid off in October 2016. He has been teaching an aquatics class for students with disabilities, without pay, at Cleveland State University since 1978. Adams has also volunteered his time {{as a member of the}} Kiwanis service club and the community emergency response team in his hometown and has taught CPR and water safety.|$|E
5|$|Adams still {{uses the}} same 26-inch-wide <b>bass</b> <b>drum</b> he began with in 1973. He has stated that he bought {{it as part of}} a set for $25 at a garage sale. It has the same head {{on the side of the}} drum that Adams does not beat, but Adams has stated that he replaces the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets of mallets each year. During games, Adams tends to drum at {{particular}} moments: when the Indians take the field at the beginning of the game, if the Indians have runners in scoring position, if the Indians are tied or trailing near the end of the game, or if they are winning at the top of the ninth inning. Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer Herb Score. It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official.|$|E
5|$|At 0:35, {{the camera}} {{cuts to the}} {{aftermath}} of The Shot. A young man jumps {{in the air and}} pumps his fist as another young man in an opposing jersey sinks to the floor. The moment is from the 1989 NBA Playoffs, when Jordan hit a game-winning jump shot over Cleveland Cavaliers guard Craig Ehlo. At 0:38 is Jordan's last shot with the Chicago Bulls, after a crossover dribble past Utah Jazz guard Bryon Russell at the end of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. These scenes are musically punctuated with a <b>bass</b> <b>drum</b> roll and a cymbal crash. Finally, at 0:44 a young man shrugs after hitting a shot, as Jordan shrugged after scoring six three-point field goals {{in the first half of}} Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E
