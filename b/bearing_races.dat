50|$|PWM drives are {{inherently}} associated with high-frequency common-mode voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings. When these high-frequency voltages find {{a path to}} earth through a bearing, transfer of metal or electrical discharge machining (EDM) sparking occurs between the bearing's ball and the <b>bearing's</b> <b>race.</b> Over time, EDM-based sparking causes erosion in the <b>bearing</b> <b>race</b> {{that can be seen}} as a fluting pattern. In large motors, the stray capacitance of the windings provides paths for high-frequency currents that pass through the motor shaft ends, leading to a circulating type of bearing current. Poor grounding of motor stators can lead to shaft-to-ground bearing currents. Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high-frequency bearing currents.|$|R

5000|$|Waviness {{measurements}} {{are not as}} common as roughness measurement however there are important applications. For example, waviness in bearing balls and <b>bearing</b> <b>races</b> {{is one of the}} reasons for vibrations and noise in ball bearings.

5000|$|... 1876: William Brown in Birmingham, England, {{patented}} {{a design}} for the wheels of roller skates. Brown's design embodied his effort to keep the two bearing surfaces of an axle, fixed and moving, apart. Brown worked closely with Joseph Henry Hughes, who drew up the patent for a ball or roller <b>bearing</b> <b>race</b> for bicycle and carriage wheels in 1877. Hughes' patent included {{all the elements of}} an adjustable system. These two men are thus responsible for modern roller skate and skateboard wheels, as well as the ball <b>bearing</b> <b>race</b> inclusion in velocipedes—later to become motorbikes and automobiles. This was arguably the most important advance in the realistic use of roller skates as a pleasurable pastime.|$|R

50|$|A dustcap {{may also}} refer, on a bicycle, {{to the metal}} ring that covers the {{bearings}} in a cup-and-cone ball-bearing hubset. These types of dust caps, being press-fit, are difficult to remove with bending or damaging them. It is suggested to press them out {{from the other side}} of the hub using a screw driver. In this role the dustcap reduces the dust that enters the <b>bearing</b> <b>races,</b> and extends service intervals.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a ball bearing is to reduce {{rotational}} friction and support radial and axial loads. It achieves this by using at least two races to contain the balls and transmit the loads through the balls. In most applications, one race is stationary {{and the other is}} attached to the rotating assembly (e.g., a hub or shaft). As one of the <b>bearing</b> <b>races</b> rotates it causes the balls to rotate as well. Because the balls are rolling they have a much lower coefficient of friction than if two flat surfaces were sliding against each other.|$|E
5000|$|The {{length of}} the fork is usually {{measured}} parallel to the steerer tube {{from the bottom of}} the lower <b>bearing</b> <b>race</b> to the center of the front wheel axle. A 1996 survey of 13 700c road forks found a maximum length of 374.7 mm and a minimum of 363.5 mm. needed ...|$|R
50|$|Also if {{a bearing}} is not rotating, {{oscillating}} {{forces on the}} bearing can cause impact damage to the <b>bearing</b> <b>race</b> or the rolling elements, known as brinelling. A second lesser form called false brinelling occurs if the bearing only rotates across a short arc and pushes lubricant out away from the rolling elements.|$|R

They {{applied for}} a patent on July 15, 1914. The requirement for this tester was to quickly {{determine the effects of}} heat treatment on steel <b>bearing</b> <b>races.</b> The application was subsequently approved on February 11, 1919, and holds [...] At the time of invention, both Hugh and Stanley Rockwell worked for the New Departure Manufacturing Co. of Bristol, CT. New Departure was a major ball bearing manufacturer which in 1916 became part of United Motors and, shortly thereafter, General Motors Corp.|$|E
5000|$|Brinelling can {{be caused}} by a heavy load resting on a {{stationary}} bearing for an extended length of time. The result is a permanent dent or [...] "brinell mark". The brinell marks will often appear in evenly spaced patterns along the <b>bearing</b> <b>races,</b> resembling the primary elements of the bearing, such as rows of indented lines for needle or roller bearings or rounded indentations in ball bearings. It is a common cause of roller bearing failures, and loss of preload in bolted joints when a hardened washer is not used. For example, brinelling occurs in casters when the ball bearings within the swivel head produce grooves in the hard cap, thus degrading performance by increasing the required swivel force.|$|E
5000|$|Consisting of a {{stationary}} linear base and a moving carriage, roller slides work similarly to ball bearing slides, {{except that the}} bearings housed within the carriage are cylinder-shaped instead of ball shaped. The rollers crisscross each other at a 90° angle and move between the four semi-flat and parallel rods that surround the rollers. The rollers are between [...] "V" [...] grooved <b>bearing</b> <b>races,</b> one being on the top carriage {{and the other on}} the base. The travel of the carriage ends when it meets the end cap, a limiting component. Typically, carriages are constructed from aluminum and the rods and rollers are constructed from steel, while the end caps are constructed from stainless steel.|$|E

One A-36A, <b>bearing</b> <b>race</b> number #44, owned and flown by Kendall Everson, was entered in the 1947 Kendall Trophy Race.

50|$|The pole {{itself is}} usually a simple stand heavy enough to {{withstand}} the centrifugal forces on it. The head of the pole needs to provide a freely rotating hub, and usually incorporates a ball <b>bearing</b> <b>race</b> of some kind. In addition, where signals and power need to pass to the model, some form of slip ring arrangement is required.|$|R
50|$|Some {{bearings}} use a thick grease for lubrication, {{which is}} {{pushed into the}} gaps between the bearing surfaces, also known as packing. The grease is {{held in place by}} a plastic, leather, or rubber gasket (also called a gland) that covers the inside and outside edges of the <b>bearing</b> <b>race</b> to keep the grease from escaping.|$|R
5000|$|The methanol-fueled two-cycle {{glow plug}} engines used for aeromodelling, since their {{adoption}} by model airplane hobbyists in the 1940s, have used varying percentages of castor oil as a lubricant. It is highly resistant to degradation when the engine has its fuel-air mixture leaned for maximum engine speed. Gummy residues {{can still be}} a problem for aeromodelling powerplants lubricated with castor oil, however, usually requiring eventual replacement of ball bearings when the residue accumulates within the engine's <b>bearing</b> <b>races.</b> One British manufacturer of sleeve valved four-cycle model engines has stated the [...] "varnish" [...] created by using castor oil in small percentages can improve the pneumatic seal of the sleeve valve, improving such an engine's performance over time.|$|E
