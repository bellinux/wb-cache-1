40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that there is a {{striking}} difference in word order between Modern Japanese and Early Old Japanese. Early Old Japanese lacks the canonical transitive pattern [Subject-ga Object-o V]. The basic word order in Early Old Japanese is [Subject-ga/no Object-Ø V], in which the subject is marked by the genitive ga or no and a morphologically unmarked object must appear immediately adjacent to the verb. When the object is marked by wo, it is obligatorily moved over a subject, resulting in [Object-wo Subject-ga/no V]. Following Miyagawa (1989) and Miyagawa and Ekida (2003), I argue that a bare object is assigned abstract case under the strict adjacency requirement, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>wo</b> in Early Old Japanese does not function as an accusative case. The particle wo differs crucially from the case particle o in Modern Japanese in that it marks not only the direct object of a transitive verb, but all kinds of internal arguments of both transitive and intransitive verbs. Furthermore, wo conveys a definite interpretation. An element marked by wo moves to a particular structural position, namely Spec(vP) or Spec(CP), where it is assigned definite/topic interpretations...|$|E

30|$|Next, {{the growth}} of WO 3 {{nanorods}} from the tungsten prominence is discussed. Engel et al. investigated the tungsten face that most easily absorbed oxygen and determined that the (110) face of tungsten absorbed the most oxygen [15]. Figure 4 suggests that the side edge of the prominence was (110) of tungsten and oxygen absorbed preferentially on (110). It was also inferred <b>that</b> <b>WO</b> 3 formed preferentially on (110) of {{the edge of the}} tungsten prominence, and then oxygen absorbed on the (010) face of the WO 3 formed on the tungsten prominence. After that, the (010) and (001) faces of WO 3, which absorbed oxygen easily and are the closest and close-packed planes [16], grew. The origin of the tungsten is the bottom of the tungsten wire, so this acts as the tungsten supply for the nanorods. Therefore, {{the growth of}} WO 3 {{on the edge of the}} nanorod starts from the bottom to the top of the nanorod. The reason <b>that</b> <b>WO</b> 3 nanorod growth disappears at the area covered by the natural oxide layer when the tungsten wire was heated is that the tungsten prominence, which has the planes that easily absorb oxygen, do not grow.|$|R
40|$|The highly {{dispersed}} WO 3 ·H 2 O nanoplates {{have been}} synthesized by a facile hydrothermal reaction assisted by citrate acid.

The selective absorbance of citrate acid with many OH groups onto [010] facet of tungsten oxide precursors can result in the controlled growth of WO 3 ·H 2 O, thus leading to the good dispersion and small size of WO 3 ·H 2 O nanoplates. The electrocatalytic activity of WO 3 ·H 2 O and WO 3 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been investigated in detail. The good electrocatalytic activity for HER has been obtained, which {{may be attributed to}} the good dispersion and small size of nanoplates.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{polypyrrole}} supported WO 3 were fabricated and characterized by FT-IR, XRD, XPS, BET, TGA, and FESEM-EDX. The {{activity of the}} catalysts was tested in glycerol esterification with acetic acid, and it found <b>that</b> <b>WO</b> 3 -Ppy- 20 (nanocomposite with 20 % WO 3 loaded) showed the maximum catalyst activity with 98 % and selectivity of 70 % to triacetin at 110 °C with a reaction duration of 10 [*]h and also recorded the highest selectivity (75 %) for acetylation of glycerol to monoacetin with about 59 % conversion only. The highest acidity of WO 3 -Ppy- 20 is also confirmed using TPD-NH 3 analysis. The activity and selectivity to triacetin of the catalyst were enhanced by increasing WO 3 loading amount, resulting in 82 % conversion for WO 3 -Ppy- 5 with about 32 and 50 % selectivity to monoacetin and diacetin and about 18 % selectivity to triacetin; in case of WO 3 -Ppy- 20, these amounts were changed to 5, 25, and 70 % selectivity to monoacetin, diacetin, and triacetin, respectively with the conversion of 98 %. TPD-NH 3 analysis found <b>that</b> polypyrrole supported <b>WO</b> 3 increases the catalyst acidity of WO 3. BET and FESEM analyses revealed <b>that</b> <b>WO</b> 3 particles were well dispersed with the smallest average size in nanocomposite compared to pure WO 3, which could contribute to the high activity of WO 3 -Ppy catalyst for esterification of glycerol...|$|R
40|$|The Wee 1 kinase {{inhibits}} {{entry into}} mitosis by phosphorylation of the Cdc 2 kinase. Searching for multicopy suppressors that abolish this inhibition in the fission yeast, {{we have identified}} a novel gene, here named wos 2, encoding a protein with significant homology to human p 23, an Hsp 90 -associated cochaperone. The deletion mutant has a modest phenotype, being heat-shock sensitive. Using antibodies raised against bacterially produced protein, we determined <b>that</b> <b>Wos</b> 2 is very abundant, ubiquitously distributed in the yeast cell, and its expression dropped drastically as cells entered into early stationary phase, indicating that its function is associated with cell proliferation. In proliferating cells, the amount of Wos 2 protein was not subjected to cell cycle regulation. However, in vitro assays demonstrated that this Hsp 90 cochaperone is potentially regulated by phosphorylation. In addition to suppressing Wee 1 activity, overproduction of Wos 2 displayed synthetic lethality with Cdc 2 mutant proteins, indicating that this Hsp 90 cochaperone functionally interacts with Cdc 2. The level of Cdc 2 protein and its associated H 1 kinase activity under synthetic lethal conditions suggested a regulatory role for this Wos 2 -Cdc 2 interaction. Hsp 90 complexes are required for CDK regulation; the synergy found between the excess of Wos 2 and a deficiency in Hsp 90 activity suggests <b>that</b> <b>Wos</b> 2 could specifically interfere with the Hsp 90 -dependent regulation of Cdc 2. In vitro analysis indicated that the above genetic interactions could take place by physical association of Wos 2 with the single CDK complex of the fission yeast. Expression of the budding yeast p 23 protein (encoded by the SBA 1 gene) in the fission yeast indicated <b>that</b> <b>Wos</b> 2 and Sba 1 are functionally exchangeable and therefore that properties described here for Wos 2 could be of wide significance in understanding the biological function of cochaperone p 23 in eukaryotic cells...|$|R
