40|$|Anatomical {{science has}} used the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> the {{executed}} for dissection over many centuries. As anatomy has developed into a vehicle of not only scientific but also moral and ethical education, {{it is important to}} consider the source <b>of</b> human <b>bodies</b> for dissection and the manner of their acquisition. From the thirteenth to the early seventeenth century, the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> the executed were the only legal source <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> for dissection. Starting in the late seventeenth century, the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> unclaimed persons were also made legally available. With the developing movement to abolish the death penalty in many countries around the world and with the renunciation of the use <b>of</b> the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> the executed by the British legal system in the nineteenth century, two different practices have developed in that there are Anatomy Departments who use the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> the executed for dissection or research and those who do not. The history of the use <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> the executed in German Anatomy Departments during the National Socialist regime is an example for the insidious slide from an ethical use <b>of</b> human <b>bodies</b> in dissection to an unethical one. There are cases of contemporary use of unclaimed or donated <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> the executed, but they are rarely well documented. The intention of this review is to initiate an ethical discourse about the use <b>of</b> the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> the executed in contemporary anatomy. Clin.
