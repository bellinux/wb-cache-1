5|$|In Scotland, the Saltire can <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> at {{any time}} by any individual, company, local authority, {{hospital}} or school without obtaining express consent. Many local authorities in Scotland fly the Saltire from Council Buildings, however in 2007 Angus Council approved a proposal to replace the Saltire on Council Buildings with a new Angus flag, based on the council's coat of arms. This move led to public outcry across Scotland with more than 7,000 people signing a petition opposing the council's move, leading to a compromise whereby the Angus flag would not replace but <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> alongside the Saltire on council buildings.|$|E

The flag should never <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E
5|$|Another form of airpower {{employed}} by Kenney was air transport. This started in September 1942 when {{troops of the}} 32nd Infantry Division were airlifted from Australia to Port Moresby. Later in the campaign, C-47 Dakotas landed Australian troops at Wanigela. A year later, American paratroops landed at Nadzab, enabling the Australian 7th Division to <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> in.|$|E

When out in the open, the flag should always <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> between sunrise and sunset, irrespective of the weather conditions. Prior to 2009, the flag could <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> on a public building at night under special circumstances; currently, Indian citizens can fly the flag even at night, subject to the restriction that the flag should be hoisted on a tall flagpole and be well-illuminated.|$|E

When lowering the flag from half-mast, it should first be raised to the peak of the pole before it is lowered.|$|E
5|$|A further Scottish {{distinction}} {{from the}} UK flag days {{is that on}} Saint Andrew's Day, (30 November), the Union Flag will only <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> where a building {{has more than one}} flagpole; the Saltire will not be lowered {{to make way for the}} Union Flag where a single flagpole is present. If there are two or more flagpoles present, the Saltire may <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> in addition to the Union Flag but not in a superior position. This distinction arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world where the potential existed for the citizens of a country to be unable to fly their national flag on their country's national day. (In recent years, embassies of the United Kingdom have also flown the Saltire to mark St Andrew's Day). Many bodies of the Scottish Government use the flag as a design basis for their logo; for example, Safer Scotland's emblem depicts a lighthouse shining beams in a saltire shape onto a blue sky. Other Scottish bodies, both private and public, have also used the saltire in similar ways.|$|E
