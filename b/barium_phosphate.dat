An integral {{component of a}} fuel cell and an electrolytic cell is the electrolyte, a material that conducts ions. Liquid electrolytes can be aqueous as in the phosphoric acid and alkaline fuel cells, or molten, as in the molten carbonate fuel cells. A solid electrolyte is preferable because it allows sturdier, more efficient and corrosion resistant systems to be built. The main objective of this work {{is to develop a}} solid electrolyte for hydrogen production by electrolysis of hydrogen sulfide. <b>Barium</b> Hydrogen <b>Phosphate,</b> <b>Barium</b> Dihydrogen <b>Phosphate,</b> Cesium Hydrogen Carbonate, and Ammonium Iodide received brief attention but Cesium Hydrogen Sulfate was the primary candidate considered. Initial investigation has verified that Cesium Hydrogen Sulfate undergoes an impressive first-order phase transition at approximately 140 °C at which the proton conductivity increases by almost four orders of magnitude. An electrochemical cell was designed and developed by Erik Todd for the production of hydrogen. Hydrogen sulfide can electrolyzed into hydrogen and sulfur in an electrochemical cell. Sulfur is in a low viscosity molten state at a temperature of 150 °C. A cell with cesium hydrogen sulfate electrolyte canoperate at this temperature where liquid sulfur and gaseous hydrogen can move out of the cell as they are formed. Consequently, the electrolyte must possess a high conductivity at this temperature to facilitate the migration of hydrogen ions to the negative electrode through the electrolyte. Cesium Hydrogen Sulfate is known to act as an insulator at room temperature and a protonic conductor at 140 °C. Hence it comes as an obvious choice as an electrolyte in a hydrogen sulfide electrochemical cell. The structural and chemical properties of Cesium Hydrogen Sulfate were investigated.  The CsHSOâ electrolyte was prepared by the reaction of cesium carbonate and cesium sulfate with sulfuric acid respectively.  A punch, die and base were designed and fabricated to 0. 52 ̆ 2 and 2. 02 ̆ 2 diameter pellets for that purpose.  X-ray diffraction was performed on the 0. 52 ̆ 2 diameter pellets to identify and characterize the polycrystalline phases of the solid acid electrolyte.  Differential Scanning Calorimetry was performed so as to ascertain the phase transition temperature.  The temperature at which the phase transition occurs was further confirmed by impedance measurements. A test setup was built in order to perform impedance measurements. An experiment to measure the impedance of a 0. 52 ̆ 2 diameter pellet of silver iodide was performed in order to test the validity of the setup.  An infrared analysis was performed on the prepared sample CsHSOâ in order to identify the bond environment of the electrolyte.  Differential scanning calorimetry was performed with <b>Barium</b> Hydrogen <b>Phosphate,</b> <b>Barium</b> Dihydrogen <b>Phosphate,</b> Cesium Hydrogen Carbonate and Ammonium Iodide to identify their phase transition temperatures.  A successful electrolysis of steam experiment was carried out using the CsHSOâ electrolyte to evaluate its performance.  Finally, the CsHSOâ electrolyte was tested in the hydrogen sulfide electrochemical cell for the production of hydrogen and sulfur...|$|R

To this end UCB, solubilized in different micellar bile salt solutions, was incubated with freshly prepared calcium phosphate precipitate. It was demonstrated that amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) rapidly binds and precipitates UCB in a dose-dependent way. The {{results indicate that}} binding of UCB to ACP is specific: binding to <b>barium</b> <b>phosphate</b> was negligible and addition of low amounts of Mg 2 + before formation of the calcium phosphate precipitate (Ca:Mg = 5 : 1) inhibited binding by 80 %. Free Ca 2 + stimulated binding, whereas free phosphate ions inhibited binding of UCB in taurocholate solutions {{and to a lesser}} extent in glycocholate solutions. The apparent affinity of UCB for amorphous calcium phosphate was different in the various bile salt solutions. Binding of UCB decreased at pH > 8. 5 in taurocholate solutions, but not in glycocholate solutions where binding of UCB was constant from pH 7. 5 - 10. 5. We propose a model in which UCB directly binds to amorphous calcium phosphate in the presence of bile salts that weakly interact with ACP, like taurocholate. In the presence of bile salts that strongly interact with ACP, such as glycochenodeoxycholate, binding of UCB may also occur via the bile salt. In conditions of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, such as the Crigler-Najjar syndrome, neonatal jaundice, and in the Gunn rat, considerable amounts of UCB diffuse across the intestinal mucosa.

Analytical simulations of the 137 Ba SSNMR spectra at both fields yield the quadrupolar parameters, and in select cases the barium chemical shift anisotropies (CSAs). Quadrupolar interactions dominate the 137 Ba powder patterns, with quadrupolar coupling constants, CQ (137 Ba), ranging from 7. 0 to 28. 8 MHz. The 137 Ba electric field gradient (EFG) parameters extracted from these spectra are correlated to the local environments at the barium sites, via consideration of molecular symmetry and structure, and first principles calculations of 137 Ba EFG tensors performed using CASTEP software.

30|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, {{nowadays}} more than 60 % of the world acetic acid is produced by the carbonylation of petro-derived methanol [16]. On the other hand, the carbonylation method has a significant drawback due to catalyst solubility limitations {{and the loss of}} expensive Rh metal during the separation section. As an alternative, the biological transformation of lactic acid to acetic acid is well reported. Elferink et al. reported the conversion of lactic acid to acetic acid and 1, 2 -propanediol using Lactobacillus buchneri whereby one mole of lactic acid yielded equimolar amount of acetic acid and 1, 2 -propanediol [17]. Concerning the chemical conversion of lactic acid to acetic acid, the latter is notably reported as a side reaction in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lactic acid to pyruvic acid and dehydration of lactic acid to acrylic acid. For instance, Ai et al. obtained 9.2 % yield in acetic acid form lactic acid using an iron phosphate catalyst doped with molybdenum [18]. The formation of acetic acid (0.7 %) during dehydration of lactic acid was reported by Zhang et al. over NaY zeolite modified by alkali phosphate as a catalyst [19]. Tang et al. reported 1.3 % acetic acid yield over <b>barium</b> <b>phosphate</b> catalysts in the lactic acid dehydration reaction [20]. Peng et al. observed 3.3 % yield in acetic acid as a by-product in the barium sulphate catalysed dehydration of lactic acid [21]. Lingoes have reported the formation of 2 % acetic acid in the lactic acid dehydration using barium based catalysts [22]. Much higher yield in acetic acid by chemo-catalysis were observed by Wang et al. from glucose via lactic acid using copper oxide catalyst (32 %) [23]. Here, we report efficient and highly selective catalysts for the production of acetic acid. In this process, the catalytic oxidation of lactic acid is carried out over a multi-component Mo-V-Nb mixed oxide catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, this simple single-step catalytic process has not yet been reported and would provide a way to produce “green” acetic acid. The Mo-V-Nb is a versatile catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation. This catalyst mostly used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane [24, 25]. The catalytic behaviour of this catalyst also investigated for the ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile [26 - 28]. The catalyst structure and catalytic properties of Mo-V-Nb catalyst also investigated for selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid [29 - 31].

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} spheres as biomaterials {{have been}} attracting attention in recent years. Calcium phosphate occurs naturally in bone, and a hollow structure could be advantageous for drug loading and release. The {{combination of a}} calcium phosphate chemistry and a spherical-hollow structure could be an optimal strategy for specific biomaterial applications, e. g., certain dental and drug-delivery applications. The focus of this thesis is on the synthesis, formation mechanism and applications of hollow, spherical calcium phosphate particles. First, the thesis describes two methods for the synthesis of calcium phosphate (CaP) spherical particles. The first method involves synthesis of hollow calcium phosphate spherical particles via a supersaturated buffer solution based on a previous study. It was utilised to prepare spheres for applications in drug delivery and dentistry. The second method was developed to explain the mechanism of formation of hollow calcium phosphate spheres. It aimed at revealing the particular function of magnesium {{in the formation of}} spherical particles. With the use of this modified method, it could be concluded that the only ions active in the formation of CaP spherical particles are calcium ions, phosphate ions and magnesium ions. Compared with the thermodynamics of micellisation, a new model, called three ions virtual micelle effect, was developed to explain the mechanism of the Mg function. Following this mechanism, a series of spherical particles of other compositions were explored. These spherical particles included strontium phosphate, <b>barium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> calcium fluoride, strontium fluoride and barium fluoride. In this thesis, CaP spheres were studied for the controlled delivery of active ingredients and as active agent for tooth remineralisation. The first investigated application was to control the release of vancomycin from Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) cement via strontium-doped CaP spheres (SCPS). The results showed that incorporation of CaP spheres into PMMA could enhance antibiotic release while maintaining the mechanical strength. The second application was to control hydrogen peroxide (HP) release from two bleaching gel, in which CP-loaded CaP spheres were the active ingredient. One gel with low HP concentration was developed as an at-home bleaching gel, and one with high HP concentration was developed as an in-office bleaching gel. The results showed that CaP spheres would give a controlled release of peroxide and thus have a potential to increase the efficacy of the bleaching. The third application was to investigate the potential for an anti-sensitivity effect of the spheres, as active agents in toothpaste. We studied the tooth tubules occlusion and the remineralisation effect of CaP spheres. After 7 days of application, the open dentin tubules and surface were fully covered by a newly formed apatite layer, demonstrating the remineralisation potential of the spheres...|$|E

Imprinting of glucose <b>phosphate</b> <b>barium</b> salt into a poly(allylamine hydrochloride) network covalently bound to gold surfaces yielded a selective sensor for glucose. Optimization of relative amounts of chemicals used for {{preparation of the}} hydrogel was performed to obtain highest sensitivity. Addition of gold nanoparticles into the hydrogel matrix significantly amplified its response and sensitivity due {{to the impact of}} gold nanoparticles on the refractive index of sensing layer. The detection limit of glucose in deionized water was calculated to be 0. 02 mg/mL, well within the working concentration range suitable for glucose monitoring in diabetic individuals at physiological levels. Evaluation of its selectivity showed that the sensor displayed preferential recognition to glucose compared to structurally related sugars in addition to being unaffected by phosphate as well as compounds containing amine groups, such as creatinine. The developed sensor was finally exposed to human urine spiked with glucose illustrating its ability to selectively re-bind the analyte in complex matrices.

Bulk glasses from two different routes (using P 2 O 5 and H 3 PO 4 as starting materials) presented only one crystallization peak. An assessment of glass-forming ability (GFA) was performed from recent theory that is connected to glass stability (GS), and is also correlated to critical cooling rate, qcr. Systems with high La 2 O 3 content presented some of the highest GS values and estimated critical cooling rates (qcr) lower than 0. 079 K/s. For both routes were determined the activation enthalpies for crystallization, that were 126 12 kJ/mol (for P 2 O 5) and 110 32 kJ/mol (for H 3 PO 4). The calculated Avrami n parameters, based on exothermic crystallization peaks, were 3. 50 0. 33 (for P 2 O 5) and 3. 09 0. 91 (for H 3 PO 4), considering data from the lowest heating rate (5 K/min). These values suggest that the DSC peaks should be associated to volume crystallization, due to La 2 O 3 influence, and crystallization did not change significantly using different routes...|$|R

Full details of this licence are available at: [URL] 2017 The Authors Bulk properties such as glass transition temperature, density and thermal expansion of iron phosphate glass compositions, with replacement of Cs by Ba, are investigated as a surrogate for the transmutation of 137 Cs to 137 Ba, relevant to the immobilisation of Cs in glass. These studies are required to establish the appropriate incorporation rate of 137 Cs in iron phosphate glass. Density and glass transition temperature increases {{with the addition of}} BaO indicating the shrinkage and reticulation of the iron phosphate glass network. The average thermal expansion coefficient reduces from 19. 8 × 10 − 6 K − 1 to 13. 4 × 10 − 6 K − 1, when 25 wt. % of Cs 2 O was replaced by 25 wt. % of BaO in caesium loaded iron phosphate glass. In addition to the above bulk properties, the role of Ba as a network modifier in the structure of iron phosphate glass is examined using various spectroscopic techniques. The Fe II content and average coordination number of iron in the glass network was estimated using Mössbauer spectroscopy.

5000|$|Thermometric titrimetry: Thermometric titrimetry is an {{extraordinarily}} versatile technique. This is differentiated from calorimetric titrimetry {{by the fact}} that the heat of the reaction (as indicated by temperature rise or fall) is not used to determine the amount of analyte in the sample solution. Instead, the equivalence point is determined by the rate of temperature change. Because thermometric titrimetry is a relative technique, it is not necessary to conduct the titration under isothermal conditions, and titrations can be conducted in plastic or even glass vessels, although these vessels are generally enclosed to prevent stray draughts from causing [...] "noise" [...] and disturbing the endpoint. Because thermometric titrations can be conducted under ambient conditions, they are especially well-suited to routine process and quality control in industry. Depending on whether the reaction between the titrant and analyte is exothermic or endothermic, the temperature will either rise or fall during the titration. When all analyte has been consumed by reaction with the titrant, a change in the rate of temperature increase or decrease reveals the equivalence point and an inflection in the temperature curve can be observed. The equivalence point can be located precisely by employing the second derivative of the temperature curve. The software used in modern automated thermometric titration systems employ sophisticated digital smoothing algorithms so that [...] "noise" [...] resulting from the highly sensitive temperature probes does not interfere with the generation of a smooth, symmetrical second derivative [...] "peak" [...] which defines the endpoint. The technique is capable of very high precision, and coefficients of variance (CV's) of less than 0.1 are common. Modern thermometric titration temperature probes consist of a thermistor which forms one arm of a Wheatstone bridge. Coupled to high resolution electronics, the best thermometric titration systems can resolve temperatures to 10−5K. Sharp equivalence points have been obtained in titrations where the temperature change during the titration has been as little as 0.001K. The technique can be applied to essentially any chemical reaction in a fluid where there is an enthalpy change, although reaction kinetics can play a role in determining the sharpness of the endpoint. Thermometric titrimetry has been successfully applied to acid-base, redox, EDTA, and precipitation titrations. Examples of successful precipitation titrations are sulfate by titration with <b>barium</b> ions, <b>phosphate</b> by titration with magnesium in ammoniacal solution, chloride by titration with silver nitrate, nickel by titration with dimethylglyoxime and fluoride by titration with aluminium (as K2NaAlF6) Because the temperature probe does not need to be electrically connected to the solution (as in potentiometric titrations), non-aqueous titrations can be carried out as easily as aqueous titrations. Solutions which are highly colored or turbid can be analyzed by thermometric without further sample treatment. The probe is essentially maintenance-free. Using modern, high precision stepper motor driven burettes, automated thermometric titrations are usually complete in a few minutes, making the technique an ideal choice where high laboratory productivity is required.|$|R
40|$|Water {{quality data}} {{spanning}} 13 years and covering an extensive range of major, minor and trace elements in rain and stream waters at Plynlimon in mid Wales, are presented. Rainfall water chemistry is highly variable due to varying proportions of marine and pollutant derived constituents associated with patterns of atmospheric circulation. Stream waters, being composed of different proportions of waters from three chemically distinct sources {{at any one}} time (atmospheric deposition, the soil system and deeper groundwaters), are also chemically highly variable. For example, components predominantly derived from deposition such as chloride change only in response to sea-salt deposition episodes. Solutes associated with bedrock weathering such as calcium, magnesium, and alkalinity decrease with increasing flow, those associated with the upper soil layers such as aluminium, many transition metals, dissolved organic carbon and hydrogen ions increase with increasing flow. The nutrients (e. g. nitrate, boron, bromide and iodine) exhibit strong seasonal cycles associated with cycles of vegetation growth and decay. The changes in stream water chemistry resulting from tree harvesting in the Afon Hore catchment are shown to have run their course within a period of eight years. Nutrient increases in the first few years following the commencement of felling have returned to or fallen below pre-felling values. Aluminium changes are shown to be complicated by changes in nitrate and calcium. Aluminium concentrations initially increased and have fallen below their pre-felling value. Data for chloride suggest a reduction in capture of dry and mist deposition; this indicates the importance of understanding reduced deposition as a result of felling. Felling has also affected the soil micro-climate which experiences greater fluctuations in temperature and an increase in the concentration of constituents associated with organic matter. Input-output mass balance estimates show that atmospheric inputs of many constituents are retained strongly by the catchment (e. g. ammonium, <b>phosphate,</b> <b>barium,</b> boron, lead and iodine). In contrast, many of the transition elements as well as divalent base cations, aluminium and alkalinity show a net release from the catchment. Conservative constituents such as chloride and sodium show a net input-output balance. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityPrien and Walker^ 39 {{have treated}} chronic kidney stone formers with aspirin. They {{obtained}} clinical evidence showing no new stone growth and inhibition {{of the growth}} of existing stones. The rationale behind such therapy is that aspirin is excreted as a glucuronide conjugate in the urine, and the glucuronide increases dissolution of calcium phosphate stones. Previous laboratory studies^ 39, 10 have shown glucuronides (a concentrate of mixed urinary glucuronides, or o-aminophenol glucuronide) to increase the dissolution of tricalcium phosphate. Tricalcium phosphate is neither a major nor even common component of urinary calculi. The purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate the effect of a glucuronide of salicylates on the dissolution of urinary calculi and their major component compounds. The diffuse pharmacological action of salicylates makes critical, in vitro experiments imperative. The ether glucuronide conjugate of salicylic acid, o-carboxyphenyl-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid (o-CPG), a known metabolic product of salicylates found in urine^ 40 and stones of known composition or synthetic components of stones should be used in these experiments. In the course of this investigation evidence of increased dissolution warranted further experimentation into the possible cause of such effects. Aspirin therapy as initiated by Prien and Walker derived from the qualitative experiments of Neuberg, Mandl and Grauer^ 33, 29, 30. In these experiments the authors attempted to either dissolve calcium salts or to inhibit their precipitation by addition of naturally occurring organic and inorganic acids. They showed that 1 -menthol-Dglucuronic acid solubilizes both calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate salts, that it functions in this way much better than non conjugated glucuronic acid and that incubation of such a mixture with β-glucuronidase leads to precipitation of the salt. The work of Cessi^ 10 followed in which the solubilizing effect of a glucuronide was observed during the synthesis of the glucuronide by an in vitro biological system. p^ 32 in the supernatant fluid resulting from dissolution of a solid phase of tricalcium phosphate containing p^ 32 (placed in the flask with the liver slices) was measured by counting the activity. The increase of p^ 32 over a control flask was found to vary directly with the glucuronide concentration. Salicylates {{have been shown to be}} excreted as the phenolic glucuronide ^ 40, 25, 2. Smith^ 42 has shown that acetylsalicylic acid is probably hydrolyzed in plasma to form salicylic acid. An increase of urinary glucuronides could then be made to occur by the ingestion of various "glucurongenins" (Teague). Prien and Walker^ 39 have reported an increase of 200 - 400 per cent over the basal level of urinary glucuronides in man during a 2 gm dose of aspirin / day. Glucuronides are manufactured largely by the liver, kidney and mucosa of the alimentary tract^ 15, 23, 24. The biosynthesis requires a coenzyme, uridine diphosphate which is thought to react with glucose to produce uridine diphosphoglucose which then may be oxidized to uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid in the presence of DPN^+ 45. The uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid will then transfer the glucuronic acid to a proper acceptor such as a phenol. The role of ingested glucuronic acid in this metabolic scheme seems to be negligible. Only a small percentage is recovered in the urine^ 20. Douglas and King using labeled glucurone found the glucuronic acid in the urine to be labeled in such a way as to support the theory that the glucurone breaks to three-carbon fragments. These fragments probably form a six-carbon precursor of glucuronic acid. Urinary tract calculi have been shown by Prien^ 37 to contain calcium in 90 per cent of 1000 calculi studied. Thirty-three per cent were pure calcium oxalate, 3. 4 per cent pure hydroxy apatite and 34 per cent were mixtures of calcium oxalate and hydroxy apatite. Hydroxy apatite is considered to be the main inorganic component of animal bone. The chemical structure of a unit cell is Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2 ^ 34, 9, 4. This crystal is the most common phosphate crystal found in urinary calculi. It is this component of urinary calculi with which this investigation is mainly concerned. EXPERIMENTAL The first series of experiments were designed to find the effect of o-CPG on the dissolution of a urinary tract stone composed chiefly of hydroxy apatite. The degree of dissolution was followed with phosphate determinations, using the colorometric procedure of Fiske and Subbarow. ^ 21 Since uric acid, salicylic acid, salicyluric acid and o-CPG are all found in the urine in increased amounts following ingestion of salicylates, these compounds were examined for their dissolutive effect. The test flask contained 100 mg of a powdered urinary stone composed mainly of hydroxy apatite, and 0. 1 mMoles of the test compound. The mixture was placed in a small dialysis bag along with 4 - 5 glass beads and 10 ml of buffer. This bag was placed in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 30 ml of the buffer and a few glass beads. Several drops of toluene were added to prevent bacterial contamination. The buffer used was Michaelis universal veronal buffer, pH 7. 8. This pH was chosen because Prien and Walker^ 39 had found it to be optimal for dissolution of calcium phosphate in their early experiments. The o-CPG was synthesized in this laboratory using the method of Lunsford and Murphey. ^ 28 The flasks were placed in a shaking water bath at 38 °C. and aliquots of the external phase in the flasks were analysed at 5 hours and 10 hours. Duplicate flasks were set up for each substance in question and for the control flask which contained hydroxy apatite only. At the end of 5 hours the o-CPG flask showed an increase in the phosphate concentration of 85 per cent over the control. The other substances showed little or no increase. After 10 hours the o-CPG showed an increase of 36 per cent over the control. We conclude that o-CPG increases the dissolution of urinary tract calculi composed mainly of hydroxy apatite. Furthermore, it is suggested from the decreasing per cent of increased dissolution over time that the o-CPG also hastens the equilibrium of dissolution. The experiment was repeated substituting synthetic hydroxy apatite, prepared in this laboratory, for the powdered stone. Estradiol glucuronide was examined as well as o-CPG. After 5. 75 hours both glucuronides increased dissolution; the estradiol glucuronide increased the dissolution by 87 per cent and in this case the o-CPG produced a 555 per cent increase. It can be concluded that o-CPG increases dissolution of hydroxy apatite and that it works better on pure hydroxy apatite than on other forms of calcium and phosphate. Other investigators^ 39, 10 have found an increase of about 40 per cent using calcium phosphate. The first possible explanation for these results, which occurred to us was that o-CPG was complexing calcium ion. In order to determine if complex formation with calcium were taking place, conductometric titrations were performed. The titration curves of sodium hydroxide and of calcium hydroxide with o-CPG, glucuronolactone and salicylic acid, were compared. If the sodium hydroxide titration fits well to the calcium hydroxide titration curve, one concludes that no highly conductive ions are produced and complex formation is absent. The results showed that there is a possibility that a slight amount of complex formation may have occurred with glucuronolactone but certainly not with salicylic acid or o-CPG. Further proof that no complexing of calcium was taking place was obtained by measuring conductivity of separate solutions of calcium lactate and o-CPG at different concentrations. They were then combined, each at one half their original concentration and the resultant conductivity compared with the theoretical conductivity which we calculated. Results show that the combined conductivity is about the same as the theoretical and therefore complex formation is absent. This type of experiment was repeated using calcium chloride instead of calcium lactate and the same results were obtained. The only conclusion we can draw is that o-CPG does not complex calcium. It was thought that perhaps o-CPG complexes calcium and phosphate together. To test this hypothesis another dissolution experiment was designed similar to the first ones reported. However, the o-CPG was incubated in one case with phosphate and in another case with <b>barium</b> and <b>phosphate</b> before being added to the synthetic hydroxy apatite. The only test flask which showed a significant difference from the controls was that one in which o-CPG was incubated first with <b>barium</b> and <b>phosphate.</b> Here, the dissolution effect of o-CPG was decreased by 30 per cent. We conclude that calcium and phosphate may be complexed together by o-CPG. In summary we may state that o-CPG increases the dissolution of urinary tract calculi containing hydroxy apatite; it increases the dissolution of synthetic hydroxy apatite; it does not form a complex with calcium but it may form a complex with calcium and phosphate. The results also suggest that it may increase the dissolution of hydroxy apatite by acting at the surface of the crystal. This question requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} cohesive {{nature of}} micronized poorly water-soluble drug particles often promotes {{the formation of}} drug agglomerates with reduced surface areas for dissolution. The objective of this thesis was to investigate novel and innovative formulation strategies to improve the de-agglomeration behaviour and in vitro dissolution rate of a micronized model poorly water-soluble drug, indomethacin. In the first approach, various micronized poorly water-soluble excipients (including aluminium hydroxide, <b>barium</b> sulphate, calcium <b>phosphate</b> and calcium sulphate) were incorporated into lactose-based indomethacin interactive mixtures. In the second approach, the indomethacin powders were mechanically dry coated (by mechanofusion) with force control agents (such as magnesium and sodium stearate). Mathematical modelling approaches were explored using multi-exponential and mechanism-based models {{in order to gain}} an insight into the de-agglomeration and dissolution mechanisms. Dissolution of the various mixtures and coated powders of indomethacin was conducted with an automated dissolution apparatus (Erweka DT 6, Germany) using the USP paddle method in buffered media at pH 5. 0 under sink conditions. Dissolution data were modelled with multi-exponential equations via the standard-two-stage (STS) estimation method and mechanism-based models were developed by population estimation methods in S-ADAPT. Particle size distributions of the raw materials, interactive mixtures and coated powders were measured by laser diffraction using the Mastersizer S (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK). The dispersion of indomethacin mixtures was measured by laser diffraction in dissolution media under non-sink conditions. The addition of cohesive aluminium hydroxide and calcium phosphate (10 % each) to binary lactose-based interactive mixtures of 10 % indomethacin was found to counter-intuitively and significantly increase the dissolution rate of indomethacin. The improvements in dissolution for these ternary mixtures were unrelated to pH effects but associated with the ability of the poorly water-soluble excipients to facilitate the de-agglomeration of indomethacin agglomerates. Multi-exponential modelling revealed increases in the estimated initial concentration (Cd) and dissolution rate constant (kd) of dispersed indomethacin particles upon addition of the cohesive additives to the binary mixtures. Dissolution of indomethacin was found to increase {{as a function of the}} concentration of aluminium hydroxide (5 - 20 %) added to the binary mixtures. Where three particle size fractions of aluminium hydroxide (with significantly different D 90 sizes) were used, increasing the proportion of larger particles of the aluminium hydroxide increased the dissolution rate of indomethacin. Modelling revealed increases in the kd for the ternary 5 - 20 % aluminium hydroxide mixtures compared with the binary mixture, indicating larger exposed surface areas of dispersed indomethacin particles to the dissolution medium; Cd increased with both the concentration and particle size of the added aluminium hydroxide to the mixtures. Monitoring the extent of particle dispersion over time in dissolution media under non-sink conditions demonstrated an increasing trend in dispersion during the first 12 minutes for the ternary mixtures containing 5 - 15 % aluminium hydroxide; however, no change in the degree of dispersion was observed for the mixture incorporating micronized aluminium hydroxide particles. The underlying mechanisms of dissolution were elucidated and quantified by development of a mechanism-based compartmental model. A series of 5 transit compartments included into the model successfully described the slow initial dissolution rate of the indomethacin mixtures. More importantly, this indicated that agglomerates had inter-converted to dispersed particles; the mean dissolution time of the dispersed particles decreased with the addition of aluminium hydroxide to the binary mixtures. For the ternary mixtures incorporating at least 10 % aluminium hydroxide, the faster dissolution was attributed to lower mean de-agglomeration times and reduced initial concentrations of agglomerates compared with the binary mixture. This supported the hypothesized phenomenon of the role of aluminium hydroxide in enhancing the de-agglomeration of cohesive indomethacin powders. Dry coating micronized powders of indomethacin with magnesium stearate (0. 25, 1, 5 %) and sodium stearate (5 %) by mechanofusion resulted in significantly reduced intrinsic cohesion. Initial increases in the dissolution of indomethacin were found to be dependent on the concentration of magnesium stearate that was mechanofused onto the drug powders; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed a thicker surface coating was achieved with increasing concentrations of the hydrophobic material. The dissolution enhancing effect of the indomethacin powders mechanofused with 5 % sodium stearate was attributed to its surfactant properties that increased the dispersion of indomethacin agglomerates. Initial drug release (during the first 10 minutes of the dissolution study) from the coated powders was able to be described by a matrix-diffusion system in accordance with the Higuchi model. Application of these novel and innovative formulation strategies which demonstrated enhanced dissolution of indomethacin would greatly benefit in the development of poorly water-soluble drug formulations with potentially improved oral bioavailability...|$|R
