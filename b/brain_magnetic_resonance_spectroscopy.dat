40|$|Background: Although comorbid {{substance}} misuse {{is common}} in alcohol dependence, and polysubstance abusers (PSU) represent {{the largest group of}} individuals seeking treatment for drug abuse today, we know little about potential brain abnormalities in this population. <b>Brain</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> studies of mono-substance use disorders (e. g., alcohol or cocaine) reveal abnormal levels of cortical metabolites (reflecting neu ronal integrity, cell membrane turnover/synthesis, cellular bioenergetics, gliosis) and altered concentrations of glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The concurrent misuse of several substances may have unique and different effects on brain biology and function compared to any mono-substance misuse. Methods: High field <b>brain</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> at 4. T and neurocognitive testing were performed at one month of abstinence in 40 alcohol dependent individuals (ALC), 28 alcohol dependent PSU and 16 drug-free controls. Absolute metabolite concentrations were calculated in anterior cingulate (ACC), parieto-occipital (POC) and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC). Results: Compared to ALC, PSU demonstrated significant metabolic abnormalities in the DLPFC and strong trends to lower GABA in the ACC. Metabolite levels in ALC and light drinking controls were statistically equivalent. Within PSU, lower DLPFC GABA levels are related to greater cocaine consumption. Several cortical metabolite concentrations were associated with cognitive performance. Conclusions: While metabolite concentrations in ALC at one month of abstinence were largely normal, PSU showed persistent and functionally significant metabolic abnormalities, primarily in the DLPFC. Our results point to specific metabolic deficits as biomarkers in polysubstance misuse and as targets for pharmacological and behavioral PSU-specific treatment. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Summary Magnetic {{resonance}} spectroscopy {{was used}} to study intracellular pH and compounds which contain phosphorus in normal human brain and primary brain tumours non-invasively. In normal subjects (n= 7) intracellular pH (pHi) of the brain was 7. 03 + 0. 02 (mean±s. e. m.). The pHi did not vary between superficial (2 cm, majority grey matter) and deep brain (5 cm, majority white matter). The relative concentrations of phosphocreatine (PCr) and phosphomonoesters (PME) to ATP were also constant with depth. The relative concentration of phosphodiesters (PDE) increased from superficial to deep in normal brain. The astrocytomas (n = 7, grade II-IV) were significantly more alkaline (pHi = 7. 08 + 0. 03), and contained more PCr and PME, with respect to ATP, than normal brain at similar depth. The meningiomas (n = 4) were also more alkaline (pHi = 7. 19 + 0. 02) with a raised PME level but reduced PCr. The reduction in meningioma PCr {{may be due to}} the significant necrosis (> 20 %) seen in the surgical biopsies. No significant necrosis was seen in the gliomas. Previous in vitro studies suggest that increased PME may be due to accumulation of phosphoethanolamine (PE), a phospholipid precursor.

40|$|Background: Exposure to {{excessive}} manganese (Mn) levels {{is known to}} induce psychiatric and motor disorders including parkinsonian symptoms. Therefore finding a reliable means for early detection of Mn neurotoxicity is desirable. Objectives: Our goal was to study whether in-vivo brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and other brain metabolites in smelters were altered {{as a consequence of}} Mn exposure. Methods: T 1 -weighted MRI was used to visualize Mn deposition in the <b>brain.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (MRS) was used to quantify concentrations of NAA, glutamate and other brain metabolites in globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, and frontal cortex from a well-established cohort of 10 male Mn-exposed smelters and 10 male age-matched control subjects. The MEGA-PRESS MRS sequence was used to determine GABA levels in a region encompassing the thalamus and adjacent parts of the basal ganglia ("GABA-VOI"). Results: Seven out of ten exposed subjects showed clear T 1 -hyperintense signals in the globus pallidus indicating Mn accumulation. We found a significant increase (82 %; p= 0. 014) of GABA/tCr in the GABA-VOI of Mn-exposed subjects, as well as a distinct decrease (9 %, p= 0. 04) of NAA/tCr in frontal cortex that strongly correlated (R= - 0. 93, p< 0. 001) with cumulative Mn exposure. Conclusions: We demonstrated elevated GABA levels in the thalamus and adjacent basal ganglia and decreased frontal cortex NAA levels, indicating neuronal dysfunction in a brain area not primarily targeted by Mn. Therefore, the non-invasive in vivo MRS measurement of GABA and NAA may prove to be a powerful tool for detecting presymptomatic effects of Mn neurotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Mounting {{evidence}} links {{neurodegenerative disorders}} such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease with mitochondrial dysfunction, and recent emphasis has focused on mitochondrial dynamics and quality control. Mitochondrial dynamics and mtDNA maintenance is another link recently emerged, implicating mutations in the mitochondrial fusion genes OPA 1 and MFN 2 in the pathogenesis of multisystem syndromes characterized by neurodegeneration and accumulation of mtDNA multiple deletions in postmitotic tissues. Here, we report 2 Italian families affected by dominant chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) complicated by parkinsonism and dementia. METHODS: Patients were extensively studied by optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess retinal nerve fibers, and underwent muscle and <b>brain</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (MRS), and muscle biopsy and fibroblasts were analyzed. Candidate genes were sequenced, and mtDNA was analyzed for rearrangements. RESULTS: Affected individuals displayed a slowly progressive syndrome characterized by CPEO, mitochondrial myopathy, sensorineural deafness, peripheral neuropathy, parkinsonism, and/or cognitive impairment, in most cases without visual complains, but with subclinical loss of retinal nerve fibers at OCT. Muscle biopsies showed cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers and mtDNA multiple deletions, and MRS displayed defective oxidative metabolism in muscle and brain. We found 2 heterozygous OPA 1 missense mutations affecting highly conserved amino acid positions (p. G 488 R, p. A 495 V) in the guanosine triphosphatase domain, each segregating with affected individuals. Fibroblast studies showed a reduced amount of OPA 1 protein with normal mRNA expression, fragmented mitochondria, impaired bioenergetics, increased autophagy and mitophagy. INTERPRETATION: The association of CPEO and parkinsonism/dementia with subclinical optic neuropathy widens the phenotypic spectrum of OPA 1 mutations, highlighting the association of defective mitochondrial dynamics, mtDNA multiple deletions, and altered mitophagy with parkinsonism...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Brain</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (MRS) {{has been}} {{reported}} to be a valuable noninvasive tool in the diagnosis of some rare diseases. In this study, our aim was to assess lactate peak on single-voxel proton MRS in children with syndromic mitochondria! diseases (MDs). Methods: From March 2004 to November 2010, 14 patients who were diagnosed with syndromic MDs underwent single-voxel proton MRS examination. The volume of interest was positioned on axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and voxels were sampled using short (35 milliseconds), intermediate (144 milliseconds), or long (288 milliseconds) echo times for determination of lactate at 1. 33 parts/million. Results: Twelve of fourteen patients (85. 7 %) exhibited lactate peaks on the initial single-voxel proton MRS, and all of them showed abnormal MRI findings. The correlations of lactate level in blood and lactate peak on single-voxel proton MRS were inconsistent. Among the 12 patients, eight (66. 7 %) had corresponding elevated levels of blood lactate, and four (33. 3 %) had normal levels of blood lactate. Compared with a positive rate of 85. 7 % for patients with lactate peaks on the single-voxel proton MRS, the positive rates for diagnosing syndromic MDs by using electron microscopic examination of muscle biopsy, oral glucose lactate stimulation test, and blood lactate level were 100 %, 91. 7 %, and 71. 4 %, respectively. Conclusion: Lactate acquisition on single-voxel proton MRS provides a noninvasive and complementary tool for the diagnosis of syndromic MDs, especially in children with abnormal signal changes on the brain MRI or a normal blood lactate level.

40|$|Leigh syndrome, {{caused by}} {{dysfunction}} in mitochondrial energy metabolism, is an inherited, heterogeneous, and progressive neurodegenerative disorder of infancy and childhood. From 1983 to August 2006, 14 cases diagnosed with Leigh syndrome were studied {{in terms of}} characteristic neuroimaging findings and abnormal mitochondrial configurations under electron microscopy, as well as molecular analysis. Of the 14 cases, 11 presented clinical features before age 1. (79 %). All 14 presented with variable symptoms of central nervous system involvement. The three most common symptoms were developmental delay (12 / 14; 86 %), seizures (11 / 14; 79 %), and altered consciousness (8 / 14; 57 %). Extra-central nervous system manifestations were observed in 10 of the 14 cases, the most common symptoms being failure to thrive (5 / 14; 36 %), pericardial effusion and dilated cardiomyopathy (3 / 14; 21 %), and liver function impairment (3 / 14; 21 %). In all 14 cases, neuroimaging revealed abnormal findings over the basal ganglion, brainstem, or both. The putamen {{was the most common}} lesion site in the basal ganglia (11 / 12; 92 %). Cranial <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging was used for follow-up in 6 cases because of changes in clinical features; in all 6 cases the imaging revealed evolution in the <b>brain.</b> Cranial <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> was performed in 3 cases and in 2 of them revealed lactate peaks during deterioration of the disease course. The prognosis for Leigh syndrome was poor during long-term follow-up. Seven cases were early fatalities, before 1 year and 6 months of age. Follow-up cranial <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging together with <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> in cases with clinical evolution is helpful for monitoring this disease.

40|$|Seizures and {{neurologic}} involvement {{have been}} reported in patients infected with Shiga toxin (Stx) producing E. coli, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) with neurologic involvement is associated with more severe outcome. We investigated the extent of renal and neurologic damage in mice following injection of the highly potent form of Stx, Stx 2 a, and less potent Stx 1. As observed in previous studies, Stx 2 a brought about moderate to acute tubular necrosis of proximal and distal tubules in the kidneys. Brain sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) appeared normal, although some red blood cell congestion was observed. Microglial cell responses to neural injury include up-regulation of surface-marker expression (e. g. Iba 1) and stereotypical morphological changes. Mice injected with Stx 2 a showed increased Iba 1 staining, mild morphological changes associated with microglial activation (thickening of processes), and increased microglial staining per unit area. Microglial changes were observed in the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala regions, but not the nucleus. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging (MRI) of Stx 2 a-treated mice revealed no hyper-intensities in the <b>brain,</b> although <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (MRS) revealed significantly decreased levels of phosphocreatine in the thalamus. Less dramatic changes were observed following Stx 1 challenge. Neither immortalized microvascular endothelial cells from the cerebral cortex of mice (bEnd. 3) nor primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells were found to be susceptible to Stx 1 or Stx 2 a. The lack of susceptibility to Stx for both cell types correlated with an absence of receptor expression. These studies indicate Stx causes subtle, but identifiable changes in the mouse brain...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{with type}} 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 1 DM) experience, on average, 2 to 3 hypoglycemic episodes per week. This study investigated the effect of hypoglycemia on cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with uncomplicated T 1 DM. For this purpose, hyperinsulinemic euglycemic and hypoglycemic glucose clamps were performed on separate days, using [1 - 13 C]glucose infusion to increase plasma 13 C enrichment. In vivo <b>brain</b> 13 C <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> {{was used to measure}} the time course of 13 C label incorporation into different metabolites and to calculate the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux (VTCA) by a one-compartment metabolic model. We found that cerebral glucose metabolism, as reflected by the VTCA, was not significantly different comparing euglycemic and hypoglycemic conditions in patients with T 1 DM. However, the VTCA was inversely related to the HbA 1 C and was, under hypoglycemic conditions, approximately 45 % higher than that in a previously investigated group of healthy subjects. These data suggest that the brains of patients with T 1 DM are better able to endure moderate hypoglycemia than those of subjects without diabetes...|$|R
