5|$|However, the boar and its {{relative}} the pig started <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> as polluting since the 12th century, due to Muslim influence on India. Muslims consider the pig and its meat unclean. This {{led to a}} decline in Varaha worship to a certain extent.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} safety, it is best practice to have 360° coverage with the active warnings, improving the chance of the vehicle <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> from all sides. In some countries, such as the United States, this may be mandatory.|$|E

5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not <b>being</b> <b>seen,</b> since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|Many {{habitats}} in {{the monument}} support populations of snakes and lizards. Southern alligator and western fence lizards are common; others that live here include short-horned and common side-blotched lizards and western skinks. Garter and gopher snakes and western yellow-bellied racers frequent floodplains and canyon bottoms. Rattlesnakes, though venomous, are shy and usually flee before <b>being</b> <b>seen.</b> The springs and seeps {{in the park}} contain isolated populations of western toads, American spadefoot toads, Pacific tree frogs, and long-toed salamanders.|$|E

5000|$|The First Ecumenical Council was convened {{to address}} the divinity of Christ once more (see Paul of Samosata and the Synods of Antioch) but this time through the teachings of Arius, an Egyptian presbyter from Alexandria, who taught that Jesus Christ was created, albeit divine, and not God in essence: both the Father and the Son where of [...] "like" [...] essence or <b>being</b> (<b>see</b> homoiousia) but not of the same essence or <b>being</b> (<b>see</b> homoousia). Much of the controversion was over the kenotic phrasing that Christ {{expressed}} in the New Testament to express submission to God the Father. This Ecumenical council declared that Jesus Christ was a distinct from God in existence (hypostasis or persona). Jesus was God in essence, being and nature (ousia or substantia).|$|R
5|$|Some modern {{scholars}} have accepted these numbers, {{especially since the}} ancient sources are unusually consistent on this point. Other authors reject this number, with 1,207 <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> {{as more of a}} reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was therefore spurred {{in part by a}} desire to form a stronger political current, rather than <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> as the communist opposition to the Comintern and the Soviet Union. Trotsky believed that its formation was all the more urgent for the role he saw it playing in the impending World War.|$|E

5000|$|The {{focus of}} the Council of Nicaea {{was the nature of}} the Son of God and his precise {{relationship}} to God the Father. (see Paul of Samosata and the Synods of Antioch). Arius taught that Jesus Christ was divine/holy and was sent to earth for the salvation of mankind but that Jesus Christ was not equal to God the Father (infinite, primordial origin) in rank and that God the Father and the Son of God were not equal to the Holy Spirit (power of God the Father). Under Arianism, Christ was instead not consubstantial with God the Father since both the Father and the Son under Arius were made of [...] "like" [...] essence or <b>being</b> (<b>see</b> homoiousia) but not of the same essence or <b>being</b> (<b>see</b> homoousia).|$|R
5|$|The tor {{and other}} sites in Glastonbury {{have also been}} {{significant}} in Goddess worship, with the flow from the Chalice Well representing menstrual flow and the tor <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> as either a breast or the whole figure of the Goddess. This has been celebrated with an effigy of the Goddess leading an annual procession up the Tor.|$|E
5|$|General praise went to {{the variety}} of choice in its {{narrative}} and gameplay, despite the former <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> as lacking in places and the latter being held back by other {{factors such as the}} limitations of the Biomod upgrade system and its limited environment sizes. Poor AI behavior was also a recurring criticism. The Xbox version was praised for its performance and graphics despite several reviewers noting distracting drops in frame rate and other technical issues. The PC version was frequently criticized as having similar frame rate issues in addition to problems with the controls, the necessity for a powerful computer to run the game properly, {{and the fact that the}} game was scaled down to run on the Xbox.|$|E
5|$|Henry is of Antillean heritage: his father, Antoine, is from Guadeloupe (La Désirade island), and his mother, Maryse, is from Martinique. He {{was born}} and raised in Les Ulis suburb of Paris which, despite {{sometimes}} <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> as a tough neighbourhood, provided good footballing facilities. As a seven-year-old, Henry showed great potential, prompting Claude Chezelle to recruit him to the local club CO Les Ulis. His father pressured him to attend training, although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football. He joined US Palaiseau in 1989, but after a year his father fell out with the club, so Henry moved to ES Viry-Châtillon and played there for two years. US Palaiseau coach Jean-Marie Panza, Henry's future mentor, followed him there.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have also}} {{adversely}} impacted {{the ecology of}} the Everglades by introducing numerous invasive species, which may prey on or compete with native species. A spectacular and particularly damaging example of this phenomenon is the recent proliferation of the Burmese python in the Everglades, as well as elsewhere in Florida. First observed in the wild in 1979 and not again until 1995, they have increased alarmingly since 2000. By 2011, decreases of 87.5%, 94.1%, 98.9% and 99.3% in sightings of bobcats, white-tailed deer, opossums and raccoons, respectively, were reported in park road surveys, while rabbits were no longer <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> at all.|$|E
5|$|In a new {{affidavit}} (his second affidavit {{and third}} statement), Conley admitted he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank. He {{said he had}} met Frank on the street on Saturday, and was told to follow him to the factory. Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told {{him to leave the}} factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.|$|E

Obama gained ground in {{national}} polling {{in the next few}} days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary. Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, defeating Obama narrowly. It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.|$|E
