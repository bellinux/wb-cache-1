40|$|Char is a low-value <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> {{gasification}} and pyrolysis {{with many}} potential applications, such as soil amendment and {{the synthesis of}} activated carbon and carbon-based catalysts. Considering these high-value applications, char could provide economic benefits to a biorefinery utilizing gasification or pyrolysis technologies. However, the properties of char depend heavily on biomass feedstock, gasifier design and operating conditions. This paper reports the effects of biomass type (switchgrass, sorghum straw and red cedar) and equivalence ratio (0. 20, 0. 25 and 0. 28), i. e., the ratio of air supply relative to the air that is required for stoichiometric combustion of biomass, on the physiochemical properties of char derived from gasification. Results show that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas {{of most of the}} char were 1 – 10 m 2 /g and increased as the equivalence ratio increased. Char moisture and fixed carbon contents decreased while ash content increased as equivalence ratio increased. The corresponding Fourier Transform Infrared spectra showed that the surface functional groups of char differed between biomass types but remained similar with change in equivalence ratio...|$|E
40|$|Ethylbenzene {{has been}} {{identified}} in at least 829 of the 1, 689 hazardous waste sites that have been proposed for inclusion on the EPA National Priorities List (NPL) (HazDat 2007). However, the number of sites evaluated for ethylbenzene is not known. The frequency of these sites {{can be seen in}} Figure 6 - 1. Of these sites, 825 are located within the United States, 2 are located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and 2 are located in the Virgin Islands (not shown). Ethylbenzene is an aromatic hydrocarbon naturally present in crude petroleum. It is also a combustion <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomass.</b> It is widely distributed in the environment because of human activities {{such as the use of}} fuels and solvents (which account for the bulk of emissions) and through chemical manufacturing and production activities. Because of its volatile nature, ethylbenzene tends to partition to the atmosphere when it is released to the environment; therefore, exposure to this chemical is most likely to occur by inhalation. However, it is also present in trace amounts in some water supplies and food items. Thus, ingestion also may be an important exposure pathway in some cases. Exposures from contaminated water may also occur via inhalation and dermal absorption during showering and other household activities (Beavers et al. 1996). Physical, chemical, and biological processes can remove ethylbenzene from the medium of concern an...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} approach for biomass upgrading to fuels requires catalyst synthesis, characterization, and kinetic evaluation. The work was divided in three areas, 1 -preparation and characterization of model catalysts containing metal oxide overcoats and metal nanoparticles synthesized by {{atomic layer deposition}} (ALD), a gas-phase material deposition technique, 2 -the study of structure sensitivity for formic acid decomposition on planar Pt catalysts, and 3 -characterization of bimetallic Pt-M (M = Re, Mo) catalysts using surface sensitive techniques and theory. ^ In the first project, metal oxide overcoats, which {{have been found to}} prevent metal nanoparticle deactivation via sintering and coking in biomass upgrading reactions, were prepared by ALD. In this work, model alumina-overcoated catalysts were synthesized by exposing Pd(111), Pt(111), and Cu(111) surfaces to trimethylaluminum at ca. 10 - 6 mbar and a co-reactant (H 2 O or O 2) at ca. 10 - 6 or 0. 1 mbar. Nominal Al coverages differed on each surface after saturation trimethylaluminum exposure (≥ 500 L) at 200 °C in the order Pd(111) (1. 4 ML) 3 ̆e Pt(111) (1. 0 ML) 3 ̆e Cu(111) (no Al), and Al alloyed only with Pd(111). Trimethylaluminum adsorbed on Cu 2 O-covered Cu(111), consuming adsorbed oxygen. Overlayer morphologies and adsorbed carbon species were found to be different on each surface, indicating that the interaction of trimethylaluminum with transition metal surfaces is substrate-dependent. Details of each reaction mechanism are discussed. Atomic layer deposition was also used for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles. Dissociative adsorption sites for M(II) (M = Pd or Cu) hexafluoroacetylacetonates (hfac) on rutile TiO 2 (110) to form adsorbed (hfac) and M(hfac) were determined, and annealing this surface resulted in the formation of M nanoparticles. ^ In the second project, formic acid decomposition kinetics were evaluated on planar Pt catalysts. Hydrogen is necessary for oxygen removal from biomass, and formic acid, a <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> upgrading, catalytically decomposes to produce H 2 and CO 2 or H 2 O and CO. Batch reactor kinetics were found to be structure-insensitive on Pt(111), (100), and a polycrystalline foil under standard reaction conditions (1...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{sustainable}} alternative fuels is ever-increasing {{in the power}} generation, transportation, and energy sectors due to the inherent non-sustainable characteristics and political constraints of current energy resources. A number of alternative fuels derived from cellulosic biomass, algae, or waste are being considered, along with the conversion of electricity to non-carbon fuels such as hydrogen or ammonia (NH 3). The latter is receiving attention recently {{because it is a}} non-carbon fuel that is readily produced in large quantities, stored and transported with current infrastructure, and is often a <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> or waste conversion processes. However, pure or anhydrous ammonia combustion is severely challenging due to its high auto-ignition temperature (650 2 ̆ 6 degC), low reactivity, and tendency to promote NOx formation. As such, the present study focuses on two major aspects of the ammonia combustion. The first is an applied investigation of the potential to achieve pure NH 3 combustion with low levels of emissions in flames of practical interest. In this study, a swirl-stabilized flame typically used in fuel-oil home-heating systems is optimized for NH 3 combustion, and measurements of NO and NH 3 are collected {{for a wide range of}} operating conditions. The second major focus of this work is on fundamental investigation of NOx formation mechanisms in flames with high levels of NH 3 in H 2. For laminar premixed and diffusion jet flames, experimental measurements of flame speeds, exhaust-gas sampling, and in-situ NO measurements (NO PLIF) are compared with numerically predicted flames using complex chemical kinetics within CHEMKIN and reacting CFD codes i. e., UNICORN. From the preliminary testing of the NOx formation mechanisms, (1) Tian (2) Konnov and (3) GRI-Mech 3. 0 in laminar premixed H 2 /NH 3 flames, the Tian and Konnov mechanisms are found to capture the reduction in measured flame speeds with increasing NH 3 in the fuel mixture, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The NOx predictions by all the three chemical mechanisms are observed to be in fairly good agreement with the measured NOx, qualitatively, however predictions are found to be 3 to 4 times higher than the measurements for both lean and rich H 2 /NH 3 premixed flames. For laminar H 2 /NH 3 diffusion flames, detailed 2 -D comparisons of in-situ NO measurements with the 2 -D simulated NO using the Tian, GRI-Mech 3. 0 and modified GRI-Mech chemical mechanisms are performed and found to differ from the measured NO by approximately an order of magnitude. For NH 3 seeded H 2 /air diffusion flames, GRI-Mech 3. 0 seemed to overpredict NO by more than an order of magnitude and failed to capture the fundamental flame characteristics, such as the flame length variation with increasing NH 3 in the fuel mixture. On the other hand, the predicted NO profiles by the Tian mechanism were not only found to be in better agreement with the measured NO, but they also captured the in-flame NO distribution as well, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Overall, the Tian mechanism is found to be the superior chemical mechanism to capture the NOx formation chemistry in NH 3 seeded flames...|$|E
40|$|A {{high level}} of {{robustness}} against gene deletion is observed in many organisms. However, {{it is still not}} clear which biochemical features underline this robustness and how these are acquired during evolution. One hypothesis, specific to metabolic networks, is that robustness emerges as a <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> selection for <b>biomass</b> production in different environments. To test this hypothesis we performed evolutionary simulations of metabolic networks under stable and fluctuating environments. We find that networks evolved under the latter scenario can better tolerate single gene deletion in specific environments. Such robustness is underlined by an increased number of independent fluxes and multifunctional enzymes in the evolved networks. Observed robustness in networks evolved under fluctuating environments was "apparent," {{in the sense that it}} decreased significantly as we tested effects of gene deletions under all environments experienced during evolution. Furthermore, when we continued evolution of these networks under a stable environment, we found that any robustness they had acquired was completely lost. These findings provide evidence that evolution under fluctuating environments can account for the observed robustness in metabolic networks. Further, they suggest that organisms living under stable environments should display lower robustness in their metabolic networks, and that robustness should decrease upon switching to more stable environments...|$|R

40|$|Global warming {{induced by}} {{increasing}} concentrations {{of greenhouse gases}} in the atmosphere has become today an important environmental concern. A worldwide problem has become the depletion of petrochemical fuels and the continuous rise in oil prize that call us to make a global effort {{in order to find}} alternative energetic sources. A gradual replacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy sources (i. e. biofuels) is needed. In this scenario the use of microalgae {{can be seen as a}} possible solution to the problem of global warming since this group of fast-growing unicellular organisms shows several advantages (widespread availability, absent competition with agricultural land, utilization of cheap and abundant nutrient sources, high oil and biomass yields, high quality <b>of</b> the <b>byproducts,</b> generation <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> for biofuel production with concomitant CO 2 sequestration and suitability for wastewater treatments and other industrial plants) which make them one of the most promising and attractive renewable sources for a fully sustainable and lowcarbon economy portfolio. Despite this growing interest, the current microalgae-based technology is still not widespread since it is affected by technical and economic constraints that hinder its full scale-up. Therefore, great R&D efforts are currently undertaken to produce biodiesel at competitive costs and with the required quality starting from microalgae feedstock. In particular given the potential benefits of microalgae, their cultivation should be studied and optimized to make them competitive as fuel producing systems in the global market. Coherently to the scenario above reported, this work is focused on the investigation of two microalgae strains, Nannochloris eucaryotum and Chorella vulgaris. In particular, growth kinetics of these strains are investigated by taking into consideration the effect of medium composition and gas concentration using batch and fed-batch photobioreactors. The aim of this characterization is thus to gain useful information for the cultivation of microalgae in order to optimize the viable production of biofuels and high value-added products at the industrial scale by means of a process which uses flue gases as CO 2...|$|R
