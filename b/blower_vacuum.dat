40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the modelling of gear rattle in Roots <b>blower</b> <b>vacuum</b> pumps. Analysis of experimental data reveals that the source of the noise and vibration problem is the backlash nonlinearity due to gear teeth losing and re-establishing contact. We develop nonsmooth ordinary differential equation models for the dynamics of the pump. The models include a time-dependent forcing term which arises from the imperfect, eccentric mounting of the gears. We use a combination of explicit construction, asymptotic methods and numerical techniques to classify complicated dynamic behaviour in realistic parametric regimes. We first present a linear analysis of motions where the gears do not lose contact, and develop upper bounds on eccentricity for quiet operation. We then develop a nonlinear analysis of ‘backlash oscillations’, where the gears lose and re-establish contact, corresponding to noisy pump operation. It is found that noisy solutions can coexist with silent ones, explaining why geared systems can rattle intermittently. We then consider several possible design solutions, and show their implications for pump design in terms of the existence and stability of silent and noisy solutions. Finally, we present conclusions and possibilities for future work...|$|E

40|$|Emission {{factors and}} {{emissions}} estimates are subject both to variability and uncertainty. Variability refers to real differences in emissions among multiple emission sources {{at any given}} time or over time for any individual emission source. Variability in emissions can be attributed to variation in: fuel or feedstock composition; ambient temperature; process design; process maintenance; and/or process operation. Uncertainty refers to lack of knowledge regarding the true value of emissions. Sources of uncertainty include: small sample sizes; lack of precision and/or accuracy in measurements; non-representativeness; or lack of data. In this paper, we demonstrate quantitative methods for characterizing both variability and uncertainty and apply the methods to case studies of emission factors for lawn and garden engines. Lawn and Garden engines, which are primarily 2 -stroke and 4 -stroke gasoline engines of less than 25 hp, are used in a variety of applications including walk behind mowers, lawn tractors, shredders, grinders, <b>blowers,</b> <b>vacuums,</b> string trimmers, chainsaws, hedge trimmers, and others. Data were obtained from emissions testing conducted by others and were analyzed to quantify both variability and uncertainty. The variability in emissions was quantified using empirical and parametric distributions. Bootstrap simulation was used to characterize confidence intervals for the fitted distributions. The 95 percent confidence intervals for the mean emission factors associated with 2 S total hydrocarbon (THC) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions in g/hp-hr units were- 32 % to + 38 % and- 46 % to + 65 %, respectively.

Composting mixtures may be piled on concrete pads with built-in air ducts to be covered by a layer of unmixed bulking agents. Odors may be minimized by using an aerating <b>blower</b> drawing <b>vacuum</b> through the composting pile via the underlying ducts and exhausting through a filtering pile of previously composted sludge to be replaced when moisture content reaches 70 percent.

50|$|The soil vapor {{extraction}} remediation technology uses <b>vacuum</b> <b>blowers</b> and extraction wells {{to induce}} gas {{flow through the}} subsurface, collecting contaminated soil vapor, which is subsequently treated aboveground. SVE systems can rely on gas inflow through natural routes or specific wells may be installed for gas inflow (forced or natural). The vacuum extraction of soil gas induces gas flow across a site, increasing the mass transfer driving force from aqueous (soil moisture), non-aqueous (pure phase), and solid (soil) phase into the gas phase. Air flow across a site is thus a key aspect, but soil moisture and subsurface heterogeneity (i.e., a mixture of low and high permeability materials) can result in less gas flow across some zones. In some situations, such as enhancement of monitored natural attenuation, a passive SVE system that relies on barometric pumping may be employed.|$|R

A cooldown {{of the pressure}} vessel with liquid nitrogen was performed on Sept. 26 to check the vessel's integrity. With the pressure vessel cold, the insulating vacuum was monitored for leaks. Through out the testing, the insulating vacuum remained good and the vessel passed the test. The cold test was carried out per the procedures of D-Zero engineering note 3740. 220 -EN- 250. The test was {{very similar to the}} cold test performed on the Central Calorimeter in October of 1987. The test of the ECS was performed in the same manner using the same equipment as the ECN cold test. Reference D-Zero engineering notes 3740. 210 -EN- 122, 3740. 000 -EN-I 07, and 3740. 210 -EN-II 0 for information about the CC cold test. Reference EN- 260 for the results of the ECN cold test. The insulating vacuum space was pumped on while equipment was being connected to the pressure vessel. Two hours after starting to pump with the <b>blower</b> the <b>vacuum</b> space pressure was at about 40 microns. The pumping continued overnight (another 16 hours). In the morning the pressure was 11. 5 microns. A rate of rise test was performed. With the pump valved off, the pressure rose to 14 microns within 5 minutes and then rose to 16 microns in 6 hours (0. 33 microns/hour). After all connections were made to the pressure vessel, a vacuum pump with an estimated effective pumping speed of about 70 scfm was valved on. After 18 hours, the pressure vessel was down to 270 microns. An additional day of pumping took the pressure down to only 250 microns. A leak was then found and fixed around the seal of the rupture disc. The pump was put on line again. The pressure vessel with pump on line was 27 microns after 16. 5 hours. A rate of rise was then conducted. The pressure was 90 microns after valving out the pump. After 30 minutes the pressure increased to 107 microns. (34 microns/hr) ...|$|R
40|$|The duct of a {{robot vacuum}} cleaner is {{the length of the}} flow channel between the inlet of the rolling brush blower and the outlet of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>blower.</b> To cope with the {{pressure}} drop problem of the duct flow field in a {{robot vacuum cleaner}}, a method based on Pressure Implicit with Splitting of Operators (PRISO) algorithm is introduced and the optimisation design of the duct flow field is implemented. Firstly, the duct structure in a robot vacuum cleaner is taken as a research object, with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) theories adopted; a three&# 8208;dimensional fluid model of the duct is established by means of the FLUENT solver of the CFD software. Secondly, with the k&# 8208;&# 949; turbulence model of three&# 8208; dimensional incompressible fluid considered and the PRISO pressure modification algorithm employed, the flow field numerical simulations inside the duct of the robot vacuum cleaner are carried out. Then, the velocity vector plots on the arbitrary plane of the duct flow field are obtained. Finally, an investigation of the dynamic characteristics of the duct flow field is done and defects of the original duct flow field are analysed, the optimisation of the original flow field has then been conducted. Experimental results show that the duct flow field after optimisation can effectively reduce pressure drop, the feasibility as well as the correctness of the theoretical modelling and optimisation approaches are validated...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the results and lesson learned from several two-phase extraction tests and system operations data from the last three years. The paper provides an outline for the proprietary and non-proprietary two-phase extraction methods, designing and implementing effective pilot tests, performance monitoring, and design considerations for volatile hydrocarbons stripping and minimizing the friction losses. Two-phase extraction is an effective method for the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated with volatile hydrocarbons. Two-phase extraction removes both groundwater and soil vapor in a common stream while enhancing biodegradation of the hydrocarbons in the vadose and the saturated zone. The method should be used after serious consideration for the water lifting mechanism of the vacuum, and the friction losses due to handling large volume of water. In most applications, a conventional <b>vacuum</b> <b>blower</b> system with a carefully designed knockout and piping system can perform {{as well as a}} liquid ring pump system. The success of two-phase extraction depends on the ability of the piping design to deliver maximum vacuum to the wellhead with minimal friction loss in the extraction pipe. One major challenge is to lift the water in the well from depths greater than 33 feet. There are several proprietary and non-proprietary methods available presenting their own challenges and benefits. Another major challenge is to measure the vapor flow at the individual wellhead when extracting from more than one well. A flow splitter was developed to overcome the difficulty of measuring flow of water and vapor separately. Two-phase extraction strips volatile compounds from the groundwater with stripping efficiency up to 99 % for BTEX and/or MTBE observed during two full-scale system operations and over seven pilot tests...|$|R
40|$|The North endcap {{calorimeter}} {{vessel was}} recieved on July 1, 1990. A cooldown {{of the pressure}} vessel with liquid nitrogen was performed on July 10 - 11 to check the vessel's integrity. With the pressure vessel cold, the insulating vacuum was monitored for leaks. Through out the testing, the insulating vacuum remained good and the vessel passed the test. The cold test was carried out per the procedures of D-Zero engineering note 3740. 220 -EN- 250. The test was {{very similar to the}} cold test performed on the Central Calorimeter in October of 1987. Reference D-Zero engineering notes 3740. 210 -EN- 122, 3740. 000 -EN 107, and 3740. 210 -EN- 110 for information about the CC cold test. The insulating vacuum space was pumped on while equipment was being connected to the pressure vessel. Two hours after starting to pump with the <b>blower</b> the <b>vacuum</b> space pressure was at about 210 microns. Pumping on the vacuum space for the next 15 hours showed no progress and a leak detector was connected to the pumping line. A leak check showed a leak in a thermocouple feedthru on the vacuum space relief plate. After fixing the leak, the pressure dropped to 16 microns in less than one hour. A rate of rise test was performed starting at a pressure of 13 microns. The pressure rose to 39 microns within 8 minutes and then only rose to 43 microns in 2. 5 hours (1. 6 microns/hour). After all connections were made to the pressure vessel, a vacuum pump with an estimated effective pumping speed of about 70 scfm was valved on. The lowest pressure achieved after 2 days of pumping was 80 microns. Valving out the pump for 30 minutes resulted in a 5 micron per minute rate of rise. The rate of rise was considered acceptable since there were known leak paths through the bolts of the signal ports. The EC North vessel was rolled outside of Lab A in preparation for a 5000 gallon liquid nitrogen trailer which arrived July, 10 at 8 : 00 am. Before filling the vessel, the vacuum space pump was valved off. The pressure in the vacuum space was 12 microns at that point. During the next 24 hours of the test, the vacuum space pressure decreased to 5 microns. A plot of the vacuum space pressure with time is included {{at the end of this}} note. The liquid nitrogen was pressure transferred from the trailer at 29 psig to the pressure vessel at 1 psig for ten hours. At that time there was sufficient (16 -inch) of liquid nitrogen in the vessel to turn the LN 2 trailer delivery pump on. Thirteen and one half hours after starting the fill, the vessel had 50 -inch of LN 2 collected. During the latter part of the filling, about twelve loud metallic bangs were heard. The noises came at random intervals with sometimes five minutes between and other times an hour between. The best way to describe the sound is to imagine the sound made if someone was trapped inside the vessel with a baseball bat and took a good swing. The trailer was disconnected and the the vessel was left overnight for ten hours. Due to the slow LN 2 fill rate, the temperature gradient in the pressure vessel shell was not very large, only about 25 kelvin difference was found from a RTD in the warm-up nozzle of the vessel and the resistors of the liquid level probe. A temperature versus time graph is included at the end of this note...|$|R

This note concerns {{the testing of}} this generator. A list of loads is attached to this note. One of the loads on the emergency power grid is a 10 KVA Uninterruptable Power Supply(UPS). The UPS powers the cryogenic controls and Oxygen deficiency hazard equipment(ODH) and has a minimum rating of 20 minutes while on its batteries(to cover the transfer time to/from the emergency generator). Jan 23, 1991 at 1640 hrs this system was tested {{under the supervision of}} the Terry Ross, Marv Johnson, Dan Markley, Kelly Dixon, and John Urbin. The power feeder to the emergency power grid at DO was disconnected. The generator responded immediately and was supplying power to the emergency power grid in less than 10 seconds. During the 10 seconds that there was no power on the emergency grid the UPS switched on its inverter and provided uninterrupted power to the cryogenic control system and the ODH system. All of the motorized equipment shut off instrument air compressor, vacuum pumps 1 and 2, insulating <b>vacuum</b> <b>blower,</b> glycol cooling pumps, cooling tower fan, and Exhaust Fan 7 (EF 7). Upon reengagement of power to the grid from the emergency generator, all of the motorized loads started back up with the exception of vacuum pumps 1 and 2, and the UPS inverter turned off. Vacuum pumps 1 and 2 were delay started 20 seconds by the cryogenic control system as not to cause too large of a surge in power by all of the inductive loads starting at once. The DO building elevator which is also on emergency power was test run while the emergency generator was on line with all other emergency loads. The emergency generator current was 140 amps with all loads on line and running except the building elevator. This load of 140 amps is 27 % of the generator's capacity. The cryogenic control and ODH system continued to function properly throughout the entire test due to the UPS responding correctly to each power situation. The cryogenic control system isolated both the Utility(UV) and insulating(IV) vacuum systems as to preserve their vacua while the pumps were off. Once the vacuum pumps were reestablished the IV and UV vacua were put back on line to their respective pumps by the cryogenic control system. The instrument air is backed up by a high pressure trailer, regulated down to instrument air pressure and switches automatically on line through a check valve. During the time that the instrument air compressor was off, instrument air never went below 80 psig (high pressure regulator setting) ...|$|R
