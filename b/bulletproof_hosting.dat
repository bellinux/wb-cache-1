50|$|Some Internet hosting firms {{advertise}} bulk-friendly or <b>bulletproof</b> <b>hosting.</b> This means that, {{unlike most}} ISPs, {{they will not}} terminate a customer for spamming. These hosting firms operate as clients of larger ISPs, and many have eventually been taken offline by these larger ISPs {{as a result of}} complaints regarding spam activity. Thus, while a firm may advertise <b>bulletproof</b> <b>hosting,</b> it is ultimately unable to deliver without the connivance of its upstream ISP. However, some spammers have managed to get what is called a pink contract (see below) - a contract with the ISP that allows them to spam without being disconnected.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bulletproof</b> <b>hosting</b> {{providers}} have a {{high rate}} of turnover, as many hosting providers choose to shut down, whether forcibly or voluntarily, if their alternative would be to compromise client freedom (as this is their main selling point).|$|E
50|$|In early 2013 it {{came under}} a large DDoS attack moving from <b>bulletproof</b> <b>hosting</b> {{provider}} Santrex to Off-sho.re, {{the latter being}} a participant of the Stophaus campaign against Spamhaus. The site has had an ongoing feud with security researcher Brian Krebs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} are some notable examples of <b>bulletproof</b> <b>hosts,</b> with their takedown time: ...|$|R
50|$|Often, a <b>bulletproof</b> <b>host</b> {{allows a}} content {{provider}} {{to bypass the}} laws or contractual terms of service regulating Internet content and service use in its own country of operation, {{as many of these}} 'bulletproof hosts' are based 'overseas' (relative to the geographical location of the content provider).|$|R
50|$|Santrex was a {{web hosting}} {{provider}} that specialised in <b>bulletproof</b> <b>hosting,</b> hosting many cybercrime forums. The service was {{registered in the}} Seychelles and once hosted the Darkode hacking forums {{as well as the}} Italian Hacking Team security organisation's control server for the Carabinieri.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bulletproof</b> <b>hosting</b> is {{a service}} {{provided}} by some domain hosting or web hosting firms that allows their customer considerable leniency {{in the kinds}} of material they may upload and distribute. This leniency has been taken advantage of by spammers and providers of online gambling or illegal pornography.|$|E
50|$|Many large botnets {{tend to use}} domains {{rather than}} IRC in their {{construction}} (see Rustock botnet and Srizbi botnet). They are usually hosted with <b>bulletproof</b> <b>hosting</b> services. This {{is one of the}} earliest types of C&C. A zombie computer accesses a specially-designed webpage or domain(s) which serves the list of controlling commands. The advantages of using webpages or domains as C&C is that a large botnet can be effectively controlled and maintained with very simple code that can be readily updated.|$|E
50|$|Background {{research}} tasks included {{learning from}} past drug lords, researching legal matters, studying {{law enforcement agency}} tactics and obtaining legal representation. With regards to the prospective markets hosting, he recommends identifying a hosting country with gaps in their {{mutual legal assistance treaty}} with ones country of residence, avoiding overpriced <b>bulletproof</b> <b>hosting</b> and choosing a web host with Tor support that accepts suitably hard-to-trace payment. Patterns recommend to avoid include hiring hitmen like Dread Pirate Roberts and sharing handles for software questions on sites like Stack Exchange.|$|E
5000|$|After it {{had been}} sold and resold during {{the onset of the}} dot-com bubble, UUNET {{acquired}} the nickname SpewSpewNET. This nickname was given because UUNET had become a home for many distributors of spam, including distributors of both Newsgroup spam and E-mail spam. UUNET also became known for providing <b>bulletproof</b> <b>hosting</b> to many web pages whose chief form of advertisement was spam. Because UUNET started with a loan from Usenix and controlled the e-mail addresses for moderated Usenet groups, it was hard to block email traffic to or from Usenet. In 1997, UUNET had lost so much credit that on 1 August, after finding alternate routes for moderated newsgroups, a Usenet death penalty (UDP) was issued against UUNET. A week later, the UDP was lifted. In 1998 UUNET threatened legal action for hosting a GIF image with [...] "SPAMUNET" [...] on it.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{possibility}} of using hosting IP addresses to identify potential spam domains. Current domain blacklisting may not be effective if spammers keep replacing blacklisted domains with newly registered domains. In this study, we cluster spam domains based on their hosting IP addresses and associated email subjects. We found some hosting IP addresses were heavily used by spammers to host a large number of domains and persisted for much longer period of time than related domains. Our results show that hosting IP blacklisting should be effective against many point-of-sale spam campaigns, such as pharmaceutical, sexual enhancement and luxury good spam, which mainly use static IP addresses to host their websites. The IP addresses remain active from several days to even a couple of months before replaced by a set of new IPs. Therefore, even when new spam domains appear from time to time, they can be immediately detected as spam domains by looking up the hosting IP address. The reported IP addresses are also useful for law enforcement investigators to identify ISPs that provide <b>bulletproof</b> <b>hosting</b> services to spammers. The detection and termination of spam domains and their hosts will severely impede spammers ’ capability to generate revenue from spam. 1...|$|E

Her research is on network security {{with a focus on}} network monitoring and routing security. Runtime: 47 : 08 minutesBulletproof hosting Autonomous Systems (ASes) —malicious ASes fully dedicated to supporting cybercrime—provide freedom and resources for a cyber-criminal to operate. Their services include hosting a wide range of illegal content, botnet C&C servers, and other malicious resources. Thousands of new ASes are registered every year, many of which are often used exclusively to facilitate cybercrime. A natural approach to squelching <b>bulletproof</b> <b>hosting</b> ASes is to develop a reputation system that can identify them for takedown by law enforcement and as input to other attack detection systems (e. g., spam filters, botnet detection systems). Unfortunately, current AS reputation systems rely primarily on data-plane monitoring of malicious activity from IP addresses (and thus can only detect malicious ASes after attacks are underway), and are not able to distinguish between malicious and legitimate but abused ASes. As a complement to these systems, in this paper, we explore a fundamentally different approach to establishing AS reputation. We present ASwatch, a system that identifies malicious ASes using exclusively the control-plane (i. e., routing) behavior of ASes. ASwatch’s design is based on the intuition that, in an attempt to evade possible detection and remediation efforts, malicious ASes exhibit “agile” control plane behavior (e. g., short-lived routes, aggressive re-wiring). We evaluate our system on known malicious ASes; our results show that ASwatch detects up to 93 % of malicious ASes with a 5 % false positive rate, which is reasonable to effectively complement existing defense systems...|$|E
