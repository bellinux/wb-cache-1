25|$|According to this account, {{the subject}} {{attempts}} to <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> and finds herself {{unable to do}} so, creating a sensation of resistance, which the threat-activated vigilance system interprets as an unearthly being sitting on her chest, threatening suffocation. The sensation of entrapment causes a feedback loop when the fear of suffocation increases {{as a result of}} continued helplessness, causing the subject to struggle to end the SP episode.|$|E
5000|$|Reduced lung function, {{making it}} more {{difficult}} to <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> and vigorously. Breathing may become more rapid and more shallow than normal, and a person's ability to engage in vigorous activities may be limited.|$|E
50|$|IPPB may be {{indicated}} {{for patients}} {{who are at risk}} for developing atelectasis and who are unable or unwilling to <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> without assistance. In patients with severe lung hyperinflation, IPPB may decrease dyspnea and discomfort during nebulized therapy.|$|E

50|$|The {{practice}} of vegetotherapy involves the analyst enabling {{the patient to}} physically simulate the bodily effects of strong emotions. In this technique, the patient is asked to remove his or her outer clothing, lie down on a sheet-covered bed in the doctor's office, and <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> and rhythmically.|$|E
50|$|This is {{your chance}} to travel back in time nearly 180 years. Hear the blasts of muskets firing; the {{pounding}} of horses' hooves; the chanting songs of Indiana braves. <b>Breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> of the evening air filled with the sharp scent of gunpowder. Enjoy the breeze of a star-studded Indiana night.|$|E
5000|$|As the rebreather has {{a single}} [...] "pendulum" [...] {{breathing}} tube, the diver must <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> to avoid carbon dioxide build-up. The counterlung is eight litres. As with all rebreathers, the diver should breathe continuously to keep the gas flowing over the absorbent. Dives on the unit are limited to 90 minutes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it isn't like {{anything}} but itself!" [...] answered Diana, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply.</b> [...] "Why, it's all cold, {{and yet it}} feels like fire." ...|$|R
50|$|Being aware or {{conscious}} of one's <b>breathing.</b> <b>Breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> {{in a natural}} rhythm without being preoccupied by breathing. Inhaling and exhaling whilst in remembrance of God.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Go' lumme!' remarked the shepherdess, smacking her lips, 'that was somethin' like!' And she put out {{her tongue}} and licked her lips, and then <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply.</b>|$|R
50|$|Different {{types of}} {{diseases}} or conditions {{that affect the}} chest include pleurisy, flail chest, atelectasis, and the most common condition, chest pain. These conditions can be hereditary or caused by birth defects or trauma. Any condition that lowers the ability to either <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> or to cough is considered a chest disease or condition.|$|E

5000|$|Kussmaul is {{respiratory}} {{compensation for}} a metabolic acidosis, most commonly occurring in diabetics in diabetic ketoacidosis. Blood gases {{of a patient}} with Kussmaul breathing will show a low partial pressure of CO2 in conjunction with low bicarbonate because of a forced increased respiration (blowing off the carbon dioxide). Base excess is severely negative. The patient feels an urge to <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply,</b> an [...] "air hunger", and it appears almost involuntary.|$|E
60|$|She paused, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply,</b> {{a little}} frightened {{at her own}} eloquence. Something {{told her that she}} was not only {{addressing}} her own soul--she was speaking to his.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{said the}} incensed skipper, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> {{as the door}} closed and they walked up Liston Street, [...] "what the deuce {{do you mean by}} it?" ...|$|R
60|$|STEPHEN: (With {{elaborate}} gestures, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> and slowly) You are my guests. Uninvited. By {{virtue of}} the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, [...] "We have {{to suspend}} disbelief over the casting, but that's easier since we can believe {{the stories of}} these people. Not many movies probe into matters of {{identity}} or adaptation. Most movie characters are like Greek gods and comic book heroes: We learn their roles and powers {{at the beginning of}} the story, and they never change. Here are complex, troubled, flawed people, brave enough to <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> and take one more risk with their lives." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Michael G. Nastos states [...] "Jack DeJohnette's {{follow-up}} recording to Music in the Key of Om is a similarly meditative effort where he plays all the instruments, assumedly overdubbed, creating {{a wash of}} ambient ritual sound texts in a single continuous piece running over 60 minutes... This music demonstrates a fascinating aspect of DeJohnette's musical life, liberating for him for sure, and a statement that is meaningful. Be patient; <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> of clean air, and drink of this truly reflective listening experience that deserves its own audience".|$|E
5000|$|Mangan's {{previous}} solo effort, 2011's Oh Fortune {{earned him}} a JUNO Award for New Artist of the Year and for Alternative Album of the Year. Club Meds comes after a two-year hiatus in Mangans' career so he could concentrate on being a father. Blacksmith is formed {{by a variety of}} Vancouver musicians, primarily Kenton Loewen, Gordon Grdina and John Walsh. A press release by the group claims that [...] "Through a fog of analog feedback loops and synths, the bandâ€™s performances <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> and steadily like a dragon at rest." ...|$|E
60|$|Bella ceased and <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply,</b> {{the while}} she clasped her fine small {{hands in her}} ample silken lap. But her pink {{fairness}} blushed faintly through her skin and warmed {{her eyes as she}} relived her prince-days.|$|R
60|$|Billy {{grinned and}} rolled {{over on his}} side, his head uphill and his feet toward the fire. A couple of feet away Bridge paralleled him, and in five minutes both were <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> in healthy slumber.|$|R
6000|$|Lord Harry <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply.</b> [...] "If {{the man is}} in {{so serious}} a condition," [...] he said, [...] "is it safe or prudent {{for us to be}} alone in the house without a servant and without a nurse?" ...|$|R
50|$|Snipers {{are trained}} to squeeze the trigger {{straight}} back with the ball of their finger, to avoid jerking the gun sideways. The most accurate position is prone, with a sandbag supporting the stock, and the stock's cheek-piece against the cheek. In the field, a bipod can be used instead. Sometimes a sling is wrapped around the weak arm (or both) to reduce stock movement. Some doctrines train a sniper to <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> before shooting, then hold their lungs empty while they line up and take their shot. Some go further, teaching their snipers to shoot between heartbeats to minimize barrel motion.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the general}} basis, Monroe and Olivier did receive {{particular}} praise for their performances; however, not all reviews were kind to their work. One review stated that [...] "Sir Laurence is kept {{pretty much a}} stuffed-shirt, wearing a monocle and speaking in Teutonic accents that are unpleasant and hard to understand. And Miss Monroe mainly has to giggle, wiggle, <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> and flirt. She {{does not make the}} showgirl a person, simply another of her pretty oddities." [...] Other critics noted Monroe and Olivier's lack of on-screen chemistry, while other reviews praised it. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a [...] "fresh" [...] rating of 86%.|$|E
5000|$|From 1946-1955, McClosky {{founded and}} {{directed}} the Plymouth Rock Center of Music and Drama, but during this time he continued his work in voice teaching and vocal therapy. [...] From 1950-1967 he taught voice at Boston University. In 1952 he was appointed Staff Associate in Voice Therapy at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, and in 1959 he published his first book, Your Voice At Its Best. In 1960, he joined the presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy to coach the future president on his voice use. Dave Powers, an aide to Kennedy, later recalled, [...] "Mr. McClosky's advice to all comers...is to relax, maintain good posture, <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply,</b> and reduce any tightness in the neck." ...|$|E
60|$|Austen did not smile. She was {{speaking}} quietly, {{but he saw}} that she was <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply,</b> and he knew that she possessed a courage which went far beyond that of most women, and an insight into life and affairs.|$|R
6000|$|There was a portentous silence. Percy {{stared at}} the floor. Lady Caroline <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply.</b> Lord Marshmoreton, feeling that {{something}} was expected of him, said [...] "Good Gad!" [...] and gazed seriously at a stuffed owl on a bracket. Maud and Reggie Byng came in.|$|R
60|$|What o'clock it was {{she could}} not guess. Averil was sound asleep, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> and regularly, so that it was; a {{pleasure}} to listen to her; and Mary did not fear wakening her by a shoeless voyage of discovery to the place whence Dr. May was visible.|$|R
5000|$|At {{this level}} (lines 537-585), the revelation-seeker is {{supposed}} to <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> and feel himself lifted up, as if in midair, hearing and seeing nothing of mortal beings on earth. He is promised to see instead the divine order of the [...] "visible gods" [...] rising and setting. Ritual silence is prescribed, followed by another sequence of hissing, popping, and thirteen magic words: [...] "Then {{you will see the}} gods looking graciously upon you and no longer rushing at you, but rather going about in their own order of affairs." [...] After a shocking crash of thunder, another admonition of silence, and a magic incantation, the disk of the sun is to open and issue five-pointed stars. The eyes are to be closed for the following prayer.|$|E
50|$|Archie {{brings his}} new hot air balloon {{invention}} to the nursery. The {{children have been}} making chicks so he tries {{to use one of}} them for a passenger, but it's very sticky and Archie gets in a mess and pops his balloon. He becomes very angry so Miss Hoolie gives him a juice box and sends him home to calm down. At home he decides to build a tower out of yogurt pots, but it falls down and he gets angry again and he squashes his juicebox. He goes to buy another one at Pocket and Sweets but then he drops his money and gets angry again. Suzy gives him chocolate but that makes him worse. Penny helps him to <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> then Josie Jump teaches him some exercises to help calm him down.|$|E
5000|$|Morton used a newly {{developed}} apparatus, later called the Morton Etherizer, {{to deliver the}} diethyl-ether vapors, holding the mouthpiece to Abbott's lips and instructing him to <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> and slowly. Abbott fell into an unconscious, sleeplike state within three to four minutes, and did not react when Morton made the first incision in his neck for the surgery. During the surgery, Warren noted that {{the blood of the}} patient was very dark, and thought that the anesthesia might be producing its effect through carbonization of the blood, a remark which was met with a burst of applause. [...] Upon awakening after the surgery, he announced that he had felt a scratching sensation, but no pain. John Collins Warren turned to the observers and proclaimed, [...] "Gentlemen, this is no humbug." [...] Bigelow immediately published an article describing the event and the news quickly travelled to Europe and other parts of America.|$|E
60|$|She swung {{about with}} a start, her music {{dropping}} to the floor, {{and stared at}} him. Her tattered blue kimono fell away at her elbows, her full throat was bare, and a slipper she had kicked off {{lay on the floor}} beside her. He recoiled a little, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply.</b> She stared at him.|$|R
25|$|Rib fractures, {{common in}} breast, {{prostate}} and other cancers with rib metastases, can cause brief severe pain on twisting the trunk, coughing, laughing, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> or moving between sitting and lying. In breast, prostate or lung cancer, multiple myeloma {{and some other}} cancers, sudden onset limb or back pain may indicate pathological bone fracture (most often in the upper femur).|$|R
60|$|The miner {{took this}} simple {{statement}} as a challenging question. His excitement visibly increased, {{but he did}} not at once reply. He talked on aimlessly, incoherently, struggling like a small animal in a torrent. He rose at last, and as he stood in the doorway, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply,</b> his face livid in the sunset light, the muscles of his jaw trembled.|$|R
