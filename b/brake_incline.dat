50|$|Funiculars used in mines were {{sometimes}} unpowered gravity planes, {{also known as}} self-acting <b>inclines</b> or <b>brake</b> <b>inclines.</b> The weight of descending loaded wagons was used to pull the empty mine wagons.|$|R
25|$|Bartlett met John Miller in 1928, {{and they}} {{commenced}} building the new ride. When the ride went into production, {{much of the}} idea was the same, but the cars looks more like monoplanes, which Bartlett designed. Miller worked on the loading station, supporting structure, <b>braking</b> system and <b>incline.</b>|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 19th Century {{and early}} 20th Century, the Moss Valley {{was the home}} to the Westminster Colliery in its {{northern}} end, and Gatewen Colliery at the southern end. The coal was distributed both locally and nationally through major railway links, much of which was built specifically for the distribution of goods. The colliery's railways were linked to neighbouring Great Western Railway lines. This originally was the Wheatsheaf Branch which ran from the Wheatsheaf Junction of the Chester line, then up a worked incline up Gwersyllt Hill, and then through the 220 ft Summerhill Tunnel to Westminster Colliery. The line then continued through {{the other side of}} the valley through the 400 ft Brymbo Tunnel, up a second worked incline to Brymbo Steelworks. The western portal of the Summerhill Tunnel is still visible as of 2008, although its eastern portal and both portals of the Brymbo tunnel have been buried. In 1862 the GWR Ffrwd Branch from the Croesnewydd Junction was opened to transport railway traffic over a much more 'normal' terrain between the Chester line and Brymbo, replacing the Brymbo half of the Wheatsheaf Branch. A Moss Branch was later created from the Ffrwd Branch, making the Wheatsheaf Branch, its <b>brake</b> <b>inclines</b> and two tunnels defunct by 1908. The Great Central Railway Brymbo Branch also ran through the valley, and the Moss Valley station is still visible.|$|R
50|$|Most drum motors can {{be fitted}} with back stop {{non-reversing}} bearings to prevent belts in inclined conveyors from rolling back or with electro-magnetic <b>brakes</b> for reversible <b>inclined</b> conveyors or for quick stopping. Incremental encoders {{can also be}} integrated into the rotor bearings to provide a closed loop control system for tracking, positioning and accurate tracing of the product on the belt.|$|R
50|$|Lawson eagerly {{began work}} in the {{colliery}} {{the day after he}} turned twelve. He started as a trapper, opening and shutting doors for the drivers, working a ten-hour day. He was paid ten pence per day, and his life greatly improved - he was treated as an adult now. After a few months he became a driver, with his own pony. After a couple more years, he began off-hand work, <b>braking</b> <b>inclines</b> and attending to the signalling bells. He began attending union meetings, including the annual Durham Miners' Gala, where in later years he met the likes of Will Crooks, Ellen Wilkinson, Ernest Bevin and George Lansbury. At eighteen he became a putter and began speaking and working for the union. With five members of the family now working at the colliery, the Lawsons had a higher status and moved into a house closer to the pit, with a front room. Throughout this period his he gambled frequently and read a lot: Eventually, reading won over gambling. He had read nothing of economics or politics yet, but had developed a strong sense of injustice, firmly believing that manual workers were under-paid and under-valued. These ideas generally seemed strange to his colleagues and family and he kept them to himself. He joined the Methodist Society, and found his ideas more accepted there. Through reading the Labour Leader and The Clarion, Lawson realised he was a socialist. At the age of 21 he met Isabella Graham Scott, a domestic servant from Sunderland who was staying with friends at Boldon. They were married in February 1906.|$|R
50|$|In 1881 the Corkickle <b>Brake,</b> an <b>inclined</b> wagonway 525 yd {{in length}} and with {{gradients}} of between 1 in 5.2 and 1 in 6.6 was built from the Furness Railway main line, a short distance {{to the south of}} Corkickle station, to the Earl of Lonsdale's Croft Pit. The 'brake' closed in 1931 due to the worsening financial situation of the colliery's owners, Lonsdale's Whitehaven Colliery Co. In May 1955, the incline was re-opened, this time to serve the factory of Marchon Products - a subsidiary of Albright and Wilson - at Kells. It was used mainly to haul rail tanker wagons containing sulphuric acid from the main line - by now in the ownership of British Railways - to the Marchon factory. The Corkickle Brake closed for good on 31 October 1986 and the task of transporting the acid and other chemicals was taken over by road tankers.|$|R
50|$|Flying Turns is {{the name}} of a {{specific}} model of bobsled roller coaster. John Norman Bartlett, a British aviator in World War I, came to North America after the war with an idea for a trackless wooden chute, full of twists like a bobsled course, with toboggan-like cars, based on a bobsled ride that operated in Europe. He filed a patent for the idea in 1926. Bartlett met John Miller in 1928, and they commenced building the new ride. When the ride went into production, much of the idea was the same, but the cars looks more like monoplanes, which Bartlett designed. Miller worked on the loading station, supporting structure, <b>braking</b> system and <b>incline.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Because driver's hatch {{was moved}} from the glacis plate and {{positioned}} so that he exited the vehicle perpendicularly instead of crawling out of the hatch, his seat received an elevating mechanism. While in a relatively safe area the driver could elevate his seat to look outside of the tank, providing greater visibility and easier access to the controls. While in combat the driver lowered his seat back into the tank and {{had to rely on}} the vision slot protected by [...] (three-layer glass). While in this position the pedals of the main clutch, the fuel supply, and <b>incline</b> <b>brake</b> were positioned much higher and the levers of the steering clutch and gear shifting became inconvenient to operate. Early examples had transmission problems. While the driver was switching gears, two gears could engage simultaneously, which caused a broken gear pinion. This and other gearbox related problems were solved in a 1961 T-44M modernization with the introduction of a gearbox from the T-54 main battle tank.|$|R
40|$|The {{inclined}} lifts, in case {{of emergency}} braking, can experience high longitudinal decelerations {{that can lead to}} passengersâ€™ collisions with lift walls and interior elements. In 2014 the CEN/TC 10 WG 1 published the part 22 of the norm series 81 with regard to the construction elements and installation of electrical lifts with inclined trajectory. This norm stablishes, amongst other requirements, the maximum and minimum deceleration levels in both longitudinal and vertical directions. Both requirements, in opposite senses and the definition of the braking system, do not cause design difficulties {{in case of}} high slopes, but in case of lifts with the slope under a certain level they can be needed, to guarantee the fulfilment of the norm, elements that allow and additional relative displacement between the braking system and the cabin. To define the performances and the optimal behaviour of these systems it has been defined a simulation model of the dynamical behaviour of the lift under the conditions of the norm tests. Additionally, in this work it is presented a calculation methodology to define the cabin allowable weight corridor, for each braking effort made by each safety gear model, and the simulations have been validated with the results of tests with different braking efforts, weights and lift slopes. The present work has been performed in cooperation with Thyssen Krupp Elevadores with the aim of improving the knowledge of the <b>brake</b> dynamics of <b>inclined</b> lifts...|$|R
5000|$|Tourists often venture {{further up}} the West Coast north of Westport. Originally {{there was a}} narrow, steep and winding road to the township, but the steeper section of road has been closed and diverted, going {{directly}} to Stockton via 'The Grand Canyon'. Access is now off the new upper road section & is signposted, entering the township via the original road from the North-eastern end of the town. This 'old' road continues through the town and west towards the historic Millerton Incline, the Portal and Dam (part of an inclined rail system that took coal down to Granity). There are some spectacular views here across the rainforest to the coast and north towards the Karamea headland. The closed section of old road can be walked down {{as far as the}} Millerton 'Granity Creek' Bridge. Where there are a series of spectacular waterfalls to be viewed. There is parking at either end of this walking section. The local community offers maps and information at the local community hall (in the township). There are several short walks in and around Millerton with historic sites and scenic views. The Bathhouse walks are a hidden gem in this area, and the Bathhouses themselves are of historic value too. A creek formed the reservoir dam where the coal miners used to come and bathe after a long day mining, and remnants of the pipework which flowed with hot water heated by the mines still remains at the site. In the township area you can see the mine sites and also the <b>incline</b> <b>brake</b> head.|$|R
