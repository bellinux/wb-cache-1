50|$|For {{the initial}} 1934 dive Sheppard and {{colleague}} Francis Graham Balcombe constructed the first underwater <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> <b>for</b> cave diving. This amazing contraption was constructed with recycled household items, including a bicycle pump and tobacco tin. It provided {{the means for}} the pioneering exploration of Swildon's Hole and other caves in Mendip. The bicycle respirator is composed of several key elements: rubber mouth attachment, a flexible hosepipe, bicycle pump and tobacco tin stopper, all held together with metal clips. It {{is a kind of}} homemade snorkel but designed to be attached to a pump to supply the air for underwater cave diving. The bicycle respirator can be seen at Wells and Mendip Museum.|$|R
5000|$|Currently, {{language}} in German as in English, tauchen = [...] "diving" [...] only means in water. Until {{the middle of}} the 20th century the German word tauchen = [...] "to dive" [...] also meant [...] "to stay in unbreathable atmosphere". Thus around 1900 a water-cooled fire protection hood with air supply for firefighters was called in German a Feuertaucher (= [...] "fire diver"), and still into the 1940s in German a man with a <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> <b>for</b> use in unbreathable atmosphere was called a Gastaucher (= [...] "gas diver"). But as escape sets were used more for rescue from sunken submarines and as light diving equipment, the German word [...] "tauchen" [...] was restricted to underwater meanings.|$|R
40|$|There is {{interest}} in solid materials containing {{a high percentage}} of stored oxygen for use in emergency <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> <b>for</b> miners and as auxiliary oxygen sources for astronauts. In theory, the amount of available oxygen in calcium superoxide, Ca(O 2) 2 is higher than in potassium superoxide, KO 2, and its availability during use should be unhindered by the formation of a low melting and hydrous coating. The decomposition of solid calcium peroxide diperoxyhydrate, CaO 2. 2 H 2 O 2 has been studied, using an apparatus which allows good control of the critical reaction parameters. Samples have been prepared showing apparent superoxide contents in excess of those previously reported and higher than the theoretical 58. 4 % expected from a disproportionation reaction...|$|R
40|$|The Oregon Fish Commission {{received}} a {{contract from the}} U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, under the Saltonstall-Kennedy Act for a study to develop methods for determining the behavior of juvenile salmonids in reservoirs. The study, consisting of a literature survey and field program, was conducted in Felton and North Fork Reservoirs on the Deschutes and Clackamas Rivers, Oregon, between September 30, 1959 and January 31, 1962. Pelton Reservoir contains chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), blueback salmon (0. nerka), and summer-run steelhead trout (Salmo airdneri); North Fork Reservoir contains chinook salmon, silver salmon (0. kisutch 1 and winter-run steelhead trout.

50|$|Firefighting {{equipment}} in the United States is based on lightweight materials developed for the U.S. Space Program. NASA and the National Bureau of Standards created a lightweight breathing system including face mask, frame, harness, and air bottle, using an aluminum composite material developed by NASA for use on rocket casings. The broadest fire-related technology transfer is the <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> <b>for</b> protection from smoke inhalation injury. Additionally, NASA’s inductorless electronic circuit technology led to lower-cost, more rugged, short-range two-way radio now used by firefighters. NASA also helped develop a specialized mask weighing less than 3 oz to protect the physically impaired from injuries to the face and head, as well as flexible, heat-resistant materials—developed to protect the space shuttle on reentry—which are being used both by the military and commercially in suits for municipal and aircraft-rescue firefighters.|$|R
