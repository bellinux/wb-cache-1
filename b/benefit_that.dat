5|$|Renewable energy {{continued}} its {{rapid growth in}} 2015, providing multiple benefits. There was a new record set for installed wind and photovoltaic capacity (64GW and 57GW) and a new high of US$329 Billion for global renewables investment. A key <b>benefit</b> <b>that</b> this investment growth brings is a growth in jobs. The top countries for investment in recent years were China, Germany, Spain, the United States, Italy, and Brazil. Renewable energy companies include BrightSource Energy, First Solar, Gamesa, GE Energy, Goldwind, Sinovel, Targray, Trina Solar, Vestas, and Yingli.|$|E
5|$|Signals {{are given}} in {{contexts}} such as mate selection by females, which subjects the advertising males' signals to selective pressure. Signals thus evolve because they modify the behaviour of the receiver to benefit the signaller. Signals may be honest, conveying information which usefully increases the fitness of the receiver, or dishonest. An individual can cheat by giving a dishonest signal, which might briefly <b>benefit</b> <b>that</b> signaller, {{at the risk of}} undermining the signalling system for the whole population.|$|E
5|$|The {{positions}} of the world's major medical organizations range from considering elective circumcision of babies and children as having no benefit and significant risks to having a modest health <b>benefit</b> <b>that</b> outweighs small risks. No major medical organization recommends either universal circumcision of all males or banning the procedure. Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and human rights have been raised over the circumcision of babies and children for non-medical reasons; for these reasons the procedure is controversial.|$|E

40|$|Studies on the {{persistence}} of commissioning benefits to date have {{used a variety of}} methods to evaluate this persistence. This paper proposes a consistent framework for describing and evaluating {{the persistence}} of commissioning benefits. It begins by splitting commissioning benefits into two broad categories: 1) <b>benefits</b> <b>that</b> inherently persist; and 2) <b>benefits</b> <b>that</b> may not persist. The study of persistence then considers only the <b>benefits</b> <b>that</b> may not persist. These benefits are critical, since the top five reasons cited for performing commissioning in both new buildings and existing buildings are <b>benefits</b> <b>that</b> may not persist. These benefits are then further divided into <b>benefits</b> <b>that</b> may be quantified and <b>benefits</b> <b>that</b> are generally difficult to quantify. This paper proposes <b>that</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>that</b> may be quantified should generally be evaluated for persistence using approaches that are already widely accepted and used for other purposes, with adaptations where needed. Specifically, it proposes that energy and water savings be evaluated using methods consistent with the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (adapted with additional weather normalization), that comfort and indoor air quality improvements be evaluated using relevant standards, specifically ASHRAE Standard 55 and ASHRAE Standard 62, but goes further and proposes a methodology for economic quantification of these benefits as well. Finally, it is proposed that {{the persistence of}} measures whose benefit is difficult to quantify be evaluated simply by determining whether the measure is still in place or performing...|$|R

5|$|This {{compliance}} requirement establishes {{that each}} program operates {{for a specific}} purpose (such as the care of elderly persons or the education of children), and that funds provided for the program must only be used in activities that <b>benefit</b> <b>that</b> purpose.

5|$|The Costume Institute Gala {{is a major}} {{fundraising}} <b>benefit</b> <b>that</b> {{serves as}} an opening celebration for the Institute's annual fashion exhibit. Following the event, the exhibition runs for several months. The 2014 exhibition was scheduled to run from May 8 until August 10, 2014. The Gala {{is widely regarded as}} one of the most exclusive social events in New York and one of the biggest fundraising nights in the city with $9 million raised in 2013 and a record of $12 million the following year. It is one of the most notable sources of funding for the Institute. The affair, attended by personalities from the arts, fashion, high-society, film and music, has been held at the Met since 1948 and is considered to be the fashion industry's premier annual red carpet event. Its red carpet fashions are widely photographed, reviewed, critiqued and emulated. The museum is closed to the general public on the first Monday of May due to the gala occurring.|$|E
5|$|Following Emery Reves's {{death in}} 1981, the Dallas Museum of Art in the United States {{approached}} Wendy Reves {{knowing that there}} was a possibility that her art collection at La Pausa might be given to a museum. In exchange for the 1985 donation Reves insisted that the museum recreate six of the principal rooms at La Pausa, and display the collection there as she had arranged it. The collection of 1,400 objet d'art is displayed at the museum as the Wendy and Emery Reves Collection in a reconstruction of five rooms from La Pausa. The villa's central courtyard and patio were reconstructed at the museum along with the villa's dining room, library, salon, bedroom, and hall, situated in a purpose built 16,500-square-foot wing designed by architect Edward Larrabee Barnes. Wendy Reves also donated $3 million to the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, to establish the Reves Center for International Studies, and directed that the Reves Foundation <b>benefit</b> <b>that</b> college with 40 percent of annual endowment funding. She also chose for herself and her late husband Emery Reves to be buried at William and Mary.|$|E

5|$|The coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, chestnut, brown, {{or nearly}} black in colour) {{separated}} by light hair (usually white or cream in colour). Male giraffes become darker as they age. The coat pattern has been claimed {{to serve as}} camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands. While adult giraffes standing among trees and bushes are hard to see at even a few metres' distance, they actively move into the open to gain the best view of an approaching predator, obviating any <b>benefit</b> <b>that</b> camouflage might bring. Instead, the adults rely on their size and ability to defend themselves. However, camouflage appears to be important for calves, which spend {{a large part of}} the day in hiding, away from their mothers; further, over half of all calves die within a year, so predation is certainly important. It appears, therefore, that the spotted coat of the giraffe functions as camouflage for the young, while adults simply inherit this coloration as a by-product. The skin underneath the dark areas may serve as windows for thermoregulation, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern.|$|E

25|$|In {{the field}} of social security, a number of {{important}} reforms in welfare provision were introduced during Cosgrave's premiership. In 1974, sickness insurance, unemployment insurance, and occupational injuries coverage were extended to all employees, while earnings-related components were added to the basic flat-rate sickness benefit, the basic flat-rate short-term occupational injury benefit, and the basic flat-rate unemployment <b>benefit.</b> <b>That</b> same year, pension insurance was extended to all employees, and a means-tested allowance for the wives of prisoners was introduced.|$|E
25|$|Robert Birrell has {{asserted}} that high immigration levels {{are being used}} by the Federal Government to stimulate aggregate economic growth, but that per capita growth is more important to Australians. Birrell concluded that high migration does not benefit existing residents, because it dilutes the <b>benefit</b> <b>that</b> can accrue from the export of non-renewable resources which form {{a large part of the}} Australian economy. As well, Birrell argues that a slowdown in labour force growth would require employers to pay greater attention to training, wages and conditions of workers.|$|E

25|$|Antonio's brother Francesco had {{sided with}} the Spanish and split the {{conclave}} {{and it was his}} negotiations that resulted in Pamphili's election. The final deal in Pamphili's favour included an agreement, designed by the brothers for their own <b>benefit,</b> <b>that</b> the new Pope would allow the Barberini to keep the titles, land and fortunes they had amassed under Pope Urban VIII's reign. Mazarin became so angry because of Antonio's attitude that he deprived him of the protectorate of the Kingdom of France. However, the conflict was of short duration and both cardinals quickly reconciled with each other.|$|E
25|$|He greatly {{advanced}} {{knowledge of}} venereal disease and introduced many new techniques of surgery, including new methods for repairing {{damage to the}} Achilles tendon and a more effective method for applying ligature of the arteries {{in case of an}} aneurysm. He {{was also one of the}} first to understand the importance of pathology, the danger of the spread of infection and how the problem of inflammation of the wound, bone lesions and even tuberculosis often undid any <b>benefit</b> <b>that</b> was gained from the intervention. He consequently adopted the position that all surgical procedures should be used only as a last resort.|$|E
25|$|On July 22, 2008, the Social Security Administration {{introduced}} a new online benefits estimator. A worker who has enough Social Security credits to qualify for benefits, but who is not currently receiving benefits {{on his or her}} own Social Security record and who is not a Medicare beneficiary, can obtain an estimate of the retirement <b>benefit</b> <b>that</b> will be provided, for different assumptions about age at retirement. This process is done by opening a secure online account called my Social Security. For retirees who have non FICA or SECA taxed wages the rules get complicated and probably require additional help.|$|E

25|$|Two {{significant}} {{factors are}} evident: First, every column in Figure 166 depicts a net <b>benefit</b> <b>that</b> {{is higher than}} any column in Figure 165. In other words, the average married person (with a stay-at-home spouse) gets a greater benefit per FICA tax dollar paid than does the average single person â€“ {{no matter what the}} gender or wage level. Second, there is only limited progressivity among married workers with stay-at-home spouses. Review Figure 166 carefully: The net benefits drop as the wage levels increase from $50,000 to $95,000; however, they increase as the wage levels grow from $5,000 to $50,000. In fact, net benefits are lowest for those earning just $5,000 per year.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, Greenhough took 111 wickets for Lancashire, {{and played}} one Test against South Africa, but 1961 was {{wiped out by}} {{the first of a}} {{succession}} of finger injuries. Even when he had recovered, he again ran into the problem of lacking spin, despite a few good performances as the only recognised slow bowler in a now-weak county side. Despite more finger trouble keeping him out of the Lancashire side for most of 1964, he was awarded a <b>benefit</b> <b>that</b> season and showed when he returned that he still had considerable skill. He achieved a career-best seven for 56 against Worcestershire in the last county match, plus seven for 108 against MCC in the previous game.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} be able to survive in both fresh and salt water also gives another <b>benefit</b> <b>that</b> has been driven by evolution. Because the {{majority}} of sharks are only able to survive in salt water, the bull shark has evolved to have their offspring in the fresh water where other sharks cannot enter. The freshwater acts as a protective area where the young are able to grow and mature without the threat of larger sharks preying on the younger bull sharks. This is an explanation for the behavior that is observed from the Bull sharks as to why there would be any reason for the adult bull shark to ever travel into a freshwater area despite being able to tolerate the high salinity of marine water.|$|E
