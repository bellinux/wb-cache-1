40|$|This study builds upon {{earlier work}} mapping the {{potential}} benefits from bovine trypanosomosis control and analysing the costs of different approaches. Updated costs were derived for five intervention techniques: trypanocides, targets, insecticide-treated cattle, aerial spraying {{and the release of}} sterile males. Two strategies were considered: continuous control and elimination. For mapping the costs, cattle densities, environmental constraints, and the presence of savannah or riverine tsetse species were taken into account. These were combined with maps of potential benefits to produce maps of <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios.</b> The results illustrate a diverse picture, and they clearly indicate that no single technique or strategy is universally profitable. For control using trypanocide prophylaxis, returns are modest, even without accounting for the risk of drug resistance but, in areas of low cattle densities, this is the only approach that yields a positive return. Where cattle densities are sufficient to support it, the use of insecticide-treated cattle stands out as the most consistently profitable technique, widely achieving <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios</b> above 5. In parts of the high-potential areas such as the mixed farming, high-oxen-use zones of western Ethiopia, the fertile crescent north of Lake Victoria and the dairy production areas in western and central Kenya, all tsetse control strategies achieve <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios</b> from 2 to over 15, and for elimination strategies, ratios from 5 to over 20. By contrast, in some areas, notably where cattle densities are below 20 per km 2, the costs of interventions against tsetse match or even outweigh the benefits, especially for control scenarios using aerial spraying or the deployment of targets where both savannah and riverine flies are present. If the burden of human African trypanosomosis were factored in, the <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios</b> of some of the low-return areas would be considerably increased. Comparatively, elimination strategies give rise to higher <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios</b> than do those for continuous control. However, the costs calculated for elimination assume problem-free, large scale operations, and they rest on the outputs of entomological models that are difficult to validate in the field. Experience indicates that the conditions underlying successful and sustained elimination campaigns are seldom met. By choosing the most appropriate thresholds for <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios,</b> decision-makers and planners can use the maps to define strategies, assist in prioritising areas for intervention, and help choose among intervention techniques and approaches. The methodology would have wider applicability in analysing other disease constraints with a strong spatial component. Department for International Development, United KingdomPeer Revie...|$|R

We conducted a modeling study to investigate how replacing annual energy crops with perennial energy crops along Wisconsin waterways could affect a variety of provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. We found that a switch from continuous corn production to perennial-grass production decreased annual income provisioning by 75 %, although it increased annual energy provisioning by 33 %, decreased annual phosphorous loading to surface water by 29 %, increased below-ground carbon sequestration by 30 %, decreased annual nitrous oxide emissions by 84 %, increased an index of pollinator abundance {{by an average of}} 11 %, and increased an index of biocontrol potential by an average of 6 %.

The government chose to try to delay the decision to build the Finse Tunnel until after 1990 so it could be considered along with other railway projects in a central plan.

Chris Hale, lecturer in transport engineering at Melbourne University, said the government was not interested in Infrastructure Australia analysing benefit-cost ratios and that the project was an example of a lack of transparency over the approval and planning of major projects and Victorian Greens MP Greg Barber said the government was terrified that releasing the figures would show the road was not viable.

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} suggests that early life investments in health are associated with improved human capital and economic outcomes. Various recent global studies have simulated the expected economic returns from alternative packages of interventions in reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH). However, very {{little is known about}} the comparability of estimates of the economic returns of RMNCH interventions across studies in low and middle income countries. Our study aims to fill this gap. We performed a comprehensive scoping review of the recent literature (2000 - 2013) on the economic returns (i. e. <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios)</b> of RMNCH-related interventions, conducted in low and middle income countries. A total of 36 studies were identified.

The estimated economic returns fluctuated considerably across settings as the associated costs of disease patterns, social behaviours and health systems varied. Yet, greater sources of variation stemmed from differences in methodology. The observed methodological inconsistencies limit the accuracy and comparability of the estimated returns across various contexts. The reviewed studies suggest that the <b>benefit-cost</b> <b>ratios</b> are favourable in the majority of cases, providing further support to a growing body of economic literature that suggests investments early in life, such as those interventions related to RMNCH, are good investments.
