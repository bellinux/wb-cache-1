5|$|The Crab Bowl Classic, {{also known}} as the Crab <b>Bowl</b> <b>or</b> the Maryland–Navy rivalry, is an American college {{football}} rivalry between the Maryland Terrapins football team of the University of Maryland and the Navy Midshipmen football team of the United States Naval Academy. The two institutions, located in close proximity in the state of Maryland, first met for a football game in 1905. Since then, the series has often been marked by controversy, with incidents by players and supporters occurring {{both on and off the}} field. The winner of the game is awarded the Crab Bowl Trophy.|$|E
5|$|Ceramics lend {{themselves}} to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a <b>bowl</b> <b>or</b> jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13thcentury. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals {{lend themselves}} to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited {{to the shape of}} the vessel they were making. Thus an unglazed earthenware water flask from Aleppo {{in the shape of a}} vertical circle (with handles and neck above) is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an Arabic inscription with a small 8-petalled flower at the centre.|$|E

5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Hokies {{averaged}} 29.3 {{points per game}} and scored at least 21 points in 22 consecutive games—a streak dating to the 1995 season. Virginia Tech's offense was led on the field by quarterback Al Clark, who passed for 1,476 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also ran for 344 yards during the regular season. At the beginning of December, however, Clark underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in order to repair damaged cartilage in the joint. Due to the long recovery time involved with the surgery, it was questioned if he would play in the Gator <b>Bowl</b> <b>or</b> {{if he would be}} able to play at full strength. Four days prior to the game, Clark's presence at the game was put even more in doubt when he caught the flu and developed a 102-degree fever. Clark's backup, redshirt freshman quarterback Nick Sorensen, completed 11 of his 21 pass attempts during the season for 140 yards and two touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Following the Iron Bowl, Alabama's bowl {{destination}} was unclear {{due to the}} SEC championship game, which determined the conference champion on December 5. Until then, speculation centered on Alabama potentially attending any of four games: the Peach Bowl, Independence Bowl, Sun <b>Bowl,</b> <b>or</b> Music City Bowl. By {{the time of the}} championship game, the Sun Bowl had been eliminated as an option. After Tennessee won the SEC championship game and a bid to the Fiesta Bowl, other teams were selected by the Peach Bowl and Independence Bowl, leaving Alabama to be selected for the inaugural Music City Bowl. The choice was made official on December 6, and Alabama began preparing for its matchup with Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Impact crater diameters seen {{range from}} 0.1kma limit {{defined by the}} imaging resolutionto over 100km, not {{counting}} the multi-ring structures. Small craters, with diameters less than 5km, have simple <b>bowl</b> <b>or</b> flat-floored shapes. Those 540km across usually have a central peak. Larger impact features, with diameters in the range 25100km, have central pits instead of peaks, such as Tindr crater. The largest craters with diameters over 60km can have central domes, which are thought to result from central tectonic uplift after an impact; examples include Doh and Hár craters. A small number of very largemore 100km in diameterand bright impact craters show anomalous dome geometry. These are unusually shallow and may be a transitional landform to the multi-ring structures, as with the Lofn impact feature. Callisto's craters are generally shallower than those on the Moon.|$|E

5|$|Wilson's {{last season}} for the Melbourne Cricket Club came in 1893–94. He missed the first two premiership matches of the season, but after top scoring with 47 and taking two wickets in a non-premiership match against Fitzroy, Wilson was {{selected}} for the third match, against North Melbourne. Wilson took 1/72 in the first innings against North, the wicket being that of Isaac Drape, and scored 27 runs batting an number 10. He was not called upon to bat or bowl in the second innings. Wilson was retained in the side for the next match against Carlton. He batted at 11 in the first innings and was on 0 not out when the innings closed. Wilson was not required to <b>bowl</b> <b>or</b> bat again in what ended up being his final match for the MCC. In total, he played 14 matches for Melbourne for a return of 138 runs at a batting average of 10.61 and 15 wickets at a bowling average of 30.73.|$|E
5|$|Bound for Glory is {{considered}} by TNA to be their equivalent to the National Football League's Super <b>Bowl</b> <b>or</b> rival World Wrestling Entertainment's WrestleMania event. As such, TNA used an extensive marketing campaign that involved several wrestlers dressing up as gangsters from the 1920s and 1930s era of Chicago to promote the show {{since it is the}} biggest event the company holds annually. Samoa Joe and The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide) participated in some of these promotional video shoots. This was the first Bound for Glory event to use roman numerals in the title. TNA created a section on their company website to promote Bound for Glory IV. TNA released a poster to promote the show featuring Karen Angle, Joe, Booker T, Kurt Angle, Christian Cage, and Gail Kim. The official theme for the show was Tarantula by The Smashing Pumpkins. A contest was held to win upgraded ringside seats, free merchandise, and meet several TNA performers at Bound for Glory IV by wearing a Halloween costume to the event, with a drawing being held {{prior to the start of}} the telecast.|$|E
5|$|Ron Vanderlinden {{was hired}} as head coach for the 1997 season under a five-year contract. Vanderlinden had helped {{engineer}} turnarounds at Northwestern as defensive coordinator and at Colorado as a defensive assistant. The 1995 Northwestern team in particular had shocked observers when it recorded a 10–2 season and the Big Ten championship. In 1999, Maryland showed signs of significant improvement, and a winning season appeared certain when Maryland possessed a 5–2 record. The Terrapins, however, then suffered a three-game losing streak. In their finale against Virginia, the Terrapins needed a win to garner a likely invitation to either the Aloha <b>Bowl</b> <b>or</b> Oahu Bowl—a Maryland alumnus was {{the chief executive officer}} of both events. The Terrapins came from behind and held the lead, 30–27, with 5:18 left to play. They regained possession with 1:40 remaining, but an inexperienced quarterback unintentionally stopped the clock by going out of bounds. After the ensuing punt, Virginia mounted a touchdown drive to win the game and end Maryland's bowl hopes. Despite narrowly missing a winning season, Vanderlinden was granted a two-year contract extension. In 2000, Maryland again fell short of a winning season and bowl game. The Terrapins entered their season closer with a 5–5 record, and again fell, this time in a rout by 24th-ranked Georgia Tech. Vanderlinden was fired the following day.|$|E
