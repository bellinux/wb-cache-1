In 1925, aircraft builder Donald Douglas and Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler worked together with Caltech president Robert Millikan to bring a state-of-the-art aeronautical research laboratory to the Pasadena college. Douglas recruited some of Caltech's <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>brightest</b> students for his company. Douglas utilized the lab's wind tunnel and research staff while designing his DC-1, 2, and 3. In this way, the DC-3, undoubtedly {{one of the most}} successful aircraft designs ever built, represented more than just a single designer's project. It was a regional product, the result of an alliance of business and science created over the preceding five decades.|$|E

Thomas Friedman, in his recent book, The World is Flat, explains this trend in terms of brain drain, whereby the <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>brightest</b> elements in India emigrate to the U.S. in order to seek better financial opportunities. A joint study by Duke University and UC Berkeley revealed that Indian immigrants to the US have founded more engineering and technology companies from 1995 to 2005 than immigrants from the UK, China, Taiwan and Japan combined. A 1999 study by AnnaLee Saxenian reported {{that a third of}} Silicon Valley scientists and engineers were immigrants and that Indians are the second largest group of Asian-born engineers (23%) following the Chinese (51%). Her research showed that in 1998, seven percent of high-technology firms in Silicon Valley were led by Indian CEOs. A recent study shows that 23% of Indian business school graduates take a job in United States.|$|E

25|$|Warrior Nun Areala is a manga-style American {{comic book}} {{character}} created by Ben Dunn {{and published by}} Antarctic Press, first appearing in Warrior Nun Areala Vol. 1 #1 in December 1994. The story revolves around Sister Shannon Masters, a Joan of Arc like heroine of the Order of the Cruciform Sword, a fictional military order of Warrior Nuns and Magic Priests in service of the Catholic Church. The order was created in 1066 when a Valkyrie named Auria renounced her pagan ways and turned to Jesus Christ for salvation; ever since then, Auria, now Areala, has chosen an avatar every generation {{to carry on the}} mission. In modern times, this has grown to a world spanning organization {{in the service of the}} Catholic Church with the current Areala, Sister Shannon Masters as the <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>brightest.</b> With her friends beside her, Sister Shannon has led the forces of good against those of evil, ever serving the Lord with faith and humility.

[...] He suggested {{that there should be}} a focus on [...] "creative spontaneity", expressing the view that the education system in 2002 was one that focused on churning out a production line of workers, managers and instruction takers. Given that Singapore had reached the standards of a First World economy, Singapore should focus on instilling an inquisitive spirit within students, to encourage students to ask questions. He placed most emphasis on the importance of ensuring that the focus of education should be character building, stating: [...] "It will be failure of our education system if we are to train our <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>brightest</b> with our best resources only to be told that they are going to be the quitters of our society; or that they lack the compassion for the weak and the down; or that they behave in a snobbish class of their own; or behave condescendingly to their peers and followers; or that the elites only care about their own self-interests." ...|$|E
