5|$|Feminist {{campaigns are}} {{generally}} considered to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender neutrality in English, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including bell hooks, argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims <b>because</b> <b>men</b> are also harmed by traditional gender roles.|$|E
5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes {{are a sign}} of a patriarchal {{organization}} <b>because</b> <b>men</b> are only forbidden from growing their hair long or wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E
5|$|The Poveiro is a {{specific}} genre of boat characterized by a wide flat-bottom and a deep helm. There were diverse boats with different sizes, uses and shapes. The most notable of which, the Lancha Poveira, {{was believed to be}} derived from the Drakkar Viking, but without a long stern and bow and with a lateen sail. Each boat carried carvings, namely a sigla poveira mark for boat identification and magical-religious protection at sea. According to a tradition that persists to this day, the youngest son is the heir of the family, as in old Brittany and Denmark, because it was expected that he would take care of his parents when they became old. Women govern the family, <b>because</b> <b>men</b> were usually away from home fishing.|$|E

5|$|Under Confucianism {{the typical}} family was patriarchal <b>because</b> <b>men</b> had the {{capability}} {{to pass on the}} family name and carry on the lineage of the ancestors; women were expected to be subservient. Adoption of Western family values in the twentieth century challenged traditional Chinese values. Nationalism contributed to the changes of customs and status of women. Nationalist revolutionary Qiu Jin promoted feminism through various essays and speeches, as well as through her Chinese Women's Journal. Jin chastised wife beating, female infanticide, arranged marriages, and foot binding. She eventually began teaching at a girls' school. Around this time, many other schools for girls opened in China. This led to increased job opportunities for women in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Eddie {{continues}} to persuade his superiors {{to form a}} task force to hunt down the Flash, expressing his zero tolerance for vigilantes. When an enraged and jealous Barry, as Flash, makes an attempt on Eddie, Oliver tries to stop Barry, and the two engage in a fight. Oliver manages to wrangle Barry long enough for Harrison Wells and Joe to use colored strobe light to reset Barry's emotional state. Afterward, Barry and Oliver capture Bivolo and place him in the prison at S.T.A.R. Labs. Due to the incident, Eddie gets the grounds to form a police task force to arrest the Flash. Barry confirms Oliver's belief that the former has a lot to learn. Oliver advises him to stay away from Iris West, with whom Barry is in love, <b>because</b> <b>men</b> with secret identities never get the girl. Oliver asks Team Flash to keep his alter ego a secret. A new metahuman able to manipulate fire appears in Central City.|$|E
5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. <b>Because</b> <b>men</b> typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men and women who have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E

25|$|Mayer's partner, Steve Hooks, {{found the}} bite mark unusual, as bites during struggles are more {{commonly}} inflicted by women, while most burglars are men. However, <b>because</b> <b>men</b> have bitten opponents during fights as well, the burglary theory stood.|$|E
25|$|The average {{official}} {{salary in}} 2011 was equivalent to $US2 per month while the actual monthly income {{seems to be}} around $US15 because most North Koreans earn money from illegal small businesses: trade, subsistence farming, and handicrafts.

60|$|It is {{only because}} such a vast {{section of the}} modern world is out of sympathy with the serious {{democratic}} sentiment that this statement will seem to many to be lacking in seriousness. Democracy is not philanthropy; it is not even altruism or social reform. Democracy is not founded on pity for the common man; democracy is founded on reverence for the common man, or, if you will, even on fear of him. It does not champion <b>man</b> <b>because</b> <b>man</b> is so miserable, but <b>because</b> <b>man</b> is so sublime. It does not object so much to the ordinary man being a slave as to his not being a king, for its dream is always the dream of the first Roman republic, a nation of kings.|$|R
25|$|Approximately {{twice as}} many women as men are {{prescribed}} benzodiazepines. It is believed that this is largely <b>because</b> <b>men</b> typically turned to alcohol to cope with stress and women to prescription drugs. Biased perception of women by male doctors may {{also play a role}} in increased prescribing rates to women; however, increased anxiety features in women does not account for the wide gap alone between men and women.|$|E
25|$|The {{equality}} {{of men and}} women is a fundamental Bahá'í principle, that is explicit in the writings of Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, and particularly in the writings and discourses of `Abdu'l-Bahá, his son and chosen interpreter. The teaching and its vision of the community is central to Bahá'í community life as is implemented at a practical level. The Bahá'í teachings state that women are not inferior to men, and should not be subordinate to men in aspects of social life. In the Bahá'í view, women have always been equal to men, and the reason why women have so far not achieved this equality is {{due to the lack of}} adequate educational and social opportunities, and <b>because</b> <b>men</b> have used their greater physical strength to prevent women from developing their true potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{books of}} those that wrote before us survive, and {{therefore}} we are taught about what was written then. For this reason it is good that we also in our time, here among us, write some material from scratch, inspired by the example of these old customs; so that it might, when we are dead and elsewhere, {{be left to the}} world's ear in the time coming after this. But <b>because</b> <b>men</b> say, and it's true, that when someone writes entirely about wisdom, it often dulls a man's wit who reads it every day. For that reason, if you permit it, I would like to take the middle way, and write a book between the two, somewhat of passion, somewhat of instruction, that whether of high or low status, people may like what I write about.|$|E
2500|$|This, {{says the}} Zohar, is {{indicated}} in the words [...] "for the Lord God had not caused it to rain" [...] (Gen. 2:5), which means that there {{had not yet been}} beneficent action in heaven, <b>because</b> <b>man</b> had not yet been created to pray for it.|$|R

5|$|A case {{somewhat}} similar to Batesian mimicry {{is that of}} mimetic weeds, which imitate agricultural crops. In weed or Vavilovian mimicry, the weed survives by having seeds which winnowing machinery identifies as belonging to the crop. Vavilovian mimicry is not Batesian, <b>because</b> <b>man</b> and crop are not enemies.|$|R

Freeman's character alludes to the choice when queried by Andy on why he is called Red, replying [...] "Maybe it's because I'm Irish." [...] Freeman opted not to research his role, saying [...] "acting the part of someone who's incarcerated doesn't require any specific knowledge of incarceration ... <b>because</b> <b>men</b> don't change.

500|$|She was {{involved}} by being [...] "the {{eyes and the}} ears" [...] of the New Deal. She looked to the future and was committed to social reform. One of those programs helped working women receive better wages. The New Deal also placed women into less machine work and more white collar work. Women {{did not have to}} work in the factories making war supplies <b>because</b> <b>men</b> were coming home so they could take over the long days and nights women had been working to contribute to the war efforts. Roosevelt brought unprecedented activism and ability {{to the role of the}} First Lady.|$|E
2500|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} [...] "The desire for God {{is written in}} the human heart, <b>because</b> <b>man</b> is created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw man to himself." [...] While man may turn away from God, God never stops calling man back to him. <b>Because</b> <b>man</b> is created in the image and {{likeness}} of God, man can know with certainty of God's existence from his own human reason. But while [...] "Man's faculties make him capable of coming to {{a knowledge of the}} existence of a personal God," [...] in order [...] "for man to be able to enter into real intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to man, and to give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith." ...|$|R

60|$|The actions we call sinful are as {{much the}} {{consequence}} {{of the order of}} nature as those we call virtuous.

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{states that}} {{currently}} {{many women are}} silly and superficial (she refers to them, for example, as [...] "spaniels" [...] and [...] "toys"), but argues {{that this is not}} because of an innate deficiency of mind but rather <b>because</b> <b>men</b> have denied them access to education. Wollstonecraft is intent on illustrating the limitations that women's deficient educations have placed on them; she writes: [...] "Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison." [...] She implies that, without the encouragement young women receive from an early age to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, women could achieve much more.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} book (ch. 52–57), Rabelais writes of this Abbey of Thélème, built by the giant Gargantua. It is a {{classical}} utopia presented in order to critique and assess {{the state of the}} society of Rabelais's day, as opposed to a modern utopian text that seeks to create the scenario in practice. [...] It is a utopia where people's desires are more fulfilled. [...] Satirical, it also epitomises the ideals considered in Rabelais's fiction. [...] The inhabitants of the abbey were governed only by their own free will and pleasure, the only rule being [...] "Do What Thou Wilt". Rabelais believed that men who are free, well born and bred have honour, which intrinsically leads to virtuous actions. When constrained, their noble natures turn instead to remove their servitude, <b>because</b> <b>men</b> desire what they are denied.|$|E
500|$|Clement's umpiring career lasted six years, {{during which}} she officiated games in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska. [...] Unlike in modern games, during Clement's time games only had one umpire, who stood behind the pitcher and was {{responsible}} for calling strikes and balls, whether balls were fair or foul, and whether runners reached bases safely. Despite the danger umpires faced during this era Clement was treated respectfully by both players and fans, and became respected for her serious style and because she was insusceptible to bribery. Her popularity was so high that baseball marketers emphasized her officiating of games to bring in crowds. In 1906 Clement wrote an editorial for the Cincinnati Enquirer arguing that women made better umpires than men <b>because</b> <b>men</b> would not speak abusively towards female umpires. She would repeat this idea in interviews with other newspapers. Clement, a Congregationalist, refused to umpire on Sundays and stayed {{in the homes of}} clergymen while umpiring on the road.|$|E
50|$|On {{one side}} of the quarrel, many argued that women were {{inferior}} to <b>men</b> <b>because</b> <b>man</b> was created by God first, and were therefore stronger and more important.
