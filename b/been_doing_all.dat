25|$|The IRA gave clear {{reasons for}} the execution. I think {{it is unfortunate that}} anyone has to be killed, but the furor created by Mountbatten's death showed up the hypocritical {{attitude}} of the media establishment. As a member of the House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> his life to other people; and with his war record I don't think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in coming to this country. In my opinion, the IRA achieved its objective: people started paying attention to what was happening in Ireland.|$|E
500|$|On September 12, {{the explorers}} {{resigned}} themselves to wintering {{on the ice}} and camped on a large floe, letting the ice take them where it would, [...] "which", writes Kjellström, [...] "it had really <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> along" [...] (p.47). Drifting rapidly due south towards Kvitøya, they hurriedly built a winter [...] "home" [...] on the floe against the increasing cold, with walls made of water-reinforced snow to Strindberg's design (see plan, below, left). Observing the rapidity of their drift, Andrée recorded his hopes that they might get far enough south to feed themselves entirely from the sea. However, the floe began to break up directly under the hut on October 2 from the stresses of pressing against Kvitøya, and they were forced to bring their stores on to the island itself, which took a couple of days. [...] "Morale remains good", reports Andrée {{at the very end of}} the coherent part of his diary, which ends: [...] "Med sådana kamrater bör man kunna reda sig under snart sagdt hvilka omständigheter som helst." [...] ("With such comrades one should be able to manage under, I may say, any circumstances".) It is inferred from the incoherent and badly damaged last pages of Andrée's diary that the three men were all dead within a few days of moving onto the island.|$|E

2500|$|Lee Min Choon, {{legal adviser}} to the CFM and the National Evangelical Christian Fellowship issued a {{statement}} which said [...] "It means that churches can celebrate Christmas as they have <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> along.

[...] "Now, everybody should take the government at its word and celebrate Christmas the way they normally celebrate and express their religious faith." ...|$|E

[...] Soon, however, all the ladies arrive, having risked the long sea voyage from Venice – they could no longer stand the separation. In delight, the reunited couples have a magnificent banquet and a dance (a cachucha).|$|E

2500|$|Bored with school, Tall Chief devoted {{herself to}} dance in Belcher's studio. In {{addition}} to ballet, {{which she had}} previously <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> wrong {{and went back to}} square one, she learned tap, Spanish dancing, and acrobatics there. She found tumbling very difficult, and eventually quit the class, but later in life put the skills to good use. The family moved to Beverly Hills where schools offered better academics. At Beverly Vista School, Tall Chief experienced what she described as [...] "painful" [...] discrimination and took to spelling her last name as one word, Tallchief. She continued to study piano, appearing as a guest soloist with small symphony orchestras throughout high school.|$|E
2500|$|For Season 2, Koenig {{teamed up}} with Mark Boal, the Academy Award winning screenwriter of The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, and his {{production}} company, Page 1. Boal had {{conducted a series of}} interviews with Bergdahl as part of a film production he was working on, and both Boal and Bergdahl gave Koenig permission to use those excerpts of those recorded interviews in episodes of Serial. As Koenig stated in Season 2's first episode: [...] "They'd come to us saying 'hey, we've <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> this reporting on the story, and we've also got this tape. Do you think you might want to listen?' And yes, we did, and we were kind of blown away, and so we began working with them. They shared their research with us, and also put us in touch with many of their sources... We don't {{have anything to do with}} their movie, but Mark and Page 1 are our partners for Season 2." ...|$|E
