40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of antimicrobial resistance data largely focuses on individual antimicrobial’s binaryoutcome (susceptible or resistant). However, bacteria {{are becoming increasingly}} multidrug resistant (MDR). Statistical {{analysis of}} MDR data is mostly descriptive often with tabular or graphical presentations. Here we report the applicability of generalized ordinal logistic regression model {{for the analysis of}} MDR data. A total of 1, 152 Escherichia coli, isolated from the feces of weaned pigs experimentally supplemented with chlortetracycline (CTC) and copper, were tested for susceptibilities against 15 antimicrobials and were <b>binary</b> <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> resistant or susceptible. The 15 antimicrobial agents tested were grouped into eight different antimicrobial classes. We defined MDR as the number of antimicrobial classes to which E. coli isolates were resistant ranging from 0 to 8. Proportionality of the odds assumption of the ordinal logistic regression model was violated only for the effect of treatment period (pre-treatment,during-treatment and post-treatment); but not for the effect of CTC or copper supplementation. Subsequently, a partially constrained generalized ordinal logistic model was built that allows for the effect of treatment period to vary while constraining the effects of treatment (CTC and copper supplementation) to be constant across the levels of MDR classes. Copper (Proportional Odds Ratio [Prop OR] = 1. 03; 95 %CI = 0. 73 – 1. 47) and CTC (Prop OR = 1. 1; 95 % CI = 0. 78 – 1. 56) supplementation were not significantly associated with the level of MDR adjusted for the effect of treatment period. MDR generally declined over the trial period. In conclusion, generalized ordered logistic regression can be used for the analysis of ordinal data such as MDR data when the proportionality assumptions for ordered logistic regression are violated...|$|E

50|$|The above {{definitions}} are <b>binary,</b> <b>classifying</b> nations <b>into</b> either democracies or non-democracies. Many {{researchers have}} instead used more finely grained scales. One {{example is the}} Polity data series which scores each state on two scales, one for democracy and one for autocracy, for each year since 1800; {{as well as several}} others. The use of the Polity Data has varied. Some researchers have done correlations between the democracy scale and belligerence; others have treated it as a binary classification by (as its maker does) calling all states with a high democracy score and a low autocracy score democracies; yet others have used the difference of the two scores, sometimes again making this into a binary classification (Gleditsch 1992).|$|R
25|$|<b>Binary</b> {{stars are}} <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> four types {{according}} {{to the way in}} which they are observed: visually, by observation; spectroscopically, by periodic changes in spectral lines; photometrically, by changes in brightness caused by an eclipse; or astrometrically, by measuring a deviation in a star's position caused by an unseen companion. Any binary star can belong to several of these classes; for example, several spectroscopic binaries are also eclipsing binaries.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of black}} hole X-ray <b>binaries</b> can be <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> five spectral states which are {{defined in terms}} of the X-ray spectral and timing properties of the source. These states show distinct and observable characteristics and transitions from one state to another often take place. Perhaps the most interesting of the five is the low/hard state; in theis state the X-ray emission appears to be confined to a Comptonising corona surrounding the black hole, the optical and infrared emission comes from a cold accretion disc with a large inner disc radius and a weak continuious jet is emitted from the central regions of the disc. In this thesis I study three black hole candidates which show low/hard state behaviour either most of the time (Cygnus X- 1), quasi-periodically (LMC X- 3) or intermittently (GS 1351 - 64). Observations were taken at X-ray, radio and optical wavelengths in order to study the preoperties of the low/hard state and the relationship between the accretion disc and the jet...|$|R

For example, which brand is best for certain product, whether the current movie is good, whether product gives better performance or not etc. Opinion mining, also known as Sentiment analysis {{plays an important role}} in this process. It is the study of emotions i. e. Sentiments, Expressions that are stated in natural language. Natural language techniques are applied to extract emotions from unstructured data. There are several techniques used to analyse data such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning and hybrid techniques. The <b>binary</b> classification <b>classifies</b> data <b>into</b> two subclasses viz. positive and negative. The positive class shows a good opinion and negative class shows the bad decision opinion.

40|$|Nowadays, the significative improments {{of remote}} sensing images have offered a better {{representation}} of intra-urban morphological patterns. However, high spatial resolution images {{have a great}} number of spectral noise, difficulting the discrimination of image objects. The analysis of image textural information is an alternative to minimize this problem. In this context, this paper verifies the capabilities of CBERS- 2 imagens on the differentiation of morphological patterns between areas with different inhabitability conditions. Initially, the spectral information of a CBERS- 2 image are enhanced and <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> two groups: occupied and non-occupied spaces. Then, the textural information of the <b>binary</b> <b>classified</b> image are calculated through a sliding box algorithm. Finally, the lacunarity values obtained are compared with values of a Inhabitability Index (IH) created from Census 2000 variables. The results show that, in general, non-occupied spaces are bettter distributed in urban areas with higher inhabitability conditions. Pages: 769 - 77...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the problem of finding the largest single-deletion-correcting code for binary strings. The Varshamov-Tenengolts construction <b>classifies</b> <b>binary</b> strings <b>into</b> non-overlapping sets, the largest set of these is asymptotically the largest singledeletion-correcting code. However despite the asymptotic optimality {{little is known about}} the quality of the construction as a function of the string length. We show that these sets are also responsible for the (near) solution of several combinatorial problems on a certain hypergraph. Furthermore our results are valid for any string length. We show that the sets collectively solve strong vertex coloring and edge coloring on the hypergraph exactly. For any string length n we show that the largest of these sets is within n+ 1 /n- 1 of optimal matching on the hypergraph, which also corresponds to the largest single-deletion-correcting code. Moreover, we show for any n the smallest of these sets is within n(2) -n/n(2) - 3 n+ 4 - 4 / 2 (n) of the smallest cover of this hypergraph and that each of these sets is a perfect matching. We then obtain similar results on the dual of this hypergraph. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} V-band photometric light curve modeling of 30 eclipsing binaries using {{the data from}} Pietrukowicz et al. (2009) collected with the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope (ESO VLT) of diameter 8 -m. The light curve of these 30 eclipsing binaries were selected out of 148 of them available in the database {{on the basis of}} complete phase coverage, regular and smooth phased light curve shapes. Eclipsing binaries play pivotal role in the direct measurement of astronomical distances more accurately simply from their geometry of light curves. The accurate value of Hubble constant (H 0) which measures the rate of expansion of the Universe heavily relies on extragalactic distance scale measurements. Classification of the selected binary stars in the sample were done, preliminarily on the basis of Fourier parameters in the a 2 -a 4 plane and final classification was obtained from the Roche lobe geometry. Out of these 30 eclipsing binaries, only one was found to be detached binary system while the rest 29 of them belong to the contact binary systems. These contact <b>binaries</b> were further <b>classified</b> <b>into</b> the A-type and W-type based on their mass ratios. Since spectroscopic mass ratio measurements were not available for any of these binary stars, we determined the mass ratios through photometric light curve modeling with the aid of Wilson-Devinney code as implemented in PHOEBE. Various geometrical parameters and physical parameters of astrophysical importance viz., mass, radius and luminosity were obtained from the light curves of the selected stars.

40|$|<b>Binary</b> tests <b>classify</b> items <b>into</b> two {{categories}} such as reject/accept, positive/negative or guilty/innocent. A binary test’s proneness to measurement error is usually {{expressed in terms of}} the misclassification probabilities FAP (false acceptance probability) and FRP (false rejection probability). The thesis studies the estimation of these probabilities under the common complication of an unavailable gold standard or reference standard, meaning that the "true value" of an item cannot be obtained. Various methods based on latent variable modeling have been proposed to deal with this situation. However, there is sufficient reason to doubt the reliability of these methods. In this thesis, the reliability of these methods is put to the test. A mathematical exploration provides formal proof that, without a gold standard, FAP and FRP can only be estimated with unrealistically strict assumptions. A simulation study shows that small deviations from these strict assumptions are likely to lead to large biases in estimates of FAP and FRP. Moreover, this thesis shows that binary measurement error can be decomposed in a systematic and a random component, and that only the latter can be estimated without a gold standard. This is well known for numerical measurements, but a new insight for the non-numerical case. The random component of binary measurement error can be quantified by means of the probabilities of inconsistent classification IAP and IRP. A robust method of estimating these quantities is provided and evaluated in a simulation study. The final chapter generalizes the findings to nominal scales with more than two classes...|$|R
