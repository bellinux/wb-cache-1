Drake, Ann Druyan, Timothy Ferris, Jon Lomberg, and Linda Salzman. A CD-ROM version was issued by Warner New Media in 1992. The CD-ROM was the result of Sagan's diligence in obtaining copyright clearances for many of the numerous musical passages and photographs that the original Golden Record contained, to allow for their inclusion in the Warner New Media release. Author Ann Druyan, who later married Carl Sagan, wrote about the Voyager Record in the epilogue of Sagan's final book <b>Billions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Billions.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{announced}} at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International on July 25, 2009, by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane. It was written by fellow executive producer and series regular Danny Smith and directed by Joseph Lee, during the show's eighth production season. The storyline was pitched by series regular Tom Devanney, and periodically references <b>Billions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Billions</b> (1997), a book of essays by Carl Sagan. [...] Seth MacFarlane asked Danny Smith to read Sagan's essay, [...] "Abortion: Is It Possible to Be Both 'Pro-Life' and 'Pro-Choice'", before beginning to write the script. The episode was originally intended to air {{along with the rest}} of the eighth season schedule, and was approved for production by 20th Century Fox. However, the Fox Broadcasting Company asserted their right not to air the episode due to the subject matter. This was the second time that MacFarlane had been warned by Fox about the sensitive nature of an episode's subject. Previously, the network had also disapproved of the season 3 episode [...] "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein", which was originally prevented from airing on Fox, but finally aired on Adult Swim, and eventually on Fox more than four years after it was rejected. Thinking the same would happen with [...] "Partial Terms of Endearment", MacFarlane believed that Fox would eventually run the episode on their network, stating, [...] "Most of the time these things turn out to be nothing." [...] In a statement released by Fox, they noted their full support of [...] "the producers' right to make the episode and distribute it in whatever way they want." ...|$|E

On May 24, 2011, the Institute for Policy Studies {{came out with a}} new report ranking various spent fuel sites and contending that spent nuclear reactor fuel needs to be moved en masse into safer dry cask storage rather than the current liquid pool system. However, Harry Reid brushed aside such remarks with the contention that transport to a central site increases risks. [...] "Leave it on-site where it is," [...] he said last year. [...] "You don't have to worry about transporting it. Saves the country <b>billions</b> <b>and</b> <b>billions</b> of dollars.

I have had letters from them since, but it is such broken English I can't make it out.

The plan proposes that ordinary voters {{would be able to}} profit from any increase in the value of their shares once the Treasury has recouped taxpayers’ money used for the bail-out - an offer that could eventually be worth up to £1,000 to householders. Clegg said that it was [...] "psychologically immensely important" [...] for people to be given a stake in the banks {{in the wake of the}} financial crisis. [...] "Their money has been used to the tune of <b>billions</b> <b>and</b> <b>billions</b> <b>and</b> <b>billions</b> to keep the British banking system on a life-support system," [...] he said.
