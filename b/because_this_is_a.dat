25|$|Because a large {{proportion}} of stars exist in binary systems, binaries are particularly important {{to our understanding of the}} processes by which stars form. In particular, the period and masses of the binary tell us about the amount of angular momentum in the system. <b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> conserved quantity in physics, binaries give us important clues about the conditions under which the stars were formed.|$|E

25|$|While talking out {{a measure}} {{is the most}} common form of {{filibuster}} in the Senate, other means of delaying and killing legislation are available. Because the Senate routinely conducts business by unanimous consent, one member can create at least some delay by objecting to the request. In some cases, such as considering a bill or resolution on the day it is introduced or brought from the House, the delay can be as long as a day. However, <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> legislative day, not a calendar day, the majority can mitigate it by briefly adjourning.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} {{of a new}} life means changing and adapting. Beginning freshmen enter a new phase that affects the way they eat. They are unaware of their nutrition and they only want something from what they see. High school {{is very different from}} what college is. Students transition from being in small classroom into big lecture rooms. The same goes for food, they transition from being served in cafeterias to buffet styles in college. Dining centers excite new students <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> new experience, therefore they grab more than what they should. It’s something new and it’s what they’re paying for.|$|E

25|$|Geologists {{searching for}} oil in Alaska in 1953 {{observed}} that in Lituya Bay, mature tree growth did not extend to the shoreline {{as it did in}} many other bays in the region. Rather, there was a band of younger trees closer to the shore. Forestry workers, glaciologists, and geographers call the boundary between these bands a trim line. Trees just above the trim line showed severe scarring on their seaward side, whilst those from below the trim line did not. The scientists hypothesized that there had been an unusually large wave or waves in the deep inlet. <b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> recently deglaciated fjord with steep slopes and crossed by a major fault, one possibility was a landslide-generated tsunami.|$|E
25|$|Filing a claim {{with the}} Court of Federal Claims {{requires}} a $250 filing fee, {{which can be}} waived for those unable to pay. Medical records such as prenatal, birth, pre-vaccination, vaccination, and post-vaccination records are strongly suggested, as medical review and claim processing may be delayed without them. <b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> legal process most people use a lawyer, though this is not required. By 1999 the average claim took two years to resolve, and 42% of resolved claims were awarded compensation, as compared with 23% for medical malpractice claims through the tort system. There is a three-year statute of limitations for filing a claim, timed from the first manifestation of the medical problem.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} The Times Literary Supplement commented, [...] "this {{is a most}} informative, candid and {{valuable}} book". Writing in Quill, published by the Society of Professional Journalists, Robert Vaughn Young commented, [...] "Perhaps <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sociological study of Scientology, this is a cold, calm, academic dissection of the subject and Hubbard." [...] The California Court of Appeal cited the book as a reference in a decision relating to a criminal defendant {{who was a member}} of Scientology. When Wallis died in 1990, his obituary in The Independent noted that The Road to Total Freedom [...] "still stands as a classic of good field research".|$|E

I found it very exciting. So the first time I read it, I was just reading it for enjoyment, really, because it was so well-written and exciting.

Music said, [...] "You can forgive Cyrus's lack of poetic profundity <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{dancefloor}} smash complete with ecstatic beats pummelling throughout." [...] Along with [...] "7 Things", Robert Christgau called the song [...] "one {{of the best}} of Breakout". Ben Ratliff wrote for The New York Times that [...] "Breakout" [...] "appeals to both age groups", adding, [...] "it’s a girls-only call to fun, but it hints at a decadent, school-free future." [...] However, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described [...] "Breakout" [...] as a [...] "noxious Avril Lavigne knockoff— an anti-education screed filled with declarations".|$|E

I was very surprised and very happy when I got a phone call on Sunday to say that something could be happening here ... Dropping into League One isn't a worry for me <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> club on the up and I didn't want to be stuck at Stoke just picking my money up because that isn't me" [...] On 18 June 2013, having made sufficient first-team appearances for Sheffield United, Higginbotham activated a clause in his contract to extend it for the following season.|$|E

500|$|After an {{undisclosed}} financial settlement was agreed Mills left Alfreton {{to return to}} Tamworth, who at this time were in the Conference National, for a second spell as manager on 26 January 2007. He joined with the team 24th in the table and following his appointment he said: [...] "It feels fantastic to be back. It is an amazing football club {{that means a lot}} to me". He was in charge for the home match against Crawley Town the day after his appointment, the visitors winning 1–0 with a 54th minute Mark Wright goal. Mills was unable to keep Tamworth up, the club being relegated to the Conference North with a 22nd-place finish in the Conference National. He stated his determination to get the club back up, saying: [...] "The disappointment will go away <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> great football club to be at. We all need to stay proud and positive and I will now prepare a squad for the start of next season." [...] Tamworth spent most of 2007–08 in midtable, eventually finishing 15th in the Conference North; the Tamworth Herald claimed it was [...] "among the poorest campaigns in the club's history".|$|E
