50|$|On {{the basis}} of her suit’s success, other tribes {{throughout}} California began fighting for recognition and restoration by the federal government. Though there had been 6 termination reversals prior to Tillie Hardwick v. United States none had as far reaching an effect.

5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with rechargeable batteries that can <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E

Hiding their ship in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park using its {{cloaking}} device, the crew split up to accomplish several tasks: Admiral James T.

Uhura and Pavel Chekov are tasked to find a nuclear reactor, whose energy leakage will enable their ship's power to <b>be</b> <b>restored.</b>|$|E

5|$|Computers may be {{impacted}} by volcanic ash, with their functionality and usability decreasing during ashfall, {{but it is}} unlikely they will completely fail. The most vulnerable components are the mechanical components, such as cooling fans, cd drives, keyboard, mice and touch pads. These components can become jammed with fine grained ash causing them to cease working; however, most can <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> to working order by cleaning with compressed air. Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.|$|E

If a companion has their health reduced to zero they die permanently.|$|E

5|$|Georges Dumézil {{theorized that}} Víðarr {{represents}} a cosmic figure from an archetype {{derived from the}} Proto-Indo-Europeans. Dumézil stated that he was aligned with both vertical space, due to his placement of {{his foot on the}} wolf's lower jaw and his hand on the wolf's upper jaw, and horizontal space, due to his wide step and strong shoe, and that, by killing the wolf, Víðarr keeps the wolf from destroying the cosmos, and the cosmos can thereafter <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> after the destruction resulting from Ragnarök.|$|E

Henry II of France, engaged in war against the Habsburgs, also urged Isabella {{to return to}} Hungary, promising one of his daughters in marriage to John Sigismund.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} stages of development, {{hitherto}} unknown information contained within undamaged DNA would be enough to bring others back from the dead including their memories and personality. This would be done by taking a small sample from someone's body and preserving it at the time when the level of the brain's efficiency and knowledge is highest. On the day of death, a cell would be taken from the sample for the cloning to take place, and the memories and personality would <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> to their peak level.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the riot}} {{appeared}} to increase {{public support for}} radical reform of the present degrading prison system. Some of that goodwill will have been eroded by the antics of the rioters {{in the last two}} weeks, and may be further eroded once details emerge during the forthcoming criminal prosecutions. But this must not deflect Home Office ministers from the road down which they had belatedly begun to travel. A change in prison conditions is crucial if good order is to <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> to the system.|$|E
