5|$|Since cats were venerated {{in ancient}} Egypt, they were {{commonly}} {{believed to have}} been domesticated there, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7,500 BC). A genetic study in 2007 concluded that all domestic cats are descended from Near Eastern wildcats, having diverged around 8,000 BC in the Middle East. A 2016 study found that leopard cats were undergoing domestication independently in China around 5,500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domesticated populations of today. A 2017 study confirmed that domestic cats are descendants of those first domesticated by farmers in the Near East around 9,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have short {{antennae}} {{and several}} simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles {{and a pair}} maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk. Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration {{in the form of}} hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development in the egg stage.|$|E
5|$|The fur is {{brownish}} (T.bolivaris) or reddish (T.talamancae) {{above and}} lighter below, appearing whitish, but {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray bases. The snout is large. The mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae both extend to at least the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head, but are much longer in T.bolivaris. The pinna (external ear) is large. On the hindfeet, which are long and narrow, ungual tufts of hairs surround the bases of the toes. In T.bolivaris, the sole usually entirely lacks squamae (small, scale-like structures), but T.talamancae does have squamae on part of its sole. The claw of the first toe extends about {{to the middle of}} the first phalange of the second and that of the fifth toe extends nearly to the base of the second phalange of the fourth. The tail is at least about as long as the head and body, sometimes slightly longer. The tail is darker above than below in T.talamancae, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> not be a difference in color in T.bolivaris. The tail appears naked, but is covered with fine hairs.|$|E

5|$|The war {{came to a}} {{disastrous}} end in 1828, as Brazil relinquished Cisplatina, which became the independent nation of Uruguay. Nonetheless, Luís Alves was promoted {{to the rank of}} major on 2 December 1828 and made second-in-command of the Emperor's Battalion in early 1829. During his stay in Montevideo, he met María Ángela Furriol González Luna. How far their relationship progressed is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> have been a failed engagement. He returned to Rio de Janeiro and witnessed the increasing deterioration in Emperor PedroI's political position. A growing opposition to PedroI's policies eventually erupted into mass protests at the Field of Santana in downtown Rio de Janeiro on 6 April 1831. The situation became more ominous when several military units, led by Luís Alves' father and uncles, joined the protests.|$|E

25|$|Romanesque doorways have a {{character}} form, with the jambs having {{a series of}} receding planes, into {{each of which is}} set a circular shaft, all surmounted by a continuous abacus. The semi-circular arch which rises from the abacus has the same seried planes and circular mouldings as the jambs. There are typically four planes containing three shafts, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be as many as twelve shafts, symbolic of the apostles.|$|E
25|$|Each side of {{the pelvis}} is formed as cartilage, which ossifies as three main bones which stay {{separate}} through childhood: ilium, ischium, pubis. At birth {{the whole of the}} hip joint (the acetabulum area and the top of the femur) is still made of cartilage (<b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be a small piece of bone in the great trochanter of the femur); this makes it difficult to detect congenital hip dislocation by X-raying.|$|E

25|$|The gallows {{stood on}} the site of St. Mark's Church not far from Oval tube station.

In total 129 men and 12 women were executed at Kennington <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> well have been others. The first person was Sarah Elston who was burned at the stake for the killing her husband on 24 April 1678. The last person executed was a forger on 5 August 1799.|$|E
25|$|In a {{meta-analysis}} of 88 studies, drinking soda correlates with {{a decrease in}} milk consumption along with the vitamin D, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, calcium, protein and other micronutrients. Phosphorus, a micronutrient, {{can be found in}} cola-type beverages, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be a risk in consuming too much. Phosphorus and calcium are used in the body to create calcium-phosphate, which is the main component of bone. However, the combination of too much phosphorus with too little calcium in the body can lead to a degeneration of bone mass.|$|E
25|$|There must be {{at least}} one sekiwake and komusubi {{on each side of the}} banzuke, {{normally}} two total, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be more. Although there is usually a yokozuna there is no requirement for one, and it has sometimes happened that no active yokozuna or no ōzeki were listed in the ranks. If there is more than one yokozuna but only one ōzeki, the lower rank will be filled out by designating one of the yokozuna as yokozuna-ōzeki. There is no recorded instance of there being fewer than two yokozuna and ōzeki in total.|$|E

25|$|Second-generation fuels require either higher {{confinement}} temperatures {{or longer}} confinement time than those required of first-generation fusion fuels, but generate fewer neutrons. Neutrons are an unwanted byproduct of fusion reactions in an energy generation context, {{because they are}} absorbed by {{the walls of a}} fusion chamber, making them radioactive. They cannot be confined by magnetic fields, because they are not electrically charged. This group consists of deuterium and helium-3. The products are all charged particles, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be significant side reactions leading to the production of neutrons.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{cause of}} aphthous {{stomatitis}} is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be a genetic predisposition in some people. Other possible causes include hematinic deficiency (folate, vitamin B, iron), stopping smoking, stress, menstruation, trauma, food allergies or hypersensitivity to {{sodium lauryl sulphate}} (found in many brands of toothpaste). Aphthous stomatitis has no clinically detectable signs or symptoms outside the mouth, but the recurrent ulceration can cause much discomfort to sufferers. Treatment is aimed at reducing the pain and swelling and speeding healing, and may involve systemic or topical steroids, analgesics (pain killers), antiseptics, anti-inflammatories or barrier pastes to protect the raw area(s).|$|E
25|$|The town of Opotiki is {{situated}} exactly on latitude 38° South. The climate is temperate. Summer temperatures reach the mid-20s (Celsius, mid-70s Fahrenheit) {{on the coast}} and encourage {{a continuation of the}} beach culture of the Bay of Plenty. Winter days are often cloudless, the daytime temperature never drops below freezing <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be a mild frost at night. Winter snow falls along the crest of the ranges, and on the higher peaks (over 1000 m) may remain for a few weeks. Rain occurs at any season. Severe localised rainstorms ('cloudbursts') may occur in the high country and have caused flash flooding including past inundations of Opotiki township.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, a graph may be {{embedded}} in space {{in such a}} way that, for each cycle in the graph, one can find a disk bounded by that cycle that does not cross any other feature of the graph. In this case, the cycle must be unlinked from all the other cycles disjoint from it in the graph. The embedding is said to be flat if every cycle bounds a disk in this way. A flat embedding is necessarily linkless, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> exist linkless embeddings that are not flat: for instance, if G is a graph formed by two disjoint cycles, and it is embedded to form the Whitehead link, then the embedding is linkless but not flat.|$|E
25|$|Like the Doric Order, the Ionic Order retains {{signs of}} having {{its origins in}} wooden architecture. The {{horizontal}} spread of a flat timber plate {{across the top of}} a column is a common device in wooden construction, giving a thin upright a wider area on which to bear the lintel, {{while at the same time}} reinforcing the load-bearing strength of the lintel itself. Likewise, the columns always have bases, a necessity in wooden architecture to spread the load and protect the base of a comparatively thin upright. The columns are fluted with narrow, shallow flutes that do not meet at a sharp edge but have a flat band or fillet between them. The usual number of flutes is twenty-four <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be as many as forty-four. The base has two convex mouldings called torus, and from the late Hellenic period stood on a square plinth similar to the abacus.|$|E
