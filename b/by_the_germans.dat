5|$|The six {{surviving}} Yugoslav {{boats were}} {{captured by the}} Italians during the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, and were operated by the Regia Marina in a coastal and second-line escort role. Immediately following the Italian capitulation in September 1943, one ex-Yugoslav boat was sunk by German aircraft, another was scuttled by its Italian crew, and two more fell back into Yugoslav hands a few months later. The remaining two were seized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans.</b> Of the two ex-Yugoslav boats taken over <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans,</b> both were operated by Croatian crews or by the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia for some time before being recovered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans.</b> One was destroyed by Royal Navy Motor Torpedo Boats in June 1944, {{and the other was}} sunk by Royal Air Force aircraft in 1945.

5|$|Kalinin {{was one of}} the Project 26bis2 cruisers, {{the third}} pair of the s. She was larger and had a more {{powerful}} anti-aircraft armament than her half-sisters. She was assembled at the newly constructed Shipyard 199, Komsomolsk-on-Amur, from components built at the Shipyard 198 (Marti South) in Nikolayev. She was laid down on 12 August 1938, launched from drydock on 8 May 1942 and was completed on 31 December 1942 after being towed down the Amur River to Vladivostok. Her construction was prolonged by late deliveries from western factories. For example, her propellers had to be shipped from Leningrad after it had been surrounded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> and her propeller shafts had to be removed from the Barrikada factory in Stalingrad in 1942 before it was destroyed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans.</b>|$|E
