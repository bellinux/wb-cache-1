5|$|Romance {{sold over}} sevenmillion copies worldwide, his bestselling record in his music career. In the United States, it spent 32 weeks at {{number one on}} the Billboard Latin Pop Albums chart, and was the first Spanish-language album by a non-crossover Latin artist to be {{certified}} gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); it was also certified gold in Brazil and Taiwan, firsts for a Spanish-speaking artist. Romance is the third-bestselling album of all time in Mexico, and the bestselling record in Argentina by a non-native artist. The album was noted by critics as reviving interest in <b>bolero</b> music. Its success encouraged Miguel to release three more <b>bolero</b> records: Segundo Romance (1994), Romances (1997) and Mis Romances (2001).|$|E
5|$|After {{an absence}} of two years from the music scene, Miguel {{announced}} on 19 July 1999 that he would release an album by September, saying {{it would be a}} return to pop recordings as opposed to the <b>bolero</b> cover versions he had recorded on the Romance series. The record's final title, Amarte Es un Placer was announced on 17 August 1999.|$|E

5|$|Dominican {{popular music}} history {{can be traced}} back to the 1940s and '50s, when dance bands like the Casimir Brothers and, later, The Swinging Stars, became famous across the island. Their music was a dance-oriented version of many kinds of Caribbean and Latin popular music, such as Cuban <b>bolero,</b> Brazilian samba, the merengue from the Dominican Republic, Trinidadian calypso, and American funk.|$|E
5|$|El Ejemplo (The Example) is {{a studio}} album by Mexican {{recording}} artists Los Tigres del Norte.

5|$|Koji Kondo (credited as Konchan) {{composed}} the game's music. He initially {{planned to use}} Maurice Ravel's <b>Boléro</b> as the game's title theme, but was forced to change it when he learned, late in the game's development cycle, that the copyright for the orchestral piece had not yet expired. As a result, Kondo wrote a new arrangement of the overworld theme within one day.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to the Indies, Andjar formed another {{theatrical}} troupe, <b>Bolero,</b> with Effendi, but left the troupe around 1940 to work at Kolf Publishers in Surabaya. Effendi was left as the head of <b>Bolero,</b> which then became more politicised. At Kolf Andjar edited the publisher's magazine Poestaka Timoer. As his work entailed writing synopses and serials based on popular films for Kolf's magazine, he became increasingly involved in the film industry. He was soon asked by The Teng Chun, with whom he had maintained a business relationship, to direct a film for his company Java Industrial Film (JIF); with this Andjar became one of several noted theatrical personnel who migrated to film following Albert Balink's 1937 hit Terang Boelan (Full Moon).|$|E
5|$|Buena Vista Social Club is an {{ensemble}} of Cuban musicians established in 1996 {{to revive the}} music of pre-revolutionary Cuba. The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos González. They named the group after the homonymous members' club in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, <b>bolero</b> and danzón, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, many {{of which had been}} retired for years.|$|E
5|$|Her {{green eyes}} {{were meant to}} symbolize nature and also served as another {{contrast}} to Tifa's brown eyes. Nomura did not change much of Aerith's design for Advent Children, but her design was updated in Kingdom Hearts with the removal of her <b>bolero</b> jacket, which made her attire appear more as Amano had originally drawn her. Other changes included the addition of bracelets and a belt. Nomura modified her dress in Before Crisis, adding white and green colors, and this version was also {{used as the basis}} for her design in Kingdom Hearts II.|$|E

5|$|In the song, {{the protagonist}} kisses {{different}} lips {{looking for new}} sensations, haunted {{by the memory of}} a past love. The song has experienced popular acclaim, especially with the version recorded by Mexican singer Luis Miguel on his album Romance released in 1991. This version peaked {{at the top of the}} Billboard Top Latin Songs chart in the United States, and the album was deemed as responsible for reviving the <b>bolero</b> genre.|$|E
5|$|Segundo Romance {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised its production, Miguel's vocals {{and the choice}} of songs. It earned several awards, including the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Performance. By 1995, Segundo Romance had sold over four million copies and achieved multi-platinum status in many Latin American countries and Spain, and was certified platinum in the United States. Like its predecessor, the album helped continue renewing mainstream interest in <b>bolero</b> music.|$|E

5|$|Aerith was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura, with influence from director and scenario writer Yoshinori Kitase and Hironobu Sakaguchi, whilst Yoshitaka Amano created conceptual artwork which also helped to influence her design. She has green eyes and long brown hair tied in a braid with a pink ribbon. She wears a long pink dress, a <b>bolero</b> jacket, and brown hiking boots. The long dress {{was designed}} to appear ladylike and as a contrast to Tifa Lockhart's miniskirt. During development, Aerith {{was supposed to be}} Sephiroth's sister as both designs resembled each other, but they were made former lovers with Aerith remembering Sephiroth when meeting Cloud as both are ex-SOLDIERS. Late during development, Aerith's first love was changed to Zack Fair.|$|E
5|$|Born to a music-loving family, Ravel {{attended}} France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was {{not well}} regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the Conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, <b>Boléro</b> (1928), in which repetition {{takes the place of}} development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known.|$|E
5|$|Madonna also {{performed}} {{an excerpt of}} the song at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in 2012, where she was joined by Cee Lo Green and by a large marching band. The same year, the song was included on The MDNA Tour. Following an 8-minute monologue against intolerance, the song was reinvented and performed in a Basque, folk acoustic version, relying only on drums, which were played by the Basque band Kalakan, and Madonna's vocal harmony. Madonna's outfit during the performance consisted of an all-leather look, a custom design by Hervé Léger and Max Azria, with knee-high boots and a mini fur <b>bolero,</b> while her dancers were dressed as soldiers.|$|E

With Panggilan Darah, which he also wrote, Suska became one of several reporters who entered the film industry in the 1940s. He directed the film for the Batavia-based film company Oriental, run by the ethnic Chinese producer Tjho Seng Han. The production house had previously released three films, all directed by Njoo Cheong Seng, but after Njoo departed for Fred Young's Majestic, Oriental had required a new director.|$|E
5|$|Romance is {{the eighth}} studio album by Mexican singer Luis Miguel. It was {{released}} by WEA Latina on 19 November 1991. Although the production was originally intended as another collaboration with Juan Carlos Calderón, that plan was scrapped when Calderón was unable to compose songs for the album. Facing a new-material deadline in his recording contract, at his manager's suggestion Miguel chose <b>bolero</b> music for his next project. Mexican singer-songwriter Armando Manzanero was hired by WEA Latina to co-produce the album with Miguel. Recording began in August 1991 at Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California, with Bebu Silvetti the arranger.|$|E
5|$|Sapporo, Japan, and Gothenburg, Sweden, were front-runners to {{host the}} 1984 Winter Olympics. It was {{therefore}} a surprise when Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, was selected as host. The Games were well-organised and not affected by {{the run-up to the}} war that engulfed the country eight years later. A total of 49 nations and 1,272 athletes participated in 39 events. Host nation Yugoslavia won its first Olympic medal when alpine skier Jure Franko won a silver in the giant slalom. Another sporting highlight was the free dance performance of British ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean. Their performance to Ravel's <b>Boléro</b> earned the pair the gold medal after achieving unanimous perfect scores for artistic impression.|$|E
