He was voted Restaurateur of the Year at the Tatler Restaurant Awards in 2004, and Harden's restaurant guide selected him as the fourth-best chef in London, although La Fleur closed due to problems with the lease for the site.

5|$|The Royalist {{commander}} Prince Maurice conscripted {{the adult}} {{men and women}} of Worcester to work on the walls, threatening the death penalty if they did not attend. To form these new defences, the buildings outside the old city walls were cleared and six large bastions were attached to them along the north and east sides of the city, while a sconce, Fort Royal Hill was built outside Sidbury Gate in the south, linked to the walls by a walkway. The ditch protecting the new earthworks was relatively shallow at about eight feet (2.4 m) deep, but when combined with the high ramparts of the bastions, which were probably protected by sharpened stakes and a <b>banquette</b> firing platform, the bastions would have been well defended. During the short unsuccessfully siege 1643 and the long successful siege of 1646 the reinforced defences were able to withstand the artillery bombardments – the surrender in 1646 was mainly the result of a shortage of food and the collapse of the wider Royalist position across the south-west of England.|$|E

40|$|Deposition {{dynamics}} of <b>banquettes</b> {{have been investigated}} on four beach of Sardinia using different techniques. In three beaches deposition dynamics were investigated by means of topographic techniques, by using a RTK DGPS. In one beach the deposition {{dynamics of}} <b>banquettes</b> have been studied analyzing the image acquired by a webcam. <b>Banquettes</b> deposition occurs during the final phases of a storm event,when wave energy decreases. The landward limit of <b>banquettes</b> marks the maximum wave run-up, where heavier materials are deposited. The sequence of deposition and erosion of <b>banquettes</b> depend {{on the availability of}} litter, and occur several times during one year. Our study identify various sequence of deposition and erosion of <b>banquettes</b> on beach from October to April...|$|R

Its {{interiors}} celebrate the richness and beauty of unique elements of pan-African culture and heritage in a contemporary setting, using a palette of carefully selected local artworks, materials, artefacts and textiles. The lounge represents a world-class experience carefully planned with appropriate amenities, for example: an exclusive smoking zone, an enclosed VIP sitting area and baby changing units.

25|$|The {{land for}} the fort was bought by the War Office in 1861 for £1,639, {{but it was not}} built until 1867. The {{estimated}} cost of constructing the fort was reported in 1869 to be £27,343 (equivalent to £. It took the form of a semicircular arc of seven casemates facing the river with a defensive ditch in front. Each casemate was faced in granite with magazines below providing ammunition via hoist shafts. A defensible block constructed of Kentish ragstone closed off the arc and provided the fort's domestic accommodation. The fort's main entrance is at the centre of the defensible block. A small stone-paved parade ground occupied the centre of the fort. After it was built, the ground behind the fort was raised and made into a glacis. On the roof of the fort, accessed from the ground level by two spiral staircases, there was an observation post protected by a <b>banquette</b> (an elevated step to facilitate rifle fire against attackers at close range).|$|E

Fitch (1832–1910) was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and came to Texas in 1850. He was the first sheriff in Bee County before moving to Nueces County, and worked for Richard King of King Ranch fame. He was a captain in the Confederate forces under John Salmon Ford ("Rip" [...] Ford) and a Texas Ranger. In 1877 he bought a ranch in Nueces County, moved to San Antonio in 1899 where he lived until 1905 when he sold his business to live in Boerne. In 1868 he married Avaline Byington of <b>Banquette,</b> Texas and raised a large family. Dr. T.

60|$|Saturday, June 25. Lyons to Genève. As {{this was}} our first {{experience}} in the diligence line, we noticed particularly every peculiarity.

60|$|When at length, {{at the end}} of {{the tour}} in Germany, our {{travellers}} were approaching Cologne on the Rhine, Rollo began to look out, some miles before they reached it, to watch for the first appearance of the town. He had been riding in the coupé of the diligence[1] with his uncle; but now, in order that he might see better, he had changed his place, and taken a seat on the <b>banquette.</b> The <b>banquette</b> is a seat on the top of the coach, and though it is covered above, it is open in front, and so it affords an excellent view. Mr. George remained in the coupé, being very much interested in reading his guide book.|$|E
60|$|Next to Rollo, on the <b>banquette,</b> {{was seated}} a young man, who had mounted up there {{about an hour}} before, though Rollo had not yet spoken to him. Rollo now, however, turned to him, and asked him, in English, if he spoke English.|$|E

50|$|The {{proportions}} of the Salle du Manège, ten times {{as long as it}} was wide, offered poor acoustics for the debates that went on continually under its high vaults. Six tiers of <b>banquettes</b> permitted space for the deputies, ranged on either side of the central tribune, initially planned for the orators' podium. Seated together for solidarity, the deputies seated themselves according to their political opinions, to right and to left of the president's desk, The Mountain and the Girondins, with The Plain seated in the lowest rank of <b>banquettes,</b> from which they were wont to cross to the opposite side, as their opinions dictated. The public found places to witness the spectacle at either end of the hall and in the loge seats above.|$|R
60|$|The clerk {{said that}} there had been a great many persons after a place in the coupé since it had been taken, and that one lady had taken a place on the <b>banquette,</b> because all the other places in the coach had been engaged.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{the clerk}} called out {{the names of}} the people that were to come up to the <b>banquette</b> with me. There were six of them, and there seemed to be only room for three. So I could not imagine where they were all going to sit. They came in a row, one behind the other, up the ladder. Very soon I saw how they were going to sit; for the three that came first--a man and woman and a girl--when they came into the <b>banquette,</b> pushed up the curtain at the back side of it, and so climbed in behind to the garret, and sat on the trunks.

50|$|While Mantegna {{was working}} for the Gonzagas in Mantua, a very {{different}} painter was being employed to design an even more ambitious scheme for the Este family of Ferrara. Cosmè Tura's painting is highly distinctive, both strangely Gothic yet Classicising at the same time. Tura poses Classical figures as if they were saints, surrounds them with luminous symbolic motifs of surreal perfection and clothes them in garments that appear to be crafted out of intricately folded and enamelled copper.Borso d'Este's family had constructed a large <b>banquetting</b> hall and suite known as the Palazzo Schifanoia.
