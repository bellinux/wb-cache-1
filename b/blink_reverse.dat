5000|$|Features: Interlace mode, {{horizontal}} & vertical scrolling, Light pen input, hardware cursor, underline, <b>blink,</b> <b>reverse</b> video, 2 {{character sets}} of 256 each, update ready interrupt ...|$|E
5000|$|Later models {{included}} base colour {{support for}} four colours. [...] "In base color mode, {{the protection and}} intensity bits are used in combination to select among four colors: normally white, red, blue, and green; the protection bits retain their protection functions as well as determining color." [...] Still later models used extended attributes to add support for seven colours, <b>blinking,</b> <b>reverse</b> video, underscoring, field outlining, field validation, and programmed symbols. In addition, later models added character attributes, which could establish, e.g., color for individual characters without starting a new field or taking up a screen position.|$|R
5000|$|The VT100 was {{introduced}} in August 1978, replacing the VT50/VT52 family. Like the earlier models, it communicated with its host system over serial lines at a speed selectable between 50 and 19,200 bit/s. Basic improvements on the VT52 included a 132 column mode, {{and a variety of}} [...] "graphic renditions" [...] including <b>blinking,</b> bolding, <b>reverse</b> video, and underlining. The VT100 also introduced an additional box-drawing character set containing various pseudographics that allowed the drawing of on-screen forms. All setup of the VT100 was accomplished using interactive displays presented on the screen; the setup data was stored in non-volatile memory within the terminal. Maintainability was also significantly improved since a VT100 could be disassembled quickly without use of tools.|$|R
5000|$|... 5251 Display Station. The {{monochrome}} text-only display can {{be either}} 960 characters, formatted as 12 lines of 80 characters, or 1920 characters as 24 lines of 80 characters. Upper and lower case is standard. Text attributes consist of <b>blink,</b> high intensity, <b>reverse</b> video, non-display, underscore, and a unique column separator that causes the field to be preceded and followed by a vertical bar. 5251 and 5252 input format control attributes are optimized for data entry applications and offer significant enhancements over previous 3270 terminals.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we asked whether subthalamic nucleus deep brain {{stimulation}} (STN-DBS) alone, or in combination with L-dopa, modifies voluntary, spontaneous and reflex blinking in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Sixteen PD patients who underwent STN-DBS were studied in four experimental conditions: without STN-DBS and without L-dopa, STN-DBS alone, L-dopa alone and STN-DBS plus L-dopa. The results were compared with those obtained in 15 healthy controls. Voluntary blinking was assessed by asking participants to blink as fast as possible; spontaneous blinking was recorded during two 60 s rest periods; reflex blinking was evoked by electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve. Blinking were recorded and analysed with the SMART motion system. STN-DBS increased the peak velocity and amplitude for both the closing and opening voluntary blink phases, but prolonged the inter-phase pause duration. L-dopa had no effects on voluntary <b>blinking</b> but <b>reversed</b> the increased inter-phase pause duration seen during STN-DBS. Spontaneous blink rate increased after either STN-DBS or L-dopa. Reflex blinking kinematics were not modified by STN-DBS or L-dopa. The STN-DBS effects on voluntary blinking kinematics and spontaneous blinking rate may occur as results of changes of cortico-basal ganglia activity. The prolonged pause duration of voluntary blinking indicates that STN-DBS has {{detrimental effects on the}} cranial region. These results also shed light on the pathophysiology of eyelids opening apraxia following STN-DBS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
