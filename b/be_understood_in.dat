5|$|As the Vanir {{are often}} {{considered}} fertility gods, the Æsir–Vanir War {{has been proposed}} {{as a reflection of}} the invasion of local fertility cults somewhere in regions inhabited by the Germanic peoples by a more aggressive, warlike cult.

5|$|Hergé {{had hoped}} that being the author of an ongoing comic strip would improve his job prospects, for {{at the time he}} was {{beginning}} to develop a reputation as a designer of postcards, stationary, and advertisements. Rather than representing an example of a comic as the medium would come to <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> the following decade, The Adventures of Totor consisted of square boxes containing illustrations with the captions written separately underneath, as was the style found in French comic creator Christophe's works La Famille Fenouillard (The Fenouillard Family) and Sapeur Camembert (Sapper Camembert). Initially using four boxes per page, as the series progressed this was increased to six and then eight, with each page ending on a cliffhanger.|$|E
5|$|In {{memory of}} Henry II, Catherine decided {{to add a}} new chapel to the {{basilica}} of Saint Denis, where the kings of France were traditionally buried. As the centrepiece of this circular chapel, sometimes known as the Valois rotunda, she commissioned a magnificent and innovative tomb for Henry and herself. The design of this tomb should <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> the context of its planned setting. The plan was to integrate the tomb's effigies of {{the king and queen}} with other statues throughout the chapel, creating a vast spatial composition. Catherine's approval would have been essential for such a departure from funerary tradition.|$|E

5|$|Many {{meanings}} {{have been}} suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It may have helped develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open air rock art may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art {{may have had a}} ritual role in rites of initiation, vision quests or totemic ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as notation systems and anthropomorphic figures may have had a role in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|The Lombard {{migration}} {{started on}} Easter Monday, April 2, 568. The decision {{to combine the}} departure with a Christian celebration can <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> the context of Alboin's recent conversion to Arian Christianity, as attested {{by the presence of}} Arian Gothic missionaries at his court. The conversion is likely to have been motivated mostly from political considerations, and intended to consolidate the migration's cohesion, distinguishing them from the Catholic Romans. It also connected Alboin and his people to the Gothic heritage, and in this way obtain the support of the Ostrogoths serving in the Byzantine army as foederati. It has been speculated that Alboin's migration could have been partly the result of a call from surviving Ostrogoths in Italy.|$|E

5|$|The {{principles}} of {{gas metal arc}} welding began to <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> the early 19th century, after Humphry Davy discovered the short pulsed electric arcs in 1800. Vasily Petrov independently produced the continuous electric arc in 1802 (followed by Davy after 1808). It was not until the 1880s that the technology became developed with the aim of industrial usage. At first, carbon electrodes were used in carbon arc welding. By 1890, metal electrodes had been invented by Nikolay Slavyanov and C. L. Coffin. In 1920, an early predecessor of GMAW was invented by P. O. Nobel of General Electric. It used a bare electrode wire and direct current, and used arc voltage to regulate the feed rate. It did not use a shielding gas to protect the weld, as developments in welding atmospheres did not take place until later that decade. In 1926 another forerunner of GMAW was released, but it was not suitable for practical use.|$|E
