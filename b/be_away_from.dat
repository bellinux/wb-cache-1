5|$|Unlike the {{previous}} Indiana Jones films, Spielberg shot the entire {{film in the}} United States, stating {{he did not want}} to <b>be</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his family. Shooting began on June 18, 2007, in Deming, New Mexico. An extensive chase scene set at the fictional Marshall College was filmed between June 28 and July 7 at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut (where Spielberg's son Theo was studying). To keep in line with the fact the story takes place in the 1950s, several facades were changed, although signs were put up in between shots to tell the public what the store or restaurant actually was.|$|E
5|$|Ernst Lindemann met Charlotte Weil (née Fritsche; 1899–1979), a Berlin singer, in {{the spring}} of 1920. The couple married on 1 February 1921, and they had a daughter, Helga Maria, born on 26 February 1924. Lindemann's job as a naval officer demanded that he <b>be</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his family for long periods of time. This proved to be too {{demanding}} on the marriage, and they were divorced in 1932. Lindemann was engaged again on 20 July 1933 to his youngest brother's sister-in-law, Hildegard Burchard. Hildegard was 14 years younger than Lindemann. They married on 27 October 1934 in the St. Annen Church in Berlin–Dahlem. The ceremony was performed by Martin Niemöller, a founder of the Confessing Church, later imprisoned as an anti-Nazi. They had a daughter, Heidi Maria, born on 6 July 1939.|$|E
5|$|Henry Brougham became Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom after a Whig {{election}} victory. In 1833 {{he appointed}} Hogg to a lucrative {{position on the}} royal commission to examine the municipal corporations. Hogg became a fierce critic of the Municipal Corporations Act; he preferred a more deliberate and less ideological approach than most of his fellow commission members, and was {{considered by many to}} be an unusually conservative Whig. His commission work required him to <b>be</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home for an extended period, which proved to be very difficult for Jane. She knew that Hogg was free to abandon her at any time because they were not legally married. After receiving his appointment, Hogg finally visited Norton House after a seven-year absence, but his family had not altered their opinion of his relationship with Jane.|$|E

5|$|On April 15, 2015, Jones {{announced}} he was ending his college career to enter the 2015 NBA draft. He was selected with the 24th overall {{pick in the draft}} by the Cleveland Cavaliers, who then traded his draft rights to his hometown team, the Minnesota Timberwolves, in exchange for a 2019 second round draft pick and the draft rights to the 31st and 36th picks in the draft, Cedi Osman and Rakeem Christmas, respectively. On July 7, 2015, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Timberwolves. Jones started in the preseason opener when Ricky Rubio was sidelined, but did not fare well against Russell Westbrook, going scoreless and nearly giving up a triple double. Jones began the season fourth on the Timberwolves depth chart at point guard (behind Rubio, Zach LaVine and Andre Miller) and was inactive for the October 28 season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers. Jones was active {{for the first time on}} November 7 when Kevin Martin had to <b>be</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the team for the game against the Chicago Bulls. Two games later on November 10, he was active again when three starters were sidelined, including Rubio who was scratched from the lineup right before tipoff. He made his debut that night against the Charlotte Hornets, posting his first assist, steal, rebound and point. On December 5, using the flexible assignment rule, the Timberwolves assigned Jones to the Idaho Stampede, the D-League affiliate of the Utah Jazz. On December 22, he was recalled by the Timberwolves after he averaged 24.7 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.5 steals in 35.2 minutes per game in six starts in the D-League. He made his first NBA field goals on December 23 against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring 6 points in 20 minutes. Jones didn't play in 17 consecutive games (since January 4) and then had a season-high 5 assists on February 8 against the New Orleans Pelicans. By late February, head coach Sam Mitchell noted that Jones would be getting sufficient playing time to be evaluated. He achieved a career-high on February 22 with 9 points on 4-of-7 shooting against the Boston Celtics. On February 28, he posted 6 assists against the Dallas Mavericks. Jones posted 6 assists and 10 points against the San Antonio Spurs on March 8. On April 7, Jones tallied 4 steals against the Sacramento Kings. On April 13, he closed out the season with a 12-assist effort against the New Orleans Pelicans.|$|E

At the same time men, who could <b>be</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> camp for several days at a time, would be expected to know how to sew and cook.|$|E

25|$|In Alabama, {{slaves were}} not allowed to leave their master's {{premises}} without written consent or passes.

25|$|Thermotaxis is {{movement}} along a gradient of temperature. The slugs {{have been}} shown to migrate along extremely shallow gradients of only 0.05°C/cm, but the direction chosen is complicated; it seems to <b>be</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a temperature about 2°C below the temperature to which they had been acclimated. This complicated behavior has been analyzed by computer modeling of the behavior and the periodic pattern of temperature changes in soil caused by daily changes in air temperature. The conclusion is that the behavior moves slugs a few centimeters below the soil surface up to the surface. This is an amazingly sophisticated behavior by a primitive organism with no apparent sense of gravity.|$|E
