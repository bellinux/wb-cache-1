5|$|Surgery may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> {{those with}} a herniated disc that is causing {{significant}} pain radiating into the leg, significant leg weakness, bladder problems, or loss of bowel control.

5|$|A surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a type}} of weather map that depicts positions for high and low-pressure areas, as well as various types of synoptic scale systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms are drawn normally as solid lines at a preferred temperature interval. They show temperature gradients, which can <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients. By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are well}} known for their strong muscle-relaxing {{properties}} and can <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> the treatment of muscle spasms, although tolerance often develops to their muscle relaxant effects. Baclofen or tizanidine are sometimes used {{as an alternative to}} benzodiazepines. Tizanidine has been found to have superior tolerability compared to diazepam and baclofen.|$|E

50|$|Naloxone <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> both <b>in</b> acute opioid {{overdose}} and {{in reducing}} respiratory or mental depression due to opioids. Whether it <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> those in cardiac arrest {{due to an}} opioid overdose is unclear.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} psychosocial {{interventions}} may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> {{the treatment of}} schizophrenia including: family therapy, assertive community treatment, supported employment, cognitive remediation, skills training, token economic interventions, and psychosocial interventions for substance use and weight management. Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations. Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal. Evidence for metacognitive training is mixed with one 2016 review finding benefit and another not. Art or drama therapy have not been well-researched.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E

5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is usually}} treated with daily {{medication}} once a second seizure has occurred, while {{in those at}} high risk, medication may be started after the first seizure. Supporting people's self management of their condition may <b>be</b> <b>useful.</b> <b>In</b> drug-resistant cases different management options may be looked at including a special diet, the implantation of a neurostimulator, or neurosurgery.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} infections {{are related to}} intercourse, taking {{antibiotics}} afterwards may <b>be</b> <b>useful.</b> <b>In</b> post-menopausal women, topical vaginal estrogen {{has been found to}} reduce recurrence. As opposed to topical creams, the use of vaginal estrogen from pessaries has not been as useful as low dose antibiotics. Antibiotics following short term urinary catheterization decreases the subsequent risk of a bladder infection. A number of vaccines are in development as of 2011.|$|E

5|$|Neodymium–iron–boron magnets {{can have}} up to 6% of the {{neodymium}} substituted by dysprosium to raise the coercivity for demanding applications, such as drive motors for electric vehicles and generators for wind turbines. This substitution would require up to 100grams of dysprosium per electric car produced. Based on Toyota's projected 2million units per year, the use of dysprosium in applications such as this would quickly exhaust its available supply. The dysprosium substitution may also <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> other applications because it improves the corrosion resistance of the magnets.|$|E
5|$|Relaxation techniques, such as exercise, yoga or meditation, may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> {{relieving}} {{the stress}} that may aggravate tics, {{but the majority}} of behavioral interventions (such as relaxation training and biofeedback, with the exception of habit reversal) have not been systematically evaluated and are not empirically supported therapies for Tourette's. Deep brain stimulation has been used to treat adults with severe Tourette's that does not respond to conventional treatment, but it is regarded as an invasive, experimental procedure that is unlikely to become widespread.|$|E
5|$|Several {{drugs that}} target {{molecular}} pathways in lung cancer are available, {{especially for the}} treatment of advanced disease.

5|$|Several {{other uses}} have been {{researched}} for bupropion. There has been controversy {{about whether it}} is useful to add an antidepressant such as bupropion to a mood stabilizer in people with bipolar depression, but recent reviews have concluded that bupropion in this situation does no significant harm and may sometimes give significant benefit. Bupropion has shown no effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but there is weak evidence that it may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> treating methamphetamine dependence. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion—like other antidepressants, with the exception of duloxetine (Cymbalta)—is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. It does, however, show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch {{is used in}} {{traditional}} medicine as a diuretic and is reputed to <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>in</b> the treatment of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, gout, kidney stones, nephritis, cystitis, digestive disturbances and respiratory diseases. For these purposes, a decoction of the bark or leaves is generally used. Externally silver birch is used to promote healing, relieve pain and treat inflammations and infections of the skin such as eczema and psoriasis.|$|E
