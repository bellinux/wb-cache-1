This would create a class of anglicised Indians who would serve as cultural intermediaries between the British and the Indians; the creation of such a class was necessary before any reform of vernacular education:I feel... {{that it is impossible}} for us, with our limited means, to attempt to educate the body of the people. We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters <b>between</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> millions whom we govern, – a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.|$|E

500|$|MacLachlan was {{not given}} time to settle in. His first flight was in a Tiger Moth on 2 March 1937 in which he gained a 45-minute {{experience}} in an open-cockpit. He flew solo {{for the first time}} on 9 March after rapidly coming to grips with his trainer. He wrote, [...] "You will be glad to hear I went solo today...Mr Sharp did a slow roll. It was pretty grim when we were upside down with nothing but 6,000 feet of air <b>between</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ground.....I simply love flying." [...] MacLachlan was the youngest trainee of the group and after 23 solo and 28 hours dual flight he passed as an average grade pilot on the 27 April. He had come second overall in his examinations. He travelled to RAF Uxbridge the following month. There, he was commissioned acting pilot officer service number 39639 on 18 May 1937. He was posted to No. 3 Flying Training School at Grantham in Lincolnshire. He flew the Hawker Hart and the Hawker Audax {{for the first time on}} 20 May 1938. He enjoyed the speed of the aircraft immensely and indulged in his passion for motor cars by buying an Austin 7 from a Nottingham dealership with his first pay cheque for £14 7s.|$|E

[...] It was widely expected that the host of Talk Soup, Greg Kinnear would take over the role, but Kinnear turned down the opportunity and decided to pursue a career in acting. Stars like Tom Hanks agreed to appear on Late Night, which boosted audience awareness. Even Letterman, who admired O’Brien’s comic sensibility, appeared as a guest to register his support. O'Brien's performance style improved through experience and he began to receive more favorable reviews and ratings the following year. With the ratings gradually improving over the course of two years, Late Night reached a new level of critical and commercial success in 1996. Tom Shales officially recanted his previous critical review with the headline [...] "I was wrong", and O'Brien received his first Emmy writing nomination, which he has gone on to receive every year since.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Tye {{holds the}} opinion {{there are no}} qualia, no [...] "veils of perception" [...] <b>between</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> referents of our thought. He {{describes}} our experience of an object {{in the world as}} [...] "transparent". By this he means that no matter what private understandings and/or misunderstandings we may have of some public entity, it is still there before us in reality. The idea that qualia intervene between ourselves and their origins he regards as [...] "a massive error"; as he says, [...] "it is just not credible that visual experiences are systematically misleading in this way"; [...] "the only objects of which you are aware are the external ones making up the scene before your eyes"; there are [...] "no such things as the qualities of experiences" [...] for [...] "they are qualities of external surfaces (and volumes and films) if they are qualities of anything." [...] This insistence permits him to take our experience as having a reliable base since there is no fear of losing contact with the realness of public objects.|$|E

[...] The key issue for many of them in 1939, for example, was not the fate of the hospital, but rather the future of Europe after Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland. In one instance, [...] "several interns responded by wearing badges to signify support for the Allies," [...] but the hospital's director told them to remove them lest they upset some of the patients. The interns then took the matter to Salk. Salk replied, [...] "everyone should wear the badge as an act of solidarity." [...] One intern recalled, [...] "Jonas was a very staunch guy. He never took a backward step on that issue or any other issue of principle <b>between</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hospital." [...] The hospital administrators backed off and there was no further interference from the director.|$|E

2500|$|Babur {{still wanted}} {{to escape from the}} Uzbeks, and he chose India as a refuge instead of Badakhshan, which was to the north of Kabul. He wrote, [...] "In the {{presence}} of such power and potency, we had to think of some place for ourselves and, at this crisis and in the crack of time there was, put a wider space <b>between</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> strong foeman." [...] After his third loss of Samarkand, Babur gave full attention to the conquest of North India, launching a campaign; he reached Chenab, now in Pakistan, in 1519. Until 1524, his aim was to only expand his rule to Punjab, mainly to fulfill the legacy of his ancestor Timur, since it used to be part of his empire. At the time parts of north India were under the rule of Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty, but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors. He received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of Punjab and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim. He sent an ambassador to Ibrahim, claiming himself the rightful heir to the throne, but the ambassador was detained at Lahore and released months later.|$|E

[...] However, he said they still occasionally wear makeup, just not as much. Toshiya explained [...] "To be honest, when we first started and we were wearing a lot of makeup on stage and stuff, {{there were a lot of}} bands doing that at the time in Japan, and people thought it was cool. But not anymore, ha ha." [...] Die said [...] "They saw us as idols but we aren't idols. We are a band, we play music and want to be known for it. So we decided to change our style slowly."

2500|$|William Blake, a Romantic {{poet and}} artist, thought that Wordsworth {{was at the}} same level as the poets Dante, Shakespeare, and Milton. In a diary entry for 27 December 1825, H. C. Robinson recounted a {{conversation}} between himself and William Blake shortly before Blake's death: [...] "I read to him Wordsworth's incomparable ode, which he heartily enjoyed. But he repeated, 'I fear Wordsworth loves nature, and nature is the work of the Devil. The Devil is in us as 'far as we are nature.'... The parts of Wordsworth's ode which Blake most enjoyed were the most obscure—at all events, those which I least like and comprehend." [...] Following Blake, Chauncy Hare Townshend produced [...] "An Essay on the Theory and the Writings of Wordsworth"for Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine in 1829. In the third part, he critiqued Wordsworth's use of pre-existence within the poem and asked [...] "unless our author means to say that, having existed from all eternity, we are of an eternal and indestructible essence; or, in other words, that being incarnate portion of the Deity... we are as Immortal as himself. But if the poet intends to affirm this, do you not perceive that he frustrates his own aim?" [...] He continued by explaining why he felt that Wordsworth's concept fell short of any useful purpose: [...] "For if we are of God's indivisible essence, and receive our separate consciousness from the wall of flesh which, at our birth, was raised <b>between</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Found of Being, we must, on the dissolution of the body... be again merged in the simple and uncompounded Godhead, lose our individual consciousness... in another sense, become as though we had never been." [...] He concluded his analysis with a critique of the poem as a whole: [...] "I should say that Wordsworth does not display in it any great clearness of thought, or felicity of language... the ode in question is not so much abstruse in idea as crabbed in expression. There appears to be a laborious toiling after originality, ending in a dismal want of harmony." ...|$|E
