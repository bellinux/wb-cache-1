50|$|For {{certain types}} of {{electric}} motors or generators to function, the coils of the rotor must be connected to complete an electrical circuit. To accomplish this, a copper or brass commutator or 'slip rings' are affixed to the shaft, and springs press <b>braided</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> 'brushes' onto the rings which conduct the current. Such brushes provided poor commutation as they moved from one commutator segment to the next. The cure was the introduction of 'high resistance brushes' made from graphite (sometimes with added copper). Although the resistance was {{of the order of}} tens of milliohms, they were high resistance enough to provide a gradual shift of current from one commutator segment to the next. The term brush remains in use. Since the brushes wear out, they can be replaced in products intended to allow maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{conventional}} coaxial cables use <b>braided</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> {{forming the}} shield. This allows the cable to be flexible, {{but it also}} means there are gaps in the shield layer, and the inner dimension of the shield varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat. Sometimes the braid is silver-plated. For better shield performance, some cables have a double-layer shield. The shield might be just two braids, but it is more common now to have a thin foil shield covered by a wire braid. Some cables may invest in more than two shield layers, such as [...] "quad-shield", which uses four alternating layers of foil and braid. Other shield designs sacrifice flexibility for better performance; some shields are a solid metal tube. Those cables cannot be bent sharply, as the shield will kink, causing losses in the cable. When a foil shield is used a small wire conductor incorporated into the foil makes soldering the shield termination easier.|$|E
50|$|Multi-mode fiber {{found some}} uses in {{high-performance}} computing applications, notably the Fibre Channel system for high speed disks and some parallel computing interconnection systems. However, the relatively inflexible cables made them less useful in general roles, where <b>braided</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> remains widespread. Fiber has found one consumer use, the TOSLINK cable used in digital audio applications. This role uses lower quality multi-mode plastic fibre with limited bandwidth, about 125 Mbit/s, driven by red LEDs. However, advances in computers have demanded ever increasing bandwidth, and modern computer bus systems are quickly reaching their limits. There was some discussion {{of moving to}} optical fiber for the USB3 standard, but {{the decision was made}} to move ahead with copper.|$|R
50|$|Some {{balanced}} lines {{also have}} electrostatic shielding {{to reduce the}} amount of noise introduced.

40|$|Thin {{metallic}} straight wires or thicker wire coils may {{be incorporated}} into composite materials to tune their overall electromagnetic (EM) properties, e. g., to render their index of refraction equal to 1, over a range of frequencies. These wire arrays act as scattering elements, providing controlled response to EM radiation such as RF communication signals, radar, or other signals in the infrared range. Integrated into composites, the arrays further contribute to their structural integrity. Braided composites function as ideal hosts for coiled wire arrays due to the helical nature of the braiding process and the periodicity of laminated composites. The coil's pitch and diameter, as primary EM tuning parameters, can be closely controlled in the braiding process to optimize EM properties. Structural fibers are <b>braided</b> with <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> to form individual elements of the array. Additionally, thermoplastic matrix fibers are commingled into the core and outer portions of the braid to facilitate complete fiber wetting of the composite and ensure structural integrity. These elements are woven, or oriented otherwise, into layers to form arrays with periodic spacing in three dimensions. The composite is then laminated, together with additional thermoplastic matrix material, to yield a fully integrated system with tunable multifunctional properties. Chiral EM properties in the composite, resulting from the helical configuration and periodic arrangement of the wires, can be controlled or completely eliminated by design in the braiding and weaving processes. This paper deals with the processing and characterization of the metallic coil polymer braids {{and serves as a}} companion paper to a detailed study of EM properties and chirality effects, entitled "Metallic Coil-Polymer Brai...|$|R

40|$|A compact {{additive}} manufactured flat-panel gas-gap heat switch {{operating at}} cryogenic temperature is {{reported in this}} paper. A guarded-hot-plate apparatus has been developed to measure the thermal conductance of the heat switch with the heat sink temperature {{in the range of}} 100 – 180 K. The apparatus is cooled by a two-stage GM cooler and the temperature is controlled with a heater and a <b>braided</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> connection. A thermal guard is mounted on the hot side of the device to confine the heat flow axially through the sample. A gas handling system allows testing the device with different gas pressures in the heat switch. Experiments are performed at various heat sink temperatures, by varying gas pressure in the gas-gap and with helium, hydrogen and nitrogen gas. The measured off-conductance with a heat sink temperature of 115 K and the hot plate at 120 K is 0. 134 W/K, the on-conductance with helium and hydrogen gases at the same temperatures is 4. 80 W/K and 4. 71 W/K, respectively. This results in an on/off conductance ratio of 37 ± 7 and 35 ± 6 for helium and hydrogen respectively. The experimental results matches fairly well with the predicted heat conductance at cryogenic temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Electronics {{soldering}} is {{a technique}} used frequently in the manufacturing of Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) to attach small electronic parts or wires together. Often times the need to remove a solder joint arises; {{this is known as}} desoldering. Solder wick, fine <b>braided</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> infused with rosin, {{is one of the most}} effective ways to desolder because it results in the cleanest joints. Currently using solder wick involves several time consuming and somewhat awkward steps. This report will cover the process behind designing, manufacturing, and testing a new ergonomic, dispenser for solder wick that can be used with one hand. After coming up with a new design, I made a functional prototype to assist in testing the design. The prototype was made with an ABS plastic material. To determine if the Solder Qwik Pen is a significantly faster method to use compared to a coil of solder wick, an experiment was done. The experiment’s results showed that the Solder Qwik Pen did have a significantly faster average time among users than the solder wick coil. Not only is the Solder Qwik Pen an improvement on the old solder wick method of desoldering, it could easily lead to other products being sold as companion products...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{our past}} studies, we {{confirmed}} that thick straight <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> of 1 mmφ and over it were broken in a solid state before melting.

However, the magnetic force and skin effect are primarily responsible for breaking thick <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> rather than thermal failure, as previously thought. When the thick curved <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> were impressed by the lightning impulse current, they deformed into “heart ” shape before they are broken. We used FEM software to simulate the deforming process when the curved <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> carried the lightning impulse current.

However, copper sulphide deposition on oil-paper insulation can lead to insulation failures in power transformers. This paper presents the influences of copper sulfur corrosion and copper sulphide deposition on <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and oil-paper insulation in power transformers. Thermal aging tests of paper-wrapped <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and bare <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> in insulating oil were carried out at 130 °C and 150 °C in laboratory. The corrosive characteristics of paper-wrapped <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and bare <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> were analyzed. Dielectric properties of insulation paper and insulating oil were also analyzed {{at different stages of}} the thermal aging tests using a broadband dielectric spectrometer. Experiments and analysis results show that copper sulfide deposition on surfaces of <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and insulation paper changes the surface structures of <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and insulation paper. Copper sulfur corrosion changes the dielectric properties of oil-paper insulation, and the copper sulfide deposition greatly reduces the electrical breakdown strength of oil-paper insulation.

40|$|Wire bonding {{technology}} is the earliest chip level interconnection technology, {{but it is still}} the most widely used one in integrated circuit (IC) assembly for its noticeable advantages over other interconnection technologies. Traditionally, gold wire has been the dominating wiring materials in wire bonding technique. Gold wire has many distinguished characteristics such as excellent ductility, conductivity and chemical stability. However, the biggest reliability issue of gold wire bonding is associated with intermetallic compound (IMC) generated at the gold wire-aluminum bonding pad interface. The rapid development of IC technology desires devices that are smaller, faster and cheaper; progressive high current or high power devices demand alterative interconnection materials which have thermal properties and electrical conductivity that are superior to those of gold. With many distinguished advantages such as a higher conductivity, superior mechanical properties, less tendency of forming IMC and especially a much lower cost, copper have rapidly gain a foothold as the main potential material to replace gold for the wire bonding in electronic packaging. Although many integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and fabless semiconductor companies are considering the application of <b>copper</b> bonding <b>wire</b> in at least some product designs, there are still deep reservations in the industry over the use of this material, particularly due to concerns over in-service product reliability. Corrosion issue is the biggest problem of <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages. To prevent the corrosion, epoxy molding compound (EMC) is required to have excellent properties to provide good protection to <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages. Thus the evaluation and selection of epoxy molding compound for <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages are very important. In this study, the corrosion mechanism of <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> package is studies and discussed, EMC inherently absorbs moisture or water from the environment, substances contained in EMC may have a tendency to dissolve and ionize in the absorbed water and form an electrolyte, corrosion of <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> will take place if placed in a suitable electrolyte. Due to its lower nobility compared with gold, <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> has a higher possibility to be corroded under the same conditions, than means the requirement of epoxy molding compound is stricter when used in <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages. Some EMC properties are correlated to the corrosion of <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> in packages, and the effects of these properties on the corrosion of <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages are discussed in detail. To fully evaluate epoxy molding compounds, a series of systemic characterization methods are established in this study. EMC properties which affect the corrosion of <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> are characterized.

40|$|<b>Copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonds have {{replaced}} gold wire bonds {{in the majority}} of commercial semiconductor devices for the latest technology nodes. Although economics has been the driving mechanism to lower semiconductor packaging costs for a savings of about 20 % by replacing gold <b>wire</b> bonds with <b>copper,</b> copper also has materials property advantages over gold. When compared to gold, copper has approximately: 25 % lower electrical resistivity, 30 % higher thermal conductivity, 75 % higher tensile strength and 45 % higher modulus of elasticity. <b>Copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonds on aluminum bond pads are also more mechanically robust over time and elevated temperature due to the slower intermetallic formation rate - approximately 1 / 100 th that of the gold to aluminum intermetallic formation rate. However, there are significant tradeoffs with <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonding - <b>copper</b> has twice the hardness of gold which results in a narrower bonding manufacturing process window and requires that the semiconductor companies design more mechanically rigid bonding pads to prevent cratering to both the bond pad and underlying chip structure. Furthermore, copper is significantly more prone to corrosion issues. The semiconductor packaging industry has responded to this corrosion concern by creating a palladium coated <b>copper</b> bonding <b>wire,</b> which is more corrosion resistant than pure <b>copper</b> bonding <b>wire.</b> Also, the selection of the device molding compound is critical because use of environmentally friendly green compounds can result in internal CTE (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion) mismatches with the <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonds that can eventually lead to device failures during thermal cycling. Despite the difficult problems associated with the changeover to <b>copper</b> bonding <b>wire,</b> there are billions of <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonded devices delivered annually to customers.
