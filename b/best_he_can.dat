500|$|James Berardinelli {{praised the}} acting and {{considered}} that focusing the narrative on {{the struggle of}} one character made the film more effective, but described the ending as weak, even though Spielberg [...] "does the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> to make it cinematically dramatic". Total Films review gave War of the Worlds 4 out of 5 stars, considering that [...] "Spielberg finds fresh juice in a tale already adapted for film, TV, stage, radio and record", and describing the film as having many [...] "startling images", comparing the first Tripod attack to the Omaha Beach landing from Saving Private Ryan.|$|E

In the miniseries, he played Jack Nash, a television reporter who battles an addiction to cocaine. The Andromeda Strain received mixed reviews, and McCormack's performance was criticized. Joanna Weiss of the Boston Globe wrote, [...] "The presence of Eric McCormack, as an intrepid TV reporter, is especially extraneous (no disrespect to intrepid reporters)." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today commented, [...] "The central cast is completed by... poor Eric McCormack as a crusading, coke-addicted journalist who spends {{the second half of the}} movie playing Rambo in the desert. Let's just say McCormack does the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> with what he's given, and leave it at that."

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 10, 1910. It states: [...] "Rip Van Winkle, although a loving father to his little girl Meenie and a hail-fellow-well-met {{with all of his}} fellow townsmen, is being constantly scolded by his wife for leading an idle and profitless existence. Rip is also fond of the bottle and spends a greater part of his time and money at the village tavern. Catching him entering the house late one night after a day's carousing, his wife Gretchen becomes thoroughly angry with him and drives him from the house. In the face of a terrible storm with only his dog Schneider and his faithful rifle to protect him, Rip wanders toward the mountains. Here he comes across a band of gnomes who are supposed to be the spirits of Heinrich Hudson [...] and his merry men who disappeared near the Catskill Mountains hundreds of years before, and had never been heard of since. The gnomes give Rip some magic schnapps to drink, and under its influence he goes to sleep for 20 years. When he awakes, he is an old man and in ragged clothes. His dog is dead, and his rifle has rusted away. He makes his way as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> back to the village, and his own home. But there no one knows him. He finds his wife married to another man, his daughter grown to womanhood, and most of his old friends dead and gone. Rip, however, finally manages to prove his identity, and also to lay claim to his property, which has greatly increased in value during his sleep, in which he is just in time to save from being unlawfully confiscated by his old-time enemy. Happily reunited to his family, Rip looks forward to his declining years with a spirit born of peace and solace." ...|$|E

The proper {{pronunciation}} of her name (Her-my-oh-nee) is interjected into the plot when she teaches it to Krum; the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> do is [...] "Herm-own-ninny," [...] but she has no problem with it. She later gets into a heated argument with Ron after he accuses her of [...] "fraternising with the enemy" [...] in reference to her friendship with Krum. In the book, Hermione's feelings toward Ron are hinted at when she says that Ron can't see her [...] "like a girl," [...] but Krum could. She supports Harry through the Triwizard Tournament, helping him prepare for each task. At {{the end of the second}} task, Krum asks her to come see him over the summer in Bulgaria, but she politely refuses. Near the end of the term she stops fraudulent tabloid reporter and unregistered Animagus, Rita Skeeter, who had published defamatory material about Hermione, Harry, and Hagrid during the Triwizard Tournament, by holding her Animagus form (a beetle) captive in a jar.|$|E

In the episode [...] "The Germans" [...] he shows he has trouble forgiving the Germans because of the wars. The <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> say is that German women make good card players. In the same episode, he also demonstrates his outdated racial attitudes when he comments about the ethnic difference between [...] "wogs" [...] and [...] "niggers"—but in a manner innocent of malice or bigotry. Despite his good intentions, the Major can cause Basil's plans to go awry, notably in the episode [...] "Communication Problems" [...] in which Basil tries his best to keep the money he won in a bet a secret from Sybil.|$|E
