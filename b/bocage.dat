5|$|In 2001, {{the site}} {{was brought to the}} {{attention}} of the CPIE <b>Bocage</b> de l'Avesnois, pointing out the biodiversity of the new plant life. The association performed the first inventories. In the meantime, she contacted the five owners to consider a land management proposal. The commune of Bavay, the Bellignies quarry (SECAB) and a third owner sold her the property in 2003. The CPIE <b>Bocage</b> de l'Avesnois became the owner / operator of 85 percent of the site. The association implemented the first environmental resources management actions at the site and developed its first environmental management scheme In 2009, the association obtained the agreement establishing the regional nature reserve at the site for a period of 20 years.|$|E

5|$|The Bavay's {{municipality}} has erected two {{barriers to}} prohibit access to motorized vehicles. Volunteers and {{employees of the}} CPIE <b>Bocage</b> de l'Avesnois manage the site regularly.|$|E
5|$|CPIE <b>Bocage</b> de l'Avesnois, a {{non-governmental}} organization, is {{the owner}} and operator of the reserve. The main objective is to maintain the current diversity. To this end, regular management mainly struggles against the afforestation and against invasive species, such as Japanese knot weed. The secondary objectives are environmental education, heritage interpretation, improvement of knowledge fauna and flora, and environmental monitoring.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 and 1957, the British and Commonwealth {{system of}} battle honours {{recognised}} {{participation in the}} Battle of Villers-Bocage by the award to 11 units of the battle honour Villers <b>Bocage,</b> for service in expanding the bridgehead from 8–15 June. For his actions at Villers-Bocage, Michael Wittmann was promoted to Hauptsturmführer and awarded Swords to his Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.|$|E
50|$|Tarentola bocagei (English name: <b>Bocage's</b> gecko or <b>Bocage's</b> wall gecko) is {{a species}} of geckos in the family Phyllodactylidae. The species is endemic to the Cape Verde Islands and are founded in the island of São Nicolau. The species was named in 2012. It was once a {{subspecies}} of Tarentola boavistensis.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bocage’s</b> tree frog is {{very similar}} in {{appearance}} to the Lake Upemba forest tree frog (Leptopelis parbocagii) and they are probably part of a species complex. Their ranges overlap, but <b>Bocage’s</b> tree frog has a larger range, extending from Ethiopia southwards to Namibia and Zambia. Its typical habitat is grassland and savannah, both wet and dry.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bocage's</b> rock rat (Aethomys bocagei) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Muridae.|$|R
5|$|Marie {{noted that}} Dempsey was {{disappointed}} in the lack of tactical flair shown by Brigadier Hinde throughout the battle and that the British {{should have known better}} than to attempt an armoured advance unsupported by infantry in the <b>bocage.</b> The British fought an uncoordinated infantry and tank battle during the morning and the Germans did much the same throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the water would drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The <b>bocage</b> hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E
5|$|Caen was an Operation Overlord {{goal for}} I Corps of the Anglo-Canadian Second Army, which landed forces on two Norman beaches on 6 June 1944, {{to capture the}} city and the Carpiquet area. German {{resistance}} prevented the town from being captured on D-Day, a result considered possible by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey the Second Army commander. For the next three weeks, positional warfare took place around Caen as both sides attacked and counter-attacked for minor tactical advantage on the Anglo-Canadian front and as part of a strategic intent to force the Germans to keep their most powerful armoured units away from the US First Army, as it captured Cherbourg and then pushed southwards through the <b>bocage</b> towards St. Lô.|$|E
50|$|Carriçal was {{the first}} place where the <b>Bocage's</b> wall gecko (Tarentola bocagei) was first described.|$|R
50|$|Leptotyphlops rostratus, or <b>Bocage's</b> blind snake, is {{a species}} of snake in the family Leptotyphlopidae.|$|R
50|$|The Ovambo tree skink (Trachylepis binotata) is {{a species}} of skink from Namibia and Angola also known as <b>Bocage's</b> Mabuya.|$|R
5|$|During {{the rule}} of Grand Master Perellos, the Order was {{amassing}} great wealth. The Inquisitor Delci desired to garner greater power in Malta and attempted to take hold of the Order's hospital. This hospital was a privileged place and nobody could be admitted prior to presenting their honorary crests, however the inquisition's officers infiltrated the hospital and commenced a formal inspection. These were soon ordered to leave the premises by the commanding knight of Avernes de <b>Bocage,</b> who was the hospital's supervisor. This news reached Grand Master Perellos, who sent his emissary, the Great Prior Marc'Antonio Zondadari, to the Court of Rome to forward complaints about the incident.|$|E
5|$|In general, Geographia Neoteriki, {{was welcomed}} with enthusiasm by western {{intellectual}} circles. Jean-Baptiste d'Ansse de Villoison, professor of modern Greek in the Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes, {{used it as a}} textbook for his students. French geographer Barbie du <b>Bocage</b> published a review after the book's publication along with a translated passage. Moreover, travellers who published accounts during the early 19th century, frequently cited the text. François Pouqueville, William Martin Leake, Henry Holland, and Lord Byron mentioned this work, and used it as a source of information. The book also enjoyed some popularity in the non Greek regions of the Balkan peninsula, while 19th century Bulgarian authors of geographic textbooks used it as a model.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{directed}} by Steve McQueen. The screenplay was written by John Ridley. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Solomon Northup. Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Brad Pitt, and Alfre Woodard are all featured in supporting roles. Principal photography took place in New Orleans, Louisiana, from June 27 to August 13, 2012. The locations used were four historic antebellum plantations: Felicity, <b>Bocage,</b> Destrehan, and Magnolia. Of the four, Magnolia is nearest to the actual plantation where Northup was held.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bocage's</b> sunbird (Nectarinia bocagii) is {{a species}} of bird in the Nectariniidae family.It is found in Angola and the DRC.|$|R
5000|$|Uganda bristlebill (B. s. woosnami) - Ogilvie-Grant, 1907: Also named <b>Bocage's</b> bristlebill. Found {{from eastern}} Democratic Republic of the Congo to {{southern}} Sudan, western Kenya, north-western Zambia ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bocage's</b> longbill, Amaurocichla bocagei, {{a species}} of {{passerine}} bird, belongs to the superfamily Passeroidea. Since it is unclear to which family it belongs, it is classified as Passeroidea incertae sedis.|$|R
5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the Portuguese dogfish was published by Portuguese zoologists José Vicente Barbosa du <b>Bocage</b> and Félix António de Brito Capello, in an 1864 issue of Proceedings of the General Meetings for Scientific Business of the Zoological Society of London. They created the new genus Centroscymnus for this shark, and gave it the specific epithet coelolepis, derived from the Greek koilos ("hollow") and lepis ("fish scale") and referring {{to the structure of}} the dermal denticles. The type specimen, caught off Portugal, has since been destroyed in a fire.|$|E
5|$|To {{overcome}} {{the constraints of}} the <b>bocage</b> that had made attacks so difficult and costly for both sides, Rhino modifications were made to some M4 Sherman, M5A1 Stuart tanks and M10 tank destroyers, by fitting them with hedge-breaching 'tusks' that could force a path through hedgerows. German tanks remained restricted to the roads but U.S. armored vehicles could maneuver more freely, although the effectiveness of the devices was exaggerated. By the eve of Cobra, 60 percent of the tanks of the First Army had the rhino modification. To preserve operational security, Bradley forbade their use until Cobra was launched. In all, 1,269 M4 medium tanks, 694 M5A1 light tanks and 288 M10 tank destroyers were available.|$|E
5|$|By 31 July, XIX Corps had {{destroyed}} the last forces opposing the First Army, which {{emerged from the}} <b>bocage.</b> Reinforcements were moved west by Field Marshal Günther von Kluge and employed in various counterattacks, the largest of which, Unternehmen Lüttich (Operation Liège), was launched on 7 August between Mortain and Avranches. Although {{this led to the}} bloodiest phase of the battle, it was mounted by already exhausted and understrength units and was a costly failure. On 8 August, troops of the newly activated Third United States Army captured the city of Le Mans, formerly the German 7th Army headquarters. Operation Cobra transformed the high-intensity infantry combat of Normandy into rapid maneuver warfare and {{led to the creation of}} the Falaise pocket and the loss of the German position in northwestern France.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bocage's</b> weaver (Ploceus temporalis) is {{a species}} of bird in the Ploceidae family.It is found in {{riparian}} zones of Angola, southern Democratic Republic of the Congo and northwestern Zambia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bocage's</b> wall lizard {{is found}} in {{northern}} Portugal and northwestern Spain as far southwards as the River Douro. Its typical habitat is open deciduous woodland, scrubland, coastal sand dunes and cultivated areas, including in villages.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bocage's</b> wall lizard {{is common}} in {{suitable}} habitat within its range. The population is steady and faces no specific threats and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
5|$|Following the bird's extinction, {{remains of}} the great auk {{increased}} dramatically in value, and auctions of specimens created intense interest in Victorian Britain, where 15 specimens are now located, {{the largest number of}} any country. A specimen was bought in 1971 by the Icelandic Museum of National History for £9000, which placed it in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive stuffed bird ever sold. The price of its eggs sometimes reached up to 11 times the amount earned by a skilled worker in a year. The present whereabouts of six of the eggs are unknown. Several other eggs have been destroyed accidentally. Two mounted skins were destroyed in the twentieth century, one in the Mainz Museum during the Second World War, and one in the Museu <b>Bocage,</b> Lisbon that was destroyed by a fire in 1978.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June, the 7th Armoured Division {{took over}} parts of 50th Northumbrian Division front with the 56th Infantry Brigade under command. By nightfall, the 7th Armoured Division {{had reached the}} {{north-western}} fringe of Tilly-sur-Seulles and next day penetrated the village capturing the central crossroads. The Panzer-Lehr Division made several counter-attacks, which forced the British out and attacks by the 50th (Northumbrian) Division bogged down in the <b>bocage</b> against the Panzer-Lehr Division. Army Group B planned to relieve the armoured divisions facing the Second Army from 11 June {{and replace them with}} infantry divisions, to concentrate the tanks in the Carentan area and avert the danger to Cherbourg. Adolf Hitler overruled Rommel and the next day ordered him not to retreat and instead roll up the Allied beachhead from east to west, starting with the Orne bridgehead.|$|E
5|$|Paratroops from 101st Airborne {{were dropped}} {{beginning}} around 01:30, tasked with controlling the causeways behind Utah Beach and destroying road and rail bridges over the Douve River. The C-47s could not fly {{in a tight}} formation because of thick cloud cover, and many paratroopers were dropped far from their intended landing zones. Many planes came in so low that they were under fire from both flak and machine gun fire. Some paratroopers were killed on impact when their parachutes {{did not have time}} to open, and others drowned in the flooded fields. Gathering together into fighting units was made difficult by a shortage of radios and by the <b>bocage</b> terrain, with its hedgerows, stone walls, and marshes. Some units did not arrive at their targets until afternoon, by which time several of the causeways had already been cleared by members of the 4th Infantry Division moving up from the beach.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bocage's</b> mole-rat (Fukomys bocagei) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Bathyergidae.It is found in Angola, Namibia, {{possibly}} Democratic Republic of the Congo, and possibly Zambia.Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, dry savanna, subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland, and caves.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bocage’s</b> tree frog, Leptopelis bocagii, is {{a species}} of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It is found in Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, and {{possibly}} Botswana, Central African Republic, Chad, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Sudan, and Uganda.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bocage's</b> wall lizard (Podarcis bocagei) is {{a species}} of lizard in the family Lacertidae. It is endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. The species' natural {{habitats}} are temperate forests, temperate shrubland, Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation, sandy shores, rural gardens, and urban areas. The IUCN does not consider it to be threatened.|$|R
