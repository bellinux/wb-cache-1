5|$|Strokes {{that occur}} in the {{brainstem}} may cause profound deficits, including locked-in syndrome, in which cognitive, emotional and linguistic abilities remain intact but all or almost all voluntary motor abilities are lost. Most people affected by this type of stroke rely on AAC strategies to communicate, since few recover intelligible speech or functional voice. The AAC strategies used vary with the individual's preferences and motor capabilities which may change over time. As eye movements {{are most likely to be}} preserved, eye <b>blinks</b> are frequently used for communication. Low-tech alphabet boards are often introduced immediately to provide the individual with basic communication. Partner-assisted scanning may be used, in which the AAC user signals when the desired letter is named by a communication partner. When vertical and horizontal eye movements are functional, a transparent alphabet board may be used in which the AAC user looks at the desired letter and this is acknowledged by the communication partner. Individuals with locked-in syndrome have difficulty using high-tech devices due to issues with motor control, vision, memory, alertness and linguistic ability. In particular, a voluntary, reliable and easily controlled muscle movement is necessary to access such a device, such as head, jaw, hand or finger movements. In some individuals, intensive practice, even long after the initial stroke, has been shown to increase the accuracy and consistency of head movements, which can be used to access a communication device.|$|E
40|$|<b>Blinking,</b> a motor act {{consisting}} of a closing and an opening eyelid movement, can be performed voluntarily, spontaneously, and reflexly. In this study we investigated the kinematic features of voluntary, spontaneous, and reflex <b>blinking</b> in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), OFF and ON dopaminergic treatment. Patients were asked to <b>blink</b> voluntarily as fast as possible. Spontaneous <b>blinking</b> was recorded for a minute during which the subjects just relaxed. Reflex <b>blinking</b> was evoked by electrical stimulation on the supraorbital nerve. Eyelid movements were recorded with the SMART analyzer motion system. Patients OFF therapy paused longer than controls during voluntary <b>blinking</b> but not during spontaneous and reflex <b>blinking.</b> The <b>blink</b> rate tended to be lower in patients OFF therapy than in controls and the spontaneous <b>blinking</b> had abnormally low amplitude and peak velocity. Finally, in patients OFF therapy the excitability of the neural circuit mediating the closing phase of the reflex <b>blinking</b> was enhanced. Dopaminergic treatment shortened the pause during voluntary <b>blinking</b> and increased the <b>blink</b> rate. In PD patients the longer pauses between the closing and opening phase in comparison to normal subjects, suggest bradykinesia of voluntary <b>blinking.</b> PD patients also display kinematic abnormalities of spontaneous <b>blinking</b> {{and changes in the}} excitability of the closing phase of reflex <b>blinking.</b> (c) 2008 Movement Disorder Society...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we asked whether subthalamic nucleus deep brain {{stimulation}} (STN-DBS) alone, or in combination with L-dopa, modifies voluntary, spontaneous and reflex <b>blinking</b> in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Sixteen PD patients who underwent STN-DBS were studied in four experimental conditions: without STN-DBS and without L-dopa, STN-DBS alone, L-dopa alone and STN-DBS plus L-dopa. The results were compared with those obtained in 15 healthy controls. Voluntary <b>blinking</b> was assessed by asking participants to <b>blink</b> as fast as possible; spontaneous <b>blinking</b> was recorded during two 60 s rest periods; reflex <b>blinking</b> was evoked by electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve. <b>Blinking</b> were recorded and analysed with the SMART motion system. STN-DBS increased the peak velocity and amplitude for both the closing and opening voluntary <b>blink</b> phases, but prolonged the inter-phase pause duration. L-dopa had no effects on voluntary <b>blinking</b> but reversed the increased inter-phase pause duration seen during STN-DBS. Spontaneous <b>blink</b> rate increased after either STN-DBS or L-dopa. Reflex <b>blinking</b> kinematics were not modified by STN-DBS or L-dopa. The STN-DBS effects on voluntary <b>blinking</b> kinematics and spontaneous <b>blinking</b> rate may occur as results of changes of cortico-basal ganglia activity. The prolonged pause duration of voluntary <b>blinking</b> indicates that STN-DBS has {{detrimental effects on the}} cranial region. These results also shed light on the pathophysiology of eyelids opening apraxia following STN-DBS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two <b>blinks</b> means RAM failure, three <b>blinks</b> means watchdog timer failure. Using Caps Lock key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E

25|$|The most {{prominent}} eye-induced artifacts {{are caused by}} the potential difference between the cornea and retina, which is quite large compared to cerebral potentials. When the eyes and eyelids are completely still, this corneo-retinal dipole does not affect EEG. However, <b>blinks</b> occur several times per minute, the eyes movements occur several times per second. Eyelid movements, occurring mostly during blinking or vertical eye movements, elicit a large potential seen mostly in {{the difference between the}} Electrooculography (EOG) channels above and below the eyes. An established explanation of this potential regards the eyelids as sliding electrodes that short-circuit the positively charged cornea to the extra-ocular skin. Rotation of the eyeballs, and consequently of the corneo-retinal dipole, increases the potential in electrodes towards which the eyes are rotated, and decrease the potentials in the opposing electrodes. Eye movements called saccades also generate transient electromyographic potentials, known as saccadic spike potentials (SPs). The spectrum of these SPs overlaps the gamma-band (see Gamma wave), and seriously confounds analysis of induced gamma-band responses, requiring tailored artifact correction approaches. Purposeful or reflexive eye blinking also generates electromyographic potentials, but more importantly there is reflexive movement of the eyeball during blinking that gives a characteristic artifactual appearance of the EEG (see Bell's phenomenon).|$|E

The evening gown Motorola selected for Mya to debut in was described by Digital Domain as the most difficult item of clothing they could have chosen, due to its transparency and layering. To render 150 frames (equating to 5–6 seconds of actual footage) of Mya moving in the gown in low-resolution required approximately 6 hours of processing time; the final high-resolution shots took longer.
