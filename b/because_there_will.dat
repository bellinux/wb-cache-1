500|$|The band {{started in}} Bellflower, California in 2007. During its early days, {{the band played}} several live shows in the California area, {{as well as in}} Tecate, Mexico. Their eponymous first album The Boxmasters was {{released}} on June 10, 2008 by Vanguard Records. It received a mostly poor review from Allmusic, which stated that [...] "The Boxmasters might work live <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be visuals; but merely as a listening exercise, it's best taken in small doses so the novelty doesn't wear off." [...] The review also alleged that [...] "Thornton can't drum to save his life, and he can't sing". The Washington Post praised the album, and the paper remarked that listeners will get their money's worth if they enjoy the music even half as much as the band did during the recordings.|$|E

I should have thought that there must be a pretty large number there." [...] High replies that it is true there are a pretty large number of men there, adding many more have yet to arrive, yet that [...] "there will seem too few when the wolf comes." [...] However, High adds that food is not a problem <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> never be too many people in Valhalla that the meat of Sæhrímnir (which he calls a boar) cannot sufficiently feed. High says that Sæhrímnir is cooked every day by the cook Andhrímnir in the pot Eldhrimnir, and is again whole every evening. High then quotes the stanza of Grímnismál mentioning the cook, meal, and container in reference.|$|E

It's an amazing opportunity and I'm really enjoying tackling a character like Leon who has so much going on," [...] He prepared for the role by attending a gym, as the character has a lot of topless scenes.

Consequently, the pressure on students from teachers and parents is intense, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be only one test per year.

2500|$|Currently, {{there is}} a new field of gaming called Neurogaming, which uses {{non-invasive}} BCI in order to improve gameplay so that users can interact with a console without the use of a traditional controller. Some Neurogaming software use a player's brain waves, heart rate, expressions, pupil dilation, and even emotions to complete tasks or affect the mood of the game. For example, game developers at Emotiv have created non-invasive BCI that will determine the mood of a player and adjust music or scenery accordingly. This new form of interaction between player and software will enable a player to have a more realistic gaming experience. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be less disconnect between a player and console, Neurogaming will allow individuals to utilize their [...] "psychological state" [...] and have their reactions transfer to games in real-time.|$|E

5000|$|In this light, the {{ecological}} {{vision of a}} [...] "zero-growth society" [...] appears rather utopian; or, at the very least, its achievement would require the abolition of capitalism. Some would argue that population growth makes economic growth absolutely necessary.

The real argument, though, is not about growth or the lack thereof, but rather {{about the kind of}} growth that is best for the (enlarged) reproduction of the human species as such. Ecologists may validly argue that some types of growth undermine important conditions for human survival in the longer term without invalidating other kinds of growth that are beneficial. However, there is much dispute about which kinds of economic growth are beneficial or harmful.|$|R
