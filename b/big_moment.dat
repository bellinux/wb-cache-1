It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the twelfth best episode of the show with a sports theme (sport fishing). The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the Homer vs. Marge plot was [...] "good on its own", {{but it was also}} [...] "Grampa's <b>big</b> <b>moment.</b> His final revelation to Bart and Lisa is inspired."

Happily, it didn’t, as the show provided a consistently high level of entertainment. Between Homer’s excesses at marriage camp and the kids’ antics while Grampa watches them, the program packed in a ton of great gags." ...|$|E

That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a <b>big</b> <b>moment</b> or a small moment. We tried a lot of different things, but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be.

[...] Poniewozik enjoyed the reveal of the documentary crew. However, he wrote that, [...] "I don't know if I'm going to like the idea of making Brian an actual player in the events, if indeed that's where the show is going."

2500|$|In {{his regular}} season debut, Luck threw his first career {{interception}} to Chicago Bears cornerback Tim Jennings. He would later throw his first career {{touchdown pass to}} Donnie Avery. Ultimately, Luck completed 23 of 45 passes for 309 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions, as the Colts lost 41–21. The next week against the Minnesota Vikings, Luck threw for 224 {{yards and two touchdowns}} with no interceptions. Additionally, Luck got his first career win in the NFL and did this by completing his first game-winning drive of his professional career. Before a week 5 showdown with the Green Bay Packers and reigning MVP Aaron Rodgers, Colts head coach Chuck Pagano was diagnosed with leukemia and had to take a leave of absence. Rallying the team for their coach (a movement that become known as [...] "CHUCKSTRONG") Luck completed his second career game-winning drive by throwing a touchdown to Reggie Wayne with 35 seconds left to pull off the stunning upset. Luck's then career-best 362-yard passing effort set a new rookie QB mark in Colts franchise history. The 18-point comeback also was the best by a rookie quarterback since Matthew Stafford, the first pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, led a 21-point rally for the Lions vs. the Browns in 2009. Luck completed 31 of 55 for 362 yards and three total touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing). Luck won his first career road and overtime game during a week 8 game against the division rival Tennessee Titans. A touchdown pass to running back Vick Ballard on the first drive of overtime gave the Colts a 19–13 victory. In a week 9 win against the Miami Dolphins, Luck threw for 433 yards, a new record for most yards in a game by a rookie QB (surpassing Cam Newton's 432 against the Green Bay Packers in 2011). Luck later sent his jersey from the Dolphins game to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Through Week 9, Luck had thrown for the same number of yards as his predecessor, Peyton Manning. In Week 13 against the Detroit Lions, Luck and the Colts were trailing 33–21 with 2:39 left. After throwing a touchdown to fellow rookie LaVon Brazill, Luck and the Colts were able to get the ball back and get to the Lions' 14-yard line, facing a 4th down with [...] :04 left. Luck then threw a screen pass to Donnie Avery who got free and ran in for the winning score, marking a <b>big</b> <b>moment</b> in Luck's early career. The win gave Luck his eighth on the season – the most wins by a rookie quarterback drafted first overall in NFL history, as well as his fifth game-winning drive on the season, tying Vince Young and Ben Roethlisberger for the most by a rookie quarterback. On December 23, 2012, Luck broke the record for most passing yards in a season by a rookie against the Kansas City Chiefs, throwing 205 to bring his season total to 4,183. Cam Newton held the previous record with 4,051 yards.|$|E
