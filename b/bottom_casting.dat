This was the first Bessemer steel plant to be operated in the United States. He remained in charge of the Wyandotte Bessemer Works until 1866, when he returned to Johnstown where the Cambria Co. was erecting a Bessemer plant. Since the construction of this factory was not completed until July 1871, Cambria placed Hunt in charge of the process of rolling steel ingots into rail tracks for use by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Once the Cambria Bessemer plant was put into operation, Hunt, along with John E. Fry and Alexander L.

40|$|Summary In this work, {{the effect}} of phosphorus, as a primary silicon refiner, and of strontium, as a {{eutectic}} silicon modifier, individually and simultaneously, on the microstructure ofhypereutectic AI-Si alloys was studied. AI- 18. 6 Si- 0. 35 Fe- 0. 02 Cu- 0. 0014 P (wt%) alloy was used for casting and phosphorus was added {{in a range of}} 0. 015 - 0. 08 wt% mainly by means of AI- 6. 75 Fe 4. 91 P (wt %), and in a few cases by AI- 17. lCu- 0. 89 P (wt%), master alloys. Eutectic silicon was modified using AI- 5. 93 wt% Sr over a range of 0. 04 - 0. 3 wt% Sr. Two different casting methods were used: <b>bottom</b> <b>casting</b> into sand moulds and chamber casting into steel moulds. The melt temperature was 800 aC and holding time for each addition was 15 min. Adding 0. 02 wt% P led to {{an increase in the number}} of primary silicon particles per unit volume (NV) by 1. 5 times. NV was trebled by adding 0. 08 wt% phosphorus during chamber casting into steel moulds. NV was decreased by about 20 times by adding 0. 2 wt% Sr and 0. 02 wt% Sr+ 0. 02 wt% P to untreated alloy during <b>bottom</b> <b>casting</b> into a sand mould. Adding strontium increased primary silicon undercooling from 7. lÃ‚Â± 1. 0 to 46. 6 Ã‚Â± 6. 5 K, though phosphorus addition of 0. 02, 0. 04 and 0. 08 wt% (for ingots chamber cast into steel moulds) gave a primary silicon undercooling of 18. 7 Ã‚Â± 10 A, 8. 5 Ã‚Â± 1. 2 and 9. lÃ‚Â± 0. 9 K respectively (compared to 9. 0 Ã‚Â± 5. 0 K for untreated ingots). The nucleation models (one surface-dependant and the other volumedependant) of Perepezko were applied to the observed nucleation behaviour of primary silicon. It was found that the nucleation temperature was the most crucial variable in both models. Applying the models to our results showed that contact angle from the surface-dependant model varied over the range of 24. 3 to 30 degrees, compared with 17. 7 to 23. 5 degrees from the volume-dependant model. Additionally, Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) was used to determine possible crystallographic relationships between neighbouring primary silicons in untreated and P-inoculated ingots. Between two connected primary silicon particles, the outermost layers of each silicon particle were often found to be twin-related by a 60 Ã‚Â° rotation around axis.

Design/methodology/approach: The experimental ingot 8 K 91 SF weighing almost 90 tons was cast due the performance a detailed analysis of the current state of casting and solidification. The ingot was cut and macrostructure and chemical heterogeneity of the ingot was evaluated in detail. The standard method used in metallurgical analytics - analyses using optical emission spectrometers - was not applicable due to the large number of required analyzes. Thus, the mobile optical spectrometer SPECRTOTEST was used. Sulfur prints and fluid penetration tests were performed due to detect macroscopic distribution of sulfur and to locate surface-breaking defects. Findings: Current level of segregations of selected elements in real 90 -ton steel ingot was detected. Also mutual mixing of two heats needed for the production of this ingot was verified. Research limitations/implications: Future research is focused on determination of inclusion content in selected parts of experimental ingot and on the level of micro-segregations. We are limited by the accuracy of chosen analytical method, which is also discussed in the paper. Practical implications: The gained knowledge is used to specification of the setting of boundary conditions of the numerical simulations, which should help to optimize the production technology of casting heavy forging ingots and minimize the level of segregation in ingots. Originality/value: New knowledge concerning mutual mixing of two heats needed for <b>bottom</b> <b>casting</b> of heavy forging ingot are presented in this paper. Distribution of segregation in so heavy ingot was detected.

This {{was the first time}} the strain distribution of epoxycoated rebar had been measured. Ninety-six inverted half-beam specimens were tested while monitoring load, initial cracking load, free-end slip, and loaded-end slip. Four of the 96 specimens (2 uncoated, 2 epoxy-coated) had test bars with internally embedded strain gages. All of the specimens were designed to fail in bond by splitting of the concrete.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} renovation of aerial aluminum alloy (LY 12 CZ) by laser melt casting with Al matrix composite powder. The microstructure of the melt casting zone was investigated, and the fatigue contrast test was carried out between the repaired specimens and the undamaged specimens. It is found that the melt casting zone consists of equiaxed crystals and columnar crystals. The equiaxed crystals distribute in the deposited layer and the crystal size is about 3 ~ 4 µm. The columnar crystals whose axial direction size comes to 30 µm~ 40 µm exist near the interface with its crystallographic axis perpendicular to the interface. The fatigue life of specimens repaired by laser melt casting was shorter than no-damage specimens to a large extant, because of the flaws in the deposited layer engendered the origins of cracks; the columnar shape grains at the <b>bottom</b> of <b>casting</b> zone were easy to split under the tensile stress; the residual stress after the melt casting accelerated the initiation and growth of the cracks...|$|R

Fishing rods with baited hooks and fishing lines used in various ways are used for fishing for some particular types of fish. Fishing using nets like cast nets, hand nets, drift nets, gillnets, seine nets, trawl nets, surrounding nets etc. of various sizes and construction as well as longline fishing with hundreds of hooks on a line fishing both for bottom and pelagic fish (near surface fish) are the most common devices used to catch high yields of fish. The crab fisheries uses crab pots baited with dead fish to catch crabs.In some parts of the Pacific Northwest, fishing with baited traps is also common. Common commercial methods for catching shrimp and prawns include <b>bottom</b> trawling, <b>cast</b> nets, seines, shrimp baiting and dip netting. Bottom trawling often tears up the ocean bottom and can be very destructive to all bottom dwelling fish. Trawling involves the use of a system of nets deployed on or near the sea floor. Benthic trawling is towing or dragging a net at the very bottom of the ocean. Demersal trawling is towing a net just above the benthic zone. Midwater trawling (pelagic trawling) is trawling, or net fishing nearer the surface of the ocean.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Macrosegregation {{occurs in}} casting the most case is {{as a result}} of slow {{interdendritic}} flow due to shrinkage geometry, solid deformation or gravity. In some cases could be the result of solid movement {{in the early stages of}} solidification[1]. The problem is that the observation of macrosegregation in steel material is not easy because of high temperature condition. This recent work uses low melting temperature material alloy to simulate the actual condition as a model material. Various efforts to prevent macrosegregation are aimed to control liquid flow and movement of solid, one of them is by cooling rate controling. In this experiment the mold is cooled in three types of cooling medias to represent three different cooling conditions in order to observe the influence of cooling rate on macrosegregation during solidification of the alloy. The outer part close to the mold wall and the <b>bottom</b> of <b>casting</b> contains less solute than inner location. This occurs in all cooling conditions but cooling rate can cause the solute in casting distributed differently. At high cooling rate condition, distribution of Bi rich grain is more uniform. It is mean that macrosegregation is reduced. Bi-richer grains accumulate at the bottom of the ingot. It could be caused by those grains settle due to their relative density to surrounding liquid during solidification...|$|R
