5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Zygoballus rufipes, with whom its range overlaps. The male can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from Z.rufipes by the large spot of white scales {{at the beginning of}} the thoracic slope (which is lacking in Z. rufipes), and by the longitudinal division present on the bulb of the pedipalp (Z. rufipes has a transverse division). The female can best <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> by the form of the epigyne (the external genital structure).|$|E
5|$|Altar 3 {{was found}} in the {{northern}} part of the East Plaza, where it was associated with Stela 4. It was sculpted although it is now badly eroded. It bears the images of two seated anthropomorphic figures but further details cannot <b>be</b> <b>distinguished.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{lookalike}} {{species is}} Suillus subaureus, which can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> microscopically by slightly smaller, hyaline (translucent) spores (typically 7.5–8.5 by 3µm), and an association with Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides).|$|E

40|$|Two {{new species}} of Hypostomus Lacépède (Teleostei: Loricariidae) from the rio Paranaíba and rio Grande basins, both in the upper rio Paraná basin, central Brazil, are {{described}} herein. One of them <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> from all congeners, except H. albopunctatus, by having the pectoral-fin spine length equal to or smaller than the pelvic-fin spine. From H. albopunctatus, it <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> by having round dark spots (vs. pale) on body and fins. The second species <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> from all congeners, except H. multidens and H. ternetzi, by having more than 115 teeth (vs. less than 109) per ramus on dentary and premaxilla. It <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> most readily from H. ternetzi by having teeth with two symmetrical (vs. asymmetrical) cusps. It <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> from H. multidens by having round dark spots (vs. pale) over body and fins...|$|R

5|$|Antrodia serialiformis {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to A.serialis, but the latter has larger spores (6.3–8 by 2.2–3.3µm). The two can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> in the field by their substrate preferences: while A.serialis usually fruits on coniferous wood, A.serialiformis grows strictly on old decorticated oak trunks.|$|E
5|$|Coyote tracks can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> {{from those}} of dogs by their more elongated, less rounded shape. Unlike dogs, the upper canines of coyotes extends past the mental foramina.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{the adults}} may be {{confused}} with large native frogs from the genera Limnodynastes, Cyclorana, and Mixophyes. These species can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from the cane toad {{by the absence of}} large parotoid glands behind their eyes and the lack of a ridge between the nostril and the eye. Cane toads have been confused with the giant burrowing frog (Heleioporus australiacus), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) irises. Juvenile cane toads may {{be confused with}} species of the Uperoleia genus, but their adult colleagues can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> by the lack of bright colouring on the groin and thighs.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{the cane}} toad closely resembles many bufonid species. In particular, {{it could be}} {{confused}} with the southern toad (Bufo terrestris), which can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> by the presence of two bulbs in front of the parotoid glands.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, X.bracteatum can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from X.bicolor in Tasmania by its broader {{leaves and}} cobwebby {{hairs on the}} stems, and from X.macranthum in Western Australia by the flower head colour; the latter species has white flower heads whereas those of X.bracteatum are golden yellow. Xerochrysum subundulatum from alpine and subalpine areas of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania is rhizomatous, and has {{markedly}} pointed orange bracts. The eastern Australian species X. viscosum may <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> by its rough and sticky leaves.|$|E

5|$|It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} {{to a number of}} Amanita species. It can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from A.praegraveolens microscopically by the absence of clamp connections between the cells in S.thiersii. Both S.thiersii and A.aureofloccosa have hollow stems but the latter has a more tapering stipe and the whole fruit body is yellower. A.silvifuga is another species that grows in similar locations in grassland in Texas and H. D. Thiers described the taste of both it and A. thiersii as being bitter. It can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> by its darker coloration and more warted appearance.|$|E
5|$|Leccinellum albellum {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.holopus, but grows in association with oak and has a more southerly distribution. L.scabrum is a widely distributed lookalike that can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from L.holopus by its larger size and generally darker colors.|$|E

5|$|Similar fungi with simple, white fruit bodies include Clavaria acuta, {{an equally}} {{widespread}} species that typically grows singly {{or in small}} groups rather than in dense clusters and can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> microscopically by its clamped basidia and larger spores; the morphologically similar, but rare C.atkinsoniana, found in the southwestern and central United States, which cannot <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from C.fragilis by field characteristics alone but has larger spores—8.5–10 by 4.5–5µm; C.rubicundula, another North American species, which is similar in stature but has a reddish tint; and Multiclavula mucida, a widespread lichenized species with smaller fruit bodies that occurs with its associated algae on moist wood.|$|E
5|$|Sphecius grandis can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> from S.convallis (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the {{coloration}} {{pattern of}} the gastral tergites. Formerly, the two species were distinguished {{on the basis of}} the number of tergites with yellow markings (five in S.grandis and three in S.convallis), but a more recent study showed that this character was insufficient to distinguish the two species. However, they can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> by the density of the punctation on the first and second tergites.|$|E
