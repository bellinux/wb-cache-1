40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} maximizing a nonnegative (possibly non-monotone) submodular set function with or without constraints. Feige et al. [9] showed a 2 / 5 -approximation for the unconstrained problem and also proved that no approximation better than 1 / 2 is possible in the value oracle model. Constant-factor approximation has been also known for submodular maximization subject to a matroid independence constraint (a factor of 0. 309 [33]) and for submodular maximization subject to a matroid <b>base</b> <b>constraint,</b> provided that the fractional base packing number ν is bounded away from 1 (a 1 / 4 -approximation assuming that ν ≥ 2 [33]). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for submodular maximization {{which is based on}} the idea of simulated annealing. We prove that this algorithm achieves improved approximation for two problems: a 0. 41 -approximation for unconstrained submodular maximization, and a 0. 325 approximation for submodular maximization subject to a matroid independence constraint. On the hardness side, we show that in the value oracle model it is impossible to achieve a 0. 478 -approximation for submodular maximization subject to a matroid independence constraint, or a 0. 394 -approximation subject to a matroid <b>base</b> <b>constraint</b> in matroids with two disjoint bases. Even for the special case of cardinality constraint, we prove it is impossible to achieve a 0. 491 -approximation. (Previously it was conceivable that a 1 / 2 -approximation exists for these problems.) It is still an open question whether a 1 / 2 -approximation is possible for unconstrained submodular maximization. ...|$|E
40|$|We present {{concentration}} bounds for linear {{functions of}} random variables {{arising from the}} pipage rounding procedure on matroid polytopes. As an application, we give a (1 − 1 /e − ɛ) -approximation algorithm for the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to 1 matroid and k linear constraints, for any constant k ≥ 1 and ɛ> 0. This generalizes the result for k linear constraints by Kulik et al. [11]. We also give the same result for a super-constant number k of ”loose ” linear constraints, where the right-hand side dominates the matrix entries by an Ω(ɛ − 2 log k) factor. As another application, we present a general result on minimax packing problems that involve a matroid <b>base</b> <b>constraint.</b> An example is the multi-path routing problem with integer demands for pairs of vertices; {{the goal is to}} minimize congestion.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{assertion}} language for expressing properties of data structures. Its key features are constraints over arrays, multisets and integers which allow the specification of basic assertions, and rules, which allow the recursive specification of assertions. This language {{can thus be}} used to define assertions to an arbitrary level of expressiveness, ranging from low-level properties of memory allocation, for example, to abstract properties of complex data structures such as AVL trees. The main result is a proof method for verification conditions arising from a program annotated with assertions. The method has two main components. First and foremost is an unfolding algorithm which works by reducing the recursive definitions so that a constraint proof may now be applied. Here we introduce a notion of coinduction which forms the basis for termination of the unfolding process. The second step {{is to reduce the}} constraints, which in general contain expressions involving all the three data types of integers, arrays and multisets, into a <b>base</b> <b>constraint</b> involving only integer constraints. Base constraints can then be dispensed with available solvers. We finally show via a small benchmark of classic examples that our proof method is practical. 1...|$|E

The results show that the stereo <b>base</b> <b>constraint</b> has effect ouver the convergence estimation, but does it neither improves the object point coordinate estimation at significance level of 5 % and nor it influences the interior orientation parameters. Finally, it has been noticed that the optical axes are not truly parallel to each other and orthogonal to the stereo base.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a static (intraprocedural) analysis for analyzing heap-manipulating programs (in presence of recursive data structures and pointer arithmetic) in languages like C or low-level code. This analysis {{can be used}} for checking memory-safety, memory leaks, and user specified assertions. We first propose a rich abstract domain for representing useful invariants about such programs. This abstract domain allows representation of must and may equalities among pointer expressions. The integer variables used in the pointer expressions can be existentially as well as universally quantified and can have constraints over some base domain. We allow quantification of a special form, namely ∃ ∀ quantification. This choice has been made to balance expressiveness with efficient automated deduction. The existential quantification is over some ghost variables of programs, which are automatically made explicit by our analysis to express useful program invariants. The universal quantifier is used to express properties of collections of memory locations. We then show how to perform sound abstract interpretation over this abstract domain. We give transfer functions for performing join, meet, and postcondition operations over this abstract domain. The basis of all these operations is an abstract interpreter for the quantifier-free <b>base</b> <b>constraint</b> domain (eg., the conjunctive domain of linear arithmetic combined with uninterpreted functions). To our knowledge, this is the first abstract interpreter that can automatically deduce first-order logic invariants in programs (without requiring any explicit predicates). We also present initial experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our ideas on some common coding patterns...|$|E
40|$|Motivated {{by several}} applications, we {{consider}} the problem of randomly rounding a fractional solution in a matroid (base) polytope to an integral one. We consider the pipage rounding technique [5, 6, 36] and also present a new technique, randomized swap rounding. Our main technical results are concentration bounds for functions of random variables arising from these rounding techniques. We prove Chernofftype concentration bounds for linear functions of random variables arising from both techniques, and also a lower-tail exponential bound for monotone submodular functions of variables arising from randomized swap rounding. The following are examples of our applications. • We give a (1 − 1 /e−ε) -approximation algorithm for the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to 1 matroid and k linear constraints, for any constant k ≥ 1 and ε> 0. We also give the same result for a super-constant number k of ”loose ” linear constraints, where the right-hand side dominates the matrix entries by an Ω(ε − 2 log k) factor. • We present a result on minimax packing problems that involve a matroid <b>base</b> <b>constraint.</b> We give an O(log m / log log m) -approximation for the general problem min{λ: ∃x ∈ { 0, 1 } N, x ∈ B(M), Ax ≤ λb} where m {{is the number of}} packing constraints.
