5000|$|The [...] "Duke of York's Men" [...] can <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> {{to fetch}} 20,000 points, by {{reference}} to the nursery rhyme, but can also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> to score only four points as the name does not specify how many men. Similarly, [...] "The Beehive" [...] could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> to equal 60000 points, as there {{would be at least}} 10,000 bees in a beehive; conversely it could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> to gain twelve points as the number of bees are not specified. It could also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the beehive is the hive itself and therefore scores no points.|$|R

It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> against the first premise that the underdetermination must be strong and/or inductive. It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> against the second premise that there is evidence for a theory's truth besides observations; for example, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that simplicity, explanatory power or some other feature of a theory is evidence for it over its rivals.|$|R

5|$|It {{has also}} <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> against folk {{psychology}} that the intentionality of mental states like belief imply {{that they have}} semantic qualities.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} of whether poverty as such violates the dignity of persons. It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that it does.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that {{learning}} in practice {{is situated in}} processes of conflictual cooperation. The paper gives a short outline of human rationality {{as a matter of}} following plans and it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> how this perspective is mirrored in some of the dominant conventional learning theories. Inspired by Lave and Wenger’s (1991) approach to situated learning the heterogeneous aspect of practice is highlighted and it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that we analytically need to distinguish between learning to master specific elements in various communities of practice and to orient oneself in a multiple-contextual practice. Finally, by using an example from our preliminary study of building a house it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that learning most be seeing a part of processes of conflict and cooperation...|$|R

5|$|Michel Launey {{argues that}} Classical Nahuatl had a verb-initial basic word order with {{extensive}} freedom for variation, {{which was then}} used to encode pragmatic functions such as focus and topicality. The same has <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> for some contemporary varieties.|$|E
5|$|The Roman era of Switzerland is {{traditionally}} held to have ended in 401AD, when Stilicho withdrew all {{troops from the}} Rhine and the Danube.

5|$|After Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have {{proposed}} to France a preventive war against Germany. It has <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany. Lack of French interest may have been a reason why Poland signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934. Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced.|$|E
5|$|After a {{long and}} zealously pious life, Cædmon died like a saint: {{receiving}} a premonition of death, he asked to be moved to the abbey's hospice for the terminally ill where, having gathered his friends around him, he died after receiving the Holy Eucharist, just before nocturns. Although he is often listed as a saint, this is not confirmed by Bede and it has recently <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that such assertions are incorrect.|$|E

40|$|It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl <b>was</b> an “externalist” in {{at least}} one sense. For it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl held that {{genuinely}} perceptual experiences—that is to say, experiences that are of some real object in the world—differ intrinsically, essentially and as a kind from any hallucinatory experiences. There is, therefore, no neutral “content” that such perceptual experiences share with hallucinations, differing from them only over whether some additional non-psychological condition holds or not. In short, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl <b>was</b> a “disjunctivist”. In addition, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl held that the individual object of any experience, perceptual or hallucinatory, is essential to and partly constitutive of that experience. The argument focuses on three aspects of Husserl’s thought: his account of intentional objects, his notion of horizon, and his account of reality...|$|R

5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the Arabic {{astronomer}} and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that it has <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.|$|E
5|$|Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At {{a site in}} Chaco Canyon can {{be found}} a {{pictograph}} with a star, crescent and hand. It has <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> by some astronomers {{that this is a}} record of the 1054 Supernova. However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The Zuni people, who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.|$|E

The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate.

5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology and empirical clinical observation.
