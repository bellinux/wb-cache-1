Part 1 deals with the preparation of thin films and sub-micron powders of complex metal oxides by nebulized spray pyrolysis (NSP) and Part 2 {{consists of}} Brillouin scattering studies of solid materials exhibiting interesting phase transitions. The simple technique of NSP has been employed to prepare thin films of A 12 O 3, PbTiO 3, Pb(Zr 0. 5 Ti 0. 5) O 3 (PZT) and PbZrO 3 on single crystal substrate. The films were characterized by various techniques for their composition, structure, morphology and dielectric properties. Ferroelectric (FE) films of the configuration FE/LaNiO 3 /SiO 2 /Si (FE = PbTiO 3 and PZT), wherein the LaNiO 3 <b>barrier</b> <b>electrode</b> was also deposited on the SiO 2 /Si substrate by NSP, have been investigated. The films exhibit satisfactory ferroelectric properties. PbZrO 3 films deposited on LaNiO 3 /SiO 2 /Si substrates show good features, including a reversible AFE ↔ FE transition. Sub-micron particles of TiO 2, ZrO 2, Pb(Zr 0. 5 Ti 0. 5) O 3, Al 2 O 3, S 1 O 2 and mullite have been prepared by NSP and characterized by various techniques. Brillouin scattering has been used, for the first time, not only to characterize the Peierls transition but also the incommensurate to commensurate transition in the one-dimensional blue bronze, K 0. 3 M 0 O 3.

40|$|Dynamic {{properties}} of the air/water interface were explored using Langmuir monolayer methods, ring and drop shape tensiometry, Brewster angle microscopy, and above all, cyclic voltammetry with 2 D line and barrier microelectrodes. The goal is to gain insight into the rate of lateral self-diffusion of water molecules in the air/water interfacial region, defined as the space in which water transitions from 90 to 10 percent of its bulk density. Because measuring the rate of water self-diffusion directly is experimentally impossible, 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidnyl- 1 -oxy (TEMPO) was employed as a surfactant probe molecule. The dynamics and kinetics of TEMPO partitioning to the interface were thoroughly investigated {{under a variety of}} conditions. TEMPO was found to have a partition constant of 380 ± 30 M - 1 in solutions of 1 mM HClO 4 and 2 mM LiClO 4. The partition constant of TEMPO can be adjusted by synthesizing derivatives of varying hydrophobicity at the C- 4 position in the carbon ring. Placing a hydoxy group results in a compound that does not partition to the air/water interface. Adding an ethyl group results in approximately an order of magnitude increase of the partition constant. The first attempts to determine the lateral diffusion coefficient of TEMPO (D surf) employed 2 D line microelectrodes. However, these measurements were found to be insufficient for determining D surf of TEMPO for several reasons. The kinetics of TEMPO partitioning to the interface are fast relative to the experiment. This allows the surface population of TEMPO, as it is oxidized to TEMPO +, to be replenished by the solution population of TEMPO, thereby enhancing the surface current. It is therefore impossible to independently determine Dsurf without knowing the desorption rate constant, k des. Numerical simulation with COMSOL Multiphysics allowed us to obtain a number of D surf, k des pairs, and a calibration plot was created showing possible values of D surf as a function of k des for 2 D line microelectrodes. The limitation of 2 D line microelectrodes is that they exhibit degradation of the voltammetric signal over the time scale of our experiment (15 - 45 s), burdening the experiment with a systematic negative error. The characteristics of the signal decay indicate that it stems from a loss of the gold/air/solution triple phase line, thereby preventing electrooxidation of TEMPO from occurring precisely at the microline. A variety of mechanisms were hypothesized and tested to determine the exact cause of signal decay, with the aim of either eliminating it or finding a correction term to account for it. No hypothesis was successfully confirmed as the cause of decay. Because decay was a function of time the line electrode was in contact with solution, faster scan rates were preferred, typically 50 mV/s. The calibration curve obtained from 2 D line microelectrodes was taken as a lower bound value for D surf. For values of kdes > 10 3 s- 1, the dependence of the value of D surf on k des becomes small, and the calibration curve obtained for 2 D line microelectrodes gave a value of 8 ± 4 cm 2 /s for D surf in this region. Further experiments were designed to more accurately determine the value of D surf. This was done by modifying the <b>electrode</b> geometry. Thin <b>barrier</b> films were placed over the gold surface that prevented direct electrooxidation at the microline. Surface adsorbed TEMPO is still able to influence the voltammetric signal by desorbing to replace TEMPO that has been oxidized in the bulk solution. This allowed the creation of a set of independent calibration curves and the identification of a point of intersection, thereby determining both D surf and k des. Two types of barrier films were employed: spin coated SU- 8 photoresist and vapor deposited silicon monoxide. The first type of film employed was the SU- 8 photoresist. SU- 8 barrier films provided high reproducibility, but there was uncertainty as to the rigidity of the polymer film after breaking. Vapor deposited silicon monoxide was chosen as an alternative barrier film due to its ease of fabrication and greater confidence in its rigidity. Silicon monoxide barrier films were thoroughly characterized and found to break unevenly at the point of contact with solution. Due to their unusual breaking characteristics, SiO <b>barrier</b> <b>electrodes</b> had to be calibrated with a non-partitioning electroactive analyte. Both types of films generated calibration plots that intersected to yield D surf values of 7 ± 3 × 10 - 5 cm 2 /s. However, calibration curves obtained from simulating experiments performed with SU- 8 <b>barrier</b> <b>electrodes</b> intersected at a k des value of 10 4 s - 1, while the curves obtained using results from SiO barrier films intersected at a k des value of 10 3 s - 1. Resolving the discrepancy between these two values is a possible direction for a future project. It is encouraging to note the remarkably good agreement between the values of D surf obtained from the 2 D microline experiments and the <b>barrier</b> <b>electrodes.</b> This value for D surf is approximately a factor of 4 greater than the value obtained by Pohorille and Wilson in MD simulations. Applying the 2 D diffusive model described by Hughes and coworkers, the viscosity of the air/water interfacial region is estimated to be one third of the viscosity of bulk water...|$|R

Although, various strategies were adopted but still results are far from required values for their practical usage. Here, we have designed a unique structure to prevent surface reaction and structural disintegration meanwhile intrinsic conductivity is improved to involve all redox sites in conversion reaction. CoSnx@C-PAn hybrid was synthesized through aqueous chemical route, Co doping in tin make accessible all redox sites by faster conduction of electrons while its hard nature relaxes internal stress, carbon shell prevents surface reaction and brings well control on solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film by maintaining <b>barrier</b> between <b>electrode</b> surface and electrolyte and nitrogen doped porous carbon provides faster diffusion of Li+ deep in electrode make possible high mass loadings and conduction highway for electrons. Furthermore, porous carbon also provides room to compensate volume expansion and keeps electrode structure stable. Because of its unique structure hybrid shows excellent reversible capacity of 2044 mAh/g (retention 100 %) with mass loading of 3. 8 mg/cm 2 along with long cyclic life up to 1000 cycles and bears high rate capability (20 A/g). We believe that present study makes possible the use of high capacity materials in applications...|$|R
30|$|In summary, we have {{examined}} two different methods for contacting nanowires {{widely used in}} the nanotechnology field. The roughness of SiNWs obtained via MACE hinders the wiring process. Our comparative study allows to underline some relevant feature of the two techniques. FIB/GIS method is efficient in terms of electrical contact on the silicon nanowires even if it requires lots of effort for limiting the contamination of the surface. We have found a partial solution using nanowires longer than 4.0  μm and restricting the exposure to the ion beam as low as possible. EBL technique is much more clean but does not eliminate the Schottky <b>barrier</b> between the <b>electrode</b> and the nanowire. Nevertheless, this method introduces some chemical steps that could alter the electrical properties of the silicon nanowires, especially if their surface contains pores.|$|R
