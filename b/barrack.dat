5|$|The {{chief of}} {{construction}} of Auschwitz II-Birkenau was Karl Bischoff. Unlike his predecessor, {{he was a}} competent and dynamic bureaucrat who, {{in spite of the}} ongoing war, carried out the construction deemed necessary. The Birkenau camp, the four crematoria, a new reception building, and hundreds of other buildings were planned and constructed. Bischoff's plans called for each <b>barrack</b> to have an occupancy of 550 prisoners (one-third of the space allotted in other Nazi concentration camps). He later changed this to 744 prisoners per <b>barrack.</b> The SS designed the barracks not so much to house people as to destroy them.|$|E
5|$|Visits {{can be made}} to the island. The trust runs day-long boat trips from Weston-super-Mare. One <b>barrack</b> {{block is}} in use to provide visitor facilities. In 1980 the Bollywood film Shaan was set and {{partially}} filmed on the island.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>barracked</b> police, Kasernierte Polizei, was a {{predecessor}} of today’s German Bereitschaftspolizei. It was normally {{organized in}} company-sized units (Hundertschaften) in larger cities. During the war, the <b>barracked</b> police formed the core {{for the police}} battalions serving in the occupied countries and in the German army rear.|$|R
40|$|Before we commit {{ourselves}} to <b>barracking</b> for Waltzing Matilda as our new national anthem, {{it would be}} as well to know exactly what we are <b>barracking</b> for. There is quite a list of different Matildas to choose from; and now, thanks to the devoted research of Mr. Richard Magoffin, we can put them into chronological order...|$|R
5|$|A Piazza {{is located}} inside the fort, and it {{contains}} the rebuilt Chapel of St. Anthony of Padua, several <b>barrack</b> blocks, an armoury and other buildings. A statue of Grand Master Vilhena once {{stood in the}} square but it was removed in the 19th century and relocated to Valletta. It was later relocated once again {{and it is now}} in Floriana.|$|E
5|$|Defence of Tigné Point {{was further}} {{enhanced}} {{with the construction}} of Cambridge Battery between 1878 and 1886. Garden Battery was then built between 1889 and 1894, covering the area between Cambridge Battery and Fort Tigné. <b>Barrack</b> blocks were constructed {{on the rest of the}} peninsula in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row {{were sold}} to Springdale {{businessmen}} Roy Joyce and Jim <b>Barrack.</b> Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.|$|E

5|$|On July 20, 1944, Stauffenberg and his {{adjutant}} Lieutenant Haeften {{return to}} Wolf's Lair. To Stauffenberg's dismay, he discovers {{only after the}} timer has been activated that, due to the warm weather, the conference {{is being held in}} an open-window summer <b>barrack,</b> whereas the plotters had intended to detonate the bomb within the walls of the bunker for maximum damage. While his adjutant waits with the car, Stauffenberg places the briefcase with the bomb armed at the meeting as close to Hitler as possible. Stauffenberg then leaves the <b>barrack,</b> returning to the car. However, one of the officers at the meeting moves the bomb behind a table leg, which will inadvertently protect Hitler from most of the blast. When the bomb explodes, Stauffenberg is certain that Hitler is dead and flees Wolf's Lair. Before shutting down communications, Fellgiebel calls Mertz about the explosion but cannot clearly convey whether or not Hitler is dead.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} to the south-west of the castle is a barracks block and associated storage buildings, constructed soon after 1718. Built to replace the original <b>barrack</b> accommodation within the castle when it was redeveloped to convert it into a magazine, it has changed little externally in the last 300 years. It is a rare surviving example of an 18th-century building of this type {{and was one of}} the first distinct barracks to be built in England.|$|E
5|$|Epiacum is in {{some ways}} a typical Roman fort: inside the wall are {{straight}} roads which cross, a headquarters building (the Praetorium), the commandant's house, a set of <b>barrack</b> blocks for the cohort of auxiliary soldiers, and granaries to store food. Also as usual, there is a bath house and a temple (dedicated by the auxiliaries to the Emperor Caracalla) outside the wall. There is an altar to Mithras and another, as already mentioned, to Hercules.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} about one mile north of Roe Green and close by there were sidings and a {{connection}} to the Bridgewater Estates colliery railway at <b>Barrack's</b> Tramway Junction.|$|R
2500|$|Ranjitsinhji's {{tour was}} {{controversial}} {{in one aspect}} only: {{a series of articles}} he wrote for an Australian magazine. Although highly self-critical in the articles, he criticised, among other things, the behaviour of the crowds, [...] the refusal of Australian critics to accept that England had to bat in poor conditions in the second Test, and some opposing players. He also supported the decision of an umpire to no ball some deliveries from Ernie Jones, in a match against Stoddart's team, for illegally [...] throwing the ball rather than bowling it. He generally very popular in Australia with crowds, the general public and influential figures in society, although he <b>barracked</b> but following these comments, the crowds at some matches <b>barracked</b> Ranjitsinhji while he was batting. At the end of the tour, he wrote an open letter to mend his relations with the Australian public, but in With Stodard's team in Australia, he wrote of the [...] "regrettable" [...] incident of [...] "merciless", [...] "uncomplimentary and insulting" [...] <b>barracking.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Basic Law of Hong Kong protects all {{civilians and}} civil affairs against any {{interference}} by the garrison. All military personnel, while stationed in Hong Kong, must remain within <b>barrack</b> grounds. When such personnel leave their barracks, they {{are subject to}} Hong Kong laws. The territory's police, who are civil servants, are responsible for maintaining public order; under exceptional circumstances, however, the police force may ask the central government of China for assistance from the garrison in disaster relief.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Service is reconstructing {{one of the}} 36 {{residential}} blocks as {{a demonstration}} block (Block 14, adjacent to and west of the Visitor Center). One <b>barrack</b> appears {{as it would have}} when Japanese Americans first arrived at Manzanar in 1942, while another has been reconstructed to represent barracks life in 1945. Exhibits in these barracks opened on April 16, 2015. A restored World War II mess hall, moved to the site from Bishop Airport in 2002, was opened to visitors in late 2010.|$|E
5|$|Early on 28 March 1944, a {{few minutes}} after midnight, a Junkers Ju88 crashed on the drive to the house after being shot down by cannon fire from a de Havilland Mosquito of No. 219 Squadron Royal Air Force. Hestercombe was the American 801 Hospital Centre after the Normandy {{landings}} {{until the end of the}} war. A total of 33 <b>barrack</b> huts (various Nissen huts, Romney huts and MOWB (Ministry of Works brick huts) were constructed at Hestercombe during the war. Many were demolished in the 1960s by the Crown Estate, and only one is left standing, in Rook Wood.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, the National Centre for Popular Music, {{a museum}} {{dedicated}} {{to the subject of}} popular music, was opened in the city. It was not as successful as was hoped, however, and later evolved to become a live music venue; then in February 2005, the unusual steel-covered building became the students' union for Sheffield Hallam University. Live music venues in the city include the Harley Hotel, Leadmill, West Street Live, the Boardwalk, Dove & Rainbow, The Casbah, The Cremorne, Corporation, New <b>Barrack</b> Tavern, The Broadfield Hotel, Redstone bar and nightclub, the City Hall, the University of Sheffield Students' Union, the Studio Theatre at the Crucible Theatre, the O2 Academy Sheffield and The Grapes.|$|E
5|$|In January 1981, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{planted a}} bomb in the Suvla <b>barrack</b> block at RAF Uxbridge. The device was {{discovered}} and the 35RAF musicians and 15airmen living there were evacuated before it exploded. Following the incident, an enquiry began and security at all RAF stations was reviewed. The following year, many RAF personnel from the station were deployed during the Falklands War. The station went on to celebrate its 70th anniversary in 1987 by staging several events that raised £30,000 for the RAF Benevolent Fund.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{work began}} on the rock on 7 August 1838. Stevenson and 21 workmen arrived on board the sailing vessel Pharos and began to unload the <b>barrack,</b> whose massive legs were set into holes blasted out of the rock. After only two days the site had to be {{abandoned}} as a storm swept in from the Atlantic. It was a further six days before they could resume the punishing schedule of 16 hours a day work between 4am and 8pm. Fearing sea sickness, many of the man preferred to attempt {{to sleep on the}} damp rocks than on the ever-rolling Pharos.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{needed a}} score to {{rehabilitate}} {{himself in the}} eyes of the Test Selectors and he spent all Saturday over 131runs while 20,000 impatient spectators <b>barracked</b> loudly. His dismissal on the third day evoked cheers all round the ground.|$|R
50|$|On May 9th, 51-year-old Tom Kent was {{executed}} by firing squad at the <b>Barrack's</b> Prison. His nerves {{were so bad}} {{on the morning of}} his execution that the guards had to bring a chair for him to sit upon.|$|R
25|$|While some of {{the other}} sports played and <b>barracked</b> for have grown in popularity, others have declined. For example, in {{basketball}} Tasmania has not been represented in the National Basketball League since the demise of the Hobart Devils in 1996.|$|R
5|$|Lord Clive, George's {{brother-in-law}} and heir, {{attempted to}} acquire the lease after 1803, citing the efforts that the family had put into restoring the castle. He faced competition for the lease from the government's <b>Barrack</b> Office, who were considering using the castle as a French prisoner-of-war camp for up to 4,000 inmates from the Napoleonic wars. After some extensive discussions the prisoner-of-war plan was finally dropped, and Lord Clive, by now declared the Earl of Powis, was offered the chance to buy the castle outright for £1,560, which he accepted in 1811.|$|E
5|$|Salem Chapel {{stands on}} land {{which had been}} part of the old Napoleonic <b>Barrack</b> Ground. Hence the name for the nearby Waterloo Road. The land was {{auctioned}} in 1839, and in the following year the purchaser, a Mr George Gould, himself a Baptist, sold two plots fronting the London Road for the erection of a Baptist Chapel. The land was purchased and fenced for the sum of £300 which was raised by way of a mortgage. The original meeting room, (now the Church Parlour) was built and opened in July 1840. The present chapel was completed and opened in 1847.|$|E
5|$|The Grade I listed Battle of Britain Bunker is now {{preserved}} as {{a museum}} open to the public, while the Grade II listed Hillingdon House will be partially converted into a restaurant.

St. Andrew's Gate will be retained, as will the Mons <b>barrack</b> block adjacent to the parade ground.|$|E
25|$|The crowd booed, <b>barracked</b> and slow-clapped but the Australians {{refused to}} try for a result. It was disappointing but, somehow, inevitable. Winning or losing the Ashes was even then such a huge event that no captain wanted to take {{unnecessary}} risks.|$|R
50|$|On 7 December, the {{regiment}} headed south under Sheridan in close pursuit of their enemy. By March, all the tribes had surrendered, and {{the regiment}} was then <b>barracked</b> at Fort Hays, where it remained until April 1869, {{when it was}} demobilized.|$|R
