40|$|Total mercury {{concentrations}} were {{measured in the}} muscle {{of different kinds of}} fish: megrim (Lepidor-hombus boscii), common sole (Solea vulgaris), striped mullet (Mullus barbatus), anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius), and <b>black-bellied</b> <b>angler</b> (Lophius budegassa), caught in the South Adriatic Sea (South Italy). The highest total mercury levels were found in anglerfish (0. 61 - 2. 22 mg/kg wet wt, mean 1. 26 +/- 0. 58), followed by <b>black-bellied</b> <b>angler</b> (0. 22 - 1. 62 mg/kg wet wt, 0. 68 +/- 0. 36), megrim (0. 05 - 0. 92 mg/kg wet wt, 0. 39 +/- 0. 30), striped mullet (0. 10 - 0. 63 mg/kg wet wt, 0. 31 +/- 0. 13) and common sole (0. 05 - 0. 44 mg/kg wet wt, 0. 19 +/- 0. 15). According to current regulations, 62. 5 % of anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) and 23 % of <b>black-bellied</b> <b>angler</b> (Lophius budegassa) samples showed concentrations exceeding the peak value of 1 mg/kg, while only 25 % of samples of megrim (Lepidorhombus boscii), and 8. 3 % of striped mullet (Mullus barbatus), exceeded the peak value fixed at 0. 5 mg/kg. Correlations between total mercury concentration and specimen weight were evident in all the species examined...|$|E
