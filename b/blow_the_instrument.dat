50|$|The flute is a {{transverse}} (or side-blown) woodwind {{instrument that}} is closed at <b>the</b> <b>blown</b> end. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> {{is played by}} blowing a stream of air over the embouchure hole.

50|$|Since, the apito de samba {{has a small}} ball or dowel rod {{that hits}} {{the sides of the}} whistle's chamber, this {{instrument}} creates a loud and shrill sound, which is useful in a samba school because the sound can be heard over the playing of the band.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{described}} how an immersive and interactive application {{is created by}} implementing physical models of a flute and a drum with the capability of changing dimensions in real-time.

A mallet is tracked using color tracking {{in order to measure}} when the mallet hits the virtual drum, and how hard. Virtual models of both instruments are also developed and implemented in 3 D stereo using Virtools [1]. The virtual flute is experienced as an extension of <b>the</b> physical <b>instrument</b> using a magnetic tracker system, which maps the movements of the user to the position and rotation of the virtual flute. The virtual drum is experienced as hovering in the air ready for the mallet to hit it. Both instruments are capable of changing size and shape to match the sound synthesis models. To further immerse the user, a visual feedback of the sound is produced. Lights and particles are altered in intensity and color to visualize changes in amplitude and frequency...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{highlight}} experimentally how inharmonicity of the bore resonance frequencies of an alto saxophone influence {{the nature of the}} oscillation regimes. A variable volume branching from the neck of an alto sax at an appropriate position allows to change the frequency of the first resonance independently from <b>the</b> second. A <b>blowing</b> machine with artificial lips is used to make the saxophone play while controlling independently the control parameters : <b>the</b> <b>blowing</b> pressure and an embouchure parameter. Values of these parameters are estimated experimentally through the measurement of the nonlinear characteristics linking the mean air flow <b>blown</b> into <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> to <b>the</b> static pressure difference across the reed. Experiments with different values of the control parameters {{as well as of the}} inharmonicity produce different kinds of oscillation regimes. These regimes are categorized through the analysis of the pressure signal inside the mouthpiece. The resulting maps demonstrate that the emergence of quasi-periodic regimes, and their extent, depend on the level of inharmonicity, but also on the values of the control parameters. Periodic regimes playable by choosing appropriate values of the control parameters also differ according to the level of inharmonicity, a higher inharmonicity facilitating the emergence of the third register...|$|R
5000|$|A nose whistle (also {{called a}} 'Noseflute') is a wind instrument, usually made in wood, but also {{available}} in plastic, clay and metal sheet, probably of South-American indigenous origin. In spite of its ethnic background, several models have been conceived and patented in the 19th and 20th Centuries. <b>The</b> nose <b>blows</b> air into <b>the</b> <b>instrument's</b> open nosepiece, from where it is channeled through an airduct, towards a rather sharp edge of a slit, positioned over the player's mouth opening. This edge helps creating a vortex that excites the acoustic field into the player's mouth cavity. Since the volume {{and shape of the}} mouth cavity can be widely and quickly controlled by the player, a wide range of playing frequencies are possible. This high playability of such sound <b>instrument</b> probably explains <b>the</b> fact that it is usually called [...] "Noseflute", rather than Nose Whistle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{recorders}} {{described by}} Virdung have cylindrical profiles with flat heads, narrow windows and long ramps, ring-like turnings on the feet, {{and a slight}} external flare at the bell (above, far left and middle left). Virdung depicts four recorders together: a [...] "baßcontra" [...] or [...] "bassus" [...] (basset) in F3 with an anchor shaped key and a perforated fontanelle, two tenors in C4 and a [...] "discantus" [...] (alto) in G4. According to Virdung, the configurations F-C-C-G or F-C-G-G {{should be used for}} four-part music, depending on the range of the bass part. As previously mentioned, the accuracy of these woodcuts cannot be verified as no recorders fitting this description survive. Virdung also provides the first ever fingering chart for a recorder with a range of an octave and a seventh, though he says that the bass had a range of only an octave and sixth. In his fingering chart, he numbers which fingers to lift rather than those to put down and, unlike in later charts, numbers them from bottom (1) to top (8). His only other technical instruction is that <b>the</b> player must <b>blow</b> into <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> and [...] "learn how to coordinate the articulations ... with the fingers." ...|$|R

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page, viewed on June 2, 2016 Thesis advisor: Chen YiVitaThesis (M. M.) [...] Conservatory of Music and Dance. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 Settings of the Sabbath {{is a piece}} written for large {{ensemble}} and SATB choir. The Sabbath is a sacred time for Jews that starts sundown Friday night and ends at sundown Saturday night. It {{is a time for}} reflection, prayer, and rest. Per Hebraic tradition, the prayers are usually sung monophonically which provides a unity among the congregation. These prayers are often unveiled in strophic form providing an easy method to remember the melodies and lyrics to the prayer. For more complicated prayers with multilayered meaning, however, the same melody cannot convey all of the different meanings. SATB choir and sinfonietta instrumentation add depth to the timbral and textural space available. The piece is in two movements. The first movement is based on the prayer "Lecha Dodi," which ushers in the Sabbath. It refers to “meeting the bride,” which in this case is Shabbat. The prayer is in many verses. I have chosen those that are most significant personally and that form the structure of the movement. The second movement is an interpretation of the "Sh’ma. " A prayer that says “Hear o Israel the Lord is our God the Lord is one. ” The word Sh’ma means “hear. ” This is an important word of the prayer. I conceptualized the word to unveil over 5 minutes. <b>The</b> <b>instruments</b> represent <b>the</b> sound of "sh" with air like noises on <b>the</b> trings and <b>blowing</b> through <b>the</b> <b>instruments.</b> <b>The</b> choir reveals the "mm" and then the "ah" part of the Sh’ma phonetically. The piece becomes more rhythmic and more chaotic harmonically and rhythmically. It culminates in a cacophony commanding the listener to “hear” this prayer.
