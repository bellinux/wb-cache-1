5|$|Elizabeth and Mary {{were soon}} sent to Novigrad Castle, with John of Palisna as their new jailer. Margaret insisted that Elizabeth <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> She was tried and, after the Christmas {{adjournment}} of the proceedings, {{found guilty of}} inciting Charles' murder. Sigismund marched into Slavonia in January 1387, with the intention to reach Novigrad and rescue the queens. Towards the middle of January, when news of Sigismund's approach reached Novigrad, Elizabeth was strangled by guards before Mary's eyes.|$|E
5|$|The {{change of}} {{government}} was welcome {{particularly to the}} senators, who had been harshly persecuted during Domitian's reign. As an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters, Nerva publicly swore that no senators would <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> {{as long as he}} remained in office. He called an end to trials based on treason, released those who had been imprisoned under these charges, and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled.|$|E
5|$|Phrynichus, {{fearing that}} Alcibiades if {{restored}} would avenge himself upon {{him for his}} opposition, sent a secret letter to the Spartan Admiral, Astyochus, {{to tell him that}} Alcibiades was ruining their cause by making Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians, and containing an express revelation {{of the rest of the}} intrigue. Astyochus went up to Alcibiades and Tissaphernes at Magnesia and communicated to them Phrynichus's letter. Alcibiades responded in kind, sending to the authorities at Samos a letter against Phrynichus, stating what he had done, and requiring that he should <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Phrynichus in desperation wrote again to Astyochus, offering him a chance to destroy the Athenian fleet at Samos. This also Astyochus revealed to Alcibiades who informed the officers at Samos that they had been betrayed by Phrynichus. Alcibiades however gained no credit, because Phrynichus had anticipated Alcibiades's letter and, before the accusations could arrive, told the army that he had received information of an enemy plan to attack the camp and that they should fortify Samos as quickly as possible.|$|E

5|$|She {{moved around}} several more camps, and survived {{the sinking of}} the {{transport}} ship SS Van Warwyck where in the aftermath she saved several passengers from drowning. Les Searle from the Grasshopper smuggled her once again into the next camp, where she was reunited with Frank Williams. After the end of the war, Judy's life was put in danger once again. She was about to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> by the Japanese guards following a lice outbreak amongst the prisoners. However, Williams hid the dog until the Allied forces arrived. Searle, Williams, and others smuggled Judy back to the UK aboard a troopship and she spent the next six months in quarantine after arriving. She was awarded the Dickin Medal by the PDSA, considered to be the animals' Victoria Cross. Judy died in 1950 in Tanzania from a tumour, after travelling with Williams there to work on a groundnut food scheme. Her Dickin Medal and collar were subsequently put on display at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford as part of 'The Animal's War' exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The newly {{appointed}} commander of this troubled fleet was Villaret de Joyeuse; although formerly in a junior position, {{he was known}} to possess a high degree of tactical ability; he had trained under Admiral Pierre André de Suffren in the Indian Ocean during the American war. However, Villaret's attempts to mould his new officer corps into an effective fighting unit were hampered by another new appointee, a deputy of the National Convention named Jean-Bon Saint-André. Saint-André's job was to report directly to the National Convention on the revolutionary ardour of both the fleet and its admiral. He frequently intervened in strategic planning and tactical operations. Shortly after his arrival, Saint-André proposed issuing a decree ordering that any officer deemed to have shown insufficient zeal in defending his ship in action should <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> on his return to France, although this highly controversial legislation {{does not appear to have}} ever been acted upon. Although his interference was a source of frustration for Villaret, Saint-André's dispatches to Paris were published regularly in Le Moniteur, and did much to popularise the Navy in France.|$|E
5|$|Under the Tang law code {{compiled}} in the 7th century, severe punishments were outlined {{for those}} who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system of elders. Those who assaulted their parents could <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> those who assaulted an older brother could be put to forced labor, and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to caning. A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state. Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just secular Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of ancestor worship transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures. Song society was also built on social relationships governed not by abstract principles, but on the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior.|$|E

5|$|In {{the temple}} with Nourabad, Leila expresses fear at being left alone, but Nourabad exhorts {{her to be}} brave and to fulfil her vows to Brahma on pain of her own death. She tells him of the courage she once {{displayed}} when, as a child, she had hidden a fugitive from his enemies and refused to give him up even when threatened with death (""). The fugitive had rewarded her with a necklace that he asked her always to wear. She had kept this promise, as she would her vows. On the priest's departure, Leila quietly muses on the former times when she and Nadir would meet together secretly (""). Nadir then enters; in her fear of Nourabad's threats Leila begs him to leave, but he remains and the two declare their love in a passionate duet (""). He goes, promising to return next night, but as he leaves he is captured by the fishermen and {{brought back to the}} temple. Zurga, as the fishermen's leader, at first resists the fishermen's calls for Nadir's execution and advocates mercy. However, after Nourabad removes Leila's veil, Zurga recognises her as his former love; consumed by jealousy and rage, he orders that both Nadir and Leila <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> A violent storm erupts, as the fishermen unite in singing a hymn to Brahma ("Brahma divin Brahma!").|$|E
