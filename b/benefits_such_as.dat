5|$|The poor {{conditions}} at the penitentiary were partially because the state leased management of the facility to private contractors, who frequently neglected prisoners' needs to cut costs. These contractors often provided <b>benefits</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> cheap laundry services and free meals to legislators to secure contracts {{and encourage them to}} ignore their abuse of prisoners. Blackburn called for the contract system to be replaced with a system of oversight by wardens employed by the state.|$|E
5|$|Trees provide <b>benefits</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{absorbing}} carbon dioxide, {{and other}} pollutants. Trees also provide shade and reduce ozone emissions from vehicles. By having many trees, we can cool the city heat by approximately 10 degrees to 20 degrees, {{which will help}} reducing ozone and helping communities that are mostly affected by the {{effects of climate change}} and urban heat islands.|$|E
5|$|Amanita gemmata is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of compatible host plants. Through the association, the plant provides the fungus with a carbon source, and the fungus provides the plant with several <b>benefits</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> nutrients and protection from pathogens. Largent and collaborators (1980) document mycorrhizal associations of A.gemmata with Manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) and Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta), and Nieto and Carbone with Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster) in Spain. The fungus favours sandy and slightly acidic soils, and is often found in association with Norway Spruce (Picea abies). The mushroom grows either singly, scattered, or in groups in coniferous and mixed forests, especially along paths and roads.|$|E

5|$|Being a {{low-cost}} airline, GoAir {{does not provide}} complimentary meals on its flights but offers options for buy on board in-flight meals. The airline publishes an in-flight magazine named Go-getter. GoAir offers a premium service known as Go Business at a higher fare which provides extra services including seats with greater legroom, free meals, increased baggage allowance and priority boarding. In 2011, the airline launched its frequent flyer programme called Go Club, which provided <b>benefits</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> lounge access and free upgrade to Go Business.

5|$|The Concert for Bangladesh– {{originally}} titled The Concert for Bangla Desh– is a live triple album by George Harrison {{and celebrity}} friends, released on Apple Records in December 1971 in America and January 1972 in Britain. The album followed the two concerts {{of the same}} name, held on 1 August 1971 at New York's Madison Square Garden, featuring Harrison, Bob Dylan, Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Leon Russell and Eric Clapton. The shows were a pioneering charity event, in aid of the homeless Bengali refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War, and set the model for future multi-artist rock <b>benefits</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Live Aid (1985) and the Concert for New York City (2001).|$|E
5|$|The women {{performed}} up to {{six hours}} a day, either singing their own florid repertoire from memory, sight-reading from partbooks, or participating in the balletti as singers and dancers. Thomasin LaMay posits that {{the women of the}} concerti delle donne provided sexual favors for members of the court, but there is no evidence for this, and the circumstances of their marriages and dowries argues against this interpretation. The women were paid salaries and received other <b>benefits,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> dowries and apartments in the ducal palace. Peverara received 300 scudi a year and lodging in the ducal palace for herself, her husband, and her mother - as well as a dowry of 10,000 scudi upon her marriage.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{evidence}} that cognitive deficits remain stable over time is reliable and abundant, {{much of the research}} in this domain focuses on methods to improve attention and working memory. Efforts to improve learning ability in individuals with schizophrenia using a high- versus low-reward condition and an instruction-absent or instruction-present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance, highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase cognitive performance. Training individuals with schizophrenia to alter their thinking, attention, and language behaviors by verbalizing tasks, engaging in cognitive rehearsal, giving self-instructions, giving coping statements to the self to handle failure, and providing self-reinforcement for success, significantly improves performance on recall tasks. This type of training, known as self-instructional (SI) training, produced <b>benefits</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> lower number of nonsense verbalizations and improved recall while distracted.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of {{the early years of}} the legacy. This bequest was {{administered}} by the Corporation of London in around 1460 and a small college was founded next to Guildhall Chapel, also using the library facilities in the chapel. Despite the fact that this continued for over 70 years, the earliest certain evidence of the existence of Carpenter's Children can only be traced back to 1536, and thus it isn't clear who these boys were, what they were taught and where they lived. In 1547, under the Chantries Act the Guildhall Chapel and Library were forfeited. The funding for the four boys was also discontinued. The Corporation of London remained in control of Carpenter's estate and accounts from the next 300 years show that the money continued to be spent on children's <b>benefits</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> providing new coats to every child or providing them with access to education.|$|E
5|$|The academy {{was formed}} as a not-for-profit company in 1999 and officially opened on 1 April 2000. It {{occupied}} converted naval premises until a clubhouse was built, which was opened in June 2005 by the Princess Royal. £7.85 million of funding for the project was donated by charities, individuals and local councils; the National Lottery donated £3 million in 2003, and the South West Regional Development Agency added £3.34 million. The academy's aims are to promote the sport of sailing {{at all levels of}} competence and ability, through courses, training and events, and to contribute to the economic regeneration of the area. Since opening it has created a demand in service and marine industries worth around £10 million. WPNSA continues to promote sailing to local schools, offering <b>benefits</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> free boat hoist and storage. Use of the facilities and access to training is open to anyone in return for an annual membership fee. On 6 July 2005, London was chosen to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the WPNSA was chosen to host the sailing events.|$|E

30|$|However, obtaining such a {{forecast}} {{has a number}} of issues. Firstly, how can we incentivise users to provide {{a forecast}} instead of just purchasing the resource on-demand?

5|$|The player's primary mode of {{transportation}} is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, customize the player's armor, travel to numerous planetary systems, and scan planets for mineral resources. These resources allow the player to research numerous in-game upgrades that {{are found in the}} missions, providing <b>benefits</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> increasing weapon damage, fortifying the player's health, or extending the ship's fuel capacity, among others. Scanning requires the player to move a reticle over a planet and launch a probe when an oscilloscope warns of near resources. Additional upgrades, equipment, and nonessential items such as magazines and decorations for the ship can be purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E
5|$|BioShock is a first-person shooter with {{role-playing}} game customization and stealth elements, and {{is similar}} to System Shock 2. The player takes the role of Jack as he is guided through Rapture towards various objectives. The player collects various weapons and plasmids as they work their way through enemy forces. The player can switch between one active weapon and one active plasmid at any time, allowing them to find combination attacks that can be effective against certain enemies, such as first shocking a Splicer then striking them down with a wrench. Weapons are limited by ammunition that the player collects; many weapons have secondary ammo types {{that can be used}} instead for additional <b>benefits,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> bullets that inflict fire damage. Plasmid use consumes a serum called EVE which can be restored using EVE syringes collected by the player. The player has a health meter that decreases when they take damage. The player can restore their health with medical packs found throughout Rapture. If the player's health reduces to zero, they will be regenerated at the last Vita-Chamber that they passed with limited amounts of health and EVE. A patch for the game allows players to disable these Vita-Chambers, requiring players to restart a saved game if the character dies.|$|E
5|$|Mad Maxs {{landscape}} {{consists of}} canyons, caves, deserts, and abandoned wastelands. The game's world {{is divided into}} several regions, with each having its own backstory and landscape. Unique landmarks and ruins can be discovered in each region. Side activities such as races, time trials, invading enemy fortresses, and eliminating enemy convoys {{can be found in}} each region. A region's threat level is lowered by completing these activities, facilitating its navigation. Each region has a boss, who can be found and defeated in their base. Some of the game's strongholds are friendly, and eliminating hostile strongholds gives Max additional quests and rewards. These strongholds can be upgraded, offering Max different <b>benefits</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> helping Max to collect scraps when the game is turned off, or restoring Max's health and shotgun ammo upon visits. Max can ascend in a hot-air balloon (permanently attached to the ground) to look for new objectives and locations. After seeing the objectives through binoculars, they are highlighted on the map. Max can be guided by Chumbucket in strategically completing his objectives. Max is accompanied by a dog companion called Dinki-Di, who can help players detect land mines. Max has limited climbing abilities, and objects that he can climb are highlighted in yellow.|$|E

5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered <b>benefits</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> greater productivity and the broad sharing of {{risk in the}} macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E

40|$|Immune {{intervention}} {{trials in}} {{type 1 diabetes}} have shown very mixed, and often surprising, results. Despite sug-gestions of benefit from GAD-Alum vac-cine in a phase 2 study (1), further studies, including two large phase 3 tri-als, showed no effect (2 – 4). Phase 3 trials with Anti-CD 3 monoclonal anti-bodies failed to achieve their primary outcome (5 – 7), despite very promising results from multiple phase 2 trials (8 – 13).
