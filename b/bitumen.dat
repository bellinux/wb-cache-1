40|$|Abstract This work {{focuses on}} the {{molecular}} structure evolution of asphaltite-modified paving <b>bitumens</b> during ageing. In order to quantify the effect of ageing on the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of <b>bitumens,</b> a new parameter, called hereafter the ageing molecular-distribution shift (AMDS), is introduced. The molecular evolutions of asphaltite-modified <b>bitumens</b> during aging are compared with the molecular evolutions of pure petroleum <b>bitumens</b> of equivalent grade. The results based on AMDS confirm previous research showing that the asphaltite attenuates the ageing and, compared to hard petroleum <b>bitumens</b> produced in refinery, the asphaltite-modified <b>bitumens</b> present a better ageing performance.

5|$|Oil sands in Alberta have {{a proven}} reserve of , {{the second largest}} proven {{reserves}} of crude oil in the world. They have become the largest source of oil imported into the United States. With significant economic development and investment into the oil sands, the industry has been enjoying strong support by both the province's government and the federal government. However, the industry has also been subject to criticism due to {{the environmental impacts of}} <b>bitumen</b> exploitation. While the industry has attempted to resolve these issues by developing new techniques, such as in situ extraction, environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace, have launched campaigns to delegitimize the resource, based on its greenhouse gas emission records.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bitumens</b> {{collected}} in the east zone of the Cigar Lake deposit have been analyzed by C- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance, pyrolysis - gas chromatography, Rock-Eval, and C. H, and 0 methods. Carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions and uranium contents have been determined. Results indicate that the <b>bitumens</b> consist mainly of aromatic structures (F(a) almost-equal-to 60 %) and have undergone a late oxidation process. Similarities in carbon isotopic composition (- 27. 5 part per thousand > deltaC- 13 > - 28. 2 parts per thousand) between barren <b>bitumens</b> (U < 300 ppm) and graphite {{collected in}} the basement gneisses, as well as evidence for progressive disorganization of graphite along a basement profile, suggest a genetic relationship between graphite and <b>bitumens</b> from the mineralized areas. The presence of amorphous carbon in pit structures inside graphite flakes close to the unconformity supports this assessment. Significant differences in geochemical and isotopic characteristics of the Cigar Lake barren <b>bitumens</b> and the Cluff Lake mineralized <b>bitumens</b> {{suggest that there are}} two possible mechanisms for their formation. Barren ''C-enriched <b>bitumens</b> could have formed directly by hydrogenation of amorphous carbon, whereas mineralized, isotopically light <b>bitumens</b> from Cluff Lake (deltaC- 13 almost-equal-to 48 parts per thousand) may result from the polymerization of light hydrocarbons around uraninite grains...|$|R

5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} along {{a series of}} roads between Appleton and Minneapolis around 1933. At first these roads were a mixture of gravel and <b>bitumen</b> surfaces, the latter a forerunner of today's asphalt. Within the first year or so, the western end was extended to terminate MN7 in the Ortonville area. In 1958, the highway was extended to its modern western terminus at Beardsley by replacing another trunk highway. The section that is now an expressway in the Twin Cities was expanded by the 1950s, and the whole highway was paved in a hard-surface {{by the end of}} that decade. The highway was truncated in the Twin Cities to its current eastern terminus in the 1980s. The scenic byways designations were applied at the state and federal levels in 1995 and 2002, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and corky materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of <b>bitumen,</b> telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|E

40|$|With {{the aid of}} a newly {{developed}} testing method, the flow behaviour of <b>bitumens</b> and polymer-modified <b>bitumens</b> was tested in tension retardation experiments with systematic variation of temperature and loading, and investigated for the purpose of ascertaining any connection with conventional viscosity features. The tension viscosities determined in tension retardation and relaxation experiments were tested for plausibility. It was also investigated whether the tension viscosity correlates with the shear viscosity determined by the Dekker method. The tension viscosity, which exhibits a high degree of temperature dependence, can be estimated for standard <b>bitumens,</b> but not however for polymer-modified <b>bitumens,</b> via the viscosity feature of ring and ball softening point and the penetration index. With the testing method developed, the flow behaviour of <b>bitumens</b> and polymer-modified <b>bitumens</b> in the service temperature range, in particular at low temperatures, can be determined with good precision, and assessed, via the physically interpretable material characteristic quantity of tension voscosity by means of tension retardation experiments.

25|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of moving crude <b>bitumen</b> through pipelines, non-upgraded <b>bitumen</b> is usually diluted with natural-gas condensate in a form called dilbit or with synthetic crude oil, called synbit. However, to meet international competition, much non-upgraded <b>bitumen</b> is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of <b>bitumen,</b> conventional crude oil, synthetic crude oil, and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as Western Canadian Select. This sour, heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as Mexican Mayan or Arabian Dubai Crude.|$|E
25|$|After excavation, {{hot water}} and caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) {{is added to the}} sand, and the {{resulting}} slurry is piped to the extraction plant where it is agitated and the oil skimmed from the top.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of elemental sulphur and sulphur bound in inorganic and organic compounds was investigated for three surface {{samples of the}} oil-source rock from the Upper Jurassic strata in the Dinarides.

25|$|Albanian <b>bitumen</b> {{extraction}} has a {{long history}} and was practiced in an organized way by the Romans.

25|$|<b>Bitumen</b> was the nemesis of {{many artists}} during the 19th century. Although widely {{used for a}} time, it {{ultimately}} proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, <b>bitumen</b> never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of <b>bitumen</b> as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of Delacroix. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of <b>bitumen</b> is ThÃ©odore GÃ©ricault's Raft of the Medusa (1818â1819), where his use of <b>bitumen</b> caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bitumen</b> {{was used}} in early {{photographic}} technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist Joseph NicÃ©phore NiÃ©pce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature. The <b>bitumen</b> was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the <b>bitumen</b> and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making <b>bitumen</b> impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist {{in the production of}} printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.|$|E
