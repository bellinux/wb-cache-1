25|$|Most of {{northern}} Mexico suffers {{from one of}} the world’s highest rates of desertification due to land degradation in arid and semi arid areas, with the loss of biological and/or economic productivity, but the process is most severe Sonora as neighboring Sinaloa. Land degradation occurs because of clearing land for agriculture, the planting of non-native buffelgrass for grazing, the cutting of forests, overgrazing of natural vegetation and soil salinization from irrigation. A study by <b>Balling</b> in 1998 showed higher soil and air temperatures in areas that have been overgrazed, deforested and otherwised cleared land, likely {{due to the lack of}} shading vegetation, which leads to higher soil evaporation and desert conditions.

500|$|The {{types of}} fish seen in Abzû {{were based on}} real-life creatures from the oceans of Earth, and to fit them into the game each species was {{distilled}} down to its most distinctive traits. The team had [...] "tens of thousands" [...] of fish within the game. Their swimming styles were directly modeled on the behavior and physics of real fish movements. The number of fish presented problems with running the game, but the programming staff developed a method of simplifying each fish's animation without compromising the game's visuals, which [...] "multiplied the number of fish possible on screens by 10". Each fish species had its own unique artificial intelligence that had cascading levels of awareness and interaction with other species and objects in the environment. The team started with getting the fish to swim without clipping through walls, then built upon that with further expansion on fish behavior and interaction. Their most challenging task was creating realistic bait <b>balling</b> effects for shoals of small fish, which was only achieved and finalized {{near the end of}} development. The developers did take liberties by grouping together types of fish from different parts of the globe which would normally not be able to interact, though this fell in line with the game's overall theme and the myths it referenced. Despite this, the developers emulated the zones that each fish would be found in, whether it be a coral reef or the deep ocean where sunlight does not reach. The amount of work and the team's dedication to creating a realistic and vibrant experience meant they were creating fish until development finished.|$|E

Although these DLBCLs include {{significant numbers of}} tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and interdigitating dendritic cells, <b>BAL</b> 1 and BBAP were expressed primarily by malignant B cells, prompting speculation that the genes might be induced by host-derived inflammatory mediators such as gamma interferon (IFN-γ).

40|$|We {{investigate}} C IV broad {{absorption line}} (<b>BAL)</b> variability within {{a sample of}} 46 radio-loud quasars (RLQs), selected from SDSS/FIRST data to include both core-dominated (39) and lobe-dominated (7) objects. The sample consists primarily of high-ionization <b>BAL</b> quasars, and a substantial fraction have large <b>BAL</b> velocities or equivalent widths; their radio luminosities and radio-loudness values span ~ 2. 5 orders of magnitude. We have obtained 34 new Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) spectra of 28 <b>BAL</b> RLQs to compare to earlier SDSS data, and we also incorporate archival coverage (primarily dual-epoch SDSS) for a total set of 78 pairs of equivalent width measurements for 46 <b>BAL</b> RLQs, probing rest-frame timescales of ~ 80 - 6000 d (median 500 d). In general, only modest changes {{in the depths of}} segments of absorption troughs are observed, akin to those seen in prior studies of <b>BAL</b> RQQs. Also similar to previous findings for RQQs, the RLQs studied here are more likely to display <b>BAL</b> variability on longer rest-frame timescales. However, typical values of |Delta_EW| and |Delta_EW|/ are about 40 +/- 20 % lower for <b>BAL</b> RLQs when compared with those of a timescale-matched sample of <b>BAL</b> RQQs. Optical continuum variability is of similar amplitude in <b>BAL</b> RLQs and <b>BAL</b> RQQs; for both RLQs and RQQs, continuum variability tends to be stronger on longer timescales. <b>BAL</b> variability in RLQs does not obviously depend upon their radio luminosities or radio-loudness values, but we do find tentative evidence for greater fractional <b>BAL</b> variability within lobe-dominated RLQs. Enhanced <b>BAL</b> variability within more edge-on (lobe-dominated) RLQs supports some geometrical dependence to the outflow structure.

We conducted a Chandra snapshot survey of 12 bright <b>BAL</b> RLQs selected from SDSS/FIRST data and possessing a wide range of radio and C IV absorption properties. Optical spectra were obtained nearly contemporaneously with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope; no strong flux or <b>BAL</b> variability was seen between epochs. In addition to the snapshot targets, we include in our sample 9 additional <b>BAL</b> RLQs possessing archival Chandra coverage. We compare the properties of (predominantly high-ionization) <b>BAL</b> RLQs to those of non-BAL RLQs as well as to <b>BAL</b> radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) and non-BAL RQQs for context. All 12 snapshot and 8 / 9 archival <b>BAL</b> RLQs are detected, with observed X-ray luminosities less than those of non-BAL RLQs having comparable optical/UV luminosities by typical factors of 4. 1 – 8. 5. (<b>BAL</b> RLQs are also X-ray weak by typical factors of 2. 0 – 4. 5 relative to non-BAL RLQs having both comparable optical/UV and radio luminosities.) However, <b>BAL</b> RLQs are not as X-ray weak relative to non-BAL RLQs as are <b>BAL</b> RQQs relative to non-BAL RQQs.
