40|$|In {{this and}} the next lecture, {{we are going to}} {{consider}} approaches to clustering the vertices of a graph. I think that we understand reasonably well how to partition the vertices of a graph into two sets. However, in clustering, we want to divide the vertices of a graph into many sets. This problem is not nearly as well understood. There is quite a bit of disagreement over what one should be optimizing. Even once one has a measure of the quality of a clustering, it is usually computationally difficult to find a clustering that optimizes this measure. So, one typically uses a heuristic. The best heuristics typically combine two operations: a global optimization followed by local improvements. This lecture will probably just focus on the global optimizations, unless I have time time to implement some local improvement algorithms. Thealgorithms that workbestdependquiteabitontheareaofapplication. TheScientificComputing community has developed a number of algorithms for partitioning well-shaped meshes (Chaco, Metis and Scotch). Different, but related, algorithms have proved popular in Image Segmentation (Shi and Malik, Yu and Shi). A very different type of algorithm is popular with Phyisicists who now study social networks. We will see this type of algorithm next lecture. For now, let me recommend the survey of von Luxburg [Lux 07]. 19. 2 K-Means <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> too <b>into</b> how one shouldcluster the vertices of a graph, lets take a moment to consider the seemingly easier problem of clustering vectors in IR d.
