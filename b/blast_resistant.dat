Constructed on a two city block site, one block north and west of the former site, the new building's design maximized sustainable design and workplace productivity initiatives. Security design was paramount to the Federal employees and its neighbors. Secure design was achieved based on the GSA's current standards for secure facilities including <b>blast</b> <b>resistant</b> glazing. Structural design resists progressive collapse. Building mass, glazing inside the courtyard, and bollards help to maintain a sense of openness and security.

30|$|Comparing with three-line rice hybrid {{production}} system, two-line {{system with}} TGMS has some advantages: (1) The male sterility were controlled by recessive nuclear genes. Any genotype with good combining ability {{can be used}} as a male parent. The frequency of obtaining heterotic hybrids in testcrosses is relatively higher than three-line system. (2) It can be used to develop hybrids of japonica or basmati in which there are very low frequency of cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) restorers. (3) It is especially suited for developing sub specific hybrid (indica/japonica) because there is no restriction of restoring-maintaining relationship in TGMS system. (4) The cost for hybrid seed production is lower as compared to the three-line system. Two-line hybrid breeding has been widely used in China as an effective approach to the improvement of rice grain yield and quality.

In this study, we show that this CD 8 + T cell subset can also undergo extensive proliferation in mixed lymphocyte cultures in response to allogeneic cells. Analysis of their cytolytic activity revealed a broad specificity against a panel of allogeneic phytohemagglutinin-induced blasts derived from HLA-unmatched donors. On the other hand, autologous and certain allogeneic phytohemagglutinin <b>blasts</b> were <b>resistant</b> to lysis. We used as target cells the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) - 2 −/− murine RMA-S cell line cotransfected with β 2 -microglobulin and HLA-E* 01033. On loading these cells with different HLA-E-binding peptides derived either from HLA class I leader sequences or viral proteins, we could show that HLA-E-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes recognized many, but not all, peptides analyzed. These data suggest that these cells may recognize, on allogeneic cells, HLA-E with peptides that are not present in the host of origin. In addition to their ability to proliferate in response to allogeneic stimulation and to lyse, most allogeneic cells may have important implications in transplantation and in antitumor immune responses...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The tumor {{necrosis}} factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) {{is regarded}} as a potential anticancer agent. However, many cancer cells are resistant to apoptosis induction by TRAIL. The present study was designed to evaluate the sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in acute myeloblastic leukemias (AML). DESIGN AND METHODS: TRAIL/TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R) expression and sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis were explored in 79 AML patients, including 17 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). RESULTS: In non-APL AML we observed frequent expression of TRAIL decoy receptors (TRAIL-R 3 and TRAIL-R 4), while TRAIL-R 1 and TRAIL-R 2 expression was restricted to AML exhibiting monocytic features. Total leukemic blasts, as well as AML colony-forming units (AML-CFU), were invariably resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. APL express membrane-bound TRAIL on their surface and exhibit a pattern of TRAIL-R expression similar to that observed in the other types of AML. Before, during and after retinoic acid treatment APL cells are TRAIL-resistant. The induction of granulocytic maturation of APL cells by retinoic acid was associated with a marked decline of TRAIL expression. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of experimental APL models (i. e., U 937 cells engineered to express PML/RAR-Eo and NB 4 cells) provided evidence that PML/RAR-Eo expression was associated with downmodulation of TRAIL-R 1 and with resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. We suggest that AML blasts, including APL <b>blasts,</b> are <b>resistant</b> to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, a phenomenon seemingly related to the expression of TRAIL decoy receptors on these cells. Finally, APL blasts express membrane-bound TRAIL that could confer an immunologic privilege to these cells...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of major}} {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) class I expression {{in control of the}} sensitivity of normal cells to natural killer (NK) cells was studied by the use of mutant mice made deficient for expression of beta 2 -microglobulin (beta 2 m) through homologous recombination in embryonal stem cells. T-cell blasts from beta 2 m-deficient (beta 2 m -/-) mice were killed by NK cells from normal mice in vitro, while beta 2 m +/- <b>blasts</b> were <b>resistant.</b> The beta 2 m defect also affected the NK effector cell repertoire: NK cells from beta 2 m -/- mice failed to kill beta 2 m -/- blasts, while they retained the ability to kill the prototype NK cell target lymphoma YAC- 1, although at reduced levels. The inability to recognize beta 2 m -/- blasts could be transferred with beta 2 m -/- bone marrow to irradiated beta 2 m-expressing mice. In contrast, the development of CD 8 + T cells (deficient in beta 2 m -/- mice) was restored in such chimera. These results indicate that loss of MHC class I/beta 2 m expression is sufficient to render normal cells sensitive to NK cells, and that the same defect in the hemopoietic system of a mouse renders its NK cells tolerant to beta 2 m-deficient but otherwise normal cells. In the beta 2 m -/- mice, NK cells may be selected or educated by other bone marrow cells to tolerate the MHC class I deficiency. Alternatively, the specificity may be controlled directly by the class I molecules on the NK cells themselves...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: There {{is a need}} {{to better}} {{understand}} the rate dependence behavior of reinforced concrete structures in order to improve their response to impact and blast loads. Analysis and design of reinforced concrete structures subjected to seismic loadings has been recommended in many FEMA guidelines. However, reevaluation of design becomes extremely important in cases where large deformations are expected such as <b>blast</b> and impact <b>resistant.</b> Approach: This study presents a numerical model to evaluate reinforced concrete columns submitted to high strain rates expected for seismic, impact and blast loadings. The model utilizes dynamic stress-strain response and considers the effect of strain rate on concrete strength; strain at peak stress; yield and ultimate strength of steel; and slope of the softening portion of the stress-strain curve. Results: Results are presented in the form of interaction diagrams and compared with the available analytical and experimental results. Comparison with available data shows that the proposed model can give consistent prediction of the dynamic behavior of reinforced concrete columns. Conclusion/Recommendations: The established interaction diagrams may be used to design columns to withstand high velocity impact loads.

40|$|The {{survival}} of most patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) remains poor, and novel therapeutic approaches {{are needed to}} improve outcomes. Given that the fraction of AML with mutated p 53 is small (∼ 10 %), it appears rational to study MDM 2 inhibitors as therapy for AML. Here, we report results of a detailed characterization of sensitivity and resistance to treatment ex vivo with the MDM 2 inhibitor MI 219 in AML blasts from 109 patients. In line with previous observations, all AML cases with mutated p 53 were resistant to MI 219. Importantly, approximately 30 % of AML cases with unmutated p 53 also demonstrated primary resistance to MI 219. Analysis of potential mechanisms associated with MI 219 resistance in AML blasts with wild-type p 53 uncovered distinct molecular defects, including low or absent p 53 protein induction after MDM 2 inhibitor treatment or external irradiation. Furthermore, a separate subset of <b>resistant</b> <b>blasts</b> displayed robust p 53 protein induction after MI 219 treatment, indicative of defective p 53 protein function or defects in the apoptotic p 53 network.

40|$|International audienceGiven their {{recognized}} {{ability to}} kill {{acute myeloid leukemia}} (AML) blasts both in vitro and in vivo, Vγ 9 Vδ 2 T cells are of growing interest {{in the design of}} new strategies of immunotherapy. We show that the Butyrophilin 3 A (BTN 3 A, CD 277) subfamily is a critical determinant of Vγ 9 Vδ 2 TCR-mediated recognition of human primary AML blasts ex vivo. Moreover, anti-BTN 3 A 20. 1 agonist monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can trigger BTN 3 A on AML blasts leading to further enhanced Vγ 9 Vδ 2 T cell-mediated killing, but this mAb had no enhancing effect upon NK cell-mediated killing. We show that monocytic differentiation of primary AML blasts accounts for their AminoBisphosphonate (N-BP) -mediated sensitization to Vγ 9 Vδ 2 T cells. In addition, anti-BTN 3 A 20. 1 mAbs could specifically sensitize <b>resistant</b> <b>blasts</b> to Vγ 9 Vδ 2 T cells lysis and overcome the poor effect of N-BP treatment on those blasts.

However, {{the importance of}} increased DNA repair in resistant cells is becoming more apparent. In order to investigate {{the ability of the}} DNA repair inhibitor aphidicolin to modulate drug resistance, we continually exposed blasts cells, isolated from 22 patients with AML, to a variety of agents ± 15  μM aphidicolin for 48 hours. Cell survival was measured using the MTT assay. Overall, there was no significant effect of aphidicolin on sensitivity to daunorubicin, doxorubicin, etoposide or fludarabine. However, there was a marked increase in sensitivity to ara-C with a median 4. 75 -fold increase overall (range 0. 8 – 80 -fold;P< 0. 005). The effect of aphidicolin was significantly greater in <b>blast</b> cells found <b>resistant</b> in vitro to ara-C (8. 9 -fold compared to 2. 12 -fold, P< 0. 01). This observation was further validated by the correlation between ara-C LC 50 and extent of modulation effect (P< 0. 05). Cells isolated from 10 cord blood samples were also tested in order to establish the haematological toxicity of combining ara-C and aphidicolin. The therapeutic index (LC 50 normal cells/tumour cells) for ara-C + aphidicolin was higher than that for ara-C alone suggesting no increased myelotoxicity for the combination. Increased cytotoxicity without increased haematotoxicity makes the combination of ara-C plus aphidicolin ideal for inclusion in future clinical trials. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [URL]...|$|R
