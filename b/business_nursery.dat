Advertising by nursery companies exhibiting at industry trade shows is becoming increasingly important for companies wishing to establish their presence in the industry. In the United States, nurserymen spend an average of 4 % of annual gross sales on advertising (Brooker and Witte, 1997), with a sizable portion of that budget allocated to advertising at industry trade shows. As noted by Daniel (1996), trade show marketing requires strategic planning which is “more than just showing up and working a booth ” (p. 27). Trade show marketing is important due to its direct and indirect sales effects. Potential customers and casual visitors tour the booths of their choice and become familiarized with company products. These visits can impact on companies ’ sales (Kotabe and Helsen, 1998).

40|$|Starting a plant nursery {{is an idea}} {{many people}} who like to grow plants {{consider}} at one time or another.

40|$|Despite {{conforming}} to the juridical and institutional {{standards of the}} European Union and a supportive policy {{on the part of}} the country's government, the SME sector in Hungary still has many distinctive features compared with its equivalent in the West. The intermediary institutions recently established are not yet working effectively. The networks of information and co-operation between businesses are poorly developed. In the sphere of innovation, owing to their meagre financial resources and given the lack of genuine <b>business</b> <b>nurseries,</b> the SMEs are at a disadvantage in relation to large-scale enterprises. This analysis brings out the fact that the Central Region is markedly ahead of the rest of the country. Nevertheless, when an international comparison is made, this region does not yet rank among the developed zones of Europe. The investigation shows that the SMEs are not greatly interested in the training programmes that are available. A new strategy for training is needed. ...|$|R
