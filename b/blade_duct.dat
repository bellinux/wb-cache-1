At this time, the turbulent flow of flow field in the <b>blade</b> <b>duct</b> {{will be in a}} strong non-equilibrium state, and thus the <b>blade</b> <b>duct</b> vortexes will be generated. To further study the mechanism of <b>blade</b> <b>duct</b> vortexes and to control the generation of these vortexes, Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model was used to numerically simulate and calculate the internal flow in the low specific speed turbine runner under low load conditions. The <b>blade</b> <b>duct</b> vortexes in the turbine runner were accurately predicted. The effect of short blade in eliminating and reducing the vortexes in the low specific speed turbine runner was analyzed and compared. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to carry out systematic experimental investigations of turbine blades with film cooling ejection, while CO_ 2 is used as cooling fluid. Thus, one simulates density conditions similar to those given in real gas turbines by the density ratio of hot gas in the <b>blade</b> <b>duct</b> to the cooling fluid. Detailed measurements are carried out in a plane transonic cascade wind tunnel to obtain improved knowledge of the influence on airfoil boundary layers and of shock-boundary layer interaction phenomena. The tests are carried out for {{a large number of}} parameter variations, such as the Mach number, ejection configurations, and ejection rate. Owing to the density difference between the main flow air and CO_ 2 and using the schlieren measurement technique, it is possible to visualize the CO_ 2 jets and their mixing with the main flow.

40|$|The {{centrifugal}} turbine architecture {{represents a}} promising solution for Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) Systems, in the smallto- medium power range. The large volumetric expansion ratios occurring in ORC turbines complicate {{the design of}} the turboexpander, making the centrifugal arrangement worth of interest with respect to conventional architectures. A new-concept centrifugal turbine has been recently proposed by the authors, based on the design of Ljungstr¨om but implementing a stator-rotor arrangement, which allows for multi-stage assembly without compromising compactness. To properly evaluate the potential of the centrifugal turbine solution, reliable data on cascade aerodynamic performances are required, but they are still lacking in the open literature. In this paper the aerodynamics of radial-outward turbine cascades is discussed, on the basis of Computational Fluid-Dynamics (CFD) simulations. A weakly transonic operating condition is selected and for that different classes of profiles are tested. Results show that the intrinsic diverging shape of the radialoutward configuration complicates the blade design; if the flow deflection is not properly controlled along the streamwise direction, the <b>bladed</b> <b>duct</b> can result in a converging-diverging channel, leading to unexpected chocked flows and shocks even in weakly transonic configurations. The indications achieved by the comparison between different blade profiles are gathered to define guidelines for the design of novel elliptic profiles, which allow to control the flow acceleration process, providing high aerodynamic efficiency. Off-design performances of the elliptic profiles are finally addressed by studying the response of the cascade to different expansion ratios and high incidence angles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A new {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} structural life consumption due to resonant fatigue in turbine blades, or vanes, is presented and explained. A rotating blade or vane in a gas turbine can change its contour due to erosion and/or material build up, {{in any of}} these instances, the surface pressure distribution occurring on the suction and pressure sides of blades-vanes can suffer substantial modification of their pressure and temperatures envelopes and flow characteristics. Meanwhile, the relative rotation between the <b>blade</b> and <b>duct</b> vane while the pressurized gas flows and the consequent wake crossings, will induce a fluctuating thrust force or lift that will excite the blade. An actual totally used up set of vane-blade components in a HP turbine power stage in a gas turbine is analyzed. The blade suffered some material erosion mostly at the trailing edge provoking a peculiar surface pressure envelope which evolved as the relative position between the vane and the blade passed in front of each other. Interestingly preliminary modal analysis for this eroded blade indicates several natural frequencies within the aeromechanic power spectrum, moreover, the highest frequency component is 94 % of one natural frequency indicating near resonant condition.

40|$|Results from a {{numerical}} simulation of the unsteady flow through {{one quarter of}} the circumference of a transonic high-pressure turbine stage, transition duct, and low-pressure turbine first vane are presented and compared with experimental data. Analysis of the unsteady pressure field resulting from the simulation shows the effects of not only the rotor/stator interaction of the high-pressure turbine stage but also new details of the interaction between the blade and the downstream transition duct and low-pressure turbine vane. Blade trailing edge shocks propagate downstream, strike, and reflect off of the transition duct hub and/or downstream vane leading to high unsteady pressure on these downstreamcomponents. The reflection of these shocks from the downstream components back into the blade itself has also been found to increase the level of unsteady pressure fluctuations on the uncovered portion of the blade suction surface. In addition, the blade tip vortex has been found to have a moderately strong interaction with the downstream vane even with the considerable axial spacing between the two blade-rows. Fourier decomposition of the unsteady surface pressure of the blade and downstream low-pressure turbine vane shows the magnitude of the various frequencies contributing to the unsteady loads. Detailed comparisons between the computed unsteady surface pressure spectrum and the experimental data are shown along with a discussion of the various interaction mechanisms between the <b>blade,</b> transition <b>duct,</b> and downstream vane.

40|$|The work {{performed}} to develop composite load spectra (CLS) for the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) using probabilistic methods. The three methods were implemented {{to be the}} engine system influence model. RASCAL was chosen to be the principal method as most component load models were implemented with the method. Validation of RASCAL was performed. High accuracy comparable to the Monte Carlo method can be obtained if a large enough bin size is used. Generic probabilistic models were developed and implemented for load calculations using the probabilistic methods discussed above. Each engine mission, either a real fighter or a test, has three mission phases: the engine start transient phase, the steady state phase, and the engine cut off transient phase. Power level and engine operating inlet conditions change during a mission. The load calculation module provides the steady-state and quasi-steady state calculation procedures with duty-cycle-data option. The quasi-steady state procedure is for engine transient phase calculations. In addition, a few generic probabilistic load models were also developed for specific conditions.

These generic probabilistic load models provide sufficient latitude for simulating loads with specific conditions.

This is in contrast to several linear and nonlinear RANS models, which display turbulence model sensitivity. For LES, the influence of inlet turbulence is also tested and has a minor impact due to the strong turbulence generated by the ribs. Large scale turbulent motions destroy any classical boundary layer reducing near wall grid requirements. The wake-type flow structure makes this and similar flows nearly Reynolds number independent, allowing a range of flows to be studied at similar cost. Hence LES is a relatively cheap method for obtaining accurate heat transfer predictions in these types of flows. This is the accepted manuscript. The final version is available at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|We have {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} influence of the tip clearance between a flat-plate-type <b>blade</b> and a <b>duct</b> surface on the flow characteristics around a single rotating blade. The setting angle of the blade was limited within the range where the leading edge separation did not occur over the whole blade span. The local attack angle of the main flow to the blade became smaller toward the tip; the leading edge separation, however, began near the blade tip. The separated zone gradually extended toward the boss of the rotor as the blade setting angle became larger. This {{is due to the fact}} that the low-energy fluid in the dead flow region of the wake of the blade is accumulated near the blade tip and it causes the leading edge separation there. A typical periodic fluctuation of the wake flow due to Karman vortex shedding from the trailing edge of the blade was observed in the intermediate region of the blade at any time if the reattached main flow did not separate up to the trailing edge on the suction surface of the blade...|$|R

These materials can withstand high temperatures and have good processing properties, which make them particularly useful for jet and rocket engines and for components such as fan <b>blades,</b> bushings, and <b>duct</b> segments.

A typical polyimide composite {{is made up of}} layers of carbon or glass fibers glued together by a high-temperature polymer to make the material strong, stiff, and lightweight. Organic molecules containing carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen within the polyimide keep the material s density low, resulting in the light weight.

The strength of the carbon fibers coupled with the stiffness of polyimides allows engineers to make a very rigid structure without it being massive.

The present work consists of velocity measurements at different locations {{in a test}} section with a 180 ◦ bend with ribs on one wall. Three geometric rib parameters are considered; rib-rib spacing, rib orientation angle and rib blockage ratio. PIV is used for flow visualization and analysis. Along with the clean duct measurements, ribs with blockage ratios, b/h, of 0. 25 and 0. 125 were considered. The b/h = 0. 25 cases have been comprehensively analyzed while the b/h = 0. 125 cases have been studied at the post-bend region of the duct only. Reynolds number considered is {{in the range of}} approximately 5000 - 40, 000 and the rotation speed is varied for a rotation number from 0 to 7. It is observed that rotation has a significant effect on secondary flows within the rotating duct. For blockage ratio, b/h = 0. 25, at a constant Re and Ro, the RMS of fluctuations of velocity do not show large spatial variations with ribs or rib orientations. At higher Re, the value decreases in comparison to the low Re cases. The kinetic energy of fluctuations increases due to the presence of ribs, indicating better heat transfer for the ribbed duct, but do not show large variations with rib orientation angle. The fluctuations and kinetic energy show maximum values at the post-bend regions of the duct. The velocity fields and PDFs show a possible cause for efficient heat transfer for the 45 ◦ rib arrangement as compared with the 90 ◦ rib cases. At high Ro, the absolute value of circulation has a large increase at the post-bend and thereafter there is a gradual decay at the exit for all cases. The ribs with blockage ratio of b/h = 0. 125 showed no marked changes in circulation with changes in rib orientation angle, thus implying that the rib blockage plays a role in the generation of secondary flows, particularly in conjunction with rotation...|$|R
40|$|Tilting ducted fans {{present a}} {{solution}} for the lifting and forward flight propulsion requirements of VTOL aircraft. However, the geometry of the duct enshrouding the propeller has great a effect on {{the efficiency of the}} fan in various flight modes. Shroud geometry controls the velocity and pressure at the face of the fan, while maintaining a finite loading out at the tips of the fan <b>blades.</b> A <b>duct</b> tailored for most efficient generation of static lifting thrust will generally suffer from performance deficiencies in forward flight. The converse is true as well, leaving the designer with a difficult trade affecting the overall performance and sizing of the aircraft. Ideally, the shroud of a vertical lifting fan features a generous bell mouth inlet promoting acceleration of flow into the face of the fan, and terminating in a converging nozzle at the exit. Flow entering the inlet is accelerated into the fan by the circulation about the shroud, resulting in an overall increase in thrust compared to an open propeller operating under the same conditions. The accelerating shroud design is often employed in lifting ducted fans to benefit from the thrust augmentation; however, such shroud designs produce significant drag penalties in axial flight, thus are unsuitable for efficient forward flight applications. Decelerating, or diffusing, duct designs are employed for higher speed forward flight configurations. The lower circulation on the shroud tends to decelerate the flow into the face of the fan, which is detrimental to static thrust development; however, net thrust is developed on the shroud while the benefits of finite blade loading are retained. With judicious shroud design for intended flight speeds, a net increase in efficiency can be obtained over an open propeller. In this experiment, conducted under contract to NASA LaRC (contract NAG- 1 - 02093) circulation control is being applied to a mildly diffusing shroud design, intended for improved forward flight performance, to generate circulation in the sense of an accelerating duct design. The intent is to improve static thrust performance of a ducted fan tailored for high speed axial flight, {{while at the same time}} significantly reduce the pressure signature on the ground plane.

It is recognized that the present method of setting the source line distribution representing blade thickness (currently based on linearized slender-body theory for an isolated foil section) may introduce significant errors. This {{is the case for}} propulsors with a combination of a large thickness/chord ratio (blockage effect) and numerous blades (cascade effect). A source panel (area) method was developed to more accurately model these effects. This method uses the lattice structure of the current PBD- 14 code from which to compute the source-induced velocity factors between the <b>blades,</b> hub, and <b>duct,</b> if present. Using the method of images allows the hub and duct to be modeled as panel images from the blade panels. The source-induced effects of the whole propulsor are accounted for by using a panel method to obtain a source distribution along the mean camber surface of the blade. Invoking the kinematic boundary condition on the true blade suction and pressure surfaces solves this system of linear equations, which represent the blade thickness distribution. This robust formulation assigns source strengths more accurately over a much larger range of thickness/chord ratios and increasing numbers of blades, as evidenced by a more accurate velocity streamline trace representation of the actual pressure and suction side surfaces of the blade. Experimental validation is demonstrated for open and ducted flow stators. CIVIN...|$|R
40|$|CIVINSThis thesis {{develops}} {{a method to}} analyze the maneuvering forces on surfaced and underwater vehicles with complex propulsors. The analysis method is developed for general propellers yet has unique applicability to model highly contracting stern flows associated with integrated propulsors. Integrated propulsors exhibit strong coupling of the various <b>blade</b> rows and <b>duct,</b> if present, to the vehicle stern. The method developed herein provides a robust means to analyze propulsor induced maneuvering forces including those arising from wake adapted, multi-stage, ducted propulsors. The heart of the maneuvering force prediction is a three-dimensional, unsteady lifting surface method developed as {{the first part of}} this thesis. The new method is designated PUF- 14 for Propeller Unsteady Forces. The lifting surface method uses many advanced techniques. One significant advance is the use of a wake adapted lattice to model the flow through the propulsor. In related research, a 2 -D Kutta condition has been augmented using Lagrangian interpolation to dramatically reduce the required computational time to model a 2 -D gust. The second thrust of this thesis couples the unsteady lifting surface method with a three-dimensional, time-average Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes flow solver. Rotating a propeller through a spatially varying flow field causes temporally varying forces on the propeller. From the converged coupled solution, the maneuvering and blade rate forces can be estimated. This thesis explores the relationship of time varying and time average forces in the flow solver and potential flow domains. Similarly, it explores the relationship of the effective inflow in the two domains. Finally, this thesis details the synergistic means to correctly couple the potential flow method to a viscous solver. Verification and validation of the method have been done on a variety of geometries and vehicles. Preliminary results show good correlation with experiment[URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{tendency in}} modern aeroengine gas turbines towards reduction of <b>blade</b> count and <b>ducts</b> length {{may lead to}} aerodynamic loading increase beyond the limit of boundary layer separation. For this reason boundary layer separation control methods, up to now mostly employed in external aerodynamics, begin to be experimented in internal flows applications. The present paper reports {{the results of a}} detailed experimental study on low profile vortex generators used to control boundary layer separation on a large-scale flat plate with prescribed adverse pressure gradients. Inlet turbulent boundary layer conditions and pressure gradients are representative of aggressive turbine intermediate ducts. This activity is part of a joint European research program on Aggressive Intermediate Duct Aerodynamics (AIDA). The pressure gradients on the flat plate are generated by increasing the aperture angle of a movable wall opposite to the flat plate. To avoid separation on the movable wall, boundary layer suction is applied on it. Complementary measurements (surface static pressure distributions, surface flow visualizations by means of wall mounted tufts, instantaneous and time-averaged velocity fields in the meridional and cross-stream planes by means of Particle Image Velocimetry) have been used to survey the flow with and without vortex generators. Three different pressure gradients, which induce turbulent separation in absence of boundary layer control, were tested. Vortex generators height and location effects on separation reduction and pressure recovery increase were investigated. For the most effective VGs configurations detailed analyses of the flow field were performed, that demonstrate the effectiveness of this passive control device to control separation in diffusing ducts. Particle Image Velocimetry vector and vorticity plots illustrate the mechanisms by which the vortex generators transfer momentum towards the surface, re-energizing the near-wall flow and preserving the boundary layer from separation...|$|R
