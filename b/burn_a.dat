5|$|K Foundation <b>Burn</b> <b>a</b> Million Quid was {{an action}} on 23 August 1994 {{in which the}} K Foundation (an art duo {{consisting}} of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty) burned cash {{in the amount of}} one million pounds sterling in a disused boathouse on the Ardfin Estate on the Scottish island of Jura. The money represented the bulk of the K Foundation's funds, earned by Drummond and Cauty as The KLF, one of the United Kingdom's most successful pop groups of the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|On 23 August 1995, {{exactly one}} year after the burning, Drummond and Cauty {{returned}} to Jura for the premier screening of the film, now known as Watch the K Foundation <b>Burn</b> <b>a</b> Million Quid.

5|$|At the foundry {{near the}} Carey Street Bridge, {{a crowd of}} more than 100 {{gathered}} and threatened to {{set fire to the}} area. A contingent of the 5th under Captain Lipscomb arrived, and a volley fired {{over the heads of the}} crowd was sufficient to dissuade the crowd. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to <b>burn</b> <b>a</b> B transportation barge at Fell's Point. The news reported that 16 were arrested in a confrontation between citizens and the police at Lee and Eutaw, and that during the night, three separate attempts were made to set fire the 6th Regiment armory, but all were frustrated by the remaining garrison there.|$|E
5|$|The cunning Fox is {{commonly}} found in Native American mythology, where it is portrayed as an almost constant companion to Coyote. Fox, however, is a deceitful companion that often steals Coyote's food. In the Achomawi creation myth, Fox and Coyote are the co-creators of the world, that leave just {{before the arrival of}} humans. The Yurok tribe believed that Fox, in anger, captured the sun, and tied him to a hill, causing him to <b>burn</b> <b>a</b> great hole in the ground. An Inuit story tells of how Fox, portrayed as a beautiful woman, tricks a hunter into marrying her, only to resume her true form and leave after he offends her. A Menominee story tells of how Fox is an untrustworthy friend to the Wolf.|$|E

5|$|The {{incineration}} {{was recorded}} on a Hi-8 video camera by K Foundation collaborator Gimpo. In August 1995, the film—Watch the K Foundation <b>Burn</b> <b>a</b> Million Quid—was toured around the UK, with Drummond and Cauty engaging each audience in {{debate about the}} burning and its meaning. In November 1995, the duo pledged to dissolve the K Foundation and to refrain from public discussion of the burning {{for a period of}} 23 years, but Drummond spoke about the burning in 2000 and 2004. Initially, he was unrepentant, but in 2004 he admitted to the BBC that he regretted burning the money.|$|E
5|$|In early October 1942, Jevđević and Baćović, with 3,000 Chetniks from Herzegovina and {{southeast}} Bosnia, {{participated in the}} Italian-led Operation Alfa. This involved a two-pronged thrust towards the town of Prozor. German and NDH troops drove from the north, and Italian and Chetnik forces pushed from the Neretva River. Prozor and some smaller towns were captured by the combined Italian–Chetnik force. Individual Chetnik bands, acting on their own, proceeded to <b>burn</b> <b>a</b> number of Muslim and Catholic villages, and killed between 543 and 2,500 non-Serbs in the Prozor area. Their behaviour angered the NDH government and the Italians had to order the Chetniks to withdraw. Some were discharged altogether while others were sent to northern Dalmatia to aid Đujić's forces. A month after the massacre, Jevđević and Baćović wrote a self-critical report on Prozor to Mihailović, hoping {{to distance themselves from}} the actions of the troops.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{development}} of coordinated fleets of ships capable of landing an invasion force, naval warfare {{has been an important}} aspect in the defense (or conquest) of maritime states. The first naval battle in recorded history saw Suppiluliuma II of the Hittites <b>burn</b> <b>a</b> Cypriot fleet at sea in 1210 BC. Shortly after, the fleets of the Sea Peoples disrupted the entire Eastern Mediterranean: over a period of about 50 years, raids and invasions violently destroyed nearly every coastal city between Pylos and Gaza. As empires grew and their armies became too large to live off the lands through which they passed, disruption of their supply fleets also became a powerful tactic. The 480 BC Battle of Salamis largely determined the course of the Persian Wars not because of its inherent damage (however considerable) but because Themistocles's deception and superior strategy left the Athenians capable of disrupting sea-borne supplies at will and potentially striking at the pontoon bridges across the Hellespont, cutting off the Persians' line of retreat. During the age of wooden ships, however, great fleets were burdensome to maintain and always liable to destruction by contrary weather, most famously {{in the case of the}} two kamikaze typhoons that destroyed the Mongol invasions of Japan in AD 1274 and 1281.|$|E

5|$|These ancient traditions have modern, reduced versions. Modern houses {{usually have}} no ognjište {{on which to}} <b>burn</b> <b>a</b> badnjak, {{but it may be}} symbolically {{represented}} by several oak twigs, some of which are burnt in a wood-burning kitchen stove and the others placed beside it. Some people chop the badnjak into shorter logs {{so that they can be}} put into the hearth and burnt. The most prevalent custom, however, is to place a cluster of oak twigs, with their brown leaves still attached, in whichever location in the home the family feels is appropriate. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve. For the convenience of those living in towns and cities, such little badnjaks can be bought at marketplaces or distributed in churches. In a common arrangement, the cluster of oak twigs is bound together with twigs of European Cornel and several stalks of straw.|$|E
