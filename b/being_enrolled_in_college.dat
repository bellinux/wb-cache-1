50|$|Several {{studies have}} {{concluded}} that overall, more black males are in prison than are <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>colleges</b> and universities. <b>In</b> 2000 there were 791,600 black men in prison and 603,032 <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>college</b> versus 1980, when there were 143,000 black men in prison and 463,700 <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>college.</b> <b>In</b> 2003, according to Justice Department figures, 193,000 black college-age men were in prison, while 532,000 black college-age men were attending college. On an average day in 1996, more black male high school dropouts aged 20-35 were in custody than in paid employment; by 1999, over one-fifth of black non-college men in their early 30’s had prison records.|$|R

40|$|It {{is likely}} that the extent of {{progression}} in the educational system a effects whether or not one decides to start a family at a given point in time. We estimate the effect of <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>college</b> <b>in</b> the year of application on later family formation decisions such as the probability of being a parent at a certain age. Using college admission data, we nd that individuals who are above the grade requirement for their preferred college program are more likely to <b>enroll</b> <b>in</b> <b>college</b> <b>in</b> a given year. Employing an IV strategy based on this idea, we nd that delays <b>in</b> <b>college</b> enrollment postpone family formation decisions. For example, we nd that the effect of <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>college</b> on the probability of being a parent at age 27 is about 9 percentage points, corresponding to an increase of about 70 percent. fertility, education...|$|R

Statewide, during our study period, the percent of high school graduates <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>college</b> <b>in</b> the fall following graduation ranged from 52 to 56 percent (THECB, 2010), but only 30 percent of graduates <b>in</b> this district <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>college.</b> Even <b>in</b> the high schools that send large numbers of students to college relative to the district overall, only 37 percent of graduates <b>enroll</b> <b>in</b> <b>college</b> (the fraction who attend <b>college</b> <b>in</b> the top 20 percent in these schools, i.e., what is reported in columns 5 and 6 of Table  1, is much higher).|$|R
