The federal government claimed the incident was an attempt to steal his police car. On October 2, 1978, the EPB and Volunteers infiltrated an armory and took 500 pounds of ammonium nitrate, dynamite cartridges, 988 <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> and 17,500 feet of primacord. In September 1979, the EPB revealed that it was working in conjunction with the Volunteers, FARP and FALN.|$|E
5|$|Federal agents {{obtained}} a warrant {{to search the}} house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned {{that he was being}} hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and <b>blasting</b> <b>caps,</b> the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was formally held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.|$|E
50|$|Bickford’s fuse {{not only}} {{dramatically}} improved the safety conditions of mines around the world, but {{also contributed to}} the development of dynamite. Alfred Nobel created dynamite in 1867, by moulding nitroglycerine and a mud-like compound found near his laboratories called kieselguhr into individual cylinders. At the end of each cylinder Nobel inserted a <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> which could be ignited in one of two ways. First, by inserting a safety fuse into the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> and igniting the fuse, it will set the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> off and produce enough energy to detonate the dynamite. Second, it is possible to detonate dynamite by inserting a <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> into the end of the cylinder and then by attaching an electrical wire into the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> and producing a current which will travel from the source to the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> will also set off the dynamite.|$|R

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as a combat Engineer with Company B, First Engineer Battalion, First Marine Division in connection with combat operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On 27 May 1969, Private First Class Phipps, was a member of a two-man combat engineer demolition team assigned to locate and destroy enemy artillery ordnance and concealed firing devices. After he had expended all of his explosives and <b>blasting</b> <b>caps,</b> Private First Class Phipps discovered a 175mm high explosive artillery round in a rice paddy. Suspecting that the enemy had attached at the artillery round to a secondary explosive device, he warned other Marines in the area to move to covered positions and prepared to destroy the round with a hand grenade. As he was attaching the hand grenade to a stake beside the artillery round, the fuse of the enemy's secondary explosive device ignited. Realizing that his assistant and the platoon commander were both with a few meters of him and that the imminent explosion could kill all three men, Private First Class Phipps grasped the hand grenade to his chest and dived forward to cover the enemy's explosive and the artillery round with his body, thereby shielding his companions from the detonation while absorbing the full and tremendous impact with his own body. Private First Class Phipp's indomitable courage, inspiring initiative and selfless devotion to duty saved the lives of two Marines and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E

500|$|McVeigh {{rented a}} storage {{space in which}} he stockpiled seven crates of [...] Tovex sausages, 80 spools of shock tube, and 500electric <b>blasting</b> <b>caps,</b> which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in Marion, Kansas. He decided not to steal any of the [...] of ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil) he found at the scene, as {{he did not believe}} it to be {{powerful}} enough (although he did obtain seventeenbags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb). McVeigh made a prototype bomb using a plastic Gatorade jug containing ammonium nitrate prills, liquid nitromethane, a piece of Tovex sausage, and a blasting cap. The prototype was detonated in the desert to avoid detection.|$|E

500|$|McVeigh {{then added}} a dual-fuse {{ignition}} system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled twoholes {{in the cab}} of the truck under the seat, while twoholes were also drilled {{in the body of}} the truck. Onegreen cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit to two sets of non-electric <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> which would ignite around [...] of high-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck's livery, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the [...] of Tovex Blastrite Gel [...] "sausages", which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about [...] of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast. After finishing the truck bomb, the twomen separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh with the truck to Junction City.|$|E

2500|$|It {{took four}} days to find Oughton’s remains, {{not only because of}} the amount of {{destruction}} the bomb had caused—the townhouse was destroyed—but also because of the dynamite found in the wreckage. [...] While searching through the rubble, detectives found four lead pipes, each [...] in diameter and packed with dynamite. The street was cleared, the bomb-removal truck was summoned, and the search continued with considerable caution. [...] Before the day was over, detectives found four cartons containing 57 sticks of dynamite, 30 <b>blasting</b> <b>caps,</b> and some cheap alarm clocks with holes drilled in their faces for wires. [...] It was understood later that the bombs were to be detonated at a non-commissioned officers' dance at Fort Dix.|$|E
2500|$|An initial search {{turned up}} a 1916 37-mm antitank shell. In the {{following}} days, a brick-by-brick search of the rubble uncovered 57 sticks of dynamite, four [...] pipe bombs packed with dynamite, and 30 <b>blasting</b> <b>caps.</b> [...] The pipe bombs and several eight-stick packages of dynamite had fuses already attached. [...] Also found were timing devices rigged from alarm clocks, maps of the tunnel network underneath Columbia University, and literature of the political protest organization, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), from which the Weatherman organization had split. Police described the building as a [...] "bomb factory", and said {{that at the time}} of the explosion dynamite was apparently being wrapped in tape with nails embedded to act as shrapnel.|$|E
2500|$|By mid-May, Reyat {{had gone}} into the woods to test a device with a 12-volt battery, {{cardboard}} cylinder, gunpowder, and some dynamite, but the device failed to work. The wooded area was in proximity to Duncan and Paldi. Later, Reyat acquired between six and eight sticks of dynamite [...] "to blow up unidentified stumps if need be in the future" [...] from a Duncan well driller after visiting his house to fix a truck. He also obtained a few <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> days later. On 31 May 1985, Reyat brought his timer, attached to a boombox, into his shop so that his fellow employee at Duncan Auto Marine Electric could help him fix it for a friend, but he returned the radio after it did not work properly.|$|E

50|$|On November 10, 1887, {{condemned}} prisoner Louis Lingg {{killed himself}} in his cell with a <b>blasting</b> <b>cap</b> hidden in a cigar. The next day, Parsons, August Spies, Adolph Fischer, and George Engel were executed by hanging.|$|R
2500|$|The grenade was {{rectangular}} {{in shape}} and approximately [...] in length and [...] in width, and weighed about [...] Its explosive content consisted of around [...] of blasting explosive, which was usually either ammonal or TNT. On {{the top of the}} grenade was a plate, under which the user would insert a chemical igniter, which would act as the weapon's fuse. When a vehicle drove over the grenade, its weight crushed the plate, which in turn cracked the igniter; this then leaked acid onto a sensitive chemical which detonated the charge. The grenade was designed so that it could either be thrown at a vehicle like an ordinary anti-tank grenade, or placed at a location when used as an anti-tank mine. It was also fitted with areas where <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> or cordtex could be placed, so that it {{could be used as a}} demolition charge. When the grenade was used, it was recommended that the user be within a short distance of their target, ideally concealed within a trench; if the target were an armoured vehicle, then the best areas to target were the sides and rear, where the engine compartment was located and armour was generally thinner.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, Reyat {{purchased}} a large Sanyo component tuner, model FMT 611K, at Woolworths, {{and left his}} name and telephone number on the charge slip, which was later found in a search of his home. Reyat also bought smokeless gunpowder from a sporting goods store, signing [...] "I. Reyat" [...] on the explosives log. Study of debris from the Narita explosion would eventually show the bomb had been housed inside a Sanyo tuner with a serial number matching a model sold only in British Columbia, and used a Micronta clock as a timer which powered a relay with an Eveready 12-volt battery to trigger <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> to set off a high explosive consistent with sticks of dynamite, all matching items purchased by Reyat. This would lead to his eventual conviction. As late as 2010, Reyat admitted only to buying and assembling some parts, but denied he ever made a bomb, knew what the bomb was to be used for, who was behind any plot, or that he ever asked or knew {{the name of the}} man who he said stayed in his house for a week completing construction of the explosive device after his device failed.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 August 1985, Reyat {{became a}} third suspect once the receipt for the tuner {{was found with}} his name. On 6 November 1985, the RCMP raided the homes of {{suspected}} Sikh separatists Parmar, Reyat, Gill and Johal. [...] In a 4 1/2-hour interview, Reyat denied all knowledge of the test blast or even Parmar. After he was told the CSIS had seen both of them, he changed his story that Parmar really {{wanted to build a}} device powerful enough so that he could take the device back to India to destroy a bridge. He explained that the gunpowder in the test was a failure as the device fizzled. The search of Reyat's house produced a carton with an unusual green tape also found in the Narita blast and a can of Liquid Fire-brand starting fluid matching fragments found at the blast site, along with <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> and dynamite, including a pound of dynamite in a bag taken out its original tube casing, though none was consistent with blast residue. Reyat insisted only the clock, relays and tuner had been purchased for other than [...] "benign purposes". There was insufficient evidence to hold Parmar as charges were dropped days later.|$|E
