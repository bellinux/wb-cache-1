5|$|English doctor Maxwell (Shearsmith) {{settles into}} bunk 9E while {{travelling}} from Paris to Bourg-Saint-Maurice. Maxwell is disturbed first by Jorg (Pemberton), a drunk, flatulent German who climbs into bunk 9D, then by Kath (Hesmondhalgh) and Les (Benton), a couple travelling to their daughter's wedding. Jorg is in Les's bed, but the couple climb into 9A. Australian backpacker Shona (Gunning) enters; she places her <b>bag</b> <b>on</b> bunk 9C then leaves, and Maxwell closes the door. Kath and Les, laughing at Maxwell, begin to undress on the bed. Les wakes Jorg, but understanding is limited until Maxwell translates. Jorg switches to 9F and Les climbs into 9D.|$|E

After the {{body was found}}, the public placed flowers near the scene. She wore only a pair of white leggings designed with a black polka-dot pattern. A zebra-print blanket was also inside the bag. Initially, police were unsure if there would be additional bodies at the scene, so they attempted unsuccessfully to use cadaver dogs to locate any other possible remains.|$|E

If a female diner had a handbag, a small side table was placed beside her so that she did not need to place the <b>bag</b> <b>on</b> the floor.

In 1998, ownership of the restaurant transferred to MPW Criterion, a holding company created by White which also owned the Titanic restaurant.|$|E
5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic <b>bag.</b> <b>On</b> receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of the gun and other technology. The introduction of firearms was important, but guns on African battlefields were often of indifferent quality, and traditional weapons and tactics sometimes compared favorably with them. Indeed, Africans {{were well aware of}} the deficiencies of trade muskets and often demanded better quality than that offered. Most guns imported from Europe had not been test fired by the manufacturer to check for imperfections in bore and breach, although this was essential in the era of hand-forged barrels. Proven guns had proof-marks, and counterfeits flourished in the Africa trade. Firearms were thus a mixed <b>bag</b> <b>on</b> the ground, and the success of consolidating native powers like the Merina in Madagascar or the Zulu were due more to changes in indigenous organization, leadership and tactics, than to firearms. As the decades rolled on however, improvements to firearms, and other technology such as disease control (the cinchona bark to suppress malaria for example), and steamships were to give Europeans a decisive military edge on the continent.|$|E
