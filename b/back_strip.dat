40|$|The present {{investigation}} was mainly concerned with characteristics of autogeneous laser butt welding of 2 [*]mm thickness nonheat treatableAA 5052 -H 12,AA 5083 -H 12 and 2 [*]mm, 3 [*]mm thickness heat treatableAA 6061 -T 6 aluminum alloys. The effect of laser welding parameters, surface cleaning, filler wire addition, and <b>backing</b> <b>strip</b> on quality of laser welded joints was clarified using 5 [*]kW CO 2 laser machine. It {{was found that}} all the investigated alloys showed tendencies for porosity and solidification cracking, particularly, at high welding speed (≥ 4 [*]m/min). Porosity was prevented by accurate cleaning of the base metal prior to welding and optimizing the flow rate of argon shielding gas. Solidification cracking was avoided through two different approaches. The first one {{is based on the}} addition of filler metal as reported in other research works. The other new approach is concerned with autogeneous welding using a <b>backing</b> <b>strip</b> from the same base metal, and this could be applicable in production. Preventing solidification cracking in both cases was related mainly to a considerable decrease in the stress concentration at the weld metal center as a result of improving the fusion zone profile. The implementation of the new approach could help in producing weldments with a better quality due to the absence of the filler metal, which is known as a source for hydrogen-related porosity. It can also have a positive economic aspect concerning the manufacturing cost since welding is done without the addition of filler metal. Not only quality and economic positive aspects could be achieved, but also high productivity is another feature since high quality autogeneous weldments were produced with high welding speed, 6 [*]m/min. Hardness measurements and tensile test of AA 6061 alloy welds indicated a remarkable softening of the fusion zone due to dissolution of the strengthening precipitates, and this was recovered by aging treatment after welding. For alloys AA 5052 and AA 5083, softening of the fusion zone due to the loss of its work-hardened condition was much less in comparison with AA 6061 alloy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In a welded structure, thick {{plates are}} joined by multi-pass welding in the butt joint. During the first pass of multi-pass welding, burn-through, lack of fusion, and {{incomplete}} penetration were readily found as weld defects. Accordingly, the backing condition should be carefully selected in welding of a thick plate, because improper backing conditions lead to weld defects. In the job site, a steel <b>backing</b> <b>strip</b> is usually adopted, although it reduces the fatigue strength. No backing conditions or removable backing is recommended to increase the fatigue strength, but selection of the proper backing and welding conditions is complicated. In this study, several backing methods, such as ceramic backing, water-cooled copper backing, and even the use of no backing, were investigated during GMA (Gas Metal Arc) welding of a thick steel plate. The {{gas metal arc welding}} conditions were established for each backing method, and the bead shape and mechanical properties were examined after welding...|$|R
