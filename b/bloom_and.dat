40|$|Cyanobacterial harmful algal <b>blooms</b> <b>and</b> the {{environmentally}} persistent toxins {{they produce}} are a growing global concern. One such cyanotoxin, microcystin, {{is common in}} freshwater ecosystems but {{has been known to}} enter the marine environment. Poisonings and fatalities from microcystin are recorded for livestock, pets, aquatic organisms, marine mammals, <b>and</b> humans. Microcystin <b>blooms</b> may be comprised of both toxic and nontoxic strains. Precise drivers of <b>blooms</b> <b>and</b> toxicity are conflicting in the literature. Anthropogenically derived nutrients are considered to be a significant driver of <b>blooms,</b> <b>and</b> it is predicted that climate change will only stimulate conditions that favor bloom proliferation. There is limited monitoring, testing, and legislation in the United States for microcystin and other cyanotoxins. Additional research conducted will aid managers and policy makers to formulating the best approach for mitigating <b>blooms</b> <b>and</b> microcystin...|$|R

An ongoing {{initiative}} is being made to put in plants which provide interest throughout the season or are at their best in the late summer. There are now many species and colours of lavender and plenty of agapanthus, crinum, nerines and day lilies, together with such rarities as a Heptacodium and an Arbutus menziesii.|$|E
5|$|Cartier {{was still}} able to direct several notable {{productions}} during the decade, including a number which explored the Nazi era in Germany from which he had escaped in 1933. These included the World War II dramas Cross of Iron (1961, dealing with the court martial of a U-Boat captain in a British prisoner of war camp) and The July Plot (1964, about the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler), as well as Firebrand (1967, about the 1933 Reichstag fire, an event Cartier had personally witnessed). He also began, for the first time, to direct pieces which dealt with the Holocaust, such as Doctor Korczak and the Children (Studio 4 , 1962), concerning the Warsaw Ghetto orphanage, and The Joel Brand Story (1965, about Adolf Eichmann's 1944 offer to the Allies of the lives of 1 million Jews in exchange for 10,000 trucks). Other significant 1960s productions included adaptations of Anna Karenina (1961, starring Sean Connery and Claire <b>Bloom)</b> <b>and</b> Wuthering Heights (1962, a new version of Kneale's 1953 script, starring <b>Bloom</b> <b>and</b> Keith Michell). Lee Oswald — Assassin (1966) was a drama-documentary telling the story of Lee Harvey Oswald, based on the Warren Commission's findings, while Conversation at Night (1969) saw the first television acting appearance of Alec Guinness.|$|E
5|$|Although Susan Hayward was {{reported}} to be in the running for one of the two female leads, Julie Harris was chosen for the role of Eleanor Lance. Wise had seen Harris on stage, and felt she was right for the part of the psychologically fragile Eleanor. Harris agreed to do the film in part because the role was complex and the idea of the house taking over Eleanor's mind was interesting. But she also chose it because she had a long-standing interest in parapsychology. English actress Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast <b>Bloom</b> <b>and</b> Johnson was because of Eady Levy requirements that the cast be partly British. To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, beatnik clothing designer Mary Quant was hired to design mod clothing specifically for the Theodora character.|$|E

5|$|Directors of {{the series}} include Gore Verbinski (1–3), Rob Marshall(4) and Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg (5). The series is {{primarily}} written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (1–4); other writers include Stuart Beattie (1), Jay Wolpert (1) and Jeff Nathanson (5). The stories follow the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando <b>Bloom)</b> <b>and</b> Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Characters such as Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally) follow Jack, Will and Elizabeth {{in the course of}} the films. The fourth film features Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and Angelica (Penélope Cruz), while the fifth film features Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem), Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario). The films take place in a fictional historical setting; a world ruled by the British Empire, the East India Trading Company (based on the real East India Company) and the Spanish Empire, with pirates representing freedom from the ruling powers.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to <b>bloom</b> <b>and</b> a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{and animals}} {{living in the}} desert need special adaptations {{to survive in the}} harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, {{water-resistant}} cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, <b>bloom</b> <b>and</b> die {{in the course of a}} few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.|$|E

5|$|The poetic {{versions}} of the story allude to additional matter within the tradition of Mac Da Thó's pig, including the names of Mac Da Thó's wife Maine Athrai, of his two sons, and of his grandson Léna. According to these accounts, Léna first found the pig in Slieve <b>Bloom,</b> <b>and</b> was responsible for its nourishment until it had seven inches of fat on its snout. Maine Athrai needed the pig for her husband's great feast; Léna refused, but he was killed when the pig grubbed up earth with its snout, burying him alive in his sleep. In {{this version of the}} tale, which shows how much may have been omitted from the narrow version of the saga, Mac Da Thó's swineherd Follscaide dutifully delivers the pig to his master's feast.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Pictures {{released}} {{the film in}} the United States on May 25, 2007. Critical reviews were mixed; the film was praised for its performances, musical score, action scenes, and special effects, but was criticized for its plot and running time. At World's End was a box office hit, becoming the most successful film of 2007, with over $960 million worldwide. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling and the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, which it lost to La Vie en Rose and The Golden Compass, respectively. A sequel, , {{the first in the}} series to neither be directed by Verbinski nor star <b>Bloom</b> <b>and</b> Knightley, was released in cinemas on May 20, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In late 1945 {{and early}} 1946 Gielgud toured for ENSA in the Middle and Far East with Hamlet and Coward's Blithe Spirit. During this tour he played Hamlet on {{stage for the}} last time. He was Raskolnikoff in a stage version of Crime and Punishment, in the West End in 1946 and on Broadway the {{following}} year. Agate thought it the best thing Gielgud had done so far, other than Hamlet. Between these two engagements Gielgud toured North America in The Importance of Being Earnest and Love for Love. Edith Evans was tired {{of the role of}} Lady Bracknell, and refused to join him; Margaret Rutherford played the part to great acclaim. Gielgud was in demand as a director, with six productions in 1948–49. They included The Heiress in 1949, when he was brought in at the last moment to direct Richardson and Ashcroft, saving what seemed a doomed production; it ran for 644 performances. His last big hit of the 1940s was as Thomas Mendip in The Lady's Not for Burning, which he also directed. The London cast included the young Claire <b>Bloom</b> <b>and</b> Richard Burton, who went with Gielgud when he took the piece to the US the following year.|$|E

5|$|With the {{appearance}} of both Ulysses and T. S. Eliot's poem, The Waste Land, 1922 was a key year {{in the history of}} English-language literary modernism. In Ulysses, Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and virtually every other literary technique to present his characters. The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the Odyssey of Homer in modern Dublin and represents Odysseus (Ulysses), Penelope and Telemachus in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly <b>Bloom</b> <b>and</b> Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model. In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of Thom's Directory—a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.|$|E
5|$|The {{play has}} been widely adapted for TV and film. In 1960, Peter Ustinov's cold-war stage parody, Romanoff and Juliet was filmed. The 1961 film of West Side Story—set among New York gangs–featured the Jets as white youths, {{equivalent}} to Shakespeare's Montagues while the Sharks, equivalent to the Capulets, are Puerto Rican. The 1994 film The Punk uses both the rough plot outline of Romeo and Juliet and names many {{of the characters in}} ways that reflect the characters in the play. In 2006, Disney's High School Musical made use of Romeo and Juliet plot, placing the two young lovers in different high school cliques instead of feuding families. Film-makers have frequently featured characters performing scenes from Romeo and Juliet. The conceit of dramatising Shakespeare writing Romeo and Juliet has been used several times, including John Madden's 1998 Shakespeare in Love, in which Shakespeare writes the play against the backdrop of his own doomed love affair. An anime series produced by Gonzo and SKY Perfect Well Think, called Romeo x Juliet, was made in 2007 and the 2013 version is the latest English-language film based on the play. In 2013, Sanjay Leela Bhansali directed the Bollywood film Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, a contemporary version of the play which starred Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in leading roles. The film was a commercial and critical success. In February 2014, BroadwayHD released a filmed version of the 2013 Broadway Revival of Romeo and Juliet. The production starred Orlando <b>Bloom</b> <b>and</b> Condola Rashad. The film was released internationally in April 2014.|$|E
