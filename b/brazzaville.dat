5|$|Aubame {{participated in}} the 1944 <b>Brazzaville</b> Conference and served in this post until 10 November 1946. After Éboué's sudden death in March 1944, Aubame worked {{as an adviser to}} Governor-General André Bayardelle and his {{secretary}} André Soucadoux. They encouraged Aubame to run for office, and he returned to Gabon to campaign with the support of both the administration and the missionaries.|$|E
5|$|During the First Congo War, the Angolan {{government}} {{joined the}} coalition to overthrow Mobutu's government {{due to his}} support for UNITA. Mobutu's government fell to the opposition coalition on 16 May 1997. The Angolan government chose to act primarily through Katangese gendarmes called the Tigres, which were proxy groups formed from the descendents of police units who had been exiled from Zaire and thus were fighting {{for a return to}} their homeland. Luanda did also deploy regular troops. In early October 1997, Angola invaded the Republic of the Congo during its civil war, and helped Sassou Nguesso's rebels overthrow the government of Pascal Lissouba. Lissouba's government had allowed UNITA the use of cities in the Republic of Congo in order to circumvent sanctions. Between 11–12 October 1997, Angolan air force fighter jets conducted a number of air strikes on government positions within <b>Brazzaville.</b> On 16 October 1997 rebel militia supported by tanks and a force of 1,000 Angolan troops cemented their control of <b>Brazzaville</b> forcing Lisouba to flee. Angolan troops remained in the country fighting militia forces loyal to Lissouba engaged in a guerrilla war against the new government.|$|E
5|$|M'ba {{helped get}} him a job in customs on 24 March 1931. First {{appointed}} to Libreville from 1931 to 1935, he was transferred to Bangui in 1935 and then to <b>Brazzaville</b> in 1936, where he co-founded {{a branch of the}} Mutuelle Gabonaise with a brother of politician Louis Bigmann. He was {{also a member of the}} Association des fonctionnaires, an organization which was dominated by two other soon-to-be politicians: René-Paul Sousatte and Jean Rémy Ayouné.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the speech}} given by Charles de Gaulle on the Appeal of 18 June 1940, Aubame {{sided with the}} Free French, and in November was sent by Libreville {{authorities}} to rally Fangs for the cause. In February 1942, Aubame met colonial administrator Félix Éboué and quickly became his protégé. He served as an informant for Éboué on African affairs. Aubame's reward was {{to be one of}} several Africans promoted on 23 February 1943 into the European section of the civil service, and on 1 January 1944 Éboué appointed him president of the municipal commission for the Poto-Poto section of <b>Brazzaville.</b>|$|E
5|$|Malagasy {{hopes for}} greater {{sovereignty}} were stirred by remarks given by General Charles de Gaulle at the <b>Brazzaville</b> Conference in 1944, where de Gaulle announced all colonies were thereafter French overseas territories entitled to {{representation in the}} French National Assembly, and promised citizenship rights to residents of its overseas colonies. Despite the partial implementation of these reforms, forced labor on French-owned plantations and other rights abuses in Madagascar continued unabated. The nationalist secret society Panama (Patriotes nationalistes malgaches) was founded in 1941, followed in 1943 by another called Jiny after a type of local red bird. Both organizations, which sought to achieve independence by force if necessary, saw their membership swell during this period.|$|E
5|$|The Crisis {{caused the}} newly {{independent}} African states to reconsider their allegiances and internal ties. In particular, {{it led to the}} division of African states into factions. Moderate-leaning states joined the <b>Brazzaville</b> Group, which called for a degree of unity between Francophone African states and the maintenance of ties with France. Radical states joined the Casablanca Group which called for a Pan-African federation. The chaotic violence of the crisis and the fate of the country's whites, many of whom entered Northern and Southern Rhodesia as refugees, contributed to the widespread belief among whites there that black nationalist politicians were not ready to govern, and prompted fears that immediate majority rule in Rhodesia might lead to a similar situation. After negotiations with Britain repeatedly broke down, Southern Rhodesia's predominantly white government declared independence unilaterally in 1965.|$|E

5|$|During {{his early}} years, Boganda {{was adopted by}} Catholic missionaries. As a boy he {{attended}} the school opened at Mbaiki (the administrative centre for the Lobaye prefecture) by the post's founder, Lieutenant Mayer. From December 1921 to December 1922, he spent {{two hours a day}} with Monsignor Jean-Réné Calloch learning how to read, while spending the rest of his time performing manual labour. On 24 December, he was received into the church under the name Barthélemy, in honour of one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ who was believed to have worked as Christian missionary in Africa. Father Gabriel Herrau sent Boganda to the Catholic School of Betou and then to the school of the Saint Paul Mission at Bangui, where he completed his primary studies under Mgr Calloch, whom he would consider his spiritual father. The missionaries there, encouraged by his intellectual promise and pious demeanour, helped him continue secondary studies at small seminaries in <b>Brazzaville</b> and Kisantu (under Belgian Jesuits) before he moved on to the great seminary at Yaoundé. On 17 March 1938, fulfilling an ambition he had had since age twelve, he was ordained and became the first Roman Catholic priest native to Oubangui-Chari, as the colony was then called. He ministered at Bangui, Grimari and Bangassou, and in 1939, his bishop denied his request to join the French Army. He was needed at home, as many Frenchmen involved with the church had been recalled to the metropole to fight in World War II, during which he served in a number of missions.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the decolonization {{process of}} West Africa French territories, since the <b>Brazzaville’s</b> Conference until the obtaining of Independence. The {{aim of this}} research project refers {{to the importance of}} French Soudan, nowadays Mali, in French West Africa, and how the leaders of this territory conducted the dialogue with the colonial authorities. The Soudan’s political elite followed the political direction dictated by Houphouet-Boigny, leader of the political movement which connected French territories in this area, until the decision of breaking free from this position. Modibo Keita, father of the Nation of Mali, developed new alliances between the RDA leadership, but also with other political parties and leaders, such as Senghor. Keita and the Senegalese leader tried to avoid the balkanization of West Africa, proposing a project which was based on the principles of African Unity...|$|R
5000|$|Many of {{the most}} {{influential}} musicians of Congo's history emerged from {{one or more of these}} big bands, including the colossus Franco Luambo Makiadi usually referred to simply as [...] "Franco", Sam Mangwana, Ndombe Opetum, Vicky Longomba, Dizzy Madjeku and Kiamanguana Verckys. Mangwana was the most popular of these solo performers, keeping a loyal fanbase even while switching from Vox Africa and Festival des Marquisards to Afrisa, followed by OK Jazz and a return to Africa before setting up a West African group called the African All Stars. Mose Fan Fan of OK Jazz also proved influential, bringing Congolese rumba to East Africa, especially Kenya, after moving there in 1974 with Somo Somo. Rumba also spread through the rest of Africa, with <b>Brazzaville's</b> Pamelo Mounk'a and Tchico Thicaya moving to Abidjan and Ryco Jazz taking the Congolese sound to the French Antilles.|$|R
30|$|During this programme, both {{urban and}} rural areas were {{investigated}} enabling to have a larger picture of the burden of dementia in those countries. Sampling methods were yet different. A sampling proportional {{to the size of the}} main subdivision of each capital was applied in both urban areas. Indeed in both capitals distribution of ethnic groups differs from one subdivision to another. The definition of a catchment area within the city would not have permitted to recruit a sample of participants fully representative of the Bangui and <b>Brazzaville’s</b> inhabitants. Furthermore, door-to-door studies in defined catchment areas of both cities have been carried out previously (Guerchet et al. 2010). An exhaustive sampling, by a door-to-door knocking, was preferred in rural areas. This procedure was more suitable in areas where addresses are completely inexistent, and will allow us to tag the participants for further studies more easily. Data collection in a geographically defined area was also financially and logistically (i.e. blood sample procedure) feasible. However, as distribution of ethnic groups differs from one region to another in both countries, we are aware that the results reported for rural areas would not necessarily be generalizable to any other rural area within the country.|$|R
