Because a spinning projectile experiences both precession and nutation about its center of gravity as it flies, further data reduction of doppler radar measurements is required to separate yaw induced drag and lift coefficients from the zero yaw drag coefficient, in order to make measurements fully applicable to 6-dof trajectory analysis.|$|R

5000|$|A new Spitzgeschoß {{aerodynamic}} bullet, {{credited to}} an independent <b>ballistician</b> Arthur Gleinich, was tested in 1902 and officially adopted on 3 April 1903. After several shape revisions it entered mass production in 1904. The Spitzgeschoß nose was externally pointed like the French design and its shape was patented, but the full metal jacket Spitzgeschoß differed internally. The Gewehr-Prüfungskommission program resulted in the S Patrone a.k.a. 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge, which was loaded with a relatively lightweight 9.9 g spitzer bullet with a slightly increased diameter of 8.2 mm that had a ballistic coefficient (G1 BC) of approximately 0.321 to 0.337 (ballistic coefficients are somewhat debatable), along with a dimensionally redesigned chambering and bore (designated as [...] "S-bore") and new double-base (based on nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin) smokeless powder loading, which delivered a greatly improved muzzle velocity of 878 m/s from a 740 mm barrel. The S Patrone {{was adopted by the}} German Army and Navy in 1903 and had a maximum range of approximately 3700 m. The combination of increased muzzle velocity and improved bullet aerodynamics provided a much flatter bullet trajectory, which increased the probability of hitting an individual target at most typical combat distances.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{velocity}} of a projectile fired at supersonic muzzle velocity approaches {{the speed of sound}} it enters the transonic region (about Mach 1.2-0.8). In the transonic region, the centre of pressure (CP) of most non spherical projectiles shifts forward as the projectile decelerates. That CP shift affects the (dynamic) stability of the projectile. If the projectile is not well stabilized, it can not remain pointing forward through the transonic region (the projectile starts to exhibit an unwanted precession or coning motion called limit cycle yaw that, if not damped out, can eventually end in uncontrollable tumbling along the length axis). However, even if the projectile has sufficient stability (static and dynamic) to be able to fly through the transonic region and stays pointing forward, it is still affected. The erratic and sudden CP shift and (temporary) decrease of dynamic stability can cause significant dispersion (and hence significant accuracy decay), even if the projectile's flight becomes well behaved again when it enters the subsonic region. This makes accurately predicting the ballistic behavior of projectiles in the transonic region very difficult. Because of this, marksmen normally restrict themselves to engaging targets within the supersonic range of the projectile used.In 2015 the American <b>ballistician</b> Bryan Litz introduced the [...] "Extended Long Range" [...] concept to define rifle shooting at ranges where supersonic fired (rifle) bullets enter the transonic region. According to Litz, [...] "Extended Long Range starts whenever the bullet slows to its transonic range. As the bullet slows down to approach Mach 1, it starts to encounter transonic effects, which are more complex and difficult to account for, compared to the supersonic range where the bullet is relatively well-behaved." ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this talk, I {{would like}} to explore the various methods used during 18 th and 19 th centuries to numerically {{integrate}} the ballistic differential equation and to calculate firing tables {{for the needs of}} artillery. Throughout this period, there has been an interesting interaction between analytic theory of differential equations, numerical and graphical techniques of integration, and empirical research by means of experimental measures. Mathematicians, <b>ballisticians</b> and artillerymen, although belonging to different milieus, collaborated and inspired themselves mutually. All this led however to a relative failure, both experimentally to find a good law of air resistance, and mathematically to find a simple solution of the ballistic equation. Mathematical research on the ballistic equation has played nevertheless the role of a laboratory where the modern numerical analysis was able to develop. Mathematicians have indeed been able to test on this recalcitrant equation all possible approaches to calculate the solution of a differential equation. There is no doubt that these trials have helped to organize the domain into an autonomous discipline {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century...|$|R
40|$|ITC/USA 2005 Conference Proceedings / The Forty-First Annual International Telemetering Conference and Technical Exhibition / October 24 - 27, 2005 / Riviera Hotel & Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaFor years, <b>ballisticians</b> {{have been}} {{studying}} the phenomena associated with cannon launched projectiles. In particular, {{is the study of}} the pressure internal to the cannon and about the base of the projectile during cannon launch through muzzle exit. Pressure on the base is thought to be uniform and therefore hydrostatic, even though there are undulations in the magnitude of the pressure from the burning propellant. This paper studies various phenomena of the launching of 155 -mm artillery projectiles with slip band obturators. Specifically, pressure gradients in and around the base and pressure along the body caused by obturator “blow-by” during the interior ballistic flight and muzzle exit. This study is accomplished by use of two different types of Instrumented Ballistic Test Projectiles (IBTP). The objective of tests performed was to successfully capture pressure and acceleration live data which will be used to characterize the localized base and body pressurization on a 155 -mm artillery cannon launched projectile. The telemetry system used for these tests was the ARRT- 124 telemetry system provided by the Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center, specifically the Precision Munitions Instrumentation Division. The telemetry system used for the IBTP employs a traditional FM/FM technique for monitoring and transmitting a number of analog channels. Preliminary captured data indicated localized fluctuations in pressure that are not uniform over the base and the projectile body. Further studying of the data may provide insight into other projectile dynamics such as fin deployment, set forward accelerations at muzzle exit, and obturator performance...|$|R
50|$|Luis Alvarez, {{himself a}} {{sometime}} inventor, admitted to not being fully {{appreciative of the}} Aberdeen Chronograph, but seemed to understand its impact on Alfred Loomis. Alvarez wrote in his memoirs thatAlfred Loomis may well {{be remembered as the}} last of the great amateurs of science. He had distinguished careers as a lawyer, as an Army officer, and as an investment banker before he turned his full energies to the pursuit of scientific knowledge, first in the field of physics, and later as a biologist. By any measure that can be employed, {{he was one of the}} most influential physical scientists of this century.Alvarez remarked further that the chronograph was a significant invention by any measure.At Aberdeen, he was thrown into daily contact with some of the best physicists and astronomers of this country, and he and they benefited from each other's talents. In those days, before photoelectric cells and radar sets came to the aid of exterior <b>ballisticians,</b> there was no convenient way to measure the velocity of shells fired from large guns. Alfred invented the Aberdeen Chronograph, which satisfied that need for many years after its invention. It is hard for someone like me, who came into a scene long after an ingenious device had been invented, and later supplanted, to appreciate what made that device so special. But the fact that Alfred singled out the Aberdeen Chronograph for mention in his entries in Who's Who and American Men and Women of Science, and mentioned it on a number of occasions in conversations with me, makes me believe that it must have been a remarkably successful and important invention.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{advanced}} professional ballistic models like PRODAS available. These {{are based on}} {{six degrees of freedom}} (6 DoF) calculations. 6 DoF modeling accounts for x, y, and z position in space along with the projectiles pitch, yaw, and roll rates. 6 DoF modeling needs such elaborate data input, knowledge of the employed projectiles and expensive data collection and verification methods that it is impractical for non-professional ballisticians, but not impossible for the curious, computer literate, and mathematically inclined. Semi-empirical aeroprediction models have been developed that reduced extensive test range data {{on a wide variety of}} projectile shapes, normalizing dimensional input geometries to calibers; accounting for nose length and radius, body length, and boattail size, and allowing the full set of 6-dof aerodynamic coefficients to be estimated. Early research on spin-stabilized aeroprediction software resulted in the SPINNER computer program. [...] The FINNER aeroprediction code calculates 6-dof inputs for fin stabilized projectiles. [...] Solids modeling software that determines the projectile parameters of mass, center of gravity, axial and transverse moments of inertia necessary for stability analysis are also readily available, and simple to computer program. [...] Finally, algorithms for 6-dof numerical integration suitable to a 4th order Runge-Kutta are readily available. All that is required for the amateur <b>ballistician</b> to investigate the finer analytical details of projectile trajectories, along with bullet nutation and precession behavior, is computer programming determination. Nevertheless, for the small arms enthusiast, aside from academic curiosity, one will discover that being able to predict trajectories to 6-dof accuracy is probably not of practical significance compared to more simplified point mass trajectories based on published bullet ballistic coefficients. 6 DoF is generally used by the aerospace and defense industry and military organizations that study the ballistic behavior of a limited number of (intended) military issue projectiles. Calculated 6 DoF trends can be incorporated as correction tables in more conventional ballistic software applications.|$|E

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} research conducted at the Naval Postgraduate School, under an exchange agreement with the Helmut Schmidt University (German Armed Forces), in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Degree "Master of Science" in Electrical Engineering. Impact initiation of explosives {{is one of the}} more frequent referred to topics of Prof (Dr) Manfred Held, an internationally renown <b>ballistician,</b> who passed away in 2011. This thesis includes a cross-referenced bibliography of most of his published papers and patents and focuses on one of his more frequently referred topics, the impact of initiation of explosives. Experimental data from impacts against bare explosives, covered and confined with and without air gaps, and explosive and projectile dimensions are first used to validate finite difference computations required to extend and properly evaluate the database. The analyses include explosives (PBX 9404, Comp. B (65 / 35), Octol (70 / 30), H 6, TNT) and projectiles (aluminum, steel, copper, tantalum) of much varied properties and sensitivities. Assuming that close examination of the experimental data proposed by Held and others to rate the relative threshold sensitivity of explosives to impact (incl., (v 2 d), (u 2 d), (ρv 2 d) and (ρ 1 / 2 v 2 d)) deviate significantly from constancy, in some cases greater than 50 percent. It is found that the product of interfacial impact pressure and well-defined projectile diameter is a much more reliable predictor of the impact sensitivity of a bare explosive based on the smaller deviation from mean values relative to the aforementioned terms. Importantly, this energy term takes into account the density and Hugoniot properties of both impactor and explosive.

As expected, with decreased wounding effects, rapid incapacitation is unlikely: enemy soldiers may continue to {{pose a threat to}} friendly forces and violent suspects can remain a danger to law enforcement personnel and the public.This failure of 5.56×45mm NATO bullets to yaw can be caused by reduced impact velocities as when fired from short-barreled weapons or when the range to the target increases. Failure to yaw and fragment can also occur when the bullets pass through only minimal tissue, such as a limb or the chest of a thin, small statured individual, as the bullet may exit the body before it has a chance to yaw and fragment. Two other yaw issues: Angle-of-Attack (AOA) variations between different projectiles, even within the same lot of ammo, as well as Fleet Yaw variations between different rifles, were elucidated in 2006 by the Joint Service Wound Ballistic Integrated Product Team (JSWB-IPT), which included experts from the military law enforcement user community, trauma surgeons, aero <b>ballisticians,</b> weapon and munitions engineers, and other scientific specialists.

40|$|Ballistics can {{be defined}} as the science of firearms, gun systems and their {{accompanying}} propellants and projectiles. More generally, it is the study of the behaviour of projectiles and how they are delivered to and defeat a target. Ballistic theory is divided into four distinct phases; the internal, intermediate (also referred to as transitional), external and terminal. Through the study of ballistics, explosive ordnance engineers and <b>ballisticians</b> can design munitions that defeat targets efficiently while reducing collateral damage. Contemporary study of ballistics has been able to characterise and model accurately two of the ballistics phases; namely the internal and external phase. This is due to the complex relationships that exist for the intermediate and terminal effects phases. Although a range of assumptions can be made to reduce the complexity of the relationships, in order to develop simulations or models, it is more accurate and efficient to utilise real world test and evaluation activities to understand their effects on safety and suitability. In the case of terminal ballistics, it is difficult to observe the projectile making contact with different target sets due to type of terminal effect or the clutter/noise caused during the event. However, observations can be made post-test which can confirm the validity of any model. This paper discusses the use of the formal test methodology, Design of Experiment (DOE) testing; to identify, understand and probabilistically model the significant factors effecting terminal performance against soft targets. This formal methodology allows for each factor and their interactions to be identified, isolated and used in small arms wounding models and simulations. Utilising a case study of the 5. 56 mm M 855 A 1 enhanced performance round and 7. 62 mm M 80 projectile, small arms terminal performance is better understood as a baseline for future developments within those calibres and weapon systems.
