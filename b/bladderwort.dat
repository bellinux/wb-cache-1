5|$|Utricularia purpurea, a <b>bladderwort,</b> {{comes from}} another genus of {{carnivorous}} plants {{and may have}} lost its appetite for carnivory, at least in part. This species can still trap and digest arthropod prey in its specialized bladder traps, but does so sparingly. Instead, it harbors a community of algae, zooplankton, and debris in the bladders, giving rise to {{the hypothesis that the}} bladders of U. purpurea favor a mutualistic interaction in place of a predator-prey relationship.|$|E
5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf <b>bladderwort,</b> in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E
25|$|Lake Jean used to {{experience}} a <b>bladderwort</b> infestation. At its most severe point, Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources employees had to rake <b>bladderwort</b> off the lake's beaches on a daily basis. However, <b>bladderwort</b> populations have been reduced since the lake became less acidic, and the lake's plant biodiversity has increased. Most of the forests in the lake's watershed are deciduous forests. However, some areas of conifer forest are present, especially in the watershed's western part. Small waterwort and Sphinx gordius also inhabit the lake.|$|E

25|$|Bladder traps are {{exclusive}} to the genus Utricularia, or <b>bladderworts.</b> The bladders (vesicula) pump ions {{out of their}} interiors. Water follows by osmosis, generating a partial vacuum inside the bladder. The bladder has a small opening, sealed by a hinged door. In aquatic species, the door has a pair of long trigger hairs. Aquatic invertebrates such as Daphnia touch these hairs and deform the door by lever action, releasing the vacuum. The invertebrate is sucked into the bladder, where it is digested. Many species of Utricularia (such as U. sandersonii) are terrestrial, growing in waterlogged soil, and their trapping mechanism is triggered {{in a slightly different}} manner. <b>Bladderworts</b> lack roots, but terrestrial species have anchoring stems that resemble roots. Temperate aquatic <b>bladderworts</b> generally die back to a resting turion during the winter months, and U. macrorhiza appears to regulate the number of bladders it bears in response to the prevailing nutrient content of its habitat.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{carnivorous}} plant Utricularia cornigera Studnička {{was described in}} 2009, but author-ities of the International Carnivorous Plant Society published an opinion {{that it is not}} a true species, but only a natural hybrid of U. reniformis and U. nelumbifolia. The role of heterosis is discussed, because U. cornigera is much larger than both theoretical parents. Seedlings, the very characteristic feature of <b>bladderworts</b> (Utricularia), are different in all the <b>bladderworts</b> described, that is, in the named species and in artificial hybrids of U. nelumbifolia and U. reniformis. No support for the hypothesis supposing a hybrid origin of U. cornigera was found...|$|R
25|$|As {{with almost}} all {{carnivorous}} plants, the flowers of butterworts are held {{far above the}} rest of the plant by a long stalk, {{in order to reduce the}} probability of trapping potential pollinators. The single, long-lasting flowers are zygomorphic, with two lower lip petals characteristic of the <b>bladderwort</b> family, and a spur extending from the back of the flower. The calyx has five sepals, and the petals are arranged in a two-part lower lip and a three-part upper lip. Most butterwort flowers are blue, violet or white, often suffused with a yellow, greenish or reddish tint. P. laueana and the newly described P. caryophyllacea are unique in having a strikingly red flowers. Butterworts are often cultivated and hybridized primarily for their flowers.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 15 February 1995, {{the final}} episode deals with plants {{that live in}} hostile environments. Attenborough visits Ellesmere Island, north of the Arctic Circle, to {{demonstrate}} that even {{in a place that}} is unconducive to life, it can be found. Algae and lichens grow in or on rock, and during summer, when the ice melts, flowers are much more apparent. However, they must remain close to the ground {{to stay out of the}} chilling wind. In the Tasmanian mountains, plants conserve heat by growing into 'cushions' that act as solar panels, with as many as a million individual shoots grouped together as one. Others, such as the lobelia in Mount Kenya, have a 'fur coat' of dense hairs on their leaves. The saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Desert flourishes because of its ability to retain vast amounts of water, which can't be lost through leaves because it has none. Many desert dwellers benefit from an accelerated life cycle, blooming rapidly within weeks after rainfall. Conversely, Mount Roraima is one of the wettest places on Earth. It is a huge sandstone plateau with high waterfalls and nutrients are continuously washed away, so plants have to adapt their diet if they are to survive. A <b>bladderwort</b> is shown invading a bromeliad. Inhabitants of lakes have other problems to contend with: those that dominate the surface will proliferate, and the Amazon water lily provides an apt illustration. Attenborough ends the series with an entreaty for the conservation of plant species.|$|E
500|$|Sloughs, or {{free-flowing}} {{channels of}} water, develop in between sawgrass prairies. Sloughs are about [...] deeper than sawgrass marshes, and may stay flooded {{for at least}} 11months {{out of the year}} and sometimes multiple years in a row. Aquatic animals such as turtles, alligators, snakes, and fish thrive in sloughs; they usually feed on aquatic invertebrates. Submerged and floating plants grow here, such as <b>bladderwort</b> (Utricularia), waterlily (Nymphaeaceae), and spatterdock (Nuphar lutea). Major sloughs in the Everglades system include the Shark River Slough flowing out to Florida Bay, Lostmans River Slough bordering The Big Cypress, and Taylor Slough in the eastern Everglades.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bladderworts</b> are {{unusual and}} highly {{specialized}} plants, and the vegetative organs are not clearly separated into roots, leaves, and stems {{as in most}} other angiosperms.

2500|$|The name <b>bladderwort</b> {{refers to}} the bladder-like traps. [...] The aquatic members of the genus have {{the largest and most}} obvious bladders, and these were {{initially}} thought to be flotation devices before their carnivorous nature was discovered.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{species of}} aquatic plants {{are present in}} the lake: reed, common club-rush, water horsetail, narrow leaf cattail, white beak-sedge, gypsywort, bulbous rush, white waterlily, {{broad-leaved}} pondweed, alternate water-milfoil, and intermediate <b>bladderwort.</b> [...] Along the shores are grey willow, goat willow, aspen, black alder, bog-myrtle, tall bog-sedge, common sedge, bottle sedge, slender sedge, cranberry, and round-leaved sundew.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main part}} of a <b>bladderwort</b> plant always lies {{beneath the surface of}} its substrate. [...] Terrestrial species {{sometimes}} produce a few photosynthetic leaf-shoots which lie unobtrusively flat against the surface of their soil, and in almost all species only the flowering stems rise above and are prominent. [...] This means that the terrestrial species are generally visible only while they are in flower, although aquatic species can be observed below the surfaces of ponds and streams.|$|E

50|$|Hibernaculum (plural hibernacula) is {{the term}} often applied to a winter bud of certain aquatic plants, such as the <b>bladderworts</b> (Utricularia). The buds are heavier than water, and, being {{developed}} at the approach of cold weather, they become detached, sink {{to the bottom of}} the pond, and thus survive the winter. In the spring, they enlarge, developing air spaces, rise to the surface, and reproduce their species.|$|R
2500|$|Herbaceous macrophytes {{present in}} the reserve also provide {{important}} habitats for birds, otters and other wildlife [...] and include reeds (Phragmites spp.); sedges (Cyperus spp.), rushes (Scirpus spp.); Spike-rush (Eleocharis spp.); Grey Sedge (Lepironia articulata); Rice Grass (Paspalum scrobiculatum) and other grasses (Scleria spp.); Sacred Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera); White Lotus (Nymphaea lotus); Blue lotus (Nymphaea nouchali); Water Snowflake (Nymphoides indica); Asian Watermoss (Salvinia cucullata); Golden <b>Bladderwort</b> (Utricularia aurea); Hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum); Green Algae (Chara spp.) and myriad other Phytoplankton species. Many macrophyte populations form dense floating patches on the lake surface providing refuge and habitat for both mobile and sessile organisms.|$|E
2500|$|All Utricularia are {{carnivorous}} {{and capture}} small organisms {{by means of}} bladder-like traps. Terrestrial species tend to have tiny traps that feed on minute prey such as protozoa and rotifers swimming in water-saturated soil. The traps can {{range in size from}} 0.2mm to 1.2cm. Aquatic species, such as U.vulgaris (common <b>bladderwort),</b> possess bladders that are usually larger and can feed on more substantial prey such as water fleas (Daphnia), nematodes and even fish fry, mosquito larvae and young tadpoles. Despite their small size, the traps are extremely sophisticated. In the active traps of the aquatic species, prey brush against trigger hairs connected to the trapdoor. The bladder, when [...] "set", is under negative pressure in relation to its environment so that when the trapdoor is mechanically triggered, the prey, along with the water surrounding it, is sucked into the bladder. Once the bladder is full of water, the door closes again, the whole process taking only ten to fifteen thousandths of a second.|$|E
60|$|Only {{one year}} elapsed between the {{publication}} of the 'Descent of Man' and that of its next important successor, the 'Expression of the Emotions.' The occasion of this learned and bulky treatise in itself stands as an immortal proof of the conscientious way in which Darwin went to work to anticipate the slightest and most comparatively impertinent possible objections to his main theories. Sir Charles Bell, in one of the quaintly antiquated Bridgwater treatises--those marvellous monuments of sadly misplaced teleological ingenuity--had maintained that man was endowed with sundry small facial muscles solely for the sake of expressing his emotions. This view was so obviously opposed to the belief in the descent of man from some lower form, 'that,' says Darwin, 'it was necessary for me to consider it;' and so he did, in a lengthy work, where the whole subject is exhaustively treated, and Bell's idea is completely pulverised by the apt allegation of analogous expressions in the animal world. In his old age Darwin grew, in fact, only the more ceaselessly and wonderfully industrious. In 1875, after three years of comparative silence, came the 'Insectivorous Plants,' a work full of minute observation on the habits and manners of the sundew, the butterwort, the Venus's fly-catcher, and the various heterogeneous bog-haunting species known by the common name of pitcher plants. The bare mass and weight of the facts which Darwin had collected for the 'Origin of Species' might well-nigh have stifled the very existence of that marvellous book: it was lucky that the premature publication of Wallace's paper compelled him to hurry on his 'brief abstract,' for if he had waited to select and arrange the whole series of observations that he finally published in his various later justificatory volumes, we might have looked in vain for the great systematic and organising work, which would no doubt have been 'surcharged with its own weight, and strangled with its waste fertility.' But the task that he himself best loved was to watch in minute detail the principles whose secret he had penetrated, and whose reserve he had broken, working themselves out before his very eyes, naked and not ashamed--to catch Actæon-like the undraped form of nature herself in the actual process of her inmost being. He could patiently observe the red and slimy hair-glands of the drosera closing slowly and remorselessly round the insect prey, and sucking from their bodies with sensitive tentacles the protoplasmic juices denied to its leaves by the poor and boggy soil, on which alone its scanty rootlets can properly thrive. He could watch the butterwort curving round the edges of its wan green foliage upon the captured limbs of fly or aphis. He could note how the serried mass of finger-like processes in the utricles of the <b>bladderwort</b> slowly absorb organic matter from the larva of a gnat, or the minute water-insects entangled within its living and almost animated lobster-pot. He could track the long line of treacherous honey-glands by which the sarracenia entices flies into the festering manure-wells of its sticky pitchers. The minuteness and skill of all his observations on these lesser problems of natural selection inevitably inspired faith among outsiders in the cautious judgment of the observer and experimenter; and day by day throughout his later years the evidence of the popular acceptance of his doctrine, and of the dying away of the general ridicule with which it was first received by the unlearned public, was very gratifying to the great naturalist.|$|E

25|$|The lobster-pot traps of Genlisea are {{difficult}} to interpret.
