2500|$|Morgenthau {{sought the}} aid of Peter Odegard, a {{political}} scientist specialised in propaganda, in drawing up the goals for the bond program. On the advice of Odegard the Treasury began marketing the previously successful <b>baby</b> <b>bonds</b> as [...] "defense bonds". Three new series of bond notes, Series E, F and G, would be introduced, of which Series E would be targeted at individuals as [...] "defense bonds". Like the <b>baby</b> <b>bonds,</b> they were sold {{for as little as}} $18.75 and matured in ten years, at which time the United States government paid the bondholder $25. Large denominations of between $50 and $1000 were also made available, all of which, unlike the Liberty Bonds of the First World War, were non-negotiable bonds. For those that found it difficult to purchase an entire bond at once, 10 cent savings stamps could be purchased and collected in Treasury approved stamp albums until the recipient had accumulated enough stamps for a bond purchase. The name of the bonds was eventually changed to War Bonds after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which resulted in the United States entering the war.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests {{a proportion of}} women develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after childbirth. To date, the effects of postnatal PTSD on the couple's relationship and the parent - <b>baby</b> <b>bond</b> have not been examined. In the present study, 64 couples completed questionnaires about the birth, symptoms of PTSD, the couple's relationship and parent - <b>baby</b> <b>bond</b> 9 weeks after childbirth. Results showed 5 % {{of men and women}} had severe symptoms of PTSD. Symptoms were strongly associated within couples and were related to similar birth factors for men and women. PTSD symptoms were associated with neither the parent - <b>baby</b> <b>bond</b> nor couple's relationship. The mother - <b>baby</b> <b>bond</b> was not associated with any variables measured in this study. However, the father-baby bond was associated with the couple's relationship. It is concluded that men and women have comparable levels of PTSD symptoms 9 weeks after birth. Furthermore, these results suggest postnatal symptoms of PTSD have little association with the couple's relationship or the parent - <b>baby</b> <b>bond</b> in the short term. However, {{further research is needed to}} address methodological considerations...|$|E
40|$|MCur, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Background: The {{bonding process}} {{can start to}} develop {{as early as the}} {{planning}} of a pregnancy and can affect the relationship between mother and child through childhood. If proper bonding is not established, the child can present symptoms of depression, failure to thrive or delays in social and emotional, language or motor development. Stimulation programs implemented during pregnancy may positively affect the bonding process that act as a protective factor against negative outcomes in childhood, adolescence and adult life, for instance substance abuse, poor social coping skills and academic failure. Objectives: To determine and describe the effectiveness of The <b>Baby</b> <b>Bond</b> comprehensive stimulation program on bonding six weeks post intervention. Method: The researcher employed an experimental, pre-test-post-test randomised control group design in this study. Experimental and control groups randomly received the same pre- and post-test: the Prenatal Attachment Inventory within the third trimester of pregnancy and the Maternal Attachment Inventory six weeks post birth. The <b>Baby</b> <b>Bond</b> sensory stimulation program was added to standard antenatal care for the experimental group and the control group received a general stimulation program and standard antenatal care. The data was analysed with the SPSS program version 22. 0 by the Statistical Consultation Services at the North-West University, Potchefstroom campus. SPSS was used to compile descriptive statistics from the experimental and control groups, Mann Whitney test and the effect size. Results: The twelve participants that were included in this study were from a variety of ethnic origins, in stable relationships and their ages ranged from 20 - 34 years. In the results, no statistical significant changes were found between the two groups with the Mann Whitney test. The pre-intervention variables (mean = 66. 45) were not significantly different from the post-intervention measurements (mean = 101. 03). A medium practical significant difference was identified between the groups (d= 0. 52) which can indicate that some changes in bonding did take place when implementing the comprehensive sensory stimulation program: The <b>Baby</b> <b>Bond.</b> Conclusion: The <b>Baby</b> <b>Bond</b> sensory stimulation program did not indicate a significant improved bonding as compared to general antenatal care between the mother and baby at six weeks after birth. However, future research in the optimal time for bonding interventions in larger sample sizes is needed, for more conclusive findings. Master...|$|E

25|$|By {{the summer}} of 1940, the {{victories}} of Nazi Germany against Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and France brought urgency to the government discreetly preparing for possible United States involvement in World War II. Of principal concern were issues surrounding war financing. Many of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's advisers favored a system of tax increases and enforced savings program as advocated by British economist John Maynard Keynes. In theory, this would permit increased spending while decreasing the risk of inflation. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. however preferred a voluntary loan system and began planning a national defense bond program {{in the fall of}} 1940. The intent was to unite the attractiveness of the <b>baby</b> <b>bonds</b> that had been implemented in the interwar period with the patriotic element of the Liberty Bonds from the First World War.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To assess parents 19 first {{experiences}} of their very preterm babies and the {{neonatal intensive care}} unit (NICU). Design: Qualitative study using semistructured interviews. Participants: 32 mothers and 7 fathers of very preterm babies (< 32 weeks gestation). Setting: Three neonatal units in tertiary care hospitals in South East England. Results: Five themes were identified. The first describes parents 19 blurred recall of the birth. The second shows the anticipation of seeing and touching their baby {{for the first time}} was characterised by contrasting emotions, with some parents feeling scared and others excited about the event. The third theme describes parents 19 first sight and touch of their babies and their 18 rollercoaster 19 of emotions during this time. It also highlights the importance of touch to trigger and strengthen the parent 13 <b>baby</b> <b>bond.</b> However, some parents were worried that touching or holding the baby might transmit infection or interfere with care. The fourth theme captures parents 19 impressions of NICU and how overwhelming this was particularly for parents who had not toured NICU beforehand or whose first sight of their baby was on NICU. The final theme captures unique {{experiences of}} fathers, in particular that many felt excluded and confused about their role. Conclusions: This study informs family-centred care by providing insight into the experiences of parents of very preterm infants {{at a time when they}} are most in need of support.

40|$|This is a multi-methods research, {{with the}} {{objective}} of studying the establishment of the mother and baby relationship, and build a verification tool of it from the maternal perspective. The thesis is composed by three studies: the first one aimed to characterize the content of the mothers' perception about the relationship between mother and baby, through six interviews with mothers of different educational attainment. The contents of the interviews were treated by Lexical Analysis of the Alceste software, verifying three classes, 55 % (Class 1), 26 % (Class 2) and 19 % (class 3) of the corpus, suggesting a focus of attention on the basic care. The maternal educational attainment may be an intervening factor in motherhood, and in the mother’s dynamics with her baby, influencing both the bond narrative style as the form of care. In the second study, the objective was to design and build an instrument to assess the mother and child relationship from the maternal perspective. One started from theoretical and empirical sources in order to identify and characterize the construct Mother and <b>Baby</b> <b>Bond</b> in dynamic-relational aspects. One developed an instrument of 92 items with dichotomous alternatives given to mothers of babies up to 18 months. The results generated an instrument that includes the main manifestations of child development in four periods from zero to 18 months. The third study sought to verify, through the Principal Component Analysis (PAF), the factor structure of the instrument highlighting 34 factors about the child development processes, and their maternal perception. Although the generated factors are promising, it was decided to maintain the theoretical dimensions originally proposed that served as headquarters for the organization of items. Reliability presented an acceptable index for the questionnaire concerning the baby (KR- 20 0. 92) and the relevant issues to mother (KR- 20 0. 71). As conclusion, there is the possibility of following this work, with a view to further researches, in order to come to be effectively used as an instrument for early intervention. Trata-se de uma pesquisa multi-métodos e tem por objetivo geral estudar o estabelecimento da relação mãe e bebê e construir um instrumento de verificação deste a partir da perspectiva materna. A tese está composta por 3 estudos, o primeiro buscou caracterizar o conteúdo da percepção das mães sobre a relação mãe e bebê, por meio de seis entrevistas em profundidade com mães de distintas escolaridades. Os conteúdos das entrevistas foram tratados pela Análise Lexical do software Alceste, verificando-se três classes, 55 % (classe 1), 26 % (classe 2) e 19 % (classe 3) do corpus, que sugerem um foco de atenção voltado aos cuidados básicos; podendo ser a escolaridade materna um fator interveniente na maternagem e na dinâmica da mãe com seu bebê, influenciando tanto a narrativa de estilo do laço quanto a forma do cuidado. No estudo 2 o objetivo foi elaborar e construir um instrumento para avaliar a relação mãe e bebê a partir da perspectiva materna. Partiu-se de fontes teórico-empíricas com o propósito de identificar e caracterizar o construto Laço Mãe e Bebê nos aspectos dinâmico-relacionais. Elaborou-se um instrumento de 92 itens com alternativas dicotômicas administrado à mães de bebês de até 18 meses. Os resultados geraram um instrumento que contempla as principais manifestações do desenvolvimento infantil em 4 períodos de 0 a 18 meses. O estudo 3 buscou verificar por meio da Análise de Componentes Principais (PAF) a estrutura fatorial do instrumento e evidenciou-se 34 fatores sobre os processos de desenvolvimento infantil e a percepção materna destes. Apesar de os fatores gerados serem promissores, optou-se em manter as dimensões teóricas inicialmente propostas que serviram de matriz para a organização dos itens. A confiabilidade apresentou um índice aceitável para o questionário relativo ao bebê (KR- 20 0, 92) e para as questões pertinentes a mãe (KR- 20 0, 71).

40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Winter 2015 An {{estimated}} 15 million {{babies are}} born preterm each year (before 37 weeks of pregnancy are complete). Preterm birth complications are {{the leading cause of}} death among children under 5 years of age, responsible for nearly 1 million deaths in 2013. The World Health Organization recommends that Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), where the baby is carried by the mother with skin-to-skin contact and frequent breastfeeding, is a particularly effective and safe alternative to conventional neonatal care for the management of low birth weight infants, especially in underresourced settings. KMC has been shown to prevent infections, promote breastfeeding, regulate the baby’s temperature, breathing, and brain activity, and encourage mother and <b>baby</b> <b>bonding.</b> Initiated in hospitals, KMC has the potential to reduce reduce newborn deaths by 51 % for preterm babies who are stable.

40|$|Introduction: Some {{mothers do}} {{not comply with}} {{breastfeeding}} due to unawareness of the practice. Aims: To characterize the demographic and obstetrical profile of postpartum women and to verify the influence of their instruction level {{and the number of}} prenatal consultations on breastfeeding knowledge. Design: Descriptive and quantitative study. Method: Individual interviews were carried out with 150 postpartum women at a public maternity rooming-in. The data were processed in the SPSS, version 13. 0. Results: Most women were between 18 and 35 years old, less than eight schooling years; 91 (60. 7 %) were multiparae and 87 (58 %) had not breastfed previously. Increased knowledge was verified on breastfeeding protection against ovarian and breast cancer (n= 66; 89. 2 %), child development and promotion of mother and <b>baby</b> <b>bonds</b> (n= 74; the 100 %) and protection against child infections (n= 73; 98. 6 %) among postpartum women with eight schooling years. The largest number of prenatal consultations positively influenced the understanding of maternal milk as an optimum food for children (n= 109; 100 %), the baby's bottle use to worsen breast suckling (n= 88; 80. 7 %), the introduction of other foods affecting the child health (n= 93; 85. 3 %) and painless breastfeeding of mothers who follow correct handling (n= 74; 67. 9 %). Conclusion: The study reveals that factors such as instruction and number of prenatal consultations influence the knowledge level on breastfeeding, therefore reinforces the need for prenatal care promotion and educative approaches toward breastfeeding. Relevance for the clinical practice: This study brings to attention factors related to mother’s knowledge about breastfeeding. Thus, women awareness must be raised toward exclusive breastfeeding as the best health practice to the mother-baby binomial...|$|R
40|$|Health {{research}} has identified maternal-foetal bonding {{as a significant}} antecedent of post-natal bonding between mother and <b>baby.</b> Maternal-foetal <b>bonding</b> {{is associated with the}} emotional and cognitive aspects that allow the foetus to be recreated as another human being. This bond is expressed in health practices aimed at the protection and welfare of the foetus. It has been observed that the psychological state of the mother affects the foetus at the neurobehavioral level and influences the appearance of developmental disorders that also manifest in the post-natal period, thereby significantly affecting the mother-baby relationship. Thus, early intervention practices could be extended to the prenatal period as a prevention strategy to favourably impact the health of the child and mother. To address this issue, we present an interdisciplinary intervention model, which focuses on maternal-foetal bonding as a protective factor for bonding during the postnatal period, and as an enhancer of positive parenting practices that promote healthy psychological development...|$|R
5000|$|Honduras was one {{of three}} Central American {{countries}} to exhibit at the exposition. While their display was modest in comparison to others, their exhibit was highlighted by a personal visit to the exposition by Honduran President Luis Bográn. During this visit Bográn's host was Burke. Bográn was impressed by Burke's personality. The two became fast friends. Bográn was looking for someone to market the wealth of natural resources Honduras had to offer the world. Burke envisioned New Orleans as being the primary importing port for all of Central America's exports. In 1886 as an inducement to Burke, Bográn offered two large mining concessions along the Jalán and Guayape rivers in return for Burke's promise to help build an industrial school in Tegucigalpa, Honduras' capital city. Burke accepted and visited Honduras at least twice between 1886 and 1888. In 1888 a reform-minded opposition succeeded in defeating Burke. The time Burke had used in connection with his position as state treasurer was now applied to develop his mining ventures. In 1889 Burke undertook a trip to London to secure financing for a modern mining operation. While in London his successor, William Henry Pipes, discovered significant discrepancies in amount of funds available in the state treasury. Burke was considered a primary suspect of this embezzlement. From London, Burke denied these allegations and stated he intended to return to New Orleans to confront his accusers. After reviewing the evidence on hand, a grand jury handed down nineteen indictments against Burke. The evidence indicated that Burke had failed to destroy state bonds which had been redeemed and issued additional <b>baby</b> <b>bonds</b> without authorization. [...] Sources place the amount of missing treasury funds anywhere from $64,000 to $2 million. [...] In early December, Burke decided not to return to New Orleans and was later personally welcomed by President Bográn to Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Burke did not come empty-handed; he had succeeded in acquiring financing of $8 million for his mining venture. Arresting Burke was not an issue, because Honduras had not yet formalized a set of extradition treaties with the U.S.|$|R
