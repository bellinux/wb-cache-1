5|$|Besides similar fonts, many {{signs and}} objects made in Britain {{during the period}} of Gill Sans' dominance, such as the famous Keep Calm and Carry On poster, {{received}} hand-painted or custom lettering similar to Gill Sans. Fighter Command during the war used a standard set of letters similar to it. Matthew Carter, later a prominent font designer, recalled in 2005 that when his mother cut linoleum <b>block</b> <b>letters</b> for him to play with during the Blitz they were based on it.|$|E

25|$|For centuries Jews {{worldwide}} {{spoke the}} local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to, often developing distinctive dialectal forms or branching off as independent languages. The usual course of development for these languages {{was through the}} addition of Hebrew words and phrases used to express uniquely Jewish concepts and concerns. Often they were written in Hebrew letters, including the <b>block</b> <b>letters</b> used in Hebrew today and Rashi script.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1950s OCS {{lasted for}} 16 weeks. The first 8 weeks most {{candidates}} wore enlisted uniforms. College graduates, recruited directly from civilian life, {{were placed in}} special rate of OCSA (E-2), [...] "officer candidate seaman apprentice". They wore the seaman apprentice rate with <b>blocked</b> <b>letter</b> [...] "OC" [...] over rate insignia, while prior service candidates (referred to as [...] "fleet men") wore their enlisted rate with a <b>blocked</b> <b>letter</b> [...] "OC" [...] over their badge. Chief petty officers wore their CPO uniform, complete with distinctive CPO cap device, and a <b>blocked</b> <b>letter</b> [...] "OC" [...] on left shoulder. Warrant officers (W-1) also continued to wear their uniform, complete with shoulder boards/collar insignia and warrant cap device, with <b>blocked</b> <b>letter</b> [...] "OC" [...] on left shoulder. In final 8 weeks all candidates wore the uniform of a midshipman fourth-class with blocked [...] "OC" [...] letter on left shoulder. They were addressed as officer candidate" [...] and/or [...] "mister". Beginning with Class 38 (APR-AUG 1958) college graduates and fleet sailors were integrated in each company, with all Chief Petty Officers and Warrant Officers (W-1) placed in their own company.|$|R
50|$|Toyland - Children's toys, {{building}} <b>blocks,</b> <b>letter</b> <b>blocks,</b> {{nothing about}} this level can be taken seriously, as is the point for this soft-hearted world.

25|$|Official {{addressing}} protocol is for {{the address}} to be in <b>block</b> <b>letters,</b> using a fixed-pitch typeface (such as Courier). The first line(s) of the address contain(s) the personal name and internal address of the recipient. The second-to-last line is the post office box, general delivery indicator, or street address, using the shortened name of the street type and no punctuation. The last line consists of the legal place name, a single space, the two-letter province abbreviation, two full spaces, and then the postal code. The country designation is unnecessary if mailed within Canada.|$|E
25|$|Since 1933, the one-dollar {{bill has}} been the {{exclusive}} experimental denomination amongst circulating US currency, however, an exception was made in August 1981 for several Richmond $10 notes produced on Natick test paper. The first experiment was conducted in January and February of that year to assess the effects of using different ratios of cotton to linen in the make-up of the bills. Series 1928A and 1928B $1 Silver Certificates with serial number <b>block</b> <b>letters</b> X-B and Y-B were used as the experimental group; the Z-B block {{was used as the}} control group. The results of the experiment were inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{forms of}} the letters in antiquity are {{majuscule}} forms. Besides the upright, straight inscriptional forms (capitals) found in stone carvings or incised pottery, more fluent writing styles adapted for handwriting on soft materials were also developed during antiquity. Such handwriting has been preserved especially from papyrus manuscripts in Egypt since the Hellenistic period. Ancient handwriting developed two distinct styles: uncial writing, with carefully drawn, rounded <b>block</b> <b>letters</b> of about equal size, used as a book hand for carefully produced literary and religious manuscripts, and cursive writing, used for everyday purposes. The cursive forms approached the style of lowercase letter forms, with ascenders and descenders, {{as well as many}} connecting lines and ligatures between letters.|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} relates three {{forms of}} resolution {{as predictors of}} recognition and identification of objects that could be of interest in a military photo-reconaissance situation. Of the three forms of resolution, two are based on existing types of resolution target currently used for assesment purposes and the third, being evaluated under this experiment, {{is based on a}} <b>Block</b> <b>Letter</b> (alphanumeric) target. The results and conclusions of this experiment will show that at a confidence of 90 %, the <b>Block</b> <b>Letter</b> target provides a significantly better resolution value for the prediction of recognition and identification of the type of objects used in this experiment...|$|R

25|$|Grain {{elevators}} {{in small}} Canadian communities often had {{the name of}} the community painted on two sides of the elevator in large <b>block</b> <b>letters,</b> with {{the name of the}} elevator operator emblazoned on the other two sides. This made identification of the community easier for rail operators (and, incidentally, for lost drivers and pilots). The old community name would often remain on an elevator long after the town had either disappeared or been amalgamated into another community; the grain elevator at Ellerslie, Alberta, remained marked with its old community name until it was demolished, which took place more than twenty years after the village had been annexed by the City of Edmonton.|$|E
25|$|From December 1980 onwards, Kekkonen {{suffered}} from an undisclosed disease {{that appeared to}} affect his brain functions, sometimes leading to delusional thoughts. He had begun to suffer occasional brief memory lapses {{as early as the}} autumn of 1972; they became more frequent during the late 1970s. Around the same time, Kekkonen's eyesight deteriorated so much that for his last few years in office, all of his official papers had to be typed in <b>block</b> <b>letters.</b> Kekkonen had also {{suffered from}} a failing sense of balance since the mid-1970s and from enlargement of his prostate gland since 1974. He was also subject to occasional violent headaches and suffered from diabetes from the autumn of 1979.|$|E

500|$|In {{the initial}} {{years after its}} completion, the tram was unpopular with some living {{underneath}} its route. In April 2007, homeowner Justin Auld, living under the tram route, placed a sign on his roof stating [...] "FUCK THE TRAM" [...] in large <b>block</b> <b>letters.</b> The sign is not visible from the street, only from the air. [...] The publicity surrounding the sign prompted city officials to quietly negotiate with the homeowner, and the sign has since been moved and the expletive covered.|$|E
500|$|Two sold-out solo {{acoustic}} concerts at Hollywood's Henry Fonda Theater, on January 31 and February 1, 2003, saw Smith {{attempting to}} reestablish his {{credibility as a}} live performer. Before the show, Smith scrawled [...] "Kali– The Destroyer" [...] (the Hindu goddess associated with time and change) in large <b>block</b> <b>letters</b> with permanent ink on his left arm, which was visible to the crowd during the performance. On several songs, he was backed by a stripped-down drum kit played by Robin Peringer (of the band 764-HERO), and on one track, members of opening band Rilo Kiley contributed backing vocals. Smith then played two more live shows in his adopted hometown: three months later at The Derby and once at the L.A. Weekly Music Awards in June.|$|E
500|$|The titling {{capitals of}} Gill Sans were first {{unveiled}} at a printing conference in 1928; {{it was also}} shown in a specimen issued in the Fleuron magazine edited by Morison. While initial response was partly appreciative, it was still considered dubious by some ultra-conservative printers who saw all sans-serif type as modern and unsound; one called it [...] "typographical Bolshevism". Sans-serifs were still regarded as vulgar and commercial by purists in this period: Johnston's pupil Graily Hewitt privately commented of them that: In Johnston I have lost confidence. Despite all he did for us... he has undone too much by forsaking his standard of the Roman alphabet, giving the world, without safeguard or explanation, his <b>block</b> <b>letters</b> which disfigure our modern life. His prestige has obscured their vulgarity and commercialism. Nonetheless, Gill Sans rapidly became popular after its release.|$|E

500|$|Many scientists, {{including}} Robert Ballard, {{are concerned}} that visits by tourists in submersibles and the recovery of artifacts are causing the wreck to decay faster. Underwater bacteria have been eating away at Titanics steel and transformed it into rust since the ship sank, {{but because of the}} extra damage caused by visitors, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that [...] "the hull and structure of the ship may collapse to the ocean floor within the next 50years." [...] The promenade deck has deteriorated significantly in recent years, partly because of damage caused by submersibles landing on the ship. The mast has almost completely deteriorated and has been stripped of its bell and brass light. Other damage includes a gash on the bow section where <b>block</b> <b>letters</b> once spelled Titanic, part of the brass telemotor which once held the ship's wooden wheel is now twisted and the crow's nest has completely deteriorated. The Canadian director James Cameron is responsible for some of the more significant damage during his expedition to the ship in 1995 to acquire footage for his film Titanic two years later. One of the MIR submersibles used on the expedition collided with the hull, damaging both and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. Captain Smith's quarters were heavily damaged by the collapse of the external bulkhead, which exposed the cabin's interior.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Friday the 13th {{was produced}} {{and directed by}} Sean S. Cunningham, who had previously worked with filmmaker Wes Craven on The Last House on the Left (1972). Cunningham, inspired {{by the success of}} John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), wanted Friday the 13th to be shocking, visually stunning, and [...] " [...] you jump out of your seat". Distancing himself from The Last House on the Left, Cunningham wanted Friday the 13th {{to be more of a}} [...] "roller coaster ride". The first film was meant to be [...] "a real scary movie", and at the same time make audiences laugh. The concept for Friday the 13th began as nothing more than a title. A Long Night at Camp Blood was the working title Victor Miller used while he drafted a script, but Cunningham believed in his [...] "Friday the 13th" [...] moniker and rushed to place an advertisement in International Variety. Worrying that someone else owned the rights to the title and wanting to avoid potential lawsuits, Cunningham thought it would be best to find out immediately. Cunningham commissioned a New York advertising agency to develop his visual concept of the Friday the 13th logo, which consisted of big <b>block</b> <b>letters</b> bursting through a pane of glass. In the end, Cunningham believed there were [...] "no problems" [...] with the title, but distributor George Mansour contends that there was an issue: [...] "There was a movie before ours called Friday the 13th: The Orphan. Moderately successful. But someone still threatened to sue. I don't know whether Phil [...] paid them off, but it was finally resolved." ...|$|E
