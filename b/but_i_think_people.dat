The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E

And I don't really believe those polls. I travel around the country, I see people, I see their response to my husband, I see their response to me. There {{are a lot of}} difficult challenges right now in the United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early reports {{indicated}} that the album had a working title of Bleedthrough.

2500|$|Not all {{critics were}} positive, however. The French {{magazine}} Metallian said {{the album was}} [...] "boring and uneventful" [...] and gave it 1/10.

2500|$|... "One of {{the biggest}} things that I wanted to do on this album was make people realize why {{they fell in love}} with me {{in the first place and}} then take them on a journey to where I am now musically. My ear is {{different}} <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> will recognize me. I think you'll hear that I'm in a happy place. I miss my music.

I think a lot of us want {{to do everything we can}} to prevent tragedies like that from happening again. You know - it's an open society. And when somebody does what he wants to do - it's going to be hard to prevent anything. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> are going to have to take steps in their own lives to take precautions.

2500|$|When {{asked by}} Beck for his opinion on [...] "Muslim extremists", Ellison replied, [...] "They're {{criminal}}s. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>people</b> who commit criminal acts {{should be treated}} like criminals, regardless of their faith."

God put us maybe in this situation for something. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> who know me, people who have had the chance to be with me on the same team, know what kind of person I am.

60|$|This was {{an extreme}} case, and perhaps such a venture might not always turn out so happily; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>people</b> might oftener trust {{themselves}} to Providence {{in these matters}} than they do.

5000|$|Sheehan {{was known}} as an outspoken politician, on the right-wing of his party. In 1997, he {{introduced}} a private member's {{bill that would have}} repealed the Rand formula.

[...] It features vocals from American singer Mike Posner. Posner commented in an interview for Digital Spy about the collaboration:"It was a great record. I think if it does get released, I think it could {{have the same kind of}} success. Max Martin and Cher did a really strong song. During my time with Cher I worked with an incredible singer, and I don't think she gets enough credit for her singing ability as she deserves. There's no autotune on there. It's just really, really great, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> forget about that because she can rap so well also. I don't see why she couldn't compete in the US. She's a great artist." ...|$|E

I was going to write this song about Korn. I don’t know, it wasn’t as funny when I {{directed}} it at somebody. So I thought I would write it not directed to anybody.

5000|$|The {{proof that}} we are far behind on this issue and that racism exists in Brazil is {{precisely}} this whole discussion still exists. Today, more than 15 years ago, people are embarrassed and feel out of common sense when viewing intolerant. We see fewer people extolling and filling her mouth to be intolerant, because today racism is a crime, because society is more flexible toward homosexuals. Example is that when congressman Jair Bolsonaro was speaking what he thinks, he received {{an answer to the}} height of public opinion. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> now it is very clear that it is not cool to be intolerant, <b>but</b> otherwise <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> still have not resolved this internally.
