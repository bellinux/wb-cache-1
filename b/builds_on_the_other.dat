40|$|This paper {{considers}} dyadic-exchange {{networks in}} which individual agents autonomously form coalitions of size two and {{agree on how}} to split a transferable utility. Valid results for this game include stable (if agents have no unilateral incentive to deviate), balanced (if matched agents obtain similar benefits from collaborating), or Nash (both stable and balanced) outcomes. We design provably-correct continuous-time algorithms to find each of these classes of outcomes in a distributed way. Our algorithmic design to find Nash bargaining solutions <b>builds</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two algorithms by having the dynamics for finding stable outcomes feeding into the one for finding balanced ones. Our technical approach to establish convergence and robustness combines notions and tools from optimization, graph theory, nonsmooth analysis, and Lyapunov stability theory and provides a useful framework for further extensions.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to single out what characterises {{productive}} interactions in ICTsupported communities of learners, based on research from three different case studies. The methodological approach through action research reflects my own learning processes as a teacher {{as well as a}} researcher (McNiff, 2002). The thesis {{is based on the assumption}} that when teachers are designing and guiding learning communities there are some common features across age-groups. Common for the three communities is that educational technology is supposed to serve as a space for collaborative writing activities. The study is conducted during a period of time from 2001 to 2004. Study 1 is carried out in 2 nd grade in primary school where the students were supposed to write common texts by means of standalone- computers in the class-room. Study 2 concerns the experiences of distance learning student teachers using educational technology to give and receive feedback on written portfolios. Study 3 is based on student teachers’ experiences with implementation of ICT as a tool for written communication for campus students. In 2003 the Norwegian Research Council asked for research on what they called productive interactions defined as learning situations of high quality. Referring to the results from the ICT-supported SLANT project in England they conclude that further research within this field will bring research and practicum many steps further. The thesis is based on a socio-cultural, and situated perspective on learning, assuming that meaning is created in the tension between the learners’ different voices. Further that the computer can serve as an inter-subjective space for productive dialogues or productive interactions given some preconditions that I wanted to investigate. The term community of learners with shared responsibility for learning between teacher and students is essential for the interpretation of the case studies. Three analytical concepts are used for analysing the activities going on within the communities: Inter-subjectivity as having something in common, as a space for respectful disagreement and as human agency. Action research is the methodological approach. Through the parallel learning process; as a researcher and a teacher I have had the following focus: What can I learn for future design of new learning communities? Accordingly, one study <b>builds</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> illustrated through a stepwise analysis. Through fieldwork I have used classroom observation, interviews and observations of oral as well as written communication. There are some general findings across the three communities. Fundamentally, the teacher should have a holistic view on the pedagogy that is going to be conducted. Pedagogy here is to be understood as the interactive process by which students learning is mediated using a range of artefacts for example language and computers. While the teacher meets the learning community with a design of activities and assignments he or she should be aware that for successful shared responsibility to take place the initial meeting seems to be crucial. There must be confidence between students and teacher, and they must work together to create the aims, the activities and the assignments that are going to be shared and solved. Another finding across the three studies is that when students are collaborating by means of the computer the teacher’s position is changed from that in an ordinary class-room. However the students still want the teacher to be present. The challenge is to figure out how? Finally I will present the findings from the three studies separately based on my observations of oral and written collaboration. I observed the students in study 1 in two different writing activities; experience and creative story. I found that if the students did not share basic confidence they developed what I called counteraction or discussional talk. This means that there was no communication at all. Either one student wrote the whole text or none of them wrote at all. Given basic confidence and interaction the conversation was dependant on what kind of assignments the students were given by the teacher. The experience story asked the students to retell what they had done in the workshops. The students were accumulating knowledge and I decided to call this conversation cumulative talk. In the creative story on the other hand the teacher read a thrilling story before she suddenly stopped and asked the students to continue. They were challenged to use their imagination through argument and creativity. I classified this kind of conversation as explorative talk which in this thesis is used as an equivalent to productive interactions or productive dialogue. What I recognized in study 2 was that the same concepts were adequate for the mutual feedback process between the student teachers. If they were asked to retell information regarding what the informative assignments asked for, then they developed cumulative feedback. If on the other hand their personal attitudes and values were challenged, as the creative assignments allowed for, they developed explorative feedback understood as productive dialogue or productive interactions. In study 3 productive interactions is understood as feedback from peers, and participation in asynchronous discussions. The study shows how and why the students experience online reflective dialogues to be qualitatively different from face-to-face collaboration. Due to distance in time and space the productive interactions are significantly different. They get more time, and they find it easier to “form” the other person. Asynchronous discussions are experienced to include more students than face-to-face discussions. Finally they find that by the end of teacher education the closed space with their written texts has grown to a “property chest” they can visit whenever they want to...|$|E

In this case, one might be tempted to say he is the patron who supports the co-operative to acquire land in Harare. Despite the inappropriateness of the piece of land for residential development since it is rocky and hilly the co-operative managed to get the land. Recently in its bid to acquire more land, the co-operative has been the subject of debate between city of Harare Finance and Housing committees <b>on</b> <b>the</b> best possible use for a portion of land in Kuwadzana. According to planning requirements in Zimbabwe as guided by the Regional, Town and Country planning Act, a permit is required before any development or change of use of property is undertaken. A person wanting to carry out any operations or change of use can consult the local authority for guidance. Some applications are subject to the requirements that public notice must be given in respect of them and owners of adjacent properties must be notified. Therefore, in this case it is important that the case be brought to the attention of the public before a decision can be made. This is because the issue relates to a development which could in the opinion of the local planning authority, have an adverse effect or impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> locality of the area in question. However, the truth is that most of these cases are not being brought to the attention of the public and decisions are being made without meaningful public participation.|$|R

40|$|Rapid and {{substantial}} voltage changes {{can occur in}} distribution networks with a high pen- etration of photovoltaic (PV) systems, due to their unpredictable nature. Electronic power inverters are capable of delivering fast reactive power support to maintain customer voltages within operating tolerances and reduce system losses in distribution feeders. While optimization based paradigms have been proposed to control the reactive power output of inverters, these methods typically rely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> presence of an extensive and fast communication infrastructure which is currently not in place and would be expensive to <b>build.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, approaches that utilize completely local data require {{the design of a}} relation between local measurements and inverter output (i. e. a Volt-VAr curve). These relationships are often naively designed and typically do not yield optimal results. In this work, a systematic and data driven approach is presented to determine PV inverter output as a function of locally obtained measurements in a manner that obtains near optimal results. First, a network model and historic information are used to compute globally optimal settings a posteriori for all controllable inverters in the network. Subsequently, a regression approach is used to find a function for each inverter that maps the solely local historical data to an approximation of the globally optimal inverter output. The resulting functions are then employed as decentralized controllers of the inverters and approximate the globally optimal reactive power outputs based on local measurements only. Simulation results on real feeder models demonstrate that this method achieves near optimal results when performing voltage- and capacity-constrained loss minimization and voltage flattening. This method paves the way to an efficient voltage optimization scheme in which legacy control equipment collaborates with existing inverters to facilitate safe operation of distribution networks with higher levels of distributed generation.

40|$|Background. Today {{modern day}} slavery {{is known as}} human {{trafficking}} and is a growing pandemic that is a grave human rights violation. Estimates suggest that 12. 3 million people are working under conditions of force, fraud or coercion. Working toward eradication is a worthy effort; it would free millions of humans from slavery, mostly women and children, as well as uphold basic human rights. One tactic to eradicating human trafficking is to increase identification of victims among those likely to encounter victims of human trafficking. ^ Purpose. This study aims to develop an intervention that improves certain stakeholders 2 ̆ 7 ability, in the health clinic setting, to appropriately identify and report victims of human trafficking to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center. ^ Methods. The Intervention Mapping (IM) process was used by program planners to develop an intervention for health professionals. This methodology is a six step process that guides program planners to develop an intervention. Each step <b>builds</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> through <b>the</b> execution of a needs assessment, {{and the development of}} matrices based on performance objectives and determinants of the targeted health behavior.

The IM process served as a useful protocol for program planners to take an ecological approach as well as incorporate theory and evidence into the intervention. Consultation with key informants, the planning group, adopters, implementers, and individuals responsible for institutionalization also contributed to the practicality and feasibility of the intervention. Program planners believe that this intervention fully meets recommendations set forth in the literature. ^ Conclusions. The intervention mapping methodology enabled program planners to develop an intervention that is appropriate and acceptable to the implementer and the recipients. ...|$|R
