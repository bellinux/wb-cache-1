5|$|The Manhattan District {{accepted}} that {{wages and salaries}} had to be high enough to allow contractors to hire and retain good workers. It generally allowed wages and salaries to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>by</b> contractors as they saw fit, subject to limits imposed by wartime national wage and price controls intended to limit inflation. Salaries above $9,000 had {{to be approved by}} Patterson and Groves.|$|E
5|$|As 30% of the {{upgrading}} cost had to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>by</b> {{the community}} club, several fundraising activities {{were carried out}} for the redevelopment. These activities, which included music concerts, golf tournaments and cyclethons, raised a total of S$6 million. The old club building was demolished in 1997 and construction of the Marine Parade Community Building began the same year. SAL Construction was the project's main contractor. Built {{at a cost of}} S$30 million, the new building was completed in January 2000, and was open to the public on 6 March 2000. It was officially opened by Goh Chok Tong on 28 May 2000.|$|E
5|$|Debt service {{funds are}} used to account for money {{that will be used}} to pay the {{interest}} and principal of long-term debts. Bonds used by a government to finance major construction projects, to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>by</b> tax levies over a period of years, require a debt service fund to account for their repayment. The debts of permanent and proprietary funds are serviced within those funds, rather than by a separate debt service fund.|$|E

Article 63 does not explicitly mention Russian citizens, and therefore {{does not apply to}} them, but only to foreign nationals living in Russia. Article 61 supersedes it for the people holding the Russian citizenship.|$|E
5|$|In July 2016, the new Mayor of London Sadiq Khan {{announced}} the South Circular would {{become part of}} the London Ultra-Low Emission Zone boundary in 2020, meaning a daily charge of £12.50 for cars/vans/motorcycles and £100 for coaches/HGVs/buses, would need to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>by</b> vehicles not meeting key exhaust emission standards.

5|$|The Lowell System {{combined}} large-scale mechanization with {{an attempt}} to improve the stature of its female workforce and workers. A few girls who came with their mothers or older sisters were as young as ten years old, some were middle-aged, but the average age was about 24. Usually hired for contracts of one year (the average stay was about four years), new employees were given assorted tasks as spare hands and paid a fixed daily wage while more experienced loom operators would <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>by</b> the piece. They were paired with more experienced women, who trained them {{in the ways of}} the factory.|$|E
5|$|The duckers of Aylesbury {{would buy}} eggs from the breeders, or <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>by</b> a breeder {{to raise the}} ducks on their behalf, and would raise the ducklings in their homes between November and August as a {{secondary}} source of income. Duckers were typically skilled labourers, who invested surplus income in ducklings. Many of the tasks related to rearing the ducks would {{be carried out by}} the women of the household, particularly the care of newly hatched ducklings.|$|E
5|$|A {{struggle}} over {{the power of the}} purse brought Adams back into the political limelight. Traditionally, the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid the salaries of the governor, lieutenant governor, and superior court judges. From the Whig perspective, this arrangement was an important check on executive power, keeping royally appointed officials accountable to democratically elected representatives. In 1772, Massachusetts learned that those officials would henceforth <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>by</b> the British government rather than by the province. To protest this development, Adams and his colleagues devised a system of committees of correspondence in November 1772; the towns of Massachusetts would consult with each other concerning political matters via messages sent through a network of committees that recorded British activities and protested imperial policies. Committees of correspondence soon formed in other colonies, as well.|$|E

5|$|By the June deadline, Laing {{had made}} a payment of $200,000. GEDCA {{requested}} the outstanding $50,000 along with the $100,000 remaining balance to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>by</b> Laing by the September deadline. When asked by a local talk radio station if the Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon settlement money would be a windfall for GEDCA and {{could be used for}} future economic development projects on Guam, GEDCA administrator Karl Pangelinan stated that the money would barely pay for the legal fees incurred during the years of legal fighting with Laing. In September, Rigel Entertainment declared bankruptcy. On October 26, GEDCA board met and established that Laing {{had made a}} partial late payment of $75,000 on the $150,000 still outstanding. A new deadline was set for January 31, 2013. Laing missed the January deadline, but in late February, GEDCA reported receiving the money, thus bringing the lawsuit to a close.|$|E
5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>by</b> Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able {{to think of themselves as}} equal partners to the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and while it is true that Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.|$|E
5|$|Ernuszt's {{accounts}} of his activity as royal treasurer have been preserved. The accounts cover {{the period between}} 1 February 1494 and 31 December 1495. The document is {{an important source of}} demographic, economic, and cultural research of late medieval Hungary. The accounts contain a detailed record of the one-florin tax assessed in Hungary proper, Transylvania and Slavonia in 1494 and 1495 which was to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>by</b> each peasant household. They do not contain data for the fourteen southern counties in Hungary proper, because the ispán (or head) of Temes County, who was responsible for the defence of the southern border, was entitled to spend the royal income from the one-florin tax assessed in this region. The peasants in southern Slavonia were also exempt from the one-florin tax because of the frequent Ottoman raids in this region.|$|E
