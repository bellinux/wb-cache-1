25|$|I {{have written}} this letter {{to you on}} a happy day to me, {{which is also the}} last day of my life. For I have been {{attacked}} by a painful inability to urinate, and also dysentery, so violent that nothing can be added to the violence of my sufferings. But the cheerfulness of my mind, which comes from the recollection of all my philosophical contemplation, counterbalances all these afflictions. And I <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> {{to take care of the}} children of Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of the devotion shown by the young man to me, and to philosophy.|$|E
25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I {{can assure you that}} you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For the last time I <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E

Pausing for a moment he scribbled on the back of an old tavern bill a note addressed to his wife, Sarah: [...] "I have no time to say more but to <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> will give my duty to the Queen, and let her know her army has had a glorious victory." ...|$|E
500|$|Bennett {{returned}} to London in March 1842, and continued his {{teaching at the}} RAM. The next year the post of professor of music at the University of Edinburgh became vacant. With Mendelssohn's strong encouragement Bennett applied for the position. Mendelssohn wrote to {{the principal of the}} university, [...] "I <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> to use your powerful influence on behalf of that candidate whom I consider in every respect worthy of the place, a true ornament to his art and his country, and indeed one of the best and most highly gifted musicians now living: Mr. Sterndale Bennett." [...] Despite this advocacy Bennett's application was unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|On 20 April 1770, Smart {{was arrested}} for debt. On 11 January 1771, he was tried by Lord Mansfield, the gentleman who {{originally}} introduced Smart to Alexander Pope, and he was soon recommended to the King's Bench Prison. Although he was in prison, Charles Burney purchased the [...] "Rules" [...] (allowing him some freedom), and Smart's final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic. In his final letter, Smart begged for money from Rev. Mr. Jackson, saying: [...] "Being upon recovery from a fit of illness, and having nothing to eat, I <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> to send me two or three shillings which (God willing) I will return, with many thanks, {{in two or three}} days." [...] On 20 May 1771, Smart died from either liver failure or pneumonia shortly after completing his final work, Hymns, for the Amusement of Children.|$|E

500|$|On {{his return}} to St. James's Palace, Churchill's {{attention}} was drawn towards other matters, and to a fresh face at court. [...] "I <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> will let me see you {{as often as you}} can", pleaded Churchill in a letter to Sarah Jennings, [...] "which I am sure you ought to do if you care for my love..." [...] Sarah Jennings' social origins were in many ways similar to Churchill's – minor gentry blighted by debt-induced poverty. After her father's death when she was eight, Sarah, together with her mother and sisters, moved to London. As Royalist supporters (despite the fact that Sarah's great uncle, James Temple, was convicted of regicide), the Jennings' loyalty to the crown, like the Churchill's, was repaid with court employment, and in 1673 Sarah followed her sister Frances into the household of the Duchess of York, Mary of Modena, second wife to James, Duke of York.|$|E
500|$|The GameCube version {{rated the}} lowest among critics {{out of the}} three versions. Ben Kosmina of Nintendo World Report promised that [...] "gamers {{experiencing}} the wacky mascot {{for the first time}} may enjoy it." [...] Michael Lafferty of GameZone described the game as [...] "safe, sterile and redundant." [...] Matt Casamassina on IGN concluded that [...] "at {{the end of the day}} this is the same Crash game I played so many years ago without any real innovations or evolutions." [...] Nintendo Power praised the [...] "sheer variety" [...] of the gameplay. Kilo Watt of GamePro said that [...] "graphically, this version is slightly below the recent Xbox release but in line with the competent PlayStation 2 iteration." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly agreed that [...] "Wrath on the GC is much more polished here than on the PS2," [...] while Play Magazine denounced the GameCube version as [...] "a shell of the other two console versions, so I <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> to pass." ...|$|E
500|$|Philip Tilden, Churchill's architect, {{began work}} on the house in 1922 and the Churchills rented a {{farmhouse}} near Westerham, Churchill frequently visiting the site to observe progress. The two-year building programme, the ever-rising costs, which escalated from the initial estimate of £7,000 to over £18,000, {{and a series of}} construction difficulties, particularly relating to damp, soured relations between architect and client, and by 1924 Churchill and Tilden were barely on speaking terms. Legal arguments, conducted through their respective lawyers, rumbled on until 1927. Clementine's anxieties about the costs, both of building and subsequently living at Chartwell also continued. In September 1923 Churchill wrote to her, [...] "My beloved, I <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> not to worry about money, or to feel insecure. Chartwell is to be our home (and) we must endeavour to live there for many years." [...] Churchill finally moved into the house in April 1924, a letter dated 17 April of that year to Clementine begins, [...] "This is the first letter I have ever written from this place, and it is right that it should be to you".|$|E

500|$|Former Nice {{mayor and}} {{cookbook}} author Jacques Médecin was a strict salad traditionalist. His 1972 cookbook Cuisine Nicoise: Recipes from a Mediterranean Kitchen {{called for the}} salad to be served in a wooden bowl rubbed with garlic, and excluded boiled vegetables: [...] "never, never, I <b>beg</b> <b>you,</b> include boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable in your salade niçoise." [...] Médecin wrote that the salad should be made [...] "predominately of tomatoes" [...] which should be [...] "salted three times and moistened with olive oil". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or canned tuna, [...] but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, green peppers, fava beans, spring onions, black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, Médecin believed that salade niçoise [...] "was {{a product of the}} sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi." [...] Médecin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad, [...] commenting, [...] "As the various ingredients that go into salade niçoise are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl." ...|$|E
500|$|In late January 1567, Mary {{prompted}} {{her husband}} to return to Edinburgh. He recuperated from his illness in a house belonging to the brother of Sir James Balfour at the former abbey of Kirk o' Field, just within the city wall. Mary visited him daily, so that it appeared a reconciliation was in progress. On the night of 9–10 February 1567, Mary visited {{her husband in the}} early evening and then attended the wedding celebrations of a member of her household, Bastian Pagez. In {{the early hours of the}} morning, an explosion devastated Kirk o' Field, and Darnley was found dead in the garden, apparently smothered. There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body. Bothwell, Moray, Secretary Maitland, the Earl of Morton and Mary herself were among those who came under suspicion. Elizabeth wrote to Mary of the rumours, [...] "I should ill fulfil the office of a faithful cousin or an affectionate friend if I did not... tell you what all the world is thinking. Men say that, instead of seizing the murderers, you are looking through your fingers while they escape; that you will not seek revenge on those who have done you so much pleasure, as though the deed would never have taken place had not the doers of it been assured of impunity. For myself, I <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> to believe that I would not harbour such a thought." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{his arrival}} in America, Priestley had {{continued}} to defend his Christian Unitarian beliefs; now, falling increasingly {{under the influence of}} Thomas Cooper and Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley, he was unable to avoid becoming embroiled in political controversy. In 1798, when, in response to the Pinckney affair, a belligerent President Adams sought to enlarge the navy and mobilise the militia into what Priestley and Cooper saw as a 'standing army', Priestley published an anonymous newspaper article: Maxims of political arithmetic, which attacked Adams, defended free trade, and advocated a form of Jeffersonian isolationism. In the same year, a small package, addressed vaguely: [...] "Dr Priestley in America," [...] was seized by the Royal Navy on board a neutral Danish boat. It was found to contain three letters, one of which was signed by the radical printer John Hurford Stone. These intercepted letters were published in London, and copied in numerous papers in America. One of the letters was addressed to [...] "MBP", with a note: [...] "I inclose a note for our friend MBP—but, as ignorant of the name he bears at present among you, I must <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> to seal and address it." [...] This gave the intercepted letters a tinge of intrigue. Fearful lest they be taken as evidence of him being a 'spy in the interest of France', Priestley sent a clumsy letter to numerous newspaper editors, in which he naively named [...] "MBP" [...] (Member of the British Parliament) as Mr. Benjamin Vaughan, who [...] "like me, thought it necessary to leave England, and for some time is said to have assumed a feigned name." [...] William Cobbett, in his Porcupine's Gazette, 20 August 1798, added that Priestley [...] "has told us who Mr MBP is, and has confirmed me in the opinion of their both being spies in the interest of France." ...|$|E
