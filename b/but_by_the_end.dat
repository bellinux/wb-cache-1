5|$|Nadar (1820–1910), {{the son of}} a publisher, had {{previously}} had medical training in Lyon and at Hôtel-Dieu. However, by the late 1830s he had left medicine to focus on the printed press, becoming a caricaturist, journalist, and novelist. He only began photography in 1854, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of that decade he was well known for his portraits of famous persons and advances in photographic techniques.|$|E

5|$|The {{expenditures}} that Caracalla {{made with}} the large bonuses he gave to soldiers prompted him to debase the coinage soon after his ascension. At the end of Severus' reign, and early into Caracalla's, the Roman denarius had an approximate silver purity of around 55%, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his reign the purity {{had been reduced to}} about 51%.|$|E
5|$|While {{the show}} was still in previews, writer Owen Davis claimed the story had been lifted from his earlier play Lola, which had {{appeared}} briefly on Broadway in March 1911, then was adapted as a movie in 1914. He filed a lawsuit, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of May it was settled with a cash payment to Davis.|$|E
5|$|Although Herrerasaurus {{shared the}} body {{shape of the}} large {{carnivorous}} dinosaurs, it lived {{during a time when}} dinosaurs were small and insignificant. It was the time of non-dinosaurian reptiles, not dinosaurs, and a major turning point in the Earth's ecology. The vertebrate fauna of the Ischigualasto Formation and the slightly later Los Colorados Formation consisted mainly of a variety of crurotarsal archosaurs and synapsids. In the Ischigualasto Formation, dinosaurs constituted only about 6% {{of the total number of}} fossils, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the Triassic Period, dinosaurs were becoming the dominant large land animals, and the other archosaurs and synapsids declined in variety and number.|$|E

5|$|Both serials were {{promptly}} {{released on}} iTunes, with DVD releases following {{over the next}} few months. Both on the iTunes and the DVD release, episode 3 of The Web of Fear was represented by a tele-snap reconstruction, edited by John Kelly. Episode 3 {{had been part of the}} same find, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of protracted negotiations for the return of the film cans, the episode had disappeared from the cache, with the presumption that it was sold to a private collector.|$|E
5|$|During David Dacko's {{presidency}} from 1960 to 1966, {{there was}} {{a significant increase in the}} production of diamonds. This occurred when the monopoly of the French concessionary companies was ended with a law allowing local citizens to dig for diamonds. After Dacko set up a diamond cutting factory at Bangui, diamonds became the country's leading export. <b>But</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his five year's tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers being left unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in a military coup in 1966.|$|E
5|$|During the interregnum {{following}} the English Civil War, the Old Blockhouse {{was occupied by}} the Royalists and it was attacked by the Parliamentary forces of Sir Robert Blake in 1651. Blake's naval guns out-ranged those of the fort, and, after fierce fighting, the blockhouse was taken. A battery of guns was maintained at the blockhouse until at least the 1750s, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 18th century the fortification was disused and in ruins.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, Cosby's only {{contract}} was with Jell-O, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> {{of the year}} he had added two more endorsements. By August, Cosby began promoting E. F. Hutton & Co. {{with a series of}} print and television advertisements, and comedy concerts. The company had been accused of fraud and needed a spokesperson who was well-liked. Soon after Cosby's commercials aired, the company merged with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. In late December, he added J. Walter Thompson agency account Kodak Colorwatch System photographic processing system to his list. The estimated $10 million contract included commercials featuring Cosby to run in print, on television, as point of sale, and in promotional programs.|$|E

Mary's first Parliament, which assembled in early October 1553, declared the marriage of her parents valid and abolished Edward's religious laws. Church doctrine was restored to the form it had taken in the 1539 Six Articles, which (among other things) re-affirmed clerical celibacy. Married priests were deprived of their benefices.|$|E
5|$|The Radical Republicans did {{create some}} {{improvement}} within the state. Levees were constructed and railroads were built. Also, Arkansas' first {{public school system}} was created. The administration and its supporters formed the Arkansas Industrial University, {{the basis for the}} future University of Arkansas in Fayetteville; what would become the Arkansas School for the Deaf; and the Arkansas School for the Blind, which relocated from Arkadelphia to Little Rock. However, state debt increased dramatically. The state had a budget surplus when Clayton came to office, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his term, the state debt had increased to $5 million.|$|E
25|$|Distinction {{was made}} in this period between full dress worn at court and for formal {{occasions}}, and undress or everyday, daytime clothes.

50|$|A new church, the Church of the Resurrection, {{was built}} {{next to the}} tower from 1531 to 1543, <b>but</b> already <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> 17th century it was used as bell choir stalls to {{supplement}} the hanging bells, {{rather than as a}} place of worship.|$|R
5|$|The college officially {{opened on}} October 4, 1876 with six professors. Forty{{students}} were {{present on the}} first day of classes, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the school year the number had grown to 106students. Only men were admitted, and all students were required to participate in the Corps of Cadets and receive military training. The campus bore minimal resemblance to its modern counterpart. Wild animals roamed freely around the campus, and the area served as a meeting point for the Great Western Cattle Trail.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome was}} {{unacceptable}} for the rebellious barons, and {{war between the}} two parties broke out almost immediately after the announcement of the settlement. After a victory at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264, Montfort took over control of government, but the success was short-lived. Henry's oldest son Edward – the later King Edward Istarted a military campaign that ended in the Battle of Evesham in August 1265, where Montfort was defeated and killed. Parts of the baronial resistance still held out, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of 1266 the final garrison at Kenilworth Castle surrendered. The rebels were given pardons according to terms set out in the Dictum of Kenilworth.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s, {{germanium}} {{was thought to}} be a poorly conducting metal. Germanium did not become economically significant until after 1945 when its properties as an electronic semiconductor were recognized. During World War II, small amounts of germanium were used in some special electronic devices, mostly diodes. The first major use was the point-contact Schottky diodes for radar pulse detection during the War. The first silicon-germanium alloys were obtained in 1955. Before 1945, only a few hundred kilograms of germanium were produced in smelters each year, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 1950s, the annual worldwide production had reached 40 metric tons.|$|E

50|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century missionaries pushed through African jungles and deserts, learned local languages, and braved pestilential climates to create schools, hospitals, and churches. Some were killed, others {{contracted}} debilitating diseases, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> century's <b>end</b> a global missionary presence was in place. Disease and martyrdom claimed great numbers.|$|R
5|$|Where {{it lives}} {{alongside}} the blue wildebeest, {{the two species}} can hybridise, and this {{is regarded as a}} potential threat to the maintenance of the species. The black wildebeest was once very numerous and was present in southern Africa in vast herds <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the nineteenth century, it had nearly been hunted to extinction and fewer than 600 animals remained. A small number of individuals was still present in game reserves and at zoos and it is from these that the population was rescued.|$|E
5|$|While Galileo's {{application}} of mathematics to experimental physics was innovative, his mathematical methods were the standard ones of the day, including dozens {{of examples of}} an inverse proportion square root method passed down from Fibonacci and Archimedes. The analysis and proofs relied heavily on the Eudoxian theory of proportion, as {{set forth in the}} fifth book of Euclid's Elements. This theory had become available only a century before, thanks to accurate translations by Tartaglia and others; <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of Galileo's life, it was being superseded by the algebraic methods of Descartes.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{start to}} the season saw Arsenal top the league table after four matches. The team's draw at Manchester United in September marked an unsavoury episode between both clubs: several Arsenal players were charged and fined {{accordingly}} by The Football Association for their part in a mass brawl that occurred after the match. In November, Arsenal beat Dynamo Kyiv by a single goal and more impressively scored five against Inter Milan at the San Siro – two results which kick-started their Champions League campaign. At {{the turn of the}} year, the team won nine league matches in a row to consolidate first position. In the first week of April, they were eliminated from the FA Cup and Champions League, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the month had secured their status as league champions, with a 2–2 draw against local rivals Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
