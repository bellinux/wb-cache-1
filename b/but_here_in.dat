Calfhow Pike would have little significance in more rugged areas of the Lake District, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the midst of smooth green slopes it is a conspicuous landmark visible for miles around.

2500|$|The Mishnah (following [...] ) {{taught that}} a sin-offering {{of a bird}} preceded a burnt-offering of a bird; and the priest also {{dedicated}} them in that order. Rabbi Eliezer taught that wherever an offerer (because of poverty) substituted for an animal sin-offering the offering of two birds (one of which was for a sin-offering {{and the other for}} a burnt-offering), the priest sacrificed the bird sin-offering before the bird burnt-offering (as [...] instructs). But {{in the case of a}} woman after childbirth discussed in [...] (where a poor new mother could substitute for an animal burnt-offering two birds, one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering), the bird burnt-offering took precedence over the bird sin-offering. Wherever the offering came on account of sin, the sin-offering took precedence. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> (<b>in</b> the case of a woman after childbirth, where the sin-offering was not on account of sin) the burnt-offering took precedence. And wherever both birds came instead of one animal sin-offering, the sin-offering took precedence. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> (<b>in</b> the case of a woman after childbirth) they did not both come on account of a sin-offering (for in poverty she substituted a bird burnt-offering for an animal burnt-offering, as [...] required her to bring a bird sin-offering in any case), the burnt-offering took precedence. (The Gemara asked whether this contradicted the Mishnah, which taught that a bird sin-offering took precedence over an animal burnt-offering, whereas here she brought the animal burnt-offering before the bird sin-offering.) Rava taught that [...] merely accorded the bird burnt-offering precedence in the mentioning. (Thus, some read Rava to teach that [...] lets the reader read first about the burnt-offering, but in fact the priest sacrificed the sin-offering first. Others read Rava to teach that one first dedicated the animal or bird for the burnt-offering and then dedicated the bird for the sin-offering, but in fact the priest sacrificed the sin-offering first.) ...|$|E

[...] Allow me to explain. In every way, the carnival has been a joyful celebration of the soul of the people, an exhibition of good artistic taste, a competition of original ideas, a contest in which thought and action have always vied in giving objective form to the perfect conception of Beauty and towards the noble intent of the dignification of society; Paris, Rome, Venice, Madrid and Havana itself offer in their carnestolendas lessons on how complaisant liberty ought to be used in those periods of fantasy in order to educate the wishes and aspirations of the citizen. <b>But</b> <b>here,</b> <b>in</b> our city, in one of those scientifically inexplicable regressions towards a dark past, certain elements of our commonwealth seem committed [...] under the pretext of carnaval [...] to the repugnant task of checking human progress and causing harm to Civilization with their excesses.|$|E
