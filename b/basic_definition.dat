They evolve from general human rights, in particular: non-discrimination, freedom of expression, right to private life, and the right of members of a linguistic minority to use their language with other members of their community.|$|E

25|$|Given this <b>basic</b> <b>definition,</b> further {{criteria}} {{are needed to}} establish a dividing line between postlexical clitics and morphological affixes, since both are characterized {{by a lack of}} prosodic autonomy. There is no natural, clear-cut boundary between the two categories (since from a historical point of view, a given form can move gradually {{from one to the other}} by morphologization). However, by identifying clusters of observable properties that are associated with core examples of clitics on the one hand, and core examples of affixes on the other, one can pick out a battery of tests that provide an empirical foundation for a clitic/affix distinction.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{broadest}} and {{most widely used}} sense, an introduced species is synonymous with non-native and therefore applies as well to most garden and farm organisms; these adequately fit the <b>basic</b> <b>definition</b> given above. However, some sources add to that <b>basic</b> <b>definition</b> [...] "and are now reproducing in the wild", which removes from consideration as introduced species that were raised or grown in gardens or farms that do not survive without tending by people. With respect to plants, these latter are in this case defined as either ornamental or cultivated plants.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>definition</b> of {{metropolitan}} areas has had slight changes made {{to it as}} well. [...] A metropolitan area, {{as it did in}} 1990, requires a Census Bureau-defined urbanized area of at least 50,000 people. [...] A metropolitan statistical area containing an urbanized area of at least 2.5 million people can be subdivided into two or more [...] "metropolitan divisions," [...] provided specified criteria are met. [...] Metropolitan divisions are conceptually similar to the primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) defined under previous standards.|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "peek" [...] {{is similar}} to the basic [...] "push" [...] and [...] "pop" [...] {{operations}} on a stack, but the name for this operation varies depending on data type and language. Peek is generally considered an inessential operation, compared with the more basic operations of adding and removing data, and as such is not included in the <b>basic</b> <b>definition</b> of these data types. However, since it is a useful operation and generally easily implemented, it is frequently included in practice, and in some definitions peek is included as basic, with pop (or analog) defined in terms of peek; see abstract definition.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{there not}} being much {{change in the}} <b>basic</b> <b>definition,</b> 49 new {{metropolitan}} areas were formed {{as a result of}} the new rules for them. [...] Over 550 other areas were classified as micropolitan. [...] All told, the present rules have defined 935 CBSAs in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. [...] 11 of the CBSAs have metropolitan divisions, 29 in total. [...] In comparison, the definition of metropolitan areas in 1999, the last year areas were formed based on the 1990 rules for them, there were 284 metropolitan areas, with 19 of the areas providing 76 primary metropolitan areas (the equivalent of divisions); almost three times the number of areas overall are now recognized by the OMB.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars have {{difficulty}} defining which ancient Egyptian beliefs are myths. The <b>basic</b> <b>definition</b> of myth {{suggested by the}} Egyptologist John Baines is [...] "a sacred or culturally central narrative". In Egypt, the narratives that are central to culture and religion are almost entirely about events among the gods. Actual narratives about the gods' actions are rare in Egyptian texts, particularly from early periods, and most references to such events are mere mentions or allusions. Some Egyptologists, like Baines, argue that narratives complete enough to be called [...] "myths" [...] existed in all periods, but that Egyptian tradition did not favor writing them down. Others, like Jan Assmann, have said that true myths were rare in Egypt and may only have emerged partway through its history, developing out of the fragments of narration that appear in the earliest writings. Recently, however, Vincent Arieh Tobin and Susanne Bickel have suggested that lengthy narration was not needed in Egyptian mythology because of its complex and flexible nature. Tobin argues that narrative is even alien to myth, because narratives tend to form a simple and fixed perspective on the events they describe. If narration is not needed for myth, any statement that conveys an idea about the nature or actions of a god can be called [...] "mythic".|$|E
