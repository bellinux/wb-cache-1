5|$|In August 2007, a U.S. {{federal judge}} {{approved}} the French government's request to extradite Noriega to France after his release. Noriega appealed his extradition because he claimed France would not honor his legal {{status as a}} prisoner of war. In 1999, the Panamanian government sought the extradition of Noriega to face murder charges in Panama because he had <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>guilty</b> in absentia in 1995 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.|$|E
5|$|Roderigo Lopez (also called Ruy Lopes, Ruy Lopez or Roger Lopez; c. 1517 – 7 June 1594) {{served as}} physician-in-chief to Queen Elizabeth I of England from 1581 {{until his death}} by execution, having <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>guilty</b> of {{plotting}} to poison her. A Portuguese converso or New Christian of Jewish ancestry, {{he is the only}} royal doctor in English history to have been executed, and may have inspired the character of Shylock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, which was written within four years of his death.|$|E

5|$|Momolo Mortara died in 1871, {{shortly after}} {{spending}} seven {{months in prison}} during his trial {{over the death of}} a servant girl who had fallen from the window of his apartment. He had <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>guilty</b> of murdering her by the Florentine court of appeal, but then acquitted by the court of assizes. Pope Pius IX died in 1878. The same year Marianna travelled to Perpignan in south-western France, where she had heard Edgardo was preaching, and enjoyed an emotional reunion with her son, who was pleased to see her, but disappointed when she refused his pleas to convert to Catholicism. Edgardo thereafter attempted to re-establish connections with his family, but not all of his relatives were as receptive to him as his mother.|$|E
5|$|No {{conclusive}} proof of wrongdoing {{has come to}} light, though other aspects of Norris's financial dealings unrelated to the promotion controversy have fuelled speculation on the matter; Norris resigned as chairman and left the club in 1929, having <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>guilty</b> by the Football Association of financial irregularities; he {{was found to have}} misused his expenses account, and to have pocketed the proceeds of the sale of the Arsenal team bus. Regardless of the circumstances of their promotion in 1919, Arsenal have remained in the top division since then, and as a result hold the English record for the longest unbroken stretch of top-flight football.|$|E
5|$|On December 13, 2006, one of Ono's bodyguards {{was arrested}} {{after he was}} {{allegedly}} taped trying to extort $2million from her. The tapes revealed that he threatened to release private conversations and photographs. His bail was revoked, and he {{pleaded not guilty to}} two counts of attempted grand larceny. In February 16, 2007 a deal was reached where extortion charges were dropped, and he pleaded guilty to attempted grand larceny in the third degree, a felony, and was sentenced to the 60 days that he had already spent in jail. After reading an unapologetic statement, he was released to immigration officials because he had also <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>guilty</b> of overstaying his business visa.|$|E

5|$|There {{appear to}} be no extant records of the {{meetings}} which elected Arsenal to the First Division in 1919, however the book Making the Arsenal proposes a different reason for their election in that year. The site argues that the match fixing issues of {{the final year of}} football before the war (1914–15) were used by Norris as a weapon in his battle to get Arsenal promoted. He demanded that Liverpool and Manchester United (some of who's players had <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>guilty</b> of match fixing) be punished by relegation or expulsion, and threatened to organise a breakaway from the league by Midlands and southern clubs if nothing was done. To placate him the League offered Arsenal a place in the First Division.|$|E
5|$|Another event which {{attracted}} {{much debate}} was the Supreme Court's annulment of the 1946 war crimes conviction of Gregorij Rožman. Rožman was the Catholic bishop of Ljubljana who had <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>guilty</b> {{of war crimes}} and treason during World War II {{as a result of}} his collaboration with Italian and German occupation forces. Several attempts during the 1990s to review the trial had failed. This had led to Janša's government changing the law, enabling the religious communities to request a review of trials of their deceased members, something which had previously been reserved only for close relatives. After the Archdiocese of Ljubljana initiated the review, the Supreme Court annulled the 1946 trial on procedural grounds, effectively rehabilitating Rožman, a decision that caused much controversy. This proved harmful for Peterle's campaign, as he was closely associated with the Catholic Church. When asked about the Rožman case in a TV debate, Peterle confined himself to remarking that he was a supporter of the rule of law, that the war had divided the nation and that Rožman had played some part in that.|$|E
5|$|During the Kingdom, the Senate {{consisted}} of persons selected {{to the position}} by the King, a power which the consuls inherited {{after the end of}} the monarchy. In the very early republic, senators were primarily chosen due to their birth, but by the late Republic, and especially after Sulla, membership in the Senate became predicated on having previously held a magistracy. In the late 4th century BC, the consul's power to control Senate membership was transferred to the censor, exercised with considerable discretion, until laws passed in the late Republic formalised some kind of hearing before censorial decisions. In line with the censor's duty to protect morals, senators were required to be of good character, not have <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>guilty</b> of a criminal offence, and not be a person tainted with ignominy (e.g. bankrupts, former gladiators, prostitutes, or deserters). Before the time of Augustus, there is no evidence of any kind of property qualification. The Senate {{consisted of}} around 300 prior to the dictatorship of Sulla, but after his dictatorship, it consisted of somewhere over 500 men.|$|E
50|$|The Bill {{for this}} Act {{said that it}} was {{expected}} to result in about two hundred prosecutions a year. In 1998, there were nearly six thousand prosecutions. A written question, raised by a Member of Parliament in 2008 and relating to prosecutions under section 2 from the date of the Act to 2006, showed the numbers of persons proceeded against under section 2 remained fairly steady during the period (5,540 in 1999 of whom 2,753 <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>guilty,</b> 5,446 in 2006 of whom 3,768 <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>guilty).</b> A 2011 written question requesting information about prosecutions under section 2 during the period 2006-2009 showed 5,006 persons proceeded against during 2006-7 of whom 3,543 <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>guilty,</b> 4,940 proceeded against during 2007-8 of whom 3,650 <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>guilty</b> and 4,865 proceeded against during 2008-9 of whom 3,892 <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>guilty.</b>|$|R
