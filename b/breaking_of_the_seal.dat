50|$|The Dragoons, {{like their}} Peacemakers counterparts, {{do not feel}} many human emotions, such as fear and sadness, or see {{anything}} wrong in sacrificing many humans to protect the Providence Breaker.

25|$|In warm, damp climates, H. aspersa may {{lay eggs}} {{as often as}} five times from February through October, {{depending}} on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when {{there are at least}} 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days to <b>break</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sealed</b> nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, H. aspersa matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, H. aspersa hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season will reach adult size and form a lip at <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early hatchlings, the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some H. aspersa mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of H. aspersa's reproductive activity takes place in <b>the</b> second year <b>of</b> its life.|$|R

6000|$|As Peter Baron {{held his}} discoveries {{successively}} {{in his hands}} he became conscious of a queer emotion which was not altogether elation and yet was still less pure pain. He had made a find, but it somehow added to his responsibility; he was in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> something interesting, but (in a manner he couldn't have defined) this circumstance suddenly constituted a danger. It was <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> danger, for instance, which caused to remain in abeyance any impulse he might have felt to <b>break</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals.</b> He looked at them all narrowly, but he {{was careful not to}} loosen them, and he wondered uncomfortably whether <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secret compartment would be held in equity to be <b>the</b> property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people in the King's Road.

He paid by a growing consciousness that a nameless chill had stolen into the air the penalty, which he had many a time paid before, of being made of sensitive stuff. It was as if an occasion had insidiously arisen for a sacrifice--a sacrifice for <b>the</b> sake <b>of</b> a fine superstition, something like honour or kindness or justice, something indeed perhaps even finer still--a difficult deciphering of duty, an impossible tantalising wisdom. Standing there before his ambiguous treasure and losing himself for the moment in <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> a dawning complication, he was startled by a light, quick tap at <b>the</b> door <b>of</b> his sitting-room.

The relationship between Sam and Dean is strained. Sam starts siding with Ruby over Dean. He begins to give into his demonic side by drinking demon blood to become strong enough to defeat Lilith. He and Dean eventually have a falling-out. Sam sides fully with Ruby in his obsessive quest to kill Lilith.

Used by Madara {{in his attempt to}} wipe out Konohagakure at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> its foundation, Kurama is defeated and sealed within Hashirama's wife and then transferred to Kushina Uzumaki two generations later. Through Obito's scheme, Kurama is released and attacks Konohagakure before being stopped by the Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze, who <b>seals</b> <b>the</b> fox's Yin half within himself. Following this, Minato and Kushina sacrifice themselves to <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> weakened Yang Kurama within their son, Naruto Uzumaki, twelve years before the series' start. Throughout the series, Naruto tries to harness Kurama's immense chakra to perform several jutsu that would normally be impossible for a shinobi of his age. But Naruto soon learns that relying too much on Kurama's power would allow the fox to impose its will over its host to <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>seal.</b> Naruto eventually takes control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fox's chakra with help from an imprint of Kushina. During Naruto's fight against Obito, seeing its host's resolve to save the other Tailed Beasts, Kurama befriends Naruto by allowing him to achieve Tailed Beast Mode. Eventually, after being extracted with Yin Kurama was transferred from Minato into Naruto, Kurama becomes whole after returning to its Jinchuriki's body and reuniting with its Yin counterpart.

40|$|A few {{components}} {{belonging to}} an aeroengine {{were sent to}} the laboratory for investigation. Evidences suggested that the primary failure in the engine was in the inter-rotor bearing. The damages seen on <b>the</b> other components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine were secondary in nature and they appeared to have occurred subsequent to the primary failure in the inter-rotor bearing. It is believed that the failure in the bearing was responsible for vibration and wobbling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LP/HP spools. This had led to secondary damages in various other components such as <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graphite <b>sealing</b> rings, dislodgement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graphite <b>sealing</b> rings holding nut, etc. This in turn, led to loss of lubrication oil in the bearing. The bearing had then run under lubrication starvation condition until stop. During this time, the damages in the bearing were severe and this had led to temperature generation in excess of 8000 C. Finally, when the rotors stopped, the LP/HP spools were under complete seizure. Due to the damages that took place after initiation of vibration and wobbling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spools, <b>the</b> primary signatures <b>of</b> failure in <b>the</b> bearing were largely obliterated. However, from the gross evidences that were present on <b>the</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failed bearing, it is considered probable that the failure was progressive in nature and spalling on <b>the</b> rolling surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bearing elements appears to have been <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> failure. Since this mechanism of failure could not be unambiguously established from the evidences available on the failed bearing, an inter-rotor bearing of another engine (No. 30109610400059) which was rejected due to excessive vibration was subjected to detailed examination. Study revealed that there was initiation of spalling on all rolling surfaces of this bearing. In view of this finding and <b>the</b> repetitive nature <b>of</b> failure in <b>the</b> inter-rotor bearing <b>of</b> an engines, spalling is considered being the most probable failure mechanism in <b>the</b> bearing <b>of</b> engine No. 301020300052. Spalling in a bearing can occur due to various reasons, among which the deficiency in <b>the</b> material <b>of</b> construction in this case was ruled out from the laboratory test results. Evidences did not show any assembly related problems as well. However, analysis indicated that spalling was most probably associated with lubrication related issues. Although the information available with this laboratory was insufficient for establishing the exact problem, the possible causes that could give rise to spalling in the present bearing have been discussed in detail. A few of these possible causes could be eliminated based on the laboratory findings and the rest needs further evaluation. Also, a few recommendations have been suggested for narrowing down the probable causes. After the evaluation, if it is found that there are no lubrication related issues, it is suggested that the total technical life (TTL) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bearing with the present design and prevalent operating conditions be reevaluated...|$|R
