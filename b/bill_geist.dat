50|$|The Final Four of Everything is a 2007 {{book written}} by Mark Reiter and Richard Sandomir {{on the subject}} of bracketology. Bracketology is the process of {{predicting}} the field of the NCAA Basketball Tournament, named as such because it is commonly used to fill in tournament brackets for the postseason. The book was featured in one of <b>Bill</b> <b>Geist's</b> segments on CBS News Sunday Morning in March 2008, shortly after the book came out. In the segment, Geist interviewed Sandomir (CBS also owns the book's publisher Simon & Schuster).|$|R

Michael Geist ran a series on 61 possible reforms to Bill C-61 that would make it more palatable. In addition, the magazine ComputerWorld Canada ran its own petition drive, asking the government to amend the bill because it discourages experts and other coders from conducting innovative research.|$|R

5000|$|The {{bill would}} have criminalized the act of circumventing, or making {{available}} to the public the ability to circumvent, digital rights management software locks. These restrictions were described as [...] "arguably worse than those found in the U.S." [...] While explicit mentions of [...] "videocassettes" [...] in Bill C-61 were replaced with technology neutral terms, the copying of DRM encumbered media such as DVDs was still prohibited by Bill C-32. Bill C-32 was also interpreted as banning the user of region-free DVD players. According to CBC News, the {{bill would have}} even criminalized [...] "websites designed to encourage violation and piracy". When describing the main principle of the <b>bill,</b> Michael <b>Geist</b> said [...] "anytime a digital lock is used - whether on books, movies, music, or electronic devices - the lock trumps virtually all other rights." ...|$|R

5000|$|Notably, Sunday Morning {{includes}} significant {{coverage of}} the fine and performing arts, including coverage of topics usually not covered in network news, such as architecture, painting, ballet, opera and classical music, though increasingly more popular forms of music have been included as well. The program's correspondents tend to ask nontraditional questions of guests (for instance, actor Brad Pitt was asked about his love of architecture, and Grant Hill about his painting collection). Television essays similar to the kinds delivered on PBS also appear, and the program generally has a stable of equally positive and negative news stories to fill up the program {{when there is no}} breaking news of note. Story lengths are longer (lasting up to twelve minutes at a time) and the pace of the program is considerably quieter and more relaxed than the Monday through Saturday CBS This Morning program. Commentators Ben Stein and Nancy Giles appear in recurring segments, delivering their opinion, and correspondent <b>Bill</b> <b>Geist</b> also contributes human interest stories. The program ends with a nature scene, not given a formal title for most of the program's history, but since entitled [...] "Moment of Nature" [...] as it is now a sponsored element.|$|E
5000|$|First, {{there was}} an opening segment in which Carlson {{introduces}} his panelist and debates four to five news stories with him or her. Second, in [...] "Crime Blotter," [...] Carlson introduced three stories about [...] "wrongdoing and justice served" [...] and typically discussed one of them with a guest, usually via satellite, {{on a number of}} topics related to a situation. Third, in [...] "The Outsider," [...] Carlson debated a variety of news-inspired issues with Max Kellerman, who played devil's advocate regardless of his personal viewpoint. Fourth, in [...] "Curious Situation", Carlson introduced a story in the news and was joined by a guest, usually via satellite and typically pre-recorded, to discuss this situation. Fifth, in [...] "First Look", Carlson was joined by his senior producer, Willie Geist, {{to take a look at}} tomorrow's news. Sixth, in [...] "Voicemail", viewers were encouraged to call in and leave messages for Carlson. Four to five messages, on a variety of topics ranging from stories that aired on the program to a drinking game for the show to Carlson's bow tie, were aired and commented on. Finally, in [...] "The Cutting Room Floor," [...] Carlson joked about non-serious stories with Geist, son of <b>Bill</b> <b>Geist</b> from CBS.|$|E
5000|$|The first honor flight {{took place}} in May 2005, when six small planes flew 12 {{veterans}} to Washington, D.C. Due to high participation, the program began using commercial flights. At the end of 2005, the program had transported 137 veterans to the memorial. In late 2005, Jeff Miller, a dry cleaning company owner in Hendersonville, North Carolina, inspired by Morse's vision, had a similar idea but on a larger scale. Miller, {{the son of a}} World War II veteran and nephew of a B-24 bomber pilot who died in the war, had been a charter member of the National World War II Memorial Foundation. Like Morse, Miller lamented that many World War II veterans would be unable to visit the memorial. The seed that Morse had planted grew to a veritable forest of volunteerism, fundraising and goodwill toward the Greatest Generation veterans, who had been too busy building their communities to demand recognition for wartime service. On 23 and 24 Sep and 4 Nov 2006, HonorAir flew more than 300 World War II veterans from the Asheville Regional Airport to Washington, free of charge. HonorAir provided everything: a medical doctor and several EMTs, guardians who would attend to the needs of three to four veterans each, tour buses to take them the World War II Memorial and other national memorials, and a box lunch. Ticket agents and passengers lined the ropes as veterans emerged from the charter jets into the terminal. [...] "CBS Sunday Morning" [...] aired a moving feature about the HonorAir effort in September 2006. <b>Bill</b> <b>Geist</b> updated the story in 2007 because it was a story that was so important to him.|$|E
