5|$|Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi, {{the first}} {{ruler of the}} Al Said dynasty, {{blockaded}} Muscat and captured the forts in 1749. He renovated them, particularly al-Jalali. The function of al-Jalali changed from passive defense of the harbor to a base from which troops could be dispatched. In the decades that followed the large central <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> round towers were added.|$|E
5|$|By 1844 {{there were}} 60 private patients. The {{building}} was refronted and a chapel added in 1851. The {{design of the}} <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> therapeutic regime were seen as models to be followed elsewhere, including at the General Lunatic Asylum of Nottingham at Sneinton, and the drafting of the 1808 County Asylums Act and Lunacy Act 1845.|$|E
5|$|During {{the lengthy}} period of ancient Rome, the Capitoline Hill was the {{geographical}} and ceremonial center. However, by the Renaissance, the former center was an untidy conglomeration of dilapidated <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> site of executions of criminals.|$|E
50|$|There are two (2) major {{buildings}} in the school: <b>the</b> main <b>building,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relocatable <b>building,</b> colloquially referred to simply as 'relo'. <b>The</b> main <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relocatable <b>building</b> are permanent, separated by teacher and student parking lots.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{development}} of Global Positioning System (GPS) {{are more and more}} mature, its accuracy is just acceptable for outdoor positioning, not positioning for <b>the</b> indoor of <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> underpass. For the positioning application area for <b>the</b> indoor of <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> underpass, GPS even cannot achieve that accuracy because of the construction materials while the requirement for accurate positioning in <b>the</b> indoor of <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> underpass, because a space, a person is necessary, may be very small space with several square meters in <b>the</b> indoor of <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> underpass. The Received Signal Strength (RSS) based localization is becoming a good choice especially for <b>the</b> indoor of <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> underpass scenarios where the WiFi signals of IEEE 802. 11, Wireless LAN, are available in almost every indoor of <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> underpass. The fundamental requirement of such localization system is to estimate location from Access Point (AP) to mobile device using RSS at a specific location. The Multi-path fading effects in this process make RSS to fluctuate unpredictably, causing uncertainty in localization. To deal with this problem, the combination for the method of Neural Networks and Push-Pull Estimation is applied so that the carried along the devices can learn <b>and</b> make <b>the</b> decision of position using mobile devic...|$|R

5|$|In 1994, the Duchy of Lancaster {{sold the}} Crewe Hall <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{adjacent}} industrial site, which became Crewe Hall Enterprise Park. The Crewe Hall buildings remained empty after Wellcome moved out and {{were sold to}} a hotel developer in 1998; the hall became a 26-bedroom hotel the following year. Several additional buildings in a modern style were constructed {{in the 21st century}} to extend the accommodation.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Federal Street, a major {{downtown}} thoroughfare {{that was}} closed off {{to create a}} pedestrian-oriented plaza, was reopened to through traffic.

5|$|Additional {{construction}} costs meant the final total was £736,000, up from an original estimate of £235,000. The need for heating {{brought with it}} the requirement for boiler houses, plus additional foundations which were needed for the buildings {{to the north of}} the railway. Lieutenant J.G.N. Clifts of the Royal Engineers created the design for the site and <b>buildings,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> contractor involved was a U.S. Army civil engineering company, appearing on records as American Construction Company. A temporary railway siding was created to aid in the delivery of building supplies. By 13 December 1918, several sheds had been completed, as were the Officers' Mess, sleeping quarters and the Navy and Army Canteen Board.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Caernarfon's local {{corporation}} {{undertook a}} programme of modernisation work, inserting several new gateways {{in the town}} walls; other changes were also made to the walls during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, prompted by the slate trade {{and the construction of}} the Chester to Holyhead railway line. As a result of this population pressure, by the 20th century housing had encroached along the inside and outside of the town walls, so that in many places the walls had vanished from view. During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired by the state and these houses demolished.|$|E
5|$|As Cindy moved inland, tornadoes {{touched down}} in North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland along the outer bands of the storm. A tornado was {{observed}} near Nags Head around 17:40UTC on July 10, {{and a second}} was observed 25minutes later. Both tornadoes caused minimal damage– the first damaged four <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second uprooted trees and toppled power poles. In addition, two waterspouts were noted offshore North Carolina, of which one was near New Topsail Beach in the mid-morning of July 8 and another near Sneads Ferry. No damage was reported from the waterspouts.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{contains}} ten {{levels in}} each of the four locations, all based on an event in Danny's past. The levels represent Danny's mind: a dark city landscape with many tall <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> occasional street lamp, a hotel resting aside a seaside location, a dark and mysterious funfair, and a haunted childhood bedroom. Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each level is to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their color. The exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can crawl into narrow areas and jump a small height.|$|E
5|$|Evolving {{methods of}} {{transportation}} and distribution led to declining business and {{the closing of the}} Union Stock Yards in 1971. National Wrecking Company negotiated a contract whereby National Wrecking cleared a 102-acre site and removed some 50 acres of animal pens, auxiliary <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eight story Exchange Building. It took approximately eight months to complete the job and ready the site for the building of an industrial park.|$|E

5|$|Excavation of {{the site}} began in 1971, and became the largest {{to be carried out}} by modern methods on any European monastic site. It {{revealed}} the foundations and lower parts of the walls of the monastery <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> abbey church. Important finds included: a Norman doorway; a finely carved arcade; a floor of mosaic tiles, the largest floor area of this type to be found in any modern excavation; the remains of the kiln where the tiles were fired; a bell casting pit used for casting the bell; and a large medieval statue of SaintChristopher.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 the 3rd Duke {{attempted}} {{to have the}} Wotton Tramway recognised as a railway, and William Yolland inspected the line in April 1873. The Railway Regulation Act 1844 defined minimum standards of travel, {{one of which was}} that the trains travel at an average of , which the Aveling and Porter locomotives could not manage. None of the stopping places had adequate station <b>buildings,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> line had no signals. Yolland permitted the line to continue as a tramway, but refused to recognise it as a railway.|$|E
5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, the J-Man of Just Games Retro said {{the game is}} overly slow, as the player must produce a few basic buildings and peasants in order to gather resources, and then start building combat units, while the enemy starts with more <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ability to immediately send out offensive units to undo the player's efforts. He also criticized that the basic units of {{the two sides are}} essentially identical and that the interface is clunky, but praised the resource system and effective enemy AI.|$|E
