50|$|<b>Bromperidol</b> (marketed as Bromidol, Bromodol) is a {{butyrophenone}} derivative. It is {{a potent}} and long-acting neuroleptic, used as an antipsychotic {{in the treatment of}} schizophrenia. It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1966.|$|E
50|$|Decanoate ester prodrugs {{of various}} {{pharmaceuticals}} are available. Since decanoic acid is a fatty acid, forming a salt or ester {{with a drug}} will increase its lipophilicity and its affinity for fatty tissue. Since distribution of a drug from fatty tissue is usually slow, one may develop a long-acting injectable form of a drug (called a Depot injection) by using its decanoate form. Some examples of drugs available as a decanoate ester include nandrolone, fluphenazine, <b>bromperidol,</b> and haloperidol.|$|E

The method was used to investigate an unusual case of death which occurred after <b>bromperidol</b> ingestion. A 44 year-old woman arrived at the emergency department in cardiac arrest. Her sister reported that the woman had taken several drops of a medicine containing <b>bromperidol.</b> An autopsy was performed and the biological fluid samples were submitted to a full toxicological work-up first {{and then to the}} target analysis of <b>bromperidol.</b> The analytical results obtained from the biological fluids collected at autopsy supported the hypothesis of death due to <b>bromperidol</b> intoxication...|$|E
40|$|Deficit {{syndrome}} (DS) in schizophrenia {{is characterized}} by serious, chronic, and primary negative symptoms. We investigated differences in response to neuroleptic treatment between 8 DS patients and 6 nondeficit syndrome (NDS) patients who had the selective dopamine-D 2 receptor blocker <b>bromperidol</b> added to their neuroleptic regimens. First, 9 mg/d was administered for 4 weeks, followed by 18 mg/d for another 4 weeks. Plasma homovanillic acid (pHVA) and plasma <b>bromperidol</b> concentrations were measured, and psychiatric symptoms were scored. In the NDS patients, {{both positive and negative}} symptoms improved. However, only the positive symptom scores changed in the DS patients. On day 4, pHVA concentrations of the NDS patients alone were significantly elevated. Plasma <b>bromperidol</b> concentrations did not differ between the groups. These results suggest that <b>bromperidol</b> exerts different effects on negative symptoms and pHVA concentrations between NDS and DS patients, effects that are unrelated to plasma <b>bromperidol</b> concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Seven butyrophenones {{in human}} whole blood were {{analyzed}} by LC/MS/MS using a new polymer column (MSpak GF- 310), which enabled direct injection of crude biological samples without complicated pretreatments. The quantitation was made by mass chromatography for each product ion, The recoveries were more than 50 % for haloperidol, <b>bromperidol,</b> moperone and spiroperidol at 80 ng/ml in whole blood, but less than 10 % for pimozide. The regression equations showed good linearity for haloperidol, <b>bromperidol,</b> moperone and spiroperidol {{in the range of}} 10 - 80 ng/ml, for timiperone in the range of 20 - 80 ng/ml and for pimozide in the range of 50 - 200 ng/ml using the chlorinated analog of haloperidol as internal standard, Their detection limits were about 5 ng/ml for haloperidol, <b>bromperidol,</b> moperone and spiroperidol, about 10 ng/ml for timiperone and about 25 ng/ml for pimozide. Thus, the present method seems useful for sensitive and specific detection and determination of their high therapeutic and toxic levels present in biological specimens including whole blood. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E

For their actual determination with forensic samples, a detailed procedure for their extraction from human whole blood and urine was established with Sep-Pak C 18 cartridges. The recovery of the 4 drugs, which had been added to whole blood and urine, was more than 90 %. Haloperidol in whole blood and urine of a schizophrenic patient, who had been administered with this drug (3 mg/day p. o.), could be quantitated by the present GC-SID, and the levels were 7. 18 and 43. 2 pmol/ml, respectively. rights:日本法医学会rights:本文データは日本法医学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|Therapeutic {{options for}} {{tuberculosis}} (TB) are limited and notoriously ineffective despite {{the wide variety}} of potent antibiotics available for treating other bacterial infections. We investigated an approach that enables an expansion of TB therapeutic strategies by using synergistic combinations of drugs. To achieve this, we devised a high-throughput synergy screen (HTSS) of chemical libraries having known pharmaceutical prop-erties, including thousands that are clinically approved. Spectinomycin was used to test the concept that clinically available antibiotics with limited efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis might be used for TB treatment when coadministered with a synergistic partner compound used as a sensitizer. Screens using Mycobacterium smegmatis revealed many compounds in our libraries that acted synergistically with spectino-mycin. Among them, several families of antimicrobial compounds, including macrolides and azoles, were also synergistic against M. tuberculosis in vitro and in a macrophage model of M. tuberculosis infection. Strikingly, each sensitizer identified for synergy with spectinomycin uniquely enhanced the activities of other clinically used antibiotics, revealing a remarkable number of unexplored synergistic drug combinations. HTSS also revealed a novel activity for <b>bromperidol,</b> a butyrophenone used as an antipsychotic drug, which was discovere...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of small Aβ 42 oligomers has been implicated as a toxic species in Alzheimer disease (AD). In strong {{support of this}} hypothesis we found that overexpression of Yap 1802, the yeast ortholog of the human AD risk factor, phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), reduced oligomerization of Aβ 42 fused to a reporter in yeast. Thus we used the Aβ 42 -reporter system to identify drugs that could be developed into therapies that prevent or arrest AD. From a screen of 1, 200 FDA approved drugs and drug-like small compounds we identified 7 drugs that reduce Aβ 42 oligomerization in yeast: 3 antipsychotics (<b>bromperidol,</b> haloperidol and azaperone), 2 anesthetics (pramoxine HCl and dyclonine HCl), tamoxifen citrate, and minocycline HCl. Also, all 7 drugs caused Aβ 42 to be less toxic to PC 12 cells and to relieve toxicity of another yeast AD model in which Aβ 42 aggregates targeted to the secretory pathway are toxic. Our results identify drugs that inhibit Aβ 42 oligomers from forming in yeast. It remains to be determined if these drugs inhibit Aβ 42 oligomerization in mammals and could be developed as a therapeutic treatment for AD...|$|E
40|$|Pharmacological {{specificity}} of several classes of {{drugs such as}} antipsychotics and antiischemic agents was assessed for σ receptors labeled with [(3) H] haloperidol. Specific binding of [(3) H] haloperidol {{in the presence of}} 25 nM spiperone was saturable and high affinity) Kd= 1. 96 ± 1. 31 nM, Bmax= 2. 37 ± 0. 27 pmol/mg of protein;n= 8). Among the 29 antipsychotics tested in inhibition studies, <b>bromperidol</b> and haloperidol were the most potent inhibitors (Ki= 0. 9 nM, 1. 0 nM, respectively). The conventional antipsychotics moperone, timiperone etc. and the novel promising drugs YM- 09151, Y- 516, BMY- 14802 and remoxipride potently inhibited [(3) H] haloperidol binding with the Ki in the range of low to moderate nanomolar. On the other hand, among the other 27 drugs tested, the antispasmodics eperisone and tolperisone, the antiischemic agents ifenprodil, the Ca(2 +) antagonist flunarizine and cinnarizine, and the antitussives carbetapentane, cloperastine and dextromethorphan, were especially potent inhibitors. These results, taken together with the evidence that the antiischemic agents ifenprodil and dextromethorphan antagozine NMDA responses and NMDA receptor complex is a possible site of action for neuroprotective agents, strongly suggest that σ receptors may be potential sites of action for antiischemic as well as antipsychotic drugs, i. e., σ receptors mediate the neuroprotective effects of certain antiischemic agents by affecting the NMDA receptor complex...|$|E
40|$|By using a structure-based {{computer-assisted}} search, we {{have found}} a butyrophenone derivative that is a selective inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1) protease. The computer program creates a negative image of the active site cavity using the crystal structure of the HIV- 1 protease. This image was compared for steric complementarity with 10, 000 molecules of the Cambridge Crystallographic Database. One {{of the most interesting}} candidates identified was <b>bromperidol.</b> Haloperidol, a closely related compound and known antipsychotic agent, was chosen for testing. Haloperidol inhibits the HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 proteases in a concentration-dependent fashion with a Ki of approximately 100 microM. It is highly selective, having little inhibitory effect on pepsin activity and no effect on renin at concentrations as high as 5 mM. The hydroxy derivative of haloperidol has a similar effect on HIV- 1 protease but a lower potency against the HIV- 2 enzyme. Both haloperidol and its hydroxy derivative showed activity against maturation of viral polypeptides in a cell assay system. Although this discovery holds promise for the generation of nonpeptide protease inhibitors, we caution that the serum concentrations of haloperidol in normal use as an antipsychotic agent are less than 10 ng/ml (0. 03 microM). Thus, concentrations required to inhibit the HIV- 1 protease are greater than 1000 times higher than the concentrations normally used. Haloperidol is highly toxic at elevated doses and can be life-threatening. Haloperidol is not useful as a treatment for AIDS but may be a useful lead compound for the development of an antiviral pharmaceutical...|$|E
40|$|Bromocriptine is an ergot {{alkaloid}} derivative that possesses both dopamine agonist and antagonist activity. This biphasic {{action has}} allowed bromocriptine {{to be used}} for many psychiatric disorders. We describe a rare case of schizophrenia with pituitary gigantism, whose psychiatric symptoms were improved by concomitant bromocriptine therapy with neuroleptics. The patient (a 30 -year-old single female) had been suffering from schizophrenia during the past 12 years. In remission, she was employed in accounting. At age 25, brain CT scanning revealed a pituitary tumor, but operation was not indicated. At age 30, she discontinued neuroleptics by herself. As a result, she had a relapse and entered a psychiatric hospital for the first time. Her psychiatric symptoms were auditory hallucination, delusion of persecution, reference and control, and depersonalization. Neurological symptoms were not present. Serum growth hormone ranged from 4 to 13. 6 ng/ml (normal 0. 6 - 3. 7 ng/ml). Brain MRI scanning also revealed a pituitary tumor, of a size less than 1 centimeter and localized in sella turcica. <b>Bromperidol</b> improved her symptoms for the most part, but depersonalization continued obstinately. After a while, she was started on bromocriptine 2. 5 mg daily together and increased gradually. At 7. 5 mg daily her depersonalization began to be reduced and then at 15 mg daily it disappeared. Through the course of treatment, there were no side effects of bromocriptine therapy. Generally at low doses bromocriptine acts on the presynaptic autoreceptor as antagonist activity, while at higher doses, bromocriptine works directly on the postsynaptic receptor as agonist activity. However in this case the effective dose was a moderate dose, 15 mg daily; finally bromocriptine may act as antipsychotic action. Concomitant bromocriptine therapy with neuroleptics were useful in schizophrenia with pituitary gigantism...|$|E

Methods: From the eight studies that met our selection criteria, two efficacy and six safety parameters were selected for calculation of number needed to treat (NNT), number needed to harm (NNH), {{and the likelihood of}} being helped or harmed (LHH) using comparisons of active drug relative to placebo. NNTs for prevention of relapse ranged from 2 to 5 for paliperidone palmitate, haloperidol decanoate, and fluphenazine decanoate, indicating a moderate to large effect size. Results: Among the selected maintenance studies, NNH varied considerably, but indicated a lower likelihood of encountering extrapyramidal side effects, such as akathisia, tremor, and tardive dyskinesia, with paliperidone palmitate versus placebo than with first-generation antipsychotic depot agents versus placebo. This was further supported by an overall higher NNH for paliperidone palmitate versus placebo with respect to anticholinergic use and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale positive score. LHH for preventing relapse versus use of anticholinergics was 15 for paliperidone palmitate and 3 for fluphenazine decanoate, favoring paliperidone palmitate. Conclusion: Overall, paliperidone palmitate had a similar NNT and a more favorable NNH compared with the first-generation long-acting injectables assessed.

40|$|Background: Psychomotor slowing is an {{intrinsic}} feature of schizophrenia, but {{little is known}} about its nature or to what extent it is influenced by antipsychotics. The Symbol-Digit Substitution Test (SDST) is an appropriate tool for assessing reduced processing speed, whereas performance on copying tasks may be more useful in evaluating psychomotor slowing. Objective: The primary aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of different antipsychotic agents on psychomotor slowing in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: This cross-sectional study compared performance on line- and figure-copying tasks in schizophrenic inpatients (matched for symptomatology, demographic variables, and duration of illness) treated with risperidone, olanzapine, other atypical antipsychotics (amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, or quetiapine), or conventional antipsychotics (<b>bromperidol,</b> flupentixol, haloperidol, pimozide, or zuclopenthixol) and in healthy controls. Other tests administered included the SDST to assess processing speed, the California Verbal Learning Test to gauge verbal memory, the Letter-Number Sequencing task to assess working memory, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test to measure executive function. Comparisons were made between each patient group and healthy controls; between patient groups; and, post hoc, between atypical and conventional antipsychotics. Results: The study included 26 patients treated with risperidone, 24 treated with olanzapine, 25 treated with other atypical antipsychotics, 21 treated with conventional antipsychotics, and 25 healthy controls. The groups were well matched in terms of sex, educational level, mean doses, and duration of illness. The conventional-antipsychotic group was significantly older (P = 0. 026) and had significantly higher positive symptoms scores (P = 0. 031) on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale compared with the risperidone group. Patients treated with conventional antipsychotics had significantly greater slowing on the copying tasks compared with patients treated with atypical antipsychotics (P ≤ 0. 050 for 3 of 4 measures generated by the copying tasks). No significant differences were found on the classic neuropsychological tasks. All patient groups had poorer performance on the psychomotor measures compared with controls. No significant differences were found between the groups receiving atypical antipsychotics. Conclusion: Based on performance on the line- and figure-copying tasks, atypical and conventional antipsychotics appeared to have differential effects on psychomotor slowing in these schizophrenic inpatients...|$|E
40|$|Background Antipsychotic {{agents are}} often used to treat neuropsychiatric {{symptoms}} (NPS) in dementia, although the literature is sceptical about their long-termuse for this indication. Their effectiveness is limited and there is concern about adverse effects, including higher mortality with long-term use. When behavioural strategies have failed and drug therapy is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw these drugs are recommended. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia are often reluctant {{to try to stop}} antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. Strategies to reduce antipsychotic use have been proposed, but a systematic review of interventions aimed at withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia has not yet been performed. Objectives : To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia in community or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on behaviour. Search methods : ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources were searched on 23 November 2012. The search included the following terms: antipsychotic* or neuroleptic* or phenothiazines or butyrophenones or risperidone or olanzapine or haloperidol or prothipendyl or methotrimeprazine or clopenthixol or flupenthixol or clothiapine or metylperon or droperidol or pipamperone or benperidol or <b>bromperidol</b> or fluspirilene or pimozide or penfluridol or sulpiride or veralipride or levosulpiride or sultopride or aripiprazole or clozapine or quetiapine or thioridazine combined wither terms such as discontinu* or withdraw* or cessat* or reduce* or reducing or reduct* or taper* or stop*. ALOIS contains records from all major healthcare databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria : Randomised, placebo-controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia. Data collection and analysis : Review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, rated their risk of bias and extracted data. Main results : We included nine trials with 606 randomised participants. Seven trials were conducted in nursing homes, one trial in an outpatient setting and one in both settings. In these trials, different types of antipsychotics prescribed at different doses were withdrawn. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low regarding blinding and outcome reporting and unclear for randomisation procedures and recruitment of participants. There was a wide variety of outcome measures. Our primary efficacy outcomes were success of withdrawal (i. e. remaining in study off antipsychotics) and NPS. Eight of nine trials reported no overall significant difference between groups on the primary outcomes, although in one pilot study of people with psychosis and agitation that had responded to haloperidol, time to relapse was significantly shorter in the discontinuation group (Chi(2) = 4. 1, P value = 0. 04). The ninth trial included people with psychosis or agitation who had responded well to risperidone therapy for four to eight months and reported that discontinuation led to an increased risk of relapse, that is, increase in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) -core score of 30 % or greater (P value = 0. 004, hazard ratio (HR) 1. 94, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 09 to 3. 45 at four months). The only outcome that could be pooled was the full NPI-score, used in two studies. For this outcome {{there was no significant difference}} between people withdrawn from and those continuing on antipsychotics at three months (mean difference (MD) - 1. 49, 95 % CI - 5. 39 to 2. 40). These two studies reported subgroup analyses according to baseline NPI-score (14 or less versus > 14). In one study, those with milder symptoms at baseline were significantly less agitated at three months in the discontinuation group (NPI-agitation, Mann-Whitney U test z = 2. 4, P value = 0. 018). In both studies, there was evidence of significant behavioural deterioration in people with more severe baseline NPS who were withdrawn from antipsychotics (Chi(2) = 6. 8; P value = 0. 009 for the marked symptom score in one study). Individual studies did not report significant differences between groups on any other outcome except one trial that found a significant difference in a measure of verbal fluency, favouring discontinuation. Most trials lacked power to detect clinically important differences between groups. Adverse events were not systematically assessed. In one trial there was a non-significant increase in mortality in people who continued antipsychotic treatment (5 % to 8 % greater than placebo, depending on the population analysed, measured at 12 months). This trend became significant three years after randomisation, but due to dropout and uncertainty about the use of antipsychotics in this follow-up period this result should be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions : Our findings suggest that many older people with Alzheimer's dementia and NPS can be withdrawn from chronic antipsychotic medication without detrimental effects on their behaviour. It remains uncertain whether withdrawal is beneficial for cognition or psychomotor status, but the results of this review suggest that discontinuation programmes could be incorporated into routine practice. However, two studies of people whose agitation or psychosis had previously responded well to antipsychotic treatment found an increased risk of relapse or shorter time to relapse after discontinuation. Two other studies suggest that people with more severe NPS at baseline could benefit from continuing their antipsychotic medication. In these people, withdrawal might not be recommended...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Many {{authors have}} {{described}} these last years the difficulty {{to establish a}} differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and frontotemporal dementia. However treatment and prognosis of these two separate diseases are not the same. Schizophrenia is a chronic syndrome with an early onset during teenage or young adulthood period and the major features consist of delirious ideas, hallucinations and psychic dissociation. However a large variety of different symptoms describes the disease and creates a heterogeneous entity. The diagnosis, exclusively defined by clinical signs, is then difficult and {{has led to the}} research of specific symptoms. These involve multiple psychological processes, such as perception (hallucinations), reality testing (delusions), thought processes (loose associations), feeling (flatness, inappropriate affect), behaviour (catatonia, disorganization), attention, concentration, motivation (avolition), and judgement. The characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia have often been conceptualised as falling into three broad categories including positive (hallucination, delision), negative (affective flattening, alogia, avolition) and disorganised (poor attention, disorganised speech and behaviour) symptoms. No single symptom is pathogonomonic of schizophrenia. These psychological and behavioural characteristics are associated with a variety of impairments in occupational or social functioning. Cognition impairments are also associated with schizophrenia. Since the original clinical description by Kraepelin and Bleuler, abnormalities in attentional, associative and volitional cognitive processes have been considered central features of schizophrenia. Long term memory deficits, attentional and executive dysfunctions are described in the neurocognitive profile of schizophrenic patients, with a large degree of severity. The pathophysiology of schizophrenia is not well known but may be better understood by neuronal dysfunctions rather than by a specific anatomical abnormality. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) {{is one of the most}} common causes of cortical dementia. FTLD is associated with an anatomical atrophy that can be generalised, with a frontotemporal or focal lobar predominance. Histologically there is severe neuronal loss, gliosis and a state of spongiosis. In a minority of case Pick cells and Pick bodies are also found. The usual clinical features of FTLD are divided in three prototypic syndromes: frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive non-fluent aphasia (PA) and semantic dementia (SD). FTD is the most common clinical manifestation of FTLD. FTD is first characterised by profound alteration in personality and social conduct, characterised by inertia and loss of volition or social disinhibition and distractibility. There is emotional blunting and loss of insight. Speech output is typically economical, leading ultimately to mutism, although a press of speech may be present in some overactive, disinhibited patients. Memory is relatively preserved in the early stage of the disease. Cognitive deficits occur in the domains of attention, planning and problems solving, whereas primary tools of language, perception and spatial functions are well preserved. PA is an initial disorder of expressive language, characterised by effortful speech production, phonologic and grammatical errors. Difficulties in reading and writing also occur but understanding of word meaning is relatively well preserved. In SD a severe naming and word comprehension impairment occur on the beginning in the context of fluent, effortless, and grammatical speech output. There is also an inability to recognise the meaning of visual percepts. The clinical syndromes of FTLD are associated with the brain topography of the degeneration. So considerable clinical overlap can exist between schizophrenia and FTLD and the object of the following case report is to remind the difficulty to make a differential diagnosis between these two pathologies. CASE REPORT: A 34 year old non-married man is admitted in mental health district of a general hospital for behavioural disturbances that include repeated aggressions towards his family. At initial interview visual and auditives hallucinations are described. The patient doesn't care about these abnormalities and a poverty of speech is observed. The affects, globally blunted, show some degree of sadness however. The patient's birth and early development were unremarkable. At the age of 26, the patient dismissed from his job because of poor performance and absenteeism. He spent a lot of time watching TV, showed poverty of speech and become sometimes angry and violent without an explanation. He was hospitalised for several months and a schizophrenia including predominant negative features, hallucinations and delusion was diagnosed. He was treated with <b>bromperidol,</b> could go back to home and was followed by a general practitioner for 8 years. The patient had a stereotyped way of life during these years with a poor communication and little activity. During the months preceding the current hospitalisation, these characteristics and avolition emphasised, urinary incontinence appeared. The patient receives risperidone 8 mg/day associated with citalopram 40 mg/day during several months of hospitalisation. No significant evolution is observed regarding apathic and stereotyped way of live. The capacity of communication remains very poor. Neurocognitive assessments reveal multiple and severe dysfunctions. Memory, executive and attentional tasks are extremely disturbed. Physical and neurological examinations reveal an isolated bilateral Babinski sign. Cerebral scanner and magnetic resonance show bifrontal atrophy and PET scan is normal. There are no significant abnormalities found on blood and urine samples and on lumbar puncture. The patient is sent to a chronic neuropsychiatric hospital and the treatment is stopped. One year later, a comparative evaluation is realised. The general clinical state shows no evolution. Neurocognitive assessments are repeated and severe dysfunctions are observed with more perseverations. DISCUSSION: A diagnosis of FTLD for this patient can be discussed regarding clinical features, neurocognitive testings and neuroradiological findings. Schizophrenia is a major differential diagnosis. Psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and age of onset are essential observations for the diagnosis of schizophrenia but can not exclude FTLD. Memory, intellectual functions, executive and attentional abilities may all be disturbed in schizophrenia and FTLD. Cerebral abnormalities well established in schizophrenia are lateral ventricles enlargements. Frontal lobar atrophy is a major argument for FTLD and is only a sporadic finding in schizophrenic populations. Schizophrenia and FTLD could be comorbid diseases by several ways. CONCLUSION: A differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and FTLD is difficult to establish. Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disease with a large variety of cognitive dysfunctions. Neurocognitive tools may improve our knowledge of schizophrenia. Case ReportsEnglish AbstractJournal ArticleSCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
