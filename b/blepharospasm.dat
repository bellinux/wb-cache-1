25|$|Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is {{characterized}} by involuntary contraction of facial muscles, typically occurring only {{on one side of}} the face. Like <b>blepharospasm,</b> the frequency of contractions in hemifacial spasm may range from intermittent to frequent and constant. The unilateral <b>blepharospasm</b> of HFS may interfere with routine tasks such as driving. In addition to medication, patients may respond well to treatment with Botox. HFS may be due to vascular compression of the nerves going to the muscles of the face. For these patients, surgical decompression may be a viable option for the improvement of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Blepharospasm</b> {{is a type}} of {{dystonia}} {{characterized by}} involuntary contraction of the muscles controlling the eyelids. Symptoms can range from a simple increased frequency of blinking to constant, painful eye closure leading to functional blindness.|$|E
25|$|Painful {{exposures}} to capsaicin-containing peppers {{are among the}} most common plant-related exposures presented to poison centers. They cause burning or stinging pain to the skin and, if ingested in large amounts by adults or small amounts by children, can produce nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and burning diarrhea. Eye exposure produces intense tearing, pain, conjunctivitis, and <b>blepharospasm.</b>|$|E
25|$|The initial {{effects of}} {{exposure}} were coughing, severe eye irritation {{and a feeling of}} suffocation, burning in the respiratory tract, <b>blepharospasm,</b> breathlessness, stomach pains and vomiting. People awakened by these symptoms fled away from the plant. Those who ran inhaled more than those who had a vehicle to ride. Owing to their height, children and other people of shorter stature inhaled higher concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam is {{used for}} the {{emergency}} treatment of eclampsia, when IV magnesium sulfate and blood-pressure control measures have failed. Benzodiazepines do not have any pain-relieving properties themselves, and are generally recommended to avoid in individuals with pain. However, benzodiazepines such as diazepam can be used for their muscle-relaxant properties to alleviate pain caused by muscle spasms and various dystonias, including <b>blepharospasm.</b> Tolerance often develops to the muscle relaxant effects of benzodiazepines such as diazepam. Baclofen or tizanidine is sometimes used as an alternative to diazepam.|$|E
25|$|In chapter II of this book’s Supplementum, Ramazzini {{noted that}} “Scribes and Notaries” may develop “incessant {{movement}} of the hand, always {{in the same direction}} … the continuous and almost tonic strain on the muscles... that results in failure of power in the right hand.” A report from the British Civil Service also contained an early description of writer’s cramp. In 1864, Solly coined the term “scrivener’s palsy” for this affliction. These historical reports usually attributed the etiology of the motor abnormalities to overuse. Then, dystonia were reported in detail in 1911, when Hermann Oppenheim, Edward Flatau and Wladyslaw Sterling described some Jewish children affected by a syndrome that was retrospectively considered to represent familial cases of DYT1 dystonia. Some decades later, in 1975, the first international conference on dystonia was held in New York. It was then recognized that, in addition to severe generalized forms, the dystonia phenotype also encompasses poorly-progressive focal and segmental cases with onset in adulthood, such as <b>blepharospasm,</b> torticollis and writer’s cramp.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the root}} of the problem is neurological, doctors have {{explored}} sensorimotor retraining activities to enable the brain to [...] "rewire" [...] itself and eliminate dystonic movements. The work of several doctors such as Nancy Byl and Joaquin Farias has shown that sensorimotor retraining activities and proprioceptive stimulation can induce neuroplasticity, making it possible for patients to recover substantial function that was lost due to Cervical Dystonia, hand dystonia, <b>blepharospasm,</b> oromandibular dystonia, dysphonia and musicians' dystonia.|$|E
2500|$|Protracted {{withdrawal}} syndrome refers to symptoms persisting {{for months or}} even years. A significant minority of people withdrawing from benzodiazepines, perhaps 10 to 15%, experience a protracted {{withdrawal syndrome}} which can sometimes be severe. Symptoms may include tinnitus, psychosis, cognitive deficits, gastrointestinal complaints, insomnia, paraesthesia (tingling and numbness), pain (usually in limbs and extremities), muscle pain, weakness, tension, painful tremor, shaking attacks, jerks, dizziness and <b>blepharospasm</b> and may occur even without a pre-existing history of these symptoms. [...] Tinnitus occurring during dose reduction or discontinuation of benzodiazepines is alleviated by recommencement of benzodiazepines. Dizziness is often reported as being the withdrawal symptom that lasts the longest.|$|E
50|$|Some {{drugs can}} induce <b>blepharospasm,</b> {{such as those}} used to treat Parkinson's disease, as well as {{sensitivity}} to hormone treatments, including estrogen-replacement therapy for women going through menopause. <b>Blepharospasm</b> {{can also be a}} symptom of acute withdrawal from benzodiazepines. In addition to <b>blepharospasm</b> being a benzodiazepine withdrawal symptom, prolonged use of benzodiazepines can induce <b>blepharospasm</b> and is a known risk factor for the development of <b>blepharospasm.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{causes of}} <b>blepharospasm</b> have been identified; however, {{the causes of}} many cases of <b>blepharospasm</b> remain unknown, {{although}} some educated guesses are being made. Some <b>blepharospasm</b> patients {{have a history of}} dry eyes and/or light sensitivity, but others report no previous eye problems before onset of initial symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} <b>blepharospasm.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is of two types: {{essential}} and reflex <b>blepharospasm.</b> The benign essential <b>blepharospasm</b> is a focal dystonia—a neurological movement disorder involving involuntary and sustained contractions {{of the muscles}} around the eyes. The term essential indicates that the cause is unknown, but fatigue, stress, or an irritant are possible contributing factors.|$|E
5000|$|The Greek word blepharon means [...] "eyelid". Spasm means [...] "uncontrolled muscle contraction". The term <b>blepharospasm</b> 'blef-a-ro-spaz-m can {{be applied}} to any {{abnormal}} blinking or eyelid tic or twitch resulting from any cause, ranging from dry eyes to Tourette's syndrome to tardive dyskinesia. The <b>blepharospasm</b> referred to here is officially called benign essential <b>blepharospasm</b> (BEB) to distinguish it from the less serious secondary blinking disorders. [...] "Benign" [...] indicates the condition is not life-threatening, and [...] "essential" [...] is a medical term meaning [...] "of unknown cause". It is both a cranial and a focal dystonia. Cranial refers to the head and focal indicates confinement to one part. The word dystonia describes abnormal involuntary sustained muscle contractions and spasms. Patients with <b>blepharospasm</b> have normal eyes. The visual disturbance is due solely to the forced closure of the eyelids.|$|E

50|$|Botulinum toxin {{injected}} into the pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscle {{has been shown to}} be beneficial in some cases associated with orbicularis oculi contraction or <b>blepharospasm.</b> Levodopa has been reported to improve symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. There have also been reports of improvement with trihexyphenidyl and valproic acid. Surgical treatment may be considered in severe cases or cases that occur with <b>blepharospasm.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, university-based ophthalmologists in the USA and Canada further refined {{the use of}} botulinum toxin as a {{therapeutic}} agent. By 1985, a scientific protocol of injection sites and dosage had been empirically determined for treatment of <b>blepharospasm</b> and strabismus. Side effects in treatment of this condition were deemed to be rare, mild and treatable. The beneficial effects of the injection lasted only 4-6 months. Thus, <b>blepharospasm</b> patients required re-injection {{two or three times}} a year.|$|E
5000|$|Drug therapy: Drug {{therapy for}} <b>blepharospasm</b> has proved {{generally}} unpredictable and short-termed. Finding an effective regimen for any patient usually requires {{trial and error}} over time. Anticholinergics, tranquillizing drugs and botulinum toxin are the mostly used therapeutic options. However serious side effects can be observed as well as failure of therapy. It is therefore not surprising that new therapies are constantly being tested. In this backdrop new evidence shows Mosapride can be a safe and affordable therapeutic option for <b>blepharospasm.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Blepharospasm</b> is any {{abnormal}} contraction or twitch of the eyelid. In most cases, symptoms {{last for}} a few days then disappear without treatment, but sometimes the twitching is chronic and persistent, causing lifelong challenges. In those rare cases, the symptoms are often severe enough to result in functional blindness. The person's eyelids feel like they are clamping shut and will not open without great effort. People have normal eyes, but for periods of time are effectively blind due to their inability to open their eyelids. In contrast, the reflex <b>blepharospasm</b> is due to any pain in and around the eye.|$|E
50|$|In December 1989, Botox, {{manufactured}} by Allergan, Inc., {{was approved by}} the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of strabismus, <b>blepharospasm,</b> and hemifacial spasm in patients over 12 years old.|$|E

50|$|An {{avulsion}} {{is sometimes}} performed surgically to relieve {{symptoms of a}} disorder, or to prevent a chronic condition from recurring. Small incision avulsion (also called ambulatory phlebectomy) is used to remove varicose veins from the legs in disorders such as chronic venous insufficiency. A nail avulsion is performed to remove {{all or part of}} a chronic ingrown nail. Facial nerve avulsion is used to treat the involuntary twitching involved in benign essential <b>blepharospasm.</b> However, it often requires additional surgeries to retain function and botulinum toxin injections {{have been shown to be}} more effective than surgical avulsions in treating benign essential <b>blepharospasm,</b> while causing fewer complications.|$|E
50|$|The typical infant who has {{congenital}} glaucoma usually is initially referred to an ophthalmologist because of apparent corneal edema. The commonly described triad of epiphora (excessive tearing), <b>blepharospasm</b> and photophobia may be missed until the corneal edema becomes apparent.|$|E
50|$|Meige's {{syndrome}} {{is a type}} of dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions that twist or are repetitive).It is also known as Brueghel's syndrome and oral facial dystonia. It is actually a combination of two forms of dystonia, <b>blepharospasm</b> and oromandibular dystonia (OMD).|$|E
50|$|Based on {{data from}} {{thousands}} of patients collected by 240 investigators, Allergan Inc. got FDA approval in 1989 to market Oculinum for clinical use in the United States to treat adult strabismus and <b>blepharospasm,</b> using the trademark Botox. This was under the 1983 US Orphan Drug Act.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blepharospasm</b> {{may also}} come from {{abnormal}} {{functioning of the}} brain basal ganglia. Simultaneous dry eye and dystonias such as Meige's syndrome have been observed. Blepharospasms {{can be caused by}} concussions in some rare cases, when a blow {{to the back of the}} head damages the basal ganglia.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-90s Bennett {{developed}} benign essential <b>blepharospasm,</b> which hindered {{his ability}} to keep his eyelids open and to tolerate light. Nevertheless, he continued to work, but at a somewhat reduced pace, concentrating increasingly on small collages and assemblages of wood, tacks, nails, foil, and found objects.|$|E
50|$|In {{the acute}} {{stage of the}} disease, a {{catarrhal}} conjunctivitis is present, with signs of ocular pain, usually <b>blepharospasm,</b> increased lacrimation, and photophobia. Miosis is also usually present. After a few days, this will progress to a keratitis and iridocyclitis. Other ocular problems may also occur, including conjunctival and corneal oedema, and aqueous flare.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blepharospasm</b> (eyelid twitching) is an {{involuntary}} spasm of the eyelid muscle. The most common factors {{that make the}} muscle in the eyelid twitch are fatigue, stress, and caffeine. Eyelid twitching is not considered a harmful condition and therefore there is no treatment available. Patients are however advised to get more sleep and drink less caffeine.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Oculinum Inc, Scott's micromanufacturer and {{distributor}} of botulinum toxin, {{was unable to}} obtain product liability insurance, and could no longer supply the drug.
