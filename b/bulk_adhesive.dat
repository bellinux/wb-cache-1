40|$|In this paper, the {{characterisation}} {{of damage}} in an epoxy adhesive has been investigated. <b>Bulk</b> <b>adhesive</b> samples {{were used in}} this study for two reasons; firstly the stress distribution in the <b>bulk</b> <b>adhesive</b> sample is simpler than that in a joint, secondly, the specimen's dimensions meet fatigue test specimen standards. Low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests with a load ratio of 0. 1 and a frequency of 5 Hz were performed on <b>bulk</b> <b>adhesive</b> dumbbell specimens. Damage curves, relating damage in the specimen to number of cycles to failure, were plotted using an isotropic damage equation in which damage is a function of stress, which decreases as damage progresses. The damage curves were then fitted using a LCF damage evolution law. This equation was derived from a dissipation potential function using Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) theory. Curve fitting was performed using a Robust Least Square technique rather than ordinary linear least square because the damage curve has extreme points (usually at the breaking point). Two damage parameters alpha and beta were found from the curve fitting process. This process resulted in different values of alpha and beta for different stress levels. The logarithmic alpha and beta points were then plotted respect against stress level and linear regression was used to determine alpha and beta as a function of stress. With this function, damage parameters for other stress level can be predicted...|$|E

The apparent free volume for all the adhesives remains constant as moisture is absorbed but plasticization takes place at high temperature and relative humidity, evidenced by the increased elongation and yield observed by strain values and scanning electron microscope.

Geckos possess subdigital adhesives composed mostly of β-keratin, a relatively stiff material. Biological adhesives like those of geckos have inspired empirical and modelling research which predicts that even stiff materials can be effective adhesives if they take on a fibrillar form. The molecular structure of β-keratin is highly conserved across birds and reptiles, suggesting that material properties of gecko setae should be {{similar to that of}} β-keratin previously measured in birds, but this has yet to be established. We used a resonance technique to measure elastic bending modulus in two species of gecko from disparate habitats. We found no significant difference in elastic modulus between Gekko gecko (1. 6  GPa± 0. 15  s. e.; n= 24 setae) and Ptyodactylus hasselquistii (1. 4  GPa± 0. 15  s. e.; n= 24 setae).

40|$|The {{failure of}} adhesively-bonded joints, {{consisting}} of metallic adherends and epoxy-based structural adhesive {{with a relatively}} low toughness ~ 200 J/m 2, has been studied. The failure was via quasi-static mode I, steady-state crack propagation and has been modelled numerically. The model implements a 'top-down approach' to fracture using a dedicated steady-state, finite-element formulation. The damage mechanisms responsible for fracture are condensed onto a row of cohesive zone elements with zero thickness, and {{the responses of the}} <b>bulk</b> <b>adhesive</b> and of the adherends are represented by continuum elements spanning the full geometry of the joint. The material parameters employed in the model are first quantitatively identified for the particular epoxy adhesive of interest, and their validity is verified by comparison with experimental results. The model is then used to conduct a detailed study on the effects of (a) large variations in the geometrical configuration of the different types of specimens and (b) the adherend stiffness on the predicted value of the adhesive fracture energy, G a. These numerical modelling results reveal that the adhesive fracture energy is a strong nonlinear function of the thickness of the adhesive layer, the other variables being of secondary importance in influencing the value of G a providing the adhesive does not contribute significantly to the bending stiffness of the joint. These results which fully agree with experimental observations are explained in detail by identifying, and quantifying, the different sources of energy dissipation in the <b>bulk</b> <b>adhesive</b> contributing to the value of G a. These sources are the locked-in elastic energy, crack tip plasticity, reverse plastic loading and plastic shear deformation at the adhesive/adherend interface. Further, the magnitudes of these sources of energy dissipation are correlated to the degree of constraint at the crack tip, which is quantified by considering the opening angle of the cohesive zone at the crack tip. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Triaxiality {{function}} (Rv) {{has been}} {{known as one of}} the important factors that responsible for damage initiation in adhesive bonding. Damage evolution law for low cycle fatigue (LCF) is function of Rv, von Mises equivalent stress (Seqv) and number of cycles (N). From previous research, it was found that the Rv values of two cases: <b>bulk</b> <b>adhesives</b> and single lap joint (SLJ), were close to unity. Those values are uncontrollable. Meanwhile, the damage equation for general solution contains Rv as an independent variable. There is need to choose another joint type that can characterise Rv as an independent variable. This paper presents the choice of scarf joint as specimen that can simulate variation of Rv. Several types of adhesive joints have been modelled and analysed using ANSYS as finite element analysis (FEA) tool. In ANSYS, Rv values were calculated directly from direct output results: von Misses equivalent stress and Hydrostatic stress. From FEA, it was shown that Rv changed as a function of adhesive bondline angle of the scarf joint. The values of Rv are constant along adhesive line except at the free edges. This choice is better than Cleavage joint where the values of Rv are not constant along adhesive line due to the presence of bending moment...|$|R

Moreover, {{the effect of}} silane functionalization was also investigated. According to preliminary tensile mechanical tests on bulk nanocom- posite samples, calcined and untreated zirconia nanoparticles were selected for the preparation of adhesives with various filler contents. The glass transition temperature increased up to a filler content of 1 vol% and then decreased, {{probably due to the}} concurrent and contrasting effects of chain blocking and reduction of the crosslinking degree. Also tensile modulus, stress at break and fracture toughness of <b>bulk</b> <b>adhesives</b> samples were positively affected by the presence of an optimal amount of zirconia nanoparticles. Mechanical tests on single lap aluminium bonded joints indicated that zirconia nanoparticles led to rele- vant enhancements of the shear strength of the joints. In particular, the shear strength increased by about 60 % for an optimal filler content of 1 vol%, and an adhesive failure mechanism was evidenced for all the tested specimens. Concurrently, a significant decrease of the equilibrium contact angle with water was observed for adhesives containing zirconia nanoparticles. It can therefore be concluded that the addition of zirconia nanoparticles can effectively improve epoxy adhesives, both by increasing their mechanical properties and by enhancing the interfacial wettability with an aluminium substrate...|$|R
30|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to investigate the effect of plasticity on the fatigue lifetime prediction of bonded joints using the stress-life approach. Stress distributions were calculated using FEA. Three material models were employed, one linear-elastic model and two elastoplastic models: Von Mises (pressure independent) and Drucker–Prager (pressure dependent). The effective stress was determined using three different critical distances. For each critical distance, three different methodologies of the TCD were applied. Predictions were based on SN curves obtained from the literature [7] involving scarf and single-lap joints (using the same adhesive used in the current investigation) at four different temperatures (− 35  °C, − 10  °C, RT, + 50  °C] under tension-tension cyclic loading with a stress ratio of R =  0.1. The input material properties for FEA were acquired from quasi-static experiments on <b>bulk</b> <b>adhesive</b> specimens at the same aforementioned temperatures. The adhesive under investigation was a toughened epoxy intended for structural applications.

The development of new adhesive bonding technologies shows the necessity for effective non-destructive quality assessment of the joints. In the present work, curing reactions of the epoxy structural adhesive were investigated by acoustic methods in pulse-echo mode at 20 MHz at isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. The changes of acoustic properties at the reaction reflect all phenomenological changes, which occur in epoxy adhesive during cure.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} electrically conductive adhesive joints exposed to elevated temperature and relative humidity conditions has been investigated, and failure mechanisms of conductive adhesive joints have been determined. Three model, silver-filled, epoxy-based adhesive {{systems have been}} studied in conjunction with printed circuit board (PCB) substrates with metallizations of Au/Ni/Cu and Cu. Double cantilever beam (DCB) tests have been adopted to investigate the effects of environmental aging on electrically conductive adhesive joints. This study reveals that conductive adhesives as well as substrate metallizations both play important roles in the durability of conductive adhesive joints. The rate of water attack on the interface of conductive adhesive joints with Cu plated PCB substrates is faster than for those with Au/Ni/Cu metallization. A possible explanation of this phenomenon is based on considerations of surface free energy and interfacial free energy. Following drying of the aged conductive adhesive joints, the fracture energy recovered to some extent. This recovery in the fracture energy {{could be attributed to}} the reversible effect of plasticization of the <b>bulk</b> <b>adhesives,</b> as well as the rebonding between the adhesive and the substrate during drying at 150 C. XPS analysis of DCB failure surfaces suggested that diffusion of Cu to the Au surface might have occurred on the Au/Ni/Cu plated PCB substrates during aging.

Most notched samples exhibited lower fatigue strength in comparison to un-notched, except in the low cycle fatigue range where un-notched and notched samples had similar fatigue strength. Stiffness degradation showed a correlation with applied stress, i. e. an increase in applied stress was accompanied by faster and stronger degradation.
