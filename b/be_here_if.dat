500|$|Cyrus {{was raised}} as a Christian and {{identified}} herself as such during her childhood and early adult life. Some recent quotes such as [...] "You are all stardust. You couldn’t <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>if</b> stars hadn’t exploded... So forget Jesus. Stars died {{so you can}} live", and social media content have led to questions surrounding her religious beliefs. Cyrus includes references to Tibetan Buddhism in the lyrics of [...] "Milky Milky Milk" [...] (2015). Cyrus came out as pansexual to her mother when she was 14, and has said: [...] "I never want to label myself! I am ready to love anyone that loves me for who I am! I am open." [...] In June 2015, Time reported that she also identifies as gender fluid. She was quoted as stating she [...] " [...] relate to being boy or girl, and I don't have to have my partner relate to boy or girl." [...] Cyrus is {{a supporter of the}} LGBT community, and is often vocal about her beliefs on the topic. Her song [...] "My Heart Beats For Love" [...] (2010) was written for one of Cyrus' gay friends, while she has since claimed that London is her favorite place to perform due to its extensive gay scene. Cyrus also has an equals sign tattooed on her ring finger in support of same-sex marriage. She is the founder of the Happy Hippie Foundation, which works to [...] "fight injustice facing homeless youth, LGBTQ youth and other vulnerable populations". Cyrus is open about her recreational use of cannabis. She told Rolling Stone in 2013 that it was [...] "the best drug on earth" [...] and called it, along with MDMA, a [...] "happy drug". While accepting the Best Video award at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, Cyrus smoked {{what appeared to be a}} joint on stage; this was removed from the delayed broadcast of the program in the United States. In a 2014 interview with W, Cyrus stated [...] "I love weed" [...] and [...] "I just love getting stoned." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Action Reports of {{the patrol}} {{were met with}} {{positive}} reviews, General Abrams formally approved the operation. The success of the operation was more valuable than just {{the destruction of the}} enemy, because it allowed Colonel Barrow to request that continued operations in Laos be approved. His reasoning for continued operations was the presence of the enemy in the area was a threat to his troops. Barrow noted, [...] "I put a final comment on my message, which said, quote, [...] "Put another way, my forces should not <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>if</b> ground interdiction of Route 922 not authorized." [...] The message finally reached General Abrams via General Stilwell, who had adopted the Colonel's recommendation. General Abrams approved [...] further action on February 24 but restricted discussions of the Laotian operation.|$|E

2500|$|On January 3, 2001, the Redskins hired former Browns and Chiefs {{head coach}} Marty Schottenheimer as head coach.

During the course of the season, the Redskins raised more than $700,000. [...] They finished the season with an 8–8 record and Schottenheimer was fired after the final game. Snyder later said in a 2013 interview on the firing of Schottenheimer, [...] "I like Marty and still do to this day, we are good friends, he'd still <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>if</b> he didn't want to do it all.

2500|$|Ford's {{father and}} former lead {{engineer}} at the Janjira nuclear plant until its destruction in 1999. Cranston has said that Edwards' approach to the film and to its characterization is what drew him to the project. He stated, [...] "The {{most important thing about}} this version of Godzilla is the characterization. The characters in this are real, well drawn. [...] takes the time to really establish who these people are, that you root for them, that you invest in these characters, and that you care for them. That's the best part of it." [...] Cranston additionally added, [...] "I wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>if</b> it was just, 'Look out, this monster is crushing everything!' Instead of trying to humanize the beast what this film does - and, I think, rightfully so - is humanize the people. You root for them and sympathize with their plight". Cranston also joined the film because he has been a fan of Godzilla since childhood, stating, [...] "Godzilla was always my favorite monster when I was young. He was unapologetic." [...] Cranston had to wear a wig for his scenes due to finishing Breaking Bad days before filming Godzilla. Cranston was initially ready to decline the offer after being approached, assuming the film was going to be [...] "silly", however, director Edwards' passion for the film and his previous film Monsters impressed Cranston enough to read the script and join the film. Cranston, despite his positive opinion on the film, would later opine that killing off Joe Brody so early was a [...] "narrative mistake".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fourth}} Test of their five-Test {{series against the}} West Indies in 1966, England were 3–0 down and had lost the series. Needing someone {{to come in to}} {{revitalise}} the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, [...] "I shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>if</b> we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, {{and we are going to}} keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days." [...] What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch – or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.|$|E
