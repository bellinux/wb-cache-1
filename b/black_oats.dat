The dynamics of aphids and {{the incidence of}} natural enemies are less known in pasture systems than in cereal fields. The objective of this work {{was to assess the}} aphid infestation and natural aphid parasitism in different pasture composition. Three hypotheses were tested: 1 - the aphid species composition in pastures may vary according to the cereal species in the field; 2 - the mixture of two plant species can modify the amount and diversity of aphids; 3 - the plant species composition of pasture fields influences the parasitism of aphids. Empirical data were obtained from three Poaceae fields: <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> (Avena strigosa L.), ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.), and a mixed field of <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> and ryegrass. The most abundant aphid species was Rhopalosiphum padi followed by Sitobion avenae. Plant species composition increases the amount and the parasitism rates of aphids. The mixture of heavily infested <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> with a poorly infested ryegrass resulted in reduction of aphid infestation in comparison with heavily-infested single plant species field.

Pela anÃ¡lise da mÃ©dia variÃ¢ncia, nÃ£o houve diferenÃ§a significativa entre os sistemas estudados. Pela distribuiÃ§Ã£o de probabilidade acumulada, a escolha da alternativa depende Ãºnica e exclusivamente do nÃ­vel de risco escolhido pelo tomador de decisÃ£o. Pelo mÃ©todo da dominÃ¢ncia estocÃ¡stica, o sistema II mostrou ser a melhor alternativa de produÃ§Ã£o a ser oferecida aos agricultores, dos pontos de vista de rentabilidade e de menor risco. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the profitability and risk of grain production systems combined with annual winter pastures, under no-tillage system. The experiment {{was carried out in}} Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil, in a six-year period (1990 - 1995). The systems were: system I (wheat/soybean, grazed black oats/soybean, and grazed black oats/soybean); system II (wheat/soybean and grazed <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> + grazed common vetch/corn); system III (wheat/soybean, grazed <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> + grazed common vetch/soybean, and grazed <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> + grazed common vetch/corn); and system IV (wheat/soybean, white oats/soybean, and white oats/soybean). An experimental design in blocks at random, with three replications and plots with 500 mÂ², was used. Three types of analysis were applied to the net return of systems: mean-variance analysis, distribution of accumulated probability, and stochastic dominance. When mean-variance analysis was used no significant differences were observed in the systems studied. By the distribution of accumulated probability, the selection of an alternative depends solely and exclusively on the level of risk chosen by the decision-maker. By the stochastic dominance method, system II showed to be the best production alternative to be offered to farmers from both profit and lower risk standpoints...|$|E

The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the influence of species intercropped with ryegrass on the botanical and structural composition and the nutritional values of pastures in an agroecological transition system. It was evaluated ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) intercropped with <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> (Avena strigosa Schreb.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and forage peanut (Arachis pintoi Krapov. & Gregory). It was used a complete random design with three treatments and three repetitions. The first grazing was done 21 days after emergence of the plants on the pastures with ryegrass and <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> and ryegrass and forage peanuts and 28 days after emergence on the pasture of ryegrass + white clover. The second grazing, on the pasture with ryegras + <b>black</b> <b>oats,</b> occurred 30 days after the first one, whereas on the other pastures, grazing occurred 37 days later. The rates of dry matter (DM) accumulation, {{from the beginning of}} period of exclusion until maximal production of dry matter were: 77. 7; 75. 0 and 71. 3 kg/ha/day of DM for the pastures intercropped with white clover, forage peanut and black cover, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT Cover crops {{contribute}} to nutrient cycling and may improve soil chemical properties and, consequently, increase crop yield. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate cover crop residue decomposition and nutrient release, and the effects of these plants on soil chemical properties and on onion (Allium cepa L.) yield in a no-tillage system. The experiment was carried out in an Inceptisol in southern Brazil, where cover crops were sown in April 2012 and 2013. In July 2013, shoots of weeds (WD), <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> (BO), rye (RY), oilseed radish (RD), oilseed radish + <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> (RD + BO), and oilseed radish + rye (RD + RY) were cut at ground level and part of these material from each treatment was placed in litter bags. The litter bags were distributed on the soil surface and were collected at 0, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 days after distribution (DAD). The residues in the litter bags were dried, weighed, and ground, and then analyzed to quantify lignin, cellulose, non-structural biomass, total organic carbon (TOC), N, P, K, Ca, and Mg. In November 2012 and 2013, onion crops were harvested to quantify yield, and bulbs were classified according to diameter, and the number of rotted and flowering bulbs was determined. Soil in the 0. 00 - 0. 10 m layer was collected for chemical analysis before transplanting and after harvesting onion in December 2012 and 2013. The rye plant residues presented the highest half-life and they released less nutrients until 90 DAD. The great permanence of rye residue was considered a protection to soil surface, the opposite was observed with spontaneous vegetation. The cultivation and addition of dry residue of cover crops increased the onion yield at 2. 5 Mg ha- 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{degree to}} which pruning helps {{reestablish}} balance in agroforestry was assessed in a system established in SÃ£o Carlos, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in 2008. Seven native tree species were planted at a density of 600 trees/ha in five strips of three rows each, and annual crops were cultivated in the 17 -m crop strips between the tree strips. Competition was established after 35 months, decreasing the aboveground biomass production of corn planted close to the trees. An assessment of <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> in the dry season following tree pruning showed that the proximity of trees caused reductions in plant and panicle density, aboveground biomass production, number of grains per panicle and grain weight. Because pruning was not sufficient to maintain crop yields, tree thinning is recommended {{in order to minimize}} competition and restore conditions for adequate crop production...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Weeds may be {{suppressed}} by winter cover crops {{and the use}} of organic herbicides such as vinegar. Black oat (Avena strigosa) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) winter cover crops were planted for 2 years as part of a sustainable production system for cotton in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and were till-killed each spring prior to cotton planting. Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri), common purslane (Portulaca oler-acea), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) were frequently-encountered winter and spring weeds. Both cover crops controlled winter weeds as well as did winter tillage without cover. <b>Black</b> <b>oats</b> plots had 8 % and 17 % more total winter weed cover than no-cover and hairy vetch plots, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to re-evaluate some aspects of the relative importance of organic matter on Mn solubility in acid soil conditions. Field study showed that <b>black</b> <b>oats,</b> oil seed radish, elephant grass, lupin, leucaena, and coffee leaves serving as mulch decreased Mn solubility as compared with bare soil. The decrease in Mn solubility with plant mulch was related to increase in soil moisture content. Laboratory study showed that increasing temperature from 25 to 100 ÂºC increased Mn solubility and total soil organic carbon was little changed; from 150 to 200 ÂºC increased both Mn solubility and organic carbon oxidation, and up to 300 ÂºC decreased Mn solubility and stoped organic carbon oxidation. Aluminum solubility always increased with increasing temperature. Organic matter exerted a control in both Mn and Al solubilities in acid soils...|$|E

40|$|This {{work had}} as {{objective}} {{to evaluate the}} performance of mechanisms of cutting of the no-tillage seedrills in different vegetable coverings and applied vertical loads. The experimental design used was in randomized blocks and factorial scheme 3 x 4, with four replications. The trials were accomplished with three different mechanisms of culting of the straw (plane disc, corrugated disc and wavy disc), using four different vertical loads (750, 1500, 2250 and 3000 N). All treatments were accomplished in five straw coverings (corn, sorghum, triticale, <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> and radish). The results showed that larger the amount of dry matter covering the soil, higher the demand of horizontal and vertical forces. The wavy disc promotes the largest values of area of mobilized soil and requires large horizontal force, vertical force and horizontal force per area of cutting depth of discs (specific force). The treatment with plane disc required higher values of the horizontal forces per area of mobilized soil and of vertical force in the corn and sorghum coverings...|$|E
40|$|A adequaÃÃo da cobertura vegetal ao sistema agrÃcola, com espÃcies que possuam em sua composiÃÃo quÃmica substÃncias capazes de auxiliar no controle das plantas invasoras, Ã alternativa promissora para diminuir o uso de herbicidas na agricultura. Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho foi analisar a interferÃncia dos resÃduos culturais de aveia preta e tambÃm do consÃrcio de aveia preta, ervilhaca comum e nabo forrageiro sobre a incidÃncia de plantas invasoras; emergÃncia de plÃntulas, crescimento de plantas e produtividade da cultura de soja; alÃm da qualidade da semente da soja colhida. O experimento foi conduzido em campo, nos anos 2007 / 2008, demarcando-se parcelas de 5 m x 2 m, com 1 m de bordadura entre elas e distribuÃdas em sete tratamentos, ao acaso, com cinco repetiÃÃes cada. Durante o desenvolvimento da cultura, avaliaram-se os parÃmetros: Ãndice de velocidade de emergÃncia, desenvolvimento de planta e incidÃncia de espÃcies invasoras. ApÃs a colheita, em laboratÃrio, foram avaliadas as sementes colhidas pela determinaÃÃo de teor de Ãgua, massa de 100 sementes, pureza, produtividade, porcentagem de germinaÃÃo e vigor. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi em esquema fatorial com dois fatores com testemunha e as mÃdias foram comparadas pelo teste de Tukey ao nÃvel de 5 % de significÃncia. Observa-se que as espÃcies invasoras nÃo diferiram estatisticamente entre os tratamentos. De maneira geral, os tratamentos nÃo influenciaram na altura de plantas e aumentaram a produtividade da soja. Entretanto, apresentaram sementes menos vigorosas quando submetidas ao teste de envelhecimento acelerado. A pureza das sementes foi menor quando submetida ao cultivo com aveia preta. A massa de 100 sementes foi alterada pelos tratamentos, sendo maior em cultivo sob aveia preta. Os demais parÃmetros analisados nÃo mostraram diferenÃas estatÃsticas. Conclui-se, portanto, que tais espÃcies sÃo indicadas como alternativa para cobertura de inverno, na rotaÃÃo de culturas com a soja, pois melhoram os aspectos agronÃmicos da cultura. The {{adjustment of}} a cover crop to the agricultural system, with species whose chemical composition has substances {{able to control}} weeds, is a promising alternative to decrease herbicides application in agriculture. So, this trial aimed at analyzing the interference of <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> residues as well as black oat, common vetch and forage turnip consortium on weeds incidence, seeds emergence, seedling emergence, plants development, soybean productivity and its harvested seeds quality. The trial was carried out on field, from 2007 to 2008, with 5 m x 2 m plots and 1 m of border among them, distributed in seven randomized treatments with five replications each. During the crop development, the following parameters were evaluated: emergence speed index, plants development and weeds incidence. After harvest, in the laboratory, harvested seeds were evaluated according to: water content determination, weight of 100 seeds, purity, productivity, percentages of germination and vigor. It was a factorial experimental design with two factors plus one control and the averages were compared by the Tukey test at 5 % level of significance. The weeds species did not differ statistically among the treatments. By and large, the treatments did not influence on plants heights, but increased the soybean productivity. However, the seeds showed less vigor when under the accelerated aging test. The seeds purity was inferior when they were under <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> crop. The weight of 100 seeds was changed by the treatments and they were heavier when grown on <b>black</b> <b>oats.</b> The other analyzed parameters did not show any statistic difference. It is, therefore, concluded that these species are good alternatives as winter covers in soybean crop under rotation system, since they improve the agronomic aspects of this culture...|$|E
40|$|Morphogenical and {{structural}} characteristics of <b>black</b> <b>oats</b> (Avena strigosa Schreb.) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) on pastures managed under two grazing intensities were quantified by using marked tiller technique. The expected intensities of disappearance of forage mass initial value were 35 % (low) and 65 % (high). Experimental animals were sheep and interval among grazing was determined through 300 degree-day thermal sum. The experimental design was completely randomized with two grazing intensities and two replicates. Leaf blades of oats and ryegrass were removed {{at an average}} proportion of 57. 5 % of their initial length for both grazing intensities. Among the morphogenical characteristics of oats, only elongation rate of defoliate leaf differed between grazing intensities, with values of 0. 059 and 0. 081 cm/degree-day for low and high intensities, respectively. Grazing intensities did not alter structural characteristics of oats mixed with ryegrass and red clover. High grazing intensity enables maintenance of a higher number of ryegrass expanding leaves (1. 7 leaves/tiller), thus it is suggested for management of pastures with oats mixed with Italian ryegrass and red-clover on intermittent grazing...|$|E
