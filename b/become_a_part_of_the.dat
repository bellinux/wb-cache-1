5|$|The {{legend of}} Mussie likely began around 1916, though folk tales claim that Canadian pioneer Samuel de Champlain {{wrote about it}} in the early seventeenth century. Despite the {{futility}} of numerous attempts to locate or capture Mussie, it has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local culture and a fixture in the local tourism industry.|$|E

5|$|Forster was {{not present}} in Mainz during the siege. As representatives of the Mainz National Convention, he and Adam Lux {{had been sent to}} Paris to apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an {{independent}} state – to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Republic. The application was accepted, but had no effect, since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and the old order was restored. Forster lost his library and collections and decided to remain in Paris.|$|E
5|$|What {{would become}} I-195 was first {{proposed}} in the late 1950s as a toll road called the Trenton-Asbury Park Expressway {{that was to be}} operated by the New Jersey Highway Authority, the owner of the Garden State Parkway at the time. In 1965, this road would be incorporated into a planned Central Jersey Expressway System. The western portion would <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Route 37 freeway that was to run from Trenton to Seaside Heights while the eastern portion would <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Route 38 freeway that was to run from Camden to Belmar. The two freeways were to meet near Fort Dix. By 1967, plans for the Route 38 freeway were canceled, leaving Route 37 as the only planned east-west freeway through central New Jersey. The routing of this freeway, which was to be called the Central Jersey Expressway, was changed to run from the Trenton area east to Wall Township In addition, officials pushed for Interstate Highway funding for the freeway, with funds to be diverted from the canceled I-278 in Union County. The proposed freeway would cost $60 million.|$|E
5|$|A few {{recent works}} have <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern repertoire, {{including}} scores and theatrical works by composers such as Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Franco Donatoni, and Sylvano Bussotti. These composers {{are not part}} of a distinct school or tradition, though they do share certain techniques and influences. By the 1970s, avant-garde classical music had become linked to the Italian Communist Party, while a revival of popular interest continued into the next decade, with foundations, festivals and organization created to promote modern music. Near the end of the 20th century, government sponsorship of musical institutions began to decline, and several RAI choirs and city orchestras were closed. Despite this, a number of composers gained international reputations in the early 21st century.|$|E
50|$|Oudekapelle was an {{independent}} municipality until 1971, when it <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> newly formed municipality of Driekapellen, together with Nieuwkapelle en Sint-Jacobskapelle. In 1977, Driekapellen itself <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Diksmuide.|$|R

5|$|La Masia is {{also the}} name of FC Barcelona's {{football}} training facilities, originally located near the Camp Nou in the Les Corts district of Barcelona. The original building itself was an ancient country residence (In Catalan: masia) built in 1702, and once Camp Nou was inaugurated in 1957, the building was remodelled and extended for use as the club's social headquarters. With the gradual expansion of the club, the building became too small for headquarters, and on 20 October 1979, La Masia was converted into a dormitory for young players from outside Barcelona. On 30 June 2011, the Masia building ceased housing the young sportsmen who are trained to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club’s professional teams. In a simple ceremony, the doors were closed and the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper took over {{the function of the}} residential center for the youngsters.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the book's publication, Garland had {{approached}} the film's producers—Andrew Macdonald and Andrew Reich—about a possible film, {{and wrote a}} 96-page script. The producers initially had trouble finding an actress to play Kathy. Mulligan was cast in the role after Peter Rice, {{the head of the}} company financing the film, recommended her by text message while watching her performance in An Education. Mulligan, a fan of the book, enthusiastically accepted the role, as it had long been a wish of hers {{to have the opportunity to}} play the part. The film's message and themes were the factors that attracted Garfield to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E
5|$|A bypass around New York City {{had been}} planned since the 1950s and would <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Interstate Highway System and receive the I-287 designation. The Cross-Westchester Expressway, which was {{originally}} designated as Interstate187, opened in 1960 as Interstate487 before later becoming part of I-287. The New York State Thruway portion of I-287, which included a crossing of the Hudson River, opened in 1955. In New Jersey, the proposed I-287 had originally been designated as FAI Corridor 104 and incorporated what was planned as the Middlesex Freeway. The New Jersey section of I-287 between the New Jersey Turnpike in Edison and US202 in Montville opened in stages between the 1960s and 1973; the remainder opened in 1994. The aging Tappan Zee Bridge is due to be replaced with a new span — construction started in 2013, with the first span opening in 2017. In addition, a proposed tunnel across the Long Island Sound between Rye and Oyster Bay on Long Island would link the eastern terminus of I-287 to New York State Route25 (NY25) and NY135 in Syosset.|$|E
50|$|In the Cretaceous, Laurasia {{split into}} the continents of North America and Eurasia. The Laurentian craton <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> North America while Baltica <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Eurasia, and Avalonia was {{split between the}} two.|$|R
50|$|Before the 1920s, Shyoltozero and {{neighboring}} villages formed the Shyoltozero pogost, which was <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Petrozavodsky Uyezd. With {{the advent of}} the Soviet state, the pogost <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Shyoltozersky District, which was dissolved in 1957 and <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Prionezhsky District.|$|R
50|$|After the World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish-Czechoslovak War and {{division}} of Cieszyn Silesia, the village <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Second Polish Republic.

5|$|Boy Scouting uses {{a series}} of medals and patches as emblems. The badge for the Scout rank {{consists}} of a simple fleur-de-lis, which symbolizes a compass needle. The needle points the Scout in the right direction, which is onward and upward. The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield. The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend it. The Second Class badge features a scroll inscribed with the Scout Motto, with the ends turned up and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom. The knot reminds each Scout to remember the Scout slogan, and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service. The First Class badge combines {{the elements of the}} Tenderfoot and Second Class badges. For years, the First Class badge was used as the emblem of the BSA. Star has a First Class symbol on a five-pointed yellow star, and initially indicated the five merit badges required to earn the rank. Life has a First Class emblem on a red heart, and initially symbolized the first-aid and health-related merit badges that the rank required. Now it signifies that the ideals of Scouting have <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scout's life and character.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{withdrawal}} of Israeli forces, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser issued several reforms in Gaza, including the expansion of educational opportunities and civil services, provision of housing {{and the establishment of}} local security forces. As in Egypt, political activity in Gaza was severely curtailed, but the government-sponsored Arab National Union was established in place of the All-Palestine Government that Nasser abolished in 1959, which gave the city's citizens a greater voice in national politics. In 1959, with the abolishment of the All-Palestine Government, Gaza had officially <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Arab Republic, a union of Syria and Egypt, under the pan-Arab policy of Nasser. In reality however, Gaza turned to be under direct Egyptian military governorship, which also continued upon {{the withdrawal}} of Syria from the UAR shortly afterwards. When the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded in 1964, Nasser formally, but not practically, proclaimed that it would hold authority over Gaza, and a year later, conscription was instituted for the Palestinian Liberation Army.|$|E
5|$|After the Austro-Hungarian Empire {{collapsed}} in 1918, the Austrians {{wanted to turn}} the fleet over to the newly created State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (later to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Yugoslavia) {{in order to prevent}} the Italians from claiming the ships as spoils of war. However, the victorious Allies refused to acknowledge the conversations between the Austrians and the south Slavs and, in due course, reallocated the ships. The ship had been boarded by a scratch Yugoslav crew on 10 November 1918, one day before the Armistice, and had left Pola along with her sister ship, Radetzky. They were soon spotted by heavy Italian ships, so the two battleships hoisted American flags and sailed south along the Adriatic coast to Castelli Bay near Spalato (also known as Split). They appealed for American naval forces to meet them and accept their surrender, which a squadron of United States Navy (USN) submarine chasers in the area did. She had apparently been turned over to the fledgling south Slav state, as it was a Croat naval officer, Korvettenkapitän Marijan Polić, who presented the ship as a prize of war to representatives of the United States Navy on the afternoon of 22 November 1919 at Spalato (Split) in Dalmatia. Simultaneously she was commissioned as USS Zrínyi and Lieutenant E.E. Hazlett, USN, assumed command. The initial American complement consisted of four officers and 174 enlisted men—the latter entirely composed of United States Navy Reserve Force personnel. The ship remained at anchor at Spalato for nearly a year while the negotiations that would determine her ultimate fate dragged on. Only once did she apparently turn her engines over, and that occurred during a severe gale that struck Spalato on 9 February 1920.|$|E
50|$|In 1775-1779, the {{territory}} of Belgorod Governorate was abolished and divided between the newly formed governorates and vice-royalties. The city of Belgorod and the area around it <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Kursk Vice-Royalty, while the southeastern uyezds <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Voronezh Governorate.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{inhabited}} by Lach-speaking Czech population. After World War I and fall <b>of</b> Austria-Hungary it <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Czechoslovakia.

50|$|During {{the time}} of the Napoleonic Wars Aach was—according to the Treaty <b>of</b> Lunéville 1802—a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> France. After Napoleon's {{ultimate}} defeat in 1815 Aach <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the new Prussian Rhineland province. Prussia itself <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the German Empire in 1871.|$|R
5|$|The first {{portion of}} Port Republic Road to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state highway system was from Main Street (now SR 605) in Port Republic north to Pineville Road (now SR 672). That highway, SR 809, ran from Greenville through Waynesboro and Grottoes to SR 17 (now US 33) at Montevideo between Harrisonburg and Elkton by 1928. In 1930, the state highway was {{relocated}} {{to the east}} side of the South River from Grottoes to Port Republic along South River Road (now SR 825). SR 809 was not paved along Port Republic Road until 1932. As of 1932, the remainder of Port Republic Road followed highways maintained by the city of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County. These included county route (CR) 31 from Harrisonburg through the junction with CR 12 (now SR 276) near Cross Keys to Goods Mill Road (now SR 708), on which CR 31 continued. Port Republic Road continued along CR 214 to Battlefield Road (then CR 7, now SR 679). The road continued along CR 7 to the junction with SR 809. CR 31 was paved from Harrisonburg to about the modern city limits of Harrisonburg, and CR 7 was paved from SR 809 to the Battlefield Road split. By July 1933, after the passage of the Byrd Road Act that established Virginia's secondary highway system and transferred maintenance responsibility for local highways from the county to the state, all of Port Republic Road's route numbers changed. SR 807 became part of SR 340, which became SR 12 in 1936. After the East Side Highway, the modern route of US 340, was completed from Grottoes to Elkton in 1941, SR 12 was moved to the new highway by 1944; the old highway became SR 865.|$|E
