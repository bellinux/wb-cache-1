To meet the structural challenge of spanning 130 feet (40m) without a steep increase in elevation, the deck’s structure must be as thin as possible while remaining stable. This suspension bridge uses a steel frame that derives its stiffness from tension by using a single <b>mast</b> that is <b>tilted</b> toward {{one end of the}} bridge.

50|$|A {{small amount}} of lee helm can be counteracted with the rudder, but this {{introduces}} significant drag {{in the water and}} slows the boat. A {{small amount of}} lee helm can also be cured by raking the <b>mast</b> <b>backward,</b> reducing the size of the Jib on a Sloop rigged boat, or increasing the size of the mizzen sail on a Yawl or a Ketch. Large amounts of lee helm can only be corrected by altering the placement of the mast(s) or keel/centerboard --- a non-trivial venture.|$|R
50|$|The mast {{pieces were}} driven {{over the new}} road deck lying down horizontally. The pieces were joined to form the one {{complete}} mast, still lying horizontally. The <b>mast</b> was then <b>tilted</b> upwards, as one piece, at one time in a tricky operation. In this way, each mast was erected {{on top of the}} corresponding concrete pylon. The stays connecting the masts and the deck were then installed, and the bridge was tensioned overall, and weight tested. After this, the temporary pylons could be removed.|$|R
50|$|The pilot {{tries to}} {{perfectly}} balance a helicopter {{so that the}} fuselage remains horizontal in hovering flight, with no cyclic pitch control needed except for wind correction. Since the fuselage acts as a pendulum suspended from the rotor, changing {{the center of gravity}} changes the angle at which the aircraft hangs from the rotor. When the center of gravity is directly under the rotor mast, the helicopter hangs horizontal; if the CG is too far forward of the mast, the helicopter hangswith its nose tilted down; if the CG is too far aft of the <b>mast,</b> the nose <b>tilts</b> up.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} three technical {{elements that}} we have developed to improve {{the accuracy of the}} visual target tracking for single-sol approach-and-instrument placement in future Mars rover missions. An accurate, straightforward method of rover mast calibration is achieved by using a total station, a camera calibration target, and four prism targets mounted on the rover. The method was applied to Rocky 8 rover mast calibration and yielded a 1. 1 -pixel rms residual error. Camera pointing requires inverse kinematic solutions for <b>mast</b> pan and <b>tilt</b> angles such that the target image appears right {{at the center of the}} camera image. Two issues were raised. Mast camera frames are in general not parallel to the masthead base frame. Further, the optical axis of the camera model in general does not pass through the center of the image. Despite these issues, we managed to derive non-iterative closed-form exact solutions, which were verified with Matlab routines. Actual camera pointing experiments over 50 random target image points yielded less than 1. 3 -pixel rms pointing error. Finally, a purely geometric method for camera handoff using stereo views of the target has been developed. Experimental test runs show less than 2. 5 pixels error on high-resolution Navcam for Pancam-to-Navcam handoff, and less than 4 pixels error on lower-resolution Hazcam for Navcam-to-Hazcam handoff.

2500|$|One of {{the issues}} Western {{designers}} have with the proa {{is the need to}} manipulate the sail when shunting. Even Munroe's early sails discarded the curved yards of the traditional crabclaw for the more familiar straight yards of the lateen and lug sails. Munroe's designs likely lacked the <b>tilting</b> <b>mast</b> because he was unaware of it, but many designers since have use a fixed mast, and provided some other way of adjusting the center of effort. [...] Most sailboats are designed with the center of effort of the sails slightly ahead of the center of area of the underwater plane; this difference is called [...] "lead." [...] In a proa hull, and in all fore and aft symmetric foils, the center of resistance is not at or even {{near the center of the}} boat, it is well forward of the geometric center of area. Thus the center of effort of the sails needs to also be well forward, or at least needs to have a sail which is well forward which can be sheeted in to start the boat moving, allowing the rudders to bite and keep the boat from heading up when the entire sail area is sheeted in. [...] Jzero, for example, and all of Russell Brown's other designs, use a sloop rig and hoist a jib on whichever end is the current [...] "bow". Other designs use a schooner rig for the same effect.|$|R
40|$|This project aims {{to develop}} a Cubesat Ground Station by {{utilizing}} amateur radio technology and COTS devices. Pursuing the work done by previous students, the system was finalised and then constructed. In addition, a further objective of this project is to design antenna <b>mast</b> support with <b>tilting</b> function for easy installation and maintenance. Mast support design was carried out {{with the help of}} Catia V 5 R 17. As the structure will be bolted on the steel grid floor on the roof of B 52 A, it was suggested to be stronger as it will be on the roof and last for 10 years. With suggestions from amateur radio professional and mechanical technician, the support structure was designed to use two channels and then bolt to the base plate. Antenna mast was made of 3 ” and 2 ” galvanised steel tubes. To enable the pivoting function, a specially designed aluminium block is used to hold the mast and pivot around the pin joint. Remote control of the Ground Station was enabled by remote controlling of the control computer. Splashtop desktop control software was selected for its fast control performance. However, to fully control the ground station, the power of each device has to be controllable, and also for the newly delivered polarisation switches. A Webserver controller was built by the inspiration of the IP Switch which was planned to use. It consists of an open source microcontroller Aruduino and its Ethernet Shield. Simple control interface was written in html code and embedded in the webserver. It controls the polarisation switches and power switch of each device, and also the radio on/off with a servo mechanism. Remote power on of the control computer was enabled by configuring its BIOS. Finally, the ground station is fully controllable. Validerat; 20121224 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
40|$|A visual-tracker {{computer}} program controls an articulated mast on a Mars rover {{to keep a}} designated feature (a target) in view while the rover drives toward the target, avoiding obstacles. Several prior visual-tracker programs have been tested on rover platforms; most require very small and well-estimated motion between consecutive image frames a requirement that is not realistic for a rover on rough terrain. The present visual-tracker {{program is designed to}} handle large image motions that lead to significant changes in feature geometry and photometry between frames. When a point is selected in one of the images acquired from stereoscopic cameras on the mast, a stereo triangulation algorithm computes a three-dimensional (3 D) location for the target. As the rover moves, its body-mounted cameras feed images to a visual-odometry algorithm, which tracks two-dimensional (2 D) corner features and computes their old and new 3 D locations. The algorithm rejects points, the 3 D motions of which are inconsistent with a rigid-world constraint, and then computes the apparent change in the rover pose (i. e., translation and rotation). The <b>mast</b> pan and <b>tilt</b> angles needed to keep the target centered in the field-of-view of the cameras (thereby minimizing the area over which the 2 D-tracking algorithm must operate) are computed from the estimated change in the rover pose, the 3 D position of the target feature, and a model of kinematics of the mast. If the motion between the consecutive frames is still large (i. e., 3 D tracking was unsuccessful), an adaptive view-based matching technique is applied to the new image. This technique uses correlation-based template matching, in which a feature template is scaled by the ratio between the depth in the original template and the depth of pixels in the new image. This is repeated over the entire search window and the best correlation results indicate the appropriate match. The program could be a core for building application programs for systems that require coordination of vision and robotic motion...|$|R
