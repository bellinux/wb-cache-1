5|$|Camouflage is a soft-tissue {{feature that}} is rarely {{preserved}} in the fossil record, but rare fossilised skin samples from the Cretaceous period show that some marine reptiles were countershaded. The skins, pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin, reveal that both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs had dark <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> light bellies.|$|E
5|$|Countershading {{existed in}} marine {{reptiles}} in the Cretaceous period. Fossilised skin pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin reveals that both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs had dark <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> light bellies. The ornithischian dinosaur Psittacosaurus similarly {{appears to have}} been countershaded, implying that its predators detected their prey by deducing shape from shading. Modelling suggests further that the dinosaur was optimally countershaded for a closed habitat such as a forest.|$|E
5|$|In the game, Mario {{is portrayed}} as an Italian-American plumber who, along with his younger brother Luigi, has to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers below New York City. The {{gameplay}} focuses on Mario's extermination of them by flipping them on their <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> kicking them away. The original versions of Mario Bros.—the arcade version and the Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System (FC/NES) version—were received positively by critics.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's offense {{averaged}} 21.6points and 320total {{yards per}} game during the regular season, good enough for ninth in the Big Ten. As a whole, the Hoosiers accumulated 3,818yards of offense before the Independence Bowl. 2,156yards of this total were passing yards and came through the air, while the remaining 1,662yards were gained by Indiana's running <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> fullbacks on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Rugby union {{took root}} in Wales in 1850, when Reverend Rowland Williams became Vice-Principal at St David's College, Lampeter, where he {{introduced}} the sport. Wales played their first international on 19 February 1881; organised by Newport's Richard Mullock, Wales played against England, losing by seven goals, one drop goal and six tries to nil (8–0). On 12 March 1881, the Welsh Rugby Union was formed at The Castle Hotel, Neath. Two years later, the Home Nation Championshipnow the Six Nations Championshipwas first played and Wales did not register a win. However, rugby in Wales developed and, by the 1890s, the Welsh had developed the four three-quarters formation. This formation – with seven <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> eight forwards, instead of six <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> nine forwards – revolutionised {{the sport and}} was eventually adopted almost universally at international and club level.|$|E
5|$|The team {{departed}} {{aboard the}} Rimutaka {{and during the}} voyage conducted training drills on the ship's deck; for this the forwards were coached by the team's captain, Dave Gallaher, with help from Cunningham. Vice-captain and first five-eighth Billy Stead {{was in charge of}} the <b>backs,</b> <b>and</b> consequently the services of the New Zealand Rugby Union-appointed coach Jimmy Duncan were not used.|$|E

5|$|Treecreepers {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds with brown <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> white underparts. They have thin pointed down-curved bills, which {{they use to}} extricate insects from bark. They have stiff tail feathers, like woodpeckers, which they use to support themselves on vertical trees. One species has been recorded in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Adults have neutral grey heads, brown necks, brown-sepia striped <b>backs,</b> <b>and</b> grey-white bellies, breasts, and throats. Males {{have some}} buff {{markings}} on their breasts, and less sharp brown spots on their napes than females. The Perijá tapaculo is a secretive bird and therefore difficult to observe; {{as a result}} its ecology is poorly known. It feeds on insects and reproduces between April and July. Its range is partially within Chamicero de Perijá Bird Reserve in Colombia and the Sierra de Perijá National Park in Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|E. rabborum was {{remarkable}} {{in that the}} males appeared to provide nutrition to the tadpoles directly. During the day, the males backed into the tadpole-filled water of the tree holes and remained in that half-submerged state until night. During this time, the tadpoles swam around them, rasping small pieces of skin from their fathers' <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> eating them. This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it {{was similar to the}} way some female caecilians feed their young.|$|E
50|$|Martin {{produced}} mahogany and rosewood bodied tiples, {{following a}} model-identification system similar to its guitars: T-15 and T-17, mahogany top, <b>back</b> <b>and</b> sides; T-18, spruce top, mahogany <b>back</b> <b>and</b> sides; T-28, spruce top, rosewood <b>back</b> <b>and</b> sides; T-45, spruce top, rosewood <b>back</b> <b>and</b> sides, fancy abalone inlay. Martin's tiple production continued off-and-on into the 1970s. http://martintiple.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/martin-tiple-t-17-t-15-models.htmlSimilar instruments {{were made by}} Regal and other companies during {{the early decades of}} Martin production.|$|R

5|$|Leather was not {{infrequently}} used {{even for}} the costly and elaborate chairs of the faldstool form—occasionally sheathed in thin plates of silver—which Venice sent all over Europe. To this day, indeed, leather {{is one of the}} most frequently employed materials for chair covering. The outstanding characteristic of most chairs until the middle of the 17th century was massiveness and solidity. Being usually made of oak, they were of considerable weight, and it was not until the introduction of the handsome Louis XIII chairs with cane <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> seats that either weight or solidity was reduced.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{are white}} to cream on their ventral (belly) surfaces. Their <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> flanks are usually yellowish-green to green, overlain with heavy darker green, but {{occasionally}} brown or black, mottling. The {{effect is a}} marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard's markings. Colouration is related to water clarity; colouration is intense in fish from clear water habitats. Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration. Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey-green colouration.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur {{somewhat}} {{like a cat}} would, licking their front paws and then rubbing their backs, torsos, and sides. They also rub their <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> bellies {{along the sides of}} trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, marking with urine and a weak musk-smelling secretion from their anal glands. They search for food running along the ground or through the trees. Red pandas may use their forepaws alternately to bring food to their mouths or place food directly into their mouths.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{flags in}} Japan {{date from the}} unification period in the late 16th century. The flags belonged to each daimyō and were used primarily in battle. Most of the flags were long banners usually charged with the mon (family crest) of the daimyō lord. Members of the same family, such as a son, father, and brother, had different flags to carry into battle. The flags served as identification, and were displayed by soldiers on their <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> horses. Generals also had their own flags, most of which differed from soldiers' flags due to their square shape.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} (as {{represented}} by the nominate subspecies T. p. philomelos) is 20 to 23.5centimetres (8 to 9.25in) in length and weighs 50–107grammes (1.8 to 3.8oz). The sexes are similar, with plain brown <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> neatly black-spotted cream or yellow-buff underparts, becoming paler on the belly. The underwing is warm yellow, the bill is yellowish and the legs and feet are pink. The upperparts of this species become colder in tone from west to east across the breeding range from Sweden to Siberia. The juvenile resembles the adult, but has buff or orange streaks {{on the back and}} wing coverts.|$|E
5|$|Warner {{invented the}} single and double wing formations, the three-point stance, {{and the modern}} body block technique. He {{introduced}} several plays, such as the trap run, the bootleg, the naked reverse, and the screen pass. He {{was among the first}} to use the huddle, to number plays, and to teach the spiral pass and spiral punt. He improved shoulder and thigh pads; and was the first to utilize adjustable fiber, rather than cotton. He also had his own helmet color-coding: red for <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> white for ends.|$|E

5|$|After Mayor Quimby {{makes an}} {{offensive}} joke about France, {{and refuses to}} apologize, the French president launches a neutron bomb directly into Springfield, killing everyone except Homer, who had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering buying from Herman's military surplus store. After the blast, Homer emerges from the shelter {{and seems to be}} the only person in town to survive the blast, but he is soon confronted by a band of hostile Springfield citizens who have become mutants. Homer flees back home where he discovers that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its layers of lead paint. Marge and the children kill the mutants with shotguns that they were hiding behind their <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> the family head off to steal some Ferraris.|$|E
5|$|Amphibian skin is {{permeable}} to water. Gas exchange {{can take}} place through the skin (cutaneous respiration) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising {{to the surface of}} water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds. To compensate for their thin and delicate skin, amphibians have evolved mucous glands, principally on their heads, <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> tails. The secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist. In addition, most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances. Some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect. The main poison-producing glands, the paratoids, produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads, along the backs of frogs, behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E
