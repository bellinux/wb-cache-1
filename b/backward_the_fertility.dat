The present study analyzes the geographic variation across Danish municipalities in <b>the</b> <b>fertility</b> rate during <b>the</b> years 1982 to 2004. Several factors commonly believed to explain the variation in <b>the</b> <b>fertility</b> rate {{is found to be}} exerted to considerable regional variation. A model linking <b>the</b> <b>fertility</b> rate to several economic determinants is established and further modified to capture geographic small-area variation. A positive correlation between regional levels of income and fertility is found, which contradicts <b>the</b> <b>fertility</b> paradox. Thus, <b>the</b> necessity of separating small-area and dynamic variation, aiming at obtain a proper interpretation of <b>the</b> link between <b>fertility</b> and its determinants, is demonstrated...|$|R

In this paper we therefore compare <b>the</b> <b>fertility</b> of Danish twins born 1945 - 64 to <b>the</b> <b>fertility</b> pattern of <b>the</b> general population born during the same period. Our analyses find a very close correspondence between <b>the</b> <b>fertility</b> pattern of twins and of the general population. There exist only few statistically significant differences, and the primary difference pertains to the fact that female twins have a slightly later onset of childbearing than non-twins. There are virtually no relevant differences between <b>the</b> <b>fertility</b> patterns of dizygotic and monozygotic twins. ...|$|R

The main purpose of this work was to establish a protocol for the evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>fertility</b> of <b>the</b> chosen stallions. We were interested in realizing a general clinical examination and of the genital apparatus, a detailed laboratory exam of the collected semen and the pregnancy rate in broodmares. This study was conducted on eight adult stallions. After a general clinical exam, the semen was collected and evaluated macroscopically and microscopically by using the photometric method device Spermacue (Minitub). <b>The</b> <b>fertility</b> of each stallion was assessed by the pregnancy rate of the brood mares (n= 5 for each animal). All the examined stallions were clinically healthy. The average of the semen volume was 74 ml, the average concentration of spermatozoids was 120 million/ml. The viability of the semen and the motility of the spermatozoids was 50 %. Only 3 stallions presented subfertility. For the assessment of <b>the</b> <b>fertility</b> in stallions it is mandatory to realize a complete clinical examination and also to test the immunity of the animal.
