40|$|<b>Biologicals</b> {{are often}} thought to {{increase}} the risk of infection. A recent review shows that the risk of serious infection in patients with rheumatoid arthritis being treated with <b>biologicals</b> (standard dose) is only mildly elevated compared with those who are treated with conventional DMARDs only (odds ratio: 1. 3). If <b>biologicals</b> are used at a lower dosage, e. g. tapering studies, the risk of serious infection {{does not seem to be}} increased. Alertness for infection in these patients, dose tapering and preventive measures such as vaccination, patient education and tuberculosis screening may potentially further reduce this serious side effect of <b>biologicals...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} the very urgent problem of optimization {{of the management}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who have achieved remission (or persistent low disease activity) during therapy using <b>biologicals.</b> It analyzes the results of BeSt, OPTIMA, HIT HARD, ACT-RAY, AVERT, PRESERVE, RETRO, PRIZE, DRESS, HOPEFUL- 2, and HONOR studies, the data of NinJa and CORRONA registries, and the experience gained in treating psoriasis concerning practically important issues, such as whether tumor necrosis factor-Î± inhibitors and <b>biologicals</b> with other mechanisms of action can be discontinued; whether the whole anti-inflammatory therapy can be stopped; whether the dose of <b>biologicals</b> can be reduced {{as an alternative to}} complete discontinuation or as a step to discontinue biologicals; whether repeated or intermittent therapy with <b>biologicals</b> can be used; what value of the depth of suppression of inflammatory activity is in solving the problem of whether <b>biologicals</b> can be discontinued. The current results may lead to the conclusion that in RA the dose of <b>biologicals</b> may be successfully reduced and, in some cases, the latter may be completely discontinued. This possibility seems {{to be associated with the}} depth of remission. Repeated use of <b>biologicals</b> generally gives rise to prompt improvement in patients with a recurrent disease-activity rebound. The results of a trial of etanercept are most optimistic. Re-treatment with <b>biologicals</b> generally provides fast improvement in patients with a relapse of disease activity. The results of the trials of etanercept are most optimistic...|$|R

5|$|<b>Biological</b> {{control is}} first {{recorded}} around 300 AD in China, when colonies of weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, were intentionally placed in citrus plantations to control beetles and caterpillars. Also in China, ducks {{were used in}} paddy fields to consume pests, as illustrated in ancient cave art. In 1762, an Indian mynah was brought to Mauritius to control locusts, and about the same time, citrus trees in Burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help control caterpillars. In the 1880s, ladybirds were used in citrus plantations in California to control scale insects, and other <b>biological</b> control experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to <b>biological</b> control experiments. By the 1960s, problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to the environment began to emerge, and <b>biological</b> control had a renaissance. Chemical pest control is still the predominant type of pest control today, although {{a renewed interest in}} traditional and <b>biological</b> pest control developed {{towards the end of the}} 20th century and continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own <b>biological</b> offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the <b>biological</b> offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the <b>biological</b> offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a direct threat to the <b>biological</b> offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the <b>biological</b> offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E
