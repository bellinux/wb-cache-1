50|$|The {{modified}} <b>Boucherie</b> <b>process</b> {{consists of}} placing freshly cut, unpeeled timbers onto declining skids, with the stump slightly elevated, then fastening watertight covering caps or boring {{a number of}} holes into the ends, and inserting a solution of copper sulfate or other waterborne preservative into the caps or holes from an elevated container. Preservative oils tend to not penetrate satisfactorily by this method. The hydrostatic pressure of the liquid forces the preservative lengthwise into and through the sapwood, thus pushing the sap out of {{the other end of}} the timber. After a few days, the sapwood is completely impregnated; unfortunately little or no penetration takes place in the heartwood. Only green wood can be treated in this manner. This process has found considerable usage to impregnate poles and also larger trees in Europe and North America, and has experienced a revival of usage to impregnate bamboo in countries such as Costa Rica, Bangladesh, India and the state of Hawaii.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} of {{laws on the}} use of biocide products has led to important changes in the field of wood preservation leading to an increasing interest for non ``biocidal treatments'' like thermal or chemical modifications. While thermal modifications become more and more common on industrial scale, development of chemical modifications progresses slowly. One reason for the challenges encountered is probably the difficulty to use actual vacuum pressure plant to impregnate wood with solutions of reactive chemicals aimed to react with or within the wood. In this context, the presented research focuses on a new alternative called axial impregnation, derived from <b>Boucherie</b> <b>process,</b> for impregnation of treatable non durable hardwood species. This process consists of low-pressure impregnation of green wood logs through its lower extremity with treatment solution transiting via natural pathways of vessels. In order to evaluate the feasibility of the method, logs of different hardwood species were impregnated with a copper based preservative solution and the distribution of copper within the wood was determined. Results indicated that treatable wood species like beech, hornbeam and birch can be easily and homogeneously treated using axial impregnation method, while ash known for its weak impregnability remained untreated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProduct form Markov {{chains are}} {{a class of}} {{compositional}} Markovian models that can be proved to benefit from a decomposed solution of the steady-state distribution (i. e. the steady-state distribution is given by {{the product of the}} components' steady-state distributions). In this paper we focus on the <b>Boucherie</b> product <b>processes,</b> a specific class of product form Continuous Time Markov Chains. We show that the compositional constraints that lead to the product form result in that class, can be exploited in the model checking problem as well, leading to a decomposed semantics for a fragment of the Continuous Stochastic Logic...|$|R
