50|$|Structural {{behaviour}} {{during an}} explosion depends {{entirely on the}} materials used {{in the construction of}} the building. Upon hitting the face of a <b>building,</b> the <b>shock</b> front from an explosion is instantly reflected. This impact with the structure imparts momentum to exterior components of the building. The associated kinetic energy of the moving components must be absorbed or dissipated in order for them to survive. Generally, this is achieved by converting the kinetic energy of the moving component to strain energy in resisting elements.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{the paper}} {{the results of}} {{calculations}} of the dynamic response of a multi-storey reinforced concrete building to a strong mining shock originated from the main region of mining activity in Poland (i. e. the Legnica-Glogow Copper District) are presented. The representative time histories of accelerations registered in three directions were used as ground motion data in calculations of the dynamic response of the structure. Two variants of a numerical model were applied: the model including only structural elements {{of the building and}} the model including both structural and non-structural elements (i. e. partition walls and ventilation ducts made of brick). It turned out that non-structural elements of multi-storey RC buildings have a small impact of about 10 % on natural frequencies of these structures. It was also proved that the dynamic response of <b>building</b> to mining <b>shock</b> obtained in case of inclusion of all non-structural elements in the numerical model is about 20 % smaller than in case of consideration of structural elements only. The principal stresses obtained in calculations of dynamic response of multi-storey building to strong mining shock are situated on the level of about 30 % of values obtained from static analysis (dead load).

40|$|Present value {{studies of}} asset market {{efficiency}} are controversial because they compare asset prices to unobserved discounted streams of future rents. As an alternative, if housing markets are efficient, then {{the price of}} residential capital or buildings should satisfy the following two conditions: (i) deviations between new building prices and construction costs should disappear faster than construction lags and {{have no effect on}} construction, and (ii) temporary <b>building</b> price <b>shocks</b> should dissipate at a similar rate for different vintage buildings. Results from an errorcorrection model support both hypotheses for single-family housing in Vancouver, British Columbia. This implies that the implicit market for residential buildings is efficient and that any inefficiencies in the housing market must lie in the market for land itself. © 1999 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R
40|$|To {{control the}} {{presence}} of Legionella in an old hospital water system, an integrated strategy of water disinfection-filtration was implemented in the university hospital Umberto I in Rome. Due to antiquated buildings, hospital water system design and hospital extension (38 <b>buildings),</b> <b>shock</b> hyperchlorination (sodium hypochlorite, 20 - 50 ppm of free chlorine at distal points for 1 - 2 h) followed by continuous hyperchlorination (0. 5 - 1. 0 mg/L at distal points) were adopted, and microbiological and chemical monitoring of the water supply {{was carried out in}} the university hospital (December 2006 -December 2011). Overall, 1308 samples of cold 45 °C (17. 8 %) water were collected, determining residual free chlorine (0. 43 ± 0. 44 mg/L), pH (7. 43 ± 0. 29) and trihalomethanes (8. 97 ± 18. 56 μg/L). Legionella was isolated in 102 (9. 8 %) out of 1. 041 water samples without filters (L. pneumophila sg 1 17. 6 %, L. pneumophila sg 2 - 14 28. 4 %, L. non pneumophila 53. 9 %), and in none of the 267 samples with filters. Legionella was recovered in 23 buildings out of 38 and 29 samples (28. 4 %) exceeded 103 cfu/L. When considering the disinfection treatment Legionella was isolated: before shock hyperchlorination (21. 1 %), 15 days after shock hyperchlorination (7. 8 %), 30 days after shock hyperchlorination (3. 5 %), during continuous hyperchlorination (5. 5 %) and without continuous hyperchlorination (27. 3 %). Continuous hyperchlorination following the shock treatment achieved > 70 % reduction of positive samples, whereas no continuous hyperchlorination after shock treatment was more frequently associated to Legionella isolation (OR 6. 41; 95 % CI 3. 10 - 13. 26; p 0. 5 < 1. 0 mg/L) deteriorated water quality (organoleptic and chemical). However, shock and continuous hyperchlorination remains a valid-term option in old buildings with no water system rational design, managing problems due to hospital extension and absence of a proper hot water recirculation system...|$|R

40|$|In {{the south}} of Germany one of the seismically most active regions {{is located in the}} Swabian Jura, called the Zollernalb. Since the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century a series of several remarkable earthquakes has started. <b>Buildings</b> are <b>shocked</b> and damaged. The centres run from south to north in several parallel lines crossing an old tectonic structure, the Hohenzollerngraben which appears as a so-called inverse relief. After the large event of 1978, the Geodetic Institute of Karlsruhe University was involved in investigations to find descriptions of the mechanism, direction and amount of the motions. In a difficult topography (woody mountains) three terrestrial geodetic networks have been established starting in 1983 covering different areas of the seismic zone. In the centre of the seismic zone the network of Onstmettingen was established consisting of 7 pillars in a distance range from 250 up to 900 m. The estimated horizontal deformation amounts to less than 0, 1 mm/a and therefore geodetic observations of very high precision were carried out. The design of the networks has been optimised concerning the topography, the tectonic pattern and the sensitivity of the deformation analysis. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{calculate}} the dissipation efficiency of relativistic reconfinement <b>shocks.</b> <b>Building</b> on previous work (Nalewajko & Sikora 2009), we consider different distributions {{of the external}} pressure. The average dissipation efficiency epsilon_diss {{is a function of}} the product of two parameters - the jet Lorentz factor Gamma_j and the reconfinement angle Theta_r, which is related to the opening angle Theta_j and the external pressure index eta. The spatial distribution of the dissipation rate strongly depends on eta. We discuss the significance of these results for the properties of relativistic jets in gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei and propose that reconfinement shocks may explain a very high dissipation efficiency of the former and a moderate dissipation efficiency of the latter. Finally, we estimate the dissipation efficiency of the reconfinement shock associated with the quasi-stationary knot HST- 1 in the jet of radio galaxy M 87 and show that it is roughly consistent with the observational constraints.

In addition to their own private assessment, they can also learn from observing other units’ decisions. Given that adjusting is costly, each unit has an incentive to delay action and wait for other players to act {{in order to make a}} better informed decision. If delay is more costly in a downturn, a negative aggregate shock can break the inertia and induce the most pessimistic agents to exit. The information released by such actions will induce more action, thus generating a burst in restructuring activities that reinforces the initial effect of the aggregate shock. This process of information accumulation and revelation offers both a powerful amplification mechanism of relatively modest aggregate shocks and a potential explanation of why restructuring tends to be concentrated in recessions. business cycle, business organization learning...|$|R

In addition to the benefits of user comfort, automated technology for buildings saves energy and, above all, it provides enhanced protection against leakage of water and hazardous gases, and against fire hazards. Lightning strikes are a natural phenomenon that poses a significant threat {{to the safety of}} buildings. The statistics of the Fire and Rescue Service of the Czech Republic show that buildings are in many cases inadequately protected against lightning strikes, or that systems have been damaged by previous strikes. A subsequent strike can occur within the period between regular inspections, which are normally made at intervals of 2 – 4 years. Over the whole of Europe, thousands of buildings are subjected to the effects of direct lightning strikes each year. This paper presents ways to carry out wireless monitoring of lightning strikes on buildings and to deal with their impact on lightning conductors.

For each of the 30 Principles, APHA also identified Specific Requirements, and the Methods of Attainment considered {{at that time to}} be the “more important means ” by which to achieve the Principle’s objectives. II. How The Principles Have Been Applied The Principles continue to inform the dialogue about, and development of policies to promote, healthy housing. For example, U. S. federal agencies endorse the Principles in the Healthy Housing Reference Manual (HH Manual). The CDC also modeled its original basic housing inspection manual after the Principles. In the U. K., the University of Warwick used the Principles as a foundational document {{in the development of the}} Health and Housing Rating System, the nation’s housing inspection system. The Principles comport with modern tenets of healthy housing, i. e. : keep housing dry, clean, ventilated, and pest free; avoid contaminants; and properly maintain housing. III. APHA’s Principles The 30 Principles fall into four categories: a. Fundamental Physiological Needs (e. g., for illumination, heat, cooling, space, chemical purity, quiet); b. Fundamental Psychological Needs (e. g., for privacy, adequate space, cleanliness, peace-of-mind, normal family and household activity); c.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis was aimed at developing a field of expertise in short wavelength lasers within the department of Physics and Astronomy at St. Andrews University. Electrical discharge pumping {{was selected as the}} excitation mechanism while the Lyman band of hydrogen was identified as the initial target for the vacuum ultraviolet work. Due to the short upper state lifetime of the laser transition (0. 8 ns), fast voltage pulse risetimes and an accurately timed, travelling electrical excitation wave matched to the speed of light in the discharge were required. Initial work succeeded in producing voltage pulses at high repetition rates having leading edges exhibiting risetimes of under 300 psec with voltage magnitudes in the 30 - 40 kV regime. This was achieved by designing and <b>building</b> non-linear ferromagnetic <b>shock</b> lines whose purpose was to sharpen the output pulse from a thyratron having a risetime of 40 - 50 ns. Voltage pulse risetime reductions on this magnitude have not been seen previously in the literature by this author. By the accurate timing of the outputs of ten such lines placed in parallel, the travelling electrical excitation wave could be created. Allied to work conducted simultaneously upon flat plate Blumlein driven hydrogen lasers, this culminated in the production and operation of a thyratron driven, sectional longitudinal hydrogen laser capable of high repetition rates. This is the first of its type of which this author is aware. Laser pulse energies of 4. 7 μJ on the 160 nm Lyman band transitions were observed while the only limitation encountered in running the laser at multi-kilohertz repetition rates in burst mode was that imposed by the charging rate of the available power supply. Despite this, 1 kHz operation of a hydrogen laser was amply demonstrated for the first time...|$|R
40|$|The last 10 {{years the}} Dutch <b>Building</b> Industry was <b>shocked</b> by several major accidents. In 2001 the steel {{structure}} of a theatre in Hoorn collapsed during erection. No one was hurt, because it collapsed during the night. In 2002 part of the parking deck of a hotel collapsed just some time after a conference beneath was finished. In 2003 5 balconies of a resident building in Maastricht broke down, 2 persons were killed[1]. Besides several buildings showed major cracks in concrete elements and were evacuated, like the bos & lommercomplex in Amsterdam (2006). The mentioned accidents received much media attention. The question arose whether these events were just incidents or indicators of a system problem in the building industry. Besides, questions on causes and measures to reduce the risks arose. A committee: “Learning from disasters” was started in 2004 with several members from building industry, government and universities. It appeared {{that there had been}} no systematic collection of failure data unlike in some other countries. In these days TNO started a database with reported accidents and TUDelft joined this initiative in 2009 to get insight in the amount and causes of structural failures. For the database TNO and TUDelft were looking for that cases from 1993 - 2008 with -an unacceptable probability of structural failure of the building or of a structural member of a building -a situation endangering people -a building less than 50 years of age -a building with loadings according to Dutch Building Code A broad definition of buildings is applied, so information on bridges, dams, temporary structures and buildings were all included. The goal {{of this paper is to}} explain how to set up and analyse a database on structural failures. Author ManuscriptStructural and Building Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA (Political Science. International Studies)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. This {{study is}} {{based on the premise that}} HIV/AIDS and {{variable}} rainfall, in other words, events such as droughts and floods (climate), are likely to be prevalent in Southern Africa for the foreseeable future. Thus, these two factors are likely to accompany future food crises in the region. This study investigates the Southern African Food Crisis in the period 2001 - 2005, with certain objectives in mind. Firstly, the impact of HIV/AIDS and climate on food security is investigated. Secondly, in light of the findings relating to the first objective, it is investigated what an optimal humanitarian intervention in a food crisis in the Southern African context, characterised by variable rainfall and high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, might entail. Finally, the appropriateness of humanitarian interventions in the Southern African Food Crisis to ameliorate the long-term impacts of HIV/AIDS and climate on the region is considered. The study makes use of an extensive literature review, supplemented by a smaller set of e-mail and semi-structured interviews. Especially with regards to the second and third research objectives, the Consortium for the Southern African Food Security Emergency (C-SAFE) is used as a case study of an intervention in the above stated context. C-SAFE – composed of a consortium of international and local non-governmental organisations - is the largest humanitarian intervention programme that was created with the specific goal of ameliorating the food crisis in the Southern African region. They were primarily active in four countries: Lesotho, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The study focuses on C-SAFE operations in these four countries in order to asses the impact of variable rainfall and HIV/Aids and other underlying causes – such as macroeconomic factors and government policy – on food insecurity in Southern Africa and to examine how these factors influence a humanitarian intervention programme such as C-SAFE. The most important findings of this study are that neither HIV/AIDS nor climate is driving food insecurity in Southern Africa. The impact of HIV/AIDS can however be devastating at household level. It is found that both factors, serve as catalysts bringing to the fore the underlying vulnerability of households. The findings of this study further suggest that interventions should provide resilience <b>building</b> to <b>shocks</b> such as drought, indicating a complex set of relief and developmental needs in the region. Furthermore, HIV/AIDS can be seen as a crisis in itself, requiring a comprehensive multisectoral response, however possibly requiring special attention in times of food insecurity. Finally it is argued that livelihoods erosion over time has meant that the work of relief agencies fulfilling their mandate, providing short-term relief to households and communities in need, regardless of the quality of such interventions, are ineffectual in addressing cycles of vulnerability in Southern Africa as inadequacies at national level, most notably a lack of government capacity, remain...|$|R
