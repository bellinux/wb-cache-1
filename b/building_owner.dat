25|$|Although the Bronx District Attorney {{said they}} were not {{responsible}} criminally, the New York City Corporation Counsel filed misdemeanor charges during February 1991 against DiLorenzo, the <b>building</b> <b>owner,</b> and Weiss, the landlord. These charges claimed that the owner and landlord were responsible for the building code violations caused by their tenant. They both pleaded guilty during May 1992, agreeing to perform community service and paying $150,000 towards a community center for Hondurans in the Bronx.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} new plan, all housing {{must include}} between 25% and 30% {{affordable}} units to qualify for the program, with several ways for builders to meet that requirement. Previously, that affordability requirement was 20%. However, if the initial tenant of the rent stabilized building decide to leave, then the <b>building</b> <b>owner</b> would no longer need to keep that specific unit rent stabilized, assuming the rent is already over $2,700 a month.|$|E

Vornado received permission from the Landmarks Preservation Commission to modify the building to create a space to accommodate two new stores on Fifth Avenue; the project called for cutting new doorways into the facade, rotating the escalators to move them {{farther away from the}} windows, and reducing the vault wall. Vornado hired the original architects, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, to make the changes. Tenants in the building at the time included Bloomberg L.P., the company of New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.|$|E

25|$|The IDeAs Z2 Design Facility is a net zero energy, {{zero carbon}} {{retrofit}} project occupied since 2007. It uses {{less than one}} fourth the energy of a typical U.S. office by applying strategies such as daylighting, radiant heating/cooling with a ground-source heat pump and high energy performance lighting and computing. The remaining energy demand is met with renewable energy from its building-integrated photovoltaic array. In 2009, <b>building</b> <b>owner</b> and occupant Integrated Design Associates (IDeAs) recorded actual measured energy use intensity of 21.17 kbtu/sf-year, with 21.72 kbtu/sf-year produced, for a net of −0.55 kbtu/sf-yr.

25|$|CAMP members {{spent several}} months researching {{the history of}} the {{building}} at San Francisco State University's Labor Archives. They followed this up with surveys to all of the Redstone Building tenants, followed by several meetings, including the first one with tenants on June 19, 1996. Working color sketches were supposed to be presented to tenants on September 3, 1996, but delayed until October 25, 1996. The sketches were then taken to the <b>Building</b> <b>owner</b> who gave permission to begin painting the murals. The initial phase of the CAMP project was made up of nine artists: Carolyn Castano, John Fadeff, Susan Greene (a Redstone tenant), Barry McGee, Ruby Neri, Sebastiani Pastor, Rigo '96, Lilly Rodriguez, Chuck Sperry and Project Director Aaron Noble. The project outreach coordinator was Mary Newson with the Lab's Laura Brun coordinating the administration of the city grant, which was part of the original $1.8 million Mission Armory Foundation money that was broken up by Mayor Brown and given to arts groups across the city.|$|E

Westmark Development at that time had Nicholas Olaerts and Thomas Harnsberger as general partners and who were owners of El Capitan Theatre by 1992. Donald Bruce Randall, an architect of the Randall/Baylon Partnership of Los Angeles, and Tehran-born Kamal Kamooneh, the project's creative architect, with Hoseyni lead the renovation costing $1.5 million to house a 250-seat cabaret, 500-seat jazz theater and an 800-person dance club. The Blue and Red Halls were restored then modified for a disc jockey's podium, special electronic and lighting equipment and bars. The bathrooms were moved to the basement to create more floor space. In September 1987, the building was renovated and reopened as the Hollywood Live Entertainment Pavilions with a cover charge for all venues. Hollywood Live lasted only a short time.|$|E

500|$|Both {{sides of}} the issue hired law firms, lobbyists, and {{business}} associates to promote their positions to city and state officials. A report by the Center City District said if both One Pennsylvania Plaza and the Cira Centre, another skyscraper in the KOZ controversy, were filled by corporations moving from other Center City office towers, the city could lose US$153 million by 2018. A report released by the group of building owners opposed to KOZ says the two buildings could cost the city almost US$91 million a year. In contrast, a report issued by a consulting company hired by Liberty Property Trust said that a KOZ designation for the skyscraper could generate US$27 million for the city. Critics of the KOZ designation also claimed that close relationships between Liberty Property Trust and Comcast and the Rendell administration were inappropriately influencing the governor's position on the issue. When Rendell was mayor of Philadelphia, David L. Cohen, a Comcast executive vice president, was Rendell's chief of staff, and William P. Hankowsky, Liberty Property Trust's chief executive, was director of Philadelphia's development agency. Rendell dismissed the claims, saying [...] "Every <b>building</b> <b>owner</b> in town was a contributor to me." ...|$|E

500|$|Knights of Pythias/Tyner Building [...] Designed by A. W. Maxwell and {{constructed}} around 1900, the building's architecture {{is a mixture}} of Romanesque, Classical, and Queen Anne, and it is located at 204–210 West Main Street. [...] (See photo herein) [...] The three-story building also has decorative limestone elements that resemble flames — possibly in tribute to the Gas Boom. [...] "K of P" [...] can be found on a western tablet, while [...] "W.H. Tyner" [...] {{can be found in the}} eastern panel. Among the offices in this Main Street building in the early 1900s were a confectioner, a doctor, and an attorney. [...] The Knights of Pythias, Fraternal Order of Eagles, and Maccabees all held meetings in this building in the early 1900s. [...] During a tumultuous period in the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had an office on the third floor of the building. Three events helped drive the Klan out of Hartford City — including one that happened in the Tyner building, and one that happened about four blocks away. First, a disturbing murder case against the state Klan leader disgusted many members. [...] (Charles E. Cox, uncle of local newsman and Cox <b>Building</b> <b>owner</b> Edward E. Cox, assisted in the prosecution of this case.) [...] Second, a safe in the Tyner Building was broken into, and the names of local Klan members were revealed. Third, violence that occurred at an event a few blocks from the courthouse caused the Hartford City mayor to order the local Klan leader out of town in 1926.|$|E
500|$|Horch, who had {{remained}} a devoted follower of the Roeriches since his acceptance of their spiritual quest {{as his own}} in 1923, [...] started to fall out with them for unclear reasons. The Roeriches maintained that Horch's motives were base: through guile and deception they said he had taken control of the Master Building, closed the cultural institutions it contained, and severed them and their associated from everything connected with the building and its contents. Horch countered that the Roeriches had improperly attempted to countermand his decisions as <b>building</b> <b>owner</b> {{and director of the}} cultural organizations it contained. He said they had shown bad faith when they asserted that they alone could receive and interpret the commands of the supreme being whom they all worshiped. On June 8, 1935, he wrote Helena Roerich to say he feared that the Roeriches had lost confidence in himself and his wife Nettie. Then, on July 13, 1935, Nettie wrote Helena of her and Horch's [...] "fourteen years of complete devotion in heart and in deed" [...] and of their enduring [...] "loyalty and selfless sacrifice" [...] over that period. She reaffirmed their [...] "flaming devotion" [...] which they continued to hold in their hearts. And she said the Roeriches' attempt to exert unilateral control over their affairs had caused them to [...] "contemplate, review and think of matters in a new light." [...] These letters explain actions that Horch took on June 5, 1936, to sever relations between the Institute and the other cultural organizations housed at the Master Building and discharge all their employees. The employees who occupied rent-free apartments were told to vacate immediately.|$|E

40|$|The multifamily {{building}} sector {{presents a}} {{unique set of}} challenges and opportunities for utilities seeking to implement effective energy efficiency programs. To deliver successful programs, utilities must understand what motivates <b>building</b> <b>owners</b> to take part in these programs, as well as barriers that may prevent participation. This paper outlines the opportunities to meet energy efficiency goals with multifamily programs. It then describes the benefits that multifamily <b>building</b> <b>owners</b> gain from these programs, and the barriers they face to participation. The paper focuses on rental housing, because these buildings are owned by a single entity and form the largest sector of the multifamily housing market. The paper provides a framework to help utilities develop successful programs that maximize energy savings and create benefits for <b>building</b> <b>owners,</b> tenants, and communities. And lastly, the paper recommends nine program design considerations that can help attract multifamily <b>building</b> <b>owners</b> to utility energy efficiency programs...|$|R

The World Trade Center itself was not rented out completely until after 1979 and then only {{due to the fact that}} the complex's subsidy by the Port Authority made rents charged for its office space relatively cheaper than that of comparable office space in other buildings.

[...] Anyone editing, printing, or circulating a newspaper or pamphlet advocating such doctrines or assisting in formation of an organization or society in support of such activities was to be subject to the law, which called for penalties of up to 10 years in prison and potential fines of up to $5,000.
