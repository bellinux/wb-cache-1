5|$|The {{second step}} is a Teach/Learn session where the {{instructor}} begins to present information <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> participants don't already know. This is usually prefixed with {{a written statement}} describing in behavioral terms the objectives that the participant will complete during the session. The instructor may utilize more advanced members to help less skilled members. The instructor often tries to elicit information from the participants' experience by asking questions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} setting, the player guides Harry Mason in an over-the-shoulder view as he {{searches}} for his missing daughter Cheryl in the snowy town of Silent Hill. Harry {{is equipped with}} a smartphone and flashlight: he can use the phone to check his location on a Global Positioning System map, take photographs, and make telephone calls. Moving to certain spots with high interference, represented by a lot of radio noise, or by taking pictures of spots where shadowy figures can be seen, unlock various text and voicemail messages that expand the story and occasionally provide clues. To view the details of various documents, the player can zoom in on objects. The game also alters details of gameplay <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> player views. Throughout his journey, Harry encounters puzzles such as mechanisms, which reward either a key required to progress or a bonus memento. In the Wii version, the Wii Remote is used for puzzle solving and to control the flashlight and cell phone.|$|E

Today, this personalization is not performed <b>based</b> directly <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> user actually perceives, but on a hearing-care professional’s interpretation of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> user explains about what is perceived. In this paper, an interactive personalization system <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Gaussian process regression and active learning is proposed, which personalize the hearing aids <b>based</b> directly <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> user perceives.

25|$|A-League {{clubs are}} {{eligible}} {{for participation in the}} AFC Champions League competition each season since the 2007 edition of the tournament. These teams were determined by finishing positions in the 2005–06 A-League season, the 2008 competition by finishing positions in the 2006–07 season, and so on. The amount of qualification slots and their nature as direct entry to the group stage or a qualification play-off varies <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> AFC determines for each nation in the competition for that season. Until 2012, for most seasons there were two direct entry positions. Originally the first qualification slot was given to the regular season winning club, with the second to the Grand Final winning club. Due to the dates of the respective competitions, an entire season passes before clubs compete. For example, Newcastle Jets competed in the 2009 AFC Champions League, even though they finished last in the 2008–09 A-League season.|$|E

Murano's condos range between [...] and [...] and were designed to be loft-like with each featuring a balcony. The building features ground level retail space and an adjacent parking garage. Located in the West Market Street neighborhood of Center City, a neighborhood that first saw residential development in 2002, the building struggled to fill its units during the late-2000s recession. In July 2009 the Murano's owners held a successful auction on forty of the building's units. Thomas Properties Group lowered the price for the remaining unsold units <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> forty units went for at the auction.|$|E

Zur cited [...] game director Todd Howard and the sound designer Mark Lambert, for helping him to manage the in-game sound implementation, claiming his own merit for only 50%. Zur also admitted that he conceived the soundtrack <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> player would perceive on psychological level, rather than on what the player would see on the screen, so placing the listener musically ahead over {{the environment in which}} he moves. Apart from a few exceptions, Inon Zur said that the soundtrack of the game was mainly composed using a sampler.|$|E

The design was further defined in the CPC Constitution in 1996. The flag has a red background that is charged with the emblem of the CPC in gold at the top left corner. The flag ratio is defined as two by three (24×36 units); {{the size of the}} emblem is eight units square, placed four units away from the hoist and three units away {{from the top of the}} flag.|$|E

Her family returned to the United States at the outbreak of World War II and settled in Wilmington, Delaware. Although aware of her attraction to other girls, Gittings said she first heard the word [...] "homosexual" [...] when she was rejected for membership in the National Honor Society in high school.

500|$|The piece-rate {{approach}} to wages {{had been introduced}} in the first Five-Year Plan in 1928 and had changed very little since then. In practice the piece-rate system led to many inefficiencies in Soviet industry. One issue was the vast bureaucracy that was involved in administering wage payments. Each Soviet ministry or government department would set its own rates and wage scales for work in the factories or enterprises {{for which they were}} responsible. Within one ministry there could be great variation in pay rates for jobs requiring largely identical responsibilities and skills, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> factory was producing, the location of the factory and other factors that Moscow considered important. Basing payments on these central directives often led to long and costly processes in the calculation of wages. Historian Donald Filtzer wrote of one 1930s machinist who in one month completed 1,424 individual pieces of work. Amongst these had been 484 differing tasks, all of which had been assigned a basic individual payment rate of between 3 and 50 kopeks each (1 ruble was equal to 100 kopeks). To calculate this worker's wage, his employer had to process 2,885 documents which had required some 8,500 signatures on [...] of paper, costing the factory 309 rubles, a fifth of what they would pay the worker, whose total earnings for the labour amounted to 1,389 rubles.|$|E
500|$|The song {{list for}} World Tour started as {{the list of}} songs that Neversoft wanted to include in Guitar Hero III, but had failed {{to get into the}} game or as {{downloadable}} content; the list was eventually expanded to over 500 songs. [...] The song list was then prioritized <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> team thought would be best in the game, and then going after the music that would take the longest time to license, as was the case for the Jimi Hendrix songs. [...] While songs were selected to make sure that guitar, bass, and drums all had great parts, they also opted for songs that would be strong for one single instrument as to make the game still appealing for those playing the single player modes. [...] Some songs were also suggested through the licensing efforts by Activision for inclusion in the game. [...] Flores stated that the inclusion of caricatures of recording artists in the game was either due to the team seeking that specific artist for the game, or the artist approaching the development team and requesting to be part of it. The band Tool, which hasn't licensed its music since 1996, allowed for the inclusion of three of its songs in World Tour as long they were involved with the artwork and tracking of the songs for the game, leading {{to the creation of the}} art-like Tool venue.|$|E
2500|$|Carbon {{credits and}} carbon taxes each have their {{advantages}} and disadvantages. Credits were {{chosen by the}} signatories to the Kyoto Protocol {{as an alternative to}} Carbon taxes. A criticism of tax-raising schemes is that they are frequently not hypothecated, and so {{some or all of the}} taxation raised by a government would be applied <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> particular nation's government deems most fitting. [...] However, some would argue that carbon trading is based around creating a lucrative artificial market, and, handled by free market enterprises as it is, carbon trading is not necessarily a focused or easily regulated solution.|$|E

They had forty oars on each side, carried three to four guns, had a sharp-pointed keel and a flat deck and were thus safe against storms and high waves. Moreover, the crew was protected by breastwork and therefore {{had no need to}} fear arrows and stones. There were two hundred men altogether, with many pulling the oars, which made these ships very fast, even if there was no wind. When the guns were fired and the gun balls poured like rain, no enemy could resist. These ships were called wugongchuan." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Gallic Wars, the Belgic area {{south of}} the Oude Rijn and west of the Rhine was conquered by Roman forces under Julius Caesar {{in a series of}} campaigns from 57 BC to 53 BC. The tribes located {{in the area of the}} Netherlands at this time did not leave behind written records, so all the {{information}} known about them during this pre-Roman period is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Romans and Greeks wrote about them. One of the most important is Caesar's own Commentarii de Bello Gallico. Two main tribes he described as living in what is now the Netherlands were the Menapii, and the Eburones, both in the south, which is where Caesar was active. He established the principle that the Rhine defined a natural boundary between Gaul and Germania magna. But the Rhine was not a strong border, and he made it clear that there was a part of Belgic Gaul where many of the local tribes (including the Eburones) were [...] "Germani cisrhenani", or in other cases, of mixed origin.|$|E
2500|$|The cost-price of new output was {{not based}} on a {{hypothetical}} [...] "labor-value" [...] of inputs, but <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> producers actually paid for the inputs that were used up to create their outputs. The difference between the selling price and the cost price of the new output sold, was the surplus value realized as profit by the producer of that output, and the argument was, that this profit would normally (assuming ordinary competition) tend to gravitate to an amount reflecting the average profit rate on capital. If businesses could not reach a baseline profitability, they would be driven out of business sooner or later, or they would {{be taken over by}} another business and restructured, so that they did become sufficiently profitable. Inversely, if businesses overcharged for their commodities to obtain more profit, fewer people would buy them, and they would suffer decline as well. Marx then examined what the division of the total newly produced surplus value would be, among producers with varying capital compositions, on the assumption of a uniform profit rate established by free competition.|$|E
