40|$|<b>Barrier</b> <b>films</b> are {{required}} {{for a number of}} applications such as food packaging or organic electronics to prevent product degradation results from exposure to water vapour and oxygen. In order to determine the effectiveness of polymers and deposited <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> to inhibit water permeation, the water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) needs to be measured. The calcium test, MOCON instrument and tritiated water permeation can all be used to determine the WVTR, but the values produced by these techniques have not been extensively compared. The WVTR of two polymer substrates and two <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> deposited onto polymer substrates have been measured using these three techniques. For a polyethylene terephthalate substrate and a MOCON reference film, similar WVTR were observed for all three techniques. For two commercially available <b>barrier</b> <b>films,</b> variable WVTRs were observed and attributed to film defects. WVTR measurements play an essential role in the use of polymers and <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> to retard water permeation, therefore an understanding of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each technique is of great importance...|$|R

Three {{different}} fiber-reinforced composite test laminates were laid up using carbon-, glass-, and Kevlar-reinforced epoxy prepregs, and then four different hydrophobic <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> were placed as the out-of-most ply (last ply) {{on top of the}} test laminates. The prepared samples were co-cured through an autoclave per recommended cure cycles. These hydrophobic <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> included polyether ether ketone or PEEK (12. 7 - and 25. 4 -mu m thicknesses), polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon (25. 4 mu m), and polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) or Tedlar (25. 4 mu m). Tedlar films have been the only source used for moisture prevention in Aerospace composites, so {{the purpose of the present}} study was to determine other alternatives and their moisture ingression prevention characteristics. The tape adhesion tests conducted on the <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> of the composite panels indicated that PEEK and Tedlar films were well bonded on the composite surfaces, while Teflon films failed the tape adhesion tests. The laminate composites that were co-bonded with <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> were immersed in water up to 29 days, and then 3 -point bend tests were conducted on each sample before and after immersion. Test results show that 25. 4 -mu m thick PEEK and Tedlar films on the carbon, glass, and Kevlar laminate composites provided similar mechanical properties. Also, the laminates incorporated with <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> exhibited significantly higher mechanical properties when compared to the same laminates without any <b>barrier</b> <b>films.</b> This study indicated that these <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> considerably reduced moisture ingression into the laminate composite structures, which may be useful for applications in composite aircraft and wind turbines.

Separating certain materials from the display section of an exhibition case by lining relevant surfaces with an impermeable <b>barrier</b> <b>film</b> will help protect items from damage. Any fabrics that line or decorate the case (e.g. polyester blend fabric), and any adhesives used in the process, should also be tested to determine any risk. Using internal buffers and pollutant absorbers, such as silica gel, activated carbon, or zeolite, {{is a good way}} to control relative humidity and pollutants. Buffers and absorbers should be placed out of sight, in the base or behind the backboard of a case. If the case is to be painted, it is recommended oil paints be avoided; acrylic or latex paint is preferable.|$|E
50|$|Bubble wrap is {{most often}} formed from {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) film with a shaped side bonded to a flat side to form air bubbles. Some types of bubble wrap have a lower permeation <b>barrier</b> <b>film</b> to allow longer useful life and resistance to loss of air in vacuums. The bubbles can be as small as 6 millimeters (1/4 inch) in diameter, to as large as 26 millimeters (1 inch) or more, to provide added levels of shock absorption during transit. The most common bubble size is 1 centimeter. In addition {{to the degree of}} protection available from the size of the air bubbles in the plastic, the plastic material itself can offer some forms of protection for the object in question. For example, when shipping sensitive electronic parts and components, a type of bubble wrap is used that employs an anti-static plastic that dissipates static charge, thereby protecting the sensitive electronic chips from static which can damage them.|$|E

[...] Field Museum curators developed standards and best practices for the care of collections. [...] Conservators at the Field Museum have made notable contributions to the preservation of artifacts including the use of pheromone trapping for control of webbing clothes moths.In a modern collections-bearing institution, {{the vast majority of the}} scientific specimens and artifact are stored in specially designed collection cabinets, placed in containers made of archival materials, with labels printed on acid-free paper, and specimens and artifact are stored away from natural light to avoid fading. Preservation fluids are continuously monitored and in many collections humidity and temperature are controlled to ensure the long-term preservation of the specimens and artifacts. Field Museum was an early adopter of positive-pressure based approaches to control of environment in display cases, using control modules for humidity control in several galleries where room-level humidification was not practical. [...] The museum has also adopted a low-energy approach to maintain low humidity to prevent corrosion in archaeological metals using ultra-well-sealed <b>barrier</b> <b>film</b> micro-environments. [...] Other notable contributions include methods for dyeing Japanese papers to color match restorations in organic substrates, [...] the removal of display mounts from historic objects, [...] testing of collections for residual heavy metal pesticides, [...] presence of early plastics in collections, [...] the effect of sulfurous products in display cases, [...] and the use of light tubes in display cases.Concordant with research developments, new collection types, such as frozen tissue collections, requiring new collecting and preservation techniques are added to the existing holdings.|$|E

The new <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> are conformal and exhibit good barrier performance for Al metallization.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{coefficient}} of friction (CoF) of skin against fabric when the skin {{is covered with a}} liquid <b>barrier</b> <b>film</b> versus a silicone dressing, relative to a bare skin baseline. Approach: A laboratory instrument allowing the measurement of friction be-tween two surfaces was used to compare the CoF between a fabric re-presenting bed linen (100 % cotton) and the skin of two laboratory operators, either bare (dry or hydrated) or covered with a liquid <b>barrier</b> <b>film</b> or a silicone dressing. Results: The CoF of hydrated skin was over twice the value found for dry skin. The liquid <b>barrier</b> <b>film</b> product reduced the CoF of hydrated skin {{to a greater extent than}} the silicone dressing.

We found that a liquid <b>barrier</b> <b>film</b> provided a greater reduction in the CoF of skin against linen than a silicone dressing.
