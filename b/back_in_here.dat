500|$|Following Pakistan, Boycott and the England team {{travelled}} to New Zealand. England {{were defeated}} in the opening Test {{for the first time}} in 48 years. Boycott took seven hours and 22 minutes to score 77 runs, and England were bowled out for 64 when chasing 137 to win. In the second match, Botham's first Test century took England to 418, but by the end of the match England needed to score quickly to force a win. Boycott, however, told his team that he would play the way he always had, and proceeded to accumulate runs very slowly. Derek Randall was run out, and Botham went out to bat with his captain, informing the dressing room that [...] "Boycs will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> before the end of the over." [...] Botham then ran Boycott out, later claiming in his autobiography that he had done it deliberately. Indeed, some have suggested that this was a team order. Boycott disputes the suggestion that the run-out was deliberate in his autobiography, referring to Botham's account as [...] "a story that gets bigger and more fanciful with every telling". The tale does nevertheless remain a renowned story. Boycott then delayed his declaration, much to the frustration of England bowler Bob Willis. England did eventually declare, and Willis took 4/14. New Zealand were bowled out for 105 and England won by 174 runs. Boycott suffered a scratch on his cornea and missed the last two days of the final match, and by the start of the 1978 season, Brearley had taken the captaincy back from Boycott.|$|E

[...] "Everything went according to plan and we had some decent speed in race trim. We're excited and hopefully, we can see that speed again tomorrow night." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{factor that}} damaged {{wetlands}} was large scale logging, particularly the extensive logging of cypress {{forests in the}} early 1900s. [...] One early logger described it this way: [...] "We just use the old method of going in and cutting down the swamp and tearing it up and bringing the cypress out. When a man's in here with all the heavy equipment, {{he might as well}} cut everything he can make a board foot out of; we're not ever coming <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> again" [...] This logging often required construction of canals, which, once the logging was finished, allowed salt water to enter the wetlands and prevent regeneration of the cypress.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Ben assumed major {{leadership}} responsibilities as the Chairman of the Durham Housing Authority. Directing {{a group of}} 21 neighborhood councils, Ruffin worked to improve housing, employment and neighborhoods in Durham. This project promised greater opportunities and improved living conditions for Durham’s black residents as many were restricted to substandard housing and the [...] "slum life". When Ruffin learned that builders weren’t putting adequate insulation and firewalls into houses, he went to building sites and stated, “I asked for nice homes for my people and you’re not going to just throw anything together, you’re going to come <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> and do these walls.” The builders then corrected their methods, and the houses were built to code.|$|E

5000|$|Taking a {{cue from}} other comic talents of the era, most of their humor was {{directed}} inward, towards themselves. In several notable exchanges recorded on the live album At the Country Club, they intone that the parade to be given by their fan club had to be canceled {{because one of the}} members was ill, and the other had to work. The implication of course being that there were only two members of such a club. Indeed, from the opening introduction, by Hee Haw stalwart Archie Campbell the humor is towards them, rather than at others. Campbell's intro noted, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control, the next act showed up." [...] At one point in the evening, Burns remarked to one of the patrons, [...] "Hey, you walking out! Get <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> you're no better than the rest of them." [...] However, taking a moment to imprint their serious musical talent, they and {{the other members of the}} band perform [...] "C-Jam Blues", to the delight of the audience.|$|E
