25|$|In 1924 the Liberal {{party had}} only <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up 343 {{candidates}} {{due to lack}} of money. At one point the Liberal Shadow Cabinet suggested obtaining the opinion of a Chancery Lawyer as to whether the Liberal Party was entitled under trust law to Lloyd George's money, which he had obtained from the sale of honours. On 29 January 1925, at a two-day London convention, Asquith launched a Million Fund Appeal in an unsuccessful attempt to raise Liberal Party funds independent of Lloyd George.|$|E
500|$|The {{prosecution}} called 64 separate witnesses. Essone, Mbene, and Aubame {{claimed that}} {{their involvement in}} the coup was {{due to a lack}} of development in the Gabonese army. [...] Judge Leon Auge, the judge in the case, said that if [...] "that is the only reason for your coup d'état, you deserve a severe penalty." [...] Essone said that almost all Gabonese military officers knew of an imminent coup beforehand, while Aubame affirmed his position that he did not participate in its planning. According to him, he formed the provisional government in a constitutional manner, and at the request of some [...] "putschists". He reasoned that the French intervention was effectively an illegal act of interference, an assertion which Gondjout and the former education minister, Jean Marc Ekoh, shared. Ekoh had served as Foreign Minister during the coup. The Gabonese actor said that it should be the French troops being tried, not he and his comrades: [...] "If we'd <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up a few more Gabonese soldiers against the French, we'd have won— and we shouldn't be here today." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Northrup did {{not speak}} out {{publicly}} against her ex-husband following their divorce, she broke her silence in 1972. She wrote privately to Paulette Cooper, {{the author of the}} book The Scandal of Scientology who was subsequently targeted by the Church's Operation Freakout. Northrup told Cooper that Hubbard was a dangerous lunatic, and that although her own life had been transformed when she left him, she was still afraid both of him and of his followers, whom she later described as looking [...] "like Mormons, but with bad complexions." [...] In July 1986 she was interviewed by the ex-Scientologist Bent Corydon several months after Hubbard's death, which had reduced her fear of retaliation. Excerpts from the interview were published in Corydon's 1987 book, [...] She died of breast cancer in 1997 but in the last few months of her life she dictated a tape-recorded account of her relationship with Hubbard. It is now in the Stephen A. Kent Collection on Alternative Religions at the University of Alberta. Rejecting any suggestion that she was some kind of [...] "pathetic person who has suffered through the years because of my time with Ron", Northrup spoke of her relief that she had <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it behind her. She stated that she was [...] "not interested in revenge; I'm interested in the truth" ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show (roughly 8 years), Monk overcomes many of his phobias and some aspects of his OCD. Though he hasn't been cured of many of them, if any at all, he has <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them {{in the back of his}} mind when {{involved}} in case work. His most notable breakthrough is shown in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy", when Adrian is locked in a car trunk with his fellow OCD patient and personal rival, Harold Krenshaw. During the terrifying trip, both men overcome their longstanding case of claustrophobia (fear of small spaces), as well as their own differences, resulting in them becoming friends. Possibly due to this, as well as the many cases Monk has solved over the years, he is reinstated as detective first class by Stottlemeyer in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Badge". Though he is very excited about his reinstatement initially, Monk realizes that becoming a detective again didn't mean that he would be happier. In a session with Dr. Bell, Monk realizes he was always happy as a private detective and consultant to the SFPD as his own boss. After overcoming his fear of heights and singlehandedly capturing a killer window-washer, Monk turns in his badge. In the series finale, he learns that his late wife, Trudy, had given birth to a daughter before they had met. The knowledge and events of the episode lead to positive changes in his personality.|$|E

2500|$|Jack Straw (then Home Secretary) stated to the British Parliament in 1999: [...] "In 1992, after Mr. Mitrokhin had {{approached}} the UK for help, our Secret Intelligence Service made arrangements to bring Mr. Mitrokhin {{and his family}} to this country, together with his archive. As there were no original KGB documents or copies of original documents, the material itself was of no direct evidential value, but it was of huge value for intelligence and investigative purposes. Thousands of leads from Mr. Mitrokhin's material have been followed up worldwide. As a result, our intelligence and security agencies, in co-operation with allied Governments, have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a stop to many security threats. Many unsolved investigations have been closed; many earlier suspicions confirmed; and some names and reputations have been cleared. Our intelligence and security agencies have assessed the value of Mr. Mitrokhin's material world wide as immense." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was ranked}} {{as the top}} East Yokozuna on the May banzuke, {{the first time a}} Japanese wrestler has held the highest {{position}} since Takanohana in July 2001. He withdrew from the tournament on Day 11 having lost four matches, due to his failure to recover from his upper body injuries and inability to use his left arm properly. Nishiiwa Oyakata, a coach at Tagonoura stable, said that Kisenosato had suffered from a lack of preparation time. [...] "He only had about a week to practice against wrestlers before the meet. You would usually train for about a month after healing from injury, so I wish he had more time. I hope {{he will be able to}} live up to fans’ expectations at the Nagoya basho." [...] The only previous time Kisenosato has withdrawn from a tournament in his 15-year career was the final day of the January 2014 tournament. Kisenosato declared himself fit for the July tournament but lost to Mitakeumi on the opening day and Tochinoshin on Day 3. He then withdrew from the tournament on Day 6 after suffering a left ankle ligament injury in his defeat the previous day to Ikioi. His stablemaster said, [...] "The pain in his left arm seems to be gone but he hasn't <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on good sumo." [...] He began full training for the Aki basho with 13 practice bouts with Yago of the jūryō division on September 4, but admitted he [...] "had a long way to go." [...] Shibatayama Oyakata commented, [...] "He is not in a condition to engage in bouts at a sumo tournament. I felt that he was just testing how much he has recovered from his injuries." [...] On September 7 Kisenosato's stablemaster confirmed that he would sit out the tournament, saying [...] "it takes courage to rest, and I hope this break will turn things in the right direction." ...|$|E
