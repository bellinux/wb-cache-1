50|$|Varmint rifle bullets {{with thin}} jackets are {{intended}} to expand rapidly and disintegrate upon encountering minimum resistance. Bullets intended for big-game hunting are designed to increase their forward diameter while remaining intact to penetrate deeply enough to damage internal organs likely to cause rapid death. Big-game bullets sometimes have a specialized jacket including a center baffle between a forward core intended to expand and another core intended to remain intact. Alternative designs include a jacket with an internally thicker belt around {{the central part of}} the bullet intended to resist expansion while the thinner forward part of the bullet jacket ruptures. Some bullets have a core formed from a soft alloy in the forward part of the <b>bullet</b> <b>bonded</b> to a harder alloy core in the rear of the bullet. Others have a jacket which is thicker near the base of the bullet and tapers to a thin fringe adjacent to the soft point.|$|R
50|$|Some {{corporate}} bonds have an embedded call option {{that allows the}} issuer to redeem the debt before its maturity date. These are called callable bonds. A less common feature is an embedded put option that allows investors to put the bond back to the issuer before its maturity date. These are called putable bonds. Both of these features are common to the High Yield market. High Grade bonds rarely have embedded options. A straight bond that is neither callable nor putable is called a <b>bullet</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the case for}} mortgage covered bonds {{as an alternative to}} the originate-to-distribute mortgage funding model. It argues that the economic incentives provided to market participants under the covered bonds model are less susceptible to moral hazard even while retaining the key benefits of securitization such as capital market funding and flexibility in risk allocation. Notwithstanding these advantages, however, limited market size and the greater pro-cyclicality of mortgage loan quality in the United States - potentially reflecting borrower incentives under the personal bankruptcy framework - impose limits on the benefits ensuing from this model. The analysis underscores the need for a comprehensive legal-regulatory framework to underpin market development and discusses a number of ways in which the current draft legislation may be further strengthened. A potential strategy to hasten market development within the current institutional framework is identified.

40|$|This paper {{sets forth}} some basic {{principles}} {{that could help}} debt managers in emerging market and other countries to plan and implement sovereign debt buyback and swap operations. It discusses the macroeconomic context in which buybacks and swaps are undertaken, the objectives of buybacks and swaps, the analytical framework for deciding whether to undertake a particular buyback or swap operation and for selecting among alternative operations, and some key issues in {{the determination of the}} strategy for executing buybacks and swaps. The focus is on developing the analytical framework for evaluating sovereign debt buyback and swap operations, since very little work has been done in this area. In this regard, the paper presents a step-wise decision-making procedure, in which discounted cash flow analysis and the use of strategic benchmarks for the debt play central roles.

500|$|In London, {{a golden}} <b>bullet</b> with James <b>Bond's</b> code [...] "007" [...] etched into its surface is {{received}} by MI6.

5000|$|Bullet {{choice when}} {{reloading}} is critical, as bullet velocity at close ranges {{may result in}} less robust bullets disintegrating without providing significant penetration on especially tough game. Thus one {{would do well to}} use a premium bullet of some sort, for instance a <b>bonded</b> <b>bullet.</b> The choice of barrel length is also critical, as a 26 or 27 in barrel is commonly needed to achieve the full velocity potential of the cartridge, and a 24 in barrel should be viewed as a practical minimum. This is because in shorter, i.e., sporter, barrels, of approximately 22 in, the cartridge ballistics deteriorate to much the same as those achieved in a [...]270 Winchester, while generating more recoil and muzzle blast than the [...]270 Winchester.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1973 action film, Joe Bullet, Gampu was {{featured}} in the lead role playing {{the part of a}} strong action man, Joe Bullet. The character was described by The Guardian as being modeled on something between Shaft and James <b>Bond.</b> <b>Bullet</b> drunk alcohol, drove sports cars, did karate, throws knives and climbs up mineshafts. It was independently released in 1973, and it played at the Eyethu cinema in Soweto. It was screened twice then the film was banned. [...] This was done because the South African government at the time were concerned how it may influence the aspirations of black South Africans. For about 40 years the original film reels were stored in a box in the back of producer Tonie van der Merwe's garage gathering dust. He hung on to the reels during the course of 40 years. Channel24.co.za announced on Jan 24, 2017, that after 44 years of absence, the film was to be screened at the The Bioscope Independent Cinema in Johannesburg on January 24th and at The Company Gardens in Cape Town on January 25th.|$|R
40|$|Many {{financial}} institutions voluntarily undertake additional interest rate exposure, {{due to their}} shortterm funding and the placements of their assets in longer term bonds. Based on realised total bond returns of the major bond markets this paper assesses whether a fixed-income investor is actually rewarded by taking this additional interest rate risk. Unfortunately, the question raised {{in the title of}} this article can not clearly be answered. The outcome of the empirical analysis has shown that returns, return volatilities and their correlations are time-varying. However, some investment policy implications and conclusions can be stated, but caution is warranted when interpreting the empirical findings. When various bullet-portfolio strategies are observed a concave (excess) risk/return trade-off pattern can be found. This implies that the efficiency of duration extension is limited. The major government bond and US agency markets do reward interest rate risk, but (excess) returns do not increase linearly with return volatility. Generally, the reward for taking additional interest rate risk is the highest at {{the front end of the}} curve, and diminishes as the slope of the excess returns curve flattens from the one-to-threeyear part of the curve. In other words, if a fixed-income investor wanted to obtain higher excess returns by taking more interest rate risk during this long sample period, he should have invested (more) in bonds up to a maturity of approximately two years. Interestingly, the observed excess risk/return trade-off is unstable over time. Different risk/reward patterns that hold across periods are found, and seem to be dependent on macro-economic business cycles. In a bearish interest rate climate, taking additional interest rate risk is not rewarded at all. In these circumstances, a fixed-income investor has a strong incentive to lower the long-run benchmark duration. In addition, it should be noticed that long-duration bonds may be good investments for investors with longduration liabilities. Finally, based on historical interdependencies a fixed-income investor can improve the risk/return characteristics of a <b>bullet</b> treasury <b>bond</b> portfolio with a given interest rate exposure, by allocating the interest rate exposure across maturities and/or international government bond markets. The inclusion of US agency bonds in a US treasury portfolio also improved the risk/return characteristics of the overall portfolio, but to a much lesser extent...|$|R
