5|$|A more {{traditional}} Serbian nightlife experience, accompanied <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> music known as Starogradska (roughly translated as Old Town Music), typical of northern Serbia's urban environments, is most prominent in Skadarlija, the city's old bohemian neighborhood where the poets and artists of Belgrade {{gathered in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. Skadar Street (the centre of Skadarlija) and the surrounding neighbourhood are lined with some of Belgrade's best and oldest traditional restaurants (called kafanas in Serbian), which date back to that period. At {{one end of the}} neighbourhood stands Belgrade's oldest beer brewery, founded {{in the first half of}} the 19th century. One of the city's oldest kafanas is the Znak pitanja("?").|$|E
5|$|According to Pāṇini, a 6th-century BCE Sanskrit grammarian, {{the term}} yoga {{can be derived}} from either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau (to concentrate). In the context of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, the root yuj samādhau (to concentrate) is {{considered}} <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> commentators as the correct etymology. In accordance with Pāṇini, Vyasa who wrote the first commentary on the Yoga Sutras, states that yoga means samādhi (concentration).|$|E
5|$|After the {{commercial}} success of Shaolin Soccer, its production company, Star Overseas, {{began to develop}} Kung Fu Hustle with Columbia Pictures Asia in 2002. The film features a number of retired actors famous for 1970s Hong Kong action cinema, yet {{has been compared to}} contemporary and influential martial arts films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero. The cartoon style of the film, accompanied <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> Chinese music, is often cited as its most striking feature.|$|E

5|$|As the Laws were {{formulated}} in England, and were initially administered solely {{by the four}} British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.|$|E
5|$|Dig Me Out is {{the third}} studio album by the American rock band Sleater-Kinney, {{released}} on April 8, 1997, by Kill Rock Stars. The album was produced by John Goodmanson and recorded from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. Dig Me Out marked the debut of Janet Weiss, who is the band's longest serving and current drummer. The music on the record was influenced <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> rock and roll bands, while the lyrics deal with issues of heartbreak and survival. The album cover is an homage to The Kinks' 1965 album The Kink Kontroversy.|$|E
5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E

5|$|Ernest C. Wong of Site Design Group {{designed}} the park. Having designed landscape along Chinatown's Cermak Avenue, Wong {{was familiar with}} the community and invited the public to voice their opinions and ideas for the future park. The park's original design called for walled plazas inspired <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> Chinese gardens in Suzhou, China. This design was scrapped, however, because of security and vandalism concerns. Instead, a system of pathways was created to link defined spaces and mimic courtyards.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{campaigns are}} {{generally}} considered to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender neutrality in English, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including bell hooks, argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims because men are also harmed <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> gender roles.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{consumed}} fresh, {{or may be}} preserved <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> methods, which include combinations of drying, smoking, and salting, or fermentation. Modern methods of preservation include freezing, freeze-drying, and heat processing (as in canning). Frozen fish products include breaded or battered fillets, fish fingers and fishcakes. Fish meal {{is used as a}} food supplement for farmed fish and for livestock. Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of oily fish such as sardine and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.|$|E

5|$|In February 2013, Christophe Beck {{was hired}} to score the film, {{following}} his work on Paperman, a Disney animated short film released the year prior to Frozen. It was revealed on September 14, 2013, that Sámi musician Frode Fjellheim's Eatnemen Vuelie would be the film's opening song, as it contains elements of the traditional Sámi singing style joik. The music producers recruited a Norwegian linguist {{to assist with the}} lyrics for an Old Norse song written for Elsa's coronation and traveled to Trondheim, Norway, to record the all-female choir Cantus, for a piece inspired <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> Sámi music.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} economy, the lower social classes also had to {{be integrated into the}} new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking answers to these questions was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> Spanish law.|$|E

5|$|The Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority (RTA) {{operates}} public bus {{routes in}} the Dayton metro area. In addition to routes covered <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> diesel-powered buses, RTA {{has a number}} of electric trolley bus routes. The Dayton trolleybus system is the second longest-running of the six remaining trolleybus systems in the U.S., having entered service in 1933. It is the present manifestation of an electric transit service that has operated continuously in Dayton since 1888.|$|E
5|$|The Sardinian cheese casu marzu {{is exposed}} to flies known as cheese skippers such as Piophila casei, {{members of the family}} Piophilidae. The {{digestive}} activities of the fly larvae soften the cheese and modify the aroma as {{part of the process of}} maturation. At one time European Union authorities banned sale of the cheese and it was becoming hard to find, but the ban has been lifted on the grounds that the cheese is a traditional local product made <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> methods.|$|E
5|$|The huia {{was found}} {{throughout}} the North Island before humans arrived in New Zealand. The Māori are estimated to have arrived around 800 years ago, and {{by the arrival of}} European settlers in the 1840s, habitat destruction and hunting had reduced the bird's range to the southern North Island. However, Māori hunting pressures on the huia were limited to some extent <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> protocols. The hunting season was from May to July when the bird's plumage was in prime condition, while a rāhui (hunting ban) was enforced in spring and summer. It was not until European settlement that the huia's numbers began to decline severely, due mainly to two well-documented factors: widespread deforestation and over hunting.|$|E

5|$|The semi-natural, unfertilized {{pastures}} formed <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> {{agricultural methods}} in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing. Because the ecological {{impact of this}} land management strategy {{is similar to the}} impact of such natural disturbances as a wildfire, this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a natural habitat, including the promotion of biodiversity. This strategy is declining in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline.|$|E
5|$|Devotees {{visit the}} temple {{to attend the}} daily pujas and make their offerings. Booths are erected outside {{for the sale of}} food, drink, brassware, pottery, cloth and holy images. On the {{penultimate}} day of the festival there is a procession, when the image of the goddess is placed upon a huge wooden chariot and pulled around the temple by devotees. On {{the final day of the}} festival, two large chariots are drawn by the devotees to the Deduru oya, a local river for the thirtham ("holy bath") ceremony when the images are dipped into the river. At the same time thousands of devotees also jump into the river. After the holy bath, the procession goes back to the temple along a route through Chilaw, accompanied <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> Nadeswaram and Thavil musicians. The procession then passes the Ayyanayake and Kali temples prior to entering the main temple.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1962, Tatsunoko Production {{celebrated their}} 40th year of {{animated}} film production by releasing Karas in 2005, their first production being Space Ace in 1965. Keiichi Sato {{joined the company}} as the project director after he pitched its concept of a life-sized dark hero to the management. He researched production and direction techniques from kabuki, a form of traditional Japanese theater; and Japanese staged sword fights as materials for the project. Choreographed sword fights rendered with 3D animation were rare at that time, and Sato felt this would help distinguish the show. The use of theatrical elements and movie shooting techniques in its presentation sets Karas apart from its contemporaries. Producer Kenji Nakamura felt the team's lack of experience in this area pushed them to ignore their previous animation work experience and break free of restrictions influenced <b>by</b> <b>traditional</b> animation production.|$|E
