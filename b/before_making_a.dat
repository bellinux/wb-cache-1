It briefly restrengthened in the warm waters of the bay <b>before</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> second landfall in Veracruz. Dean progressed to the northwest, weakening into a remnant low which finally dissipated over the southwestern United States.|$|E

5|$|A non-tropical area of low pressure, first noted {{over the}} Gulf Stream on August7, entered the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and {{organized}} into a tropical depression about 120mi (190km) west of Fort Myers, Florida, by 18:00UTC on August10. As {{the newly formed}} cyclone moved west-northwest, a nearby upper-level low imparted high wind shear and dry air entrainment, and the depression degenerated into a remnant low twelve hours later without attaining tropical storm intensity. Upon degeneration, the low moved into the Gulf Coast of the United States and conducted a clockwise loop. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico again on August16, where the disturbance nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone <b>before</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> second landfall in Mississippi the next day. The remnants dissipated over the southeastern portion of the state on August18.|$|E

5|$|A {{storm of}} {{potentially}} Cape Verde origin was {{detected in the}} Virgin Islands at 1800UTC on August5. Initially moving westward, the tropical storm gradually gained in intensity <b>before</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> sharp curve towards the north on August8. The storm continued in a northerly motion before a second curvature brought it in a generally westward direction on August9. Shortly after, the tropical storm reached hurricane intensity as a modern-day Category1hurricane. The hurricane eventually made landfall at peak intensity on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina at 2030UTC on September21. At the time, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 100mph (155km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71inHg), equivalent to a modern-day Category2hurricane. Once inland, the tropical cyclone gradually weakened, and recurved northeastward before dissipating over the Appalachian Mountains on August14.|$|E
5|$|Around 10:00pm {{local time}} on 4January, {{the centre of}} Tropical Cyclone Helen made {{landfall}} near Channel Point. As it moved ashore, the storm developed an eye; however, this feature began breaking apart once overland and the eyewall merged into the system's feeder bands. Roughly 12hours after landfall, Helen weakened to a tropical low before moving over the Gulf of Carpentaria late on 5January. Due {{to an increase in}} forward motion, the system was unable to regenerate sufficient convection to be reclassified a tropical cyclone <b>before</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> second landfall along the Cape York Peninsula. Once overland again, the remnants of Helen abruptly slowed and were last noted on 7January in the same region.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal began brightly {{in front}} of a crowd of 65,483, {{creating}} the first chance of the match in the 17th minute. Paul Davis set up striker Kevin Campbell, who hooked the ball high over goal. Four minutes later, Alan Smith headed the ball into the goal net, meeting a cross from Paul Merson; it was ruled out by referee Terry Holbrook for offside. Tottenham improved shortly after, with Gary Mabbutt heading the ball directly at Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman to create their first chance of the match. Their best opportunity to score was in the 36th minute. Vinny Samways set up Gary Lineker to break past the Arsenal defence. Having nudged the ball past Tony Adams, Lineker looked up, <b>before</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> cross for Nayim to head; the shot was acrobatically saved by Seaman's right foot.|$|E

5|$|At around 1100UTC on October1, Higos passed {{just east}} of the Miura Peninsula with winds of 130km/h (80mph), about 30minutes before making {{landfall}} in the eastern portion of Kanagawa Prefecture near Yokosuka. Higos passed very near Tokyo around 1200UTC that day, becoming the third strongest typhoon to affect the city since World War II, according to the JTWC. The typhoon weakened into a tropical storm while crossing Honshu. Higos briefly emerged over waters, <b>before</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> second landfall on Tomakomai, Hokkaidō at 2100UTC on October1. By that time, the storm was beginning to transition into an extratropical cyclone, and at 0600UTC on October2 Higos completed the transition. Simultaneously, the JTWC discontinued advisories. The storm continued to the north before crossing Sakhalin. The remnants dissipated on October4 just west of the Kamchatka Peninsula.|$|E
