25|$|Alan Davidson led {{their attack}} {{in this and}} other Tests. He had a {{beautiful}} action, run-up and delivery and, besides being pretty fast, he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late. Often, our batsmen {{had to make a}} hurried stroke against him because they thought it would not swing. Then when they got used {{to the fact that it}} did, he would send one down that didn't! <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that the great thing about Alan was to keep him from getting a wicket in his first four or five overs. If this happened, he was inclined to lose enthusiasm and with it went his fire. Unfortunately for us, this seldom happened.|$|E

[...] "I felt that we {{had an obligation to}} reach the vast majority of most of the people," [...] he said. [...] "We made an effort to continue purposeful drama on TV, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> out that people just don't want an anthology. They would rather tune in on Lucy." ...|$|E

Cambridge stroke John Pritchard said [...] "After our initial start we built up for 20 strokes, steadied {{and then just}} grinded away." [...] He added [...] "I was just stirring the tea while the others did the work." [...] Cambridge cox Carole Burton noted [...] "I went where I wanted to go." [...] Following tradition, Pritchard picked her up and threw her into the river. Oxford's Jones remarked [...] "we were as well prepared as last year <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> no magic." [...] Topolski conceded that even had Oxford been at their best, they would still have lost the race.|$|E

500|$|The pike {{and shot}} {{infantry}} had {{by this time}} adopted {{a system in which}} arquebusiers and pikemen were intermingled in combined units; both the French and the Imperial infantry contained men with firearms interspersed in the larger columns of pikemen. This combination of pikes and small arms made close-quarters fighting extremely bloody. The mixed infantry was normally placed in separate clusters, with the arquebusiers on the flanks of a central column of pikemen; at Ceresole, however, the French infantry had been arranged with the first rank of pikemen followed immediately by a rank of arquebusiers, who were ordered to hold their fire until the two columns met. Montluc, who claimed to have devised the scheme, wrote that: In this way we should kill all their captains in the front rank. [...] <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that they were as ingenious as ourselves, for behind their first line of pikes they had put pistoleers. Neither side fired till we were touching—and then there was a wholesale slaughter: every shot told: the whole front rank on each side went down. The Swiss, seeing the French engage one of the two columns of landsknechte, finally descended to meet the other, which had been slowly moving up the hillside. Both masses of infantry remained locked in a push of pike until the squadron of heavy cavalry under Boutières charged into the landsknechts' flank, shattering their formation and driving them down the slope. The Imperial heavy cavalry, which had been on the landsknechts' right, and which had been ordered by d'Avalos to attack the Swiss, recoiled from the pikes and fled to the rear, leaving Carlo Gonzaga to be taken prisoner.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{publication}} of his second novel, Sometimes a Great Notion in 1964, required his presence in New York, Kesey, Neal Cassady, and others in a group of friends they called the Merry Pranksters took a cross-country trip in a school bus nicknamed Further. This trip, described in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (and later in Kesey's unproduced screenplay, The Further Inquiry) was the group's attempt to create art out of everyday life, and to experience roadway America while high on LSD. In an interview after arriving in New York, Kesey is quoted as saying, [...] "The sense of communication in this country has damn near atrophied. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> as we went along it got easier to make contact with people. If people could just understand it is possible to be different without being a threat." [...] A huge amount of footage was filmed on 16mm cameras during the trip which remained largely unseen until the release of Alex Gibney's Magic Trip in 2011.|$|E
