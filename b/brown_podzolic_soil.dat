5000|$|Brown earths have a {{long history}} of being a major {{grouping}} in most soil classifications. In France they have been included with [...] "sol brun acide", although these soils may tend to have more iron and aluminium in the B horizon, and tend to what, in the British classification, is called a <b>brown</b> <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil.</b> Brown earths are also classified in the German and Austrian soil taxonomy as [...] "Braunerde." [...] Braunerden are widespread and frequently occur on unconsolidated parent sand or loess parent materials. [...] "Parabraunerde" [...] is the classification for a brown earth with an elluvial horison above a slightly argillic, clayey illuvial horizon. This gives rise to a universal division of these, generally brown and well drained soils into the weakly leached brown earths - called cambisols in the international World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB); and more leached brown podzolic soils in which there is an orange-brown B horizon, but no pale leached horizon between the A and the B horizons.

The basis {{for the study of the}} structural development and production potential of these forests are data from 12 sample plots, with the average size of 0. 18 ha. In terms of coenoecological affiliation all the sample plots belong to the group of ecological units - forests of spruce and fir (Abieti-Piceetum abietis, Mišić et Popović, 1978) on acid brown and brown podzolic soils, which are differentiated into 5 ecological units: Abieti-Piceetum abietis oxalidetosum on <b>brown</b> <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil,</b> Abieti-Piceetum abietis oxalidetosum on acid brown soil, Abieti-Piceetum abietis vaccinietosum on <b>brown</b> <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil,</b> Abieti-Piceetum abietis typicum on <b>brown</b> <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil</b> and Abieti-Piceetum abietis Dr. ymetosum on brown pozolic soil. In structural terms, these forests are characterized by very diverse structural forms, ranging from the structure of even-aged stands to typical multi-storey, unevenaged-aged stands. The form of cumulative curves of tree distribution is in most cases determined by spruce as the dominant species. At the same time, thin and medium-thick trees dominate, while the presence of stems with large dimensions is minimal. The average volume of these forestse is 777 m 3 •ha- 1, with a mixture ratio of 0. 7 : 0. 3 in favor of spruce. The average value of the current volume increment is 14 m 3 •ha- 1, with a 68 % share of spruce and 32 % of fir. The percentage of increment ranges from 1. 6 % to 2. 5 % in all sample plots and is somewhat higher for fir. The site potential, stand characteristics and relations among the tree species have resulted in structural complexity, high productivity and ecological stability of these forests. Therefore, future forest management should avoid radical measures and procedures that would violate the established relationships and dynamic processes.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to compare the impact of three systems of multiannual fertilization applied in two long-term field experiments on the content of phenolic compounds in the soil. In the study, both natural (manure, slurry) and mineral (NPK) fertilizers were used, along with combined, organic-and-mineral fertilization. Experiment I was established in 1972 on grey brown podzolic soil; experiment II, in 1973 on brown soil. In both experiments crops were cultivated in a 7 -year rotation, with a 75 % share of cereals. The experimental samples were taken from the top layer of soil after 36 (experiment I) and 35 (experiment II) years following the establishment of the experiments. It was demonstrated that the presence of phenolic compounds in the soils was significantly dependent on the contents of organic C and total N, type of soil and the type and dose of used fertilizers. In grey <b>brown</b> <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil,</b> the content of total phenolic compounds was at a lower level than the content found in brown soil. Multiannual fertilization contributed to an increase in the content of total phenolic compounds in relation to the values obtained in control objects, which was particularly reflected in the soil originating from objects fertilized with slurry applied at a dose being equivalent to manure in terms of the amount of introduced organic carbon.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Three soils of the Strathdon area, Aberdeenshire, {{derived from}} a biotite-rich quartz-gabbro and {{representing}} well-drained, imperfectly drained and poorly drained types, were studied. The 50 - 200 At fractions contained mainly plagioclase feldspar, amphibole (tremolite and hornblende), biotite and quartz and the following order of relative stability was established: quartz> amphibole> plagioclase feldspar> biotite. In all soils biotite was found to weather to a 14 A aluminous vermiculite-chlorite with zones of kaolinite. The clay mineral composition of three soils was identical, consisting of trioctahedral vermiculite-chlorite, trioctahedral iUite, kaolinite and gibbsite. These minerals originated in various ways through the decomposition of biotite which thus {{plays a key role}} in the origin of the clay fraction.

Cold sodium carbonate solutions extract as much interlayer A 1 as does oxalate, indicating that his fraction of the interlayer material is highly reactive, and sharply distinguished from more resistant interlayers which are also present. Polymeric hydroxyaluminium interlayers are a widespread feature of vermiculites and smectites in acid soils over a pH range of 4. 0 - 5. 8 (Barnhisel, 1977). A survey of the literature suggests that such interlayers are highly resistant to mild extraction procedures. Cold acid oxalate solutions are effective solvents for allophane and imogolite (Farmer et al., 1983), but are reported to have little effect on hydroxyaluminium interlayers (McKeague & Day, 1966; Iyengar et al., 1981; Aurousseau et al., 1983). Commonly, repeated treatments with hot citrate solutions or other more aggressive procedures are used to extract interlayer material (Barnhisel, 1977), but even these often effect only partial removal, as indicated by incomplete collapse of the interlayer spacing of K-saturated clays (e. g.

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE THESISHeathlands in The Netherlands are {{vanishing}} due to {{the invasion}} of trees. The transition from heathland to woodland in Dutch heathlands may either proceed directly or is preceded {{by the development of}} an intermediate grass heath. These changes are due to natural succession in the absence of management. In addition to the absence of management atmospheric pollution i. e. increased inputs of nitrogen has accelerated the replacement of heather heath by grass heath. The main hypothesis in this thesis is that the encroachment of grasses in heathlands as well as the response of the vegetation to management and environmental change depend on soil type, climatic conditions, and previous management. This thesis deals in particular with the performance of heather (Calluna vulgaris) and grasses (Molinia caerulea, Deschampsia flexuosa) on dry lowland heath as a function of environmental conditions in a site, with the purpose of matching management options with site conditions (Chapter 1). CHANGES IN DUTCH HEATHLANDSEvidence for replacement of heather by grasses in The Netherlands was obtained from sequential air photographs of heathlands. It is shown that apart from the transition of heathland to woodland, even before atmospheric pollution started in the seventies, heather was already being replaced by grasses in sites where there was no periodic management. However, in most sites the increase of grasses has been accelerated appreciably during the last decade (Chapter 2). RESTORATION OF HEATHThe results of long term field experiments (since 1976) show that a heathland taken over by grasses can be restored by turf cutting. Other treatments i. e. burning, ploughing or mowing treatments had no result, {{or in the case of}} mowing (including removal of the biomass), the result was short lived (Chapter 3). The good result of turf cutting may be due to physical environmental changes or changes in nutrients. It is shown that the establishment of heather after turf cutting has partly a physical explanation i. e. can be attributed to exposure of the bare soil, which enables heather seeds in the seed bank to germinate, while the shortlived grass seeds are absent (Chapter 4). These results also suggest that direct succession of heath to woodland (without a grassy stage) is {{due to the}} absence of grass seeds. SOIL TYPE AND LIFE SPAN OF HEATHERAlthough the establishment of heather after turf cutting has a physical explanation, the removal of nutrients by turf cutting does increase the life span of Calluna and reduces the competitive ability of the grasses. The effect of turf cutting lasts longer on poor soils. A heathland subjected to turf cutting appears to be more enduring on podzol soils than on more fertile <b>brown</b> <b>podzolic</b> <b>soils,</b> where the lifespan of heather plants is shorter. The advantage of a longer life span of heather is that the formation of suitable gaps for the establishment of grasses or other species is retarded (Chapter 5). Furthermore, in this chapter it is shown that the accelerated encroachment of grasses in heathland due to atmospheric pollution (Chapter 2) is likely to occur only in heathlands on <b>brown</b> <b>podzolic</b> <b>soils.</b> On such soils growth is limited by nitrogen, whereas on podzol soils, where growth is limited by phosphorus, nitrogen does not affect growth (Chapter 5). MANAGEMENT AND LIFE SPAN OF HEATHERThe nutrient status of a site depends not only on the soil present, but also on the management, and therefore growth rates and the life span of heather probably also depend on these. An analysis of the effects of burning on nutrient levels reveals that as much nitrogen may be depleted by fire as by turf cutting, particularly if the shorter rotation period of prescribed burning is taken into account (Chapter 6). Thus, it seems likely that the nitrogen-depleting effects of turf cutting and burning are more or less equal on <b>brown</b> <b>podzolic</b> <b>soils,</b> where nitrogen is the growth-limiting factor. Turf cutting, however, depletes phosphorus more effectively than burning and the phosphorus available to plants may even increase after a fire (Chapter 6). This implies that growth rates on podzol soils will be higher on burnt heath than on heath subjected to turf cutting. A comparison of growth of Calluna in Dutch heathlands confirms this (Chapter 7). CLIMATE AND LIFE SPAN OF HEATHERFinally, the effect of climatic conditions on the performance of heather is assessed. It is shown that the climate in The Netherlands - especially in the south of the countries sub- optimal for heather (Chapter 7). Periodic drought and frost frequently damage heather in Dutch heathlands and make it more susceptible to attack and damage from the heather beetle (Chapter 8). THE NEED FOR SITE SPECIFIC MANAGEMENTIt is hypothesized that heather plants in The Netherlands have a shorter life span because the climatic conditions are adverse for them. These adverse conditions can, however, be compensated to some extent by low nutrient levels, which induce higher carbohydrate levels in the heather plants. Plants with enhanced carbohydrate contents are less susceptible to plant damage and enable the plant to regrow after dying back. It is concluded that under climatic conditions that are sub-optimal for heather, as occur in The Netherlands (particularly in the South) heather can only for longer periods survive if nutrient levels are low. Turf cutting as practised in The Netherlands in the past was therefore not only an economic necessity, but seems also to be ecologically necessary if Dutch heathlands are to be kept purple (Chapter 8) ...|$|R

Microbial biomass and activity and nematode abundance showed pronounced summer maxima and winter minima. The long-term removal of sheep grazing from both grassland types resulted in significant reductions in microbial biomass and activity in the surface soil. The abundance of active soil fungi, measured as the fungal fatty acid 18 : 2 omega 6, was significantly reduced by the removal of sheep grazing, as was the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial fatty acids. Bacterial fatty acids were unaffected by the removal of sheep grazing. Possible mechanisms for these changes are discussed. Numbers of soil nematodes were significantly lower in the ungrazed sites. The effects of removing sheep grazing on nematodes and microbial community structure were most pronounced in brown earth soils. Factors responsible for these changes are discussed.

The ground vegetation had been hand weeded within a 3 m radius of each tree to remove competition for 32 P uptake.

These results are discussed in relation to the findings from other studies that the total phosphorus content of surface soils increases under developing birch stands.

The soil (1000 g) was watered every 8 days with 100 ml of examined chitosan solutions per pot. Control soil was watered with sterile distilled water. Seven days after each watering, soil samples were taken for microbiological analysis. Then 25 runner bean seeds were sown into each pot. After six weeks of plants' growth the experiment was finished and the number of plants was counted, their healthiness determined and soil microbiological analysis was performed. Regardless of chitosan form introduced to the soil it stimulated the growth of bacteria and fungi, since in these experimental combinations was found a significantly higher number of microorganisms as compared with the control. A particular high {{increase in the number of}} microorganism colonies was observed with simultaneous growth of plants and the application of chitosan. A considerable increase of fungi colonies from the Trichoderma genus was found in the soil treated with chitosan in the form ofboth a microcrystalline gel and a liquid. The species of this genus are considered to be antagonists; it affects pathogenic fungi through competition, antibiosis and over-parasitism. An increase in colonies of saprophytic microorganisms, including antagonistic ones of Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. was observed in the soil treated with chitosan. On the other hand, in the soil after the growth of bean and treated watered with chitosan only few colonies of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli- bean pathogen were found. The healthiness of plants grown in soil treated with chitosan was significantly better as compared to the control.

Organic carbon, Fe and Al were extracted with 0. 1 N NaOH/Na-tetraborate solution buffered at pH 9. 7 : recent studies have shown that this extraction is particularly appropriate for the detection of incipient podzolisation in <b>brown</b> earths-brown <b>podzolic</b> <b>soils</b> intergrades. Even if most of the classic podzolisation 'indexes' fail to illustrate differences, nevertheless our results show that fulvic acids and organo-ferric complexes are present in significantly greater amounts in {{the upper part of the}} cambic (B) 1 horizon of the soils developed under conifers. Moreover, this podzolic tendancy is confirmed by the weathering patterns of the clay minerals in the A 1 (B) horizons developed under spruces, i. e. a more pronouced weathering of chloritic layers than those observed in the beechwood soil, with a correlative genesis of more abundant smectite-like minerals. One may therefore conclude that the change in the humus type (moder to mor) after the planting of spruce trees, has been sufficient, within the local climatic and edaphic context, to promote incipient podzolisation. © 1981 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr. W.

EPN suspension was applied to the stumps of felled pine trees, and EPN efficacy was determined afterwards by directly assessing parasitism rates after debarking one quarter of the stumps and by collecting emerging adult weevils from traps erected over other treated and control stumps. Our results suggest that both species of EPN are equally effective in suppressing LPW populations to below the current, informal thresholds of economic damage. EPN were equally efficient in controlling LPW in peat and in mineral (lithosols/regosols and acid <b>brown</b> earth/brown <b>podzolics)</b> <b>soils.</b> Weevil density and distribution within pine stumps in peat versus mineral sites can explain patterns of LPW parasitism and suppression. Our results also suggest that infestation level (number of weevils per stump) can be an important factor in forecasting EPN application success as there is evidence of negative density-dependent parasitism when weevil densities were high. © 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelber...|$|R
40|$|In 2007 mature achenes of {{prickly lettuce}} (Lactuca serriola L.) were {{collected}} from a winter wheat crop growing on loess-derived brown earth soil, {{from the side of}} a dirt road, and from a hybrid alfalfa crop growing on heavy rendzina soil. In March 2008 the germination ability of achenes and the length of roots and above-ground parts of L. serriola seedlings were determined. The experiment was set up as a completely randomized design in 6 replicates and it was done in dishes. The dishes were filled with loess-derived <b>brown</b> <b>soil</b> and <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil</b> derived from light loamy sand with different pH values of 4. 5, 5. 5 and 7. 0 obtained using laboratory methods. The second experiment evaluated the effect of medium type and light conditions on the germination of Lactuca serriola achenes. The experimental design was the same as in the above described experiment. The study found that there were significantly more germinating seeds from the plants growing in the alfalfa crop and on the dirt roadside compared to the plants from the wheat crop. Emerging plants showed higher germination ability on loess-derived soil with a pH of 5. 5 and 7. 0 than on <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil</b> derived from sand with the same pH. Lactuca serriola prefers soils rich in calcium compounds, and developing segetal cenopopulations produce diaspores capable of germination, thereby the numbers of individuals can increase and the continuity of this species in crop fields can be maintained. Seeds germinated significantly better in the dark than under the conditions of 12 -hour illumination...|$|R
40|$|This project {{describes}} the Holocene environmental and pedogenic {{history of the}} Hiraethog Moors, particularly in relation to archaeological evidence. Ironpan stagnopodzol, brown podzolic and stagnohumic gley profiles have been studied from Aled Isaf together with cores from Cefn Mawr and Llyn y Foel-frech. Physical, chemical, clay mineralogical, micromorphological and palynological analyses have been undertaken and a time framework has been achieved by radiocarbon dating, including AMS 14 C dating of ironpan and charcoal samples. A search for tephra has been undertaken and, although none was located, {{the presence of a}} biolith bloom in a core from Llyn Cororion on the Arfon Platform raises the possibility of a geochemical reconstitution of a low volume, fine-grained tephra fall. Parent material was reworked by periglacial processes during the Late-glacial resulting in an oriented fabric, cracked stones and a redistribution of clay and fine siltsized material. Until 6 - 7, 000 years BP soils remained shallow and stony, with a clay mineralogy dominated by hydrous mica and chlorite. Between 6, 000 and 4, 000 years BP erosion led to deeper soil profiles on the lower slopes, burying flints and charcoal, and the woodland was periodically disturbed by humans. However, man was relatively inactive between 4, 500 and 3, 500 years BP. At 3, 500 years BP woodland cover declined rapidly due to human activity with a subsequent change to a Gramineae- and then a Calluna-dominated vegetation community. In low lying sites the result was increased waterlogging, gleying, structural collapse and the build up of organic matter at the surface i. e. stagnohumic gley. In better drained sites podzolisation occurred to produce the Bs horizon, i. e. <b>brown</b> <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil.</b> In profiles most intensively leached, mor humus and then peat accumulated. This induced surface waterlogging resulting in a mobilisation of iron, structural collapse and the formation of an Eag horizon, within which chlorite was destroyed and hydrous mica weathered to vermiculite, and an ironpan i. e. ironpan stagnopodzol. Through the integration of soil and pollen analysis, 14 C dating and archaeological information our understanding of soil development and human activity on Hiraethog has been increased...|$|E
40|$|The OAh and Ah horizons of acid <b>brown</b> and <b>podzolic</b> forest <b>soils</b> are {{reported}} to fix more radiocaesium than the mineral B horizons beneath them. We determined the respective influence of organic matter and clay minerals on the magnitude of Cs+ retention in a strongly acid brown forest soil in Belgium. The soil contained mica throughout the profile. Vermiculite was identified in the OAh and Ah horizons, and hydroxy interlayered vermiculite (HIV) in the Bw horizon. The OAh and Ah clay fraction retained much more Cs+ than the Bw horizon. The extraction of Al interlayers by Na-citrate resulted in a marked increase in Cs+ fixation in the Bw clays {{as well as the}} collapse of the vermiculitic layers after K+ saturation. Organic matter had a strong but indirect effect on Cs+ fixation. In the Bw horizon, acid weathering of layer silicates releases free Al and produces HIV minerals in which Al polymers block the access of radiocaesium onto Cs+-specific sites. In OAh and Ah horizons, free Al is complexed by organic acids. Consequently, the interlayer specific sites remain accessible for Cs+ fixation...|$|R
