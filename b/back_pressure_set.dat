40|$|AbstractObjective. To {{test the}} safety and {{efficiency}} of commercially available thrombectomy catheters in clearing simulated internal carotid artery (ICA) thrombosis. Design. Comparative in vitro study. Materials and methods. A model of the ICA was filled with human thrombus, the ‘circle of Willis’ <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> was <b>set</b> at either 10 or 30 cm of water. Five thrombectomy devices (Hydrolyser, Clot Buster, Acolysis System, AngioJet and Fogarty embolectomy catheter) were compared for (i) efficiency at removing thrombus, (ii) pressure changes {{at the tip of}} each device, and (iii) distal embolisation by flow cytometry. Results. Thrombus clearance was greatest with the AngioJet (median 95 %, range 92 – 97 %) and least with the Acolysis System (median 34 %, range 12 – 50 %). The Clot Buster and Hydrolyser were safest as they produced only negative tip pressures, the AngioJet and Balloon catheter produced positive and negative pressures risking distal embolisation. The Acolysis system produced no pressure change during use. Distal embolisation (of particles between 5 and 40 μm diameter) was greatest with the Fogarty balloon catheter at 10 cm water (P< 0. 05) and least with the Hydrolyser and Clot Buster. Conclusion.

The results show that high <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> has a significant adverse effect on the operation and reliability of the engine. The response to fluctuating <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> is strongly non-linear, and depends on the amplitude and period of the fluctuations.

The fundamentals of these processes haven been long studied by the diesel spray community from both experimental and numerical perspectives. However, certain topics such as the influence of nozzle geometry over the spray atomization, mixing and combustion process are still not completely well understood and predicted by numerical models. The present study seeks {{to contribute to the}} current understanding of this subject, by performing state-of-the-art optical diagnostics to liquid sprays injected through two singe-hole nozzles of different conicity. The experiments were carried out in a nitrogen-filled constant-pressure-flow facility. <b>Back</b> <b>pressures</b> were <b>set</b> to produce the desired engine-like density conditions in the chamber, at room temperature. The experimental setup consists in a diffused back illumination setup with a fast pulsed LED light source and a high-speed camera. The diagnostics focused on detecting the liquid spray contour and evaluating the influence of nozzle geometry over the time-resolved and quasi-steady response of the spray dispersion, at similar injection conditions. Results show a clear influence of nozzle geometry on spray contour fluctuations, where the cylindrical nozzle seems to produce larger dispersion in both time-resolved fluctuations and quasi-steady values, when compared to the conical nozzle. This evidences that the turbulence and radial velocity profiles originated at the cylindrical nozzle geometry are able to affect not only the microscopic scales inside the nozzle, but also macroscopic scales such as the steady spray. Observations from this study indicate that the effects of the flow characteristics within the nozzle are carried on to the first millimeters of the spray, in which the rest of the spray formation downstream is pre-defined...|$|R

40|$|Samples of {{electrolytic}} {{tough pitch}} (ETP) pure copper {{were subjected to}} 12 passes of Equal-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) at room temperature with and without <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> Subsequent annealing was performed to evaluate the influence of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> during ECAP on the thermal behavior of ultrafine-grained copper. The microstructural and hardness changes caused by annealing were characterized by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) and microhardness measurements. The application of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> resulted in an earlier drop in hardness upon annealing, which {{is believed to be}} associated with a lower critical temperature for the initiation of recrystallization and a rapid coarsening of microstructure. Regardless of whether <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> was applied or not, structure coarsening during short-time annealing of ECAP-processed copper was governed by discontinuous static recrystallization. This is seen as a result of microstructure heterogeneity. Analysis of recrystallization kinetics was carried out based on observations of the microstructure after annealing in terms of the Avrami equation. The magnitude of the apparent activation energies for recrystallization in the absence of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> {{and in the case of}} <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> of 100 MPa was estimated to be ~ 99 kJ/mol and ~ 91 kJ/mol, respectively.
