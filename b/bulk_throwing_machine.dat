40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} an advanced control system for tennis ball <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> {{to improve their}} accuracy according to the ball impact points. A further advantage {{of the system is}} the much easier calibration process involving the intelligent solution of the automatic adjustment of the stroking parameters according to the ball elasticity, the self-calibration, the use of the safety margin at very flat strokes and the possibility to placing the machine to any position of the half court. The system applies mathematical methods to determine the exact ball trajectories and special approximating processes to access all points on the aimed half court.

50|$|In 1700, the Italians {{were the}} most technologically {{advanced}} throwsters in Europe and had developed two machines capable of winding the silk onto bobbins while putting a twist in the thread. They called the <b>throwing</b> <b>machine,</b> a filatoio, and called the doubler, a torcitoio. There is an illustration of a circular hand-powered <b>throwing</b> <b>machine</b> drawn in 1487 with 32 spindles. The first evidence of an externally powered filatoio comes from the thirteenth century, and the earliest illustration from around 1500. Filatorios and torcitoios contained parallel circular frames that revolved round each other on a central axis. The speed of the relative rotation determined the twist. Silk would only cooperate in the process if the temperature and humidity were high.|$|R

500|$|Various <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> were in use {{throughout}} the classical and medieval periods. [...] Generally {{referred to as}} [...] "artillery", these engines could hurl, fire or shoot missiles and most could be used or adapted for throwing thermal weapons, by attacking and defending forces. [...] Barrels, fire pots and other breakable containers of pitch, Greek fire, and other incendiary mixtures could be thrown; other machines fired arrows and bolts, which could be ignited, or adapted to carry flammable mixtures. From the 12th century, Muslims in Syria were using clay and glass grenades for fire weapons, <b>thrown</b> by <b>machines.</b>|$|R

A family history narrates that in 1521, John Drummond was given the lands and mill of Milnab in Strathearn, and the royal charter {{described}} him in Latin as; [...] "Machinarum bellicarum ejaculator et carpentarius noster," [...] - [...] "keeper of the <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> of war and our carpenter." ...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a method to measure the {{performance}} of ancient <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> powered by torsional motors. This could be achieved using a model of torsional motor that allowed evaluating the torsional spring(s) elastic energy and by describing the machine kinematics; thus, the speed of the projectile was calculated from the moment the trigger was pulled to the instant in which the projectile left the machine. Since the ratio between the dimensions of the main parts of the ancient <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> was constant (they were designed on a modulus), once the size of one part of the machine (e. g. a remain) was known, the performance of the whole machine could be predicted. Finally, calculation examples are presented for a ballista designed according to Vitruvius' reports and for a repeating catapult; the results obtained showthat those “ancient artillery devices” thrust the projectile with considerable energy...|$|R

5000|$|Lombe's Mill was {{the first}} {{successful}} silk throwing mill in England. It was built on an island on the River Derwent in Derby. It was built after John Lombe visited Piedmont in 1717 and returned to England with details of the Italian silk <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> - the filatoio and the torcitoio - and some Italian craftsmen. The architect was George Sorocold. At its height, the mill employed some 300 people.|$|R

50|$|Modern {{automatic}} <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> {{can store}} hundreds of clay targets in a carousel and systematically self-load targets onto the throwing mechanism. Manual electric target throwers require {{a person in}} the traphouse with the trap machine, to set the target(s) by hand onto the machine arm. For both of these types, an electrical signal, from the push of a button or a sound activated device, causes the trap <b>machine</b> to <b>throw</b> its targets after the shooter calls for their bird(s).|$|R
50|$|A circle-throw {{vibrating}} machine is a screening machine employed in processes involving particle separation. In particle processes screening refers to separation of larger from smaller particles {{in a given}} feed, using only the materials' physical properties. Circle <b>throw</b> <b>machines</b> have simple structure with high screening efficiency and volume. However it has limitations on the types of feed that can be processed smoothly. Some characteristics of circle-throw machines, such as frequency, vibration amplitude and angle of incline deck also affect output.|$|R
50|$|Olympic Skeet is {{a variant}} of skeet shooting, and the {{specific}} variant used in the Olympic Games. Two <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> at different heights launch a series of 25 targets in a specific order, some as singles and some as doubles, with the shooter having a fixed position between them. Men's competitions consist of five such series, while women's have three. The top six competitors shoot an additional series as a final round, on targets filled with special powder to show hits more clearly to the audience.|$|R
5000|$|Lombe's Mill, in Derby was {{the first}} {{successful}} powered silk throwing mill in England. John Lombe visited a successful silk throwing mill in Piedmont in 1717, and returned to England with details of the Italian silk throwing machines- the filatoio, and the torcitoio, and with some Italian craftsmen built replicas. [...] This was an early example of industrial espionage. The architect George Sorocold built it next to Thomas Cotchett's failed 1704 mill (which used copies of Dutch <b>throwing</b> <b>machines)</b> {{on the west bank}} of the River Derwent. He and his half brother Thomas Lombe, born 1685, instructed George Sorocold to build a mill for the Italian-style machines. To the north of the powered Italian Works an un-powered Doubling Shop was built at some time before 1739, and when this mill was sold in 1739 to Thomas Wilson an inventory taken which still exists today. Thomas Lombe was given a 14-year patent to protect the design of the <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> he used. The King of Sardinia responded to this challenge badly, and stopped exporting suitable raw silk. It is speculated that he was responsible for John Lombe's mysterious death six years later in 1722. His elder brother, Thomas Lombe, took over the business.|$|R
50|$|The siegebegan upon Phocas' {{return from}} his raid. Phocas {{made sure to}} use the severed heads {{of many of his}} Muslim victims to attempt to demoralize the defenders. Phocas {{employed}} archers and <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> against the defenders while attempting to scale the wall using ladders. The fortress held, however, under the pressure of the bombardments, and the ladders were crushed. Phocas soon called off the siege. He now decided to blockade the city for the winter while his engineers began to design and construct more significant siege engines.|$|R

50|$|Due to his {{electrical}} engineering background, it soon become apparent that Yokoi was quite adept at developing electronic toys. These devices {{had a much}} higher novelty value than traditional toys, allowing Nintendo to charge a higher price margin for each product. Yokoi went on to develop many other toys, including the Ten Billion Barrel puzzle, a baseball <b>throwing</b> <b>machine</b> called the Ultra Machine, and a Love Tester. Another invention of his, in collaboration with Masayuki Uemura from Sharp, was the Nintendo Beam Gun Game, the precursor to the NES Zapper (which was used in games like Duck Hunt.).|$|R
500|$|Fire and {{incendiary}} {{weapons were}} used against enemy structures and territory, {{as well as}} personnel, sometimes on a massive scale. [...] Large tracts of land, towns and villages were frequently ignited {{as part of a}} scorched earth strategy. [...] Incendiary mixtures, such as the petroleum-based Greek fire, could be launched by <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> or administered through a siphon. [...] Sulfur- and oil-soaked materials were sometimes ignited and thrown at the enemy, or attached to spears, arrow and bolts and fired by hand or machine. [...] Some siege techniquessuch as mining and boringrelied on combustibles and fire to complete the collapse of walls and structures.|$|R

50|$|Thomas Lombe {{was given}} a 14-year patent to protect {{the design of the}} <b>throwing</b> <b>machines.</b> The King of Sardinia reacted badly to the {{commercial}} challenge, placing an embargo on the export of raw silk. It is speculated that he was responsible for John Lombe's mysterious death, six years later, in 1722. John's elder brother, Thomas, took over the business. When the patents lapsed in 1732, other mills were built in Stockport and Macclesfield. An unpowered doubling shop was built {{to the north of the}} powered Italian works some time before 1739. The mill was sold to Thomas Wilson in 1739. An inventory was taken of the doubling shop, which still exists.|$|R
5|$|Lit torches (burning sticks) {{were likely}} the {{earliest}} form of incendiary device. They {{were followed by}} incendiary arrows, which were used throughout the ancient and medieval periods. The simplest flaming arrows had oil- or resin-soaked tows tied just below the arrowhead and were effective against wooden structures. Both the Assyrians and the Judeans used fire arrows at the siege of Lachish in 701 BC. More sophisticated devices were developed by the Romans which had iron boxes and tubes which were filled with incendiary substances and attached to arrows or spears. These arrows needed to be shot from loose bows, since swift flight extinguished the flame; spears could be launched by hand or <b>throwing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
50|$|Head {{was also}} infamous for interfering in day-to-day {{operations}} of the company. In 1968 a management team {{was brought in to}} run the company, leaving Head as the chairman. Head preferred to be a hands-on manager, and after being pushed from the ski operations he lost interest and turned his attention to tennis. He started development of an aluminum tennis racquet, but in 1969 he sold the entire company to AMF for $16 million. Taking up tennis in earnest, his trainer quit in frustration and told Head to keep practicing with a ball <b>throwing</b> <b>machine.</b> The machine broke constantly, so Head tore it apart and re-designed it. Approaching the company with some improvements, instead he purchased Prince Sports outright. Continuing development of the aluminum racquet, Head invented the modern oversized design that revolutionized the industry.|$|R

50|$|There {{were seven}} mills built in Cheshire {{to throw silk}} before 1780. Two were in Congleton on the River Dane. Clayton and Pattinson's silk mill, the Old Mill, was built in 1773 and finally {{demolished}} in 2003. It was a 29 bay, five storey mill with an internal wheel-pit (for a waterwheel). It was described by Yates in 1822:The first silk mill {{which is the largest}} and most conspicuous structure in Congleton, is built of brick, with a pediment containing the dialplate of a clock in the centre. It is 240 feet long, 24 feet wide and 48 feet high, consisting of five storeys, and is lighted by 390 windowsEleven circular <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> were housed on the ground floor with winding machines above. In 1771 it employed 600. This was extended by another 17 bays in 1830.|$|R

500|$|Most of {{the terms}} used for <b>throwing</b> <b>machines</b> were vague, and could refer to {{different}} engines, all of which went through changes and developments over the period. Among the most common were the ballista, mangonel and trebuchet. The ballista was similar in form to a crossbow, though much larger, and used a string-winding mechanism to fire a missile or bolt placed in a groove. [...] Other giant crossbows were used throughout the period, and an [...] "espringal", based on the ballista, which threw large bolts, {{was developed in the}} 13th century. [...] Torsion-powered arrow firers had been used from 400 BC, and were adapted for stones. [...] A mangonel had a wooden spoon-shaped arm, to hold a stone or other projectile, which was manipulated under tension from a twisted rope. [...] The trebuchet was an advanced development of the 12th or 13th century, which used a counter-weight to power the throwing arm, and was the major siege engine until the cannon became widespread.|$|R
