5|$|Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a 1977 American {{science fiction}} film written and {{directed}} by Steven Spielberg, and starring Richard Dreyfuss, Melinda Dillon, Teri Garr, Bob Balaban, Cary Guffey, and François Truffaut. It tells the story of Roy Neary, an everyday <b>blue-collar</b> <b>worker</b> in Indiana, whose life changes after an encounter with an unidentified flying object (UFO).|$|E
5|$|Season {{one had a}} cast of {{four main}} actors. MacFarlane voiced Peter Griffin, a <b>blue-collar</b> <b>worker</b> and the patriarch of the Griffin family. The family's evil-genius baby Stewie and their anthropromorphic pet dog Brian, were also voiced by MacFarlane. Other {{members of the family}} include Peter's {{responsible}} but rebellious wife Lois Griffin, voiced by Alex Borstein; their self-loathing goody two-shoes teenage daughter Meg, voiced by Lacey Chabert; and their socially-awkward teenage son Chris, voiced by Seth Green.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to lesser-known videos such as A Night at the Revuebar (1983), the 1980s also featured mainstream films involving strippers {{and their work}} {{as part of the}} central narrative. These included Flashdance (1983), which told the story of <b>blue-collar</b> <b>worker</b> Alexandra (Alex) Owens (Jennifer Beals), who works as an exotic dancer in a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania bar at night and at a steel mill as a welder during the day. Blaze (1989) features Lolita Davidovitch as notorious stripper Blaze Starr. Starr herself appears in the film in a cameo role. Exotica (1994), directed by Atom Egoyan, is set in a Canadian lap-dance club, and portrays a man's (Bruce Greenwood) obsession with a schoolgirl stripper named Christina (Mia Kirshner). Showgirls (1995) was directed by Paul Verhoeven and starred Elizabeth Berkley and Gina Gershon. Striptease (1996), was an adaptation of the novel starring Demi Moore. The Players Club (1998) starred LisaRaye as a girl who becomes a stripper to earn enough money to enter college and study journalism.|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{technological}} change and the globalisation of the labour market, the share of <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> employed by Austria's manufacturing industry has fallen sharply in the period from 2000 to 2010. While the number of white-collar workers remained roughly unchanged, the number of <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> dropped significantly. The shift in demand for more highly skilled labour may have weakened the bargaining position of <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> in manufacturing. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Japanese {{white-collar workers}} are {{generally}} University educated, while <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> normally {{only have a}} high school diploma or have attended a trade or technical school. Before World War II, most <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> normally only had a normal elementary school (jinjō shōgakko (尋常小学校)) diploma or a senior elementary school (kōtō shōgakko (高等小学校)) diploma. Therefore, <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> were contemned as [...] "unscholarly" [...] and [...] "inferior" [...] in Japan.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{claims that}} {{employee}} involvement {{has led to}} significant sharing of traditional craft tasks with less skilled <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers,</b> activities such as routine maintenance, repair, and machine set-up (Table  8, rows 2 – 4), remain significantly more common among skilled <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{widespread}} strikes of 1980 {{were far}} from being the first clashes between the ruling party and the working class in Poland after World War II. Despite having a “socialist” government, the elite of the Polish ruling class averaged an income twenty times that of the <b>blue-collar</b> <b>worker.</b> This elite ruling class owned or largely controlled the police, media and industry of the state, including the state-organized unions. Insufficient pay and food shortages, in addition to a growing movement in favor of independent union activism led to strikes in 1956 and 1970 which left hundreds of workers dead from clashes with police, and both the 1970 and 1976 strikes ended with some concessions but subsequent additional repressions from management. Workers were increasingly dissatisfied with their standard of living and the half-hearted responses of the government to their calls for social justice, and when in July 1980 the government attempted to raise the price of meat even further, sit-in strikes started up again.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{comments}} on these speculations appeared early on. But as psychiatric historian Jan Armbruster (University of Greifswald) judged, {{they were not}} sufficiently convincing, {{such as in the}} case of journalist Ottmar Katz, author of a biography of Hitler's personal physician, Theodor Morell (1982). Katz suggested that Karl Kroner might have had personal reasons to report some untruths: living as a Jewish refugee in Reykjavik and forced to earn his life as a <b>blue-collar</b> <b>worker,</b> Kroner possibly hoped that the U.S. authorities would not only acknowledge him as a key witness but also help him to reestablish his medical practice. A comprehensive plausibility test was finally performed by the Berlin psychiatrist and psychotherapist Peter Theiss-Abendroth in 2008. In 2009, Armbruster carried this analysis forward, dismantled the hypotheses of Hitler’s hysteria diagnosis and hypnotherapy completely, and showed in detail how the story of Hitler’s alleged treatment by Forster became progressively elaborate and detailed between 1943 and 2006, not due to the evaluation of historical documents, but to continuous addition of narrative embellishments. Furthermore, Armbruster’s work offers the to date most comprehensive critique of the methodological weaknesses of many Hitler pathographies.|$|E

50|$|The postwar {{years in}} Japan {{witnessed}} a steady {{rise in the}} average Japanese standard of living, together with a narrowing of differentials between <b>blue-collar</b> and white-collar <b>workers.</b> The wage {{gap between the two}} groups was considerably reduced, bonuses were established and raised for <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers,</b> welfare facilities were made available to all employees, and the permanent employment guarantee was made available to regular <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Grey-collar workers {{often have}} licenses, {{associate}} degrees or diplomas from a trade or technical {{school in a}} particular field.

2500|$|Despite {{having an}} anti-collectivist and anti-statist party with an {{emphasis}} on personal rights and duties that was responsible for privatizing the industrial sectors nationalized during the revolutionary period, he increased social spending during his term, supported land reform and its redistribution in Alentejo and he was proud that his party had been adopted by the working, middle-class <b>blue-collar</b> <b>worker</b> and middle-low class workers and that his party defended [...] "the construction of a socialist society in liberty". Due to all these specificities, he called his party's ideology [...] "Portuguese Social Democracy".|$|E

[...] "This [...] {{is going to help}} me for a very long time", he later wrote, describing the genesis of a method he could use to come to more amicable terms with his own life. After graduating from Los Angeles High School, Bukowski attended Los Angeles City College for two years, taking courses in art, journalism, and literature, before quitting at the start of World War II. He then moved to New York to begin a career as a vagrant <b>blue-collar</b> <b>worker</b> with dreams of becoming a writer.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a bloody}} {{accident}} {{resulting in the}} death of a <b>blue-collar</b> <b>worker,</b> Édouard Mazé, in Brest in 1950, Abbé Pierre decided {{to put an end to}} his MRP affiliation on 28 April 1950, writing a letter titled [...] "Pourquoi je quitte le MRP" [...] ("Why I quit the MRP"), where he denounced the political and social attitude of the MRP party. He then joined the Christian socialist movement named Ligue de la jeune République, created in 1912 by Marc Sangnier, but decided to finally end his political career. In 1951, before the end of his mandate, he returned to his first vocation: to help homeless people. With the small indemnities he received as a deputy, he invested in a run-down house near Paris in the wealthy Neuilly-Plaisance neighbourhood. Astounding his neighbours, the priest began to repair the roof and the whole house, and finally made of it the first Emmaüs base (because, according to him, it was simply too big for one person).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of trade and migration on wages and labour market mobility. We estimate wage growth equations and a multinomial logit mobility equation on an individual data set for 1991 to 1994. We find substantial differences in the reactions of white and <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> wages and mobility to trade and migration. In Austria exports have a positive and imports {{a negative impact on}} wage growth only for <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers.</b> Migrants also reduce only <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> wage growth. Our results indicate that higher imports and an inflow of migrants reduce sectoral mobility of all types of workers. The risk of being out of work by contrast is increased by migration and imports for only <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers,</b> but reduced by exports for all types of workers. In general, our results suggest enlargement of the EU would have only small effects on the Austrian labour market. ...|$|R
40|$|Absenteeism affects organisations in many {{different}} ways, therefore {{it is essential to}} investigate absenteeism with the aim of minimising absence levels. The focus of the research was to investigate absenteeism amongst <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> at a Global Logistics Supplier. The objectives of this research were to identify the main types of absenteeism, to compare the views of <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> and management on the causes attributed to absenteeism, to describe how absenteeism has been measured and managed, and to make recommendations to the company on ways to minimize absenteeism based on the findings. Quantitative data in the form of monthly absenteeism statistics relating to each leave type, was examined for trends relating to absenteeism levels amongst <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> at the company. Semi-structured interviews were then carried out with management and <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> to examine the causes of absenteeism and its management. The results showed that there was a discrepancy between the views of management and <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> at the company on the perceived causes of absenteeism. On the other hand, both management and the <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> identified Monday and Friday as the most prevalent days on which employees are absent from the workplace. This finding suggests that more research should be conducted on this trend in <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers.</b> In exploring how absenteeism is dealt with, management within the company stated that discipline was the most effective way of keeping absenteeism levels low amongst employees. The limitations and delimitations of the research were recognised and further research ideas were given. It was also recommended that managers and supervisors address the workplace issues and identify when a worker’s performance and interpersonal relationships are strained in order to effectively minimise absenteeism. It is also recommended they implement a wellness programme...|$|R
40|$|Since 1989, <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> {{have been}} {{permitted}} to work in Taiwanese industries. Most <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> apply for jobs in Taiwan through blue-collar foreign workers’ agencies. Because <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> {{are not familiar with}} the language and culture in Taiwan, in occupational accident education and hazard prevention, the agencies {{play an important role in}} the coordination and translation between employees and <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers.</b> The purpose of this study is to establish the agencies’ role in the occupational accidents education and hazard prevention for <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> in Taiwan. This study uses a qualitative method—grounded theory—to collect, code, and analyze the data in order to understand the agencies’ role in occupational accident education and hazard prevention for <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> in Taiwan. The results show that the duty of agencies in occupational accident education and hazard prevention includes selecting appropriate <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers,</b> communicating between employees and <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers,</b> collecting occupational safety and health information, assisting in the training of occupational safety and health, and helping <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> adapt to their lives in Taiwan. Finally, this study suggests seven important points and discusses the implementation process necessary to improve governmental policies. The government and employees should pay attention to the education/training of occupational safety and health for <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> to eliminate unsafe behavior in order to protect the lives of <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the track allude to smoking {{cannabis}} as well as dating people from the working class, rather than urban men. In an interview with Zane Lowe at Beats 1, Gaga revealed that with [...] "John Wayne" [...] she explored her constant need to chase wild men and how she keeps getting [...] "bored of the same old John." [...] The song derives its title from John Wayne, an actor who starred in Western films. Sabienna Bowman of Bustle felt that although Wayne {{did not have any}} connection with Gaga, his films served as the [...] "perfect metaphor" [...] for the song's protagonist and her craving for wild men. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone compared [...] "John Wayne"'s lyrics with Paula Cole's [...] "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?" [...] (1996); in the latter Cole asks [...] "Where is my John Wayne?" [...] Andrew Unterberger from Billboard speculated that the lyrics, [...] "He called, I cried, we broke", could relate to Gaga's breakup with her fiancé Taylor Kinney. S.

In the third season episode [...] "Stuck Together, Torn Apart", Peter and Lois split up because of Peter's jealousy, only to discover that Lois has the same character flaw and the two decide to live with their mutually jealous nature. Peter has a very short attention span which frequently leads him to bizarre situations, as Chris points out in [...] "Long John Peter", after Peter's parrot dies [...] "He will get over it pretty quickly and then move on to another wacky thing", to which Peter finds a pipe organ and forgets about his parrot (Peter then destroys the pipe organ within seconds and then finds a deed to a cattle ranch). [...] Peter is also naïve with one example in [...] "Airport '07" [...] where he thinks his truck will fly by filling it with airplane fuel.|$|E

40|$|This {{exploratory}} research examines the wage {{effects of a}} variety of measures thought to be important in the employment income determination process. It does this by using ordinary least squares multiple regression techniques to construct wage equations for two samples of <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> in Montreal. <b>Blue-collar</b> wage equations are constructed for: (i) the Montreal labour market and (ii) the Montreal food processing industry. The results of this study show that Montreal blue-collar wages are determined by a variety of factors. Most importantly, however, are the wage effects exhibited by a worker's gender, union membership status and whether or not a worker has received a promotion from his/her present employer. These factors show statistically significant effects on the wages of <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> in the Montreal labour market {{as well as on the}} wages of <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> in the Montreal food processing industry. The present research also finds that certain factors have distinct wage effects on the different samples of <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> examined. Data from the present study indicates that the wages of Montreal <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> are influenced primarily by: (i) on-the-job training, (ii) promotions received, (iii) job opportunities available, (iv) an interruption in one's studies, (v) trade union membership and (vi) gender. While the wages of <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> employed specifically in the Montreal-area food processing industry are affected principally by: (i) the use of computers, (ii) the use of machines, (iii) promotions received, (iv) a varied work experience, (v) trade union membership, (vi) marital status and (vii) gender.
