2500|$|Hirsch {{proved that}} all of the {{dynamics}} of the attractor occur on a manifold of dimension N-1.

[...] An n-torus cannot exist in less than n dimensions, and finally, chaos cannot occur in less than three dimensions. [...] So, Hirsch proved that competitive Lotka–Volterra systems cannot exhibit a limit cycle for N < 3, or any torus or chaos for N < 4. [...] This is still in agreement with Smale that any dynamics can occur for N ≥ 5.|$|E

5|$|What you're <b>basically</b> <b>saying</b> is that Joe Berrios {{should get}} out of politics.

50|$|M.S. as {{a measure}} of {{structural}} capacity: This definition of margin of safety commonly seen in textbooks <b>basically</b> <b>says</b> that if the part is loaded to the maximum load it should ever see in service, how many more loads of the same force can it withstand before failing. In effect, this is a measure of excess capacity. If the margin is 0, the part will not take any additional load before it fails, if it is negative the part will fail before reaching its design load in service. If the margin is 1, it can withstand one additional load of equal force to the maximum load it was designed to support (i.e. twice the design load).|$|E
