Using stain-retaining assay (with <b>bromodeoxyuridine,</b> or BrdU), a low-cycling cell population was found in the papillary region, which was able to divide rapidly to repair the damaged caused by transcient renal ischemia. These cells are able to incorporate into other renal tissues, and was able to repeatedly form spheres in 3D cultures, and clonal analysis also exhibited its multipotency.|$|E

Hoechst 33342 exhibits a 10 fold greater cell-permeability than H 33258. Cells can integrate BrdU in newly synthesized DNA {{as a substitute for}} thymidine. When BrdU is integrated into DNA, it is supposed that the bromine deforms the minor groove so that Hoechst dyes cannot reach their optimal binding site. Binding of Hoechst dyes is even stronger to BrdU-substituted DNA; however, no fluorescence ensues. Hoechst dyes can be used with BrdU to monitor cell cycle progression.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, {{the use of}} HAT {{medium for}} cell culture {{is a form of}} {{artificial}} selection for cells containing working TK and HGPRT. Many useful refinements to the scheme are made possible by poisons that kill cells, but to which they are immune if they lack one of these genes. Thus, a cell lacking TK is resistant to <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> (BrdU) and a cell lacking HGPRT is resistant to 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 8-azaguanine. Thus, selection with one of the latter two drugs, followed by HAT medium, will yield revertant colonies.|$|E
5000|$|Strategies {{involving}} combing recently replicated DNA typically involve incorporating modified nucleotides (such as BrdU, <b>bromodeoxyuridine)</b> {{into the}} nascent DNA, then fluorescently detecting it. As replication forks spread bidirectionally from origins of replication at (approximately) equal speeds, then origin position can be inferred. Replacing the modified nucleotide pool {{with a different}} type of modified nucleotide after {{a certain amount of time}} allows development of a time-resolved picture of the firing of sites, and the kinetics of replication forks. Pause sites can be identified, merged replication forks resolved, and the frequency of origin firings in different time periods to be studied.|$|E
50|$|Weintraub {{attended}} Harvard College, obtaining his bachelor's {{degree in}} 1967. He {{then proceeded to}} the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned his M.D. and Ph.D. in 1972. Weintraub performed his Ph.D. dissertation research in the laboratory of Howard Holtzer, studying red blood cell development and production (erythropoeisis) in chicken embryos. This work included the study of cell cycle kinetics, hemoglobin synthesis, and the control of cell division. The effects of <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> on cell differentiation (conversion of a primitive cell into a more specialized cell) were also analyzed. While still only a graduate student, Weintraub's early work {{contributed significantly to the}} fields of developmental and cellular biology, yielding numerous peer-reviewed publications and setting the stage for the next chapter in his research explorations.|$|E
50|$|In the label-retention assay, {{the goal}} is to mark 'immortal' or parental DNA strands with a DNA label such as tritiated {{thymidine}} or <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> (BrdU). These types of DNA labels will incorporate into the newly synthesized DNA of dividing cells during S phase. A pulse of DNA label is given to adult stem cells under conditions where they have not yet delineated an immortal DNA strand. During these conditions, the adult stem cells are either dividing symmetrically (thus with each division a new 'immortal' strand is determined and in {{at least one of the}} stem cells the immortal DNA strand will be marked with DNA label), or the adult stem cells have not yet been determined (thus their precursors are dividing symmetrically, and once they differentiate into adult stem cells and choose an 'immortal' strand, the 'immortal strand' will already have been marked). Experimentally, adult stem cells are undergoing symmetric divisions during growth and after wound healing, and are not yet determined at neonatal stages. Once the immortal DNA strand is labelled and the adult stem cell has begun or resumed asymmetric divisions, the DNA label is chased out. In symmetric divisions (most mitotic cells), DNA is segregating randomly and the DNA label will be diluted out to levels below detection after five divisions. If, however, cells are using an immortal DNA strand mechanism, then all the labeled DNA will continue to co-segregate with the adult stem cell, and after five (or more) divisions will still be detected within the adult stem cell. These cells are sometimes called label-retaining cells (LRCs).|$|E
50|$|Cells of {{interest}} are cultured either in vivo or in vitro. During S-phase cells {{are treated with}} <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> (BrdU) which is then incorporated into their nascent DNA, acting {{as a substitute for}} thymidine. After at least one replication event has occurred, the daughter cells are synchronized at the G2 phase and individually separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The cells are directly sorted into lysis buffer and their DNA is extracted. Having been arrested at a specified number of generations (usually one), the inheritance patterns of sister chromatids can be assessed. The following methods concentrate on the DNA sequencing of a single daughter cell’s DNA. At this point the chromosomes are composed of nascent strands with BrdU in place of thymidine and the original template strands are primed for DNA sequencing library preparation. Since this protocol was published in 2012, the canonical methodology is only well described for Illumina sequencing platforms; the protocol could very easily be adapted for other sequencing platforms, depending on the application. Next, the DNA is incubated with a special dye such that when the BrdU-dye complex is excited by UV light, nascent strands are nicked by photolysis. This process inhibits polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the nascent strand, allowing only the parental template strands to be amplified. Library construction proceeds as normal for Illumina paired-end sequencing. Multiplexing PCR primers are then ligated to the PCR amplicons with hexamer barcodes identifying which cell each fragment they are derived from. Unlike single cell sequencing protocols, Strand-seq does not utilize multiple displacement amplification or MALBAC for DNA amplification. Rather, it is solely dependent on PCR.|$|E
50|$|A non-radioactive {{assay method}} has been {{developed}} by the company Dia-Sorin. In this technique 3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine (Zidovudine, AZT) is first phosphorylated to AZT 5'-monophosphate (AZTMP) by TK1 in the sample. AZTMP is measured in an immunoassay with anti-AZTMP antibodies and AZTMP-labeled peroxidase. The assay runs in a closed system on the laboratory robot from DiaSorin. The DiviTum assay from Biovica International uses another thymidine analogue, <b>bromodeoxyuridine,</b> as substrate to the enzyme. The product of the reaction is further phospholylated to tri-phosphate and incorporated in DNA-strings of polythymidine. The polythymidine binds to strings of polyadenine coupled {{to the bottom of}} the wells in microtiter plates. There it is detected with ELISA technique: The wells are filled with a solution of a monoclonal antibody to bromo-deoxyuridine. The monoclonal antibody has been bound (conjugated) to the enzyme alkaline phosphatase. After the unbound antibody with attached alkaline phosphatase has been washed away, a solution of a substrate to the alkaline phosphatase, para-nitrophenylphosphate, is added. The product of the reaction, para-nitrophenol, is yellow at alkaline pH and can be measured by photometry. This method has been evaluated against the previous radioactive technique. It gives a considerably more sensitive determination than the previous methods and is therefore suitable for use with solid tumors that give less elevation of the thymidine kinase in body fluids. Comparisons of the methods have been published. A variation of the technique is using homogeneous ELISA for the measurement. Direct determination of the thymidine kinase protein by immunoassay has also been used. This method does not correlate well with the methods measuring the enzymatic activity. One explanation is that the method also measures protein that is enzymatically inactive and that the degree of inactivation varies for different sources of thymidine kinase in the body.|$|E
40|$|The growth {{characteristics}} of a bromodeoxyuridine-dependent cell line that was derived from a non-contact-inhibited Syrian hamster melanoma line were studied. The dependent cells require high concentrations of <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> not only for optimal growth {{but also for the}} maintenance of the non-contact-inhibited state. When grown in the absence of <b>bromodeoxyuridine,</b> the dependent cells become contact-inhibited. The transition to the contact-inhibited state is reversed when <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> is added back to the medium, if the <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> is incorporated into dividing cells.

Labeling with [3 H]thymidine and <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> of rat vascular SMC in culture stained 11 % +/- 2 % and 11 % +/- 1 % of cells, and PCNA immunohistochemistry 22 % +/- 2 % of cells. Proliferation {{in the media}} of the denuded rat aortae was highest 3 days after denudation: 4. 2 %, 3. 8 %, and 4. 7 % of labeled cells with [3 H]thymidine, <b>bromodeoxyuridine,</b> and PCNA, respectively. In the intima, proliferation was highest 7 days after denudation with 42 % [3 H]thymidine, 40 % <b>bromodeoxyuridine,</b> and 46 % PCNA-positive cells. With double labeling, all [3 H]thymidine-positive cells were PCNA positive, whereas some cells were only positive for PCNA.

40|$|The {{replacement}} of thymidine by 5 -bromodeoxyuridine in DNA {{leads to a}} greatly enhanced stability of chromatin from hepatoma tissue culture or embryonic rat pancreas, as measured by thermal chromatography on hydroxylapatite. The increased stability is directly correlated with the degree of <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> substitution. On the other hand, the incorporation of <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> into DNA results in a modest stabilization of purified DNA. Substitution of nucleotide also alters slightly the hyperchromicity profile generated during the thermal denaturation of purified DNA and chromatin. The observed changes can best be explained by an altered interaction between the bromodeoxyuridine-DNA and other chromatin components, presumably proteins. These results suggests that the selective effects of <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> on cytodifferentiation {{may be due to}} an increased affinity of regulatory proteins for bromodeoxyuridine-DNA...|$|E

A line of cells, called HAB, was isolated. The HAB cells have been maintained in continuous cultivation for over nine months and have undergone more than 125 population doublings. Direct base analysis showed {{that the level of}} substitution of <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> for thymidine in nuclear DNA was at least 99. 8 %, and possibly 100 %. The existence of such cells raises many questions. The expected high frequency of bromodeoxyuridine-induced base transitions, including errors in both replication and transcription, would seem to be incompatible with the apparently stable transmission and expression of the genetic information in these cells...|$|E

40|$|In vitro uptake of <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> and {{expression}} of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were evaluated histochemically in rectal mucosa of control subjects and subjects with colorectal neoplasia in large intestine adenomas and adenocarcinomas. Both labeling indices progressively increased {{along the path}} of tumor progression, as did the difference between them (PCNA labeling indices were always greater than those of <b>bromodeoxyuridine).</b> The correlation between them was fairly close in the controls and in adenomas with low-grade dysplasia, whereas no significant linear relations were noted in adenomas with high-grade dysplasia or in adenocarcinomas. The progressive increase in PCNA would thus seem {{to be related to}} both hyperproliferation and neoplastic deregulation of PCNA synthesis. In the mucosa of subjects with colorectal neoplasia, PCNA labeling revealed hyperproliferation but not the surface-wards shift of the proliferative compartment detected by <b>bromodeoxyuridine.</b> PCNA expression, therefore, is not a sufficiently sensitive marker of the risk of tumor transformation in the intestinal mucosa...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the hypothesis that}} endogenous neural progenitor cells isolated from the neocortex of ischemic brain can differentiate into neurons or glial cells and contribute to neural regeneration. We performed middle cerebral artery occlusion to establish a model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in adult rats. Immunohistochemical staining of the cortex 1, 3, 7, 14 or 28 days after injury revealed that neural progenitor cells double-positive for nestin and sox- 2 appeared in the injured cortex 1 and 3 days post-injury, and were also positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein. New neurons were labeled using <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> and different stages of maturity were identified using doublecortin, microtubule-associated protein 2 and neuronal nuclei antigen immunohistochemistry. Immature new neurons coexpressing doublecortin and <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> were observed in the cortex at 3 and 7 days post-injury, and semi-mature and mature new neurons double-positive for microtubule-associated protein 2 and <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> were found at 14 days post-injury. A few mature new neurons coexpressing neuronal nuclei antigen and <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> were observed in the injured cortex 28 days post-injury. Glial fibrillary acidic protein/bromodeoxyuridine double-positive astrocytes were {{also found in the}} injured cortex.

40|$|The {{sequence}} selectivity of 300 nm {{ultraviolet light}} damage to DNA containing <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> or iododeoxyuridine was examined on DNA sequencing gels. This was accomplished using {{a system where}} an M 13 template was employed to direct synthesis of DNA in which thymidine was fully substituted with <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> or iododeoxyuridine. The sites of damage corresponded to the positions of analogue incorporation. The extent of damage varied considerably at different sites of cleavage and ranged from the undetectable to over fifteen times the limit of detection (as assessed by laser densitometer scans). Strong damage sites had the "consensus" sequence CTT while sites of no detectable damage had the "consensus" sequence GTR. <b>Bromodeoxyuridine</b> and iododeoxyuridine had the same sites of damage although the extent of damage varied at different sites and <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> damage was slightly greater than iododeoxyuridine. DNA containing thymidine was not damaged to any detectable level in this system with 300 nm ultraviolet light. The use of three closely related DNA sequences as targets for damage confirmed that (1) the sites of analogue incorporation are the cause of ultraviolet damage; and (2) that the neighbouring DNA sequence is an important parameter in determining the extent of damage. It is proposed that the microstructure of DNA [...] in particular {{the distance between the}} 5 -carbon of the pyrimidine base (which is attached to the halogen) and hydrogen on the 2 ' carbon of the 5 '-deoxyribose [...] ultimately determines the degree of cleavage with large distances giving a small degree of damage and smaller distances a large degree of damage...|$|E

Sister chromatid exchanges were counted on 50 s cycle metaphase spreads, randomly scored, for each donor at each dose. The mean rate of sister chromatid exchanges/cell at 0. 1 !Lg/ml of BUdR was 2. 48 f 1. 75, which can be considered as spontaneous.

40|$|Samples (110) {{of human}} mandibular gingiva and buccal mucosa, {{harvested}} from patients undergoing third-molar surgery, {{were subjected to}} in vitro labelling with tritiated thymidine, <b>bromodeoxyuridine,</b> or a sequential double-labelling technique comprising tritiated thymidine followed by <b>bromodeoxyuridine,</b> {{in order to determine}} the efficacy of a new incubation labelling technique, and to characterize S-phase labelling indices in human oral mucosa. Whilst, there were no demonstrable differences in labelling indices obtained by single thymidine, single <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> or double labelling, there was a significant difference between anatomical sites, with higher S phase labelling observed in buccal mucosa (mean LI 11. 7) than mandibular gingiva (mean LI 8. 5; P < 0. 01). There was, however, no significant correlation between individual labelling indices and patient age, sex or the time of day when tissue was harvested. The in vitro labelling technique provides a reliable and quantifiable method of characterizing proliferative labelling indices in the human oral cavity. Further investigation is being carried out to profile wider age and anatomical ranges and to utilize the double-labelling technique to calculate S-phase durations and cell-cycle times.

40|$|When DNA is {{extracted}} from Chinese hamster cells {{grown in the}} presence of 5 -bromodeoxyuridine {{from the beginning of the}} S (synthesis) phase until the middle of the first replication round, a significant fraction of total replicated DNA bands at intermediate densities between light-light and light-heavy DNA, in a CsCl gradient. Incomplete <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> substitution compared with light-heavy DNA justifies the displaced banding of these molecules. Since "intermediate DNA" following alkaline or thermal denaturation gives rise to unsubstituted and fully substituted single strands, its particular density in neutral gradients cannot be ascribed to a uniformly reduced degree of <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> substitution nor to covalently joined light and heavy strands. The segregation of DNA of intermediate densities into light-light and light-heavy components after shearing suggests that it includes at least one junction between replicated and still unreplicated segments, i. e. one replication fork that may or may not have lost one of its prongs. DNA of intermediate density specifically contains one to two sites sensitive to breakage by Neurospora crassa endonuclease. When a two-minute pulse of tritiated <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> is given during replication in unlabelled heavy medium, the DNA fragments (mol. wt 35 × 106) containing labelled segments band essentially at intermediate positions and are progressively converted to light-heavy molecules, with increasing duration of chase. The half-life of this pulse-labelled intermediate DNA (about 25 min) is consistent with the proportion of total replicated DNA found at displaced densities (10 to 15 %) and, together with the distribution of the intermediate radioactivity, is compatible with the existence of adjacent growing replicons. If DNA is labelled and extracted during the second replication round {{in the presence of}} <b>bromodeoxyuridine,</b> "intermediate DNA" with similar properties is found between the light-heavy and heavy-heavy peaks. © 1974.

40|$|Estrogen is {{reported}} to prevent age-associated epidermal thinning in the skin. We examined if 17 β-estradiol (E 2) may enhance the growth of human keratinocytes, focusing on its effects on the expression of cell cycle-regulatory proteins. E 2 enhanced proliferation, <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> incorporation of keratinocytes, and increased the proportion of cells in the S phase. The E 2 -induced stimulation of proliferation and <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> incorporation was suppressed by antisense oligonucleotide against cyclin D 2, which induces G 1 to S phase progression. E 2 increased protein and mRNA levels of cyclin D 2, and resultantly enhanced assembly and kinase activities of cyclin D 2 -cyclin-dependent kinases 4 or 6 complexes. E 2 enhanced cyclin D 2 promoter activity, and the element homologous to cAMP response element (CRE) on the promoter {{was responsible for the}} effect. Cyclin D 2 expression was enhanced by antiestrogens, ICI 182, 780 and 4 -hydroxytamoxifen, and membrane-impermeable bovine serum albumin-conjugated E 2, indicating the effects via membrane E 2 -binding sites. E 2 increased the enhancer activity of CRE-like element and the amount of phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding this element, and the increases were suppressed by H- 89, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. H- 89 also suppressed E 2 -induced cyclin D 2 expression, proliferation, and <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> incorporation in keratinocytes. Antisense oligonucleotide against G-protein-coupled receptor GPR 30 suppressed the E 2 -induced increases of phosphorylated CREB, cyclin D 2 level, proliferation, and <b>bromodeoxyuridine</b> incorporation in keratinocytes.
