40|$|In this paper, a {{study of}} the {{coupling}} between a rectangular waveguide and circular waveguide is presented, aimed at developing a design procedure for a rectangular to circular waveguide directional coupler. Since radio-astronomical receivers often exploit circular horns, a coupler sharing the same waveguide type is at a premium, and furthermore, it reduces the feeding network complexity in dual polarization applications. A novel approach for obtaining traveling wave modal amplitude coefficients is presented, suitable for modes of any order. This approach is used to analyze the behavior of a single <b>hole</b> <b>coupler</b> between a rectangular and circular waveguide. From this starting point, a four <b>holes</b> directional <b>coupler</b> with good performance is designed in the 22 -GHz band...|$|R

Waveguide to cavity coupling for arbitrarily oriented rectangular iris is analyzed using <b>Bethe’s</b> small <b>hole</b> coupling theory.

40|$|The use of capacitive-mesh output {{couplers}} for optically pumped far-infrared molecular lasers {{has been}} extended throughout the far-infrared spectrum, between 42 gm and 1. 2 mm, and the optimum grid constants have been found for several lines. At shorter wavelengths, performance has been improved {{by the use of}} a novel hybrid capacitive-mesh <b>hole</b> output <b>coupler.</b> The performance of optically pumped far-infrared (FIR) molecular lasers has recently been substantially improved by the use of overmoded dielectric waveguide cavities. 1 - 3 In order {{to take full advantage of}} the favorable characteristics of these lasers, it is important to use a well designed output coupling mirror, a component that has received much attention recently. This mirror should have high reflectivity at the pump wavelength, Xp, and partial reflectivity and low absorptivity at the FIR wavelength, XFIR, and should couple out over a broad area of the laser mode to limi...|$|R

40|$|We {{design an}} {{efficient}} coupler to transmit {{light from a}} strip waveguide into the flatband slow mode of a photonic crystal waveguide with ring-shaped <b>holes.</b> The <b>coupler</b> is a section of a photonic crystal waveguide with a higher group velocity, obtained by different ring dimensions. We demonstrate coupling efficiency in excess of 95 % over the 8 nm wavelength range where the photonic crystal waveguide exhibits a quasi-constant group velocity v(g) approximate to c/ 37 and observe a more than 12 -fold intensity enhancement in the slow-light waveguide. An analysis based on the small Fabry-Perot resonances in the simulated transmission spectra is used for studying {{the effect of the}} coupler length and for evaluating the coupling efficiency {{in different parts of the}} coupler. The mode conversion efficiency within the coupler is more than 99. 7 % over the wavelength range of interest. The parasitic reflectance in the coupler, which depends on the propagation constant mismatch between the slow mode and the coupler mode, is lower than 0. 6 %. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a compact {{polarization}} beam splitter {{based on a}} deformed photonic crystal directional coupler is designed and simulated. The transverse-electric (TE) guided mode and transverse-magnetic (TM) guided mode are split due to different guiding mechanisms. The effect of the shape deformation of the air <b>holes</b> on the <b>coupler</b> is studied. It discovered that the coupling strength of the coupled waveguides is strongly enhanced by introducing elliptical airholes, which reduce the device length to less than 18. 5 mu m.

40|$|We present {{measurements}} of the temporal and spectral properties of radiation produced from the step-tapered undulator infrared free-electron lasers (FELs), CLIO in France and FELIX in the Netherlands. Using a two section undulator with independently adjustable deflection parameters, K, the FEL will operate either with an enhanced efficiency and improved spectral properties (with a small positive Delta K step) or simultaneously at two frequencies (for large Delta K). Using a dispersion-free <b>hole</b> output <b>coupler</b> the maximum wavelength difference delta lambda/lambda, has now been extended to more than delta lambda/lambda approximate to 0. 6. We also present measurements that show that the FEL FELIX will produce significant power simultaneously at two wavelengths by coherent spontaneous emission when the wavelength is long and the electron bunch is short. The efficiency, spectral and temporal properties have been measured. We show that at the maximum efficiency, Delta K approximate to 0. 02, the optical pulses generated are smooth and close to Fourier transform limited. By adjusting Delta K the optical pulse duration can be varied {{by a factor of}} 2 or more and sidebands due to synchrotron oscillations can be suppressed...|$|R
40|$|The {{waveguide}} to cavity {{coupling coefficient}} β for {{two types of}} accelerating structures: a Plane Wave Transformer (PWT) linac and a 1. 6 cell photocathode gun have been tuned to obtain critical coupling in both. Analytical calculations of {{the dimensions of the}} slot required for critical coupling have been done using Gao’s formulation based on the <b>Bethe’s</b> theory for <b>hole</b> coupling. While the PWT linac structure, with high inter-cell coupling, shows good agreement between measured and predicted slot dimensions for different values of β, the agreement is not so good in the photocathode gun on account of poor inter-cell coupling and a new tuning method has been devised to tune the gun. This paper discusses details of the analytical calculation of slot dimensions for the two structures, their comparison with experimentally measured results, and the procedure adopted for tuning the two structures to critical coupling...|$|R
40|$|We {{summarize}} {{recent work}} {{showing that the}} 1 /r^ 2 model of interacting particles in 1 -dimension is a universal Hamiltonian for quantum chaotic systems. The problem is analyzed in terms of random matrices and {{of the evolution of}} their eigenvalues under changes of parameters. The robustness of bulk space-time correlations of a many particle system to changing boundary conditions is suggested to be {{at the root of the}} universality. The explicit density-density correlation functions of the 1 /r^ 2 model, now available through the above mapping at two values of the coupling constant, are interpreted in the light of Bethe's Ansatz, giving a vivid picture of the fractionalization of bare particles or holes into "quark" like <b>Bethe</b> quasi-particles and <b>holes.</b> Comment: bss@physics. att. com from March, Physics Department, Indian Institute of Science, BANGALORE, 560012 India bss@physics. iisc. ernet. in, To appear in the proceedings of the 16 th Taniguchi International Symposium on the Theory of Condensed Matter: "Correlation Effects in Low Dimensional Electron Systems'...|$|R
40|$|Fused coupler forming with a {{single-mode}} fiber (SMF) and a photonic crystal fiber (PCF) {{is one of}} the solutions for optical coupling from a light source to a PCF. In this paper, we presented coupling characteristics of a fused fiber coupler formed with an ordinary SMF and a PCF having air hole collapsed taper. A prototype of SMF-PCF <b>coupler</b> with air <b>hole</b> collapsed taper was fabricated using CO 2 laser irradiation. The coupling efficiency from SMF to PCF was − 6. 2 [*]dB at 1554 [*]nm wavelength in the fabricated coupler. The structure of the SMF-PCF coupler to obtain high coupling efficiency was theoretically clarified by beam propagation analysis using an equivalent model of the coupler with simplification. It was clarified that appropriately choosing the prestretched or etched SMF diameter and the length of air hole collapsed region was effective to obtain high coupling efficiency that was a result of high extinction ratio at cross port and low excess loss. We also demonstrated that the diameter of prestretched SMF to obtain high coupling efficiency was insensitive to the air hole diameter ratio to pitch of the PCF in the air <b>hole</b> collapsed SMF-PCF <b>coupler...</b>|$|R
