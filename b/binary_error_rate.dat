40|$|Abstract: TCP Algorithms were {{developed}} to avoid congestion in wired networks and to increase the throughput. The efficiency of TCP in the wired networks has been demonstrated because it was designed for it. Because of its well-known performance, it {{was used for the}} wireless network, but these algorithms loose their performance when the <b>Binary</b> <b>Error</b> <b>Rate</b> (BER) increases, such as in wireless LANs. In wireless networks, the implicit assumption which TCP makes that losses indicate network congestion is no longer valid. Losses in wireless networks can result from bit errors, fading and handoffs. In this paper we will compare the result of using classic TCP algorithms in wireless, we will demonstrate the relationship between the throughput and the BER and we will improve the throughput offered by changing the length of the initial congestion window...|$|E

These systems should be efficient in terms of bandwidth and power allocation and will satisfy the users requirement on low power consumption, little interferences with other systems, and high rate transmission. Moreover, low complexity transceivers are expected. This paper will propose a novel multiple access technique called OWDM-IDMA (Orthogonal Wavelength-Division Multiplexing-Interleave Division Multiple Access) as the combination of the OWDM (Orthogonal Wavelength-Division Multiplexing) and IDMA (Interleave Division Multiple Access) schemes. The IDMA and OWDM principles are also outlined.

40|$|International audienceMANET are {{characterized}} by their limited bandwidth and high packet error rate. In mobility, multi-path and shared bandwidth contexts, routing protocols play a major role. On-demand routing approaches lead to high delay while, in linkstate protocols, controls messages broadcasting consumes much bandwidth. Hybrid protocols such as Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) attempt to exploit the advantages of both approaches. It uses limited scope proactive approach to maintain routes towards a surrounding zone and reactive approach to communicate with farther destinations. For a better exploitation of network capabilities, we propose a <b>Binary</b> <b>Error</b> <b>Rate</b> (BER) based approach of ZRP (BER-ZRP). With BER-ZRP, all phases of linkstate recording and routing tables calculation are under Quality of Service control so that better paths in terms of BER are preferred.

40|$|Abstract — Consider {{observations}} where random {{signals are}} randomly present or absent in independent and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). By using a recently estab-lished limit theorem, we {{introduce a new}} estimator for the estimation of the noise standard deviation when the signals are less present than absent and have unknown probability distributions. The bias, the consistency and the minimum attainable {{mean square estimation error}} of the estimator we propose are still unknown. However, the experimental results that are presented are very promising. First, when the Minimum-Probability-of-Error decision scheme for the non-coherent detection of modulated sinusoidal carriers in independent AWGN is tuned with the outcome of our estimator instead of the true value of the noise standard deviation, the <b>Binary</b> <b>Error</b> <b>Rate</b> tends to the optimal error probability when the number of observations is large enough. Second, given some speech signal corrupted by independent AWGN, our estimator can be used to estimate the noise standard deviation so as to adjust the standard Wiener filtering of the noisy speech. The objective performance measurements obtained by so proceeding are very close to those achieved when the Wiener filtering is tuned with the true value of the noise standard deviation.

40|$|Abstract — A {{serially}} {{concatenated coding}} system which can operate without channel state information (CSI) {{with use of}} a simple channel estimation technique is presented. This channel estimation technique utilizes the inner decoder’s a posteriori probability (APP) information about the transmitted symbols to form a channel estimate for each symbol interval, and is termed APP channel estimation. The serially concatenated code (SCC) is comprised of an outer rate 2 / 3 <b>binary</b> <b>error</b> control code, separated by a bit interleaver from an inner code consisting of an 8 -PSK bit mapping and differential 8 -PSK modulation. Coherent decoding provides bit <b>error</b> <b>rate</b> (BER) performance 0. 6 dB from 8 -PSK capacity for large interleaver sizes. APP channel estimation decoding without initial CSI over constant and random walk phase models shows near-coherent results, with fractions of a dB performance loss for random walk and linear phase models...|$|R

Such a performance analysis has been previously undertaken in the literature, but is limited to binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and 4 -quadrature amplitude modulation (4 -QAM) constellations. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} then to analyze the BER floor achieved by a 16 -QAM OFDM signal in a Rayleigh channel. To achieve this, the <b>binary</b> <b>error</b> probability is obtained by carrying out the analysis on maximum significant bits (MSB) and least significant bits (LSB). The MSB leads to the similar results as those obtained in 4 -QAM, but very specific developments are required to obtain the error probability of the LSB.

40|$|In digital communications, {{conventional}} linear {{and decision}} feedback equalizers are optimal for stationary signals [1]. However, modulated signals are polycyclostationary (PCS) : their correlation fi. mctions are time-polyperiodic [2]. Cyclic equalization structures optimized by the MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error) criterion are {{proposed in the}} paper. The proposed structure {{is based on a}} multidimensional input. The latter is built from the received signal possibly shified by its cyclic frequencies. We show by simulation that the proposed cyclic structures give better performance in terms of <b>binary</b> <b>error</b> <b>rate</b> than the conventional equalizers. The paper is organized as follows. First, we review some background topics on cyclostationarity and optimum jilte-ring of PCS signals. Then we calculate the expressions of the forward and backward filters for the cyclic DFE and deduce the expression of the linear cyclic equalizer. Finally, simulation results of conventional and cyclic equa-lizers are given for BPSK and MSK signals jammed by other modulated signals. The new cyclic structures are particular suitable for FDi 14 A networks disturbed by adjacent channel interferences (ACI). They can lead to a significant improvement in the number of communication channels within a given bandwidth. Besides, cyclic structures can also be used for transmission links disturbed by jammers that are modulated signals with the same or different baud rates. I...|$|E
40|$|Proceeding of: 12 th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing, Cartagena, Spain, July 4 - 6, 2011 Optical Code Division Multiple Access (OCDMA) {{techniques}} have shown outstanding capabilities in {{the sharing of}} optical media, in particular in access networks. However, OCDMA systems may suffer from Multiple Access Interference (MAI) {{and other kinds of}} noise when many users access the shared media simultaneously, increasing the BER (<b>Binary</b> <b>Error</b> <b>Rate)</b> to unacceptable levels, that is, a situation at which all combined signals interfere and are lost. This work proposes a mixed OCDMA and Tunable Transmitter- Fixed Receiver (TT-FR) WDM and ring architecture at which the ring is split into small-size segments to limit the probability of MAI. Essentially, every segment in the ring has got two hub nodes (on the segment’s head and tail) which forwards inter-segment traffic to other hub nodes on dedicated home wavelengths, thus making use of WDM. The access media inside the segment is shared between the nodes by means of OCDMA, and code reuse is possible on different segments. Our performance analysis shows how to split a given ring into segments in order to minimise the BER due to multiple users accessing the network and allow for high bit-rates for a given traffic load. In addition, we analyse the possibility of introducing Forward Error Correction (FEC) at a moderate overhead cost to improve performance.
