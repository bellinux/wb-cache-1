40|$|Tree {{mortality}} {{is the least}} understood process of a tree’s life-cycle. Two hypotheses on how mortality progresses in a tree are proposed in the literature: Manion’s gradual decline hypothesis and Bossel’s sudden death hypothesis. Bossel already formulated a mechanism in his model, BAUMTOD, {{as the cause of}} sudden death phenomena. His model, however, cannot be used to generate a causal understanding to Manion’s hypothesis. Therefore, a causal mechanism for the gradual decline pattern, advocated by Manion, is suggested. BAUMTOD is modified accordingly and the modified model is called BAUMTOD-M. The suggested mechanism concerns the internal imbalance of respiration demand and available photosynthate supply. Then, the eigenvalue elasticity analysis (EEA) is employed to pinpoint how a simulated tree responds to various stresses. It is applied to BAUMTOD and BAUMTOD-M to study the likely structural causes behind tree mortality according to Bossel’s and Manion’s hypotheses, respectively. The analyses of both models suggest that, {{in the absence of a}} significant amount of stress, a tree functions as an <b>integrated</b> <b>organism.</b> Growths in foliage, feeder roots, and respiring permanent biomass are synchronized.

40|$|Nature {{encourages}} {{diversity in}} life forms (morphologies). The study of morphogenesis deals with understanding those processes that arise during the embryonic {{development of an}} organism. These processes control the organized spatial distribution of cells, which in turn {{gives rise to the}} characteristic form for the organism. Morphogenesis is a multi-scale modeling problem that can be studied at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. Here, we study the problem of morphogenesis at the cellular level by introducing an <b>integrated</b> <b>biomechanical</b> model of cells embedded in the extracellular matrix. The fundamental aspects of mechanobiology essential for studying morphogenesis at the cellular level are the cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix (ECM), and cell adhesion. Cells are modeled using tensegrity architecture. Our simulations demonstrate cellular events, such as differentiation, migration, and division using an extended tensegrity architecture that supports dynamic polymerization of the micro-filaments of the cell. Thus, our simulations add further support to the cellular tensegrity model. Viscoelastic behavior of extracellular matrix is modeled by extending one-dimensional mechanical models (by Maxwell and by Voigt) to three dimensions using finite element methods. The cell adhesion is modeled as a general Velcro-type model. We integrated the mechanics and dynamics of cell, ECM, and cell adhesion with a geometric model to create an <b>integrated</b> <b>biomechanical</b> model. In addition, the thesis discusses various computational issues, including generating the finite element mesh, mesh refinement, re-meshing, and solution mapping.

40|$|To {{establish}} and maintain organ structure and function, tissues need to balance stem cell proliferation and differentiation rates and coordinate cell fate with position. By quantifying and modelling tissue stress and deformation in the mammalian epidermis, we find that this balance is coordinated through local mechanical forces generated by cell division and delamination. Proliferation within the basal stem/progenitor layer, which displays features of a jammed, solid-like state, leads to crowding, thereby locally distorting cell shape and stress distribution. The resulting decrease in cortical tension and increased cell-cell adhesion trigger differentiation and subsequent delamination, reinstating basal cell layer density. After delamination, cells establish a high-tension state as they increase myosin II activity and convert to E-cadherin-dominated adhesion, thereby reinforcing the boundary between basal and suprabasal layers.

The virtually simultaneous appearance of all the lineages except Cynodontia in the Middle Permian stratigraphic record supports the hypothesis. The palaeogeographic record, which shows a combination of taxa with first occurrences in different parts of Pangaea also supports it, though this is not strong evidence. The palaeoenvironmental record supports the polytomous hypothesis strongly by providing evidence of a coincidence between the start of the therapsid radiation and the appearance of a new suite of ecological opportunities for diversification within higher latitudes. Finally, a functional correlation analysis of the characters associated with feeding, and the reconstruction of lineages of functionally <b>integrated</b> <b>organisms</b> offers strong support by indicating that no two of the four respective lineages, Dinocephalia, Gorgonopsia, Anomodontia and Therocephalia, could have shared a functionally feasible common ancestral stage subsequent to a hypothetical ancestor at a biarmosuchian grade.

Multicellular volvocalean species including Gonium pectorale and Volvox carteri generally have several common morphological features to survive as <b>integrated</b> multicellular <b>organisms</b> such as "rotational asymmetry of cells" so that the cells become components of the individual and "cytoplasmic bridges between protoplasts in developing embryos" to maintain the species-specific form of the multicellular individual before secretion of new extracellular matrix (ECM). However, these morphological features have not been studied in the four-celled colonial volvocine species Tetrabaena socialis that is positioned in the most basal lineage within the colonial or multicellular volvocine greens. Here we established synchronous cultures of T. socialis and carried out immunofluorescence microscopic and ultrastructural observations to elucidate these two morphological attributes. Based on immunofluorescence microscopy, four cells of the mature T. socialis colony were identical in morphology but had rotational asymmetry in arrangement of microtubular rootlets and separation of basal bodies like G. pectorale and V. carteri. Ultrastructural observations clearly confirmed the presence of cytoplasmic bridges between protoplasts in developing embryos of T. socialis even after the formation of new flagella in each daughter protoplast within the parental ECM. Therefore, these two morphological attributes might have evolved in the common four-celled ancestor of the colonial volvocine algae and contributed to the further increase in cell number and complexity of the multicellular individuals of this model lineage.

40|$|Birds {{are some}} of the most {{familiar}} organisms of global ecosystems. Changes in the visibility and abundance of birds are therefore excellent indicators of population and physiological responses to habitat changes and are a major focus for public concern about detrimental environmental changes. In order to understand how birds respond to these challenges, it is essential to determine how the environment affects reproduction under natural conditions. The continuum from environmental variables (cues) to reproductive life-history traits depends upon a cascade of neural and physiological processes that determine the extent and rate at which birds will be able to adapt to changes in their environment. For a full understanding of this ability to adapt, ecologists and endocrinologists need to collaborate and build a common framework. The objective of this theme issue is to bring together a series of papers addressing how evolutionary ecologists and endocrinologists can collaborate directly using avian reproduction as a model system. First, we address the need to integrate ecology and endocrinology and what benefits to biological knowledge will be gained. The papers collected in this issue represent a new synthesis of ecology and endocrinology as discussed in three E-BIRD workshops. The three main foci are trade-offs and constraints, maternal effects and individual variation. Authors within each group present ecological and endocrinological aspects of their topics and many go on to outline testable hypotheses. Finally, we discuss where the major problems remain and how this issue points out where these need collaborative efforts of ecologists and endocrinologists. Specific challenges are raised to future researchers to break through intellectual barriers and explore new frontiers. This framework of topics will ultimately apply to all taxa because the principles involved are universal and hopefully will have direct application to programmes <b>integrating</b> <b>organisms</b> and genes throughout biological sciences. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary Tree {{mortality}} {{is the least}} understood process of a tree’s lifecycle. Two hypotheses on how mortality progresses in a tree are proposed in the literature: Manion’s gradual de-cline hypothesis and Bossel’s sudden death hypothesis. Bossel formulated a mechanism in his model, BAUMTOD, {{as the cause of}} sudden death phenomena. BAUMTOD, however, can-not be used to generate a causal understanding of Manion’s hy-pothesis. Therefore, we postulated a causal mechanism for the gradual decline pattern advocated by Manion and modified the BAUMTOD accordingly. The modified model is called BAUMTOD-M. The suggested mechanism concerns the inter-nal imbalance of respiration demand and available photosyn-thate supply. We then employed a novel approach to analysis of structure–behavior relationships in mechanistic models, called eigenvalue elasticity analysis (EEA), to pinpoint how the sim-ulated tree responds to various stresses. Specifically, we ap-plied EEA to BAUMTOD and BAUMTOD-M to study the likely structural causes behind tree mortality according to Bossel’s and Manion’s hypotheses, respectively. The analyses of both models suggest that, {{in the absence of a}} significant amount of stress, a tree functions as an <b>integrated</b> <b>organism.</b> Growth rates in foliage, feeder roots and respiring permanent biomass are synchronized; however, this coordinated structure is lost if a tree is seriously affected by stress factors. The analy-ses further suggest that the inability to supply respiration de-mand plays a crucial role at the onset of mortality in both models. Differences in assumed mechanisms regarding the im-pact of this inability result in different paths to mortality in each model. This may mean either (1) Bossel’s hypothesis is a spe-cial case of Manion’s hypothesis, or (2) there are truly different mechanisms at work in various observed mortality cases.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} plant {{functional}} genomics {{is to describe}} the patterns of gene expression and internal plant function underlying the ecological functions that sustain plant growth and reproduction. Plants function as integrated systems in which metabolic and developmental pathways draw on common resource pools and respond to {{a relatively small number}} of signal/response systems. Plants are also integrated with their environment, exchanging energy and matter with their surroundings and are consequently sensitive to changes in energy and resource fluxes. These two levels of integration complicate the description of gene function. Internal integration results in single genes often affecting multiple characteristics (pleiotropy) and interacting with multiple other genes (epistasis). Integration with the external environment leads to gene expression and the genes' phenotypic effects varying across environmental backgrounds (gene-environment interaction). An accurate description of the function of all genes requires an augmentation, already underway, of the study of isolated developmental and metabolic pathways to a more integrated approach involving the study of genetic effects across scales of variation usually regarded as the purview of ecological and evolutionary research. Since the evolution of gene function also depends on this complex of gene effects, progress in evolutionary genetics will also require understanding the nature of gene interactions and pleiotropy and the constraints and patterns they impose on adaptive evolution. Studying gene function in the context of the <b>integrated</b> <b>organism</b> is a major challenge, best met by developing co-ordinated research efforts in model systems.
