50|$|Large {{versions}} of these clips, called automotive clips or <b>battery</b> <b>clamps,</b> {{are made of}} solid copper for low electrical resistance, and are used with thick insulated copper cables to make connections between automobile batteries. These jumper cables are capable of delivering hundreds of Amperes of current needed to directly power an automobile starter motor, or to transfer energy from a charged lead-acid battery to a discharged one.|$|R
5000|$|The calibre 1611 ‘Albatross’ (designated {{so because}} of {{the shape of the}} <b>battery</b> <b>clamping</b> system {{resembling}} an albatross's wings) was designed by Raymond Froidevaux. The movement had one large circuit on the rear of the watch which controlled both the analogue movement (based on calibre 1320) [...] and digital LCD elements. The Chrono Quartz was originally ran on two mercury 323 running time of 26 months, this was replaced by the silver oxide battery 393 running time 15 months. The watch was not designed for intricate repair but more as a modular system, which would be replaced dependent on the components required. Working versions of the watch were available in 1975 but Omega did not release the watch until 1976.|$|R
50|$|The {{same night}} at the coroner's office, the coroner {{examines}} Ray's dead body apparently having been bitten by venomous snakes - presumed to be water snakes. The coroner leaves the area and comes back to see Ray's body missing and then he is killed by Ray's possessed body. Deputy Turner is also killed while returning Ray's tow truck to the shop. The next day Eden is still recuperating from the night before. She visits her father's grave in the cemetery, and sees Ray's tow truck driving by. Rachel and her boyfriend, Sean, are at the lake, with Sean showing little emotion to Ray's death. He drank heavily leading to him ditching Rachel with Eden and having Eric chase after him. Meanwhile, Tammy and Patty are planning {{to go to the}} mall to shoplift and they come across Ray's towing business. Patty goes to pee, while Tammy fixes the tires. When she is done, Tammy goes to look for Patty, only to find her impaled by <b>battery</b> <b>clamps</b> attached to chains leaving her to hang. Tammy tries to escape but Ray traps her in the garage and crushes her torso with a lowered car and then sandblasts her face off with a blasting pump.|$|R
40|$|A study {{consisting}} of electrochemical characterization and Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) cycling of Li-Ion cells from three vendors was initiated in 1999 {{to determine the}} cycling performance and to infuse the new technology in the future NASA missions. The 8 -cell batteries included in this evaluation are prismatic cells manufactured by Mine Safety Appliances Company (MSA), cylindrical cells manufactured by SAFT and prismatic cells manufactured by Yardney Technical Products, Inc. (YTP). The three batteries were cycle tested in the LEO regime at 40 % depth of discharge, and under a charge control technique that consists of <b>battery</b> voltage <b>clamp</b> with a current taper. The initial testing was conducted at 20 C; however, the batteries were cycled also intermittently at low temperatures. YTP 20 Ah cells consisted of mixed-oxide (Co and Ni) positive, graphitic carbon negative, LIPF 6 salt mixed with organic carbonate solvents. The <b>battery</b> voltage <b>clamp</b> was 32 V. The low temperature cycling tests started after 4575 cycles at 20 C. The cells were not capable of cycling. at low temperature since the charge acceptance at battery level was poor. There was a cell in the battery that showed too high an end-of-charge (EOC) voltage thereby limiting the ability to charge {{the rest of the}} cells in the battery. The battery has completed 6714 cycles. SAFT 12 Ah cells consisted of mixed-oxide (Co and NO positive, graphitic carbon negative, LiPF 6 salt mixed with organic carbonate solvents. The <b>battery</b> voltage <b>clamp</b> was for 30. 8 V. The low temperature cycling tests started after 4594 cycles at 20 C. A cell that showed low end of discharge (EOD) and EOC voltages and three other cells that showed higher EOC voltages limited the charge acceptance at the selected voltage limit during charge. The cells were capable of cycling at 10 C and 0 C but the charge voltage limit had to be increased to 34. 3 V (4. 3 V per cell). The low temperature cycling may have induced poor chargeability since the voltage had to be increased to achieve the required charge input. The battery has completed 6226 cycles. MSA 10 Ah cells consisted of Co oxide positive, graphitic carbon negative, LiPF 6 salt mixed with organic carbonate solvents. The <b>battery</b> voltage <b>clamp</b> was 30. 8 V. The low temperature cycling tests were started after 2182 cycles at 20 C. The cells were capable of cycling at 10 C and 0 C. Like SAFT, the voltage limit on charge had to be increased to 36 V (4. 5 V per cell). There was a cell (cell S/N 13) in the battery that showed poor performance features such as low EOD voltage and high EOC voltage. The battery has completed 3441 cycles. A reconditioning procedure that consisted of C 15 charge to a taper current of C/ 100 and C/ 20 discharge improved the voltage behavior of SAFT and MSA cells with no significant effect on YTP cells. We have demonstrated that the charge operation with VT <b>clamp</b> at <b>battery</b> rather than at cell level is feasible for onboard Li-Ion battery operation...|$|R

The van is described as having room for 3 operators and one squadron radio officer. One bench supports the SCR-67, SCR-54, and 1 amplifier with storage <b>batteries</b> held by <b>clamps</b> underneath the bench. on another bench is the SCR-79. a desk for the officer is installed with batteries underneath. a 6 volt circuit is provided for 2 lamps connected to storage batteries, and a 110 volt circuit with 2 lamps is provided if there is an external power source available.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Li-ion {{battery is}} used widely in many {{industrial}} areas, and formation {{is a necessary}} process in battery manufacture. After formation, the performance of Li-ion power batteries can be activated. In the process of production, the key technology in the formation has been changed. The technology of formation and holding independently for each battery is turning into the formation after being clamped and then holding now. Therefore, {{the design of the}} automatic production line must base on the battery groups after being clamped. This text will introduce a new production line for the formation of Li-ion battery, mainly discuss the formation of <b>clamped</b> <b>batteries,</b> and how to realize the automation of the production line. The line uses the three-dimensional multi-layer frameworks, speed-fold chains and stoppers. The speed-fold chain is a new type of conveyor chain, and known as "flexible manufacturing unit". The battery groups can be stopped in the manufacturing line by the stoppers, and then they can be charged or discharged. The line can be connected by the lifting machine...|$|R
