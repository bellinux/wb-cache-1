In this direction, a new technology is being developed which has the potential payoff in the difficult subsystem of imaging payloads. A class of inorganic polymers, called geopolymers, is being tested for their use as lightweight mirror materials. Two formulations, one for use as an adhesive {{and the other one}} for use as a structural material, are under development and are <b>being</b> <b>space</b> <b>qualified</b> as part of this overall effort. Geopolymers have the advantages of low initial coefficient of thermal expansion, easy preparation at room temperature and atmospheric conditions, castability, and adhesion to a number of common mirror coating materials. If successful, geopolymer based optics have the potential to improve the areal densities of traditional monolithic glass mirrors by a factor of 3 or more.

Guided by these criteria, a SMP biaxial tubular braid applying MCP through active compression was designed and the prototype manufacturing processes were outlined. To predict the pressure production of this garment, the thermo-mechanics of a SMP was combined with the textile mechanics of a biaxial tubular braid and simulated within design parameter ranges consistent with the design criteria and practical considerations. The pressure production was controllable with the design parameters SMP elastic modulus, garment radial deformation, textile fiber spacing, and operational temperature. Assuming reasonable model accuracy, a SMP garment could achieve the necessary pressure production for a <b>space</b> <b>qualified</b> MCP suit, however, the durability of such a garment would be questionable considering the creep sustained from consecutive spacewalks of four to eight hours. Recommendations are made for methods to increase model accuracy, suggested SMP actuation mechanisms, and alternative textile architectures. by Brian Wee. Thesis (S. B.)
