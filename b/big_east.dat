5|$|Following {{the rivalry}} game win, Cincinnati played the Pittsburgh Panthers {{in a game}} for control of {{first place in the}} <b>Big</b> <b>East.</b> In front of a record crowd at Cincinnati's home field, the Bearcats claimed first place with a 28–21 win. Heading into its game against the Syracuse Orange, Cincinnati was assured at least a share of the <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Championship, but a 30–10 win over Syracuse gave the Bearcats sole {{possession}} of the championship, the first <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> title in school history. After clinching the <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Championship and a bid to a BCS bowl, Cincinnati ended the regular season with a game in Hawaii against the Hawaii Warriors.

Prior to the season, the <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> had {{signed an agreement with}} the new San Francisco Bowl, giving that bowl the fifth pick of bowl-eligible teams in the <b>Big</b> <b>East.</b> But with the Gator Bowl (second pick of <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> teams) selecting Notre Dame instead of a <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> team, all the Big East's selections were pushed back one slot. Second-place West Virginia University was pushed to the Continental Tire Bowl (third pick) and third-place Pittsburgh was selected by the Insight Bowl (fourth pick), leaving Virginia Tech to be selected by the San Francisco Bowl with the fifth pick.|$|E

5|$|Louisville, meanwhile, {{returned}} to its winning ways. The Cardinals, following their loss to the Mountaineers, won their first <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> game in school history the next week, over the Cincinnati Bearcats, 46–22. The rout of Cincinnati sparked a five-game winning streak, which concluded on December 3 with a 30–20 victory over the University of Connecticut Huskies. Unfortunately for the Cardinals, starting quarterback Brian Brohm, who had the sixth-best season (in terms of passing yards) in Louisville history, suffered a season-ending knee injury.

5|$|The International Bowl had {{contracts}} with the <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> and Mid-American Conferences {{that allowed them to}} select one team from each conference to participate in their annual game. By virtue of being the <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> champion Cincinnati was awarded an automatic Bowl Championship Series berth; they would play in the 2009 Orange Bowl. The Gator Bowl and Sun Bowl shared the second pick of <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> teams; after the Gator Bowl opted to select Big 12 member Nebraska and the Sun Bowl learned {{that they would not be}} allowed to select Notre Dame, Pittsburgh received the Sun Bowl invitation. The Meineke Car Care Bowl, which had the third selection, picked West Virginia. The fourth, fifth, and sixth selections of <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> teams belonged collectively to the International Bowl, PapaJohns.com Bowl, and St. Petersburg Bowl, which, in consultation with the <b>Big</b> <b>East,</b> decided which schools were the best fit for each bowl. There were three remaining bowl-eligible <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> teams: Connecticut, Rutgers, and South Florida. The previous season, Rutgers had played in the International Bowl and South Florida had appeared in the PapaJohns.com Bowl; bowls in general dislike inviting the same team in consecutive years, on the theory that fans are less likely to want to travel to the same destination they were at the year before. Additionally, the St. Petersburg Bowl, in its inaugural year, sought to have local team South Florida play in their game to drive local attendance. Therefore, the teams were apportioned among the bowls as follows: South Florida to the St. Petersburg Bowl, Rutgers to the PapaJohns.com Bowl, and Connecticut to the International Bowl. On December7,2008, UConn formally accepted the bowl invitation, the third in their history.|$|E
5|$|The loss to Syracuse was {{followed}} by another to Pittsburgh in the following week. The twin losses effectively knocked Tech out of contention for the <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> championship, as the Hokies were then two games behind first-place Miami. Tech won its next two games of the season, but because Miami remained undefeated, the matchup between No. 1 Miami and No. 14 Virginia Tech was played without conference title implications. Before the Miami game, Virginia Tech accepted a bid to the Gator Bowl, which had the first pick of <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> teams after the Bowl Championship Series gave an automatic bid to the <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> champion. Miami defeated Tech in the final regular-season game for both teams, 2624, and the Hokies began preparations for the Gator Bowl.|$|E
