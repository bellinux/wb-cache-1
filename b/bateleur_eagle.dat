40|$|During {{a six-year}} period (from January 2009 to December 2014), {{specimens}} collected from 344 cases of suspected organophosphorus and carbamate pesticide poisonings in wildlife, including birds, were {{submitted to the}} Toxicology Laboratory (ARC-OVI) for analysis. A positive diagnosis was made in 135 (39 %) of these cases. The majority of cases were from birds, which included Cape vultures (Gyps coprotheres) and African white-backed vultures (Gyps africanus) and <b>bateleur</b> <b>eagles</b> (Terathopius ecaudatus). In one incident 49 vultures were killed when a farmer intentionally laced carcasses with carbofuran {{in an attempt to}} control jackal predation. There were 22 incidents of poisoning in helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). On nine different occasions blue cranes (Anthropoides paradiseus) were poisoned, in one incident 14 birds were reported to have been killed. Over the period of investigation, there were 20 cases of poisoning involving mammalian species, the majority being vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus). The carbamate pesticides were responsible for 57 incidents of poisoning. Aldicarb, carbofuran and methomyl were detected in 26, 18 and 12 cases respectively. The majority of organophosphorus pesticide poisonings were caused by diazinon (n = 19), monocrotophos (n = 13) and methamidophos (n = 10) ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>bateleur</b> <b>eagle</b> is {{a common}} to fairly common {{resident}} of the open savanna country and woodland (thornveld) within Sub-Saharan Africa; it also occurs in south-west Arabia. Total distribution size is estimated at 28,000,000 km2. The bird's range has diminished significantly in recent decades, possibly due to poisoning.In April 2012, a juvenile bateleur was seen in Algeciras in southern Spain. This was the first European record for the bateleur.|$|E
50|$|The stone-carved Zimbabwe Bird is the {{national}} emblem of Zimbabwe, appearing on {{the national}} flags and coats of arms of both Zimbabwe and Rhodesia, {{as well as on}} banknotes and coins (first on Rhodesian pound and then Rhodesian dollar). It probably represents the <b>bateleur</b> <b>eagle</b> or the African fish eagle. The bird's design is derived from a number of soapstone sculptures found in the ruins of the ancient city of Great Zimbabwe.|$|E
50|$|Various {{explanations}} {{have been}} advanced {{to explain the}} symbolic meaning of the birds. One suggestion is that each bird was erected in turn to represent a new king, but this would have required improbably long reigns. More probably, the Zimbabwe birds represent sacred or totemic animals of the Shona - the <b>bateleur</b> <b>eagle</b> (Shona: chapengu), which was held to be a messenger from Mwari (God) and the ancestors, or the fish eagle (hungwe) which {{it has been suggested}} was the original totem of the Shona.|$|E
50|$|There {{are over}} 350 species of bird. These include grey-headed kingfisher, sunbirds, bee-eaters, Marabou stork, tawny <b>eagle,</b> Verreaux's <b>eagle,</b> <b>bateleur,</b> vulturine guineafowl, yellow-necked spurfowl, lilac-breasted roller, {{secretary}} bird, superb starling, northern red-billed hornbill, yellow-billed hornbill, and various vultures including the palm-nut vulture.|$|R
50|$|The main predators of {{this species}} are various birds of prey, {{including}} the martial <b>eagle,</b> <b>bateleur,</b> and the Congo serpent eagle. Other predators may include the honey badger, other snakes, and species of mongoose may also occasionally prey on the Jameson's mamba.|$|R
50|$|Elephants and hippos {{might be}} the main {{attraction}} for most visitors, but Liwonde National Park is an important site for birdwatching, with a very different species composition from most of Malawi's avian hotspots. More than 400 species have been recorded. Most notable are the water-associated birds such as the African fish eagle, the pied kingfisher, the saddle-billed stork and goliath heron. This national park {{is one of the}} best places to find a few rarer water-associated birds: among them Pel's fishing owl, red-necked falcon, palm-nut vulture, rufous-bellied heron and white-backed night heron. It is also the only site in Malawi for spur-winged lapwing, a species that had never been recorded in the country until a vagrant pair pitched up in the late 1990s, since when it has established itself along the river in substantial numbers. Away from the water, birds of prey are very well represented. The <b>bateleur,</b> martial <b>eagle</b> and all three snake eagles are quite common and also the southern ground hornbill is present. The park is home to several localised woodland species, such as brown-breasted barbet, Boehm's bee-eater, Lilian's lovebird, Livingstone's flycatcher, collared palm thrush and green twinspot, along with more sparsely distributed mopane specialists such as racket-tailed roller and pale-billed hornbill.|$|R
5000|$|The word kopje in Dutch means [...] "small head" [...] which {{perfectly}} {{describes the}} rock formations {{that seem to}} pop out in the savanna. Kopjes are homes for well adapted animals. The San Diego Zoo's Kopje Woodland in Africa Rocks is home to animals including klipspringers, rock hyrax, and dwarf mongoose. Each animal has well adapted feet {{that allow them to}} cling to the rocks. The exhibit will also include these animals' main predator the <b>bateleur</b> <b>eagle</b> as well as meerkats and servals and the red-leaved rock fig, a tree species that manages to grow wherever its seeds disperse including the rocky kopje.|$|E
5000|$|Some the {{prominent}} bird species {{reported by the}} website of University of Michigan Museum of Zoology are; common swift (Apus apus), kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), grey crowned crane (Balearica regulorum), pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), great spotted cuckoo (Clamator glandarius), South African galago (Galago moholi), Nycteris grandis, martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus), Swynnertonia swynnertoni and black-rumped buttonquail (Turnix nanus). One-third of the world’s eagle species are reported from the Matobo National Park. Buff-spotted flufftail and stripe-cheeked bulbuls are seen across the country. The <b>bateleur</b> <b>eagle</b> is {{the only member of}} the genus Terathopius and probably the origin of the [...] "Zimbabwe Bird", the national emblem of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5000|$|The white {{triangle}} is {{a symbol}} for peace. The golden bird, known as the [...] "Great Zimbabwe Bird" [...] is the national symbol of Zimbabwe [...] and is most likely {{a representation of the}} <b>bateleur</b> <b>eagle</b> or the African fish eagle. It [...] "exemplifies the strong bond that ancestral humans had with animals, nature and spiritual guides" [...] and it is treated {{with a high level of}} importance and respect. The red star represents the nation's aspirations, [...] taken to be socialism as promoted by the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), and whose party flag was used as the basis for the flag of the nation.|$|E
50|$|More {{similar in}} habitat and, locally, prey {{selection}} to martial eagles are three medium-sized eagles, the 1.47 kg African hawk-eagle (Aquila spilogaster), the 2.25 kg tawny eagle (Aquila rapax) and the 2.2 kg bateleur (Terathopius ecaudatus). The biology of martial eagles was compared extensively {{with that of}} these species in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya, where all four were known to prey on large numbers of Kirk's dik-diks (albeit none of these took as many as did the martial eagles and some eaten by <b>bateleurs</b> and tawny <b>eagles</b> are probably scavenged). It {{was found that the}} <b>bateleur</b> and tawny <b>eagle</b> are even broader in their prey composition and take live prey more often of a smaller size, also often coming to and feeding on carrion (which is seldom seen in martial eagles) and pirating from other raptors, especially the tawny eagles. The African hawk-eagle takes fairly similar prey to the martial eagle but does not conflict with martial eagles considering its much smaller size and preference for slightly denser wooded areas. In Tsavo East, 29% of prey of tawny eagle and 21% of bateleur foods were the same that of martial eagles. In east Africa, the breeding season differs mildly between these <b>eagles</b> with <b>bateleurs</b> nesting much earlier than the others and African hawk-eagles breeding peaking slightly later. Thus pressure on shared prey types such as dik-diks are exerted at different times of the year. While the <b>bateleur</b> and tawny <b>eagle</b> can kill prey weighing up to 4 kg and the African hawk-eagle (being relatively large footed and clawed despite its smaller size) can kill prey of up to 5 kg, these raptors are too small to regularly go after live prey as large in the prey spectrum of martial <b>eagles,</b> with the <b>bateleur</b> and tawny having talons relatively smaller even adjusted for their body size (the hawk-eagle’s talons were relatively similar in proportion to their body size). Due to its large size and broad wings, martial eagles are not highly maneuverable in flight and are not infrequently robbed of their catches by these more agile and swift smaller eagles, particularly bold tawny eagles. Other raptors to steal food from martial <b>eagles</b> include <b>bateleurs</b> and even other big species such as Verreaux's eagles and lappet-faced vultures (Torgos tracheliotos). Considering their potential for aggressiveness in regards to prey pursuits, martial eagles can be surprisingly passive in response to kleptoparasitism, especially if they are able to first fill their crop. This may be because they try to avoid unnecessary expenditures of energy in contention over food. Leopards also rarely steal kills from martial eagles but may also be robbed of small kills by martial eagles as have cheetahs. In another case, a martial eagle stole a rock hyrax from a bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus). Prey species are shared by a wide range of birds of prey, both other eagles and other, usually, larger raptors, and mammalian carnivores of many sizes that are too numerous to mention. Some mammalian carnivores such as caracals have superficially similar diets to martial eagles. One other species worth noting is the Verreaux's eagle owl (Bubo lacteus), as it is similarly the largest African owl, weighing about 2.1 kg, with almost identical habitat preferences and distributional range as the martial eagle. Therefore, some consider the eagle owl to be the martial eagle’s nocturnal ecological equivalent. While there is considerable overlap in their diets, there are discrepancies as the eagle owl tends to hunt large numbers of hedgehogs (not known in the eagle’s diet) and occasionally high quantities of mole-rats. When considered this in combination with their different times of activity {{and the fact that the}} eagle owl weighs about half as much as the martial eagle, direct competition probably does not affect either predator in any considerable way.|$|R
5000|$|In Shona, the {{language}} spoken in Zimbabwe, the word mapungu is the plural {{form of the}} word chapungu, denoting the <b>bateleur</b> <b>eagle,</b> which is widely {{believed to be the}} model for the Zimbabwean birds that once graced the massive Great Zimbabwe royal complex. The ending [...] "bwe" [...] is a diminutive of the word [...] "ibwe," [...] which means stone or rock in Shona language. Mapungubwe, in this respect, means the 'rocks of the bateleur eagles'—an indication that there were many bateleurs in the area or location. Chapungu Village in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, which showcases the country's arts and sculpture traditions, is a tribute to the spirit of the bateleur, a bird which has deep religious connotations in Shona culture.|$|E
50|$|Mikumi National Park covers {{an area of}} 3230 km2 (the {{fourth largest}} park in the country) in a 75000 km2 tract of {{wilderness}} that extends east, close to the Indian Ocean.

50|$|Archaeology at Zimbabwe {{has shown}} several {{distinct}} phases of building and styles of stonework. It is likely the original complex was rather functional - essentially a fort and trading post only, and the later and more elaborate building {{occurred when the}} complex became the central administrative and royal centre of activity for the area. Some of the architectural features are probably linked with styles of coastal Swahili architecture and some are uniquely local. Chinese pottery shards, ivory, glass objects, local gold objects, Arabic and local beads, copper ingots, iron ingots and other trade items have been found at Zimbabwe. The herringbone and other stepped linear forms of decoration in the walls are {{a feature of the}} most recent stonework. Similar stonework is seen at Khami ruins, a fort built on the way to Zimbabwe. However, the most impressive and unique feature of Zimbabwe are the huge soapstone birds, the so-called Zimbabwe birds, depicting a bird of prey perched on a zig-zag base motif. These birds are possibly based on the <b>bateleur</b> <b>eagle</b> or maybe a vulture species and might {{have had something to do}} with a religious cult or indicative of a totem animal for the ruling people at the time. Most of these sculptures are still in the country but one is in South Africa where it still adorns Groote Schuur an official residence, once the home of Cecil Rhodes. Another unexplained motif at Zimbabwe, which like the birds were mounted on the perimeter wall of the Great Enclosure, were stelae or tall narrow rectilinear pillars of rock (probably natural fracture artefacts) set at intervals round the top of the wall. The Zimbabwe bird is the most prominent motif of the current Zimbabwe flag.|$|E
40|$|A 32 -year-old adult captive male <b>bateleur</b> <b>eagle</b> (Terathopius ecaudatus) with {{a history}} of laxity, {{degenerative}} joint disease, and varus deviation of the distal left hindlimb for several years was presented for evaluation of left hindlimb lameness and was diagnosed with chronic subluxation of the left intertarsal joint. After failing to improve with conservative management and pain medication, surgical stabilization of the joint was performed using a novel application of a braided suture and titanium button system. Unsatisfactory clinical improvement and postsurgical reevaluation indicated that the initial surgical stabilization was unsuccessful. The surgery was repeated, and the animal showed postsurgical improvement in intertarsal joint stability, weight-bearing, and lameness for a period of several years with use and adjustment of chronic pain medications. The novel surgical technique described in this case report represents an additional treatment option for management of avian intertarsal joint subluxations. Presurgical planning should consider the unique anatomic features and variability of the avian tarsometatarsus to avoid surgical complications...|$|E
40|$|Indigenous {{knowledge}} of seasonal weather forecasting {{could be useful}} in decision making at village level to best exploit the seasonal distribution of rainfall {{in order to increase}} or stabilize crop yields. We examined existing indigenous knowledge by interviewing 192 households in six regions of Uganda. Twenty one distinctive indicators were mentioned by local communities for forecasting the start of the dry season, but only few of these indicators were more consistently and frequently used in the different districts. These included the appearance of bush crickets (Ruspolia baileyi Otte), winds blowing from the east to the west, the appearance and movement of migratory birds such as cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis Linnaeus), and calling by the <b>Bateleur</b> <b>eagle</b> (Terathopius ecaudatus Lesson). For prediction of the start of the rainy season, 22 indicators were mentioned and these included winds blowing from the west to the east, cuckoo birds (Cuculiformes: Cuculidae) start to call, and winged African termite (Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki) swarms leave their nests. Predictors of rain in the following days included presence of red clouds in the morning. Together with the meteorological forecasts, traditional indicators could be very useful in rain forecasting and improving the timing of agricultural activities...|$|E
