5|$|In early May, an upper-level trough dropped southward {{through the}} western Atlantic Ocean, forcing a <b>back-door</b> cold front—a cold front that moves southwestward {{ahead of a}} {{building}} surface ridge to its north or northeast—southward. For several days, forecast models had anticipated for the trough to evolve into a closed low pressure area, and on May 6, a frontal low with a large and well-defined circulation developed about 90miles (140km) east of Cape Hatteras. The low maintained scattered convection around its circulation center, and {{in conjunction with the}} strong high pressure to its north, a very tight pressure gradient produced gale-force winds near the coastline. The extratropical storm tracked southeastward and later turned to the southwest while steadily deepening; on May 7, it attained hurricane-force winds. With a lack of tropical moisture, its corresponding convection was minimal and scattered.|$|E

He also assisted in the equipping of the Argentinean corvette Uruguay, which was being fitted out for the relief of the stranded Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Nordenskiöld. In search of more permanent employment, Shackleton applied for a regular commission in the Royal Navy, via the <b>back-door</b> route of the Supplementary List, but despite the sponsorship of Markham and {{of the president of the}} Royal Society, he was not successful. Instead, he became a journalist, working for the Royal Magazine, but he found this unsatisfactory. He was then offered, and accepted, the secretaryship of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS), a post which he took up on 11 January 1904. On 9 April 1904 he married Emily Dorman, with whom he had three children: Raymond, Cecily, and Edward.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} value perceptions and consumption behaviors of sneakerheads who are mixed-role resellers of sneakers. “Sneakerhead” is a term given to those who collect and wear sneakers with a vast amount of effort and resources (Semmelhack, Garcia, Lepri, Willis, & Hatfield, 2015). “Mixed-role resellers” is a term given to individuals who collect, use, and resell consumer goods (Chu & Liao, 2007). Traditional consumer behavior frameworks mostly focus on behaviors surrounding pre-acquisition, purchase, and use of goods initially purchased by the consumer for his or her own use (Boyd & McConocha, 1996). These frameworks do not necessarily explain behaviors surrounding goods initially purchased with the intention to resell to others, such as researching predicted resale value during pre-acquisition, using controversial methods to obtain products during acquisition, and taking special measure to keep a product in pristine condition. While the resale market has expanded due to internet and social media, resale behavior has not drawn much attention from researchers. To address this gap, the author took a qualitative approach to gain an understanding of value perception and behaviors when consumers purchase goods with the intention to resell. The three research questions are: 1) 	What factors into mixed-role reseller sneakerheads’ perception of a sneaker’s value? 2) 	What behaviors are exhibited by mixed-role reseller sneakerheads during pre-acquisition, acquisition, physical possession, and resale of the sneakers they intend to resell; what motivates these behaviors? 3) 	What do mixed-role reseller sneakerheads like and dislike about the sneaker resale market? A total of 25 in-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. Interviewees were recruited through posts on sneakerhead community websites and snowball sampling. To qualify for participation in the study, interviewees needed to fit the description of a sneakerhead and a mixed-role reseller of sneakers. Results show how the interviewees evaluate the value of sneakers they intend to resell, what behaviors interviewees exhibit during the pre-acquisition, acquisition, physical possession, and disposition stages pertaining to sneakers they intend to resell, and how the interviewees felt about the resale market in general. First, data show that sneakers can hold monetary, emotional, functional, and/or social value. Most discussion about sneaker value centered on monetary value. Findings show that interviewees’ perceptions of monetary value were influenced by sneaker model rarity, celebrity endorsement of sneakers, collaboration between brands and celebrities, retro marketing, and sneaker condition. Second, the interviewees who purchased sneakers with resale intention demonstrated behaviors that are noteworthy in various stages of the Inventory Ownership Cycle (IOC) (Boyd & McConocha, 1996). When interviewees considered purchasing sneakers they intended to resale, they did an extensive information search prior to purchase to predict resale price, purchased multiple pairs with controversial methods (e. g., using bots and <b>back-dooring),</b> did not wear or carefully wore the sneakers, utilized various resale channel (e. g., eBay, social media, and mobile applications), and took measures to minimize physical and financial risks of reselling. Third, data show that while interviewees often had both positive and negative affects towards the resale market, they tended to have more negative affects towards resellers who used controversial methods to acquire sneakers. However, the interviewees seemed to accept these negative aspects of the resale market and said nothing can be done to change it. This study has implications for both researchers and business practitioners. For researchers in consumer behavior, this study provides insight into how resale intention can influence behaviors throughout the IOC (Boyd & McConocha, 1996). For business practitioners, findings from this study call attention to the need to consider consumers who purchase for personal use and consumers who purchase for resale as different market segments. It also calls out the need for brand managers to preserve this unique consumer culture and reduce negative outcomes caused by reselling...|$|R
25|$|This is {{a matter}} of vital {{importance}} because a problem of economic development is identifying the membership of customary landowning groups and the owners. Disputes between mining and forestry companies and landowner groups often devolve on the issue of whether the companies entered into contractual relations for the use of land with the true owners. Customary property — usually land — cannot be devised by will. It can only be inherited according to the custom of the deceased's people. The Lands Act was amended in 2010 along with the Land Group Incorporation Act, intended to improve the management of state land, mechanisms for dispute resolution over land, and to enable customary landowners to be better able to access finance and possible partnerships over portions of their land, if they seek to develop it for urban or rural economic activities. The Land Group Incorporation Act requires more specific identification of the customary landowners than hitherto and their more specific authorisation before any land arrangements are determined; (a major issue {{in recent years has been}} a land grab, using, or rather misusing, the Lease-Leaseback provision under the Land Act, notably using 'Special Agricultural and Business Leases' (SABLs) to acquire vast tracts of customary land, purportedly for agricultural projects, but in an almost all cases as a <b>back-door</b> mechanism for securing tropical forest resources for logging — circumventing the more exacting requirements of the Forest Act, for securing Timber Permits (which must comply with sustainability requirements and be competitively secured, and with the customary landowners approval).

Entering the game, the last four Ivy League representatives in the tournament had lost in the first round by an average of 35 points. During the game, Mueller's defensive assignment was Mourning, and he contributed 9 points and 8 assists to Princeton's 49-point effort. [...] During the game, Mueller played beyond the foul line on the offensive end, forcing Mourning to leave passing lanes open for <b>back-door</b> attacks. Although the strategy enabled Princeton to stay in the game, Mourning had seven blocked shots, including two in the final fifteen seconds. Mueller's final shot was deflected by Mourning, which is remembered by Princeton fans as an uncalled foul. [...] The team finished with a 198 (113) record. Later in the same tournament, Duke would use Christian Laettner at the top of the key, like Princeton had used Mueller, and eliminate Georgetown by shutting down Mourning.
