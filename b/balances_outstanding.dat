40|$|This paper solves {{a dynamic}} {{model of a}} household’s {{decision}} to default on its mortgage, taking into account labor income, house price, in‡ation, and interest rate risk. Mortgage default is triggered by negative home equity, which results from declining house prices in a low in‡ation environment with large mortgage <b>balances</b> <b>outstanding.</b> Not all households with negative home equity default, however. The level of negative home equity that triggers default depends {{on the extent to}} which households are borrowing constrained. High loan-to-value ratios at mortgage origination increase the probability of negative home equity. High loan-to-income ratios also increase the probability of default by tightening borrowing constraints. Comparing mortgage types, adjustable-rate mortgage defaults occur when nominal interest rates increase and are substantially a¤ected by idiosyncratic shocks to labor income. Fixed-rate mortgages default when interest rates and in‡ation are low, and create a higher probability of a default wave with a large number of defaults. Interest-only mortgages trade o ¤ an increased probability of negative home equity against a relaxation of borrowing constraints, but overall have the highest Many di¤erent factors contributed to the global …nancial crisis of 2007 - 09.

40|$|Molecular {{modelling}} {{suggests that}} a group of proteins in plants known as the β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases, or the hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase superfamily, includes enzymes that reduce succinic semialdehyde and glyoxylate to γ-hydroxybutyrate and glycolate respectively. Recent biochemical and expression studies reveal that NADPH-dependent cytosolic (termed GLYR 1) and plastidial (termed GLYR 2) isoforms of suc-cinic semialdehyde/glyoxylate reductase exist in Arabidopsis. Succinic semialdehyde and glyoxylate are typically generated in leaves via two distinct metabolic pathways, γ-aminobutyrate and glycolate respectively.

Several papers devoted to advanced market economies show that a stronger primary balance is associated with a lower cost of debt servicing. The interest cost of servicing the public debt is key both to its sustainability and to the burden it places on the public finances and the economy. A panel of four transition economies: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia in the time period 1994 - 2002 has been analyzed. The question is if also in these countries much of the variation in the costs of servicing public debt can be explained in terms of fundamentals that determine the debt dynamics.

40|$|A {{consequence}} of the recent house price falls is that some households will {{find themselves in the}} situation where they owe more than their houses are worth. In other words they are in negative equity. Having peaked in early 2007 house prices in Ireland have fallen steadily. By July 2009 house prices were down 24 per cent from their peak in early 2007. Estimates of the number in negative equity range from around 140, 000 home owners in November 2008 to 150, 000 households in August 2009. 3 A mortgage borrower is in negative equity if a drop in house prices results {{in the value of the}} house being lower than the outstanding debt. The level of debt remaining depends on the initial price paid, the initial loan and any equity, given the loan-to-value ratio, as well as any reduction in the capital <b>balance</b> <b>outstanding</b> as a result of mortgage repayments. Some borrowers will also benefit from equity accumulated from any house price increases that occurred after they purchased their house...|$|R
