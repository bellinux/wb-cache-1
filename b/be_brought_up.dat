5|$|With {{her older}} sister, Elizabeth, Anne {{was sent to}} be raised at Güstrow in Germany by her {{maternal}} grandparents, the Duke and Duchess of Mecklenburg. Compared with the roving Danish court, where King Frederick was notorious for gargantuan meals, heavy drinking and restless behaviour (including marital infidelity), Güstrow provided Anne with a frugal and stable life during her early childhood. Christian was also sent to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> at Güstrow but two years later, in 1579, the Rigsraad (Danish Privy Council) successfully requested his removal to Denmark, and Anne and Elizabeth returned with him.|$|E
5|$|During World War II the {{battalion}} {{was sent to}} New Guinea in 1942 {{as part of the}} 30th Brigade to defend the territory against a Japanese attack. Subsequently, between July and August of that year the unit was heavily engaged in the defence of Port Moresby, fighting along the Kokoda Track. The 39th fought several desperate actions against the Japanese as they attempted to hold out until further reinforcements could <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> from Port Moresby. They were also later involved in the fighting around Buna–Gona. Such was their involvement in the battle that {{by the time they were}} withdrawn they could only muster 32 men and following its return to Australia, the unit was disbanded in early July 1943.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the advance}} to the Hongorai, {{there was a pause}} of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be {{improved}} and supplies to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up,</b> before attempting to cross the Hongorai en masse. This allowed Savige to re-evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. As they waited for the advance to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and {{there were a couple of}} significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as Egan's Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis of advance.|$|E

5|$|George and {{his father}} sailed for England from The Hague on 16/27 September 1714 and arrived at Greenwich two days later. The {{following}} day, they formally entered London in a ceremonial procession. George was given the title of Prince of Wales. Caroline followed her husband to Britain in October with their daughters, while Frederick remained in Hanover to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> by private tutors. London was like nothing George had seen before: it was 50 times larger than Hanover, and the crowd was estimated at up to {{one and a half}} million spectators. George courted popularity with voluble expressions of praise for the English, and claimed that he had no drop of blood that was not English.|$|E
5|$|In December 1915 Braithwaite was {{promoted}} temporary brigadier general (his temporary rank of lieutenant colonel was made substantive {{at the same}} time) and took command of the newly formed New Zealand (Rifle) Brigade. The brigade consisted of only two battalions at this stage but would <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> to strength {{with the arrival of}} its 3rd and 4th Battalions in March 1916. During this time Braithwaite oversaw the training of his new command. However, within a few months, he was appointed commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, one of the three brigades of the newly formed New Zealand Division.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the success of the {{offensive}} in this sector was the failure of Falkenhausen to employ a defence in depth. In theory, the enemy would be allowed to make initial gains, thus stretching their lines of communication. Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the initial advance had bogged down, before enemy reinforcements could <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up.</b> The defenders would thus be able to counter-attack and regain any lost territory. In this sector, Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front and they were too late for a useful counter-attack on either 10 or 11 April.|$|E

5|$|Owers' Corner {{was named}} after Lieutenant Noel Owers, who was given the task of {{surveying}} a new route from Ilolo to Nauro. The project of constructing a jeep track to Nauro was pushed aggressively by the Chief Engineer at New Guinea Force, Brigadier John Main. Lieutenant Colonel Sidney Bleechmore was placed in charge, and was given the 7th and 2/14th Field Companies and {{a section of the}} 2/1st Mechanical Equipment Company. Work commenced on 19 August. Removing the trees allowed the sun to dry out the ground, and by adding drainage, a track was created passable by light vehicles, allowing plant and equipment to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up.</b> Owers' Corner was reached in early September.|$|E
5|$|Theophilos {{found himself}} {{isolated}} with his tagmata and the Kurds {{on the hill}} of Anzen. The Arabs proceeded to surround the hill, but the Byzantines were saved by a sudden rain, which loosened the strings of the Turkish bows, rendering them useless. Afshin then sent for catapults to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> to batter the Byzantine position. At the same time, Theophilos's officers, afraid of treachery by the Kurdish troops, persuaded him to withdraw. Breaking through the Arab lines and suffering many wounds in the process (the sources variously credit Manuel, who was severely wounded and possibly died soon after, and Theophobos for saving the Emperor), Theophilos and his small escort managed to reach safety at Chiliokomon, where he gradually re-assembled the remnants of his army.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{supply was}} entirely by sea. Amphibian scouts from the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR) of the US 2nd Engineer Special Brigade, wearing Australian uniforms, {{advanced}} with the infantry and reconnoitred beaches from the landward side {{as they were}} secured. If a beach looked suitable, a second reconnaissance was made from the sea. Once a beach was selected, a shore party was brought in by landing craft {{to set up an}} administrative area. Engineers improved the coastal track to enable supplies to units moving along it to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> by jeeps but supplies for units moving inland over the high ground had to be brought by native carriers. Artillery guns were brought forward over the tracks, or else were moved by Landing Craft Mechanised (LCMs) of the 532nd EBSR. Tanks normally moved along the tracks but used LCMs to bypass obstacles. As the advance continued, new beachheads were opened up while rearward ones were closed. The advance was halted on occasion to allow for the guns to be brought forward or sufficient supplies to be accumulated at the forward beachhead.|$|E

5|$|Although the Japanese were {{experiencing}} similar problems {{in relation to}} supplies, they began their advance once again on 26 August and despite several rugged defensive actions the Australians were forced back again, first to Eora Creek on 30 August, then Templeton's Crossing on 2 September, and finally to Efogi three days later. Exhausted from their efforts and {{no longer able to}} be considered an effective fighting force, the 39th was relieved and sent down the track to Koitaki to rest. They had done the job that was required of them, having stalled the Japanese advance in order to allow reinforcements to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up.</b> These reinforcements came {{in the shape of the}} 25th Brigade, comprising the 2/25th, 2/31st and 2/33rd Battalions. Bitter fighting ensued around Ioribaiwa and the Australians withdrew once again on 17 September, this time to Imita Ridge; however, the Japanese had reached their limit and on 24 September began to withdraw. The Australians subsequently launched a counter-offensive in October and by 2 November, Kokoda was back in Australian hands.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1943, Lieutenant Colonel Derek Mills-Roberts {{arrived from}} the United Kingdom {{to take over the}} unit, and he was in command when on 26 February 1943 they were {{involved}} in bitter fighting against two battalions of German parachute infantry with armoured support which attacked their position as part of an attempt to encircle the 1st Army by cutting the Medjez road. In a fight that lasted over five hours, against an enemy that outnumbered them and had the advantage of heavy armoured support, the commandos, along with elements from the Reconnaissance Regiment, were able to stop the advance long enough for reinforcements to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up.</b> In this action, No. 6 Commando incurred 11 killed, 34 wounded and 55 missing in action. This represented over 40 per cent of the unit's strength at the time, although later a number of those that were captured were recovered after the Germans withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Resulting {{from the}} 1986 Popplewell Report into {{the safety of}} sports grounds and the later Taylor Report, the {{capacity}} of St Andrew's was set at 28,235 for safety reasons, but it was accepted that the stadium had to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> to modern all-seated standards. After the last home game of the 1993–94 season, the Kop and Tilton Road terraces were demolished– fans took home a significant proportion as souvenirs– to be replaced {{at the start of}} the new season by a 7,000-seat Tilton Road Stand, continuing round the corner into the 9,500-seat Kop which opened two months later. The 8,000-seat Railway Stand followed in 1999; ten years later, this was renamed the Gil Merrick Stand, in honour of the club's appearance record-holder and former manager– but the Main Stand has still to be modernised. In 2017, the club website listed the stadium capacity as 29,409.|$|E

5|$|The terrain {{over which}} the two brigades were to advance was {{generally}} steep with the track having been cut along a high spur line that dropped on either side into deep ravines that were covered by kunai grass interspersed with areas of thick jungle. North of Bonga, the ground was markedly different, with the track having been pushed through flat swamp land that was punctuated by many deep creeks; vegetation in the area was mainly thick secondary growth, although to the west, in the steep hills, kunai grass was predominate. As {{a result of the}} harsh conditions and terrain, as the Australian advance continued it was increasingly hampered by vehicle break downs and fatigue amongst their crews. Resupply was also a problem for the Australians and consequently a lack of spare parts developed. This meant that a number of jeeps became unserviceable and some of the Matilda tanks were unable to advance for some time while their crews waited for parts to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
5|$|Childhood {{mortality}} {{was high}} in Medieval Scotland. Children were often baptised rapidly, by laymen and occasionally by midwives, {{because of the}} belief that unbaptised children would be dammed. It was more normally undertaken in a church and was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with godparents. Cemeteries may not represent {{a cross section of}} Medieval society, but in one Aberdeen cemetery 53 per cent of those buried were under the age of six and in one Linlithgow cemetery it was 58 per cent. Iron deficiency anaemia seems to have been common among children, probably caused by long-term breastfeeding by mothers that were themselves deficient in minerals. Common childhood diseases included measles, diphtheria and whooping-cough, while parasites were also common. In Lowland noble and wealthy society by the fifteenth century the practice of wet-nursing had become common. In Highland society there was a system of fosterage among clan leaders, where boys and girls would leave their parent's house to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> in that of other chiefs, creating a fictive bond of kinship that helped cement alliances and mutual bonds of obligation. The majority of children, even in urban centres where opportunities for formal education were greatest, did not attend school. In the families of craftsmen children probably carried out simpler tasks. They might later become apprentices or journeymen. In Lowland rural society, as in England, many young people, both male and female, probably left home to become domestic and agricultural servants, as they can be seen doing in large numbers from the sixteenth century. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life-cycle service and late marriage, usually in the mid-20s, delayed by the need to acquire the resources to be able to form a household.|$|E
5|$|Libby and Dan {{protest against}} the {{decision}} and Susan tries blackmailing a senior board member. The board change their minds and Susan becomes pregnant. Dan {{finds it hard to}} relate to Susan and begins to question her part in his and Libby's lives. Karl books a holiday for them all to get away and talk. Dan and Susan argue about where the baby will <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> and Dan says that he regrets agreeing to the surrogacy. When Dan goes for a walk, Susan follows him and they continue to argue. Dan walks away and Susan tries running after him, but she trips and falls. She calls out, but Dan does not hear her and he walks off. Libby and Karl find Susan and rush her to the hospital, where Susan miscarries. Susan attends the memorial for Libby and Dan's baby and during Dan's speech, she lashes out at him. As everyone leaves the park, Susan collapses and reveals that she cannot feel her legs. Susan has an MS relapse, but she recovers. Susan and Karl take up golf, and Susan also enrols in a media course at Eden Hills University. She begins receiving threats, which tell her to leave the university. Susan is deeply upset by the threats and her family worry that the stress will lead to an MS relapse.|$|E

5|$|The convoy {{carrying}} the battalion put into Fremantle in mid-February, where {{the small number}} of Western Australian personnel disembarked to begin their home leave. The rest of the battalion continued on to Port Melbourne, before moving to Adelaide by rail. In late March, after the South Australian personnel had completed their leave, the battalion was re-constituted. At that time, a series of parades were held in every Australian capital city to welcome home the 9th Division; the 2/48th marched through Adelaide. After this, the 2/48th were transported to the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, where they established a camp on the Barron River, near Kairi. In April 1943, the battalion was re-organised and re-trained for jungle operations in the South-West Pacific theatre in order to prepare it for the conditions in New Guinea. Undertaking training on the Tablelands, the battalion was converted to the tropical establishment. Warfare in the Pacific posed unique problems and differed greatly to that which the 2/48th had experienced in North Africa. In the jungles of New Guinea logistics and transport were significant challenges and in order to meet them, the battalion's size was reduced by over 100 men, to around 800, as its anti-aircraft and Bren carrier platoons were disbanded, while each of the battalion's four rifle companies lost most of their organic motor transport; the mobility issue would be solved by marching on foot as vehicles were relatively useless in dense jungle, while supplies would <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> using native carriers as well as by air. In July 1943, the battalion moved to Cairns where they undertook amphibious training with the American 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment around Trinity Beach as part of their final preparations before being committed to the fighting in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} R. A. Markus {{suggests that}} the reason for the conflicting advice is that the letter to Æthelberht was written first, and sent off with the returning missionaries. Markus argues that the pope, after thinking further about the circumstances of the mission in Britain, then sent a follow-up letter, the Epistolae ad Mellitum, to Mellitus, then en route to Canterbury, which contained new instructions. Markus sees this as a turning point in missionary history, in that forcible conversion gave way to persuasion. This traditional view that the Epistola represents a contradiction of the letter to Æthelberht has been challenged by George Demacopoulos who argues that the letter to Æthelberht was mainly meant to encourage the king in spiritual matters, while the Epistola was sent to deal with purely practical matters, and thus the two do not contradict each other. Flora Spiegel, a writer on Anglo-Saxon literature, {{suggests that the}} theme of comparing the Anglo-Saxons to the Israelites was part of a conversion strategy involving gradual steps, including an explicitly proto-Jewish one between paganism and Christianity. Spiegel sees this as an extension of Gregory's view of Judaism as halfway between Christianity and paganism. Thus, Gregory felt that first the Anglo-Saxons must <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> to the equivalent of Jewish practices, then after that stage was reached they could be brought completely up to Christian practices.|$|E
