5000|$|... 1b. Balconies with {{curtains}} or one-way glass: more strict congregations {{will add}} a curtain to the <b>balcony</b> so that <b>men</b> cannot see even women's faces.|$|R
5000|$|Time {{passes and}} Athena {{is back on}} his Hong Kong inside her apartment. She hears a loud fall and goes in {{investigate}} to find a band in white coveralls and the same boots at Angel fallen on the <b>balcony.</b> The <b>man</b> in coveralls looks the same as Angel, but introduces himself as Angelo, the restaurant owner downstairs from her apartment.|$|R
60|$|The colonel had {{appeared}} on the <b>balcony,</b> a smallish <b>man,</b> very yellow in the face, with grizzled black hair and very shabby legs. They all seemed so sordidly, hopelessly shabby.|$|R
6000|$|Jefferson {{turned and}} looked over the <b>balcony.</b> A young <b>man</b> who wore spotless white flannel and a red silk belt crossed the flags. He stopped {{abruptly}} when Jefferson shouted: [...] "Hello!" ...|$|R
5|$|The {{woman is}} perched against an armoire, the man {{approaches}} and covers her naked {{body with the}} yellow bathrobe, and the two move towards the window. After they step out on the <b>balcony,</b> the <b>man</b> draws a toothpick {{from his pocket and}} hands it to her with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside.|$|R
5000|$|Plate: In this ad, painted {{figures on}} a {{decorative}} plate — {{a woman on}} a <b>balcony</b> and a <b>man</b> with a guitar in the garden below — talk about GEICO, and then the man plays music while the woman goes back inside.|$|R
40|$|Cartoon portrays Abraham Lincoln as {{a circus}} {{performer}} doing some ceiling walking. Below {{him is a}} crowd looking worried, whilst in the <b>balcony</b> are <b>men</b> in business suits looking unhappy. While hanging upside down, Lincoln barely hangs on, by one foot, {{to the issue of}} Emancipation. He could grab the other rings, but they represent "utter ruin," and other problems from his presidency. The term "olmar" comes from the name of an actual circus performer, James Chadwick, who would perform ceiling walking 90 feet in the air...|$|R
40|$|Outdoor {{photograph}} of an inner courtyard with a fountain, surrounded by two-storied buildings. Four children {{are standing in}} the yard; a child is leaned on the wooden parapet of a <b>balcony,</b> and two <b>men</b> {{are sitting on the}} oriel. Hand-written year and inscriptions in Bulgarian and French: "La cour de Tchoucour-Han / a Tat. Bazardjik. Département de Tat. Bazardjik. ...|$|R
5000|$|In a later scene, {{the quartet}} discovers from the <b>balcony</b> a <b>man</b> lying {{at the bottom}} of the street, and seems to the victim of a car accident. Jambo wants to help, Melanie denies to avoid {{problems}} with the police, as they are foreigners in the United States; Gudrun and Jambo come from Germany, Jambo is illegal in the United States, and three of them are also colored people, as Melanie sets them apart after Jambo brought the supposedly dead in Melanie's apartment. Now in panic, they think about how 'to rid of the dead'. Before they can implement that idea, they notice that the dead man is undoubtedly Johnny Depp ...|$|R
6000|$|Philadelphia.--An old place, full of Dutch women, in [...] "bellus top" [...] bonnets, selling vegetables, in long, open markets. Every {{one seems}} to be {{scrubbing}} their white steps. All the houses look like tidy jails, with their outside shutters. Several have crape on the door-handles, and many have flags flying from roof or <b>balcony.</b> Few <b>men</b> appear, and the women seem to do the business, which, perhaps, accounts for its being so well done. Pass fine buildings, but don't know what they are. Would like to stop and see my native city; for, having left it {{at the tender age of}} two, my recollections are not vivid.|$|R
60|$|For a space Graham stood motionless. Then {{he became}} vividly aware {{that all this}} {{concerned}} him. He was pleased at his wonderful popularity, he bowed, and, seeking a gesture of longer range, waved his arm. He was astonished at the violence of uproar that this provoked. The tumult about the descending stairway rose to furious violence. He became aware of crowded <b>balconies,</b> of <b>men</b> sliding along ropes, of men in trapeze-like seats hurling athwart the space. He heard voices behind him, {{a number of people}} descending the steps through the archway; he suddenly perceived that his guardian Howard was back again and gripping his arm painfully, and shouting inaudibly in his ear.|$|R
2500|$|... 1. [...] Balcony: [...] {{balconies}} with a 3-foot wall {{are themselves}} traditionally considered fitting mechitzas. [...] In this design, women {{sit in the}} <b>balcony</b> and <b>men</b> sit below. [...] This design was common in the 19th and early 20th century, and is common in Europe, including the Shaarei Tikva synagogue in Lisbon (opened in 1904). [...] Examples in the US include the Bnei Israel (Lloyd Street) Synagogue in Baltimore (opened 1845), B'nai Jacob in Ottumwa, Iowa (opened 1915), the Temple Beth Shalom of Cambridge (Tremont Street) synagogue in Cambridge, MA (opened 1925 as Temple Ashkenaz), and the Beth Efraim Bukharian Jewish Synagogue in Forest Hills, NY (70th Ave) - some of these American examples are modeled after specific European synagogues, others are best classified as vernacular architecture.|$|R

60|$|The {{quarters}} of our soldiers at Niagara, are finely and airily situated. Some {{of them are}} large detached houses on the plain above the Falls, which were originally designed for hotels; and in the evening time, when {{the women and children}} were leaning over the <b>balconies</b> watching the <b>men</b> as they played at ball and other games upon the grass before the door, they often presented a little picture of cheerfulness and animation which made it quite a pleasure to pass that way.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} {{view of the}} Willmore Hotel {{as shown}} from the ocean, Long Beach, ca. 1887. The four-story Victorian complex features a clapboard veneer and three wraparound balconies. Its roof is multileveled and features a number of spires. People can be seen along the center staircase to the entrance and along the <b>balconies,</b> while a <b>man</b> and woman sit under umbrellas having {{what appears to be}} a picnic. More individuals play near a bench to the left. The hotel, built in 1887, was destroyed in a fire a year later in 1888...|$|R
50|$|Parco Lago Allocca is a gated {{neighborhood}} {{community of}} two to three story villas with <b>balconies</b> surrounding a <b>man</b> made lake with ducks and geese. When the neighborhood was first built, the gates and metal fences surrounding {{two sides of the}} lake were painted red as were the shutters on the windows of the houses and their balcony railings. American military families stationed at the NATO and US Navy base in the area lived in the neighborhood for many years; however, in more recent years, the demographics of the community has changed.|$|R
60|$|Alvina {{rose and}} went round {{to the little}} <b>balcony.</b> Two <b>men</b> stood below, amid the {{crumbling}} of finely falling snow. One, the elder, had a bagpipe whose bag was patched with shirting: the younger was dressed in greenish clothes, he had his face lifted, and was yelling the verses of the unintelligible Christmas ballad: short, rapid verses, followed by a brilliant flourish on a short wooden pipe he held ready in his hand. Alvina felt {{he was going to}} be out of breath. But no, rapid and high came the next verse, verse after verse, with the wild scream on the little new pipe in between, over the roar of the bagpipe. And the crumbs of snow were like a speckled veil, faintly drifting the atmosphere and powdering the littered threshold where they stood--a threshold littered with faggots, leaves, straw, fowls and geese and ass droppings, and rag thrown out from the house, and pieces of paper.|$|R
60|$|We {{turned the}} corner of a street and reached the edge of the great square. It was filled with a vast {{concourse}} of people. At the very moment in which we reached it a great burst of cheering rose from the crowd. We could see {{over the heads of the}} people that a man had appeared on the balcony of the Government Building, holding a paper in his hand. His appearance was evidently a signal for the outburst of cheers, accompanied by the waving of handkerchiefs. The man raised his hand in a gesture of authority. German training is deep. Silence fell instantly upon the assembled populace. We had time in the momentary pause to examine, as closely as the distance permitted, the figure upon the <b>balcony.</b> The <b>man</b> was dressed in the blue overall suit of a workingman. He was bare-headed. His features, so far as we could tell, were those of a man well up in years, but his frame was rugged and powerful. Then he began to speak.|$|R
60|$|Red Martin stood {{upon the}} <b>balcony</b> {{gripping}} the <b>man</b> Ramiro. Beneath him the broad street {{was packed with}} people, hundreds and thousands of them, a dense mass seething in the shadows, save here and again where a torch or a lantern flared showing their white faces, for the moon, which shone upon Martin and his captive, scarcely reached those down below. As gaunt, haggard, and long-haired, he stepped upon the balcony, they saw him and his burden, and there went up such a yell as shook the very roofs of Leyden. Martin held up his hand, and there was silence, deep silence, through which the breath of all that multitude rose in sighs, like the sighing of a little wind.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis best {{to leave}} them alone," [...] he said as they {{looked down into the}} street, where the English and their Dutch allies, many of whom had now landed, were {{wandering}} about examining the public buildings and churches, while the inhabitants looked with timid curiosity from their windows and <b>balconies</b> at the <b>men</b> who had, as if by magic, suddenly become their masters. [...] "I can see that the old gentleman is terribly cut up. Of course, nothing has been said between us yet, for it was not until we heard the sound of firing in the streets that anyone thought there was the smallest risk of your capturing the city. Nevertheless, he must be sure that I shall take this opportunity of returning home.|$|R
5000|$|In Prepare to Meteor Maker, Sir Richard Chutney announces to {{the secret}} council that planet earth will soon collide with a meteor. All {{the members of the}} council decide to pretend they are having a charity high-altitude balloon race, while they are {{actually}} escaping armageddon. Meanwhile, Albumen is about to be arrested, because The Sun is threatening to release an article about his treason during the Falklands War. Adonis Cnut takes Hannah and Albumen with him in his balloon, looking forward to having to repopulate the world together with Hannah. When he tries to shoot an albatross, Adonis actually hits Richard Chutney's balloon, and Chutney seems to land on their <b>balcony.</b> The <b>man</b> then turns out to be called Graeme, and Chutney is apparently still on the ground, having lied about the meteor, and is now buying all the world's major companies (including Microsoft) for very reasonable prices. Luckily, while Chutney is busy becoming the owner of the planet, Adonis [...] "drops in unannounced" [...] and manages to depress Chutney so much (by telling him there are no challenges left for him in life) that it drives him to jump out of the window. Adonis buys The Sun and prevents Albumen's arrest.|$|R
25|$|On February 1, 1564 {{he issued}} an edict setting a curfew for 10 p.m. {{in the city}} of Lima. On the {{following}} February 20, at midnight, four figures with their faces completely covered were seen violating the curfew. They entered the street of Trapitos and took up positions outside one of the houses there. At night this street {{was one of the most}} deserted in the city. The block in question was made up of four houses, none of which opened on Trapitos. There were no doors, but there were some balconies overlooking the street. Shortly after the arrival of the masked men, a rope ladder was thrown down from one of these <b>balconies,</b> and a <b>man</b> wrapped in a cape began to descend. Just before he reached the street, the four men lying in wait began to beat him with sandbags.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's true, my dears; and {{the worst}} of it is, I knew the truth all the time. Now, don't have hysterics, but listen and enjoy the joke as I do. At Coblentz, when you sat in the <b>balcony,</b> two young <b>men</b> overheard Amy sigh for adventures, and Helen advise making a romance out of the gloves one of the lads had dropped. They had seen you by day; both admired you, and being idle, gay young fellows, they {{resolved}} to devote their vacation to gratifying your wishes and enjoying themselves. We met at the Fortress; I knew one of them, and liked the other immensely; so when they confided their scheme to me I agreed to help them carry it out, as I had perfect confidence in both, and thought a little adventure or two would do you good." ...|$|R

50|$|In the meantime, Phil (Ty Burrell) and Luke (Nolan Gould) {{arrive at}} Jay's {{to hang out}} with Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Gloria (Sofía Vergara) by the pool. While Gloria enjoys the sun in her swim suit, a drone flies around her spying her and {{recording}} her with its camera. Phil, Luke and Manny try to destroy the drone or drift it away but a series of events leads to a video of Phil exposing his genitals being uploaded on YouTube and going viral. The three of them take it personally and they want to find the source that controls the drone by following it, something that leads to another video being uploaded on YouTube with their failure. After that, they are determined to break the camera by throwing balls at the drone while Jay joins their attempt. Finally, the drone is destroyed by Gloria who shoots it with a gun from the <b>balcony</b> leaving the <b>men</b> believe that {{they are the ones who}} took it down.|$|R
50|$|Baldwin and Cynthia are {{the only}} ones left alive, with Yorga supernaturally mocking Baldwin {{throughout}} the estate. However, Yorga seals their exit routes while his brides slowly close in on the two. They duck into a darken hallway, but when Baldwin turns on the lights, he finds himself confronted by all the brides (including Ellen and Mitzi) with Yorga behind them who calls Cynthia over to his side. Yorga takes her away preparing to transform her into a new bride, while leaving his army of brides to finish off Baldwin. Baldwin somehow escapes the brides and gives pursuit (along the way, grabbing an iron battle-axe from a wall), chasing the two up to the <b>balcony.</b> The two <b>men</b> fight, with Yorga gaining the advantage. Just as he's about to kill Baldwin via choking. Cynthia's memories of the brides killing her family resurfaces causing her to realize Yorga was responsible for their deaths. She strikes Yorga in the chest with Baldwin's battle-axe. With Yorga stunned by the action, Baldwin uses the moment to throw Yorga off the balcony, killing him.|$|R
