40|$|In this paper, two level discriminative {{learning}} for audio events recognition in sport broadcasts archive is described. The audio events recognition {{is based on}} the idea that audio events are composed of <b>basic</b> <b>units.</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>units</b> are some elementary events. Audio events used for semantic interpretation (mid-level concepts) are presented as a combination of the <b>basic</b> <b>units.</b> Models for the <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> are GMM models. Each 5 frames of audio data are recognized using models of the <b>basic</b> <b>units.</b> Each mid-level concept is described by the distribution of the <b>basic</b> <b>units.</b> The distribution of the <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> in each class of segment corresponding to mid-level concepts is considered as a macro model of this class. For events recognition the tree based framework is used. In each level of the tree two macro models are compared. The two level discriminative {{learning for}} macro models is applied. First discriminative training level is on the level of <b>basic</b> <b>units,</b> second is on the level of macro models. The suggested approach is compared with maximum likelihood decision and SVM with polynomial kernel. The results of experiments indicate significant improvement in comparison with the conventional approaches in the task of acoustically closely audio events recognition...|$|R

30|$|It can be assumed, {{without loss}} of generality, that the GOP {{structure}} is IPPP..., where I is an intra-coded picture and P is a forward-predicted picture. The adaptive rate control scheme in the H. 264 /AVC {{is composed of}} two layers: the GOP layer rate control and the frame layer rate control. An additional <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> layer rate control is added if {{the size of the}} <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> is smaller than a frame. It was noted in [4] that using a bigger <b>basic</b> <b>unit,</b> a higher PSNR can be achieved with higher bit fluctuations, and using a smaller <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> there will be smaller bit fluctuations with a slight loss in PSNR. Since we want to maximize PSNR for this study, the <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> is selected as a frame so {{there is no need for}} an additional <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> layer rate control. In addition, only the frame layer rate control is modified; the operation of the GOP layer rate control remains the same.|$|R

40|$|Four {{types of}} boron {{nanotubes}} BNTs {{in the form}} of double-ring <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> are theoretically predicted. The structure, stability, and electronic properties of these stable BNTs are investigated by the first-principles calculations. The BNT formed by the <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> with one hole every six atoms on each ring is found to be more stable than those with other three types of <b>basic</b> <b>units.</b> By increasing diameter for boron ring, the stability is enhanced. The density of state demonstrates that BNTs formed by these <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> are metallic.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to identify what causes variation of optimum plot size estimate, acquired from different methods, and the consequences in experimental precision and the treatment total area of corn experiments.

The two algebraic forms presented by Thomas and maximum modified curve method by Meier & Lessman resulted in underestimation of optimum plot size of corn trials, since both methods estimated higher number of replications to keep the same precision and experimental area. Average yield of one <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> did not change optimum plot size. Variance estimations among <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> and the heterogeneity index changed optimum plot size.
