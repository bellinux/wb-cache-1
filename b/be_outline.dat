40|$|The {{presence}} of abandoned and unstable underground cavities can {{give rise to}} a potential risk of surface collapse, particularly alarming when the {{presence of}} buildings is attested on the surface. The INERIS (Institut National de l'Environnement Industriel et des Risques, France) has carried out many studies, in recent years, investigating the effectiveness of several methodologies to monitor the evolution of the damaging mechanisms. During 2012 the Brasserie quarry, an old limestone mine (Paris, France) was instrumented with microphones to detect the acoustic waves generated by the collapse of blocks from the roof and the walls of the cavity. A series of tests were carried out to determine the propagation characteristics. Preliminary data processing concerned the event classification and the analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the present paper, after the description of the case study, the preliminary results and the description of the upcoming works and expectation will <b>be</b> <b>outline...</b>|$|E

These problems led Chevron {{to the development of}} a specification and inspection dependent response. Eventually, when this self defense reaction proved to be less effective than required, Chevron Engineering began to think about improving quality by improving the business relationships with our suppliers. An investigation of problems in newly constructed facilities was carried out. This confirmed the extensive financial losses to Chevron Corporation, cause by poor quality in a wide range of process plant hardware. To correct this problem, they set about learning how companies like Xerox and Ford had, over a period of years, made significant improvements in the quality of components and materials they bought to go into their products. And now we have started to apply these proven successful methods. The Chevron approach and the current status of our supplier quality improvement process will <b>be</b> <b>outline...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{study will}} brief the readers about the {{physical}} layer for a infrared communication system for portable devices, it will discuss the infrared physical layer from few perspectives, e. g: power consumption, link distance, radiation pattern etc. Few vital mathematics equations will <b>be</b> <b>outline</b> briefly along the discussion. It then follows by the infrared emitter and detector analysis. Lastly, it will discuss some relevent method to increase the link distance for more effective system. Infrared light, {{commonly referred to as}} “IR”, is a common, easy-to-use, low power and low-cost media to transmit information. Among the few “wireless” communication choices, IR has the significant advantage of compatibility with hundreds of millions of electronic devices with IR ports (i. e., laptop PCs, PDAs). The vast majority of IR-capable devices are compatible with a set of standards established by the Infrared Data Association, or IrDA®. These standards include guidelines for implementing the IR Physical Layer (IrDA Serial Infrared Physical Layer specification), ensuring that IR communication can be established through free space between two dissimilar devices...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} select clones of uniform wood {{properties}} to meet specific end use requirements {{is viewed as}} a key element for increasing profitability of exotic pine plantations in Queensland. A genetic mapping project has been initiated to investigate wood properties assessed in 11 year old F 1 s. This will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the genetic architecture of wood traits and evaluation of the potential for marker-aided selection in the development of improved planting stock. Microsatellite and AFLP markers as well as wood properties will be mapped using a pseudotestcross strategy. This will allow co-segregation analysis between markers and those loci controlling wood traits which are heterozygous in the pure species parents and is most effective where parents are unselected for wood properties. By analysing half and full sib progeny sharing a common parent it is hoped QTL of good hybridising ability can be identified. Plantings over multiple sites will allow investigation of QTL stability across environments. The strategy and recent progress will <b>be</b> <b>outline...</b>|$|E

40|$|LHCb is a {{dedicated}} experiment to study New Physics in the decays of heavy hadrons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The detector includes a high precision tracking system {{consisting of a}} silicon-strip vertex detector (VELO) surrounding the pp interaction region, a large- area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet (TT), and three stations of silicon- strip detectors (IT) and straw drift tubes placed downstream (OT). The operational transition of the silicon detectors VELO, TT and IT from LHC Run 1 to Run 2 and first Run 2 experiences will be presented. During the long shutdown of the LHC the silicon detectors have been maintained in a safe state and operated regularly to validate changes in the control infrastructure, new operational procedures, updates to the alarm systems and monitoring software. In addition, {{there have been some}} infrastructure related challenges due to maintenance performed {{in the vicinity of the}} silicon detectors that will be discussed. The LHCb silicon detectors are well prepared for LHC Run 2 and have already recorded tracks from injection line tests and low energy collisions.

40|$|Semi-non-destructive Small Punch (SP) tests, {{at present}} {{frequently}} employed for mechanical characterization of structural metals in plant components [1], are here employed also for assessment of stresses. The innovative procedure proposed herein {{belongs to the}} structural inverse analysis methodology (see e. g. [2]) and can <b>be</b> <b>outline</b> d as follows. The sample removal from an in-service component for SP tests is exploited as external action altering the residual stress state possibly present in the location considered. Full-field measurements by Digital Image Correlation of consequent displacements in the surrounding surface are input for inverse analysis. The inverse analysis leading to deterministic estimation of the plane stress tensor is based on: computer simulations by finite element modelling of the sample removal test, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) [3] for model reduction apt to simplify the computational operations, discrepancy function minimization with employment of the elasticity parameters provided by the subsequent SP test. Such minimization is performed by a Trust Region Algorithm made fast and economical through preliminary POD. The purpose and practical advantage of the proposed method consist of no more need of Hole Drilling or other tests [4], additional to SP tests with further “damage”, for residual stress estimation and mechanical characterization of the material: namely, the back-analysis procedure proposed herein implies exploitation of present standardized SP test for estimations of both stresses and elastic-plastic properties of materials...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{helicopters}} play {{a pivotal}} role {{in a wide variety of}} activities from important military missions to emergency medical transport, indeed it is a common experience that a helicopter may often be seen overhead. Originally, aircraft noise was not much of an issue because of the overarching requirement of improving vehicle performance in critical operational conditions. By the 1960 s, noise and vibration control of helicopters has become more and more important and the next level technical challenge is to include new design parameters such as vibro-acoustic comfort and environmental impact in the design process of a modern rotorcraft. From one side, government regulations are imposed to contain noise pollution while on the other hand customers do not accept any longer a noisy product. On top of all this, the competitive pressure to bring products faster to market has made that NVH (Noise Vibration and Harshness) designers are looking for tools giving them an insight on where the noise is coming from. In this scenario, we want to present a modus operandi to tackle this issue by several advanced experimental methodologies, since the requirement of a quieter helicopter needs a systematic study of its NVH behavior. Experimental tests are carried and results are reported concerning two different helicopters: an EUROCOPTER EC- 135 and an Agusta Westland W- 109 helicopter. The proposed methodologies count several experimental NVH analyses and processing, which will <b>be</b> <b>outline</b> hereafter. It is interesting to note that although the presented methodologies concern particular helicopters, they have a general meaning, since they can be applied in a large variety of fields, as in aircraft fuselage, car or track interiors, etc. This work has to be intended as an analytical review of the authors’ research...|$|E

40|$|Geometry is a {{fundamental}} part of mathematical learning. Since ancient time the study of geometry was considered {{as one of the}} most important subjects in school. In the arcade of the famous school of Athens, where Plato taught, it was written that entry was not permitted to people who did not know geometry. In the Renaissance period, geometry was part of the 'quadrivium', which was considered a needed work preparatory for a serious study of philosophy. Nevertheless, despite geometry is one of the main areas of mathematical learning, the cognitive processes underlying geometry-related academic achievement have not been studied in detail. The present dissertation has three important aims. First, to investigate the relationship between various aspects of geometry and visuospatial working memory (VSWM). Second, to investigate whether the children with nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD) symptoms present difficulties in various aspects of geometry. Third, to investigate the relationship between various aspect of geometry, working memory (WM) and intelligence (g). In the second chapter, a general overview of the relationship between geometry, WM and g is provided. Since geometry concerns the study of the space, it requires a particular involvement of spatial abilities. Thus, WM, and in particular VSWM should be crucially involved. In addition, solving geometrical problems requires to reason and to find out a solution among various alternatives. Thus, g should be crucially involved in solving geometrical problems. In the third chapter, the relationship between academic achievement in geometry, intuitive geometry (i. e., a part of geometry which seems to be independent from the culture), and VSWM will be examined. Two studies will be presented. In the first study, the involvement of VSWM in intuitive geometry and in school performance in geometry at secondary school was tested. A total of 166 pupils were administered: (1) six VSWM tasks, comprising simple storage and complex span tasks; (2) the intuitive geometry task devised by Dehaene, Izard, Pica, and Spelke (2006), which distinguishes between core, presumably independent form the culture, and culturally-mediated principles of geometry; and (3) a task measuring academic achievement in geometry. In the second study, VSWM and intuitive geometry were examined in two groups aged 11  13; one with children displaying symptoms of NLD, and the other, a control group without learning disabilities. The two groups were matched for general verbal abilities, age, gender, and socioeconomic level. The children were presented with simple storage and complex-span tasks involving VSWM and with the intuitive geometry task devised by Dehaene and colleagues (Dehaene et al., 2006). In the fourth chapter, we report a study on the relationship between geometry, WM, and intelligence aimed to find out the model of WM which provided the best fit to the data and to examine the strength of the relations between WM and intelligence (part I) and the relationship between geometry (intuitive geometry and geometrical achievement), WM and g testing several models (part II). In the last chapter a general overview of the important theoretical and applied implications of the three studies will be discussed.
