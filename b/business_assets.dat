Income of a corporation's shareholders usually includes distributions of profits from the corporation. Deductions typically include all income producing or business expenses including an allowance for recovery of costs of <b>business</b> <b>assets.</b> Many jurisdictions allow notional deductions for individuals, and may allow deduction of some personal expenses. Most jurisdictions either do not tax income earned outside the jurisdiction or allow a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions on such income.

25|$|Kings Island was nationally {{promoted}} in two well-known sitcoms on ABC. Each filmed an episode on location at the park: The Partridge Family in 1972 and The Brady Bunch in 1973. The Brady Bunch {{was produced by}} Paramount Television, a large Taft Broadcasting shareholder. In later years, Kings Island changed ownership several times. Taft sold its theme park division in 1984 for $167.5 million to Kings Entertainment Company (KECO), a company formed by senior executives and general managers of Taft Attractions Group. Three parks – Kings Island, Kings Dominion and Carowinds – {{were involved in the}} sale. Taft invested in KECO to retain one-third interest.

25|$|Asset {{poverty is}} an {{economic}} and social condition that is more persistent and prevalent than income poverty. It {{can be defined as}} a household's inability to access wealth resources that are enough to provide for basic needs for a period of three months. Basic needs refer to the minimum standards for consumption and acceptable needs.Wealth resources consist of home ownership, other real estate (second home, rented properties, etc.), net value of farm and <b>business</b> <b>assets,</b> stocks, checking and savings accounts, and other savings (money in savings bonds, life insurance policy cash values, etc.).Wealth is measured in three forms: net worth, net worth minus home equity, and liquid assets. Net worth consists of all the aspects mentioned above. Net worth minus home equity is the same except it does not include home ownership in asset calculations. Liquid assets are resources that are readily available such as cash, checking and savings accounts, stocks, and other sources of savings. There are two types of assets: tangible and intangible. Tangible assets most closely resemble liquid assets in that they include stocks, bonds, property, natural resources, and hard assets not in the form of real estate. Intangible assets are simply the access to credit, social capital, cultural capital, political capital, and human capital.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Cost and {{competitive}} pressures are forcing business organizations to reuse assets from repositories, rather than develop them from scratch. But {{this has been}} hampered by some issues {{that have not been}} addressed so far. First, {{there is a lack of}} a mechanism for the representation of <b>business</b> process <b>assets</b> as variants and versions in repositories. Second, there is no formal means to compare between different variants and versions of an asset and determine which is the best to select for reuse. Third, there is a lack of a technique to determine the extent to which a <b>business</b> process <b>asset</b> could be customized for reuse. In this paper, we address the above research issues by presenting an integrated approach for modeling, analyzing, and searching <b>business</b> process <b>assets</b> in a repository for enhancing reuse. We demonstrate our approach on a large repository of <b>business</b> process <b>assets</b> in the insurance domain...|$|R
