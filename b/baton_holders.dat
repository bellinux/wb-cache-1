50|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>baton</b> <b>holders</b> for {{officers}} who have fixed or collapsible batons. For fixed straight and side-handle batons, they use a ring which keeps the baton in place, but can slide out when the officer is running or engaging in an altercation with an offender, and a fixed baton usually has to be removed before the officer can sit in their patrol vehicle.|$|E

When an officer needs to draw the device from a cross-draw baton holster, they would be required to reach across their front to the other side of the belt, where the baton is, undo a thumbsnap (these <b>baton</b> <b>holders</b> have open tops, but are considered secure) and pull the baton out of the pouch. These holders also allow the baton to be stored while extended to allow the officer to arrest a suspect without the officer having to drop their baton or collapse it, which could take time and allowing the suspect to stage a counterattack or escape.|$|E

Specifi cally, I analyze the complex nature of trust-control relationships in Orpheus orchestra, the world’s largest contemporary conductorless orchestra. I discuss how it rehearses and performs without a <b>baton</b> <b>holder</b> and benefi ts from the creativity of all musicians. This study supports the duality perspective of trust-control relationships. While competence trust and goodwill trust enable musicians to participate in organizational decision-making and be creative, it is behavioral, input, output and social control strategies that facilitate the development of trust and help ensure the orchestra’s long-term success. Trust-control duality allows Orpheus to achieve “optimal distinctiveness, ” which aligns creativity and artistic freedoms {{with the goals of}} economic stability...|$|R
