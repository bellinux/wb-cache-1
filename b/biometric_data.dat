40|$|Abstract: Biometric cryptosystems allow {{cryptographic}} {{privacy protection}} for <b>biometric</b> reference <b>data</b> without storing a secret key. However, their se-curity is inherently {{limited by the}} discriminative information content of the <b>biometric</b> feature <b>data.</b> Given the currently exploitable entropy of biomet-ric features, {{one of the most}} promising approaches to achieve high privacy levels is to combine several biometric modalities or several instances of the same biometric modality. In this contribution, we theoretically analyze multi-biometric fusion strategies for biometric cryptosystems with respect to their impact on security and recognition accuracy. We also introduce hash level as a new fusion level. Furthermore, we give a more detailed analysis for the most prominent schemes, the Fuzzy Commitment Scheme and the Fuzzy Vault. ...|$|R

25|$|However, {{work with}} cadavers {{presented}} {{almost as many}} problems as it resolved. Not only were there the moral and ethical issues related to working with the dead, {{but there were also}} research concerns. The majority of cadavers available were older white adults who had died non-violent deaths; they did not represent a demographic cross-section of accident victims. Deceased accident victims could not be employed because any data that might be collected from such experimental subjects would be compromised by the cadaver's previous injuries. Since no two cadavers are the same, and since any specific part of a cadaver could only be used once, it was extremely difficult to achieve reliable comparison data. In addition, child cadavers were not only difficult to obtain, but both legal and public opinion made them effectively unusable. Moreover, as crash testing became more routine, suitable cadavers became increasingly scarce. As a result, <b>biometric</b> <b>data</b> were limited in extent and skewed toward the older males.|$|E

The current PIN (Personal Identification Number) authentication in mobile device is weak and there is a demand of strong authentication. Biometrics adds an additional authentication and it provides most significant improvement in mobile security.

2500|$|The {{operating}} {{system must be}} capable of distinguishing between requests which {{should be allowed to}} be processed, and others which should not be processed. While some systems may simply distinguish between [...] "privileged" [...] and [...] "non-privileged", systems commonly have a form of requester identity, such as a user name. To establish identity there may be a process of authentication. Often a username must be quoted, and each username may have a password. Other methods of authentication, such as magnetic cards or <b>biometric</b> <b>data,</b> might be used instead. In some cases, especially connections from the network, resources may be accessed with no authentication at all (such as reading files over a network share). Also covered by the concept of requester identity is authorization; the particular services and resources accessible by the requester once logged into a system are tied to either the requester's user account or to the variously configured groups of users to which the requester belongs.|$|E

After tests, she tells him the cause of his accelerated aging, and that the FOXDIE virus inside him will mutate within six months, spreading a deadly version of FOXDIE to the population. PMC members kidnap Naomi, and after retrieving her, Snake and Naomi make their escape out of the country with the help of Drebin and Raiden. Snake finds an Eastern Europe resistance group that have both the equipment to heal Raiden, after he was injured in a fight with Vamp, and the remains of Big Boss. Once there, EVA, leading the resistance group under the alias [...] "Big Mama", reveals that she is the surrogate mother to Snake and Liquid Snake through the [...] "Les Enfants Terribles" [...] cloning project. Liquid's armed forces attack Snake, Big Mama, and the decoy vehicles pretending to transport Big Boss' remains. Snake helps Big Mama escape to the riverside, where Big Boss' real remains are hidden in a coffin, but Liquid reveals that he no longer needs Big Boss' body, and that he has already infiltrated the system using his own system core to act as a Trojan. U.S. military forces arrive, but he disables their firearms via his Trojan core. Vamp throws Big Boss' body into flames caused by an explosion, leaving the side of Snake's face burned after he saves Big Mama from jumping in after it. Liquid escapes with Naomi as collateral, but Otacon's robot sneaks onto Liquid's boat after them. Big Mama later dies from her injuries.|$|E
