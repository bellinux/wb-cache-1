30|$|<b>Berseem</b> (Trifolium alexandrinum) {{is one of}} {{the main}} fodder crops of Punjab, India. But due to the heavy metal {{contamination}} of agricultural soils by anthropogenic activities, there is rise in metal bioaccumulation in crops like <b>Berseem.</b> In addition to human influence, heavy metal contents in soil are highly dependent on soil characteristics also. Therefore a study was conducted in areas having intensive agricultural practices to analyze physico-chemical characteristics of soils under <b>Berseem</b> cultivation and heavy metal bioaccumulation in <b>Berseem.</b> The studied soils were alkaline, sandy in texture and low in soil organic matter. Among the studied heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Cd, Co and Pb) in soil and <b>Berseem,</b> Cr content in <b>Berseem</b> was found to be above maximum permissible limits. Soil to <b>Berseem</b> metal bioaccmulation factor (BAF) was above 1 for Cr, Cu, Cd and Co in many samples and highest BAF was found for Co (4.625).

Four weeks after a killing frost (- 2 o C), <b>berseem</b> clover was harvested from the same locations previously sampled. To evaluate maturity, 336 DacronÒ bags containing all maturities of either alfalfa or <b>berseem</b> clover were placed into the rumen of two fistulated steers fed alfalfa-grass hay. Frost killing effects of <b>berseem</b> clover were compared with maturecut <b>berseem</b> clover by placing DacronÒ bags into the rumen of one fistulated steer fed alfalfa hay. Bags were incubated for periods of 0 to 48 hours. With increasing maturity, the proportion of non-degradable protein (NDP) and the rate of crude protein (CP) degradation increased in both forages. While the rate of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradation and potentially degradable protein proportion (PDP) increased with increasing maturity in alfalfa, the rate of NDF degradation and PDP proportion decreased and proportion of water soluble protein (WSP) increased in <b>berseem</b> clover. The proportion of protein escaping rumen degradation (PEP) was greater in <b>berseem</b> clover than alfalfa, but was not affected by maturity.

40|$|Several studies, {{performed}} {{mainly in}} pots, {{have shown that}} arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis can mitigate {{the negative effects of}} water stress on plant growth. No information is available about the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis on <b>berseem</b> clover growth and nitrogen (N) fixation under conditions of water shortage. A field experiment was conducted in a hilly area of inner Sicily, Italy, to determine whether symbiosis with AM fungi can mitigate the detrimental effects of drought stress (which in the Mediterranean often occurs during the late period of the growing season) on forage yield and symbiotic N 2 fixation of <b>berseem</b> clover. Soil was either left under water stress (i. e., rain-fed conditions) or the crop was well-watered. Mycorrhization treatments consisted of inoculation of <b>berseem</b> clover seeds with arbuscular mycorrhizal spores or suppression of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by means of fungicide treatments. Nitrogen biological fixation was assessed using the 15 N-isotope dilution technique. Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis was able to mitigate the negative effect of water stress on <b>berseem</b> clover grown in a typical semiarid Mediterranean environment. In fact, under water stress conditions, arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis resulted in increases in total biomass, N content, and N fixation, whereas no effect of crop mycorrhization was observed in the well-watered treatment...|$|E
40|$|In Mediterranean countries, {{forage grasses}} and legumes are {{commonly}} grown in mixture {{because of their}} ability to increase herbage yield and quality compared with monocrop systems. However, the benefits of intercropping over a monocrop system are not always realized because the efficiency of a grass–legume mixture is strongly affected by agronomic factors. The present study evaluated productivity, N 2 fixation, N transfer, and N recovery of <b>berseem</b> clover (Trifolium alexandrinum) grown in pure stand and in mixture with annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) under high or low defoliation frequencies and varying plant arrangements (sowing in the same row or in alternating rows). On average, the berseem–ryegrass mixtures resulted in a greater yield and N yield than the monocrops. When mixed together, ryegrass was more efficient than <b>berseem</b> at absorbing soil N, increasing the reliance of <b>berseem</b> on N 2 fixation. Both defoliation management and plant arrangement affected forage yield {{and the quality of the}} mixture, modifying the proportion of the two components, the N content of the forage, and the symbiotic N 2 fixation of the legume. Reducing the proximity between plants of the two species may benefit the weaker component of the mixture. No apparent transfer of fixed N from <b>berseem</b> to ryegrass was detected...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to determine yield characters of 9 annual forage legumes species (Common vetch, hairy vetch, hungarian vetch, narbon vetch, grass pea, <b>berseem</b> clover, red clover, gelemen clover and pea) as winter catch crop between 2003 - 2004 and 2004 - 2005 in the Black Sea Coastal Regions, Turkey. The experiment was established in randomized block design with three replications. As a result, the highest dry matter and crude protein yield was obtained from <b>berseem</b> clover and common vetch (6. 31, 5. 80,. 15 and 1. 12 t ha - 1, respectively) and the lowest dry matter and crude protein yield was obtained from narbon vetch and grass pea (3. 26,. 93, 0. 55 and 0. 52 t ha - 1, respectively). <b>Berseem</b> clover and common vetch can be recommended in similar ecologies because of their high dry matter and crude protein yields...|$|E
40|$|Two field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} during 1978 - 79 and 1979 - 80 seasons to study the effect of interseeding <b>berseem</b> with ryegrass and nitrogen fertilizer on the fresh yield and nitrogen content of yield and rhizosphere microorganisms. The soil is clayey in texture, non saline, and alkaline in reaction (pH 7. 6). Each experiment included twenty treatments, which were the combinations between five treatments of interseeding <b>berseem</b> (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) with ryegrass (Lolium multiforum L.) in addition to four rates of nitrogen fertilizer. The third mixture (75 % <b>berseem</b> + 25 % ryegrass) produced the highest accumulated nitrogen content and green forage yield and also the highest total bacterial counts, Azotobacter, N-fixing clostredia and nitrifier counts, irrespective of fertilizer application. Total green forage yield, {{as well as its}} nitrogen content and different groups of soil microorganisms studied, increased significantly as nitrogen fertilizer increased...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} some forage feeds of ruminants {{in terms}} of their carbohydrate (CHO) and protein fractions using Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS). Materials and Methods: Eleven ruminant feeds (six green fodders - maize, oat, sorghum, bajra, cowpea, <b>berseem</b> and five range herbages - para grass, guinea grass, hedge lucerne, setaria grass and hybrid napier) were selected for this study. Each feed was chemically analyzed for proximate principles (dry matter, crude protein [CP], ether extract, organic matter and ash), fiber fractions (neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, acid detergent lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose), primary CHO fractions (CHO, non-structural CHO, structural CHO and starch) and primary protein fractions (neutral detergent insoluble CP, acid detergent insoluble CP, non-protein nitrogen and soluble protein). The results were fitted to the equations of CNCPS to arrive at various CHO (CA - fast degrading, CB 1 - intermediate degrading, CB 2 - slow degrading and CC - nondegrading or unavailable) and protein (PA - instantaneously degrading, PB 1 - fast degrading, PB 2 - intermediate degrading, PB 3 - slow degrading and PC - non-degrading or unavailable) fractions of test feeds. Results: Among green fodders, cowpea and <b>berseem</b> had higher CA content while except hedge lucerne all range herbages had lower CA values. CB 1 content of all feeds was low but similar. All feeds except cowpea, <b>berseem,</b> and hedge lucerne contained higher CB 2 values. Oat among green fodders and hybrid napier among range herbages had lower CC fraction. Feeds such as bajra, cowpea, <b>berseem</b> and the setaria grass contained lower PA fraction. All green fodders had higher PB 1 content except maize and cowpea while all range herbages had lower PB 1 values except hedge lucerne. Para grass and hybrid napier contained exceptionally low PB 2 fraction among all feeds. Low PC contents were reported in oat and <b>berseem</b> fodders. Conclusion: Based on our findings, it was concluded that feeds with similar CP and CHO content varied significantly with respect to their CHO and protein fractions. Due to lower CC fraction, oat and hybrid napier were superior feeds {{in terms of}} CHO supply to ruminants. Similarly, among all feeds oat and <b>berseem</b> had a lower PC fraction, thus were considered good sources of protein for ruminants...|$|E
40|$|<b>Berseem</b> clover and oats were {{incorporated}} into a corn-oat/berseem clover rotation in 1994 - 1996. Two cuttings of oat-berseem clover hay were harvested during the summer before forage was stockpiled for winter grazing. In 1995, brown midrib sorghum x sudangrass hybrid was seeded into a field adjacent to a corn field. This was repeated in 1996 with a standard sorghum x sudangrass hybrid. After corn harvest in 1994 – 1996, Charolais x Angus x Simmental cows and heifers in midgestation were allotted to corn crop residue, corn crop residue-berseem clover, and corn crop residue-sorghum x sudangrass fields at 2. 5 acres/cow, or to a drylot. <b>Berseem</b> clover had greater concentration of digestible organic matter and crude protein than corn crop residues. Corn crop residue digestible organic matter concentration was lower than <b>berseem</b> clover and the brown midrib sorghum x sudangrass, but was {{higher than that of}} the standard sorghum x sudangrass hybrid in 1996. Cows grazing corn crop residues without complementary forages required an average of 2, 374 less lb. hay per cow than cows maintained in a drylot in 1994 - 1996. In 1994 and 1996, simultaneous grazing of <b>berseem</b> clover with corn crop residues did not reduce hay feeding more than feeding corn crop residues alone, yet did significantly reduce the amount of hay needed in 1995 to maintain cows by 358 and 376 lb. hay per cow compared with grazing corn crop residues without complementary forage...|$|E

The second, third, and fourth experimental rations were formulated by replacing 50 % of <b>Berseem</b> hay (BH) by alternative sources of roughage such as MBH, SBVH, and PVH, for R 2, R 3, and R 4, respectively. Rations were offered ad libitum.|$|E
