5|$|During the 19th Dynasty, prince Khaemwaset, {{a son of}} Ramesses II, {{undertook}} restoration works throughout Egypt on pyramids and temples {{which had}} fallen into ruin. Inscriptions on the stone cladding of the pyramid of Sahure show that it was restored at this time. This is possibly <b>because,</b> <b>from</b> the mid 18th Dynasty onwards, the mortuary temple of Sahure served as a sanctuary for the goddess Sekhmet. In {{the second part of}} the 18th Dynasty and during the 19th Dynasty numerous visitors left inscriptions, stelae and statues in the temple. Activities seemed to have continued on-site for a long time, as shown by graffiti dating from the 26th Dynasty (664525 BC) until the Ptolemaic period (33230 BC).|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice <b>because</b> <b>from</b> there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
25|$|Sharon’s {{withdrawal}} did not {{advance the}} peace process <b>because,</b> <b>from</b> the Palestinian perspective, the unilateral pullout took place without negotiation on wider issues affecting both sides. NPR addressed this issue in a Q about Israel’s pullout from Gaza.|$|E

25|$|In the 1973/74 season Ellerslie won the ACA Major Club Championship for clubs with 4 or more {{teams in}} their ranks {{which was a}} great feather in its cap <b>because</b> <b>from</b> then on {{everyone}} sat up and respected Ellerslie as a club of the future.|$|E
25|$|Lidford {{was chosen}} as the {{terminus}} <b>because</b> <b>from</b> there a connection with the SDR's Tavistock branch line could give LSWR trains access to Plymouth via Tavistock. However it was only on 17 May 1876 that the connection was made and trains could run through to Plymouth. This was a broad gauge line so, as at Crediton, a third rail was added to create a mixed gauge route.|$|E

25|$|North Melbourne {{is unique}} in its structure, <b>because</b> <b>from</b> 1986 to 2006 the club was privately owned and limited by shares. The club was floated in 1986 through a {{membership}} vote led by then chairman Bob Ansett. At the meeting, members were encouraged {{to buy into the}} club by purchasing shares. The float ended up raising over $3million and helped to keep the club solvent through the next decade.|$|E
25|$|I didn't write any {{songs in}} Henderson, {{but it was}} there I {{realized}} that experiences I had had, things I had seen and heard could be set down {{in a kind of}} music characteristic of my race.

25|$|As a {{specific}} example, {{refer to the}} circularly polarized wave in the first animation. Using this convention that wave is defined as right-handed because when one points one's right thumb {{in the same direction}} of the wave’s propagation, the fingers of that hand curl in the same direction of the field’s temporal rotation. It is considered clockwise circularly polarized <b>because</b> <b>from</b> {{the point of view of}} the source, looking in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, the field rotates in the clockwise direction. The second animation is that of left-handed or anti-clockwise light using this same convention.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of named localities in and around Darlinghurst {{including}} Taylor Square, Three Saints Square, Kings Cross and confusingly also East Sydney. Locals have used this name to refer to the area immediately around Stanley Street in the suburb's west, however the title is used more broadly throughout the area from Wooloomooloo up to Taylor Square where the old Darlinghurst Gaol still has the words East Sydney in brass lettering above the main entrance. This is <b>because</b> <b>from</b> 1900 to 1969 the entire area to the east of Sydney's CBD, from the harbour to Redfern, was an electorate known as the Division of East Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Heisenberg gave, as an illustration, the {{measurement}} of the position and momentum of an electron using a photon of light. In measuring the electron's position, the higher {{the frequency of the}} photon, the more accurate is {{the measurement}} of the position {{of the impact of the}} photon with the electron, but the greater is the disturbance of the electron. This is <b>because</b> <b>from</b> the impact with the photon, the electron absorbs a random amount of energy, rendering the measurement obtained of its momentum increasingly uncertain (momentum is velocity multiplied by mass), for one is necessarily measuring its post-impact disturbed momentum from the collision products and not its original momentum. With a photon of lower frequency, the disturbance (and hence uncertainty) in the momentum is less, but so is the accuracy of {{the measurement of}} the position of the impact.|$|E

500|$|The Catechism states: [...] "Human life {{is sacred}} <b>because</b> <b>from</b> its {{beginning}} {{it involves the}} creative action of God and it remains forever in a special relationship with the Creator, who is its sole end.... no one can under any circumstance claim for himself the right directly to destroy an innocent human being." [...] Direct and intentional killing of an innocent human is considered a mortal sin.

500|$|With Central Syria captured, the Muslims {{had dealt}} a decisive {{blow to the}} Byzantines. The {{communication}} between Northern Syria and Palestine was now cut off. Abu Ubaidah decided to march to Fahl (Pella), which is about [...] below sea level, and where a strong Byzantine garrison and survivors of Battle of Ajnadayn were present. The region was crucial <b>because</b> <b>from</b> here the Byzantine army could strike eastwards and cut the supply lines and communications to Arabia. Moreover, with this large garrison at the rear, Palestine could not be invaded. The Muslim army moved to Fahl with Khalid leading the advance guard, {{only to find the}} plain being flooded by Byzantines engineers blocking the Jordan River. The Byzantine army was eventually defeated at the Battle of Fahl on the night 23 January 635.|$|E
500|$|A 30-second clip for the {{fragrance}} surfaced on the Internet in January 2014 and several publications reported and speculated {{it would be}} the commercial for Rise. A commercial was later officially released in February and was shot by Jake Nava with whom Beyoncé had collaborated frequently. It opens with shots of her showered in gold as she rises out of a glittering bowl formed of dust while dramatic music plays in the background; several of the scenes are filmed using a slow motion technique. Her voiceover is heard in the background, [...] "You can let yourself disappear, or you can stir things up. Never settle, shake loose. Embrace the elements. <b>Because</b> <b>from</b> now on, you will always Rise!". Beyoncé is seen surrounded by glittery ashes, wearing thigh-high gladiator sandals and a bodysuit noted to be Amazonian-inspired.|$|E

500|$|The 767s were {{launched}} as [...] "First Business Class" [...] to charter travelers, but the business model was not successful. The new consumer groups entering the market had low willingness to pay, {{and the demand}} for premium charter services was low. The company was faced with not being able to charter out the plane because of the low seat numbers, but could not put in the extra seats because of the aircraft also being used on the scheduled market. Using so large aircraft on the short-haul flights in Southern Norway gave little economy-of-scale, and the airline seldom needed the increased capacity. Braathens SAFE also had problems, <b>because</b> <b>from</b> order to delivery, the exchange rates had increased from 5 to 9 NOK per USD, almost doubling the price in NOK. In 1986, the two 767s where sold. Two years later, Altas Resor was sold, and the following year Saga. Braathens SAFE closed its bases in Gothenburg and Stockholm, but remained a charter operator with 737s from Norway.|$|E
500|$|In Dragon's Egg, Forward {{describes}} {{the history and}} development of a life form (the Cheela) that evolves {{on the surface of}} a neutron star (a highly dense collapsed star, about 20km in diameter). [...] This is the [...] "dragon's egg" [...] of the title, so named <b>because</b> <b>from</b> Earth it is observed to be near the tail of the constellation Draco ("the dragon"). [...] The Cheela develop sentience and intelligence, despite their relative small size (an individual Cheela has approximately the volume of a sesame seed, but the weight of a human) and an intense gravity field that restricts their movement in the third dimension. Much of the book concerns the biologic and social development of the Cheela; a subplot is the arrival of a human vessel nearby the neutron star, and the eventual contact that is made between the humans and the Cheela. A major problem in this contact is that the Cheela live a million times more quickly than humans do; a Cheela year goes by in about 30 human seconds.|$|E

She felt that Sarah had to often clung on to people and believing that {{ultimately}} it would make her happy. Sarah tries this notion with Zoe, describing this Batley added: [...] "I think that's what happened with Zoe as well because they were such good friends. With Lydia, she brought something to her and she got on with her and was sparky, which is something that Sarah liked. I don't know if she'd suddenly turned, though. Maybe she was more bisexual than anything." ...|$|E
