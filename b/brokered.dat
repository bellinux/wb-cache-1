40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} split commissions on <b>broker</b> effort in MLS sales. The joint effort of <b>brokers</b> to find a buyer for a given listing is maximized when the <b>broker</b> who locates a buyer first receives the entire commission. In contrast, splitting the commission between the listing and finding <b>broker</b> (when they differ) maximizes the joint profits of <b>brokers.</b> When competition among <b>brokers</b> to acquire listings is considered, however, the split <b>brokers</b> most prefer entails a smaller (though still positive) share for the listing <b>broker</b> {{in order to reduce}} wasteful competition for listings. While sellers still prefer to pay only the <b>broker</b> who finds a buyer, <b>brokers</b> may not be willing to acquire and share listings under such an arrangement.

40|$|Abstract. In many {{developing}} democracies local party <b>brokers</b> distribute mate-rial benefits to voters. Yet {{we find that}} many <b>brokers</b> consume a share of these goods. This raises important puzzles. Why do party bosses rely on <b>brokers</b> who take goods {{that could be used}} to win votes? Why do voters support parties whose <b>brokers</b> take their goods? We argue that <b>brokers</b> must be compensated for the voters they mobilize. Bosses can motivate some <b>brokers</b> with the promise of polit-ical careers, but these careers are scarce. Thus, bosses tolerate many <b>brokers</b> who steal resources for their compensation. Since a <b>broker’s</b> mobilizing effort gives a boss incentives to channel resources to a <b>broker’s</b> constituency, voters also tolerate <b>brokers</b> who skim some resources to compensate themselves for the costs of their effort. We develop our argument formally, and evaluate it with extensive qualita-tive evidence and a unique survey of <b>brokers</b> in Argentina...|$|R

Third, the <b>broker</b> pool’s processes must be flexible to cope with different <b>broker</b> behaviors, making flexibility another objective.
