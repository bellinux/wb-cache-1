5|$|A <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> was the {{resistance}} of the Shipbuilding Commissariat which said {{it would be impossible to}} lay down any ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental changes could be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy saw no reason why new ships, reflecting wartime experience, could not be laid down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the Shipbuilding Commissariat in that most ships of the program would be improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to be laid down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220mm and 305mm guns.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Krycek head to {{a subway}} station, where Dr. Girardi is {{expected}} to arrive for Grissom's funeral. Mulder sees Cole there, and Cole seems to shoot Girardi, but this is shown to be in Mulder's head. In reality, Cole has captured Girardi and holds him hostage, about to show him a similar fate as his other victims. By searching surveillance footage, they track his location and find Girardi wounded. Mulder finds Cole, who is ready to kill himself. Krycek, believing Cole is holding a gun instead of the Bible he is actually holding, shoots him, and Cole dies of his wounds. Mulder and Scully find both of their files on the case missing. Krycek reports to the Smoking Man and others, telling them that {{the dissolution of the}} X-Files and the separation of Mulder and Scully has been ineffective, and their determination is only stronger. He also notes that Scully is a <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> than they anticipated.|$|E
25|$|The United States also {{assisted}} the Chinese Air Force. The Air Corps conducted {{most of the}} training for the Chinese at three Arizona installations: Luke, Williams, and Thunderbird Fields. Training the Chinese presented some special challenges. Because of their small stature some students could not reach all the controls. That problem was usually solved {{through the use of}} extra cushions and occasionally by switching them to another type of airplane. A <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> was the language barrier. It took all the interpreters the Air Corps could muster to support the training programs for the Chinese. In the end, 3,553 Chinese received flying and technical training, including 866 pilots.|$|E

25|$|This was {{a pivotal}} time {{for women in}} higher education, {{particularly}} at Michigan. Lloyd knew this and dealt with it in a reserved and mature manner, especially {{when it came to}} women's hours and overcrowding in housing. She wrote editorials in the Daily, attempting {{to bridge the gap between}} faculty and students. This was frequently a sore spot due to the shifting position over in loco parentis, which was causing an irritation amongst the student body in regards to the strict curfew hours women held. Additionally, the lack of student housing for women with the influx of students was turning into a <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> than seen in past years.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} assumptions as well. According to Richard L. Jensen, cyclical unemployment was a grave matter primarily until 1935. Between 1935 and 1941 structural unemployment became the <b>bigger</b> <b>problem.</b> Especially the unions successes in demanding higher wages pushed management into introducing new efficiency-oriented hiring standards. It ended inefficient labor such as child labor, casual unskilled work for subminimum wages, and sweatshop conditions. In {{the long term}} the shift to efficiency wages led to high productivity, high wages and a high standard of living. But it necessitated a well-educated, well-trained, hard-working labor force. It was not before war time brought full employment that the supply of unskilled labor (that caused structural unemployment) downsized.|$|E
25|$|The {{studies that}} {{conclude}} abuse is a <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> in military families than civilian families attribute {{this to the}} long hours, frequent disruptions in lifestyles, and high degree of stress. They point out that military families may be more reluctant to report issues of abuse {{because of the potential}} impact on the service member's career. Other studies, however, argue that military families have a smaller problem than civilian families because military culture offers more accessible help for victims of abuse. Military families have health care, housing, and family support programs often unavailable to lower income civilian families. Abusive family members {{are more likely to be}} ordered (by their commanding officer or base commander) to obtain treatment, thus reducing reoccurrences of abuse.|$|E

25|$|A {{divide and}} conquer {{algorithm}} repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem {{to one or more}} smaller instances of the same problem (usually recursively) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of {{divide and conquer}} is merge sorting. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments. A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called a decrease and conquer algorithm, that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the <b>bigger</b> <b>problem.</b> Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so the conquer stage is more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of decrease and conquer algorithm is the binary search algorithm.|$|E
25|$|Searle {{offers a}} variant of his Chinese room argument, calling it the Chess Room Argument, where instead of {{answering}} questions in Chinese, the man in a room is playing chess. Or rather, as Searle explains, he is inside the room manipulating symbols which are meaningless to him, while his actions result in winning chess games outside the room. Searle concludes that like a computer, the man has no understanding of chess. Searle compares Deep Blue's victory to {{the manner in which}} a pocket calculator can beat humans at arithmetic; he adds that it is no more significant than a steel robot which is too tough for human beings to tackle during a game of American football. Kurzweil counters that the very same argument could be made of the human brain, since the individual neurons have no true understanding of the <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> the brain is working on but, added together, they produce what is known as consciousness.|$|E

[...] The Financial Times observed that [...] "Clive Sinclair's offices are filled with returned computers which can take months to be repaired." [...] The company's slowness in replacing returns and delivering freshly ordered machines meant that Sinclair Research gained a reputation for poor customer service.|$|E

When King Abdullah appointed women to the advisory Shura Council {{for the first time in}} January 2013, al-Sharif criticized the reform as too small, noting that the Council was still not an elected body and could not pass legislation. In February, she worked to bring international attention to the case of five-year-old Lama al-Ghamdi, whose father Fayhan al-Ghamdi fatally raped, beat, and burned her; he served four months in jail and paid 1,000,000 riyals (roughly US$267,000) in blood money. On October 7, 2013, it was announced that Al-Ghamdi had been sentenced to 8 years in prison, plus 800 lashes.|$|E

500|$|One {{prototype}} {{was ordered}} from ÄŒeskomoravskÃ¡ Kolben-DanÄ›k in 1931, but development {{was slow and}} it was accepted only in November 1932. Its evaluations were very positive and an order for fifty was placed on 19 April 1933. The first six of these were to serve as pre-production models and were to be delivered by 30 September 1933. The delivery date for the next batch of twenty-four was a year after that and the final batch of twenty was due by 30 July 1935. Production was delayed by quality problems with the initial batch of armor plates from Poldi and delivery of the pre-production series did not occur until 23 April 1934. A <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> was that the Army had rejected ÄŒKD's proposed armament of a [...] Vickers 44/60 gun and two ZB vz. 26 machine guns so the contract was signed with no design work on the desired armament configuration. ÄŒKD did not finalize its design until December 1933 and the first six tanks were delivered with only a pair of ZB vz. 26 machine guns. The last tanks were delivered on 14 January 1936, but the six pre-production models had {{to be returned to}} the factory to be upgraded with the proper armament and otherwise modified up to the latest standards.

500|$|Modern Warfare â€“ Reflex Edition was ported by Treyarch. The Wii {{version of}} Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare has fewer {{features}} {{than the other}} console versions. It does not support split-screen multiplayer, and the graphics are not as developed. However, it supports co-operative gameplay in the campaign on a single screen. At any moment, a second Wii remote can be activated giving the second player their own aiming crosshairs. The game received an aggregated score of 76% on Metacritic. IGN gave the Wii version of the game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare â€“ Reflex Edition, a score of 7.0, saying the visuals and pointer controls are not as polished as the Wii version of , though they did mention the customization options and multiplayer are impressive. Official Nintendo Magazine gave it 80%, praising it for packing everything from its next-gen counterpart, but again criticizing the visuals. GameTrailers gave the game an 8.8, saying that despite some sacrifices, it retains everything good from its original version. Game Informer scored the game at a 6.5, stating that while the game was rather poor graphically, even by Wii standards, the <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> was the Wii remote, stating {{that it did not}} have enough buttons to support Modern Warfare's control scheme, and also that it was quite imprecise, contrasting it with the dual analog system used by the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, and the mouse and keyboard system on the Windows version of the game.
