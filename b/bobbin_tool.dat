40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is {{the fastest}} {{evolving}} joining technology and the principal prospective technique for implementing integral fuselage structure in aircraft manufacturing. The viability of FS welds is dependent upon mechanical properties and production turnovers, which are dependent on welding rates and tool design. This dissertation is about the multiobjective characterisation of aeronautical alloys (AA 5083 -H 111, AA 6056 -T 4, AA 6082 - H 111) friction stir welded using the standard FSW tools, scrolled shoulder Triflat tool, and the <b>Bobbin</b> <b>tool</b> respectively. The effects of defects and microstructure on the mechanical behaviour of AA 5083 -H 111 welds made from the standard tool were examined. SEM analysis showed that tunnel defects resulted from partial consolidation {{at the root of}} the weld, and the microstructure of the weld zones determined the failure mechanisms along the weld. The effect of welding and rotational speeds on the integrity of AA 6056 -T 4 FS welds produced with scrolled shoulder Triflat tool was studied. Increased welding speeds and advance per revolution led to improvements in mechanical properties and reduction in residual stresses maxima. The retreating side TMAZ, which was the microhardness minimum and tensile residual stress maximum, was also the failure location in most of the welds, hence the microstructure and properties in this region were critical to the integrity of the weld. Bend properties of the welds from the Triflat tool were good, because of the absence of root flaws. The influence of two different tool designs (standard tool and standard <b>Bobbin</b> <b>tool)</b> on mechanical behaviour and microstructure of AA 6082 -T 6 was also studied. The standard tool produced welds with better static properties than the <b>bobbin</b> <b>tool,</b> but most of the specimens failed prematurely, and root bending resulted in cracks, because of alumina rich layers in the weld nugget and root flaws. <b>Bobbin</b> <b>tool</b> welds had lower mechanical properties (70...|$|E

The effect of aging condition (pre- and post-welding T 78 tempering, respectively) and welding technology on fatigue crack {{growth has been}} evaluated. The effect of aging condition is dominating, as residual stresses are relieved during post-weld aging for both friction stir welding technologies.

Aluminium sheets of AA 6056 (Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloy), were welded {{by the standard}} FSW and <b>bobbin</b> <b>tool</b> techniques.

40|$|The high {{potential}} of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is already {{widely used in}} industrial applications. In combination with a suitable machine concept, this technology is appropriate for small components and can be extended to applications on structures of several meters in length. Using a 3 D-capable system that is stiff enough to handle the high process forces, machining and friction stir welding of complex geometries {{can be carried out}} directly in one set-up. In order to ensure reproducible, high quality welds, appropriate control strategies are needed. Furthermore the use of various tool types such as standard or <b>bobbin</b> <b>tools</b> can extend the range of weldable geometries tremendously. The aforementioned aspects have been part of process development work for FSW at Fraunhofer IWS Dresden in the last few years. Within the current paper interesting findings are discussed in detail. This includes the realization of a fully 3 D-capable FSW machine based on a so-called Pentapod concept. This parallel-kinematic system is suitable for large and complex three-dimensional structures up to 7 meters in length. The FSW research is focused on the welding of aircraft structures and mixed-material joints; examples of research projects and their results are given. Selected welding examples of wrought and cast aluminum, high strength alloys and copper will be presented as well as experiences, which have been made in terms of process development and process control...|$|R
40|$|PROBLEM - The bobbin {{friction}} stir welding (BFSW) {{process has}} potential benefits for welding thin sheet aluminium alloy. The main benefits of {{friction stir welding}} over conventional thermal welding processes are minimisation of energy usage, no need for consumables, potential for good weld quality without porosity, no fumes, minimal adverse environmental effects (green), minimal waste (lean), and reduced threats to personal health and safety. The BFSW process has further advantages over conventional friction stir welding (CFSW) in the reduction of welding forces, faster welding, and less fixturing. It is especially attractive to industries that join thin sheet material, e. g. boat-building. The industrial need for this project arose from the desire to apply the technology at a ship manufacturing company, INCAT located in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. However there are peculiar difficulties with the specific grade of material used in this industry, namely thin sheet aluminium Al 6082 -T 6. Early efforts with a portable friction stir welding machine identified the process to have low repeatability and reproducibility, i. e. process-instability. There are {{a large number of}} process variables and situational factors that affect weld quality, and many of these are covert. This is also the reason for divergent recommendations in the literature for process settings. PURPOSE - The main purpose of this research was to identify covert variables and better understand their potentially adverse effects on weld quality. Therefore, this thesis investigated the hidden variables and their interactions. Developing this knowledge is a necessity for making reliable and repeatable welds for industrial application. APPROACH - An explorative approach that focused on the functional perspective was taken. An extensive empirical testing programme was undertaken to identify the variables and their effects. In the process a force platform and BFSW tools were designed and built. A variety of machine platforms were used, namely portable friction stir welding, manual milling machine and computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine. The trials were grouped into 14 test plans. These are tool shoulder gap, spindle and travel speed, tool features, machines, tool fixation, machinery, welding direction, plate size (width and dimension), support insulation, tool materials, substrate properties and fixation. For the welded plates besides visual inspection of the weld, current, force, and temperature were measured. The Fourier transform was used to analyse the frequency response of machines. Also the welded samples were tested to the maritime standards of Det Norske Veritas (DNV). A number of relationships of causality were identified whereby certain variables affected weld quality. A model was developed to represent the proposed causality using the IDEF 0 systems engineering method. FINDINGS - From these trials six main variables have been identified. These are tool features, spindle speed, travel speed, shoulder gap compression, machine variability, tool and substrate fixation. A rigid system is required for a consistent weld results. Under this condition, full pin features (threads and flats) need to be used to balance the adverse effects of individual features. It has been shown that fabricated <b>bobbin</b> <b>tools</b> with sharp edges can cause cuts and digging thus this feature should be avoided. Additionally, the substrate should have continuous interaction with the tool so the shoulder interference needs to be fixed and well-controlled. It is found that the compression generated by the shoulder towards the substrate helps material grabbing for better tool-substrate interaction. It is also shown that tool entry causes ejection of material and hence an enduring mass deficit, which manifests as a characteristic tunnel defect. The new explanation of the formation, origin and location of this defect has been explained. Material transportation mechanisms within the weld have been elucidated. It is also found that the role of the travel speed is not only to control heat generation but also for replacing the deficit material. Additionally, heat supplied to the weld depends not only on thickness, but also the width of the plate. Different types of machine cause an interaction in the material flow through their controller strategies. Jerking motion can occur at a slow travel speed, which also alters the way material is being transported. The Fourier transform (FFT) has been used to identify the characteristics of good and bad BFSW welds. This {{has the potential to be}} expanded for real-time process control. IMPLICATIONS - Tool deflection and positioning, material flow and availability are identified as affecting weld quality through stated mechanisms. The impact is even more severe when involving thin-plate aluminium. For the industry to successfully adopt this technology the process typically needs tight control of shoulder gap, tool strength and stiffness, feature fabrication, substrate and tool fixation. Additionally spindle and travel speed need to be adjusted not only based on the type of materials and thickness, but also the width, type of machine and method of tool entry. ORIGINALITY - New data are presented, which lead to new insights into the welding mechanics, production settings, material transportation and weld defects for BFSW on thin sheet material. The conventional idea that the welding tool has a semi-steady interaction with the substrate is not supported. Instead the interaction is highly dynamic, and this materially affects the weld-quality, especially in the difficult-to-weld material under examination. Factors such as shoulder gap, tool and substrate fixation compliance and machine types emerge as variables that need to be given attention in the selection of process parameters. The causal relationships have been represented in a conceptual model using an IDEF 0 system approach. This study has made several original contributions to the body of knowledge. First is the identification of previously hidden variables that effect weld formation for the fixed gap BFSW process. The second contribution is a new way of understanding the material transportation mechanics within the weld. This includes the flow around the pin in the plane of the weld, the vertical transportation of material up the pin, the formation of turbulent-like knit lines at the advancing side, and the formation of tunnel defects. Also included here is a new understanding of how material deficit arises at tool entry and exit, and from flash/chips, and how this contributes to the tunnel weld defect. In addition, new understandings of the role of feed rate have been identified. Related to the material transportation, the work has also identified the importance of an interference fit between the substrate and tool. A third contribution is the identification of the dynamic interaction between tool and substrate. This identifies the important role rigidity plays. Associated with this is the identification of frequency characteristics of the motors under load. The fourth contribution is identification of the specific process settings for the difficult-to-weld material of AL 6082 -T 6. The fifth contribution is the development of a novel method of fabricating bobbin friction stir welding tools as embodied in a patent application...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The use of {{a double}} sided {{friction}} stir welding tool (known as a <b>bobbin</b> <b>tool)</b> {{has the advantage of}} giving a processed zone in the workpiece which is more or less rectangular in cross section, as opposed the triangular zone which is more typically found when conventional friction stir welding tool designs are used. In addition, the net axial force on the workpiece is almost zero, which has significant beneficial implications in machine design and cost. However, the response of these tools in generating fine microstructures in the nugget area has not been established. The paper presents detailed metallographic analyses of microstructures produced in 25 mm AA 6082 -T 6 aluminium wrought alloy, and examines grain size, texture and mechanical properties as a function of processing parameters and tool design, and offers comparison with data from welds made with conventional tools...|$|E
40|$|Conventional and bobbin {{friction}} stir {{welding processes}} (FSW and BFSW, respectively) were employed for joining 10 mm thick extruded AA 6005 -T 6 profiles. The FSW and BFSW techniques were employed using two sets of parameters resulting in slow and fast processes. In general, the <b>bobbin</b> <b>tool</b> enabled welding with faster welding speeds than the conventional FSW technique. A comprehensive in-situ thermal analysis was performed using thermocouples. It was evident that, in a like-for-like comparison, i. e., employing {{the same set of}} welding parameters, the BFSW technique introduces a somewhat higher peak temperature, however, lower heat input and, more importantly, a higher cooling rate than the conventional FSW. Accordingly, a somewhat finer microstructure was formed in the stir zone of the BFSW samples than in the FSW ones, resulting in higher hardness values, and slightly higher ultimate strengths in the BFSW samples...|$|E

40|$|The {{friction}} coefficient in many {{friction stir welding}} researches is generally used as an effective, constant value without concern on the adaptable and changeable nature of the friction during welding sequence. This is understandable because the main problem in analyzing friction in friction stir welding are complex nature of the friction processes, case-dependent and time dependent contact between the bodies, influence of the temperature, sliding velocity, etc. This paper is presenting a complex experimental-numerical-analytical model for estimating the effective {{friction coefficient}} on contact of the <b>bobbin</b> <b>tool</b> and welding plates during welding, considering the temperature at the contact as the most influencing parameter on friction. The estimation criterion is the correspondence of the experimental temperature and temperature from the numerical model. The estimation procedure is iterative and parametric - the heat transport parameters and friction coefficient are adapted during the estimation procedure in a realistic manner to achieve relative difference between experimental and model’s temperature lower than 3 %. The results show that friction coefficient varies from 0. 01 to 0. 21 for steel-aluminium alloy contact and temperature range from 406 °C to 22 °C...|$|E
