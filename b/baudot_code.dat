5|$|The artwork for X was {{designed}} by graphic design duo Tappin Gofton, formed by Mark Tappin and Simon Gofton; Mark Tappin had previously worked for Coldplay on the Parachutes album cover and the covers of the singles therefrom. The image, which is visualized {{through a combination of}} colours and blocks, is a graphical representation of the <b>Baudot</b> <b>code,</b> an early form of telegraph communication using a series of ones and zeros to communicate. The code was developed by Frenchman Émile Baudot in the 1870s, and was a widely used method of terrestrial and telegraph communication.|$|E
5|$|X (stylized as X & Y) is {{the third}} studio album by the British rock band Coldplay. It was {{released}} on 6 June 2005 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom, and a day later by Capitol Records in the United States. The album was produced by Coldplay and producer Danton Supple. It is noted for its troubled and urgent development, with producer Ken Nelson having originally been tasked with producing much of the album; however, many songs written during his sessions were discarded owing to the band's dissatisfaction with them. The album's cover art {{is a combination of}} colours and blocks, which is a representation of the <b>Baudot</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
25|$|The next {{improvement}} was the <b>Baudot</b> <b>code</b> of 1874. French engineer Émile Baudot patented a printing telegraph {{in which the}} signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a unique code based on the sequence of just five contacts. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.|$|E
50|$|<b>Baudot's</b> <b>code</b> {{became known}} as International Telegraph Alphabet No. 1 (ITA1), {{and is no longer}} used.|$|R
5000|$|In the 5-bit <b>Baudot</b> <b>codes,</b> BEL is {{represented}} by the number 11 (...) when in [...] "figures" [...] mode.|$|R
50|$|In 1897 the Baudot {{system was}} {{improved}} by switching to punched tape, which was prepared offline like the Morse tape {{used with the}} Wheatstone and Creed systems. A tape reader, controlled by the Baudot distributor, then replaced the manual keyboard. The tape had five rows of holes for the code, with a sixth row of smaller holes for transporting the tape through the reader mechanism. <b>Baudot’s</b> <b>code</b> was later standardised as International Telegraph Alphabet Number One.|$|R
500|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{theme in}} the album is that everything is broken, out of place or missing; This is apparent in nearly all songs in the album. Examples include [...] "Fix You" [...] ("When you lose something you can't replace") and also in [...] "X" [...] ("When something is broken, {{and you try to}} fix it, trying to repair it, any way you can") and [...] "Talk" [...] ("Are you lost or incomplete? Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?"). This theme is also reflective of the random, incomprehensible pattern on the album's cover (until you [...] "fix" [...] it using the <b>Baudot</b> <b>Code).</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{alphabet}} of {{the code}} {{is presented in the}} liner notes of X. The track listing, included on the booklet, CD, and back of the album, uses [...] "X#" [...] on tracks 1 to 6 and [...] "Y#" [...] on tracks 7 to 12, rather than the conventional track numbering system. This is a reference to the title of the album. Many pages in the booklet include photos of the band working on the album. The final page of the booklet contains the slogan [...] "Make Trade Fair" [...] in the <b>Baudot</b> <b>code,</b> a reference to the name of the international organization which Chris Martin continues to support. The band dedicates the album to [...] "BWP" [...] that is presented also inside the liner notes; it stands for Bruce W. Paltrow, the late father of Martin's wife at the time, Gwyneth Paltrow. All singles released from the album feature their titles in the same code on their respective covers. Martin sometimes wears coloured tape on his hands while on stage, as a reference to the album.|$|E
2500|$|By 1935, {{message routing}} {{was the last}} great barrier to full automation. Large {{telegraphy}} providers began to develop systems that used telephone-like rotary dialling to connect teletypewriters. These machines were called [...] "Telex" [...] (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style pulse dialling for circuit switching and then sent data by <b>Baudot</b> <b>code.</b> This [...] "type A" [...] Telex routing functionally automated message routing.|$|E
5000|$|During 1901 <b>Baudot's</b> <b>code</b> was {{modified}} by Donald Murray (1865-1945), prompted by his {{development of a}} typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate step, a keyboard perforator, which allowed an operator to punch a paper tape, and a tape transmitter for sending the message from the punched tape. At {{the receiving end of}} the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a reperforator could be used to make a perforated copy of the message. As there was no longer a direct correlation between the operator's hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue, and instead Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery, assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most frequently used characters. The Murray code also introduced what became known as [...] "format effectors" [...] or [...] "control characters" [...] - the CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed) codes. A few of <b>Baudot's</b> <b>codes</b> moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent.|$|R
5000|$|After three months, the Research Section {{handed the}} task to {{mathematician}} Bill Tutte. He applied {{a technique that}} he had been taught in his cryptographic training, of writing out the key by hand and looking for repetitions. Tutte did this with the original teleprinter 5-bit <b>Baudot</b> <b>codes,</b> which led him to his initial breakthrough of recognising a 41 character repetition. Over the following two months up to January 1942, Tutte and colleagues worked out the complete logical structure of the cipher machine. This remarkable piece of reverse engineering was later described as [...] "one of the greatest intellectual feats of World War II".|$|R

2500|$|Early {{teleprinters}} {{used the}} ITA-1 <b>Baudot</b> <b>code,</b> a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, {{so it was}} over-defined into two [...] "shifts", [...] "letters", and [...] "figures". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901, Baudot's code was modified by Donald Murray and around 1930, the CCITT introduced the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) code as an international standard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} (or [...] "Baudot") radioteletype {{system is}} based almost invariably on the <b>Baudot</b> <b>code</b> or ITA-2 5 bit alphabet. The link {{is based on}} character asynchronous transmission with 1 start bit and 1, 1.5 or 2 stop bits. Transmitter modulation is normally FSK (F1B). Occasionally, an AFSK signal modulating an RF carrier (A2B, F2B) is used on VHF or UHF frequencies. Standard transmission speeds are 45.45, 50, 75, 100, 150 and 300 baud.|$|E
2500|$|Jacquard loom, Hollerith punch cards, {{telegraphy}} and telephony—the electromechanical relay: Bell and Newell (1971) {{indicate that}} the Jacquard loom (1801), precursor to Hollerith cards (punch cards, 1887), and [...] "telephone switching technologies" [...] were the roots of a tree leading {{to the development of}} the first computers. By the mid-19th century the telegraph, the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, its discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as [...] "dots and dashes" [...] a common sound. By the late 19th century the ticker tape (ca 1870s) was in use, as was the use of Hollerith cards in the 1890 U.S. census. Then came the teleprinter (ca. 1910) with its punched-paper use of <b>Baudot</b> <b>code</b> on tape.|$|E
5000|$|The Murray code also {{introduced}} {{what became known}} as [...] "format effectors" [...] or [...] "control characters" [...] the CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed) codes. A few of <b>Baudot's</b> <b>codes</b> moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent, but the same code was used to encode the space separation between words. Sequences of DEL codes (fully punched columns) were used at start or end of messages or between them, allowing easy separation of distinct messages (BELL codes could be inserted in those sequences to signal to the remote operator that a new message was coming or that transmission of a message was terminated).|$|R
5000|$|The Mark 1 machine {{worked in}} integer {{arithmetic}} and, {{because of their}} background in radar, the engineers had built the machine to display the lines on the CRTs with the most significant bit on the right. This could be argued as logically sensible, but was changed for the more conventional system for the Mark 1*, which also worked in fractions, not integers. Also, the <b>Baudot</b> teleprinter <b>code</b> was abandoned for one {{that was in the}} following order.|$|R
50|$|The KW-26 used an NSA-developed {{encryption}} algorithm based on shift registers. The algorithm produced a continuous stream of bits that were xored {{with the five}} bit <b>Baudot</b> teleprinter <b>code</b> to produce ciphertext on the transmitting end and plaintext on the receiving end. In NSA terminology, this stream of bits is called the key. The information needed to initialize the algorithm, what most cryptographers today would call the key, NSA calls a cryptovariable. Typically each KW-26 was given a new cryptovariable once a day.|$|R
50|$|Escape {{sequences}} {{date back}} at least to the 1874 <b>Baudot</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 1901, <b>Baudot</b> <b>code</b> {{contained}} separate carriage return and line feed characters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Baudot</b> <b>code</b> {{may include}} a figure space. It is {{character}} 23 on the Hughes telegraph typewheel.|$|E
50|$|The BETI was {{designed}} as a low cost serial terminal operating at speeds of up to 4800 baud (1200 baud without handshaking). The BETI also provides optional automatic code conversion to and from the <b>baudot</b> 5 level <b>code</b> used for RTTY and TELEX applications.|$|R
5000|$|Members of the {{programming}} team found it useful {{to commit to}} memory the following sequence of characters which represented the numbers 0 to 31 in the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 1 (<b>Baudot)</b> 5-bit binary <b>code</b> of the paper tape that was used for input and output.|$|R
5000|$|In 1874, the five-bit <b>Baudot</b> {{telegraph}} <b>code</b> and {{a matching}} 5-key chord keyboard {{was designed to}} be used with the operator forming the codes manually. The code is optimized for speed and low wear: chords were chosen so that the most common characters used the simplest chords. But telegraph operators were already using typewriters with QWERTY keyboards to [...] "copy" [...] received messages, and at the time it made more sense to build a typewriter that could generate the codes automatically, rather than making them learn to use a new input device.|$|R

50|$|The Teletype packs three {{characters}} in each 18-bit word; each character a 5-bit <b>Baudot</b> <b>code</b> and an upper-case bit.|$|E
50|$|US {{implementations}} of <b>Baudot</b> <b>code</b> {{may differ}} in {{the addition of a}} few characters, such as #, & on the FIGS layer.|$|E
50|$|In 1874, <b>Baudot</b> {{developed}} the <b>code</b> {{that would eventually}} {{take the place of}} Morse code by applying the theory of binary de Bruijn necklaces. The problem continued from Sainte-Marie to Martin in 1934, who began looking at algorithms to make words of the de Bruijn structure. It was then worked on by Posthumus in 1943.|$|R
5000|$|Reflected binary codes {{were applied}} to {{mathematical}} puzzles before they became known to engineers. Martin Gardner wrote a popular account of the Gray code in his August 1972 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American. The French engineer Émile <b>Baudot</b> used Gray <b>codes</b> in telegraphy in 1878. [...] He received the French Legion of Honor medal for his work. The Gray code is sometimes attributed, incorrectly, to Elisha Gray.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Baudot's</b> {{original}} <b>code</b> {{was adapted}} {{to be sent}} from a manual keyboard, and no teleprinter equipment was ever constructed that used it in its original form. The code was entered on a keyboard which had just five piano type keys, operated with two fingers of the left hand and three fingers of the right hand. Once the keys had been pressed they were locked down until mechanical contacts in a distributor unit passed over the sector connected to that particular keyboard, when the keyboard was unlocked {{ready for the next}} character to be entered, with an audible click (known as the [...] "cadence signal") to warn the operator. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.|$|R
50|$|J. M. Emile Baudot (1845-1903) {{worked out}} a five-level code (five bits per character) for {{telegraphs}} which was standardized internationally and is commonly called <b>Baudot</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory is}} that this name arose {{from the fact that}} character encodings used the same code for both the number sign and the British pound sign [...] "£". Claims have included ISO 646-GB as well as the <b>Baudot</b> <b>code</b> in the late 19th century. The apparent use of the sign to mean pounds weight in 1850 appears to rule out both of these code sets as the origin, though that same reference admits that the earliest reference in print was a decade after <b>Baudot</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Teletype Model 26 is a <b>Baudot</b> <b>code</b> page printer; a lower-cost machine using a typewheel. The platen {{and paper}} moved while typing, like a manual typewriter.|$|E
40|$|Émile Baudot’s {{printing}} telegraph was {{the first}} widely adopted device to encode letters, numbers, and symbols as uniform-length binary sequences. Donald Murray introduced a second successful code of this type, the details of which continued to evolve until versions of <b>Baudot’s</b> and Murray’s <b>codes</b> were standardized as International Telegraph Alphabets No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. These codes were used for decades before the appearance of computers and the changing needs of communications required the design and standardization of a new code. Years of debate and compromise resulted in the ECMA- 6 standard in Europe, the ASCII standard in the United States, and the ISO 646 and International Alphabet No. 5 standards internationally.

50|$|The Model 32 line {{used the}} same {{mechanism}} and looked identical, except for having a three-row keyboard and, on the ASR model, a five-level paper tape reader and punch, both appropriate for <b>Baudot</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Baudot</b> <b>code,</b> a five-bit encoding, {{was created}} by Émile Baudot in 1870, {{patented}} in 1874, modified by Donald Murray in 1901, and standardized by CCITT as International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) in 1930.|$|E
