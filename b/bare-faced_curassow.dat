50|$|The {{presence}} of guanacos {{has been confirmed}} in the sand-dunes in the south-east of the Natural Area. The white-lipped peccary, armadillo, giant armadillo, silvery marmoset, black howler monkey, pampas deer, <b>bare-faced</b> <b>curassow,</b> crowned eagle and black-and-white hawk-eagle {{can also be found}} here.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bare-faced</b> <b>curassow</b> {{lives in}} moist, semi-deciduous and gallery forests, often near {{the fringes of}} the woodland. It mainly feeds on fruit, but seeds, flowers and small {{invertebrates}} are also eaten. Breeding takes place in the summer {{in the southern part of}} its range, with the nests being platforms of sticks in trees.|$|E
5000|$|The {{evolution}} of the 4 southern species was somewhat more complex. In the Messinian, about 6-5.5 mya, the ancestors of the wattled curassow became isolated in the western Amazonas basin. With increasing aridification of southeastern Brazil, the ancestors of the red-billed curassow found refuge in the mountain ranges between the Brazilian Highlands and the Atlantic during the mid-Zanclean, some 4.5-4 mya. The divergence between the <b>bare-faced</b> and black <b>curassow</b> lineages apparently took place around the Uquian - Ensenadan boundary, some 1.5 mya. This which coincides with one or several period(s) of elevated sea levels during which the lower Amazonas basin was a brackish lagoon which offered little curassow habitat. Their present ranges are consequently still separated by the Amazonas river. (Pereira & Baker 2004) ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>bare-faced</b> <b>curassow</b> has a {{wide range}} and is fairly {{numerous}} in parts of its range, however it is subject to hunting and {{to the destruction of}} its habitat and the total population is likely to be declining quite rapidly. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as [...] "vulnerable".|$|E
50|$|The <b>bare-faced</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax fasciolata) is {{a species}} of bird in the Cracidae family, the chachalacas, guans, curassows, etc. It is found in eastern-central and {{southern}} Brazil, Paraguay, and eastern Bolivia, and extreme northeast Argentina, in the cerrado, pantanal, and the southeastern region of the Amazon basin. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.|$|E
5000|$|... 346 {{bird species}} have been recorded, {{although}} some are dubious.Species include <b>bare-faced</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax fasciolata), blue-winged macaw (Primolius maracana), blue-bellied parrot (Triclaria malachitacea), red-spectacled amazon (Amazona pretrei), purple-winged ground dove (Claravis geoffroyi), Temminck's seedeater (Sporophila falcirostris), Brazilian merganser (Mergus octosetaceus), grey-bellied hawk (Accipiter poliogaster), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and canebrake groundcreeper (Clibanornis dendrocolaptoides).The park is an important site for conserving the black-fronted piping guan (Pipile jacutinga) in Argentina.|$|E
50|$|Studies with plants, {{butterflies}} and birds classify this biological reserve {{as one of}} the 12 pleistocenic refuges in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest.It has lost more than half of its forest due to logging since its creation.Protected species are Kaapori capuchin (Cebus kaapori), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), jaguar (Panthera onca), <b>bare-faced</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax fasciolata), Amazonian barred woodcreeper (Dendrocolaptes certhia), black-spotted bare-eye (Phlegopsis nigromaculata), red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus), dark-winged trumpeter (Psophia viridis) and pearly parakeet (Pyrrhura lepida).|$|E
50|$|During {{the annual}} floods, {{deciduous}} forests {{are the only}} places where there is dry ground. They become the only feeding grounds available for bird species like the undulated tinamou, the <b>bare-faced</b> <b>curassow,</b> and the several species of wild pigeon that occur in Cantão. Many mammal species that don't do well on trees or in flooded areas also seek refuge in these forests, which consequently become prime hunting ground for the park's two large terrestrial predators, the jaguar and the puma.|$|E
50|$|As a {{national}} park the basic objectives are preservation of natural ecosystems of great ecological relevance and scenic beauty, enabling scientific research, educational activities, outdoor recreation and eco-tourism. The park was created primarily {{because it is an}} untouched Cerrado area that is threatened by the recent expansion of the agricultural frontier in Maranhão. It also contains more than 400 springs of important waterways.Protected species in the park include the oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), cougar (Puma concolor), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), <b>bare-faced</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax fasciolata) and Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>bare-faced</b> <b>curassow</b> {{is a large}} bird {{reaching}} a length of 82 to 92 cm. The sexes differ in appearance. The male has black upper parts faintly glossed with greenish-olive, with an unfeathered face with yellowish bare skin, a small black crest, and white underparts. The female has a black head, throat, neck and upper mantle, and {{a black and white}} barred crest. The remainder of the upper parts are greenish-black barred with white or ochre. The black tail is tipped with white or ochre and the underparts are black with ochre barring on the breast, paling to a yellowish or ochre belly. The facial skin on females is blackish.|$|E
40|$|The <b>bare-faced</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax fasciolata) {{is a large}} Neotropical {{bird that}} suffers {{anthropogenic}} pressure across much of its range. A captive population is maintained for conservation management, {{although there has been}} no genetic screening of stocks. Based on the six microsatellite markers developed for Crax globulosa, the genetic variability of C. fasciolata and possible differences between a wild and a captive population were investigated. Only three loci were polymorphic, with a total of 27 alleles. More than half of these alleles were private to the wild (n = 8) or captive (n = 7) populations. Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were restricted to the captive population. Despite the number of private alleles, genetic drift has probably promoted differentiation between populations. Our results indicate that wild C. fasciolata populations are genetically impoverished and structured, but species-specific microsatellite markers will be necessary for a more reliable assessment of the species` genetic diversity.

40|$|The Cerrado is now {{considered}} the most threatened biome of South America. Northwestern Minas Gerais state, in southeastern Brazil, still harbors large areas of extreme importance for biological conservation of the Cerrado. The current study provides the first thorough assessment of the avifauna of a large remnant of Cerrado vegetation in this region, the Fazenda Brejão. Data {{are based on a}} bird survey conducted from November 1998 to January 2007. This area is a private property of 20. 000 ha preserved that lies in a region recognized for its palm groves, a pristine Cerrado (savannah-like vegetation) and gallery forests. Bird censuses were carried out through random transects censuses, mist-net captures and recording bird vocalizations. It was recorded 273 species, belonging to 56 families. This represents 32 % of all 857 bird species recorded for the Cerrado. Palm groves held approximately 42 % of all recorded species. We also recorded endemic species of Cerrado as well as adjacent biomes such as the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga. Regional threatened species were also recorded such as the Greater Rhea Rhea americana, the Chestnut-bellied Guan Penelope ochrogaster, the <b>Bare-faced</b> <b>Curassow</b> Crax fasciolata, the Black-and-white Hawk-eagle Spizastur melanoleucus, the Blue-and-yellow Macaw Ara ararauna, the Yellow-faced Parrot Alipiopsitta xanthops and the Minas Gerais Tyrannulet Phylloscartes roquettei. This species diversity reveals the biological importance of the region. The establishment of a natural reserve in the region will be an essential measure to guarantee the biological conservation of one of the best preserved areas of Cerrado to date in southeastern Brazil...|$|E
