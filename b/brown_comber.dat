40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the survival rates of three fish species, the <b>brown</b> <b>comber</b> (Serranus hepatus), black goby (Gobius niger) and annular seabream (Diplodus annularis), after their escape from a 40 mm stretched diamond mesh polyethylene (PE) codend. Experiments were {{carried out in the}} eastern Mediterranean in September 2007 using a conventional bottom trawl with 600 meshes around the mouth. A constant 15 min towing duration was used for all hauls. The towing speed varied between 2. 0 and 2. 5 knots. Codend covers, supported by two hoops, were used to retain escaping fish. At the end of each haul, these covers were detached from the codend, fixed to the sea floor at depths of 19 to 28 m, and then observed by the divers for a period of seven days. On the eighth day, all of the covers were lifted up and the survivors and mortalities were counted and measured. The mean survival percentages of open codend and experimental cages were found to be 97. 1 % and 98. 3 % for <b>brown</b> <b>comber,</b> 69. 0 % and 77. 2 % for black goby, and 97. 5 % and 98. 6 % for annular seabream respectively...|$|E
40|$|Age, {{growth and}} diet of <b>brown</b> <b>comber,</b> Serranus hepatus, were {{determined}} from specimens col-lected in Izmir Bay, Aegean Sea. Total length ranged from 5. 20 to 11. 70 cm, while weight varied between 1. 89 and 24. 97 g. The length-weight relationship was W= 0. 0157 *L 2. 998. Age {{was determined by}} otolith readings, where a maximum age of 4 years was observed. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated as L∞= 11. 90 cm, k= 0. 56, to=– 1. 14. Stomach content analysis revealed that the species is carnivorous, with benthic crustaceans constituting the main food in the overall diet composition...|$|E
40|$|Larval {{fish and}} hydrographic data were {{collected}} in Kavala Gulf (northern Aegean Sea) across a fine scale grid of 17 stations in two surveys, {{carried out in the}} beginning of July 2002 and 2003. Despite the different taxonomic resolution and excluding the unidentified larvae, 22 taxa were caught in 2002 and 27 in 2003. Seventeen taxa were present in both years' collections. A total of 833 larvae were collected during the two samplings. The adults of several larvae caught, although sometimes at very low concentrations, are species with high commercial value or represent a major proportion of the captured production of the northern Aegean Sea. The larvae of European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) were most abundant in both years followed by the <b>brown</b> <b>comber</b> (Serranus hepatus), the gobies (Gobius sp.) and, only for 2003, round sardinella (Sardinella aurita). Maximum anchovy larval densities reached 4145 / 10 m(2) and 13852 / 10 m(2) in the 2002 and 2003 surveys, respectively. The spatial extent Of anchovy larvae was also high as they were collected at 12 stations in 2002 and at 15 in 2003. Besides water circulation, the spatial distribution of fish larvae was largely influenced by temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen...|$|E
