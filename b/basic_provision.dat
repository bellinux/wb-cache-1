2500|$|The current Social Security formula used in {{calculating the}} benefit level (primary {{insurance}} amount or PIA) is progressive vis-à-vis lower average salaries. Anyone {{who worked in}} OASDI covered employment and other retirement would be entitled to both the alternative non-OASDI pension and an Old Age retirement benefit from Social Security. Because of their limited time working in OASDI covered employment the sum of their covered salaries times inflation factor divided by 420 months yields a low adjusted indexed monthly salary over 35 years, AIME. The progressive nature of the PIA formula would in effect allow these workers to also get a slightly higher Social Security Benefit percentage on this low average salary. Congress passed in 1983 the Windfall Elimination Provision to minimize Social Security benefits for these recipients. The <b>basic</b> <b>provision</b> {{is that the first}} salary bracket, $0–791/month (2013) has its normal benefit percentage of 90% reduced to 40–90%—see Social Security for the exact percentage. The reduction is limited to roughly 50% of what you would be eligible for if you had always worked under OASDI taxes. The 90% benefit percentage factor is not reduced if you have 30 or more years of [...] "substantial" [...] earnings.|$|E

5000|$|Some federal, state, {{local and}} {{education}} government employees pay no Social Security but {{have their own}} retirement, disability systems that nearly always pay much better retirement and disability benefits than Social Security. These plans typically requires vesting—working for 5-10 years for the same employer before becoming eligible for retirement. But their retirement typically only depends on {{the average of the}} best 3-10 years salaries times some retirement factor (typically 0.875%-3.0%) times years employed. This retirement benefit can be a [...] "reasonably good" [...] (75-85% of salary) retirement at close to the monthly salary they were last employed at. For example, if a person joined the University of California retirement system at age 25 and worked for 35 years they could receive 87.5% (2.5% × 35) of their average highest three year salary with full medical coverage at age 60. Police and firemen who joined at 25 and worked for 30 years could receive 90% (3.0% × 30) of their average salary and full medical coverage at age 55. These retirements have cost of living adjustments (COLA) applied each year but are limited to a maximum average income of $350,000/year or less. Spousal survivor benefits are available at 100-67% of the primary benefits rate for 8.7% to 6.7% reduction in retirement benefits, respectively. UCRP retirement and disability plan benefits are funded by contributions from both members and the university (typically 5% of salary each) and by the compounded investment earnings of the accumulated totals. These contributions and earnings are held in a trust fund that is invested. The retirement benefits are much more generous than Social Security but are believed to be actuarially sound. The main difference between state and local government sponsored retirement systems and Social Security is that the state and local retirement systems use compounded investments that are usually heavily weighted in the stock market securities—which historically have returned more than 7.0%/year on average despite some years with losses. Short term federal government investments may be [...] "more" [...] secure but pay much lower average percentages. Nearly all other federal, state and local retirement systems work in a similar fashion with different benefit retirement ratios. Some plans are now combined with Social Security and are [...] "piggy backed" [...] on top of Social Security benefits. For example, the current Federal Employees Retirement System, which covers the vast majority of federal civil service employees hired after 1986, combines Social Security, a modest defined-benefit pension (1.1% per year of service) and the defined-contribution Thrift Savings Plan. The current Social Security formula used in calculating the benefit level (primary insurance amount or PIA) is progressive vis-à-vis lower average salaries. Anyone who worked in OASDI covered employment and other retirement would be entitled to both the alternative non-OASDI pension and an Old Age retirement benefit from Social Security. Because of their limited time working in OASDI covered employment the sum of their covered salaries times inflation factor divided by 420 months yields a low adjusted indexed monthly salary over 35 years, AIME.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{potential}} for the adaptation of UK Shoreline Management Planning to address Ghana’s problems of coastal erosion and resultant shoreline retreat in an environmentally acceptable and sustainable way. Management strategies, past and existing, have largely focussed upon provision of hard protection at specific locations where risk levels to life and economic assets are high. There has been little commitment to the concepts of integration of management interventions with wider natural processes and longer-term sustainability. In most cases, such ‘ad hoc ’ management interventions classically tend to stabilise the shoreline at the protected section and aggravate the situation elsewhere along the shoreline (“knock-on effects”). Such problems have occurred previously on many other developed coastlines leading in recent decades to more holistic and potentially sustainable shoreline management methods (Hooke, 1999). For example, UK shoreline management planning since the mid 1990 s has achieved success in reducing the occurrence of “knock on effects. ” It has altered thinking away from the <b>basic</b> <b>provision</b> of defences towards a more holistic management of risks at the coast, setting out clearly locations where protection is likely to be required and others wher...|$|E
