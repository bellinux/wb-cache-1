5|$|The Panic of 1837 and the {{depression}} that followed caused many to blame Van Buren and his Democratic Party {{for the hard}} times, making {{it more likely that}} the Whig nominee in 1840 would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>president.</b> In addition to Harrison and Webster, Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky sought the nomination, as did General Winfield Scott. Some Whigs argued that because {{the depression}} was driving many to their ranks, {{there was no need to}} nominate a relative outsider such as Harrison; the party could win behind one of its statesmen, Clay or Webster, and by 1838, Clay was the frontrunner. A slaveholder, he commanded the near-united support of the South, though this came at the price of alienating many Northern Whigs. There was wide consensus in the party that a national convention was needed to decide on a presidential candidate, and in late 1837, the Whig congressional caucus agreed to work with the state parties to organize a convention. After considerable maneuvering, a convention to nominate candidates for president and vice president was called by the congressional caucus in May 1838, to be held at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania beginning on December 4, 1839. Having failed to gain much support, Webster dropped out of the race in June 1839.|$|E
25|$|Bertrand {{promptly}} {{resigned and}} left the country. The United States ambassador helped arrange the installation of an interim government headed by Francisco Bográn, who promised to hold free elections. However, General López Gutiérrez, who now effectively controlled the military situation, {{made it clear that}} he was determined to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>president.</b> After considerable negotiation and some confusion, a formula was worked out under which elections were held. López Gutiérrez won easily in a manipulated election, and in October 1920 he assumed the presidency.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Obregón {{endorsed}} Plutarco Elías Calles {{for president}} in the 1924 election (in which Obregón was not eligible to run). Finance Minister Adolfo de la Huerta (who had served as interim president in 1920, before stepping aside in favor of Obregón) believed that he deserved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>president</b> and that Obregón was repeating Carranza's mistake of imposing his own candidate on the country. De la Huerta therefore accepted the nomination of the Cooperativist Party to be its candidate in the presidential elections.|$|E

[...] He was amply {{supplied}} with money: business owners had eagerly given, expecting Seward to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>president.</b> Weed's reputation was not entirely positive; he was believed corrupt by some, and his association both helped and hurt Seward.|$|E

500|$|On 16 April 1970, Ahomadégbé and Maga met in {{the town}} of Savé, under French pressure, and agreed to the notion of a single party {{controlling}} government with a rotating presidency. Apithy did not attend the meeting and rejected the proposal, suggesting to the military that they instead pick one of their own to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>president.</b> The military leaders rejected this proposal and endorsed the shared presidency idea. [...] Apithy then {{agreed to participate in the}} Presidential Council. Zinsou, with only 3% of the vote, was ignored in the discussions and left the country for France. Historian Samuel Decalo commented that although coups and crises were regular in the country's short history, [...] "the April 1970 crisis was the most ominous Dahomey had ever faced." ...|$|E

500|$|Over {{a hundred}} books and {{scholarly}} works {{have been written}} about Clinton, from many perspectives. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found [...] "a virtual cottage industry" [...] of [...] "anti-Clinton literature", put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints, with titles such as , Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will <b>Be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Next</b> <b>President</b> of the United States Unless ... Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well (other than the memoirs written by her and her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her. Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable [...] "bogeyman" [...] to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.|$|E
500|$|When the 1839 Whig National Convention {{convened in}} Harrisburg, Pennsylvania {{to choose the}} party's ticket, the United States was {{in the third year}} of a serious {{recession}} following the Panic of 1837. President Van Buren's ineffective efforts to deal with the situation cost him public support. [...] With the Democratic Party torn into factions, the head of the Whig ticket would likely <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>president.</b> Harrison, Clay, and General Winfield Scott all sought the nomination. Tyler attended the convention and was with the Virginia delegation, although he had no official status. Because of bitterness over the unresolved Senate election, the Virginia delegation refused to make Tyler its favorite son candidate for vice president. Tyler himself did nothing to aid his chances. If his favored candidate for the presidential nomination, Clay, were successful, he would likely not be chosen for the second place on the ticket, which would probably go to a Northerner to assure geographic balance.|$|E
500|$|The {{outcome of}} the 1894 {{elections}} made it increasingly likely that a Republican would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>president.</b> At the time, the presidential nominating process started much later than it subsequently would, and McKinley, in quietly organizing his campaign with Hanna's aid {{in the early months}} of 1895, was alone among the candidates in acting so early. Other potential Republican candidates were former president Harrison, incoming Speaker of the House Thomas Brackett Reed of Maine, Iowa Senator William B. Allison, and several state favorite sons, such as Illinois Senator Shelby Cullom. If former president Harrison entered the race, he would immediately become a major contender, and uncertainty over his status hung over the race in 1895. At the time, unless there was an incumbent elected Republican president, the nomination was generally not decided until the convention, with state political bosses and delegates exacting a price for their support. A candidate's efforts to gain the nomination did not begin until shortly before the state delegate conventions in the spring of the election year, where fights over the makeup of the delegation often focused on who would be on it, rather than who delegates would support. McKinley and Hanna decided on a systematic nationwide effort to gain the nomination, employing what onetime presidential adviser Karl Rove—author of a 2015 book on the 1896 race—called [...] "the first modern primary campaign".|$|E

2500|$|Howe {{traveled}} through the American seaboard states, arriving in Boston on April 22, 1808, {{under the guise}} of visiting family and friends. He travelled from Boston to Washington, Norfolk, and New York. He reported on the political situation, predicted that Madison would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>President,</b> stated that there were French emissaries throughout the country, commented on the anti-British sentiment of the Irish in New York, and assessed the state of military preparedness. John Howe made a second trip to the United States from November 10, 1808 to January 5, 1809, but this visit was under the more official guise of [...] "bearer of Dispatches to the British Minister", that minister being David Montagu, Baron Erskine of Restormel Castle, the British Envoy at Washington from 1806 to 1810. This mission included accompanying Baron Erskine to interviews with President Thomas Jefferson and President-elect James Madison. John Howe concluded that war with the United States could be avoided if the British blockade and tariff on ships entering French ports (which was having a devastating effect on the American economy) were rescinded, but if they were not, war was probably unavoidable and attacks on the British North American colonies were likely. When Madison declared war on Britain, beginning the War of 1812, he cited the British Orders in Council which established the blockade and tariff, just as John Howe had predicted, and attacks on the British North American colonies (later Canada) did occur.|$|E

40|$|The Bush-Cheney {{years have}} been marked by a disappointing {{economic}} performance, reflected in a business cycle expansion that is by many measures the weakest since World War II.

Putting a bottom to <b>the</b> slump will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>president's</b> most immediate task. However, there is a deeper question, argues the author.

2500|$|Hannity {{was criticized}} by some conservatives, {{especially}} supporters of Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign, as being overly {{favorable to the}} candidacy of Donald Trump and granting Trump more airtime than other presidential candidates during the 2016 primaries. Hannity, for instance, let Donald Trump promote the false conspiracy theory that Ted Cruz's father {{was involved in the}} John F Kennedy assassination. During interviews, Hannity [...] "frequently cites areas where he agrees with Trump, or where he thinks Trump was right about something, then asks him to expand on it", and [...] "often ignores or defends Trump from criticism," [...] according to a CNN report. Tensions between Cruz and Hannity appeared to reach a boiling point during a contentious April 2016 radio interview, during which Cruz implied Hannity was a [...] "hard-core Donald Trump supporter" [...] and Hannity responded by accusing Cruz of [...] "throw this in my face" [...] every time he asked a [...] "legitimate question". Jim Rutenberg reported in August 2016 that Hannity is [...] "not only Mr. Trump’s biggest media booster; he also veers into the role of adviser," [...] citing sources who said Hannity spent months offering suggestions to Trump and his campaign on strategy and messaging. Hannity responded to the report by saying, [...] "I’m not hiding the fact that I want Donald Trump to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>president</b> of the United States. ... I never claimed to be a journalist." [...] Hannity has feuded with several conservatives who oppose Trump, including National Reviews Jonah Goldberg, Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens, and National Review editor Rich Lowry.|$|E
