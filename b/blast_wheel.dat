50|$|Popular {{methods for}} {{propelling}} shot media include air blast systems and centrifugal blast wheels. In the air blast systems, media are introduced by various methods {{into the path}} of high pressure air and accelerated through a nozzle directed at the part to be peened. The centrifugal <b>blast</b> <b>wheel</b> consists of a high speed paddle wheel. Shot media are introduced {{in the center of the}} spinning wheel and propelled by the centrifugal force by the spinning paddles towards the part by adjusting the media entrance location, effectively timing the release of the media. Other methods include ultrasonic peening, wet peening, and laser peening (which does not use media).|$|E
50|$|In wheel blasting, a {{spinning}} wheel propels the abrasive against an object. It is typically categorized as an airless blasting operation {{because there is}} no propellant (gas or liquid) used. A wheel machine is a high-power, high-efficiency blasting operation with recyclable abrasive (typically steel or stainless steel shot, cut wire, grit, or similarly sized pellets). Specialized wheel blast machines propel plastic abrasive in a cryogenic chamber, and is usually used for deflashing plastic and rubber components. The size of the wheel blast machine, and the number and power of the wheels vary considerably depending on the parts to be blasted {{as well as on the}} expected result and efficiency. The first <b>blast</b> <b>wheel</b> was patented by Wheelabrator in 1932.|$|E

There are overhead monorail systems {{as well as}} reverse-belted models. Workpiece holding equipment includes rotating index tables, loading and unloading robots, and jigs that hold multiple workpieces. For larger workpieces, manipulators to reposition them to expose features to the shot blast stream are available.|$|R

40|$|Abrasive {{blasting}} {{is a large}} {{field and}} a process that has long existed in mechanical manufacturing. The unpredictable nature of the process makes its research in most cases not theoretically calculated. Instead experiments are used to verify various parameters in the design. In this work, no detailed experiments could be performed due. to time and resource constraints. Trainparts Sweden AB in Bollnäs reconditions and manufactures leaf springs for rail vehicles, {{and they want to}} investigate the introduction of abrasive blasting in their production line. The aim is to investigate what kind of abrasive blasting equipment that fit the company's production line. The goal is to develop a concept proposal on a abrasive blasting machine for own manufacturing or facilitating an investment of a market existing machine.   To come up with a concept proposal a simple working model were developed and was followed during the work on the thesis. Market research on existing abrasive blasting machines and literature studies in the affected areas was conducted {{as the basis for the}} work. Thereafter a comparison with respect to cost, efficiency and application of the different parameters in the abrasive blasting process was made.   The result of this work is a <b>wheel</b> <b>blasting</b> machine with four wheels; this is what gives the best results for the products.   Our conclusion is that a <b>wheel</b> <b>blasting</b> machine is the best option from a manufacturing standpoint but because of high purchase price and low production volumes, it may be appropriate to look at other approaches...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCleaning {{technology}} {{is an important}} factor in the field of production technology as well as service and recycling. Blasting with solid carbon dioxide (dry ice blasting – dib) is generally based on compressed air, which is a flexible but energy consuming acceleration method. To improve the mechanical acceleration by rotational <b>wheel</b> <b>blasting,</b> the main removal mechanisms of dib, mechanical and thermal, have been investigated separately. Based on the developed methods both mechanisms can be characterized independently of the target type. The presented results show a promising approach to determine the size of the mechanical removal mechanism's impact force. Obviously it depends primarily on the blasting pressure, one of the main influencing process factors. Cleaning applications – substrate and the adherence of the residues – show different resistance against thermal stress as well as against mechanical impact. Because of this, an overall benchmark independently of the application had to be defined in order to compare the blasting efficiency of both blasting technologies and the results...|$|R
40|$|Cermets {{are unique}} that {{combines}} the characteristic properties of metals and ceramics. These superior properties make cermet a promising material {{for use in}} several aero-engine components, turbo pumps, heat exchangers, fusion reactors, armour plates, wear resistant components as <b>blast</b> nozzles and <b>wheels</b> dressing tools, seal rings, valve components and bearings, oxidation resistant material as refractory lining, coating to protect materials from corrosive environments and combustion engines. SiC-B 4 C based cermets are being developed as remarkable engineering materials for their outstanding physical and mechanical properties, including high hardness, lightweight, high wear resistance, high melting point, oxidation resistance and great resistance to chemical attack. Fabrication of highly dense SiC-B 4 C based ceramic composite is quite difficult due to its high melting point and strong covalent bond. Properties of these materials can be improved by reducing initial particle size of powders and incorporation of metallic elements into ceramic matrix. The fine and disordered structure produced by mechanical milling increases the molecular diffusion channel during sintering and enhance the densification. Incorporation of Si and Al into SiC-B 4 C ceramic matrix improves the properties since it acts as a binder, enhances densification, and lowers the sintering temperature. In the present study, SiC-B 4 C (60 : 40 wt. ...|$|R
