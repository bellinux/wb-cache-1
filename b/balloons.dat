5|$|A {{technical}} director worked out {{that to make}} Carl's house fly, he would require 23million <b>balloons,</b> but Docter realized that number made the <b>balloons</b> look like small dots. Instead, the <b>balloons</b> created were made to be twice Carl's size. There are 10,927balloons for shots of the house just flying, 20,622balloons for the lift-off sequence, and a varying number in other scenes.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Gifu {{also served}} as the base for the {{creation}} of Japan's fire <b>balloons.</b> These paper-based, bomb-carrying hot air <b>balloons</b> were used in a failed attempt to cause havoc on American soil. Local high school girls made these fire <b>balloons</b> out of Mino washi (a thin but strong Japanese paper) and konnyaku paste. Originally, rubberized silk was used to help these bombs use the newly discovered jet stream to traverse the Pacific Ocean, but Gifu's paper was found to be both stronger, lighter, and more airtight.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1995, three gas <b>balloons</b> {{participating}} in the race entered Belarusian air space. Despite the fact that competition organizers had informed the Belarusian Government about the race in May and that flight plans had been filed, a Mil Mi-24B attack helicopter of the Belarusian Air Force shot down one balloon, killing two American citizens, Alan Fraenckel and John Stuart-Jervis. Another of the <b>balloons</b> was forced to land while the third landed safely over two hours after the initial downing. The crews of the two <b>balloons</b> were fined for entering Belarus without a visa and released. Belarus has neither apologized nor offered compensation for the deaths.|$|E

50|$|<b>Balloon</b> mail is the {{transport}} of mail (usually for weight reasons {{in the form of}} a postcard) carrying the name of the sender by means of an unguided hydrogen or helium filled <b>balloon.</b> Since the <b>balloon</b> is not controllable, the delivery of a <b>balloon</b> mail is left to good fortune; often the <b>balloon</b> and postcard are lost. A found <b>balloon</b> should be returned to the sender (by conventional post) with an indication of the discovery site, so that the sender can determine how far their <b>balloon</b> flew. Frequently <b>balloon</b> mail is sent as part of a <b>balloon</b> competition.|$|R

5|$|Andrée gave a glowingly optimistic {{account of}} {{the ease with which}} these {{requirements}} could be met. Larger <b>balloons</b> had been constructed in France, he claimed, and more airtight, too. Some French <b>balloons</b> had remained hydrogen-filled for over a year without appreciable loss of buoyancy. As for the hydrogen, filling the balloon at the launch site could easily be done with the help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units; for the steering he referred to his own drag-rope experiments with the Svea, stating that a deviation of 27degrees from the wind direction could be routinely achieved.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas <b>balloons</b> and was the only producer in the United States of these <b>balloons</b> for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large <b>balloons.</b> The fabric material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|E

50|$|<b>Balloon</b> {{catheters}} used in angioplasty {{are either}} of Over-the-Wire(OTW) or Rapid Exchange(Rx) design. Rx catheters nowadays are about 90% of the Coronary Intervention market. While OTW Catheters {{may still be}} useful in highly tortuous vascular pathways, they sacrifice deflation time and pushability. When a <b>balloon</b> catheter is used to compress plaque within a clogged coronary artery it {{is referred to as}} a plain old <b>balloon</b> angioplasty or POBA. <b>Balloon</b> catheters are also utilized in the deployment of stents during angioplasty. <b>Balloon</b> catheters are supplied to the cath lab with a stent premounted on the <b>balloon.</b> When the cardiologist inflates the <b>balloon</b> it expands the stent. When the cardiologist subsequently deflates the <b>balloon</b> the stent stays behind in the artery and the <b>balloon</b> catheter can be removed. Stents that are used in conjunction with a <b>balloon</b> catheter are known as <b>balloon</b> expandable stents.|$|R
50|$|A {{different}} approach for high altitude <b>ballooning,</b> especially used for long duration flights is the superpressure <b>balloon.</b> A superpressure <b>balloon</b> maintains a higher pressure inside the <b>balloon</b> than the external (ambient) pressure.|$|R
50|$|The first {{tethered}} manned <b>balloon</b> {{flight was}} by a larger Montgolfier <b>balloon,</b> probably on 15 October 1783. The first free <b>balloon</b> flight {{was by the}} same Montgolfier <b>balloon</b> on 21 November 1783.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} {{gradually}} map the area the Allies {{were obliged to}} resort to mangrullos (improvised watch towers) or (a first in South American warfare) captive observation <b>balloons,</b> but the Paraguayans obscured the terrain by lighting fires of damp grass.|$|E
5|$|Myers made eleven {{hydrogen}} <b>balloons</b> for the Navy for Admiral Francis J. Higginson in 1902 for {{a military}} exercise. Ten of the <b>balloons</b> were six feet in diameter and used for signaling purposes that troops were nearby. The eleventh balloon of 12,000 cubic feet capacity was twenty-eight-feet in diameter. It was capable of carrying two men and all their associated observation equipment. It {{was used by the}} Signal Corps for a high altitude observation platform to monitor enemy warships. This balloon was tethered to and controlled by a Navy ship. The intelligence gleaned about the enemy and its possible intentions could be passed on to the Army.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Kart {{also has}} three {{multiplayer}} modes; Mario Kart GP, Match Race and Battle Mode. The multiplayer modes support two {{players and the}} second player uses {{the bottom half of}} the screen which is used as a map in the single player modes. Mario Kart GP is the same as in single player, the only difference being that there are now two human controlled and six computer-controlled drivers. Match Race involves the two players going head to head on a track of their choice without any opponents. In Battle Mode, the two players again go head to head, but this time in one of four dedicated Battle Mode courses. Each player starts with three <b>balloons</b> around their kart which can be popped by power-ups fired by the other player. The first player to have all three of their <b>balloons</b> popped loses.|$|E
50|$|In 1909, the <b>Balloon</b> Factory was {{separated}} from the <b>Balloon</b> School.

Several months later Major Sir Alexander Bannerman took over the <b>Balloon</b> School from Colonel Capper.|$|R
30|$|A {{three-way}} stopcock {{was connected}} to the <b>balloon</b> lumen of the catheter. Mechanical ventilation was not terminated during <b>balloon</b> manipulation to mimic an actual clinical scenario. The <b>balloon</b> was first deflated by generating a negative pressure, followed by opening the <b>balloon</b> to the atmosphere for 3  min to standardize the residual volume remaining in the <b>balloon</b> and the catheter lumen. The <b>balloon</b> was then progressively inflated in 0.5 -ml increments to a volume that resulted in a deviation in the <b>balloon</b> pressure from the chamber pressure that exceeded 1  cmH 2 O. <b>Balloon</b> inflation was performed at end-expiration. At each tested <b>balloon</b> volume, after 3 -min equilibration period, end-expiratory and end-inspiratory occlusion was performed (each for 10  s), and <b>balloon</b> pressure and chamber pressure were simultaneously measured during the last second.|$|R

5|$|The game is {{composed}} of six worlds with three levels each, totalling to 18 main levels. The objective of the main levels in each world is to collect four jet pods. Each final level of a world consists of a boss fight. The level designs vary from snow-capped mountains to carnivals. While most of the levels are large, outdoor excursions, two are enclosed within a narrow interior. The game features hidden bonus levels, which are triggered when secret entrances are found. Bonus levels consist of blocks with <b>balloons</b> in them; popping the <b>balloons</b> yields either coins or power-ups. A time attack mode is available for any level the player has completed.|$|E
5|$|When {{the film}} {{screened}} at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California from May 29 to July 23, 2009, it {{was accompanied by}} Lighten Up!, a live show featuring Disney characters. Other tie-ins included children's books such as My Name is Dug, illustrated by screenwriter Ronnie del Carmen. Despite Pixar's track record, Target Corporation and Walmart stocked few Up items, while Pixar's regular collaborator Thinkway Toys did not produce merchandise, claiming its story is unusual and {{would be hard to}} promote. Disney acknowledged not every Pixar film would have to become a franchise. Promotional partners include Aflac, NASCAR, and Airship Ventures, while Cluster <b>Balloons</b> promoted the film with a replica of Carl's couch lifted by hot air <b>balloons</b> for journalists to sit in.|$|E
