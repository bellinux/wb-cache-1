5|$|Neptunocene, Np(C8H8)2, was {{synthesized}} in 1970 by reacting neptunium(IV) chloride with K2(C8H8). It is isomorphous to uranocene and plutonocene, {{and they}} behave chemically identically: all three compounds are insensitive to water or dilute bases but {{are sensitive to}} air, reacting quickly to form oxides, and are only slightly soluble in benzene and toluene. Other known neptunium cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives include Np(RC8H7)2 (R = ethanol, <b>butanol)</b> and KNp(C8H8)·2THF, which is isostructural to the corresponding plutonium compound. In addition, neptunium hydrocarbyls have been prepared, and solvated triiodide complexes of neptunium are a precursor to many organoneptunium and inorganic neptunium compounds.|$|E
25|$|In late 2012, a new {{discovery}} {{made the}} alternative fuel <b>butanol</b> {{more attractive to}} the biofuel industry. Scientist Hao Feng found a method that could significantly {{reduce the cost of}} the energy involved in making <b>butanol.</b> His team was able to isolate the <b>butanol</b> molecules during the fermentation process so they do not kill the organisms, and produces 100% or more <b>butanol.</b> After the fermentation process, they used a process called cloud point separation to recover the <b>butanol</b> which used 4 times less energy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Butanol</b> {{is one of}} many side {{products}} {{produced from}} current fermentation technologies; as a consequence, current fermentation technologies allow for very low yields of pure extracted <b>butanol.</b> When compared to ethanol, <b>butanol</b> is more fuel efficient as a fuel alternative, but ethanol can be produced at a much lower cost and with much greater yields.|$|E
25|$|The Swiss company Butalco GmbH uses {{a special}} {{technology}} to modify yeasts {{in order to}} produce <b>butanol</b> instead of ethanol. Yeasts as production organisms for <b>butanol</b> have decisive advantages compared to bacteria.|$|E
25|$|<b>Butanol</b> better tolerates water {{contamination}} and is less corrosive than ethanol and {{more suitable for}} distribution through existing pipelines for gasoline. In blends with diesel or gasoline, <b>butanol</b> {{is less likely to}} separate from this fuel than ethanol if the fuel is contaminated with water. There is also a vapor pressure co-blend synergy with <b>butanol</b> and gasoline containing ethanol, which facilitates ethanol blending. This facilitates storage and distribution of blended fuels.|$|E
25|$|Although biofuel {{demand has}} risen to over one billion liters (about 260 million US gallons) yearly, {{fermentation}} remains a largely inefficient method of <b>butanol</b> production. Under normal living conditions, Clostridium bacterial communities have a low yield of <b>butanol</b> per gram of glucose. Obtaining higher yields of <b>butanol</b> involves manipulation of the metabolic networks within bacteria to prioritize the synthesis of the biofuel. Metabolic engineering and genetic engineering tools allow scientists to alter the states of reactions occurring in the organism, utilizing advanced techniques to create a bacterial strain capable of high <b>butanol</b> yield. Optimization can also be accomplished by the transfer of specific genetic information to other uni-cellular species, capitalizing on the traits of multiple organisms to achieve {{the highest rate of}} alcohol production.|$|E
25|$|However, if {{ordinary}} Saccharomyces yeast can {{be modified}} to improve its ethanol resistance, scientists may yet one day produce a strain of the Weizmann organism with a <b>butanol</b> resistance higher than the natural boundary of 7%. This would be useful because <b>butanol</b> has a higher energy density than ethanol, and because waste fibre left over from sugar crops used to make ethanol could be made into <b>butanol,</b> raising the alcohol yield of fuel crops without there being {{a need for more}} crops to be planted.|$|E
25|$|Also in late 2012, using systems {{metabolic}} engineering, a Korean {{research team}} at the former Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has succeeded in demonstrating an optimized process to increase <b>butanol</b> production by generating an engineered bacterium. Professor Sang Yup Lee at the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, KAIST, Dr. Do Young Seung at GS Caltex, a large oil refining company in Korea, and Dr. Yu-Sin Jang at BioFuelChem, a startup <b>butanol</b> company in Korea, applied a systems metabolic engineering approach to improve the production of <b>butanol</b> through enhancing the performance of Clostridium acetobutylicum, {{one of the best}} known butanol-producing bacteria. In addition, the downstream process was optimized and an in situ recovery process was integrated to achieve higher <b>butanol</b> titer, yield, and productivity. The combination of systems metabolic engineering and bioprocess optimization resulted {{in the development of a}} process capable of producing more than 585g of <b>butanol</b> from 1.8kg of glucose, which allows the production of this important industrial solvent and advanced biofuel to be cost competitive.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic {{engineering}} {{can be used}} {{to allow}} an organism to use a cheaper substrate such as glycerol instead of glucose. Because fermentation processes require glucose derived from foods, <b>butanol</b> production can negatively impact food supply (see food vs fuel debate). Glycerol is a good alternative source for <b>butanol</b> production. While glucose sources are valuable and limited, glycerol is abundant and has a low market price because it is a waste product of biodiesel production. <b>Butanol</b> production from glycerol is economically viable using metabolic pathways that exist in Clostridium pasteurianum bacterium.|$|E
25|$|The {{viscosity}} of alcohols {{increase with}} longer carbon chains. For this reason, <b>butanol</b> {{is used as}} an alternative to shorter alcohols when a more viscous solvent is desired. The kinematic viscosity of <b>butanol</b> is several times higher than that of gasoline and about as viscous as high quality diesel fuel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Butanol</b> {{may be used}} as a fuel in an {{internal}} combustion engine. Because its longer hydrocarbon chain causes it to be fairly non-polar, it is more similar to gasoline than it is to ethanol. <b>Butanol</b> has been demonstrated to work in vehicles designed for use with gasoline without modification. It has a four link hydrocarbon chain.|$|E
25|$|The fuel in {{an engine}} {{has to be}} vaporized before it will burn. Insufficient {{vaporization}} is a known problem with alcohol fuels during cold starts in cold weather. As the heat of vaporization of <b>butanol</b> {{is less than half}} of that of ethanol, an engine running on <b>butanol</b> should be easier to start in cold weather than one running on ethanol or methanol.|$|E
25|$|The gels {{typically}} {{consist of}} acrylamide, bisacrylamide, the optional denaturant (SDS or urea), and a buffer with an adjusted pH. The solution may be degassed under a vacuum {{to prevent the}} formation of air bubbles during polymerization. Alternatively, <b>butanol</b> may {{be added to the}} resolving gel (for proteins) after it is poured, as <b>butanol</b> removes bubbles and makes the surface smooth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Butanol</b> from biomass {{is called}} biobutanol. It {{can be used}} in unmodified {{gasoline}} engines.|$|E
25|$|Switching a {{gasoline}} engine over to <b>butanol</b> would in theory {{result in a}} fuel consumption penalty of about10% but butanol's effect on mileage {{is yet to be}} determined by a scientific study. While the energy density for any mixture of gasoline and <b>butanol</b> can be calculated, tests with other alcohol fuels have demonstrated that the effect on fuel economy is not proportional to the change in energy density.|$|E
25|$|While ethanol and {{methanol}} {{have lower}} energy densities than <b>butanol,</b> their higher octane number allows for greater compression ratio and efficiency.|$|E
25|$|David Ramey {{drove from}} Blacklick, Ohio to San Diego, California using 100% <b>butanol</b> in an unmodified 1992 Buick Park Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Propanol and <b>butanol</b> are {{considerably}} less toxic and less volatile than methanol. In particular, <b>butanol</b> {{has a high}} flash point of 35°C, which is a benefit for fire safety, but may be a difficulty for starting engines in cold weather. The concept of flash point is however not directly applicable to engines as the compression of {{the air in the}} cylinder means that the temperature is several hundred degrees Celsius before ignition takes place.|$|E
25|$|The {{fermentation}} {{processes to}} produce propanol and <b>butanol</b> from cellulose are fairly tricky to execute, and the Weizmann organism (Clostridium acetobutylicum) currently used to perform these conversions produces an extremely unpleasant smell, and {{this must be}} taken into consideration when designing and locating a fermentation plant. This organism also dies when the <b>butanol</b> content of whatever it is fermenting rises to 7%. For comparison, yeast dies when the ethanol content of its feedstock hits 14%. Specialized strains can tolerate even greater ethanol concentrations - so-called turbo yeast can withstand up to 16% ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Consumer {{acceptance}} may {{be limited}} due to the potentially offensive banana-like smell of n-butanol. Plans are underway to market a fuel that is 85% Ethanol and 15% <b>Butanol</b> (E85B), so existing E85 internal combustion engines can run on a 100% renewable fuel {{that could be made}} without using any fossil fuels. Because its longer hydrocarbon chain causes it to be fairly non-polar, it is more similar to gasoline than it is to ethanol. <b>Butanol</b> has been demonstrated to work in vehicles designed for use with gasoline without modification.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, <b>butanol</b> {{production}} from biomass and agricultural byproducts {{could be more}} efficient (i.e. unit engine motive power delivered per unit solar energy consumed) than ethanol or methanol production.|$|E
25|$|Energy Environment International {{developed}} {{a method for}} producing <b>butanol</b> from biomass, which {{involves the use of}} two separate micro-organisms in sequence to minimize production of acetone and ethanol byproducts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Butanol</b> is toxic {{at a rate}} of 20g {{per liter}} and may need to undergo Tier 1 and Tier 2 health effects testing before being {{permitted}} as a primary fuel by the EPA.|$|E
25|$|Some {{well-known}} {{alternative fuels}} include biodiesel, bioalcohol (methanol, ethanol, <b>butanol),</b> refuse-derived fuel, chemically stored electricity (batteries and fuel cells), hydrogen, non-fossil methane, non-fossil natural gas, vegetable oil, propane and other biomass sources.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol fuels, {{including}} <b>butanol</b> and ethanol, are partially oxidized {{and therefore}} {{need to run}} at richer mixtures than gasoline. Standard gasoline engines in cars can adjust the air-fuel ratio to accommodate variations in the fuel, but only within certain limits depending on model. If the limit is exceeded by running the engine on pure ethanol or a gasoline blend with {{a high percentage of}} ethanol, the engine will run lean, something which can critically damage components. Compared to ethanol, <b>butanol</b> can be mixed in higher ratios with gasoline for use in existing cars without the need for retrofit as the air-fuel ratio and energy content are closer to that of gasoline.|$|E
25|$|DuPont and BP {{plan to make}} {{biobutanol}} {{the first}} product of their joint effort to develop, produce, and market next-generation biofuels. In Europe the Swiss company Butalco is developing genetically modified yeasts {{for the production of}} biobutanol from cellulosic materials. Gourmet <b>Butanol,</b> a United States-based company, is developing a process that utilizes fungi to convert organic waste into biobutanol.|$|E
25|$|Biologically {{produced}} alcohols, {{most commonly}} ethanol, and less commonly propanol and <b>butanol,</b> {{are produced by}} the action of microorganisms and enzymes through the fermentation of sugars or starches (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult). Biobutanol (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol fuels {{have less}} energy per unit weight and unit volume than gasoline. To make it {{possible}} to compare the net energy released per cycle a measure called the fuels specific energy is sometimes used. It is defined as the energy released per air fuel ratio. The net energy released per cycle is higher for <b>butanol</b> than ethanol or methanol and about 10% higher than for gasoline.|$|E
25|$|The 3-carbon alcohol, {{propanol}} (C3H7OH), is {{not often}} used as a direct fuel source for petrol engines(unlike ethanol, methanol and <b>butanol),</b> with most being directed into use as a solvent. However, it {{is used as a}} source of hydrogen in some types of fuel cell; it can generate a higher voltage than methanol, which is the fuel of choice for most alcohol-based fuel cells. However, since propanol is harder to produce than methanol (biologically OR from oil), methanol-utilising fuel cells are preferred over those that utilise propanol.|$|E
25|$|Microbial {{gastrointestinal}} flora in {{a variety}} of animals have shown potential for the production of biofuels. Recent research has shown that TU-103, a strain of Clostridium bacteria found in Zebra feces, can convert nearly any form of cellulose into <b>butanol</b> fuel. Microbes in panda waste are being investigated for their use in creating biofuels from bamboo and other plant materials. There has also been substantial research into the technology of using the gut microbiomes of wood-feeding insects for the conversion of lignocellulotic material into biofuel.|$|E
25|$|The undigested residue {{from the}} {{fermentation}} {{may be used}} in gasification to make hydrogen (H2). This H2 can then be used to hydrogenolyze the esters over a catalyst (e.g., copper chromite), which are produced by esterifying either the ammonium carboxylate salts (e.g., ammonium acetate, propionate, butyrate) or the carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid) with a high-molecular-weight alcohol (e.g., hexanol, heptanol). From the hydrogenolysis, the final products are the high-molecular-weight alcohol, which is recycled back to the esterification, and the corresponding primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, <b>butanol).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{measurement}} of brain uptake of acetamide, antipyrine, benzyl alcohol, <b>butanol,</b> caffeine, cytosine, phenytoin, ethanol, ethylene glycol, heroin, mannitol, methanol, phenobarbital, propylene glycol, thiourea, and urea in ether-anesthetized newborn vs. adult rabbits shows that newborn rabbit and adult rabbit brain endothelia are functionally similar {{with respect to}} lipid-mediated permeability. These data confirmed that no differences in permeability could be detected between newborn and adult BBB capillaries. No difference in brain uptake of glucose, amino acids, organic acids, purines, nucleosides, or choline was observed between adult and newborn rabbits. These experiments indicate that the newborn BBB has restrictive properties {{similar to that of}} the adult. In contrast to suggestions of an immature barrier in young animals, these studies indicate that a sophisticated, selective BBB is operative at birth.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 {{researchers}} {{developed a}} method for storing electrical energy as chemical energy in higher alcohols (including <b>butanol).</b> These alcohols can then be used as liquid transportation fuels. The team led by James C. Liao genetically engineered lithoautotrophic microorganism known as Ralstonia Eutropha H16 to produce isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol in an electro-bioreactor. Carbon dioxide is the sole carbon source for this process and electricity is used as the energetic component. The process they developed effectively separates the light and dark reactions that occur during photosynthesis. Solar panels are used to convert sunlight to electrical energy which is then converted using the microorganism to a chemical intermediate. The team {{is now in the}} process of scaling up the operation and believes this process will be more efficient than the biologic process.|$|E
25|$|Fuel {{dispensers}} {{are used}} to pump petrol/gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas, CGH2, HCNG, LPG, liquid hydrogen, kerosene, alcohol fuel (like methanol, ethanol, <b>butanol,</b> propanol), biofuels (like straight vegetable oil, biodiesel), or other types of fuel into the tanks within vehicles and calculate the financial cost of the fuel transferred to the vehicle. Fuel dispensers are also known as bowsers (in some parts of Australia), petrol pumps (in most Commonwealth countries) or gas pumps (in North America). Besides fuel dispensers, one other significant device which {{is also found in}} filling stations and can refuel certain (compressed-air) vehicles is an air compressor, although generally these are just used to inflate car tyres. Also, many filling stations incorporate a convenience store, which like most other buildings generally have electricity sockets; hence plug-in electric vehicles can be recharged.|$|E
25|$|A {{study done}} by Ethan I. Lan and James C. Liao {{attempted}} {{to utilize the}} ATP produced during photosynthesis in blue-green algae to work around the thermodynamically unfavorable acetyl-CoA condensation to acetoacetyl-CoA. The native system was re-engineered to have acetyl-CoA react with ATP and CO2 to form an intermediate, malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA then reacts with another acetyl-CoA to form the desired acetoacetyl-CoA. The energy release from ATP hydrolysis (dG = -7.3 kcal/mol) makes this pathway significantly more favorable than standard condensation. Because blue-green algae generate NADPH during photosynthesis, it can be assumed that the cofactor environment is NADPH rich. Therefore, the native reaction pathway was further engineered to use NADPH rather than the standard NADH. All of these adjustments led to a 4-fold increase in <b>butanol</b> production, showing the importance of ATP and cofactor driving forces as a design principle in pathway engineering.|$|E
25|$|Olfactory memory deficits can be {{significant}} indicators of brain damage and pathology. There is {{evidence to suggest}} that certain mental disorders not only produce olfactory deficits but also predict them. Evidence has been found for a number of disorders, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, alcoholic Korsakoff's syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. In animal research certain brain altering drugs such as anti-depressants produce deficits in olfactory memory. In testing the effects of anti-depressants on olfactory sensitivity in mice, the “mice were tested in a Y-maze with a choice between an odorant (<b>butanol)</b> or distilled water before and during 3 weeks of dailyintra-peritoneal injection of either citalopram or clomipramine. Their performance was compared with those of a control group injected with a saline solution” and the results were that significant olfactory deficits were found during the three-week period of testing.|$|E
