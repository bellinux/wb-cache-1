40|$|Recently work on {{technological}} change has {{emphasized the importance}} and implications of different knowledge bases among industries in terms of innovative potential. In some industries, products and processes have become more complex, as well as {{there appears to be}} increased convergence in some market segments. Although increasing attention has been given to features of knowledge bases, there have been limited empirical research on how to measure them. In this paper a method is proposed to measure empirically the <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> dimensions <b>of</b> main technology fields, sectors and firms in the economy. For this purpose, we measure the knowledge bases of 30 main technology fields by using the concepts <b>of</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> <b>depth.</b> <b>Breadth</b> corresponds to the range of different subjects that a technology field draws upon. Depth refers {{to the extent to which}} a certain field is exploited in detail. We position the main technology fields in the <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> space by utilizing the EPO (European Patent Office) database between 1978 - 2000. We also present the evolution <b>of</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> through time, as well as the <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> dimensions <b>of</b> 40 largest firms in biotechnology and telecommunications. Our results reveal that the both technology fields and firms are largely scattered in the <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> space. Biotechnology stands out to have the highest <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> <b>depth.</b> Patents, <b>Breadth</b> <b>and</b> <b>depth,</b> technology fields, knowledge base. ...|$|R

[...] Also in 1968, inspired at a dinner party she attended with Baldwin, cartoonist Jules Feiffer, and his wife Judy, and challenged by Random House editor Robert Loomis, she wrote her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, published in 1969, which brought her international recognition and acclaim.|$|E
