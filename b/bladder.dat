5|$|A {{predisposition}} for <b>bladder</b> infections may run in families. Other {{risk factors}} include diabetes, being uncircumcised, {{and having a}} large prostate. In children UTIs are associated with vesicoureteral reflux (an abnormal movement of urine from the <b>bladder</b> into ureters or kidneys) and constipation.|$|E
5|$|The {{bacteria}} that cause urinary tract infections typically enter the <b>bladder</b> via the urethra. However, infection may also occur via the blood or lymph. It {{is believed that}} the bacteria are usually transmitted to the urethra from the bowel, with females at greater risk due to their anatomy. After gaining entry to the <b>bladder,</b> E. Coli are able to attach to the <b>bladder</b> wall and form a biofilm that resists the body's immune response.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a swim <b>bladder</b> that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim <b>bladder</b> is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel. In fish where the swim <b>bladder</b> is closed, the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim <b>bladder</b> and the blood. The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim <b>bladder,</b> but this appears to have evolved separately: other Actinopterygii such as the bowfin and the bichir do not have one, so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost swim <b>bladder</b> is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E

60|$|The Uses of {{the several}} Parts.--After the above long but {{necessary}} description of the parts, we will turn to their uses. The <b>bladders</b> have been supposed by some authors to serve as floats; but branches which bore no <b>bladders,</b> and others from {{which they had been}} removed, floated perfectly, owing to the air in the intercellular spaces. <b>Bladders</b> containing dead and captured animals usually include bubbles of air, but these cannot have been generated solely by the process of decay, as I have often seen air in young, clean, and empty bladders; and some old <b>bladders</b> with much decaying matter had no bubbles.|$|R
5|$|To attract mates, some teleosts produce sounds, {{either by}} stridulation or by {{vibrating}} the swim <b>bladder.</b> In the Sciaenidae, the muscles that {{attached to the}} swim blabber cause it to oscillate rapidly, creating drumming sounds. Marine catfishes, sea horses and grunts stridulate by rubbing together skeletal parts, teeth or spines. In these fish, the swim <b>bladder</b> may act as a resonator. Stridulation sounds are predominantly from 1000–4000 Hz, though sounds modified by the swim <b>bladder</b> have frequencies lower than 1000Hz.|$|E
5|$|A {{concern for}} sexual {{activity}} that is not dangerous but that can be upsetting for both partners is <b>bladder</b> or bowel leakage due to urinary or fecal incontinence. Couples can prepare for sex by draining the <b>bladder</b> using intermittent catheterization or placing towels down in advance. People with indwelling urinary catheters must take special care with them, removing them or taping {{them out of the}} way.|$|E

40|$|A first {{space vehicle}} is {{attached}} {{with a second}} space vehicle which includes a rocket propulsion nozzle having a combustion chamber upstream from the nozzle throat. Apparatus 10 includes an elongate grappling arm 12 extending from the first space vehicle, a pair of inflatable <b>bladders</b> 16, 18 positioned about the grappling arm for engaging an inner surface of the combustion chamber upon inflation. {{and a pair of}} rear <b>bladders</b> 20, 22 positioned about the grappling arm for engaging an inner surface of the nozzle downstream from the combustion chamber upon inflation for aligning the grappling arm and the rocket propulsion nozzle. A pressurized fluid source 24 is provided on the first space vehicle for supplying fluid pressure to the inflatable <b>bladders.</b> and a fluid control valve manifold 30 selectively controls the release of pressurized fluid to the <b>bladders.</b> According to the method of the invention. the grappling arm is inserted into the rocket propulsion nozzle. and the control valves are actuated to first inflate the front <b>bladders</b> and thereby interconnect the grappling arm and the rocket propulsion nozzle. The rear <b>bladders</b> are subsequently inflated to align a central axis of the grappling arm with a central axis of the rocket propulsion nozzle. Inflation of the rear <b>bladders</b> provides an axial reaction load to balance the axial load provided by the front <b>bladders.</b> Attaching the vehicles in space may be controlled from the earth by activating the control valves to inflate the <b>bladders.</b> The cost of attaching space vehicles is significantly reduced by attaching a grappling arm on one vehicle with the existing rocket propulsion nozzle of another vehicle...|$|R
60|$|The {{real use}} of the <b>bladders</b> is to capture small aquatic animals, and this they do on a large scale. In the first lot of plants, which I {{received}} from the New Forest early in July, {{a large proportion of}} the fully [page 405] grown <b>bladders</b> contained prey; in a second lot, received in the beginning of August, most of the <b>bladders</b> were empty, but plants had been selected which had grown in unusually pure water. In the first lot, my son examined seventeen <b>bladders,</b> including prey of some kind, and eight of these contained entomostracan crustaceans, three larvae of insects, one being still alive, and six remnants of animals so much decayed that their nature could not be distinguished. I picked out five <b>bladders</b> which seemed very full, and found in them four, five, eight, and ten crustaceans, and in the fifth a single much elongated larva. In five other <b>bladders,</b> selected from containing remains, but not appearing very full, there were one, two, four, two, and five crustaceans. A plant of Utricularia vulgaris, which had been kept in almost pure water, was placed by Cohn one evening into water swarming with crustaceans, and by the next morning most of the <b>bladders</b> contained these animals entrapped and swimming round and round their prisons. They remained alive for several days; but at last perished, asphyxiated, as I suppose, by the oxygen in the water having been all consumed. Freshwater worms were also found by Cohn in some <b>bladders.</b> In all cases the <b>bladders</b> with decayed remains swarmed with living Algae of many kinds, Infusoria, and other low organisms, which evidently lived as intruders.|$|R

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and <b>bladder</b> function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and <b>bladder,</b> including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the <b>bladder</b> to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} <b>bladder</b> infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty <b>bladder.</b> Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Hybrids of Utricularia nelumbifolia × U. reniformis (and vice versa) were raised, and the <b>bladders</b> {{of adult}} {{individuals}} {{taken out of}} the soil were observed.

Therefore, the morphology of the <b>bladders</b> does not support the hypothesis of a hybrid origin of U. cornigera...|$|R
50|$|The {{cartilaginous}} fish (e.g., {{sharks and}} rays) split {{from the other}} fishes about 420 million years ago, and lack both lungs and swim <b>bladders,</b> suggesting that these structures evolved after that split. Correspondingly, these fish also have both heterocercal and pectoral fins which provide the necessary lift needed {{due to the lack}} of swim <b>bladders.</b> Teleost fish with swim <b>bladders</b> have neutral buoyancy, and have no need for this lift.|$|R

5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by {{blood in the}} urine, can occur secondary {{to a number of}} causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the <b>bladder</b> wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a <b>bladder</b> infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
5|$|The lung/swim <b>bladder</b> {{originated}} as {{an outgrowth}} of the gut, forming a gas-filled <b>bladder</b> above the digestive system. In its primitive form, the air <b>bladder</b> was open to the alimentary canal, a condition called physostome and still found in many fish. The primary function is not entirely certain. One consideration is buoyancy. The heavy scale armour of the early bony fishes would certainly weigh the animals down. In cartilaginous fishes, lacking a swim <b>bladder,</b> the open sea sharks need to swim constantly to avoid sinking into the depths, the pectoral fins providing lift. Another factor is oxygen consumption. Ambient oxygen was relatively low in the early Devonian, possibly about half of modern values. Per unit volume, there is much more oxygen in air than in water, and vertebrates are active animals with a high energy requirement compared to invertebrates of similar sizes. The Devonian saw increasing oxygen levels which opened up new ecological niches by allowing groups able to exploit the additional oxygen to develop into active, large-bodied animals. Particularly in tropical swampland habitats, atmospheric oxygen is much more stable, and may have prompted a reliance of lungs rather than gills for primary oxygen uptake. In the end, both buoyancy and breathing may have been important, and some modern physostome fishes do indeed use their bladders for both.|$|E

The processes within the <b>bladders</b> are quadrifid, with the four diverging arms of equal length. The prey which they had captured consisted of entomostracan crustaceans.|$|R

50|$|Lungs {{originated}} as {{an extra}} pair of pouches in the throat, behind the gill pouches. They were probably present in the last common ancestor of bony fishes.

Lungs and swim <b>bladders</b> are homologous (descended from a common ancestral form) {{as is the case}} for the pulmonary artery (which delivers de-oxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs) and the arteries that supply swim <b>bladders.</b> Air was introduced into the lungs by a process known as buccal pumping.|$|R

25|$|Frequent {{urination}} can be due {{to excessive}} urine production, small <b>bladder</b> capacity, irritability or incomplete emptying. Males with an enlarged prostate urinate more frequently. One definition of an overactive <b>bladder</b> is when a person urinates more than eight times per day. An overactive <b>bladder</b> can often cause urinary incontinence. Though both urinary frequency and volumes {{have been shown to}} have a circadian rhythm, meaning day and night cycles, it is not entirely clear how these are disturbed in the overactive <b>bladder.</b> Urodynamic testing can help to explain the symptoms. An underactive <b>bladder</b> is the condition where there is a difficulty in passing urine and is the main symptom of a neurogenic <b>bladder.</b> Frequent urination at night may indicate the presence of <b>bladder</b> stones.|$|E

500|$|The lungs of today's {{terrestrial}} vertebrates {{and the gas}} <b>bladders</b> of today's {{fish are}} believed to have evolved from simple sacs, as outpocketings of the esophagus, that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions.

In most of the ray-finned fish the sacs evolved into closed off gas <b>bladders,</b> while a number of carp, trout, herring, catfish, and eels have retained the physostome condition with the sack being open to the esophagus. In more basal bony fish, such as the gar, bichir, bowfin and the lobe-finned fish, the <b>bladders</b> have evolved to primarily function as lungs. The lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based tetrapods. Thus, the lungs of vertebrates are homologous to the gas <b>bladders</b> of fish (but not to their gills).|$|R
