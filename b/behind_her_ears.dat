6000|$|... "Now, then, {{come with}} me into the study, Maggie," [...] said Tom, as their father drove away. [...] "What do you shake and toss your head now for, you silly?" [...] he continued; for though her hair was now under a new dispensation, and was brushed {{smoothly}} <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> she seemed still in imagination to be tossing {{it out of her}} eyes. [...] "It makes you look as if you were crazy." ...|$|E

They said you wouldn't let anybody see you--and I determined I would. That's all!" [...] She stopped, threw back her tangled curls <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> shook the briers and thorns from her skirt, and added: [...] "Well, I reckon you aren't afraid of a woman, are you? So no harm's done. Good-by!" ...|$|E

She began to read with full confidence in her own powers, but presently, becoming quite bewildered, her face flushed with irritation. It was unavoidable; she must confess her incompetency, and she was not fond of humiliation.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Nobody,' said Zillah, 'ever {{approached}} her door, except that once, but I; and nobody asked anything about her. The first occasion of her coming {{down into the}} house was on a Sunday afternoon. She had cried out, when I carried up her dinner, that she couldn't bear any longer being in the cold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross Grange, and Earnshaw and I needn't hinder her from descending; so, {{as soon as she}} heard Heathcliff's horse trot off, she made her appearance, donned in black, and her yellow curls combed back <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> as plain as a Quaker: she couldn't comb them out.|$|E
60|$|Tom, in the gladness of {{his heart}} at having dear old Maggie to dispute with and crow over again, seized her round the waist, and began to jump with her round the large library table. Away they jumped {{with more and more}} vigor, till Maggie's hair flew from <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> and twirled about like an {{animated}} mop. But the revolutions round the table became more and more irregular in their sweep, till at last reaching Mr. Stelling's reading stand, they sent it thundering down with its heavy lexicons to the floor. Happily it was the ground-floor, and the study was a one-storied wing to the house, so that the downfall made no alarming resonance, though Tom stood dizzy and aghast for a few minutes, dreading the appearance of Mr. or Mrs. Stelling.|$|E
60|$|There sat Feemy. Ah! how {{different}} from the girl described in the opening of this tale. Her cheek was pale and wan, and the flesh had gone, and the yellow skin fell in from her cheekbone to her mouth, giving her almost a ghastly appearance; her eyes appeared larger than ever, but they were quenched with weeping, and dull with grief; her hair was drawn back carelessly <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> and her lips were thin and bloodless. Two or three times during the day Mrs. McKeon had given her half a glass of wine, which she had drank on being told to do so, and she had once tried to eat a bit of bread. But she had soon put it down again, for it seemed to choke her.|$|E
60|$|Armed {{with this}} virtuous resolution, Christie sternly {{replaced}} the pretty hat with her old brown one, fastened up a becoming curl, which of late {{she had worn}} <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> {{and put on a}} pair of stout, rusty boots, much fitter for rocks and sand than the smart slippers she was preparing to sacrifice. Then she trudged away to Miss Tudor, bent on being very quiet and reserved, as became a meek and lowly governess.|$|R
50|$|The broad face is free {{of lines}} and wrinkles, and the {{features}} of her eyes, nose, and mouth are finely rendered. Her hair is parted in the center with a single pin-curl at her temple. A fringed cap rests half-way back {{on her head and}} is folded <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> There is a cameo at her throat, and the collar is fringed. Her shawl and bodice are plain and without definition or folds. Under the right breast are Bolton’s life dates, 1814-1893.|$|R
25|$|Clinton was {{scheduled}} {{to return to work}} the week of December 31, but then on December 30 was admitted to New York-Presbyterian Hospital for treatment and observation after a blood clot related to the concussion was discovered. On December 31 it was announced that the clot was <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> near <b>her</b> brain, specifically a right transverse sinus venous thrombosis, that she was being treated with anticoagulants, that she had not suffered any neurological damage, and that she was expected to make a full recovery.|$|R
6000|$|The sun was down, the sky all on fire, and {{the lamp}} {{had been some}} time lighted, when Case came back with Uma and the negro. She was dressed and scented; her kilt was of fine tapa, looking richer in the folds than any silk; her bust, which was of the colour of dark honey, she wore bare only for some half a dozen {{necklaces}} of seeds and flowers; and <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> and in her hair she had the scarlet flowers of the hibiscus. She showed the best bearing for a bride conceivable, serious and still; and I thought shame to stand up with her in that mean house and before that grinning negro. I thought shame, I say; for the mountebank was dressed with a big paper collar, the book he made believe to read from was an odd volume of a novel, and the words of his service not fit to be set down. My conscience smote me when we joined hands; {{and when she got}} her certificate I was tempted to throw up the bargain and confess. Here is the document. It was Case that wrote it, signatures and all, in a leaf out of the ledger:-- ...|$|E
60|$|As Emily had expected, {{her first}} {{troubles}} were with Phyllis; called, not the neat handed, by her sisters; Master Phyl, by her brothers; and Miss Tomboy, by the maids. She seemed {{born to be}} a trial of patience to all concerned with her; yet without many actual faults, except giddiness, restlessness, and unrestrained spirits. In the drawing-room, schoolroom, and nursery she was continually in scrapes, and so often reproved and repentant, that her loud roaring fits of crying were amongst the ordinary noises of the New Court. She was terribly awkward when under constraint, or in learning any female accomplishment, but swift and ready when at her ease, and glorying in the boyish achievements of leaping ditches and climbing trees. Her voice was rather highly pitched, and she had an inveterate habit of saying, 'I'll tell you what,' {{at the beginning of}} all her speeches. She was not tall, but strong, square, firm, and active; she had a round merry face, a broad forehead, and large bright laughing eyes, of a doubtful shade between gray and brown. Her mouth was wide, her nose turned up, her complexion healthy, but not rosy, and her stiff straight brown hair was more apt to hang over her eyes, than to remain in its proper place <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are going}} now, now soon, and I doubt {{not that you}} are going to joys inexpressible. I cannot go till some chance may take me. If it be given to you in that further world to see those and to think of those whom you have left below, then, if my heart be true to your heart, keep your heart true to mine. If I can fancy that, if I can believe that it is so, then shall I have that angel with me, and though my eyes may not see the tints, my ears will hear the music;--and though the glory be not palpable as is the light of heaven, there will be an inner glory in which my soul will be sanctified." [...] After that there were not many words spoken between them, though he {{remained}} there till he was disturbed by the Quaker's coming. Part of the time she slept with her hand in his, and when awake she was contented to feel his touch as he folded the scarf close round her neck and straightened the shawl which lay across her feet, and now and again stroked her hair and put it back <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> as it strayed upon her forehead. Ever and again she would murmur a word or two of love as she revelled in the perception of his solicitude. What was there for her to regret, for her to whom was given the luxury of such love? Was not a month of it more than a whole life without it? Then, when the father came, Hampstead took his leave. As he kissed her lips, something seemed to tell him that it would be for the last time. It was not good, the Quaker had said, that she should be disturbed. Yes; he could come again; but not quite yet.|$|E

60|$|Dick murmured {{something}} about never wanting {{a friend or}} a bottle to give him, and also gasped forth his favourite allusion to the wing of friendship and its never moulting a feather; but his faculties appeared to be absorbed in the contemplation of Miss Sally Brass, at whom he stared with blank and rueful looks, which delighted the watchful dwarf beyond measure.

6000|$|... and, as {{he rested}} on his oar, the pianissimo {{fall of the}} melodic wail [...] "nella miseria" [...] was {{distinctly}} audible {{on the brink of}} the water. Three or four persons had paused at various spots to watch the barge passing the bridge, and doubtless included in their notice the young gentleman in the boat; but probably it was only to one ear that the low vocal sounds came with more significance than if they had been an insect-murmur amidst the sum of current noises. Deronda, awaiting the barge, now turning his head to the river-side, and saw at a few yards' distant from him a figure which might have been an impersonation of the misery he was unconsciously giving voice to: a girl hardly more than eighteen, of low slim figure, with most delicate little face, her dark curls pushed <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> under a large black hat, a long woolen cloak over her shoulders. Her hands were hanging down clasped before her, and her eyes were fixed on the river with a look of immovable, statue-like despair. This strong arrest of his attention made him cease singing: apparently his voice had entered her inner world without her taking any note of whence it came, for when it suddenly ceased she changed her attitude slightly, and, looking round with a frightened glance, met Deronda's face. It was but a couple of moments, but that seemed a long while for two people to look straight at each other. Her look was something like that of a fawn or other gentle animal before it turns to run away: no blush, no special alarm, but only some timidity which yet could not hinder her from a long look before she turned. In fact, it seemed to Deronda that she was only half conscious of her surroundings: was she hungry, or was there some other cause of bewilderment? He felt an outleap of interest and compassion toward her; but the next instant she had turned and walked away to a neighboring bench under a tree. He had no right to linger and watch her: poorly-dressed, melancholy women are common sights; it was only the delicate beauty, picturesque lines and color of the image that was exceptional, and these conditions made it more markedly impossible that he should obtrude his interest upon her. He began to row away and was soon far up the river; but no other thoughts were busy enough quite to expel that pale image of unhappy girlhood. He fell again and again to speculating on the probable romance that lay behind that loneliness and look of desolation; then to smile at his own share in the prejudice that interesting faces must have interesting adventures; then to justify himself for feeling that sorrow was the more tragic when it befell delicate, childlike beauty.|$|E
60|$|As {{the weeks}} went by his {{exception}} {{had grown to}} look a good deal like a rule; but {{he was able to}} remind himself that the path of retreat was always open to him. Moreover, if he should {{fall in love with the}} younger girl there would be no great harm, for Kate Theory was in love only with her sister, and it would matter very little to her whether he advanced or retreated. She was very attractive, or rather very attracting. Small, pale, attentive without rigidity, full of pretty curves and quick movements, she looked as if the habit of watching and serving had taken complete possession of her, and was literally a little sister of charity. Her thick black hair was pushed <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> as if to help her to listen, and her clear brown eyes had the smile of a person too full of tact to cany a dull face to a sickbed. She spoke in an encouraging voice, and had soothing and unselfish habits. She was very pretty,--producing a cheerful effect of contrasted black and white, and dressed herself daintily, so that Mildred might have something agreeable to look at Benyon very soon perceived that there was a fund of good service in her. Her sister had it all now; but poor Miss Theory was fading fast, and then what would become of this precious little force? The answer to such a question that seemed most to the point was that it was none of his business. He was not sick,--at least not physically,--and he was not looking out for a nurse. Such a companion might be a luxury, but was not, as yet, a necessity: The welcome of the two ladies, at first, had been simple, and he scarcely knew what to call it but sweet; a bright, gentle friendliness remained the tone of their greeting. They evidently liked him to come,--they liked to see his big transatlantic ship hover about those gleaming coasts of exile. The fact of Miss Mildred being always stretched on her couch--in his successive visits to foreign waters Benyon had not unlearned (as why should he?) the pleasant American habit of using the lady's personal name--made their intimacy seem greater, their differences less; it was as if his hostesses had taken him into their confidence and he had been--as the consul would have said--of the same party. Knocking about the salt parts of the globe, with a few feet square on a rolling frigate for his only home, the pretty, flower-decked sitting-room of the quiet American sisters became, more than anything he had hitherto known, his interior. He had dreamed once of having an interior, but the dream had vanished in lurid smoke, and no such vision had come to him again. He had a feeling that the end of this was drawing nigh; he was sure that the advent of the strange brother, whose wife was certain to be disagreeable, would make a difference. That is why, as I have said, he came as often as possible the last week, after he had learned the day on which Percival Theory would arrive. The limits of the exception had been reached.|$|E

60|$|Racked {{by these}} {{conflicting}} impulses of self-preservation {{on the one}} hand and what seemed self-realization on the other, she started when, toward the middle of the afternoon, she heard Ditmar's voice summoning her to take his letters; and went palpitating, leaving the door open <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> seating herself on the far side of the desk, her head bent over her book. Her neck, where her hair grew in wisps <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> seemed to burn: Ditmar's glance was focussed there. Her hands were cold as she wrote.... Then, like a deliverer, she saw young Caldwell coming in from the outer office, holding a card in his hand which he gave to Ditmar, who sat staring at it.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} table near the fire, and beside it sat Lady Marchmont, writing notes, in the plainest and most {{becoming}} of morning dresses,--a sort of brown holland looking thing, with a plain, stiff, white collar, and a dark blue ribbon, her only ornament, except one large gold bracelet. Her hair was twisted in glossy sunny waves <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> as in some Greek statues; her blue eyes were bright and lustrous, and nothing was ever clearer and more delicate than the slight tinge of red on her cheeks. Lord Marchmont was standing leaning on the mantelshelf, apparently in consultation with her.|$|R

60|$|For {{one moment}} Shirley looked not quite certain {{whether she would}} obey the request or {{disregard}} it. A flicker of her eye beamed furtive on the professor's face.

She threw the veil of tresses <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> It was well her face owned an agreeable outline, and that her cheek possessed the polish and the roundness of early youth, or, thus robbed of a softening shade, the contours might have lost their grace. But what mattered that in the present society? Neither Calypso nor Eucharis cared to fascinate Mentor.|$|R
