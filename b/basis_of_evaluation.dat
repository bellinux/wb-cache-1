Obtaining good productivity by elasticity is ignored if old and long-term fixed prices are being used.

50|$|The Café Rouge is {{no longer}} {{considered}} {{a part of the}} Hotel Pennsylvania business and has a separate address and entrance from the street at 145 West 32nd Street. The hotel structure is currently owned by Vornado Realty Trust. In 2007, for the Garden in Transit project, adhesive weatherproof paintings of flowers attached to NYC taxicabs were painted inside the Café. Numerous events from the 2013 New York Fashion Week were held in the Cafe Rouge. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission reviewed the Café Rouge for landmarking status on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaluation</b> papers created by the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society (formerly the Save Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation) On October 22, 2010 the Café was rejected as a candidate for landmarking, most likely because the 15 Penn Plaza project was approved. The 15 Penn Plaza project, which was abandoned in 2013, would have included the demolition of the Café. In 2014, the Café Rouge was converted to an indoor basketball court known as Terminal 23, to promote the launch of the Melo M10 by the Jordan Brand division of Nike. Most of the original interior decor remains intact. The fountain and beamed ceiling and other architectural details remain, though the entire room, as well as the ceiling, have been painted over in white.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the governance of vertical interfirm relations, i. e. relations between buyers and their suppliers on industrial, intermediate-goods markets. Networks of interacting, adaptive buyers and suppliers are viewed as complex adaptive systems (Holland and Miller 1991), which we study using computer simulations. Starting from a static transaction cost economic perspective, our model is extended with allowance for loyal behavior and for trust to build up and with temporal and network embeddedness of relations. The paper analyzes how relations develop in time: actors making and breaking relations, on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> expected profitability and loyalty. When allowance is made for adaptation of the relative weights attached to each of these criteria, the result is that buyers adaptively shift the weight from profitability to loyalty. This is an especially interesting and strong result, because the fitness measure on which adaptation is based is profit only. Transaction costs, governance, loyalty, artificial adaptive agents...|$|R
