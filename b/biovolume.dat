40|$|The {{distribution}} of biomass within the phytoplankton community in northern San Francisco Bay Estuary {{was influenced by}} environmental conditions resulting from an interdecadal climate regime shift between 1975 and 1993. A decrease in percentage of diatom <b>biovolume</b> characterized the period 1975 – 1989 and was caused by both a decrease in diatom {{and an increase in}} green and bluegreen algae and flagellate species <b>biovolume.</b> Among the diatoms, there was a greater loss of pennate than centric diatoms. The direct role of climate variation on phyto-plankton community <b>biovolume</b> was determined using climatically-related environmental variation that was isolated from the total environmental variation using the covariance between a California climate index and a suite of physical and chemical variables and summarized by principal component analysis.

40|$|Zooplankton are an {{important}} component of the food web in freshwater lake ecosystems. Despite there being an abundance of density data for zooplankton taxa in these lakes, there is very little information that exists about pelagic zooplankton <b>biovolume</b> or biomass in temperate lakes. <b>Biovolume</b> is a useful estimate of biomass energy because it determines how much space a species occupies. For this research, we developed new <b>biovolume</b> techniques for freshwater zooplankton based on body size and geometric shape. These techniques were applied to two groups of crustacean zooplankton, the copepods and the cladocerans. Copepod <b>biovolume</b> is broken into two formulas: the ellipsoid formula and the cone formula. For the cladocerans, two formulas were used: one for the Bosminidae family and one for Daphnidae family. Daphnia <b>biovolume</b> is composed of two formulas: the ellipsoid formula and the cylinder formula. The Bosminid family <b>biovolume</b> formula is the same as the ellipsoid formula.

Based on OPC data, spatial (north-south and east-west) changes in mesozooplankton abundance, <b>biovolume</b> and Normalized <b>Biovolume</b> Size Spectra (NBSS) were evaluated. Throughout the transects, north-south variations in zooplankton communities were similar : i. e. abundance was greater in the subarctic (SA) region, <b>biovolume</b> was greater in the transitional (TR) region and slope of NBSS was moderate in TR. High <b>biovolume</b> and moderate NBSS slope in TR were caused by the dominance of late copepodid stages (C 5) of Neocalanus copepods.

During the study period (July-September 2007), phytoplankton composition was indicative of eutrophic conditions although phytoplankton <b>biovolume</b> was low (max. 2. 7 mm(3) l (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)). Phytoplankton was dominated by cyanobacteria and diatoms, whereas desmids and dinoflagellates contributed with lower <b>biovolume</b> values. Changing flushing rate in the reservoir (up to 0. 7 % of reservoir's water volume per day) driven by water withdrawal and occurring in pulses {{for a period of}} 15 - 25 days was associated with phytoplankton dynamics.

In Lake Tjeukemeer, microcystins were present throughout summer (maximum concentration 30 µg l 1) while cyanobacterial diversity was low and very constant. The dominant phototroph was Planktothrix agardhii. In contrast, Lake Klinckenberg showed a high microcystin peak (up to 140 µg l 1) of short duration. In this lake, cyanobacterial diversity was higher and very dynamic with apparent genotype successions. Several genotypes derived from DGGE field profiles matched with genotypes from cultures isolated from field samples. The microcystin peak measured in Lake Klinckenberg could be confidently linked to a bloom of Planktothrix rubescens, as microscopic and genotypic analysis showed identity of bloom samples and a toxin-producing P. rubescens culture. Toxin-producing genotypes were detected in the microbial community before they reached densities at which they were detected by using microscopy. Cyanobacterial <b>biovolumes</b> provided additional insights in bloom dynamics. In both lakes, the microcystin content per cell was highest {{at the onset of the}} blooms. Our results suggest that while genotypic characterization of a lake can be valuable for detection of toxic organisms, for some lakes a monitoring of algal biomass has sufficient predictive value for an assessment of toxin production. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} copepods on the seston community in a mesocosm set-up, and assessed how the changes in food quantity, quality and size affected {{the condition of the}} grazers, by measuring the RNA:DNA ratios in different developmental stages of Calanus finmarchicus. Manipulated copepod densities did not affect the particulate carbon concentration in the mesocosms. On the other hand, chlorophyll a content increased with higher copepod densities, and increasing densities had a positive effect on seston food quality in the mesocosms, measured as C:N ratios and omega 3 :omega 6 fatty acid ratios. These food quality indicators were significantly correlated to the nutritional status of C. finmarchicus. In contrast to our expectations, these results suggest a lower copepod growth potential on higher quality food. However, in concordance with earlier studies, we found that when copepods were in high densities the large particles (> 1000 mum(3)) decreased and that the smaller particles (< 1000 mum(3)) increased in number. These patterns were closely linked to the condition of C. finmarchicus, which were of better condition (RNA:DNA ratios) with increasing <b>biovolumes</b> of large particles, and, conversely, lower RNA:DNA ratios with increasing <b>biovolumes</b> of smaller particles. Consequentially, the selective grazing by copepods stimulated increased <b>biovolumes</b> of smaller plankton, and this increase was responsible for the increased food quality, in terms of C:N and omega 3 :omega 6 ratios. Thus, we conclude that the decreasing growth potentials of C. finmarchicus were a result of a decrease of favourably sized food particles, induced by copepod grazing...|$|R
40|$|Ecosystem {{functioning}} {{is affected}} by horizontal (within trophic groups) and vertical (across trophic levels) biodiversity.

In a microcosm experiment, we investigated ciliate consumer diversity and specialization effects on algal prey <b>biovolume,</b> evenness and composition, and on ciliate <b>biovolume</b> production. The experimental data was complemented by a process-based model further analyzing the ecological mechanisms behind the observed diversity effects. Overall, increasing consumer diversity had no significant effect on prey <b>biovolume</b> or evenness. However, consumer specialization affected the prey community. Specialist consumers showed a stronger negative impact on prey <b>biovolume</b> and evenness than generalists. The model confirmed that this pattern was mainly driven by a single specialist with a high per capita grazing rate, consuming the two most productive prey species. When these were suppressed, the prey assemblage became dominated by a less productive species, consequently decreasing prey <b>biovolume</b> and evenness. Consumer diversity increased consumer <b>biovolume,</b> which was stronger for generalists than for specialists and highest in mixed combinations, indicating that consumer functional diversity, i. e. more diverse feeding strategies, increased resource use efficiency. Overall, our results indicate that consumer diversity effects on prey and consumers strongly depend on species-specific growth and grazing rates, which may be at least equally important as consumer specialization in driving consumer diversity effects across trophic levels...|$|E

In {{the first method}} (Vsphere), particles {{are assumed to be}} opaque spheres. In the other two methods, particles are represented as opaque spheroids, oriented with their major axes either parallel to the flow thus presenting maximum shadow area (Vmax), or randomly orientated relative to the flow (Vran). The models were tested by comparing with net <b>biovolume,</b> measured from samples of a zooplankton assemblage dominated by Calanus finmarchicus collected during a cruise to the northeast Atlantic during 2001. The randomly orientated spheroidal model (Vran) provided the best fit with the net data: on average the ratio of OPC <b>biovolume</b> to net <b>biovolume</b> was 1. 02, compared to ratios of 0. 84 when calculating OPC <b>biovolume</b> as Vmax and 1. 50 when calculating as Vsphere. The Vran and Vmax methods gave reasonable estimates of net <b>biovolume</b> from OPC measurements without recourse to the use of empirical tuning parameters that are otherwise required.

An experiment {{was carried out in}} 40 m 2 ponds stocked with a stocking density of 2 prawn juveniles (5. 023 ± 0. 02 g) m¿ 2. A locally formulated and prepared feed containing 30 % crude protein with C/N ratio 10 was applied to all ponds. In order to raise the C/N ratio of the feed input to 15 and 20, tapioca starch was applied separately as a source of carbohydrate in addition to the artificial feed. Under substrate treatments, bamboo side shoots were posted vertically in pond bottoms resulting in 100 % additional surface area as periphyton substrates. The treatments with different C/N ratios are referred to as "CN 10 ", "CN 15 " and "CN 20 ". Increasing the C/N ratio from 10 to 20 significantly increased the <b>biovolume</b> of phytoplankton, crustaceans and rotifers in the water column by 15 %, 6 % and 11 %, respectively. The <b>biovolume</b> of periphyton was 50 % higher in treatment CN 20 compared to treatment CN 10. Increasing the C/N ratio from 10 to 20 raised the <b>biovolume</b> of total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) in the water column (70 %), sediment (36 %) and periphyton (40 %). The chironomids <b>biovolume</b> was also significantly higher (28 %) in treatment CN 20 compared to treatment CN 10. The addition of substrates decreased the <b>biovolume</b> of water column plankton by 14 % but the combined <b>biovolume</b> (plankton+ periphyton) was almost double in substrate-added ponds. The <b>biovolume</b> of plankton, periphyton and THB increased significantly with culture time duration whereas the <b>biovolume</b> of benthic macroinvertebrates decreased significantly with culture time indicating that freshwater prawn grazed on them. A significant interaction between C/N ratios and substrate presence or absence was only observed for plankton <b>biovolume</b> in the water column. This study demonstrated that plankton, periphyton and microbial biofloc communities were under-utilized by the freshwater prawn in treatment CN 20.

40|$|Biotic and abiotic {{surfaces}} {{submerged in}} aquatic systems {{are prone to}} rapid colonisation by marine organisms in a process called biofouling. Biofouling starts {{with the formation of}} an organic conditioning layer, which promotes adhesion of single celled microorganisms and the development of surface attached biofilm communities. Once established, biofilms provide a suitable environment for the settlement of macrofoulers, and this biofouling process results in major economic losses to various maritime industries. This study investigates the use of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces with specific micro-scaled surface topographies as a novel, nontoxic, alternative antifouling solution. The surfaces were placed in environmental chambers enclosed in 1. 2 µm filters, and exposed to the marine environment. The effects of surface topographies on the architecture of natural established attached communities were assessed. Further, the impact of enhanced protozoan predation pressure by the addition of a heterotrophic flagellate, Rhynchomonas nasuta on biofilm architecture and composition was investigated. Results show that some micro-fabricated PDMS surfaces had microcolonies that grew along the textured grooves on the surface. Surprisingly, there was a high number of natural flagellates (2 - 5 µm) on the pre-established biofilms. Enhanced grazing by R. nasuta did not result in significant effects on biofilm <b>biovolumes</b> on micro-fabricated surfaces but the attached <b>biovolumes</b> were significantly affected by surface topographies. Four and 10 µm micro-scaled surfaces supported the lowest <b>biovolumes</b> compared to the flat PDMS control surfaces, indicating that these surfaces limited microbial attachment. The 10 µm surface also indicated that the enhanced grazing pressure reduced the attached community. Depending on seasonal variation, enhanced grazing pressure by R. nasuta induced shifts in microbial community composition. No correlation was observed between the micro-fabricated surfaces and community composition. This in situ study provides insights into the effects of PDMS micro-fabricated surfaces on attachment of microorganisms and the stability of the attached communities under grazing pressure. The 4 and 10 µm micro-fabricated surfaces may be promising nontoxic anti-microfouling surfaces for use in broad biomedical and industrial applications...|$|R

Algal assemblages {{have been}} {{included}} in biological monitoring in a number of national, large-scale and long-term biological monitoring and assessment programmes of streams, lakes and wetlands. However, there has been no substantial investigation of alternative enumeration strategies. 2. We compared the sampling efficiency of the common periphyton subsampling strategies of counting 300 cells by strip counts or random fields and measuring 10 cells per taxon for <b>biovolume,</b> with line-intercept sampling (LIS), using samples collected from four streams differing in canopy cover and discharge. We also simulated the optimum ratio of cells tallied to cells measured for <b>biovolume</b> for all approaches. 3. LIS was 1. 6 - 5. 5 times more efficient at estimating algal taxa <b>biovolume</b> than the 300 -cell count methods. LIS performed best relative to conventional 300 -cell count methods in streams with high <b>biovolume,</b> although efficiency gains were still noticeable in low <b>biovolume</b> streams. In addition, LIS tended to detect more taxa than the conventional 300 -cell target biological assessment methods. 4. In simulations, LIS was more efficient than the conventional methods for nearly all combinations of target cell count and cells measured for <b>biovolume.</b> No single optimal ratio of cells counted to cells measured was found. The target cell count that resulted in the greatest efficiency was higher in assemblages with large variation in cell density. Likewise, assemblages with high variance in taxa <b>biovolume</b> were most efficiently sampled by measuring more cells. 5. Synthesis and applications. An increase in sampling efficiency as a result of greater adoption of LIS sampling may result in more accurate estimation of the relationships between periphyton community composition and environmental factors, and more sensitive detection of impacts using stream periphyton. Additionally, LIS may improve estimates in other ecological research fields employing microscopic counting chambers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Aim: We {{aimed to}} assess the {{influence}} of bottom-up and top-down control mechanisms on the abundance and size structure of protist communities (heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates). We formulated the following hypothesis: bottom-up control mechanisms, related to the availability of resources in the environment, are responsible for structuring the abundance of these communities, whereas top-down control mechanisms, related to predation effects, determine the size pattern of these organisms. Methods Samples for planktonic organisms were taken in 20 shallow lakes belonging to the upper Paraná River floodplain. We evaluated linear regression models to select the best model which predicts the patterns observed according to Akaike Information Criterion. Results The best models selected to explain the abundance of heterotrophic flagellates included negative relations with picophytoplankton abundance and positive with rotifers abundance, while for their size structure, negative relationships were found with heterotrophic bacteria, ciliates and rotifers <b>biovolumes.</b> In relation to the ciliates, their abundances were positively related to the rotifers and picophytoplankton abundances and negatively with the heterotrophic bacteria abundance. On the other hand, for the size structure, the best models selected strong negative relations with the microcrustaceans <b>biovolumes,</b> in addition to relations with the different fractions of the phytoplankton. Conclusion For both flagellates and ciliates, their abundance is being mainly regulated by a bottom up control mechanism, whereas for the size structure {{the results showed that}} both food resources and predators were important, indicating that bottom-up and top-down mechanisms act simultaneously in determining the size of these microorganisms...|$|R

We used a saliva-conditioned flow cell, with saliva as the sole nutritional source, as a model to examine the development of multispecies biofilm communities from an inoculum containing the coaggregation partners Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella atypica, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Biofilms inoculated with individual species in a sequential order were compared with biofilms inoculated with coaggregates of the four species. Our results indicated that flow cells inoculated sequentially produced biofilms with larger <b>biovolumes</b> compared to those biofilms inoculated with coaggregates. Individual-species <b>biovolumes</b> within the four-species communities also differed between the two modes of inoculation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with genus- and species-specific probes revealed that the majority of cells in both sequentially and coaggregate-inoculated biofilms were S. gordonii, regardless of the inoculation order. However, the representation of A. naeslundii and V. atypica was significantly higher in biofilms inoculated with coaggregates compared to sequentially inoculated biofilms. Thus, these results indicate that the development of multispecies biofilm communities is influenced by coaggregations preformed in planktonic phase. Coaggregating bacteria such as certain streptococci are especially adapted to primary colonization of saliva-conditioned surfaces independent of the mode of inoculation and order of addition in the multispecies inoculum. Preformed coaggregations favor other bacterial strains and may facilitate symbiotic relationships...|$|R
40|$|Fungal infections {{of seven}} species of {{phytoplankton}} {{were examined in}} relation to the host species' exponential rate of net increase, and to their proportional contribution to the total phytoplankton <b>biovolume.</b> Infections were observed to increase at <b>biovolume</b> proportions of the host species of as low as 1 %. In most algal species, infected cells were always found at higher proportions, with the exception of Stephanodiscus rotula and Fragilaria crotonensis. In these two species, high proportions of <b>biovolume</b> were reached without any evidence of infected cells. The increase in infected cells was usually associated with a growing host population, whereas peak and decreasing densities of infected cells were usually observed when host populations were declining. The results show that the fungal parasites can exist on their host population even if it comprises {{only a small fraction of}} the total phytoplankton <b>biovolume,</b> and that the parasites become evident while the host population is still increasing...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we use {{empirical}} modeling {{to predict}} and understand phytoplankton dynamics in a reservoir affected by water transfers. Prediction of phytoplankton <b>biovolume</b> {{is central to}} the management of water resources, particularly given the significant impacts on quality of the water-quantity oriented management of transfers between reservoirs. A novel tree-based iterative input variable selection algorithm is applied {{for the first time in}} an ecological context, and identifies a maximum of eight driving factors out of 77 candidates to explain the <b>biovolume</b> of chlorophytes, cyanobacteria and diatoms. The stepwise forward-selection to iteratively identify the most important inputs leads to a physically interpretable model able to infer the physical processes controlling phytoplankton <b>biovolume.</b> Reservoir inflows and outflows are found to exert a strong control over diatom and chlorophyte dynamics while water temperature, nitrate and phosphorus determine the <b>biovolume</b> of cyanobacteria. Following the selection of the most relevant inputs, the 1 week ahead predictions of four different data-driven model classes, i. e., neural networks, extra trees (ETs), model trees and linear regressions, are compared based on performance indices and statistical tests. ETs are found to outperform the other models by providing accurate predictions of cyanobacteria, chlorophyte and diatom <b>biovolume</b> by explaining 66. 6...|$|E
30|$|The highest {{absolute}} amount of DHA normalized to <b>biovolume</b> {{was measured in}} the prymnesiophyte E. huxleyi (27.7 fg DHA μm- 3), followed by the Antarctic prasinophyte Pyramimonas sp. (8.75 fg DHA μm- 3) (Table  2). Relatively low DHA levels were observed for the Antarctic diatom Chaetoceros brevis (0.02 fg DHA μm- 3), while DHA was undetectable in the raphidophyte Fibrocapsa japonica (Table  2). When normalized to <b>biovolume,</b> absolute EPA content was highest in F. japonica (2.93 fg μm- 3). Lowest EPA levels were found in Emiliania huxleyi (0.89 fg EPA μm- 3) while EPA was undetectable in Pyramimonas sp.. Overall, DHA levels showed the highest interspecific variability, varying two orders of magnitude on a <b>biovolume</b> basis (Table  2).|$|E
40|$|International audienceCyanobacteria {{and their}} toxins {{are known as}} a health hazard in recreative and {{distributed}} waters. Monitoring data from 2004 to 2011 were collected at regional scale to characterize exposition parameters to microcystins in Brittany (Western France). The data show that cyanobacteria populations are experiencing a composition shift leading to a longer duration of cell densities higher than WHO alert levels 2 and 3. Microcystins however {{appear to be more}} frequently detected with subacute concentrations in low cell density samples than in high cell density samples or during bloom episodes. Positive relations are described between microcystin concentrations, detection frequencies and cyanobacteria <b>biovolumes,</b> allowing for a novel definition of alert levels and decision framework following WHO recommendation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{examined}} how interactions {{among the three}} dominant species of the Macoma balthica Community in the St-Lawrence estuary influence net biogeochemical fluxes and {{the composition of the}} sedimentary bacterial community. We manipulated the biodiversity of the community via combinations of Macoma balthica, Mya arenaria, and Nereis virens in sediment microcosms containing sieved and homogenized tidal-flat sediment. Each combination was adjusted to similar total <b>biovolumes</b> and in situ animal densities. Compared to treatments with single species, which were also adjusted to similar <b>biovolumes</b> and densities, combinations of multiple species changed the fluxes of oxygen, phosphate, ammonium, and nitrate across the sediment-water interface and altered the composition of the microbial community beyond the level predicted by linear addition of the single species effects. Most combinations involved positive interactions that increased net fluxes. Although N. virens dominated system behavior, we also observed positive interactions between the two bivalves, and between N. virens and M. balthica. Weaker interactions, sometimes negative, were observed between N. virens and M. arenaria. Most effects could be directly linked to total oxic sediment volumes and burrow volumes generated by the different species. N. virens had the maximum species-specific burrow volume/biovolume ratio, and its presence maximally impacted fluxes. The principal interactions between species that affect net solute fluxes reflect space occupation, life habit (position, location), and irrigation of burrows. These factors interact with reactive substrate distributions and remineralization patterns to produce particular flux balances. Future studies should include the relationships of biodiversity to spatial scales over which the functional groups are distributed, the volumes actively occupied and irrigated, production rates of burrows, and the depths to which the organisms burrow...|$|R
40|$|Phytoplankton blooms are a well {{described}} phenomenon. However, {{while the}} succession of species is also usually well documented, the mechanisms that drive it still remain unknown to a large extent. Correlations between algal behaviour and biotic and abiotic factors can provide valuable information, but, as long as little continues to be known about the requirements of individual species such correlations remain somewhat speculative. To obtain a better insight, we cultured five key diatom species, from different phases during the 2004 spring bloom, under 5 different nutrient regimes at two grazer related stress levels and at three temperatures. Photosynthetic efficiency, growth rate, individual <b>biovolumes</b> and colony size were measured. The results of this experiment {{can be linked to}} data from the 2004 spring bloom and show different life strategies, preferences and reaction patterns that might explain the observed succession during blooms...|$|R
