50|$|The least grebe, while {{a species}} of least concern, {{experiences}} a number of predators, particularly early in life. Large fish species and turtles are reported to take young grebes, and bird-eating raptors, including the <b>bat</b> <b>falcon,</b> have been observed taking adult birds.|$|E
50|$|The {{orange-breasted falcon}} (Falco deiroleucus) is a bird of the falcon family. It is {{probably}} {{closely related to}} and looks like a larger version of the <b>bat</b> <b>falcon.</b> These two, in turn, are probably closest to the aplomado falcon and constitute a rather old American lineage of Falcos.|$|E
50|$|Predators of bats include <b>bat</b> hawks, <b>bat</b> <b>falcons,</b> snakes, {{and even}} spiders.|$|R
50|$|Other common {{birds of}} Victoria Peak and the Cockscomb Basin include: great curassow, crested guan, clay-coloured robins, social flycatchers, collared-seed eaters, crimson-collared tanagers and masked tanagers, <b>bat</b> <b>falcons,</b> Montezuma’s oropendola, {{as well as}} white-collared manakins, paraque, the slaty-breasted tinamou, {{chestnut}} headed oropendolas, parrots, toucans, and Agami heron to name a few.|$|R
50|$|This small dark {{bird of prey}} inhabits open {{woodlands}} {{and forest}} clearings. <b>Bat</b> <b>falcons</b> perch conspicuously on high, open snags, from which they launch aerial attacks on their prey. They hunt bats, birds, and large insects such as dragonflies. The smaller male takes more insects, and the female more birds and bats. The flight is direct and powerful. This falcon is partly crepuscular, as the bats in its diet suggest. It lays two or three brown eggs in an unlined treehole nest.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bat</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco rufigularis) is a falcon {{that is a}} {{resident}} breeder in tropical Mexico, Central and South America, and Trinidad. It was long known as Falco albigularis; the names Falco fusco-coerulescens or Falco fuscocaerulescens, long used for the aplomado falcon, are now believed {{to refer to the}} present species.|$|E
50|$|About 520 {{bird species}} have been {{reported}} in the park including: the blue-headed macaw, Spix's guan, the <b>bat</b> <b>falcon,</b> the red-bellied macaw, the sunbittern, the spangled cotinga, the king vulture, the white-necked jacobin, Chapman's swift, the ocellated poorwill, the pygmy antwren, the white-throated toucan, the jabiru, the golden-tailed sapphire, the Amazon kingfisher, the harpy eagle, the red-necked woodpecker, the scarlet macaw, the Amazonian royal flycatcher, etc.|$|E
50|$|The female <b>bat</b> <b>falcon,</b> at 30.5 cm length, is {{much larger}} than the 23-cm-long male. Adults have a black back, head, and tail. The throat, upper breast, and neck sides are creamy white, the lower breast and belly are black, finely barred white, and the thighs and lower belly are orange. Young birds are similar, but with a buffy throat. The call of this species is a high pitched ke-ke-ke like the American kestrel.|$|E
50|$|Animals that inhabit this {{national}} park are moose, snowshoe hares, chipmunks, cormorants, red squirrels, pileated woodpeckers, little brown <b>bats,</b> peregrine <b>falcons,</b> black bears, coyotes, beavers, white-tailed deer, white-winged crossbills, various mice and shrews, juncos, sandpipers, raccoons, warblers, plovers, great blue herons, and northern flying squirrels.|$|R
5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} {{out of sight of}} predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and <b>bat</b> <b>falcons.</b> This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|R
5|$|Rancho Grande {{was located}} at a {{mountain}} pass in {{a branch of}} the Andes known as the Venezuelan Coastal Range, which was an important migration route for butterflies, and the station proved very lucrative in the study of insects. During his work at Rancho Grande, Beebe broke his leg in a fall from a ladder, and the forced immobility which resulted from having his leg in a cast presented him with a new opportunity for observing the area's wildlife. At his request, he and his chair were transported into the nearby jungle, and as he sat motionless the wild animals around him soon began to go about their business without noticing his presence. His immobility also presented him with the opportunity to spend hours at a time observing a pair of <b>bat</b> <b>falcons</b> through binoculars, documenting the behavior of their two chicks and every prey item fed to them by their parents. His observations documented several behaviors which were new to science, including the first documented example of play in birds.|$|R

50|$|Since 1970, The Peregrine Fund has hatched {{and raised}} 20 species of rare birds and pioneered {{propagation}} and releasing techniques for numerous species. Species systematically {{released to the}} wild to develop techniques or restore wild populations include the Aplomado falcon, bald eagle, <b>bat</b> <b>falcon,</b> California condor, harpy eagle, Madagascar fish eagle, Mauritius kestrel, orange-breasted falcon, and prairie falcon. Overall, the organization has monitored, surveyed and worked with more than 100 raptor species in the wild around the world.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aplomado falcon}} (Falco femoralis) is a {{medium-sized}} falcon of the Americas. The species' largest contiguous range is in South America, {{but not in}} the deep interior Amazon Basin. It was long known as Falco fusco-coerulescens or Falco fuscocaerulescens, but these names are now believed to refer to the <b>bat</b> <b>falcon</b> (F. rufigularis). Its resemblance in shape to the hobbies accounts for its old name orange-chested hobby. Aplomado is an unusual Spanish word for [...] "lead-colored", referring to the blue-grey areas of the plumage [...] - [...] an approximate English translation would be [...] "plumbeous falcon". Spanish names for the species include halcón aplomado and halcón fajado (roughly [...] "banded falcon" [...] in reference to the characteristic pattern); in Brazil it is known as falcão-de-coleira.|$|E
40|$|Three {{years of}} {{breeding}} season {{data were collected}} on the reproductive behavior and food habits of Laughing Falcons, Herpetotheres cachinnans, in northern Guatemala to describe aspects of foraging and nesting ecology of this little-studied species. Twenty-three nesting attempts were observed at thirteen nest sites. Vocalizations, nest sites and associated hymenoptera were described and growth curves developed from measurements of the young. There was an indication that nesting attempts associated with nidicolous ants increased fledging success, possibly by decreasing ectoparasite (likely Philornis sp.) loads. Foraging and habitat information was gathered through telemetry studies and observations of un-telemetered birds. Laughing Falcons foraged in every available habitat, showing a preferrence for intact forest and arboreal snakes. They utilized a range of forest strata, from 3 ̆c 2 m to emergent canopy trees. It was found that Laughing Falcons were monophagous, eating only snakes in the primary forest of Parque Nacional Tikal and polyphagous outside the borders, where slash-and-burn agricultural practices have modified the landscape. Herpetofauna comprised the majority of Laughing Falcon diets from an observed total of 767 prey items. In mosaic, altered landscapes, Laughing Falcons foraged for snakes, lizards, some small mammals, birds and fish. These birds illustrate a remarkably clear example of an optimally-foraging species, acting as snake specialists in intact rainforest and generalists in human-altered, mosaic habitats. Four pairs of <b>Bat</b> <b>Falcons,</b> Falco rufigularis, were observed in the tropical dry rainforests of Tikal National Park in northern Guatemala to describe feeding ecology and behavior {{of males and females}} in this highly sexually dimorphic aerial predator. Food deliveries were observed to identify the relative abundance and importance of different prey species in the diet of males and females. Prey items were identified to the species level when possible and prey biomass estimates were made. Prey remains were collected daily from one nest. Over 1, 500 observational hours at the four nests identified 197 prey species and very little difference between sexes in prey size or type. Hunting excursions were observed above the canopy at two nests and capture attempts were recorded to reveal no significant differences in success rates between males and females. There were, however, significant differences between nests as to prey types, prey biomass and the female 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to prey deliveries. Novel foraging behavior was observed as <b>Bat</b> <b>Falcons</b> gleaned insects from tree leaves...|$|R

These rodents forage in relatively open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|R
50|$|The Bode Gorge ist also {{a habitat}} and refuge for {{many types of}} rare animal. Such rarities include the wildcat, Bechstein's <b>bat,</b> {{peregrine}} <b>falcon,</b> black stork, middle spotted woodpecker. The insect fauna is particularly varied.The white-throated dipper and grey wagtail can be observed hunting for insects on the stream beds. Mallard breed {{here and there in}} the reed beds or on remote gravel beds.In spring fire salamanders can be seen splashing about in the Bode Gorge during the spawning season. Care must be taken when walking not to disturb them.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species may}} be {{confused}} with the <b>bat</b> <b>falcon</b> (F. rufigularis) and the orange-breasted falcon (F. deiroleucus), which have similar white-black-rust patterns below, but those species are built more like peregrine falcons and have solidly blackish heads and darker rufous bellies. These two species are generally considered to belong to the same lineage as the aplomado falcon. Two other Falco species of the Americas, merlin (F. columbarius) and American kestrel (F. sparverius), seem to be closer to the Aplomado group than most other falcons, but the relationships of all these lineages are fairly enigmatic. All that can be said with some certainty is that they diverged as part of an apparently largely western Holarctic radiation in the Late Miocene, probably around [...]|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} from {{southern}} Mexico to northern Argentina. It's a medium-sized falcon at 35 - 40 cm long and a weight of 325 - 700 g. It is a bird predator, with strong talons that {{enable it to}} catch prey in flight, and is considered by some -such as the German-Brazilian ornithologist Helmut Sick - as filling the ecological niche of the peregrine falcon as a breeding species in tropical America. The orange-breasted falcon, however, seems to favor more heavily wooded habitats than the peregrine, therefore the species {{does not seem to}} be in ecological competition with peregrine falcons wintering or breeding in South America. The orange-breasted falcon has a similar plumage to the much smaller <b>bat</b> <b>falcon</b> and is generally considered most closely related to that species now.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to feral horses, the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Refuge {{is also a}} good place to see other wildlife and plant species. [...] Among the species found there are Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, black bears, blue grouse, cougars, elk, gray wolves, mule deer, ring-necked pheasant, and sage grouse. The Pryor Mountains are also home to the most diverse bat populations in Montana, with 10 species identified (and potentially other species also present). [...] The range is also home to several animals which BLM or the state of Montana considers sensitive to ecological change, such as Baird's sparrow, long-eared myotis (a species of vesper bat), pallid <b>bat,</b> peregrine <b>falcon,</b> spotted <b>bat,</b> Townsend's big-eared bat, and Yellowstone cutthroat trout. There are also 15 species of plants on the range which have been granted special status by the state of Montana or the federal government.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{herds of}} bighorn sheep {{live in the}} park, with some {{spending}} the whole year in the park, and some migrating into nearby alpine areas in the summer. Mule deer are also present. The grassland environment is home to birds, bats, small rodents, and reptile species. Bird species include the Brewer's sparrow, Lewis's woodpecker, long-billed curlew, gyrfalcon, short-eared owl, and prairie <b>falcon.</b> <b>Bats</b> include the Western small-footed myotis, and reptiles include the rubber boa and the gopher snake. [...] The forests contain flammulated owl, Townsend's big-eared bat, and sharp-tailed grouse.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, the Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka {{suggested}} the broad-billed parrot was nocturnal, like the kakapo {{and the night}} parrot, two extant ground-dwelling parrots. Contemporary accounts do not corroborate this, and the orbits are of similar size {{to those of other}} large diurnal parrots. The broad-billed parrot was recorded on the dry leeward side of Mauritius, which was the most accessible for people, and it was noted that birds were more abundant near the coast, which may indicate that the fauna of such areas was more diverse. It may have nested in tree cavities or rocks, like the Cuban amazon. The terms raven or crow may have been suggested by the bird's harsh call, its behavioural traits, or just its dark plumage. The following description by Jacob Granaet from 1666 mentions some of the broad-billed parrot's co-inhabitants of the forests, and might indicate its demeanour: Within the forest dwell parrots, turtle and other wild doves, mischievous and unusually large ravens parrots, <b>falcons,</b> <b>bats</b> and other birds whose name I do not know, never having seen before. Many other endemic species of Mauritius were lost after the arrival of man, so the ecosystem of the island is severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, almost all of which have since been lost to deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The broad-billed parrot lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and Réunion but became extinct in both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.|$|R
