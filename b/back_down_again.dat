5|$|The {{pulsations}} {{result from}} a process called the κ-mechanism. A part of the star's outer atmosphere becomes optically thick due to partial ionization of certain elements. When these atoms lose an electron, the likelihood that they will absorb energy increases. This results {{in an increase in}} temperature that causes the atmosphere to expand. The inflated atmosphere becomes less ionized and loses energy, causing it to cool and shrink <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>again.</b> The result of this cycle is a periodic pulsation of the atmosphere and a matching variation of the luminosity.|$|E

[...] He gave the single three out of five stars. Popjustice, while stating the song is [...] "rather enjoyable", added that it is a [...] "no-harm-intended album track" [...] instead of [...] "the big balls-out I'm-bloody-Kylie comeback single". They remarked at a later date, saying that they were [...] "slightly alarmed" [...] when the song became a single. Nima Baniamer of Contact Music described the song as [...] "a fun electro number", but it [...] "sadly doesn't seem to pack a punch enough to stand firm as a lead-out track". Originally in an album review, Levine of Digital Spy called the tune [...] "as uplifting a dance-pop ditty as we're likely to hear all year". In a single review, Levine re-evaluated the song, stating that it is not [...] "the freshest confection you'll sample this party season" [...] but he continued, calling it [...] "sweet, seductive and pretty much impossible not to succumb to over and over again". He gave the single four out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|He was {{in charge}} for the first game at the Walkers Stadium. Despite a good start to their campaign, the club fell into the relegation zone in the new year. Adams was clearly resentful of lucrative long term {{contracts}} dealt out to his less talented players by previous managers, which restricted his ability to bring in fresh faces to boost their campaign. Leicester slipped <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>again</b> in 2003–04 to 18th place, bracketed together with the two other relegated sides — Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers — whose goal difference was inferior to Leicester's. The [...] "Foxes" [...] were becoming a [...] "yo-yo club" [...] and Adams blamed this on a lack of investment. During March 2004 nine Leicester players were arrested for various offences related to a drunken outing that ended with an alleged sexual assault on three German tourists, with three players being charged: Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie. The three faced up to fourteen years in prison if found guilty of rape, and the trio's bail totalled £196,500. The club had already been rocked by various incidents on overseas tours over years, with Stan Collymore arrested for setting off a fire extinguisher in 2000, and Dennis Wise breaking Callum Davidson's jaw in a row over a card game in 2002. Adams had previously initiated a crackdown in club discipline, {{going so far as}} to enforce random breathalyser tests. Adams said that [...] "in a lot of people's eyes, the players are guilty before they have had a fair trial – which is not the case". The incident also cast doubt over Adams' future at the club, as reports surfaced that he planned to quit the club. He did in fact offer his resignation, which was rejected by the club. However, he kept faith in his players' innocence, and claimed [...] "if they are guilty of anything it is of being unprofessional – of being drunk to excess". His faith was later vindicated when it transpired that all allegations against the players were false.|$|E

2500|$|The {{panel switch}} {{is an example}} of a power drive system, in that it used 1/16 {{horsepower}} motors to drive the selectors vertically to hunt for the desired connection, and <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>again</b> when the call was completed. In contrast, Strowger or crossbar systems used individual electromagnets for operation, and in their case the power available from an electromagnet limits the maximum size of the switch element it can move. [...] With Panel having no such restriction, its dimensions were determined solely by the needs of the switch, and the design of the exchange. The driving electric motor can be made as large as is necessary to move the switch elements. Thus, most calls required only about half as many stages as in earlier systems. Motors used on panel frames were capable of operating on alternating (AC) or direct current (DC), however they could only be started with DC. In the event of an AC power failure the motor would switch to its DC windings, and continue running until AC power was restored.|$|E
