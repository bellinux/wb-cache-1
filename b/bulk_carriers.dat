5|$|The 1980s and 1990s {{were a very}} unsafe {{time for}} <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers.</b> Many bulkers sank during this time, 99 were lost between 1990 and 1997 alone. Most of these sinkings were sudden and quick, making it {{impossible}} for the crew to escape: more than 650 sailors were lost during this same period. Due partly to the sinking of , a series of international safety resolutions regarding bulkers were adopted during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, bulkers were {{involved}} in an alarming number of shipwrecks. This led ship-owners to commission a study seeking to explain the effect of various factors on the crew's effectiveness and competence. The study showed that crew performance aboard <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> was the lowest of all groups studied. Among bulker crews, the best performance was found aboard younger and larger ships. Crews on better-maintained ships performed better, as did crews on ships where fewer languages were spoken.|$|E
5|$|Specialized <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> {{began to}} appear as steam-powered ships became more popular. The first steam ship {{recognized}} as a bulk carrier was the British coal carrier SS John Bowes in 1852. She featured a metal hull, a steam engine, and a ballasting system which used seawater instead of sandbags. These features helped her succeed in the competitive British coal market. The first self-unloader was the lake freighter Hennepin in 1902 on the Great Lakes. This greatly decreased the unloading time of bulkers by using conveyor belt to move the cargo. The first bulkers with diesel propulsion {{began to appear}} in 1911.|$|E

50|$|Kuzma Minin (Кузьма́ Ми́нин) is a <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier,</b> {{registered}} in Murmansk, Russia. The <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> delivers cargo around northern Europe, and visits ports such as Arkhangelsk, Gdańsk, Riga and Port Talbot. The name {{is given to}} commemorate Kuzma Minin, a hero of Russian resistance during the Time of Troubles.|$|R
5|$|Before {{specialized}} <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> existed, shippers had {{two methods}} to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{ships are}} removed from the fleet by going through {{a process known as}} ship {{breaking}} or scrapping. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship's empty weight (called light ton displacement or LDT) and prices in the scrap metal market. In 1998, almost 700ships were scrapped in places like Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is often done by 'beaching' the ship on open sand, then cutting it apart by hand with gas torches, a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million deadweight tons worth of <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year's scrapping. That year, bulkers fetched particularly high scrap prices, between $340 and $350 per LDT.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E

25|$|On 31 January 2012, the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China officially banned dry <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> with {{capacity}} exceeding 300,000 tons {{from entering}} Chinese ports {{in order to}} protect the domestic freight industry. Prior to this, only one of the new very large ore carrier chartered by Vale, Berge Everest, had unloaded Brazilian iron ore at a Chinese port — the ship arrived at Dalian on 28 December 2011 — but this was assumed to be a bureaucratic fluke as no Chinese port has regulatory approval to receive dry <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> of that size.|$|E

5|$|A <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier,</b> <b>bulk</b> freighter, or bulker is a {{merchant}} ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> {{was built in}} 1852, economic forces have fuelled {{the development of these}} ships, causing them to grow in size and sophistication. Today's bulkers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, efficiency, and durability.|$|R
25|$|The {{ground floor}} of the centre used a {{timeline}} consisting of a large model of the River Clyde containing 300 gallons of flowing water. The river went from a muddy stream, where in the 17th century you could wade across the Clyde at low tide, to the birthplace of ships great and small; through sail and steam and the great ocean liners, to today's warships and <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Discharge {{of cargo}} {{residues}} from <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> can pollute ports, waterways, and oceans. In many instances vessels intentionally discharge illegal wastes despite {{foreign and domestic}} regulation prohibiting such actions. It {{has been estimated that}} container ships lose over 10,000 containers at sea each year (usually during storms). Ships also create noise pollution that disturbs natural wildlife, and water from ballast tanks can spread harmful algae and other invasive species.|$|E
25|$|Bunkering at {{the port}} is {{currently}} carried out through the barge jetty in the extreme northern end of the Bharathi Dock. This is a 30m temporary facility with a draft of 2.5 to 3.0m.

However, the demand for bunker has outpaced the supply of infrastructure needed for bunkering in recent years.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} is classified by Det Norske Veritas with a class notation of +1A1, Pusher/Barge Unit, Ice IA+. It {{has the highest}} Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super, which means that {{it is designed to}} operate in difficult ice conditions mainly without icebreaker assistance. Thanks to the icebreaker bow and sloping sides, the combination could operate independently in level ice.

25|$|Valemax {{ships are}} {{a fleet of}} very large ore {{carriers}} (VLOC) owned or chartered by the Brazilian mining company Vale S.A. to carry iron ore from Brazil to European and Asian ports. With a capacity ranging from 380,000 to 400,000 tons deadweight, the vessels meet the Chinamax standard of ship measurements for limits on draft and beam. Valemax ships are the largest <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> ever constructed, when measuring deadweight tonnage or length overall, and are amongst the longest ships of any type currently in service.|$|E
