A <b>screw</b> at the <b>back</b> was <b>screwed</b> into the heel of the boot, and three small spikes at the front kept the skate steady. There were holes in the footstock for leather straps to fasten it to the foot. The metal blades were slightly higher at the back than the front. In the 1890s fen skaters started to race in Norwegian style skates.|$|R

50|$|The threads on a {{right-handed}} screw are a right-handed helix.

The manufactured paints had a balanced consistency that the artist could thin with oil, turpentine, or other mediums.|$|R
30|$|No {{intraoperative}} femoral {{shaft fracture}} was encountered in this study. There were three cases of lag screw cutout in the IM nail group (Table  3). The intramedullary nail {{was changed to}} a SHS in one case. For the other two cases, the proximal screw was removed under local anesthesia. Lag screw back-out occurred in three patients of this group. In one case, it was the superior, and in two cases, the inferior <b>screws</b> <b>backed</b> out 3 – 4  months postoperatively. However, fracture healing was not impaired and screws were removed 2  months later under local anesthesia without any further complications. There were no implant fractures in this study.|$|R

The Major was shrieking to it from behind, and I think that the {{creature}} {{thought that he was}} hallooing it on, so furiously did it rush. But I knew its name, and I thought that maybe that might give me the privileges of acquaintanceship; so as it came at me with bristling hair and its nose <b>screwed</b> <b>back</b> between its two red eyes, I cried out [...] "Bounder! Bounder!" [...] at the pitch of my lungs. It had its effect, for the beast passed me with a snarl, and flew along the path on the traces of Bonaventure de Lapp.|$|R

All I ask for is bare justice. Why can't you push steadily and evenly, instead of whizzing like a whirligig, and making me hot under all my collars?" [...] The thrust-block had six collars, each faced with brass, and he did not wish to get them heated.|$|R
50|$|The Deer gun {{was loaded}} by {{removing}} the barrel and placing a 9 mm cartridge in the chamber. The striker was then cocked, and a small plastic clip placed around the striker to impede the forward motion of the striker to prevent accidental discharge. The barrel was then <b>screwed</b> <b>back</b> onto the receiver. The gun was fired {{by removing the}} plastic clip, placing it on the barrel where it would become the sight, and pulling the trigger. At this point the user would take the victim's equipment if opportunity presented itself, and then flee. Later, the user would reload the gun by unscrewing the barrel and ejecting the spent case with the provided barrel rod, and follow the outlined procedure.|$|R

40|$|Proximal humerus {{fractures}} {{are among}} the most common fractures. Intramedullary nailing is a valuable treatment option for displaced fractures. The treatment aim is anatomic reduction and stable fixation allowing an early functional after treatment. In this study, we describe the technique of third-generation nailing, characterized by: straight nail, multiple angular stable proximal fixation options (aimed at the area of optimal bone quality), calcar screw, multiplanar (angular stable) distal fixation. Of the 35 fractures (7, two-fragment fractures; 16, three-fragment fractures; and 12, four-fragment fractures), we observed 2 losses of reduction, 3 screw penetrations, and 1 calcar <b>screw</b> <b>back</b> out. In 4 patients, this led to a second operation (1 reversed shoulder prosthesis, 3 removals of 1 screw). We conclude that third-generation is a valuable option in the treatment of 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -part fractures of the proximal humerus. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The main {{characteristic}} of stud earrings is {{the appearance of}} floating on the ear or earlobe without a visible (from the front) point of connection. Studs are invariably constructed {{on the end of}} a post, which penetrates straight through the ear or earlobe. The post is held in place by a removable friction back or clutch. A stud earring features a gemstone or other ornament mounted on a narrow post that passes through a piercing in the ear or earlobe, and is held in place by a fixture on the other side. Studs commonly come in the form of solitaire diamonds. Some stud earrings are constructed so that the post is threaded, allowing a <b>screw</b> <b>back</b> to hold the earring in place securely, which is useful in preventing the loss of expensive earrings containing precious stones, or made of precious metals.|$|R
50|$|Side error:This {{occurs when}} the horizon glass/mirror is not {{perpendicular}} to {{the plane of the}} instrument. To test for this, first zero the index arm then observe a star through the sextant. Then rotate the tangent <b>screw</b> <b>back</b> and forth so that the reflected image passes alternately above and below the direct view. If in changing from one position to another the reflected image passes directly over the unreflected image, no side error exists. If it passes to one side, side error exists. The user can hold the sextant on its side and observe the horizon to check the sextant during the day. If there are two horizons there is side error; adjust the horizon glass/mirror until the stars merge into one image or the horizons are merged into one. Side error is generally inconsequential for observations and can be ignored or reduced to a level that is merely inconvenient.|$|R
40|$|In vivo {{fluoroscopy}} is {{a well-known}} technique to analyze joint kinematics of the replaced knee. With this method, however, the contact areas between femoral and tibial components, fundamental for monitoring wear and validating design concepts, are hard to identify. We developed and tested a novel technique to assess condylar and post-cam contacts in TKA. The technique uses in vivo motion data of the replaced knee from standard fluoroscopy as input for finite element models of the prosthesis components. In these models, tibiofemoral contact patterns at the condyles and post-cam articulations were calculated during various activities. To test for feasibility, the technique was applied to a bicruciate posterior-stabilized prosthesis. Sensitivity of the finite element analysis, validation of the technique, and in vivo tests were performed. To test for potential in the clinical setting, five patients were preliminarily analyzed during chair rising-sitting, stair climbing, and step up-down. For each task and patient, the condylar contact points and contact line rotation were calculated. The results were repeatable and consistent with corresponding calculations from traditional fluoroscopic analysis. Specifically, natural knee kinematics, which shows rolling <b>back</b> and <b>screw</b> home, seemed replicated in all motor tasks. Post-cam contact was observed on both the anterior and posterior faces. Anterior contact is limited to flexion angle close to extension; posterior contact occurs in deeper flexion but {{is dependent on the}} motor task. The data suggest the proposed technique provides reliable information to analyze post-cam contacts. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
