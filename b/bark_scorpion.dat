50|$|Arizona <b>bark</b> <b>scorpions</b> have a {{gestation}} {{period of several}} months, are born live, and are gently guided onto their mother's back. The female usually gives birth to anywhere from 25 to 35 young. These remain with their mother until their first molt, which can be up to 3 weeks after birth. Arizona <b>bark</b> <b>scorpions</b> may live up to 6 years.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bark</b> <b>scorpions,</b> {{like most}} other scorpions, will glow when exposed to a blacklight.

50|$|The {{scorpions}} of Nevada {{are well}} represented by four main families: Buthidae, Caraboctonidae, Vaejovidae and the intriguingly named Superstitioniidae. Nevada has 23 species of scorpion, including the extremely common striped <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion.</b> Other species of scorpion include the giant desert hairy scorpion, Baja California <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> and Hadrurus spadix. Nevada's hot climate {{makes it an}} ideal state for certain spiders to live. Spiders include Carolina wolf spider, jumping spider, funnel-weaving spider, crab spider, black widow and tarantula.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bark</b> <b>scorpions</b> are flesh tone {{in color}} and very small making them {{difficult}} to detect especially on natural terrain (rocky land, multiple vegetation and soil textured land). They are not known to seek out people but look for places to hide unless provoked or defending their young.|$|R
50|$|Centruroides {{scorpions}} are {{unusual in}} that they are the only genus in the southwest that can climb walls, trees, and other objects with a sufficiently rough surface. <b>Bark</b> <b>scorpions</b> practice negative geotaxis, preferring an upside down orientation, which often results in people being stung due to the scorpion being on the underside of an object.|$|R
50|$|Arizona <b>bark</b> <b>scorpions</b> prefer {{riparian}} {{areas with}} mesquite, cottonwood, and sycamore groves, {{all of which}} have sufficient moisture and humidity to support insects and other prey species. The popularity of irrigated lawns, and other systems which increase environmental humidity in residential areas, has led to a massive {{increase in the number of}} these animals in some areas.|$|R
50|$|While {{nearly all}} {{scorpions}} are solitary, the Arizona <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> {{is a rare}} exception: during winter, packs of 20 to 30 scorpions can congregate.|$|E
50|$|In {{the arid}} regions {{inhabited}} {{by the southern}} grasshopper mouse, the Arizona <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> is plentiful and avoided by most predators because of the very painful sting it can inflict. The grasshopper mouse can feed on this scorpion with impunity even when the scorpion stings it repeatedly in the face. Researchers have found that a neural mechanism is involved that blocks the sending of pain messages to the brain. This mouse can normally feel pain from other sources, but can be temporarily insensitive to these stimuli after a dose of venom from a <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Centruroides {{gracilis}} is {{a species}} of scorpion in the family Buthidae, the bark scorpions. Its common names include Florida <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion,</b> brown <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion,</b> and slender brown scorpion. In Cuba it is known as alacran prieto ("dusky scorpion") and alacran azul ("blue scorpion"). It is native to northern parts of the middle Americas, including Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. It is present in other parts as an introduced species, including Cuba, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Jamaica, and Florida in the United States. It is also introduced in parts of Africa, including Cameroon and Gabon, {{as well as the}} Canary Islands.|$|E
5000|$|The {{southern}} grasshopper mouse or scorpion mouse (Onychomys torridus) is {{a species}} of the order Rodentia, {{and is in the}} family Cricetidae. It is found in Mexico and in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah in the United States. [...] Notable for its resistance to venom, it routinely kills and eats Arizona <b>bark</b> <b>scorpions,</b> a species with a highly venomous sting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bark</b> <b>{{scorpions}}</b> {{can easily}} find a crack or crevice to invade a home, {{as they can}} fit through any space thicker than a credit card. Glue boards are {{a good way to}} trap scorpions in the home. The best place to stick a glue board is along walls near points of entry to the home, such as doors or windows. Scorpions are known for having bad eyesight, so they tend to walk along walls. This method is great for homes with small children or pets, where using chemicals inside is not an option.|$|R
50|$|The Buthidae are {{the largest}} family of scorpions, {{containing}} about 80 genera and over 800 species as of mid-2008. Its members are known as, for example, fat-tailed <b>scorpions</b> and <b>bark</b> <b>scorpions.</b> A few very large genera (like Ananteris, Centruroides, Compsobuthus or Tityus) are known, but {{a high number of}} species-poor or monotypic ones also exist. New taxa are being described at a rate of several to several dozen new species per year. They occur in the warmer parts of every major landmass on Earth, except on New Zealand. Together with the Microcharmidae, the Buthidae make up the superfamily Buthoidea. The family was established by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1837.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> is nocturnal and {{prefers to}} ambush its prey, usually feeding on crickets, roaches, beetles, {{and other small}} insects. Bark {{scorpions}} can also be cannibalistic, occasionally feeding on a fellow scorpion.|$|E
50|$|The striped <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> (Centruroides vittatus) is an {{extremely}} common scorpion found throughout the midsection of the United States and northern Mexico. It {{is perhaps the most}} frequently encountered scorpion in the U.S.|$|E

40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{can result}} from sexual or ecological selective pressures, but the importance of alternative reproductive roles and trait compensation in generating phenotypic differences between the sexes is poorly understood. We evaluated morphological and behavioral sexual dimorphism in striped <b>bark</b> <b>scorpions</b> (Centruroides vittatus). We propose that reproductive roles have driven sexually dimorphic body mass in this species which produces sex differences in locomotor performance. Poor locomotor performance in the females (due to the burden of being gravid) favors compensatory aggression {{as part of an}} alternative defensive strategy, while male morphology is coadapted to support a sprinting-based defensive strategy. We tested the effects of sex and morphology on stinging and sprinting performance and characterized overall differences between the sexes in aggressiveness towards simulated threats. Greater body mass was associated with higher sting rates and slower sprinting within sexes, which explained the greater aggression of females (the heavier sex) and, along with longer legs in males, the improved sprint performance in males. These findings suggest females are aggressive to compensate for locomotor costs of reproduction while males possess longer legs to enhance sprinting for predator evasion and mate finding. Sexual dimorphism in the metasoma ("tail") was unrelated to stinging and sprinting performance and may best be explained by sexual selection...|$|R
40|$|For ectotherms, {{environmental}} temperatures influence numerous {{life history}} characteristics, {{and the body}} temperatures (Tb) selected by individuals can affect offspring fitness and parental survival. Reproductive trade-offs may therefore ensue for gravid females, because temperatures conducive to embryonic development may compromise females 2 ̆ 7 body condition. We tested whether reproduction influenced thermoregulation in female Arizona <b>Bark</b> <b>Scorpions</b> (Centruroides sculpturatus). We predicted that gravid females select higher Tb and thermoregulate more precisely than nonreproductive females. Gravid C. sculpturatus gain body mass throughout gestation, which exposes larger portions of their pleural membrane, possibly increasing their rates of transcuticular water loss in arid environments. Accordingly, we tested whether gravid C. sculpturatus lose water faster than nonreproductive females. We determined the preferred Tb of female scorpions in a thermal gradient and measured water loss rates using flow-through respirometry. Gravid females preferred significantly higher Tb than nonreproductive females, suggesting that gravid C. sculpturatus alter their thermoregulatory behaviour to promote offspring fitness. However, all scorpions thermoregulated with equal precision, perhaps because arid conditions create selective pressure on all females to thermoregulate effectively. Gravid females lost water faster than nonreproductive animals, indicating that greater exposure of the pleural membrane during gestation enhances the desiccation risk of reproductive females. Our findings suggest that gravid C. sculpturatus experience a trade-off, whereby selection of higher Tb and increased mass during gestation increase females 2 ̆ 7 susceptibility to water loss, and thus their mortality risk. Elucidating the mechanisms that influence thermal preferences may reveal how reproductive trade-offs shape the life history of ectotherms in arid environments...|$|R
