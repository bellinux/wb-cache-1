A constant ratio of strain C 3 colonies did not excrete glutamate. These colonies were subcultured, and colonial analysis of their descendants established that the change from non-excretor to excretor (Sg− → Sg+) is a spontaneous and random process with occurs at a high rate, and that an equilibrium state results from the back-transition Sg+ → Sg− in large populations. Acridine orange, ethidium bromide, and shaking have a strong influence on Sg+-to-Sg− interconversion, which suggests that a genetic element like an episome is implicated (<b>S</b> <b>factor).</b> Various auxotrophic mutants of bacterial strain C 3 have been cured of the <b>S</b> <b>factor.</b> Strains lacking the <b>S</b> <b>factor</b> (S− strains) do not excrete glutamate and lose their fermentative metabolism completely.

Both one- and many-body contributions to the nuclear current operator are included. The former retain for the first time, besides the 1 /m leading order contribution (m is the nucleon mass), also the next-to-leading order term, proportional to 1 /m 3. The many-body currents are constructed {{in order to satisfy}} the current conservation relation with the adopted Hamiltonian model.
