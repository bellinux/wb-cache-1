The presence of silt in water erodes the turbine material. Erosion of turbine decreases the performance of turbine, life of the turbine as well as loss of power generation. This paper presents a new approach for the study of silt erosion of hydro turbine. In this study, weight of eroded material of turbine have been determined by employing criterion of plastic strain which include parameters (silt size, silt hardness, concentration of silt, flow velocity, hardness of turbine material) affecting silt erosion of turbine. Results have been verified with experimental work for Pelton turbine having 16 buckets made up of <b>brass</b> <b>material.</b> It is seen that the results of analytical study matches with the experimental work.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{electrical}} discharge machining (EDM) includes thermal erosion of the workpiece {{by a series of}} sparks from an electrode depending on electrical source of energy. The workpiece and the electrode are submerged in a dielectric fluid. This paper presents an experimental investigation for studying the effect of electrodes shape using (flat, conical, and round) bottoms, currents of (10, 20, and 42 A), pulse duration of (25, 50, and 75 µs) and pulse interval of (37, 12, and 3. 5 µs) on electrode wear rate (EWR). A series of experiments was carried out using 27 specimens, workpiece of AISI 1060 steel material with thickness of 2 mm, electrode of extra high leaded <b>brass</b> <b>material</b> with diameter of 16 mm, and transformer oil as dielectric liquid.

30|$|For the metal-working industry, a {{continuous}} reduction in manufacturing cost is desirable. An important issue related to reduce overall cost {{consists of the}} removal of undesirable or excess work piece material during the machining process. Among different types of material removal operations, end-milling is most important common milling operation due to its capability of producing complex geometric surfaces with reasonable accuracy and surface finish. Over the last two decades, several works focused on the optimum selection of machining parameters based on various criteria such as using basic mathematical models. Some contemporary literature is first presented. Brito et al. (2014) developed a robust parameter design for the process parameters using the multi-objective methods. The numerical results are validated with the experimental cutting tests. Mathivanan et al. (2016) studied the influence of cutting parameters on milling of the composite materials. A CNC end milling was used to machine the composite laminates at various combinations of speeds and depth of cuts. Numan durakbasa et al. (2015) presented the various end milling process parameters {{as well as the}} coatings on the surface quality of the machined parts of AISI H 13 hot work steel. Some researchers (eg., Hocheng et al. (1997), Arokiadass (2012) and Surinder (2015)) investigated the machining characteristics of an aluminium based composite alloy for the end-milling process. Experiments were conducted based on the central composite design and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to build the mathematical model. Zhang et al. (2016) implemented a systematic optimization approach to obtain the pareto-optimal values of cutting process parameters. Dikshit et al. (2014 a, 2014 b) studied the cutting process parameters in dry machining of aluminium alloys. Response surface methodology was planned to carry out the experiments and further genetic algorithms were implemented to obtain the optimal parameters such as the cutting speed, feed per tooth, axial and radial depth of cut. Karkalos et al. (2016) focused on the machining of Titanium alloy with the peripheral down milling process and further optimal control studies were implemented to minimize the surface roughness. Ratnam et al. (2016) studied the turn-milling process in tangential and orthogonal directions to minimize the surface roughness of extruded <b>brass</b> <b>material.</b> Several recent works focussed on the optimal machining parameters for multi-pass milling operations by considering the statistical and artificial intelligent techniques (Wang et al. 2005; Sukumar et al. 2014; Venkata Rao and Pawar 2010; Das et al. 2016; Ren et al. 2016). The efficiency of a neural network model was estimated by conducting the numerical simulations and experiments. Several studies had been focussed on the optimization of important cutting process parameters using intelligent optimization techniques like genetic algorithms and radial basis neural networks (Briceno et al. 2002; Mounayri et al. 2010; Mounayri et al. 2005). Using, different neural network models and optimization algorithms the impact of the surface roughness on the process parameters are extensively studied (Palanisamy et al. 2007; Palanisamy and Kalidass 2014; Zain et al. 2011; Saffar and Razfar 2010). Khorasani et al. (2016) studied the effects of cutting parameters and cutting fluid pressure intensity on the surface roughness of milled parts. The important parameters were modelled and analysed using both the multi-layer perceptron and radial basis neural networks.|$|E

A Nd:Glass laser (Twinkle Light Conversion, λ[*]=[*] 527 [*]nm at 250 [*]fs) {{and a set}} of bronze and brass certified standards were used. The inverse Calibration-Free method (inverse CF-LIBS) was applied for estimating the temperature of the fs laser induced plasma in order to achieve quantitative elemental analysis of such materials.

With this aim the capability of the here adopted inverse CF-LIBS method, which is based on the fulfilment of the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) condition, for an indirect determination of the species excitation temperature, is shown.
