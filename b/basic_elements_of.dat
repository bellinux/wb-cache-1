5|$|Modern {{research}} on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, {{partly because of the}} variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.|$|E
5|$|Spacetimes are the arenas {{in which}} all {{physical}} events take place—an event is a point in spacetime specified by its time and place. The <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> spacetime are events. In any given spacetime, an event is a unique position at a unique time. Because events are spacetime points, in classical relativistic physics, the location of an elementary (point-like) particle {{at a particular time}} can be written as (x, y, z, t). A spacetime is the union of all events {{in the same way that}} a line is the union of all of its points, formally organized into a manifold.|$|E

2500|$|As aural/oral {{learning}} {{is the most}} <b>basic</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> discrimination learning, generalization is the <b>basic</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> inference learning. Generalization consists aural/oral learning, verbal learning, symbolic reading, and writing. At the generalization level of learning, students may listen to sets of familiar and unfamiliar tonal or rhythmic patterns and determine whether the patterns are the same or different, ultimately reading familiar and unfamiliar patterns, as well.|$|R

5|$|All spoken {{languages}} have phonemes of {{at least}} two different categories, vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables. As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called suprasegmental. Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes. In sign languages, the equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by the <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.|$|E
5|$|Wipeout 3 is {{a racing}} game that retains the same <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> its predecessors, and {{introduces}} players to the F7200 Anti-Gravity Race League. Set in 2116, Players control futuristic anti-gravity ships owned by racing corporations and pilot them on eight circuits (plus four hidden prototype tracks). Each craft {{is equipped with}} an energy shield that absorbs damage sustained on the track; if the shield is disabled, the player's craft can be knocked out of the race. Shields are regenerated in a pit lane that is set apart from the main course. The less {{time spent in the}} pit lane, the less the shield will regenerate.|$|E
5|$|This {{brings the}} issue of the mysterious origin of the Wielbark culture, and why it so {{immediately}} replaced the Oksywie culture. According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes, the ancestors of that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia (under King Berig) in two boatloads and landed on the South Baltic shores, followed by a third boat carrying the ancestors of the Gepids. Supposedly they conquered the native people of that region, and then, some years later (under King Filimer, the fifth one counting from Berig), continued their migration toward the Black Sea. This story, in the past dismissed, is now seen as containing <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the true sequence of events and the Wielbark culture is in part identified with Germanic ancestors of the Goths indeed. The idea of an arrival in the mouth of the Vistula region of culturally different (although related) people, who mixed with the Oksywie culture population, and being more advanced possibly dominated it (at least culturally) to some degree, is not at odds with the state of archeological findings and may explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 AD.|$|E

25|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> melody are pitch, duration, rhythm, and tempo. The {{tones of}} a melody are usually drawn from pitch {{systems such as}} scales or modes. Melody may consist, to {{increasing}} degree, of the figure, motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and period or sentence. The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.|$|E
25|$|The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Clarify Some Issues About the So-Called Psychopathic Personality is a {{book written}} by American {{psychiatrist}} Hervey M.

The text {{is considered to be}} a seminal work and the most influential clinical description of psychopathy in the twentieth century.

25|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> art—the line, {{particle}} of color—like {{words could}} be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. The line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an calculable abstract value, {{in addition to}} the particles of color and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim, something Divisionists like the Metzinger would push to the extreme, would have a lasting affect on the works produced in the coming years by Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and Gino Severini.|$|E
25|$|Monodisperse powders of {{colloidal}} silica, for example, {{may therefore}} be stabilized sufficiently {{to ensure a}} high degree of order in the colloidal crystal or polycrystalline colloidal solid which results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established. Such defective polycrystalline structures would appear to be the <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> nanoscale materials science, and, therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms involved in microstructural evolution in inorganic systems such as sintered ceramic nanomaterials.|$|E

25|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> hip-hop—boasting raps, rival posses, uptown throwdowns, and {{political}} commentary—were all present in Trinidadian music {{as long ago}} as the 1800s, though they did not reach the form of commercial recordings until the 1920s and 30s. Calypso like other forms of music continued to evolve through the 50s and 60s. When rocksteady and reggae bands looked to make their music a form of national and even international black resistance, they took calypso's example. Calypso itself, like Jamaican music, moved {{back and forth between the}} predominance of boasting and toasting songs packed with 'slackness' and sexual innuendo and a more topical, political, 'conscious' style.|$|E
25|$|The khachkars {{created by}} the carver Pavgos in Goshavank stand out among the rest. The best {{of them is a}} 1291 khachkar with the maker’s name carved in the bottom left star, {{which is one of the}} most {{intricate}} examples in existence. The finely carved lacy ornaments are arranged in layers in which the <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the composition — a cross on a shield-shaped rosette and eight-pointed Starr filling the corners of the middle-cross section—show clearly. The intricate openwork ornaments vary — a clear-cut geometrical pattern constitutes the background, and the accentuating elements form a complicated combination of a floral and geometrical ornament which never repeats itself.|$|E
25|$|In a 1976 {{published}} essay, the psychiatrists Colin Martindale, Nancy Hasenfus, and Dwight Hines (University of Maine) {{suggested that}} Hitler had {{suffered from a}} sub-function of the left hemisphere of the brain. They referred to the tremor of his left limbs, his tendency for leftward eye movements and the alleged missing of the left testicle. They believed that Hitler’s behavior was dominated by his right cerebral hemisphere, a situation that resulted in symptoms such as a tendency to the irrational, auditory hallucinations, and uncontrolled outbursts. Martindale, Hasenfus and Hines even suspected that {{the dominance of the}} right hemisphere contributed to the two <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> Hitlers political ideology: antisemitism and Lebensraum ideology.|$|E
