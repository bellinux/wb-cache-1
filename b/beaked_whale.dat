5|$|A <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> is any of {{at least}} 22 species of small whale in the family Ziphiidae. They {{are one of the}} least-known {{families}} of large mammals: several species have only been described in the last two decades, and it is entirely possible that more remain as yet undiscovered. Six genera have been identified.|$|E
5|$|Ziphiids {{consist of}} 22 species of <b>beaked</b> <b>whale.</b> These vary from size, to coloration, to distribution, {{but they all}} share a similar hunting style. They use a suction technique, aided {{by a pair of}} grooves on the {{underside}} of their head, not unlike the throat pleats on the rorquals, to feed.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{other species}} are {{encountered}} only accidentally, or so rarely in Canadian territory {{that it is}} impossible to tell whether they are permanent resident. Most of these species are cetaceans, some generally poorly known: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), the dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and K. breviceps), Blainville's and True's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon densirostris and M. mirus), the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). The big free-tailed and evening bats (respectively Nyctinomops macrotis and Nycticeius humeralis), as well as the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) are found mostly in areas south of the U.S.-Canada frontier, and occasionally in Canada.|$|E
50|$|These {{features}} are also common with other larger <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> especially the Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine group size of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> due to their inconspicuous surfacing behavior. Groups of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> defined as all individuals found in the same location at the same time, have been reported as ranging from one to 100 individuals. Nevertheless, some populations' group size has been estimated from repeated observations. For example, northern and southern bottlenose whales (H. ampullatus and H. planifrons), Cuvier's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> and Blainville's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> (Mesoplodon densirostris) have a reported maximum group size of 20 individuals, with the average ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 individuals. Berardius species and Longman's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> (Indopacetus pacificus) are found in larger groups of up to 100 individuals.|$|R
50|$|Longman's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> {{and other}} <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> - Being one of newly {{classified}} and less known species, their overall distributions have been rather unclear. They are {{the second largest}} of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> and third largest of toothed whales {{can be seen in}} Chinese EEZ. In Chinese waters, either live or deceased records were concentrated on east coast of Taiwan and surrounding waters including Lanyu and Green Island. Based on studies, presences of other <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> being lesser known as well, have been confirmed to be common around Taiwanese waters, and Taiwan is one of fewer locations where <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> have been observed with higher regularities during whale watching tours. Stejneger's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> are resident in Sea of Japan, {{and one of the most}} commonly recorded ziphiidae species of the Korean Peninsula although their presence within Yellow Sea is rather unclear.|$|R
5|$|The whale ear has {{specific}} {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> for example has a small bulge {{sitting on top of}} its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.|$|E
25|$|A study {{finds that}} Cuvier's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> {{is capable of}} diving {{to a depth of}} 3.2km and staying under water for 137 minutes, both records for a mammal.|$|E
25|$|Cuvier is commemorated in {{the naming}} of several animals; they include Cuvier's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (which he first thought to be extinct), Cuvier's gazelle, Cuvier's toucan, Cuvier's bichir, Cuvier's dwarf caiman, Galeocerdo cuvier (tiger shark), and Anolis cuvieri, a lizard from Puerto Rico. There also are some extinct animals named after Cuvier, such as the South American giant sloth Catonyx cuvieri.|$|E
40|$|<b>Beaked</b> <b>whales</b> have mass {{stranded}} {{during some}} naval sonar exercises, but {{the cause is}} unknown. They are difficult to sight but can reliably be detected by listening for echolocation clicks produced during deep foraging dives. Listening for these clicks, we documented Blainville's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> Mesoplodon densirostris, in a naval underwater range where sonars are in regular use near Andros Island, Bahamas. An array of bottom-mounted hydrophones can detect <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> when they click anywhere within the range. We used two complementary methods to investigate behavioral responses of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> to sonar: an opportunistic approach that monitored whale responses to multi-day naval exercises involving tactical mid-frequency sonars, and an experimental approach using playbacks of simulated sonar and control sounds to whales tagged with a device that records sound, movement, and orientation. Here we show that in both exposure conditions <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> stopped echolocating during deep foraging dives and moved away. During actual sonar exercises, <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> were primarily detected near {{the periphery of the}} range, on average 16 km away from the sonar transmissions. Once the exercise stopped, <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> gradually filled {{in the center of the}} range over 2 - 3 days. A satellite tagged whale moved outside the range during an exercise, returning over 2 - 3 days post-exercise. The experimental approach used tags to measure acoustic exposure and behavioral reactions of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> to one controlled exposure each of simulated military sonar, killer whale calls, and band-limited noise. The <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> reacted to these three sound playbacks at sound pressure levels below 142 dB re 1 ÂµPa by stopping echolocation followed by unusually long and slow ascents from their foraging dives. The combined results indicate similar disruption of foraging behavior and avoidance by <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> in the two different contexts, at exposures well below those used by regulators to define disturbance...|$|R
5000|$|Not much {{information}} is available about group composition of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> Only three species have been studied in any detail: northern bottlenose <b>whales,</b> Blainville's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> and Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> Female northern bottlenose whales appear to form a loose network of social partners with no obvious long-term associations. In contrast to females, some male northern bottlenose whales have been repeatedly recorded together over several years, and possibly form long-term associations. Studies of Blainville's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> have revealed groups usually consist {{of a number of}} females, calves, and/or juvenile animals. These whales are assumed to live in [...] "harem-like" [...] groups, where several females and young are accompanied by a single male. [...] Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> are known to occur in multiple male groups, and in large groups consisting of adult animals of both sexes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Beaked</b> <b>whales</b> are {{the members}} of the family Ziphiidae, which {{consists}} of 22 species. These toothed whales are notable for their elongated beaks. Among air-breathing animals, <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> {{are some of the most}} extreme divers: Cuvier's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> regularly dive for an hour at a depth over 1000 m, and the longest and deepest foraging dive recorded is 137.5 minutes at 2992 m. This is the greatest dive-depth known for a mammal.|$|R

In whales, and other marine mammals, no great difference exists between the outer and inner environments.

The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high-frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression.

500|$|White sharks also attack {{dolphins}} and porpoises from above, behind {{or below}} {{to avoid being}} detected by their echolocation. Targeted species include dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops ssp.), Humpback dolphins (Sousa ssp.), harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli). Groups of dolphins have occasionally been observed defending themselves from sharks with mobbing behaviour. White shark predation on other species of small cetacean has also been observed. In August 1989, a [...] juvenile male pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) was found stranded in central California with a bite mark on its caudal peduncle from a great white shark. In addition, white sharks attack and prey upon beaked whales. Cases where an adult Stejneger's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon stejnegeri), with a mean mass of around , and a juvenile Cuvier's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Ziphius cavirostris), an individual estimated at , were hunted and killed by great white sharks have also been observed. When hunting sea turtles, they appear to simply bite through the carapace around a flipper, immobilizing the turtle. The heaviest species of bony fish, the oceanic sunfish (Mola mola), {{has been found in}} great white shark stomachs.|$|E
40|$|Observations of {{killer whales}} (Orcinus orca) feeding on {{the remains of}} <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> have been {{previously}} documented; however, to date, {{there has been no}} published account of killer whales actively preying upon <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> This article describes the first field observations of killer whales interacting with, hunting and preying upon <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> (Mesoplodon spp.) on four separate occasions during 2014, 2015 and 2016 in the Bremer Sub-Basin, off the south coast of Western Australia...|$|R

5000|$|Current {{research}} reveals {{two species}} of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> are most affected by sonar: Cuvier's (Z. cavirostris) and Blainville's (M. densirostris) <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> These animals have been reported as stranding in correlation with military exercises in Greece, the Bahamas, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. [...] The livers of these animals had the most damage.|$|R
500|$|The rabbit {{population}} {{can grow}} {{to a level}} at which their grazing and burrowing adversely affects the fragile dune vegetation. When rabbit numbers are reduced by myxomatosis, the plants recover, although those that are toxic to rabbits, like ragwort, then become less common due to increased competition from the edible species. The rabbits may be killed by carnivores such as red foxes, weasels and stoats. Records of [...] mammals that are rare in the NNR area include red deer swimming in the haven, a hedgehog and a beached Sowerby's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale.</b>|$|E

500|$|Aquariums {{have tried}} housing {{other species of}} whales in captivity. The success of belugas turned {{attention}} to maintaining their relative, the narwhal, in captivity. However, in repeated attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, all narwhals kept in captivity died within months. A pair of pygmy right whales were retained in an enclosed area (with nets); they were eventually released in South Africa. There was one attempt to keep a stranded Sowerby's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> calf in captivity; the calf rammed into the tank wall, breaking its rostrum, which resulted in death. It was thought that Sowerby's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> evolved to swim fast in a straight line, and a [...] tank was not big enough. There have been attempts to keep baleen whales in captivity. There were three attempts to keep grey whales in captivity. Gigi was a grey whale calf that died in transport.

40|$|Abstract: A {{combined}} {{visual and}} acoustic survey for <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> was conducted over a three week period in August, September 2008 in the Coral Sea off the east Australia. The survey area {{is used for}} naval exercises and the survey {{was intended as a}} trial of methods of detection of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> for the purpose of determining their distribution across the area. Two types of acoustic system were used: a towed array with four closely spaced hydrophones and two autonomous drifting recording systems with hydrophones suspended to 400 m depth. Water depths in the area vary from 300 m to more than 3, 500 m. Data were sampled at 300 kHz (towed array) and 192 kHz (drifting recorders) and recorded on computer hard disks. Data were analysed using a range of acoustic analysis software, automated using matched filter techniques. Preliminary results have found many detections of acoustic signals with similar wave form, frequency range, frequency sweep, number of cycles and repetition rate as those reported for <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> in the northern hemisphere. Thousands of clicks typical of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> have been counted, compared with only six sightings of 12 individual <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> Higher densities of detections were found in areas of steep bathymetric slopes than over the deep plains...|$|R
