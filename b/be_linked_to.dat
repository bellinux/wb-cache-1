40|$|Purpose: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} of {{a significant relationship between}} systemic markers of renal and vascular function (processes <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> cardiovascular disease and its development) and retinal microvascular function in diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. Methods: Ocular microcirculatory function was measured in 116 patients with diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease using static and continuous retinal vessel responses to three cycles of flickering light. Endothelial function was evaluated by von Willebrand factor (vWf), endothelial microparticles and soluble E selectin, renal function by serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). HbA 1 c was used as a control index. Results: Central retinal vein equivalence and venous maximum dilation <b>to</b> flicker <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> HbA 1 c (both p< 0. 05). Arterial reaction time <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> serum creatinine (p= 0. 036) and eGFR (p= 0. 039), venous reaction time <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> creatinine clearance (p= 0. 018). Creatinine clearance and eGFR <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> arterial maximum dilatation (p< 0. 001 and p= 0. 003 respectively) and the dilatation amplitude (p= 0. 038 and p= 0. 048 respectively) responses in the third flicker cycle. Of venous responses to the first flicker cycle, HbA 1 c <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the maximum dilation response (p= 0. 004) and dilatation amplitude (p= 0. 017), vWf <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the maximum constriction response (p= 0. 016), and creatinine clearance to the baseline diameter fluctuation (p= 0. 029). In the second flicker cycle, dilatation amplitude <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> serum creatinine (p= 0. 022). Conclusions: Several retinal blood vessel responses <b>to</b> flickering light <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> glycaemia and renal function, but only one index <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> endothelial function. Renal function must be considered when interpreting retinal vessel responses...|$|R

5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|Hanoi, {{which had}} {{continuously}} stipulated {{that it would}} not conduct negotiations while the bombing continued, finally agreed to meet with the Americans for preliminary talks in Paris.

Although the bombing halt was to <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> progress in the peace talks, the Joint Chiefs were skeptical that the administration would reopen the bombing campaign under any circumstances. They were correct. North Vietnam was not the target of intense bombing again for another three and half years.|$|E
