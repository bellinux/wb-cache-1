Cells are {{fabricated}} {{in an industrial}} like environment; the interconnection tabs are applied by bonding a conductive adhesive film; modules are made with an industrial type laminator. To our knowledge these are the first modules made from cells with this architecture. The main benefits of this module structure are that the conductive film used for <b>bonding</b> the <b>tabbing</b> is completely lead free, already fulfilling now future RoHS standards (restriction of hazardous substances). Additionally, the cells are completely boron-free which guarantees stable efficiencies when exposed to light. We evaluate different interconnection schemes focusing on the rear side. For that purpose the already fired Al paste on the rear is locally abrased and an interconnection tab is applied by conductive film bonding. With this simple method shunting of the Al emitter has been avoided and the interconnection of cells to strings can be realised with one less process step as compared to conventional p-type Al BSF cell production. Using the above mentioned cells and methods we produced one-cell-modules to prove stable cell interconnection. Individual cells are characterised with IV measurements after co-firing, with <b>bonded</b> <b>tabbing</b> and as a one-cell-module. Finally we performed climate chamber tests. Three modules with different rear architecture are used for damp heat tests and another two for temperature cycle tests (according to DIN EN 61215).

Tensile strength was analyzed by conducting tensile tests per ASTM D 3039. Tensile coupons were cut to 254 mm long by 25. 4 mm wide. Tabs were constructed from 1. 6 mm thick GFRP printed circuit board material. A commercial grade two part epoxy was used to <b>bond</b> the <b>tabs</b> to the CFSMC. Tensile results were inconclusive due to consistent fractures occurring outside the gauge lengths of the specimens. Flexure strength was analyzed by conducting 3 -point bend tests per ASTM D 790. ASTM D 790 calls for a larger than normal support span-to-coupon thickness ratio of 32 : 1 for high strength composites. The support span was therefore set to 42. 6 mm.

40|$|Mismatch between outer lead bonds (OLBs) of a tape {{automated}} <b>bonding</b> (<b>TAB)</b> and a {{glass panel}} during fabrication is studied using the finite element method. A two-dimensional finite element model for the TAB-on Glass (TOG) connector is presented for determining the deformation of the connector. The deformation of the TOG connector induced by residual thermal stresses are determined via a two-stage approach. At the first stage, the TOG connector is under heat and pressure.

The deformations of the connector at the two stages are determined in the finite element analysis in which the temperature dependence of material properties is considered. Effects of particular parameters on the mismatch between the OLBs are studied by means of a number of numerical examples.

40|$|The Boeing Company has {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} Tape Automated <b>Bonding</b> (<b>TAB)</b> and Surface Mount Technology (SMT) for a highly reliable, low cost interconnect for concentrator solar cell arrays. TAB and SMT are currently used in the electronics industry for chip interconnects and printed circuit board assembly. TAB tape consists of sixty-four 3 -mil/ 1 -oz tin-plated copper leads on 8 -mil centers. The leads are thermocompression gang bonded to GaAs concentrator solar cell with silver contacts. This bond, known as an Inner Lead Bond (ILB), allows for pretesting and sorting capability via nondestruct wire bond pull and flash testing. Destructive wire pull tests resulted in preferred mid-span failures. Improvements in fill factor were attributed to decreased contact resistance on TAB bonded cells. Preliminary thermal cycling and aging tests were shown excellent bond strength and metallurgical results. Auger scans of bond sites reveals an Ag-Cu-Tin composition. Improper bonds are identified through flash testing as a performance degradation. On going testing of cells are underway at Lewis Research Center. SMT techniques are utilized to excise and form TAB leads post ILB. The formed leads' shape isolates thermal mismatches between the cells and the flex circuit they are mounted on. TABed cells are picked and placed with a gantry x-y-z positioning system with pattern recognition.

Both test methods provide a nearly pure shear stress state in the shear plane and are therefore suitable for determination of the mechanical properties under shear load. Different notch opening angles with θ = 0 ° or θ = 110 ° and sample sizes for both methods are discussed. For strain measurement, strain gauge rosettes are applied on two sides of the test specimens.

The {{goal was to}} provide a management tool for making yield projections, resource allocations, understanding operating practices, and performing what-if analyses. The model was developed using a series of case studies of packages entering manufacturing. These studies were a tape carrier package (TCP) at Intel, Chandler, AZ, a ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) and plastic quad flat pack (PQFP) at IBM, Bromont, P.

These packages covered a wide range of technologies, including liquid and overmolded encapsulation, wirebond and controlled collapsed chip connection (C 4) chip connections, and tape automated <b>bonding</b> (<b>TAB),</b> ceramic, laminate, and leadframe substrates. The factors that affect yield learning rates (e. g. process complexity, production volumes, personnel experience) were identified and a nonlinear spreadsheet-based response surface model was built. The model separates out the underlying chronic yield from excursions due to human error, equipment failure, etc. The model has been shown to accurately predict the yield ramp {{as a function of the}} factor values. One of the conclusions of this work is that all of the very dissimilar assembly processes had very similar factors, with very similar factor sensitivities and rankings in terms of how each affected the yield learning rate. In all cases, the most important factors were operator experience, changes in line volume, types of work teams, process complexity, equipment upgrades, and technology type.

These studies span the wavelength region of 30 - 200 microns and include development of focal planes and electronics that would utilize them. Efforts reported here represent collaborations among the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory; Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories (LBL); and the University of California at Berkeley. The overall goal of this program is to demonstrate extremely high performance detectors for low background applications between 30 - 200 microns. For the 40 - 120 micron region, the program is developing a 32 x 32 filled detector array. Previous work has demonstrated the required performance with a Z-Plane array architecture; we are now upgrading construction facilities and techniques to increase yields and reliability. We have completed the initial tradeoff analysis for the interconnects between the detectors and and readouts. We found satisfactory performance for both Flex-Cable and Tape Automated <b>Bonding</b> (<b>TAB)</b> devices, but analysis showed that an all-sapphire device would not meet our requirements. In addition, the effort continued to develop readouts that can operate close to the detector element temperature; success would substantially improve the manufacturability of the arrays.

40|$|A new {{specimen}} {{design for}} determining the compression strength of thick unidirectional laminate composites has been developed using finite element simulations and validated by experimental testing. The computational models included parts of the testing fixture. The materials used for experiments were carbon fibre/epoxy T 300 / 914 from Hexcel Composites and IM 7 / 8552. An understanding has been developed to explain why, using the standard, parallel sided design, for testing specimens in compression and using the ICSTM fixture, specimens using a laminate thicker than 2 mm do not fail in an acceptable way. Initially, simulation and experimental parametric {{studies were carried out}} to investigate the effects of loading and design conditions on the fixture and specimen in order to change the stress distribution in the 2 mm thick, parallel sided, 10 mm x 10 mm gauge section specimen. In addition, in order to optimise the specimen itself, different adhesives for <b>bonding</b> end <b>tabs</b> to the laminate were investigated, as were the end tab design and material used in their manufacture. Subsequent simulations showed that the use of an extended and waisted gauge length of either circular or s-shaped profile both caused thick laminate specimens to fail close to the centre of the gauge length. The predicted strength being similar to that measured for a 2 mm thick, parallel sided specimen using the optimised design. Experimental compression strength data from thick laminate specimens with the circular and s-shaped profiles machined into the gauge section validated the finite element results; the strengths achieved being almost identical to those for the 2 mm thick laminates.

In this research, the standard test method of ASTM D 638 M- 89 is used to prepare specimens as per the dimensions for testing tensile properties of fiber-resin composites. The test specimen has a constant cross section with <b>tabs</b> <b>bonded</b> at the ends. The specimens were incorporated with borassus flabellifer fiber. Five identical specimens were prepared for each weight by varying fiber content in grams i. e. 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5. Tensile strength of fabricated composites increases with increase in weight of fiber. The tensile properties of pure polyesters are also determined experimentally. The tensile strength of pure polyester is 35. 2 N/mm. The tensile strength of a fibered composite is 64. 51 N/mm 2 (for maximum loading fiber that is at 2. 5 grams) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{describes a}} process for the shaping of electrically conducting terminal bumps on electrically conducting microelectronic connecting elements. In conventional processes, a terminal bump is produced in a deep-draw process, whereby the connecting element is pressed by a die into a recess of a substrate on which the connecting element is fixed. The disadvantage is that a recess occurs next to the terminal bump on the side facing the die, said recess being deleterious for the mechanical loading capability and also for subsequent <b>tab</b> <b>bonding.</b> In the process according to the invention, however, a shaping tool is pressed onto part of {{the surface of a}} connecting element, whereby one or more terminal bumps are formed by the plastic deformation of the connecting element material {{in this part of the}} surface due to the geometry of the shaping tool, however, the connecting element suffers no further deformation outside said part of the surface. The advantages of the process according t o the invention are that no shaping substrate matched to the desired terminal bumps is required, that conventional wire bonding units can be used, that the process is fast, low-priced and precise and that the mechanical loading capability of a connecting element, in particular a metal lead, is [...] due to the formation. ...|$|R
