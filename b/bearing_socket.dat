40|$|This {{review is}} an attempt to untangle the {{complexity}} of transtibial prosthetic socket fit, determine the most important characteristic for a successful fitting, and perhaps find some indication of whether a particular prosthetic socket type might be best for a given situation. Further, it is intended to provide directions for future research. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and used medical subject headings and standard key words to search for articles in relevant databases. No restrictions were made on study design or type of outcome measure. From the obtained search results (n = 1, 863), 35 articles were included. The relevant data were entered into a predefined data form that incorporated the Downs and Black risk of bias assessment checklist. Results for the qualitative outcomes (n = 19 articles) are synthesized. Total surface <b>bearing</b> <b>sockets</b> lead to greater activity levels and satisfaction in active persons with amputation, those with a traumatic cause of amputation, and younger persons with amputation than patellar tendon <b>bearing</b> <b>sockets.</b> Evidence on vacuum-assisted suction and hydrostatic sockets is inadequate, and further studies are much needed. To improve the scientific basis for prescription, comparison of and correlation between mechanical properties of interface material, socket designs, user characteristics, and outcome measures should be conducted and reported in future studies...|$|R

40|$|Mixed {{and fluid}} film {{lubrication}} characteristics of hydrostatic spherical bearings for swash-plate-type axial piston pumps and motors are studied theoretically under non-steady-state conditions. The basic equations incorporating interference and contact of surface roughness are derived fundamentally through {{combination of the}} GW and PC models. Furthermore, a programming code that is applicable to the caulked-socket-type and open-socket-type bearings is developed. Effects of caulking, operating conditions, and the bearing dimension on {{the motion of the}} sphere and tribological performance of the bearings are examined. Salient conclusions are the following: The spheres eccentricity increases in the low supply pressure period. The time-lag of the load change engenders greater motion of the sphere. Caulking of the <b>bearing</b> <b>socket</b> suppresses the spheres motion. The bearing stiffness increases and power loss decreases for smaller recess angles. Minimum power loss is given under the condition that the <b>bearing</b> <b>socket</b> radius nearly equals the equivalent load radius...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} the general activity over one week and detailed activity during a 24 -hour period, of 48 established unilateral transtibial prostheses users. Activity {{was measured by}} instrumenting their prescribed prosthesis, {{which they have been}} using for a minimum of 6 month, with the ActivPAL™ activity monitor. Half (n= 24) were fitted with a prostheses with total surface <b>bearing</b> (TSB) pressure-cast <b>sockets</b> (Hands-off) and the other half (n= 24) had been wearing prostheses with hand-cast (Hands-on) patella tendon <b>bearing</b> (PTB) <b>sockets.</b> As a prerequisite, the long-term reliability of the ActivPAL™ activity monitor was assessed and it was found to exhibit a high level of consistency between devices (Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0. 997 over a 24 -hour period). The monitors were utilized to examine the activity levels of two groups of transtibial prostheses users wearing their own prosthesis. Results indicated that both subject groups were active throughout the day, walking on average over 8, 000 steps. No statistically significant difference in daily stepping activity was seen between the two groups (p= 0. 173).

40|$|The {{quality of}} fit of a trans-tibial patellar tendon <b>bearing</b> (PTB) <b>socket</b> may be {{influenced}} by consistency in casting, rectification or alignment. For this study two distinctive different data-capturing concepts were tested in relation to prosthetist performance. The hands-on PTB and hands-off ICECAST compact® concept were studied and compared for inter- and intraprosthetist consistency using a specially designed manikin stump model. A purpose designed digitiser was used to scan a selected surface area of the produced models, 5 for each concept, 10 in total. The extent of casting consistency at each of 936 locations per plaster model was calculated and the level of consistency was quantified. This study has shown that by using the manikin model there is a clear indication that the investigated hands-off concept produces more consistent results than the hands-on concept...|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of above-knee socket has been {{designed}} to provide total surface support and to dispense with ischial bearing as the primary weight <b>bearing</b> area. The <b>socket</b> is based upon the hypothesis that if the soft tissues of an above-knee stump are adequately supported in a suitably shaped container they will behave under load as an elastic solid with low stiffness. A method has been devised for taking the cast for the new type socket using an elastic sleeve as a “compliant socket”. The grip of the elastic sleeve and the use of traction weights deform the stump tissues to the required shape while the cast is setting. The results of laboratory measurements of the transinterface pressures in these sockets under axial loading conditions have correlated well with the figures forecast by calculation. The new socket is now available to patients at a number of Centres in England...|$|R
40|$|Abstract − Recent studies {{emphasize}} the importance of pivot stiffness in the analysis of tilting pad bearings (TPBs). The present paper develops a finite element model of the pad pivot and compares the predicted pivot stiffness to the results of Hertzian contact model calculations. Specifically, a finite element analysis generates tetrahedral mesh models with ~ 40, 000 nodes for a ball-socket pivot and ~ 50, 000 nodes for a rocker-back pivot. These models assume a frictionless boundary condition in the contact area. Increasing the applied loads on the pad in conjunction with increasing time steps ensures rapid convergence during the nonlinear numerical analysis. Predictions are performed using the developed finite element model for increasing the differential diameters between the pad pivot (or ball) and the <b>bearing</b> housing (or <b>socket).</b> The predictions show that the pivot contact area increases with decreasing dif-ferential diameters and increasing applied loads. Further, the maximum deformation occurring at the pivot center increases with increasing differential diameters and increasing applied loads. The pivot stiffness increases non-linearly with decreasing differential diameters and increasing applied loads. Comparisons of results of the developed finite element model to those of Hertzian contact model calculations assuming a small contact area show that the latter model underestimates the pivot stiffnesses predicted by the finite element models of the ball-socket and rocker-back pivots, particularly for small differential diameters. This result implies the need for cautionduring the desig...|$|R
40|$|Modular femoral heads {{have been}} used {{successfully}} since the mid- 1980 s in total hip arthroplasty. The use of metallic modular junctions presents {{a unique set of}} advantages and problems for use in total hip arthroplasty (THA). The separation of the head from the stem by a Morse taper has provided many benefits on the precision and balancing the reconstructed joint. Historically few complications have been reported for the modular Morse taper connection between the femoral head and trunnion of the stem in metal-on-polyethylene bearings. However, the risks or concerns are a little harder to identify and deal with. Certainly corrosion, and fatigue failure are the two most prevalent concerns but now the specifics of fretting wear and corrosive wear increasing particulate debris and the potential biological response is having an impact on the design and potential longevity of the reconstructed hip. This paper is dealing with a simpler consequence of head/stem modularity. Modular head mismatch to the <b>socket</b> <b>bearing</b> articulation. Two patients by two different surgeons at two different hospitals underwent cementless THA. Both patients were female and both presented with degenerative changes to the hip articulation. Both patients underwent hip replacement via a direct anterior approach using a standard hemispherical porous coated shell. One patient had a ceramic on ceramic bearing and the other had a ceramic head on a polyethylene liner. Both patients had a 32 mm inside diameter liner implanted and both had a 36 mm ceramic femoral head. The ceramic on ceramic mismatch was not recognized until the second office visit at eight weeks. The ceramic poly mismatch was not recognized until first office visit at six weeks. Both underwent correction surgery. These two cases demonstrate human mistakes can be made and steps need to be established to prevent future mistakes of this nature...|$|R
40|$|Aggressive engine downsizing, {{variable}} {{compression ratio}} {{and use of the}} Atkinson cycle are being combined to improve fuel economy by up to 40 percent relative to port fuel injected gasoline engines, while maintaining full engine power. Approach Engine downsizing is viewed by US and foreign automobile manufacturers {{as one of the best}} options for improving fuel economy. While this strategy has already demonstrated a degree of success, downsizing and fuel economy gains are currently limited. With new {{variable compression ratio}} technology however, the degree of engine downsizing and fuel economy improvement can be greatly increased. A small variable compression ratio (VCR) engine has the potential to return significantly higher vehicle fuel economy while also providing high power. Affordability and potential for near term commercialization are key attributes of the Envera VCR engine. VCR Technology To meet torque and power requirements, a smaller engine needs to do more work per stroke. This is typically accomplished by boosting the incoming charge with either a turbo or supercharger so that more energy is present in the cylinder per stroke to do the work. With current production engines the degree of engine boosting (which correlates to downsizing) is limited by detonation (combustion knock) at high boost levels. Additionally, the turbo or supercharger needs to be responsive and efficient while providing the needed boost. VCR technology eliminates the limitation of engine knock at high load levels by reducing compression ratio to {approx} 9 : 1 (or whatever level is appropriate) when high boost pressures are needed. By reducing the compression ratio during high load demand periods there is increased volume in the cylinder at top dead center (TDC) which allows more charge (or energy) to be present in the cylinder without increasing the peak pressure. Cylinder pressure is thus kept below the level at which the engine would begin to knock. When loads on the engine are low the compression ratio can be raised (to as much as 18 : 1) providing high engine efficiency. It is important to recognize that for a well designed VCR engine cylinder pressure does not need to be higher than found in current production turbocharged engines. As such, there is no need for a stronger crankcase, bearings and other load bearing parts within the VCR engine. The Envera VCR mechanism uses an eccentric carrier approach to adjust engine compression ratio. The crankshaft main bearings are mounted in this eccentric carrier or 'crankshaft cradle' and pivoting the eccentric carrier 30 degrees adjusts compression ratio from 9 : 1 to 18 : 1. The eccentric carrier is made up of a casting that provides rigid support for the main bearings, and removable upper bearing caps. Oil feed to the main bearings transits through the <b>bearing</b> cap fastener <b>sockets.</b> The eccentric carrier design was chosen for its low cost and rigid support of the main bearings. A control shaft and connecting links are used to pivot the eccentric carrier. The control shaft mechanism features compression ratio lock-up at minimum and maximum compression ratio settings. The control shaft method of pivoting the eccentric carrier was selected due to its lock-up capability. The control shaft can be rotated by a hydraulic actuator or an electric motor. The engine shown in Figures 3 and 4 has a hydraulic actuator that was developed under the current program. In-line 4 -cylinder engines are significantly less expensive than V engines because an entire cylinder head can be eliminated. The cost savings from eliminating cylinders and an entire cylinder head will notably offset the added cost of the VCR and supercharging. Replacing V 6 and V 8 engines with in-line VCR 4 -cylinder engines will provide high fuel economy at low cost. Numerous enabling technologies exist which have the potential to increase engine efficiency. The greatest efficiency gains are realized when the right combination of advanced and new technologies are packaged together to provide the greatest gains at the least cost. Aggressive engine downsizing with variable compression ratio and use of the extended Atkinson cycle can provide large fuel economy gains that are exceptionally cost effective. Analysis indicates that a 2. 2 L supercharged Envera VCR engine can match the torque of a larger V 8 engine at 2000 rpm. The VCR engine's high torque value at low engine speed is beneficial for maintaining the driving feel and responsiveness of the larger V 8 engine. The Envera VCR engine will attain high efficiency at {approx} 100 Nm primarily due to the combination of engine down-sizing and use of the Atkinson cycle. Qualitatively the fuel economy gain realized from down-sizing from a V 8 to an Atkinson-cycle I- 4 is about twice as large as the benefits from down-sizing from a V 8 to a Turbo V 6 when evaluated at 100 Nm 2000 rpm...|$|R
