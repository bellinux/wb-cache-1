25|$|Alongside his passionate {{antipathy}} towards Germany, Kipling was privately deeply {{critical of}} how the war was fought by the British Army, complaining as early as October 1914 that Germany should have been defeated by now, and something must <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the British Army. Kipling, who {{was shocked by the}} heavy losses that the British Expeditionary Force had taken by the autumn of 1914, blamed the entire pre-war generation of British politicians, who he argued had failed to learn the lessons of the Boer War. As a result, thousands of British soldiers were now paying with their lives for their failure in the fields of France and Belgium.|$|E

2500|$|Away they went, thunder-and-turf, out the Canal Road. Coutts took [...] Saucel {{at about}} his usual , and {{he slid the}} whole crowd in [...] "The Shebeen" [...] under the table. Paisley Canal station did the same; and so did Elderslie. Right out at the cow's tail and getting all the wag, the {{distinguished}} party had a pretty stormy trip {{all the way to}} Ayr, at which point the murder of Coutts was strongly advocated. But when they found that Coutts had actually lost a minute to Paisley, they began to think something must <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the routing, so the 5.10 was altered to run via the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Line, which was at least straight.|$|E
2500|$|The art {{historian}} Nancy Kelker of Middle Tennessee State University {{argues that a}} vague provenance, atypical stone, unusual carving of the back, nonstandard posture, recent publication of scholarly material on Olmec jades, and an urgent interest among Mexicans to find a myth for their origin in antiquity all {{suggest that it is}} a modern sculpture. [...] In response to these arguments, the archaeologist Michael Coe and the {{art historian}} Mary Miller, both of Yale University, defended the sculpture as authentic, arguing that its similarity to Monument 34 from the Olmec site San Lorenzo, {{and the fact that we}} know little about Olmec art make it probable that this is an Olmec masterpiece from antiquity. [...] At a separate time Coe stated that if Heizer felt the sculpture was a fake based on the petrographic analysis, then [...] "something must <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the petrographic analysis!". [...] Susan Milbrath also argues against the possibility of a forgery. [...] Milbrath maintains that its 1933 discovery, well before archaeologists defined Olmec culture or excavated Olmec sites, precludes falsification. [...] She suggests that the Wrestler represents [...] "a little known aspect of Olmec monumental art".|$|E

60|$|What then? Remember this, {{that death}} is an enemy, an evil thing, an enemy to man, and {{therefore}} an enemy to Christ, the King and Head and Saviour of man. Men ought not to die, and they feel it. It is no use to tell them, 'Everything that is born must die, and why not you? All other animals died. They died, just as they die now, {{hundreds of thousands of}} years before man came upon this earth; and why should man expect to have a different lot? Why should you not take your death patiently, as you take any other evil which you cannot escape?' The heart of man, as soon as he begins to be a man, and not a mere savage; as soon as he begins to think reasonably, and feel deeply; the heart of man answers: 'No, I am not a mere animal. I have something in me which ought not to die, which perhaps cannot die. I have a living soul in me, which {{ought to be able to}} keep my body alive likewise, but cannot; and therefore death is my enemy. I hate him, and I believe that I was meant to hate him. Something must <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> me, or I should not die; something must <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> all mankind, or I should not see those I love dying round me.|$|E
