50|$|In anatomy, the G cell {{is a type}} of cell in {{the stomach}} and {{duodenum}} that secretes gastrin. It works in conjunction with gastric chief cells and parietal cells. G cells are found deep within the pyloric glands of the stomach antrum, and occasionally in the pancreas and duodenum. The vagus nerve innervates the G cells. Gastrin-releasing peptide is released by the post-ganglionic fibers of the vagus nerve onto G cells during parasympathetic stimulation. The peptide hormone <b>bombesin</b> also stimulates gastrin from G cells. Gastrin-releasing peptide, as well as the presence of amino acids in the stomach, stimulates the release of gastrin from the G cells.

Three studies {{were performed to}} identify potential mechanisms involved in GRP/bombesin receptor regulation. ^ Although <b>bombesin</b> receptors are localized throughout the gastrointestinal tract, few gastrointestinal cell lines are available to study <b>bombesin</b> action. In the first study, the binding and function of <b>bombesin</b> receptors in the human HuTu- 80 duodenal cancer cell line were characterized. (125 I-Tyr 4) <b>bombesin</b> bound with high affinity to a GRP-preferring receptor. <b>Bombesin</b> treatment increased IP 3 production, but {{had no effect on}} cell proliferation. Similar processing of (125 I-Tyr 4) <b>bombesin</b> and of GRP-receptors was observed in HuTu- 80 cells and Swiss 3 T 3 fibroblasts, a cell line which mitogenically responds to <b>bombesin.</b> Therefore, the lack of a <b>bombesin</b> mitogenic effect in HuTu- 80 cells is not due to unusual processing of (125 I-Tyr 4) <b>bombesin</b> or rapid GRP-receptor down-regulation. ^ In the second study, a <b>bombesin</b> antagonist was developed to study the processing and regulatory events after antagonist binding. As previously shown, receptor bound agonist, (125 I-Tyr 4) <b>bombesin,</b> was rapidly internalized and degraded in chloroquine-sensitive compartments. Interestingly, receptor-bound antagonist, (125 I-D-Tyr 6) bombesin(6 - 13) PA was not internalized, but degraded at the cell-surface. In contrast to <b>bombesin,</b> (D-Tyr 6) bombesin(6 - 13) PA treatment did not cause receptor internalization. Together these results demonstrate that receptor regulation and receptor-mediated processing of antagonist is different from that of agonist. ^ <b>Bombesin</b> receptors undergo acute desensitization. By analogy to other G-protein-coupled receptors, a potential desensitization mechanism may involve receptor phosphorylation. In the final study, 32 P-labelled Swiss 3 T 3 fibroblasts and CHO-mBR 1 cells were treated with <b>bombesin</b> and the GRP-receptor was immunoprecipitated. In both cell lines, <b>bombesin</b> treatment markedly stimulated GRP-receptor phosphorylation. Furthermore, bombesin-stimulated GRP-receptor phosphorylation occurred within the same time period as bombesin-stimulated desensitization, demonstrating that these two processes are correlated. ^ In conclusion, these studies of GRP-receptor regulation further our understanding of <b>bombesin</b> action and provide insight into G-protein-coupled receptor regulation in general. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPr) are {{expressed}} in high numbers on human prostate cancer. The <b>bombesin</b> peptide derivative, BBN(7 - 14) NH 2, has high affinity and selectivity to GRPr. Therefore, Copper- 64 (64 Cu) radiolabeled <b>bombesin</b> conjugates could have potential in positron-emission tomography (PET) of human prostate cancer. Methods: In vitro assays of the NO 2 A <b>bombesin</b> conjugates and non-radioactive 63 Cu-NO 2 A <b>bombesin</b> conjugates were performed in human PC- 3 cells. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies of the radiolabeled 64 Cu-NO 2 A <b>bombesin</b> conjugates were performed in normal CF- 1 and PC- 3 tumor-bearing SCID mice. In vivo, multimodal, molecular images were obtained of the radiolabeled 64 Cu-NO 2 A <b>bombesin</b> conjugates in PC- 3 tumor-bearing SCID mice via microPET/CT. Results: In vitro studies indicated idea uptake of the NO 2 A <b>bombesin</b> conjugates (1. 99 - 6. 24 nM), and 63 Cu-NO 2 A <b>bombesin</b> conjugates (3. 16 - 51. 81 nM) in PC- 3 cells. In vivo results of the 64 Cu-NO 2 A <b>bombesin</b> conjugates at 1, 4, and 24 h p. i. showed affinity towards GRPr-positive tissue and effective clearance properties. Due to the favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of 64 Cu-NO 2 A <b>bombesin</b> conjugates, high-resolution multimodal, molecular imaging was performed via microPET/CT in a PC- 3 tumor-bearing SCID mouse model. High-quality target to non-target images were obtained, with the tumors clearly visible. Conclusions: The 64 Cu-NO 2 A <b>bombesin</b> conjugates showed affinity and specificity towards GRPr-positive tissues.

Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the effect of different doses of Ghrelin or <b>bombesin</b> on mean plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), Triiodothyronine (T 3) and Thyroxin (T 4) concentration and also, the effect of interaction between Ghrelin and <b>bombesin</b> on thyroid axis activity.

40|$|<b>Bombesin</b> and gastrin-releasing peptide act as {{autocrine}} mitogens {{in various}} cancers. <b>Bombesin</b> antagonist RC- 3095 inhibited growth in some cancers and slowed {{the progression of}} premalignant lesions, possibly by down-regulating epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors. Since the EGF receptor mitogen response involves tyrosine kinase stimulation, we tested the hypotheses that <b>bombesin</b> stimulates, and RC- 3095 inhibits, phosphorylation; EGF and <b>bombesin</b> promote the phosphorylation of the same substrates; and EGF and <b>bombesin</b> act synergistically on phosphorylation. Therefore, in vitro assays for phosphorylation were performed in {{the presence or absence}} of EGF, <b>bombesin,</b> RC- 3095, and combinations in samples derived from tumor, tissue surrounding tumor, cell lines, and normal and transforming tissue derived from the 9, 10 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene-induced squamous cell lesions of the hamster cheek pouch. <b>Bombesin</b> increased, and RC- 3095 decreased, phosphorylation in these samples. In the human hepatoma sample and surrounding tissue, these ligands altered the phosphorylation of the same substrates affected by EGF. EGF and <b>bombesin</b> stimulated phosphorylation synergistically in the hamster samples and the hepatoma. Bombesin-induced phosphorylation was greater in tissue surrounding the hepatoma, whereas RC- 3095 was more effective in inhibiting phosphorylation in the hepatoma itself. This cancer, therefore, could be endogenously stimulated by gastrin-releasing peptide. These observations support the hypothesis that <b>bombesin</b> stimulates growth of tissues and tumors by amplifying the phosphorylation response to EGF.

A background infusion of synthetic secretin 20. 5 pmol/kg per h was given in each experiment. In addition, gastric acid secretion was determined in the experiments with <b>bombesin</b> and caerulein infusion. Pancreatic protein responses to <b>bombesin</b> (1231 (247) mg/h) and food (1430 (220) mg/h) were similar to the responses to caerulein (1249 (201) mg/h). Lorglumide inhibited pancreatic protein output during stimulation with <b>bombesin</b> by 60 %, after the meal by 45 %, and during caerulein infusion by 68 %. Pancreatic bicarbonate output by <b>bombesin,</b> caerulein, and food was inhibited by lorglumide by 28 %, 40 %, and 38 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the interactions between <b>bombesin</b> and substance P at the feline lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Intraluminal pressures were recorded using a fixed, perfused catheter assembly. Myoelectrical activity was recorded using bipolar Ag-AgCl serosal electrodes. <b>Bombesin,</b> i. v., gave a dose-dependent increase in LES pressure and electronically counted spike activity. The threshold dose was 10 (- 7) g/kg, while the maximal dose, 10 (- 5) g/kg, increased LES pressure by 65. 5 +/- 14. 8 mmHg. The neuroantagonist, tetrodotoxin, decreased the LES response to <b>bombesin</b> by 74. 1 % +/- 7. 9 % (P less than 0. 05), but had no significant effect on the LES response to substance P. The sphincteric response to <b>bombesin</b> was not inhibited by bilateral cervical vagotomy, atropine, propranolol, or phentolamine (P less than 0. 10). <b>Bombesin</b> tachyphylaxis abolished the LES response to <b>bombesin</b> but had no effect on the response to substance P. Conversely, substance P tachyphylaxis completely abolished the LES response to <b>bombesin</b> (P less than 0. 001). The substance P antagonist [D-Pro 2, D-Trp 7, 9]substance P also significantly inhibited the LES response to <b>bombesin</b> (P less than 0. 05). Acidification of the distal esophagus with 2. 0 ml of 0. 1 N HCl increased LES pressure by 32. 5 +/- 5. 2 mmHg (P less than 0. 02). The LES response to acid was inhibited by <b>bombesin</b> tachyphylaxis (maximal pressure response, 4. 7 +/- 2. 1 mmHg, P less than 0. 01 compared with control acid response). The tachyphylaxis techniques were specific for the peptides giving no effect on the LES responses to phenylephrine, bethanechol, or pentagastrin. We drew the following conclusions: (a) <b>bombesin</b> increased feline LES pressure via nonvagal neural pathways that were insensitive to adrenergic or cholinergic antagonists; (b) <b>bombesin</b> may be involved in the enteric pathways that mediate the feline LES response to distal esophageal acidification; and (c) substance P mediates the effect of <b>bombesin</b> at the LES and is a neurotransmitter in the LES response to acidification...|$|E
