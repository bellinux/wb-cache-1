5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{depicts the}} Roman goddess of love, beauty and {{fertility}} reclining languidly on her bed, {{her back to}} the viewer—in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a <b>back</b> <b>view</b> was a common visual and literary erotic motif—and her knees tucked. She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and myrtle are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her with blond hair, Velázquez's Venus is a brunette. The female figure can be identified as Venus {{because of the presence of}} her son, Cupid.|$|E
5|$|One {{innovation}} of the Rokeby Venus, {{when compared}} to other large single nude paintings, {{lies in the fact that}} Velázquez depicts a <b>back</b> <b>view</b> of its subject who is turned away from the viewer. There were precedents for this in prints by Giulio Campagnola, Agostino Veneziano, Hans Sebald Beham and Theodor de Bry, as well as classical sculptures known to Velázquez, of which casts were made for Madrid. These were the Sleeping Ariadne now in the Pitti Palace, but then in Rome, of which Velázquez ordered a cast for the Royal collection in 1650–51, and the Borghese Hermaphroditus, a sleeping hermaphrodite (picture to the right above), now in the Louvre, of which a cast was sent to Madrid, and which also emphasises the curve from hip to waist. However, the combination of elements in Velázquez's composition was original.|$|E
500|$|The dentary of {{the lower}} jaw {{expanded}} in height towards the front (by the mandibular symphysis), where it was also flattened, {{and it had a}} downwards projection at the tip (which has been referred to as a [...] "chin"). The lower side of the dentary was concave, the outer side was convex in upper view, and a groove ran along it, which supported foramina that nourished the teeth. The inner side of the dentary had a row of interdental plates, where each tooth had a foramen. The Meckelian groove ran along the lower border. The curvature of the dentary shows that the mouth of Giganotosaurus would have been wide. It is possible that each dentary had twelve alveoli (tooth sockets). Most of the alveoli were about 3.5cm (1.3in) long from front to back. The teeth of the dentary were of similar shape and size, except for the first one, which was smaller. The teeth were compressed sideways, were oval in cross-section, and had serrations at the front and back borders, which is typical of theropods. The teeth were sigmoid-shaped when seen in front and <b>back</b> <b>view.</b> One tooth had nine to twelve serrations per millimetre (0.039in). The side teeth of Giganotosaurus had curved ridges of enamel, and the largest teeth in the premaxilla (front of the upper jaw) had pronounced wrinkles (with their highest relief near the serrations).|$|E

500|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} appear white. Individual spores are {{ellipsoid}} to tear-shaped in profile, obovoid to ellipsoid or roughly cylindric in face or <b>back</b> <b>view,</b> with dimensions of 4.8–6.4 by 2–2.8 (sometimes up to 3.5) µm. They are smooth, inamyloid, and acyanophilous (unreactive to staining with Melzer's reagent and methyl blue, respectively). The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells of the}} hymenium) are roughly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 17.5–21 by 4.8–5.6µm. The gills do not have cystidia. The gill tissue is made of hyphae that are interwoven to roughly parallel, and inamyloid. The hyphae are 2.8–8.4µm in diameter and smooth. The cap tissue is made of interwoven hyphae beneath {{the center of the}} cap, but radially oriented over the gills; it too is inamyloid. These hyphae are 3.5–8.4µm in diameter, smooth, but have irregularly thickened walls. [...] The cap cuticle is an ixocutis—a gelatinized layer of hyphae lying parallel to the cap surface. The hyphae comprising this layer are 2.8–6.4µm in diameter, smooth, and thin-walled. They are covered with scattered, short pouch-like outgrowths. The cuticle of the stem is a layer of parallel, vertically oriented hyphae; the hyphae measure 3.5–4.2µm, and are smooth, slightly thick-walled, and pale yellowish-brown in alkaline solution. They give rise to a covering of tangled and branched caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that have multiple septa. The caulocystidia are 2.8–4.8µm in diameter, smooth, thin walled, and shaped like contorted cylinders. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues.|$|E
500|$|The {{spore print}} is white. Individual spores are smooth, [...] to tear-shaped in profile, [...] to {{ellipsoid}} or cylindric in face or <b>back</b> <b>view,</b> with dimensions of 4.2–6.2 by 2.8–3.5µm. They are inamyloid and [...] (non-reactive to staining with Melzer's reagent and Methyl blue, respectively). The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are club-shaped to cylindric and 15.4–21 by 3.5–5µm. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are scattered to infrequent, inconspicuous, and 17.5–31.5µm long. Their shape ranges from a contorted cylinder to roughly club-shaped to irregularly diverticulate (with short offshoots approximately {{at right angles to}} the main stem). There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue is made of interwoven hyphae that are non-reactive to Melzer's reagent. These hyphae are smooth and thin-walled, measuring 2.8–6.4µm in diameter. The cap tissue is made of hyphae that is interwoven below the center of the cap, radially oriented over the gills, and inamyloid. These hyphae are smooth, thin-walled, and 2.8–7µm in diameter. The cap cuticle is a thin layer of smooth thin-walled hyphae that are more or less radially oriented, bent-over, cylindric and somewhat gelatinous, measuring 2–5µm in diameter; they are occasionally diverticulate. The cuticle of the stem is made of a layer of parallel, vertically oriented smooth, thin-walled hyphae that are 2–4.2µm in diameter, pale yellowish brown in alkali mounting solution. The stem has moderately thin-walled and smooth cystidia that are resemble [...] or contorted cylinders. They are hyaline in alkali, and 3.5–7µm in diameter. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues.|$|E

2500|$|Terry {{is younger}} than his sisters Audrey (Sheila Fearn) and Linda (who is never seen). Their parents are Edith and Cyril Collier. Terry's father {{is not seen}} in either series of the 1970s show; neither is Bob's father, Leslie, who had died 12 years {{previously}} (as established in the Sixties episode [...] "Friends and Neighbours"), so wasn't around when Bob, an only child, was growing up. Terry's dad is neither dead nor absent: he is continually {{referred to in the}} Seventies series, and also in the feature film, but is never actually seen (although, in the opening flash-back in the film, a <b>back</b> <b>view</b> of him is briefly visible, which is clearly James Bolam; and Bolam also provides the voice-over dialogue in that scene). Bob's mother, Alice, occasionally appears; Terry's mother (...) is frequently seen in the 1973 series.|$|E
2500|$|Circa 1940 {{images of}} the house show that Modernist {{elements}} were incorporated into Harrison's design. A photograph of the façade reveals a stone garage next to a simple white door, with a high serpentine wall snaking up the ramp path to the front door; the house's two-story façade is made of stone with porthole windows and a large rectangular stone structure {{to the right of}} the front door. It presents a very private and industrial front, with stone and glass, and a ramp path to the door, like a conveyor belt in a factory. The <b>back</b> <b>view</b> exemplifies use of the building's twelve exterior doors, many of them stone and glass, and opens up to a wider view of the back, which is more spacious with trees and in harmony with nature because of the local fieldstone that echoes the surrounding rocky landscape. There is little ornamental decoration, it is simply constructed with industrial materials in keeping with Breuer and Gropius's idea of [...] "unit construction" [...] or the bringing together of [...] "standard units to create a technologically simple but functionally complex whole," [...] and the use of new materials to create art design that reflected the age of industry. With Harrison's use of steel and glass, as well as the industrial conveyor-belt like ramp to the house's front door, Harrison used new materials to reflect the age of industry, and its simple forms of stone sections form a composite, complex stone entirety. Gropius and Breuer designed Gropius's own house in ppLincoln, Massachusetts]], which used both fieldstone and wood painted white, re-establishing [...] "New England traditionalism in modern terms." [...] With his use of fieldstone in the Street residence, Harrison was even incorporating some of the same materials as the Modernist architects of his time, Gropius and Breuer.|$|E
