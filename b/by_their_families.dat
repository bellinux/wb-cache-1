5|$|Although Douglas {{had been}} {{the cause of his}} misfortunes, he and Wilde were reunited in August 1897 at Rouen. This meeting was disapproved of by the friends and {{families}} of both men. Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet Wilde or allow him to see their sons, though she sent him money – a meagre three pounds a week. During the latter part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together near Naples for a few months until they were separated <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> under the threat of cutting off all funds.|$|E

5|$|Another {{instance}} of population control is {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per {{year because of the}} preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help to find out the sex of the fetus. In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge gender gap in China.|$|E
5|$|Having {{captured}} Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the crusading vow had hence been fulfilled.

When {{the success of the}} crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> and threatened with excommunication by the Pope. Many crusaders who had remained with the crusade all the way to Jerusalem also went home; according to Fulcher of Chartres, {{there were only a few}} hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100. Godfrey himself only ruled for one year, dying in July 1100. He was succeeded by his brother, Baldwin of Edessa, the first person to take the title King of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, gay bathhousesnow {{primarily}} gay-owned and operatedbecame fully licensed gay establishments which soon became major gay institutions.

Gay bathhouses frequently threw parties for Pride Day and were usually open, and busy, on public holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, when some gay men, {{particularly those who}} had been rejected <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> due to their sexual orientation, had nowhere else to go.

5|$|Minneapolis Public Schools enroll 36,370 {{students}} in public {{primary and secondary}} schools. The district administers about 100 public schools including 45 elementary schools, seven middle schools, seven high schools, eight special education schools, eight alternative schools, 19 contract alternative schools, and five charter schools. With authority granted by the state legislature, the school board makes policy, selects the superintendent, and oversees the district's budget, curriculum, personnel, and facilities. Students speak 90 different languages at home and most school communications are printed in English, Hmong, Spanish, and Somali. About 44% of {{students in}} the Minneapolis Public School system graduate, which ranks the 6th worst out of the nation's 50 largest cities. Some students attend public schools in other school districts chosen <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> under Minnesota's open enrollment statute. Besides public schools, the city is home to more than 20 private schools and academies and about 20 additional charter schools.|$|E

No.481 (Maintenance) Squadron provided technical service for the Mustangs. Occupation duties proved uneventful, the main operational task being surveillance patrols, but units maintained an intensive training regime and undertook combined exercises with other Allied forces.

5|$|The Moreno {{family was}} poor, but {{could afford a}} house and some slaves. Ana María Valle y Ramos, Mariano's mother, {{was one of the}} few literate women in Buenos Aires. Mariano Moreno was the firstborn of {{fourteen}} children. Mariano moved to Chuquisaca with his brother Manuel Moreno and their friend Tomás Guido once the family raised the money. The long and difficult journey gave Mariano a rheumatism attack; he had to stay in bed for fifteen days on arrival. He had further attacks years later. Moreno met María Guadalupe Cuenca in this city, after seeing a miniature portrait of her at a silversmith's house. Both Moreno and María were expected <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> to follow religious studies, and Moreno's father did not authorize a change. Moreno studied laws all the same, and married María in secret to avoid family resistance. They had a single son, named Mariano like the father.|$|E

5|$|The Saint Paul Public Schools {{district}} is the state's second largest school district and serves approximately 42,000 students.

The district runs 82 different schools, including 52 elementary schools, twelve middle schools, seven high schools, ten alternative schools, and one special education school, employing over 6,500 teachers and staff. The school district also oversees community education programs for pre-K and adult learners, including Early Childhood Family Education, GED Diploma, language programs, and various learning opportunities for community members of all ages. In 2006, Saint Paul Public Schools celebrated its 150th anniversary.

5|$|In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu {{website and}} his colleagues {{came up with a}} novel way of {{covering}} the Taliban's growing influence in Swat. They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala. At the time, Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, and women from going shopping. Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares. At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, four years younger than the original volunteer, and in seventh grade at the time. Editors at the BBC unanimously agreed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war, one pressing problem was the very high number of unwanted pregnancies of rape victims. Estimates of the number of pregnancies resulting in births range from 25,000 to the Bangladeshi government's figure of 70,000, while one publication by the Centre for Reproductive Law and Policy gave a total of 250,000. A government-mandated victim relief programme was set up with the support of the World Health Organization and International Planned Parenthood Federation, among whose goals it was to organise abortion facilities to help rape victims terminate unwanted pregnancies. A doctor at a rehabilitation centre in Dhaka reported 170,000 abortions of pregnancies caused by the rapes, and the births of 30,000 war babies during the first three months of 1972. Dr. Geoffrey Davis, an Australian doctor and abortion specialist who worked for the programme, estimated that there had been about 5,000 cases of self-induced abortions. He also said that during his work he heard of numerous infanticides and suicides by victims. His estimate of the total number of rape victims was 400,000, twice as high as the official estimate of 200,000 cited by the Bangladeshi government. Most of the victims also contracted sexual infections. Many suffered from feelings of intense shame and humiliation, and a number were ostracised <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> and communities or committed suicide.|$|E

5000|$|Addressing someone {{by his or}} {{her family}} name is rare though not unheard of. In the past, married women in the north were called <b>by</b> <b>their</b> (maiden) <b>family</b> name, with Thị (氏) as a suffix. In recent years, doctors are more likely than any other social group to be {{addressed}} <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> name, though this form of reference is more common in the north than in the south. Some extremely well-known people are sometimes referred to <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> names, such as Hồ Chí Minh (Bác Hồ - [...] "Uncle Hồ") (however, his real surname is Nguyễn), Trịnh Công Sơn (nhạc Trịnh - [...] "Trịnh music"), and Hồ Xuân Hương (nữ sĩ họ Hồ - [...] "the poetess with the family name Hồ").
