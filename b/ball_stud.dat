40|$|A <b>ball</b> <b>stud</b> is {{used for}} joining the {{mechanical}} elements of a ball joint in the steering or suspension system of automobiles. Process sequence design for the manufacturing of a <b>ball</b> <b>stud,</b> highly dependent on experience-based trial and error, limits the productivity and competitiveness of the product in meeting {{the demands of the}} current market. In this study, an expert system for the process sequence design of a <b>ball</b> <b>stud</b> was developed based on the Windows environment on an IBM personal computer (PC) as part of building a computer integrated design system. The developed system was composed of the main design expert system, a database system, and a computer aided design (CAD) system. The design rules were extracted from the drawings from interviews with production and design experts, and from the literature. Initial standard process sequence design was determined by looking into the characteristics and constraints of each process in forming a product. Then this design sequence was modified by applying redesigning rules to accommodate the machine capacities, such as limiting sequencing number and:or the limiting load of the forming machine selected. The input and output modules for a graphical display were implemented in the developed system. The database system was separately formulated from the main design expert system to enable data sharing among the work places and to assist the engineers with the <b>ball</b> <b>stud</b> process design by checking the feasibility of re-using existing dies and drawings. The re-designed process data were saved in. dxf files for transferring the data to a commercial CAD system such as AutoCAD, from which the drawing can be obtained. The developed system was found to be useful in generating the process sequence of a ball stu...|$|E

50|$|Depending on {{the design}} used, the valves are {{actuated}} directly by a rocker arm, finger, or bucket tappet. Overhead camshaft engines use fingers or bucket tappets, upon which the cam lobes contact, while pushrod engines use rocker arms. Rocker arms are actuated by a pushrod, and pivot on a shaft or individual <b>ball</b> <b>studs</b> in order to actuate the valves.|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-1800s}} {{techniques}} were {{developed for the}} mass production of iron nails. Following this technological improvement, boxwood <b>balls</b> <b>studded</b> with nails (boules cloutées) were introduced {{in an effort to}} improve the durability of the balls. This eventually lead to the development of balls that were completely covered in nails, creating a ball that appeared almost to be made of metal.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the flip}} chip's {{introduction}} {{a number of}} alternatives to the solder bumps have been introduced, including gold <b>balls</b> or molded <b>studs,</b> electrically conductive polymer and the [...] "plated bump" [...] process that removes an insulating plating by chemical means. Flip chips have recently gained popularity among manufacturers of cell phones, pagers and other small electronics where the size savings are valuable.|$|R
40|$|The {{flip chip}} is {{recognized}} as the most reliable chip interconnect method and renders an extremely high production yield at very low cost. Furthermore, flip chip gives extraordinary electrical performance, which is vital at GHz frequencies. The flip-chip interconnect is based on three fundamental elements, bumps on a die, chip carrier and the method of joining a die to a carrier. These elements are interdependent, thus important to consider each in order to select the optimal flip-chip system for a specific application. The tentative use of an encapsulant is another consideration. Most obviously, the gold pad and conductor metallurgy of GaAs chips bring the need for alternate bumping methods. Two different joining schemes tentatively suitable for GaAs chip pad metallurgies were tested based on thermocompression joining. Bumps were applied to the chip carrier, a thin film substrate and were either plated gold cylinders or gold <b>ball</b> bond <b>studs.</b> Cross-sections, shear tests, and X-ray imaging {{were used to determine}} the joint quality...|$|R

[...] "Chris, you're a good shit," [...] Bailey recalled saying, [...] "but you've got the <b>balls</b> of a <b>stud</b> field mouse." [...] Indignant, as Bailey expected, Darden {{asked him what he}} meant. [...] "You're not going to have our client try on these gloves, are you?" [...] he asked in response. [...] "They probably won't fit, and you may not wish to find out. But if, as I suspect, you lack the balls to find out, we might find out for you." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{has been}} a part of the Punjab U16, U19 and U22 sides. He also participated in the Dhruve Pandove Trophy. He was made the captain of the Punjab U19 team. He led his team in winning the Vinoo Mankad Trophy. Manan single-handedly led the Chandigarh {{challenge}} in the U22 tournament and hit knocks of 108, 129 and 179, He was drafted in the Punjab Ranji camp in 2008.He was selecetd for the U-19 NCA camp which was held in 2011 in Bangalore. India’s 30 best U19 players were a part of this camp, Manan being one of them. He was also included in the India U19 team that participated in the Quadrangular Series which was held in Vishakhapatnam. The other 3 teams were the U19 teams from Sri Lanka, West Indies and Australia. Manan scored 79 off 35 <b>balls</b> was <b>studded</b> with 15 fours and two sixes against Australia U19.

40|$|AbstractArmoured {{mud balls}} were {{observed}} after rainfall {{and a short}} flood in the otherwise dry Xiaohe (small river) valley of Guanling County, Guizhou Province, South China, approximately 30 km southwest of Guanling City. Armoured mud balls are most common in semiarid climates, but rather unusual in a humid climate as in Guizhou. A number of well-rounded mud balls, 2 – 20 cm in diameter, were found lying on the gravel of the Xiaohe gully floor. The mud balls consist of sticky, light brown and slightly mottled clay without carbonate content. The surfaces of the mud <b>balls</b> were <b>studded</b> with rims of sand- or gravel-size limestone clasts, collected during bedload transport, as is typical for armoured mud balls. The mud balls originated from alluvial mudstone deposits of the valley floor and cliff that are most likely derived from the weathering and karstification of bedrock limestones. Such mudstones with high clay content seem to be especially well suited for forming armoured mud balls. As flood events are rather common in the area, the formation of armoured mud balls should be very frequent in the Xiaohe valley and similar valleys nearby, giving the possibility for further and more detailed studies. To {{the best of our}} knowledge this is the first description of armoured mud balls in China...|$|R
5000|$|The 1955-up Pontiac V8 was an {{overhead}} valve engine with wedge combustion chambers. It used cast iron cylinder heads and a cast-iron block. An innovative design feature was mounting the rocker arms on <b>ball</b> pivots on <b>studs</b> set into the cylinder-head, rather than using a separate rocker shaft; this allowed more consistent valve action with less weight than a conventional shaft. It was also cheaper to build than a rocker shaft; this Pontiac-patented technology was immediately handed to the Chevrolet division for their first postwar V-8, which appeared the same year. This handing over Pontiac's valve train invention ( [...] Engineer Clayton leach [...] ) violated GM's rule for a division having a one model year exclusivity, but alas Ed Cole at Chevrolet got his way. All (except the 303 Ram Air V engine and 265 and 301) used 6.625 in connecting rods.|$|R
500|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, {{by virtue of their}} Premier League status. Their opening match was a score draw against Sunderland, which highlighted the team's shortcomings in attack, as Wright was out of the side. In the replay staged at Roker Park, Bergkamp scored the opener early in the second half, in what he described as [...] "...not only a beautiful goal, it was an important goal". The player received the ball from Merson and with the Sunderland defence closing in, twice dragged the <b>ball</b> with his <b>studs,</b> before curling it beyond goalkeeper Lionel Pérez' reach. Hughes increased the team's lead on the hour mark, by heading the ball in at the far post; it was his first goal at senior level. Arsenal exited the cup in the fourth round, with defeat to fellow Premier League side Leeds United. Striker Rod Wallace scored the only goal of the match.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} match high power density and large counts of I/Os {{with the need}} for smaller-sized {{automotive}} electronic devices and low cost, new solutions have to be developed without any concessions to reliability. The authors describe the so-called i 2 Board concept, developed by Schweizer Electronic AG and used in the VISA project, funded by the German Government. VISA is an abbreviation and means "fully integrated power electronic systems for automotive electronics" [1]. A micro processor with 231 very dense interconnects and high power dissipation is embedded into a demo transmission control unit (TCU) from Continental. First the die is mounted on an organic interposer which also acts as fan-out for the I/Os. Then the component is embedded into the final board and the interconnection with the complete circuit is formed by a combination of via laser drilling and metallisation steps. No special steps except those of standard PCB processing are necessary. However, very precise manufacturing has to be assured. This way, high density packaging and very short signal paths are enabled. Three interconnecting technologies (Cu pillars, solder <b>balls,</b> and Au <b>stud</b> bumps) are discussed with respect to their applicability for high precision chip mounting. Further technological details like the choice of suitable materials are outlined...|$|R
