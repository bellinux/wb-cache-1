The following year, the church's leadership opened Westboro Baptist Church {{on the other side of}} town, and Phelps became its pastor.

[...] (The <b>Baptist</b> <b>World</b> <b>Alliance</b> and the Southern Baptist Convention have both denounced Phelps and his teachings over the years, as have many Primitive Baptist congregations.) [...] His vitriolic preaching alienated church leaders and most of the original congregation, leaving him with a small following consisting almost entirely of his own relatives and close friends. [...] Phelps was forced to support himself selling vacuum cleaners, baby strollers, and insurance; later, some of his 13 children were reportedly compelled to sell candy door-to-door for several hours each day.
