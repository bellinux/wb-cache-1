5|$|Throughout the denomination's existence, {{theological}} battles were {{fought over}} how the Confession of Faith would <b>be</b> <b>interpreted.</b> During the 19th century, Old School Presbyterians insisted that the Confession <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> according to strict Calvinism, while the New School Presbyterians favored a looser interpretation. From 1910 to 1927, the Confession of Faith was officially interpreted with reference to five fundamental beliefs: biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth, substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection, and the miracles of Christ.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} deal with {{implication}} of the traditional understanding of the Quranic verse , some philosophers argued that the verse should <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> metaphorically (e.g. the verse could have referred to a partial lunar eclipse in which then earth obscured part of the moon).|$|E
5|$|Non-Ediacarans : Some Ediacaran organisms {{have more}} complex details preserved, which has {{allowed them to}} <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as {{possible}} early forms of living phyla excluding them from some definitions of the Ediacaran biota.|$|E
5000|$|Some plants do {{not produce}} sporophylls. Sporangia are {{produced}} directly on stems. Psilotum has <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as producing sporangia (fused in a synangium) on the terminus of a stem. Equisetum always produce strobili, but the structures bearing sporangia (sporangiophores) have <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as modified stems. The sporangia, despite being recurved <b>are</b> <b>interpreted</b> as terminal.|$|R

Some diapiric mushroom-shaped structures {{have been}} identified, which <b>are</b> <b>interpreted</b> as possible mud volcanoes. Layer and vein shungite varieties, and shungite filling vesicles and forming the matrix to breccias, <b>are</b> <b>interpreted</b> as migrated petroleum, {{now in the}} form of metamorphosed bitumen.|$|R
50|$|The archaic kouroi {{have usually}} <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as depictions of Apollo. On account of its beard, the Kouros of Apollonas has instead <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as the Greek god Dionysus.|$|R
5|$|A production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) or {{production possibility}} curve (PPC) is a graphical representation of possible combinations of two goods (such as butter and guns) {{that can be}} produced with constant technology and resources per unit of time, such that more of one good could be produced only by diverting resources from the other good, resulting in less production of it; i. e. production tradeoffs, usually for an economy, but which can also <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as applying for an individual, household, etc.|$|E
5|$|Angle brackets, , {{indicate}} {{that there is a}} sequence of runes that cannot <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> with certainty. Other special signs are þ and ð, where the first one is the thorn letter which represents a voiceless dental fricative as th in English thing. The second letter is eth which stands for a voiced dental fricative as th in English them. The ʀ sign represents the yr rune, and ô {{is the same as the}} Icelandic O caudata ǫ.|$|E
5|$|Article8 {{recognises}} {{the right}} of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the right to strike. It allows these rights to be restricted {{for members of the}} armed forces, police, or government administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> {{in a manner consistent with}} their constitutions (e.g.,China, Mexico), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as firefighters (e.g.,Japan).|$|E
50|$|In {{syntactic}} ambiguity, {{the same}} sequence of words <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> as having different syntactic structures. In contrast, in semantic ambiguity the structure remains the same, but the individual words <b>are</b> <b>interpreted</b> differently.|$|R

5|$|Because of {{the change}} in {{designated}} values relative to the WHERE clause, from a logic perspective the law of excluded middle is a tautology for CHECK constraints, meaning CHECK (p OR NOT p) always succeeds. Furthermore, assuming Nulls are to <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as existing but unknown values, some pathological CHECKs like the one above allow insertion of Nulls that could never be replaced by any non-null value.|$|E
5|$|Born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now Austria), Cartier {{initially}} {{studied to}} become an architect, before changing career paths and enrolling to study drama at the Vienna Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. There he was taught by Max Reinhardt, who proved {{a major influence on}} Cartier. Reinhardt thought of a script as being similar to a musical score, which should <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> by a director {{in the same way as}} a musician interpreting a piece of music—an approach with which Cartier agreed.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional amendments, {{such as the}} 1868 Fourteenth Amendment, {{according}} to Scalia, were to <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> based on their meaning {{at the time of}} ratification. Scalia was often asked how that approach justified the result in the 1954 case of Brown v. Board of Education, which held that segregated schools were unconstitutional and which relied on the Fourteenth Amendment for the result.|$|E

5|$|Foreign comics, {{especially}} Japanese, {{became quite}} successful in Canada, and stood out for gaining {{large numbers of}} female fans, who had traditionally stayed away from comic books. They also had a significant influence on artists such as Bryan Lee O'Malley and his Scott Pilgrim series. Due to differing social norms, the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran afoul of Canadian customs officials. Incidental nudity could <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> by them as child pornography and result in jail terms.|$|E

Thalmann published the USN E-L algorithm and tables for constant PO2 Nitrox closed circuit rebreather applications, and extended use of the E-L model for constant PO2 Heliox CCR in 1985. The E-L model may <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a bubble model.|$|E
5|$|In a study, eight addax antelopes {{on a diet}} {{of grass}} hay (Chloris gayana) were studied to {{determine}} the retention time of food from the digestive tract. It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy rumen.|$|E
50|$|The {{semantics}} of CTL* {{are defined}} {{with respect to}} some Kripke structure. As the names imply, state formulae <b>are</b> <b>interpreted</b> {{with respect to the}} states of this structure, while path formulae <b>are</b> <b>interpreted</b> over paths on it.|$|R
30|$|Following Schroeder and Murphy (1999) a “crawl” <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> as “tracks {{and other}} sign {{left on a}} beach by a sea turtle”; a “false crawl” <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> as “a crawl {{resulting}} from an abandoned nesting attempt (a non-nesting emergence)”.|$|R
25|$|The {{account of}} the {{friendship}} between David and Jonathan in the Books of Samuel has <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> by traditional and mainstream Christians as a relationship only of affectionate regard, but has <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> by some authors as of a sexual nature.|$|R
5|$|In {{his book}} A New Kind of Science, Stephen Wolfram {{points out that}} rule 184, when run on {{patterns}} with density 50%, can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as parsing the context free language describing strings formed from nested parentheses. This interpretation {{is closely related to}} the ballistic annihilation view of rule 184: in Wolfram's interpretation, an open parenthesis corresponds to a left-moving particle while a close parenthesis corresponds to a right-moving particle.|$|E
5|$|I’d {{like them}} to walk away {{thinking}} it’s a film that can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> {{in more than one}} way. I’m happy when I hear from people who’ve seen the short that it makes them think about the kind of strangeness where we find inspiration for art and where we find love, and the kind of miraculousness of just being alive and having a life. I’m pleased when people get that out of it.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11 and its planets were {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as planets whose orbits move {{in front of}} their stars from the perspective of Earth. Kepler-11 is the first discovered exoplanetary system with more than three transiting planets.|$|E
50|$|In DXT2, {{the color}} data <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> as being premultiplied by alpha, in DXT3 it <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> as not having been premultiplied by alpha.

30|$|All commits whose message {{matched the}} regular {{expression}} “back.{ 0, 5 }out”, i.e., the words “back” and “out”separated {{by up to}} five characters, <b>were</b> <b>interpreted</b> as backout commits. The purpose of the five characters separation is to match common variations, such as “backed out” and “backing out”. In a backout commit, all decimal numbers with 5 to 6 digits <b>were</b> <b>interpreted</b> as issue report identifiers, and all hexadecimal numbers with 7 to 12 digits <b>were</b> <b>interpreted</b> as commit hashes.|$|R
50|$|If L, M and N {{are three}} structures, L <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> in M,and M <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> in N, then one can {{naturally}} construct a composite interpretation of L in N.If two structures M and N <b>are</b> <b>interpreted</b> in each other, then {{by combining the}} interpretations in two possible ways, one obtains an interpretation {{of each of the}} two structures in itself.This observation permits one to define an equivalence relation among structures, reminiscent of the homotopy equivalence among topological spaces.|$|R
