25|$|Tembo and Msonthi, {{the only}} two cabinet ministers left, opened the debate by proposing the motion of confidence, but Banda's lengthy speech {{dominated}} it. In this, he claimed that the ministers had conspired against him, because he had preventing them abusing their positions and because they were being controlled by China's ambassador in Dar es Salaam. In response, only Chiume set out any detailed criticism of Banda, the others concentrated on stating their continued loyalty to him, despite being denounced as traitors. Chipembere returned from Canada on 8 September. Banda had written to him, asking him {{to remain in the}} cabinet, but this was before the debate, when Banda was uncertain of what support he had. Chipembere wished to effect a reconciliation between Banda and the ministers, and approached the Governor-General, asking him to request Banda to postpone the debate. However, as {{the first day of the}} debate had gone in Banda's favour, he decided against reconciliation and refused a postponement. Chipembere therefore resigned on the morning of 9 September and attended parliament as a <b>back-bencher,</b> sitting with the other ex-ministers. Chipembere's speech deplored the breakdown of party unity and that the ex-ministers had been reviled as traitors. He expressed his general support for their grievances, and although he expressed loyalty to Banda, he pointedly argued that cabinet responsibility should be collective and that there should be consultation on important issues.|$|E
500|$|In the past, McEwen's {{ambition}} {{has taken}} the form of interest in higher office. Twice he made feints about seeking statewide office. But he didn't want to risk his congressional seat. Now he's {{found a way to}} nurse a healthy level of ambition without taking that risk. He has, of course, a pronounced tendency to be wrong about the issues... Most typically, he appears as an ideological combatant. He seems to be selling himself to the nation's conservatives as an attractive spokesman. He's got enough talent to do it. In the days when McEwen was content to be a <b>back-bencher,</b> he was criticized on this page for his irrelevance on the important issues. Now, however, {{it is clear that the}} nation as a whole was better off when he was keeping his views to himself.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 January 1995, {{internal}} Liberal Party polling {{showed that}} with Downer as leader, the Coalition had a slim chance of holding its marginal {{seats in the}} next election, let alone of winning government. On 11 January, Downer launched a major policy statement with ten policy commitments and criticised Liberals he saw as undermining his leadership. Downer negotiated in mid-January with now <b>back-bencher</b> Hewson, but this resulted in Hewson publicly declaring he wanted the shadow Treasury portfolio, which was held by Downer's deputy, Peter Costello. On 26 January 1995 he resigned as Liberal Leader and John Howard was elected unopposed to replace him. Downer pledged his support to Howard {{and said he would}} [...] "kneecap" [...] anyone who undermined Howard's second attempt at winning the prime ministership.|$|E
