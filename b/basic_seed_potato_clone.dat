40|$|Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira, Unit of Seed Testing and Organic Production Control is {{responsible}} of the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> {{inspection and testing}} in Finland. The <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production area was 1290 hectares year 2006. The <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production is concentrated in the Nothern parts of Finland where the High Grade Region (Tyrnävä and Liminka in the Oulu region) {{for the production of}} <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> is located. Four generations of prebasic seed (class SS, S, SEE and SE), three generations of <b>basic</b> <b>seed</b> (class EC 1, EC 2 and EC 3) and one generation of certified seed (class A or B) are produced in Finland. The <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> inspection schema of Finland includes several steps: the field inspection, the laboratory tests of potato cyst nematodes, bacterial ring rot, brown rot and potato virus and finally the visual tuber inspection. The field inspection, sampling and visual tuber inspection are done by the authorized inspectors. For prebasic and <b>basic</b> <b>seed</b> the inspectors make two official field inspections. For certified seed only one field inspection is needed. Official requirements are set for varietal purity, rogues, potato virus, black leg (Erwinia spp.) and Rhizoctonia. During the field inspection the background information as previous crop is checked. The soil sample for testing potato cyst nematodes is taken per each hectare. The potato cyst nematodes (Globodera sp.) are quarantine organisms and the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production is not possible on the field infected by the nematodes. In the autumn the tubers for winter tests in the laboratory are sampled. For bacterial ring rot a sample is 200 tubers/ha and for virus tests 200 tubers/field. Brown rot is tested as a survey of <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production. The testing method for bacterial ring rot (Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus) and brown rot (Ralstonia solanacearum) is the immunofluorescense (IF) method based on the specific antibodies. These quarantine organisms are not accepted in the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> production. The potato virus Y-, A-, X-, S-, M- and Potato Leaf Roll are tested once during <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> certification process usually as the prebasic seed. For the other <b>seed</b> classes the <b>potato</b> virus Y and potato virus A are tested. For certified <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> class A there is a list of varieties which are tested. The seed class B is not routinely tested. The testing method is ELISAtest. The <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> companies need certificate labels before sorting and packing potatoes. A visual tuber inspection is done by the local inspectors. A sample of 400 tubers/ 50 tn is cut by knife and tubers are inspected one by one. There are requirements for soil, dry and wet rot, external blemishes, common scab, black scurf, skin spot and deep-pitted scab. The quarantine organisms or visual symtops of moptop virus or tobacco rattle virus are not accepted. If all steps of inspection and testing are according to legislation, the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> lot is officially certified and can be marketed as <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> to the farmers. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>potato</b> <b>clone</b> G 8107 (1) {{has been}} {{identified}} as resistant to both PLRV infection and multiplication. In this study, attempts were made to reveal the mechanism(s) involved in the resistance of this clone to PLRV infection. Considering the existence of a rigid cell wall as a passive resistance barrier or mature-plant resistance as barrier to virus infection, experiments were conducted in which softer tissues of this <b>potato</b> <b>clone</b> (sprouts and in vitro propagated plantlets) were aphid inoculated with PLRV. The results indicated that aphid inoculation of both tissue types of this <b>potato</b> <b>clone</b> with PLRV did not lead in breakdown of its resistance to virus infection. Therefore, it was concluded that the resistance of this clone to PLRV infection via aphid inoculation is not associated with the existence of a rigid cell wall or mature-plant resistance. It is suggested that the observed resistance might be due to the PLRV replication failure in the tissues of this <b>potato</b> <b>clone,</b> or inability of the virus to transport from the initially infected cells and or, somehow, degradation of the virus particles after replication. However, it seems that this very strong resistant <b>potato</b> <b>clone</b> is an excellent choice to be exploited in PLRV resistance breeding programs.

40|$|Keywords: Potato, {{positive}} selection, viruses, <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> systems, East Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a crop with a {{high potential}} to contribute to poverty reduction in Eastern Africa through income increase and improved food security. It is largely grown by smallholders, has a high production per hectare, stable prices and a steadily growing demand. Average yields in Eastern Africa of 10. 5 t/ha are much below the world average and yields observed {{in the fields of}} better performing smallholders. There is both a need and a potential for increased potato productivity. A diagnosis of the potato systems of Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia identified integrated management of bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum) and late blight (Phytophthora infestans), soil fertility management, and improving <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> quality as technology-based opportunities for innovation. Improvement of potato supply chains and the knowledge exchange in the sector were identified as systemic opportunities for improvement. Analysis of the <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> system confirms that both virus diseases and bacterial wilt are likely contributors to the low yields. In only 3 % of <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> tubers sold in rural markets was free of PVY, PLRV, PVX and PVA. Ralstonia solanacearum was found in 74 % of potato farms sampled in Kenya. Less than 5 % of the <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> used are sourced from specialized multipliers (specialized chain). Farmers rely on <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> from neighbours and farm-saved <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> (local chain). This often makes economic sense in the absence of affordable high quality <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> and limited market security. <b>Seed</b> <b>potato</b> system interventions need to tackle the local and specialized chain simultaneously. Private investment in specialized multiplication could stimulate the production of affordable high-quality <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes.</b> For local chain improvement training on seed quality maintenance and on bacterial wilt and virus management is needed. Research into the mitigation of yield-reducing effects of indiscriminate <b>seed</b> <b>potato</b> recycling, such as research on virus resistance and positive selection deserves attention. Positive selection, the selection of healthy looking mother plants for the production of <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes,</b> can contribute to improving quality management in the local chain. In farmer managed trials in Kenya it gave an average yield increase of 34 % which corresponded to a 284 Euro profit increase per ha. It requires no cash and only 4 man-days 12 per hectare and is an important alternative and complementary technology to regular seed replacement. In 18 replicated trials it was shown that positive selection lowered the incidence of PLRV, PVY and PVX with 35 %, 35 % and 39 %, respectively, and increased yields irrespective of the agro-ecology, crop management, soil fertility, variety, and quality of the starting material with an average 30 %, compared to current farmer practice. Regression analysis showed that this reduction in virus incidence contributed to the higher yields, but did not fully account for the effect. Probably other, not tested, virus diseases and other seed borne diseases also played a role. It can be concluded that positive selection can benefit all smallholder potato producers who select <b>seed</b> <b>potatoes</b> from their own fields, and should thus be incorporated routinely in agricultural extension efforts. In retrospect the research trajectory can be considered a successful contribution of agricultural research to innovation. It shows that it is worthwhile to search for opportunities for incremental innovation that do not require institutional change and that these opportunities can be of a surprising simple nature, and based on old technology. Essential for researchers to contribute to innovation is room to manoeuvre and opportunity to immerse in practical collaborative partnerships with practitioners. Most importantly, innovation needs to be made a central objective, rather than research results, and the mandate of research needs to be broadened and allow for the active engagement in training, communication and scaling-up.  ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to study plot size variation among <b>potato</b> <b>clones</b> to increase experimental precision of yield performance trials. The experiment was carried out at the experimental area of the Horticulture Dept., UFSM, Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. Tubers of five <b>potato</b> <b>clones</b> were planted in two rows of 60 hills in August 2004. For all ten experimental rows, combined plots were formed adding a different number of adjacent hills of the same row. Soil heterogeneity index and optimum plot size were estimated for each row. Real differences between treatment means for each clone and all clones were estimated using the Hatheway technique. The experimental precision of potato yield trials varied with the evaluated clone because of different optimum plot sizes. Eight-hill plots are the optimum size to quantify yield of <b>potato</b> <b>clones,</b> but experimental precision depends upon adjustments of the number of treatments and replications to the availability of experimental area. Genetic diversity indeed decreases experimental precision and justifies the use of different plot sizes. Practical applicattions and strategies to increase experimental precision of yields performance trials of <b>potato</b> <b>clones</b> are discussed...|$|R
