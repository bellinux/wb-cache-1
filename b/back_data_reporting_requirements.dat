FHWA officials believe that some state departments of transportation will find the analysis that the HERS-ST model produces useful because it demonstrates the potential results of highway investment decisions from an economic point of view. FHWA is conducting a pilot project for its prototype HERS-ST model with states that volunteered to test the model.

40|$|Recreational {{fishing for}} popular species like red snapper and grouper in the Gulf of Mexico has {{followed}} a familiar pattern to that observed in many commercial fisheries: fishing under regulated open access has promoted a “race to the fish” with cascades of shorter seasons, shrinking bag limits, and significant fishery discards.

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} whether practices {{will be ready}} for the <b>data</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> for the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract, using coronary heart disease (CHD) as an example. Design Cross-sectional survey. Data sources Electronic general practitioner (GP) records of all CHD patients in five Scottish practices, validated by manual searches in 50 randomly selected patients in each practice. Main outcome measures Recording of family history, smoking status, blood pressure (BP), diabetes testing, aspirin therapy and cholesterol measurement. Results It is extremely easy for practices with completely electronic patient records to extract a disease register (mean 10 min, range 38 sec to 3 hr 6 min). Extraction of a complete dataset takes several days if it involves checking through paper records, whereas setting up and running a search from electronic records is possible in less than two hours. If practices use the same clinical system and identical data entry templates, the data can be directly compared. Some items that are easily recorded as part of routine clinical practice, such as prescribing of aspirin, are well recorded, but others, such as BP recording, are more of a problem. One hundred percent of the CHD patients sampled had a BP recording within the previous year, but some practices had these data in the paper records where they were not readily accessible. Conclusions We have shown that in Scotland there is a high level of testing and recording of all the important information regarding patients with recorded CHD, irrespective of whether practices have fully electronic records, paper-based records, or a mixture of the two. If practices have fully electronic patient records, the information can be extracted easily, but unless there is a standard template, the information can only be viewed in isolation and is of little value for comparative purposes...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{practices of}} participatory infrastructure monitoring and their {{implications for the}} governance of urban infrastructure services. By introducing the concept of infrastructure legibility, the three essays of this dissertation investigate ways to make waste systems and their governance more legible: its formal structure, its informal practices, interactions between the user and the provider, {{the individual and the}} system. The first essay presents an analysis of the collection and transportation of Municipal Solid Waste and Recycling based on the electronic tracking of individual garbage items. It estimates the extent to which transportation diminishes the benefits of recycling and investigates how predictable the final fate of a discarded object is depending on its material characteristics and the place where it was thrown away. The findings show that the impact of transportation is under-estimated {{especially in the case of}} electronic and household hazardous waste. Furthermore, the collection mechanism assumes a decisive role in this respect. The essay concludes with discussing potentials and limits of active location sensing for making waste systems more legible and accountable. The second essay investigates data collection methodologies for recycling cooperatives in Brazil, answering the following questions: how do waste picker cooperatives and associations respond to <b>data</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> from local governments and companies? In addition, how can available location-based technologies support data management and organization of these recycling cooperatives and associations? Based on the methodology of Participatory Design, the study evaluates technologies for <b>data</b> <b>reporting</b> and the organization of waste picker cooperatives. Using data from citizen feedback systems operating in the larger Boston area, the third essay investigates the role of design in shaping the interaction between the citizens and the city. It investigates the following questions: Which assumptions about the users are embedded in design of existing feedback systems? What motivates users to participate, and how do the systems' design choices correspond with these motivations? By what mechanisms do these systems facilitate and constrain the interaction between citizen and city? The results show that the design differences of feedback systems are associated with different subjects and stated motivations in citizen reports. by Dietmar Offenhuber. Thesis: Ph.

Plants are receptor organisms and direct or indirect vectors for chemical exposures to all other organisms.

The interrelationship between experimental data and model development is an ongoing, never-ending process needed to advance our ability to provide reliable quality information {{that can be used in}} various contexts including regulatory risk assessment.

The median estimated cost per ET service user per year was similar to the annual investment per recipient by several social and human services and workforce development programs that supported low-income individuals to achieve improved economic outcomes.

40|$|Renters {{who remain}} at a {{property}} when {{they no longer}} have a legal right to reside at the location may be sued for unlawful detainer. Most often, an unlawful detainer is filed against a renter who is no longer paying rent but continues to occupy a residence. A person may also be the subject of an unlawful detainer if they commit or allow the commission of illegal activity at a rental property. The Los Angeles City Attorney developed the pilot programs under review in this report to 2 ̆ 2 surgically remove 2 ̆ 2 unlawful detainers who were contributing to illegal activities as a method of counteracting gang and drug problems in neighborhoods. In 1998, the California legislature passed AB 13 84 (Havice, Ch. 613, Statutes of 1998). The pilot programs were based on the program design of the Los Angeles City Attorney. The legislation authorized pilot programs, in selected cities, that empower city attorneys and city prosecutors to evict nuisance tenants when landlords fail to act. The bill authorized a program that allows law enforcement organizations to assist landlords in evicting renters when the landlords fear retaliation from their tenants. Additionally, AB 1384 (Havice) established 2 ̆ 2 partial eviction 2 ̆ 2 provisions in California. This allows the city attorney to evict only the tenant arrested for a drug crime, leaving the 2 ̆ 2 innocent 2 ̆ 2 tenants in the residence. The goals of the pilot programs are to remove drug dealers from neighborhoods and to provide law enforcement with an effective and efficient option for evicting nuisance tenants. Bill AB 1384 and subsequent legislation for the unlawful detainer (U. D.) pilot programs provide for an evaluation of the program to determine if the programs are meeting these goals. This is the fifth report to the legislature on the U. D. program. Prior reports to the legislature submitted by the Judicial Council demonstrated that this program is being used, but have not fully evaluated the merits of this program. Consistent with the requirements of Chapter 613, Statutes of 2009 - 2010, the California Research Bureau (CRB) evaluated the 2010 data on unlawful detainer use and outcomes.
