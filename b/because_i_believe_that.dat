500|$|In 2012 Wilders {{was invited}} by the Q Society of Australia to visit Australia. In August 2012 {{he applied for}} a visa to give two speeches in October 2012. His staff and police {{protection}} officers were granted visas within three days, but Wilders was not. On 2 October 2012 Immigration Minister Chris Bowen, while stating that Wilders' views were offensive, stated {{that he would not}} block the visa application. Bowen stated: [...] "I have decided not to intervene to deny him a visa <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> our democracy is strong enough, our multiculturalism robust enough and our commitment to freedom of speech entrenched enough that our society can withstand the visit of a fringe commentator {{from the other side of}} the world".|$|E
2500|$|On 27 October Dr Giles Fraser {{resigned}} as Canon Chancellor of St Paul's over disagreements on {{the handling of}} the demonstrators, saying [...] "I resigned <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the chapter has set on a course of action that could mean there will be violence {{in the name of the}} church." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his {{maiden speech}} in the House of Commons on 6 July 1983, Blair stated, [...] "I am a socialist not through reading a {{textbook}} that has caught my intellectual fancy, nor through unthinking tradition, but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> at its best, socialism corresponds most closely to an existence that is both rational and moral. It stands for cooperation, not confrontation; for fellowship, not fear. It stands for equality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{then have}} I made you happy? Will you not answer me? <b>I</b> took you <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> you would trust me, and always speak openly from your heart, and hide nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't that," [...] she replied. [...] "He came to visit, me at Eastbourne, and he {{certainly}} knew all the tricks of making himself attractive and agreeable. But he never won my heart--he never even seriously took my fancy. <b>I</b> married him <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> by doing so I was obeying my father's wishes." ...|$|R
5000|$|When former British Home Secretary David Blunkett {{published}} his memoirs in late 2006, {{it was revealed}} he had advised Prime Minister Tony Blair in late March 2003 to bomb the Al Jazeera television transmitter in Baghdad. [...] "There wasn't a worry from me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> this was a war and in a war you wouldn't allow the broadcast to continue taking place", Blunkett said.|$|R
2500|$|Priesand {{retired from}} Monmouth Reform Temple on June 30, 2006, after 25 {{years of service}} to that congregation. She {{explained}} her retirement, saying: “I’m retiring by choice, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> rabbis should know when to leave and when it’s time to inject ‘newness’ into synagogue life.” She intends to remain “a part of the temple family” as rabbi emerita, adding “being here has been the fulfillment of my dream to be a congregational rabbi, which is why I went to rabbinic school in the first place.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, Thiel {{announced}} that he would donate $3.5 million to foster anti-aging research through the Methuselah Mouse Prize foundation. He gave the following reasons for his pledge: [...] "Rapid advances in biological science foretell of a treasure trove of discoveries this century, including dramatically improved health and longevity for all. I’m backing Dr. [...] de Grey, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> his revolutionary approach to aging research will accelerate this process, allowing many people alive today to enjoy radically longer and healthier lives for themselves and their loved ones." ...|$|E
2500|$|Giuliani {{sued the}} federal {{government}} on October 11, 1996 {{for what he called}} unconstitutional provisions against immigrants. [...] In announcing his lawsuit he said, [...] "I believe the anti-immigration movement in America is one of our most serious public problems." [...] He added: [...] "I am speaking out and filing this action <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a threat to immigration can be a threat to the future of our country." [...] Giuliani said that the Immigration and Naturalization Service [...] "do nothing with those names but terrorize people." [...] His lawsuit against the new immigration law claimed that the new federal requirement to report illegal immigrants violated the Tenth Amendment. [...] He said that the law, as well as the Welfare Reform Act, were [...] "inherently unfair." ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{was one of}} only a few Liberal Democrat MPs {{to oppose}} {{allowing}} same sex couples to marry, rebelling against his party in a number of Commons votes on the issue in 2013-14. He has been quoted as saying [...] "Civil partnerships are fine. Gay marriage is just not on" [...] and [...] "I have been against it right from the beginning <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that’s</b> the view of {{the vast majority of people}} in Burnley".|$|R
500|$|The spanking thing started <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> my {{character}} in Dick Tracy liked to get smacked around and that's why she hung around {{with people like}} Al Pacino's character. Warren [...] asked me to write some songs, one of them, the Hanky Panky song, was about that. I say in the song 'Nothing like a good spanky', {{and in the middle}} I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts just thinking about it'. When it came out everybody started asking, 'Do you like to get spanked?' and I said: 'Yeah. Yeah, I do'.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was nothing}} tactless about it," [...] he assured her. [...] "It {{makes it much}} {{easier for me to}} tell you. I married my wife {{thirteen}} years ago <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> her wealth would help me in my career. She married me because she was an American with ambitions, anxious to find a definite place in English society. She has been disappointed in me. Other circumstances have now presented themselves. I have discovered that my wife's affections are bestowed elsewhere. To be perfectly honest, the discovery was a relief to me." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "It {{was in the}} perilous {{fires of}} the Carter {{administration}} that my ideology was forged," [...] she wrote. [...] "In the seventies, Carter taught me what I was against, {{and then in the}} eighties, Reagan taught me what I was for." [...] She also details why she {{went to work for the}} Internal Revenue Service. She says it was because she wanted to change the tax code, [...] "from the inside out." [...] She also commented on her role as a Tea Party leader. [...] "I once said that the Tea Party represents 90 percent of Americans. I now realize that I misspoke," [...] she admitted. [...] "I should have said 100 percent, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> nearly all Americans retain faith in the ordered liberty that the Constitution offers." ...|$|E
2500|$|On The O'Reilly Factor and on {{his former}} talk-radio program, O'Reilly focused on news and {{commentary}} related to politics and culture. O'Reilly has long said {{that he does not}} identify with any political ideology, writing in his book The O'Reilly Factor that the reader [...] "might be wondering whether I'm conservative, liberal, libertarian, or exactly what... See, I don't want to fit any of those labels, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the truth doesn't have labels. When I see corruption, I try to expose it. When I see exploitation, I try to fight it. That's my political position." [...] On December 6, 2000, the Daily News in New York reported, however, that he had been registered with the Republican Party in the state of New York since 1994. When questioned about this, {{he said that he was}} not aware of it and says he registered as an independent after the interview. During a broadcast of The Radio Factor, O'Reilly said that there was no option to register as an independent voter; however, there was in fact a box marked [...] "I do not wish to enroll in party." [...] Despite his being registered as an Independence Party member, many view him as a conservative figure. A February 2009 Pew Research poll found that 66% of his television viewers identify themselves as conservative, 24% moderate, and 3% liberal. A November 2008 poll by Zogby International found that O'Reilly was the second most trusted news personality, after Rush Limbaugh.|$|E

50|$|After living 17 {{years in}} Valparaiso, Ampuero moved in 1972 {{to the capital}} of the country, Santiago, to matriculate into the University of Chile. There he studied Social Anthropology in the mornings and Latin American Literature in the afternoons. Around this time, he {{became a member of the}} Chilean Communist Youth. He says that “When I was young, I was a part of the Communist Youth <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the {{socialism}} was democratic, just, and economically prosperous.” After the coup d’etat at the end of December in 1973, he decided to depart for Eastern Germany.|$|R
30|$|I {{thought that}} {{modeling}} is {{waste of time}} before this course, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn’t <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> my students could be creative in this way. My opinions changed after this course, because we saw some examples of experiments including scientific practices.|$|R

6000|$|... "I am {{not going}} to discuss anything, Dr Fillgrave; I say I am sorry for it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{prudence}} will imperatively require Lady Arabella to have Doctor Thorne back again. Now, if you would not object to meet him--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now after Mameena {{was dead}} I bethought me that I would rear up {{a woman who}} could still love but should never love a man and {{therefore}} never become mad or foolish, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> it was only man who in taking her heart from woman, would take her wits also. This child, Nombe, came to my hand, and as I thought, so I did. Never mind how I did it, by medicine perhaps, by magic perhaps, by watering her pride and making it grow tall perhaps, or by all three. At least it was done, and this I know of Nombe, she will never care for any man except as a woman may care for a brother.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he repeated. [...] "But it isn't <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't {{think our}} Unionists and their opponents aren't foolish enough for {{anything}} of the sort. It's only <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Germans are so stupid as to do such things.... Why should they?...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not in}} a good-natured mood. I {{assure you}} I found the fact disagreeable when it was thrust on me--all the more, or perhaps all the less, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> then <b>that</b> your heart was pledged to the duchess. But now, {{confound}} you! you {{turn out to be}} in love in the right place--a Jew--and everything eligible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wrong me. I {{could never}} do like that. You {{tell me that he}} loves me;--but what if I do not love him? Love will not be constrained. Am I to say that I love him <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he loves me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Louise, you and I {{have few}} secrets from each other. I {{would have killed}} Dorward to obtain that sealed envelope, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the {{knowledge}} of its contents in London to-day would save us from disaster. To know how far each is pledged, and from which direction the first blow is to come, would be our salvation." ...|$|E
60|$|The Mensur {{has been}} {{described}} so often and so thoroughly that I {{do not intend to}} bore my readers with any detailed account of it. I merely come forward as an impressionist, and I write purposely the impression of my first Mensur, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> first impressions are more true and useful than opinions blunted by intercourse, or shaped by influence.|$|E
40|$|Gypsy Soul, Wolf Spirit is a {{collection}} of thirty-six poems; the majority of the poems are written in - or evolved from drafts written in - iambic pentameter. Writing formal poetry was a challenge I decided to embrace <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> it would allow me to evolve as a poet. The themes that connect these poems are represented by the collection 2 ̆ 7 s title: Gypsy Soul, Wolf Spirit. There is the dominant thematic presence of both the natural world and the spiritual realm within the collection. My intention was to lift the reader to a state of mind, through language, where he or she could get lost in the peaceful beauty of nature - even when that beauty is found through powerful images of the bear or wolf - and feel the spontaneous gypsy soul of the divine universe...|$|R

5000|$|Jean Thesman (1929-2016) was {{a popular}} and award-winning novelist for young adults whose {{predominant}} theme was the heroine finding {{her place in the}} world by coming to understand her family.

[...] —Emily Shepherd ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Sir Baron. I cease not {{to think}} that nothing {{would be so much}} for your good. It is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a return to your own old castle will best {{convince}} you all that I will not vex your mother by further opposing your departure. When you perceive your error may it only not be too late! Such a protector is not to be found every day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I see {{you have}} taken your resolutions, gentlemen,' said Redgauntlet; 'unwisely I think, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> by softer and more generous proceedings, {{you would have been}} more likely to carry a point which I think as {{desirable}} as you do.

60|$|I {{write down}} these {{opinions}} not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{this or any}} other thing was so because I thought so, but only because I did think so and I want to be quite candid about all I thought and did. These were my thoughts about Richard. I thought I often observed besides how right my guardian was in what he had said, and that the uncertainties and delays of the Chancery suit had imparted to his nature something of the careless spirit of a gamester who felt that he was part of a great gaming system.|$|E
