500|$|Robert Hilburn {{from the}} Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "Madonna {{represents}} a contemporary fantasy figure that revives the glamour, innocence and raw sexuality {{of many of}} Madonna's own teen heroes, including Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. Like the early Monroe, Madonna may portray a bimbo, but there she's clearly no pushover. Though the audience was on its feet throughout, it often seemed that Madonna was operating beneath her potential in this pop format. It's important to demonstrate that she can handle herself live, but the simplicity of pop concerts doesn't begin to tax her ambition or talent. In fact, she has so little to do other than express this aggressive, sexy attitude that the show seemed long at just over an hour. Heidi Sherman from Spin commented, [...] "The Virgin Tour was Madonna's first, yet it {{put her in the}} same league as Prince and Bruce Springsteen. It proved that Madonna was beyond real. And if her stage presence indicated she was more showgirl than musician, at least she knew how to gussy up her act for the postfeminist MTV age. Boy Toy? Not exactly.

Dubbing the character [...] "a <b>bonafide</b> feminist warrior", Daily Life Ruby Hamad praised Clair for teaching her [...] "that a woman is no less of a woman, {{a mother and a}} wife for working." [...] Slate critic Jason Bailey observed that, during The Cosby Shows initial run, critics and audiences were too busy commenting on the race of the sitcom's main characters to notice that Cosby had imbued his series with [...] "proud and vocal feminism" [...] in the form of Clair. According to Bailey, The Cosby Show was not only successful because Clair [...] "was a strong, liberated woman with a career"; she also [...] "had a husband and family who supported and valued her endeavors." [...] Dubbing Clair's influence on pop culture as [...] "one of TV’s great feminists" [...] the [...] "Other Huxtable Effect", Bailey concluded that the character's impact remains indisputable despite Cosby's recent sexual assault allegations, and thus maintains that The Cosby Shows legacy as a feminist series should not be discredited.|$|E

Though {{the facts of the}} article were invented by Rushmore, by coincidence the FBI was conducting its own investigation on the same matter. Initially, J.

Later in Olympia, Washington, Rushmore testified before the Canwell Committee, a state committee to investigate subversive activities at the University of Washington. Rushmore switched the subject to Washington, D.C. He waved a piece of paper that he claimed was an FBI report that named 150 federal employees that were members of a Soviet spy ring. When FBI agents intercepted him in a hotel lobby and asked about the document, he showed them a four-page letter that he typed himself. Then in the spring of 1953, Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy asked Hoover about Rushmore's <b>bonafides.</b> The FBI's reply warned against relying on Rushmore's veracity. [...] " [...] writings have proved unreliable, due to his tendency to sensationalize and blow up fragments of information."

David Corey, program director of WXKS-FM, described the feat as [...] "very rare". Just before the release of her third studio album, Davis also stated that {{she was one of the}} top four artists at Sony BMG. According to Seattle Post-Intelligencer, [...] "the turning point for Idols credibility may have been the success of Clarkson's sophomore album, released in 2004. While her first album, released soon after her win on [...] "Idol," [...] was a platinum success, it only generated two hit singles and her success seemed tied into her newfound fame.

[...] Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal commented on the episode [...] "Preggers", [...] "Rachel has become insufferable.

[...] Eric Goldman for IGN agreed, [...] "It's hard not to be annoyed by Rachel". James Poniewozik of Time has suggested that Rachel's negative character traits may actually be an asset, commenting on her performance of [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade" [...] in the episode [...] "Sectionals", [...] "The number reminded me how much I like what the show's done with Rachel: she's a lead character, yet the show allows her to be annoying—but at the same time, her dedication makes her likeable.

On American Bandstand, Madonna performed the track [...] "Holiday" [...] and told interviewer Dick Clark that she wanted [...] "to rule the world." [...] John Mitchell from MTV said that the appearance [...] "remains {{one of her most}} legendary." [...] The album's singles were later performed on The Virgin Tour in 1985. It was Madonna's first concert tour and visited North American dates. The Virgin Tour received mixed reception from critics, but was a commercial success.

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} theoretical <b>bonafides</b> for implicit concurrent multivariate effect evaluation [...] implicit concurrency {{for short}} [...] -a broad and versatile computational learning efficiency thought to underlie general-purpose, non-local, noise-tolerant optimization in genetic algorithms with uniform crossover (UGAs). We demonstrate that implicit concurrency {{is indeed a}} form of efficient learning by showing {{that it can be}} used to obtain close-to-optimal bounds on the time and queries required to approximately correctly solve a constrained version (k= 7, η= 1 / 5) of a recognizable computational learning problem: learning parities with noisy membership queries. We argue that a UGA that treats the noisy membership query oracle as a fitness function can be straightforwardly used to approximately correctly learn the essential attributes in O(log^ 1. 585 n) queries and O(n log^ 1. 585 n) time, where n is the total number of attributes. Our proof relies on an accessible symmetry argument and the use of statistical hypothesis testing to reject a global null hypothesis at the 10 ^- 100 level of significance. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first relatively rigorous identification of efficient computational learning in an evolutionary algorithm on a non-trivial learning problem.

Martín Caballero of USA Today said, [...] "The ex-Floetry singer has never matched the sales success of peers such as Alicia Keys or Mary J.

[...] Anupa Mistry of Spin stated, [...] "Like the cover of Portishead's [...] "Sour Times" [...] on Late Nights, a do-over anchors Friends & Lovers: Sade's [...] "Stronger Than Pride," [...] featuring a brawny verse from Dr. Dre, and set to the stark drip of DJ Premier's beat for Jeru the Damaja's [...] "Come Clean." [...] She might have taken the rap <b>bonafides</b> a bit too far with [...] "Stronger" [...] - especially considering she's respected enough to cover Sade - {{but much of the}} rest of Friends & Lovers is grown and sexy cool." [...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic said, [...] "Had it not been for fellow English singer Adele's 21, Late Nights & Early Mornings would have topped the Billboard 200 the week after its 2011 release date. Marsha Ambrosius' solo debut had staying power, too. One of its singles, [...] "Far Away," [...] was nominated for two Grammy Awards. While she continued to make occasional guest appearances, highlighted by spots on Robert Glasper Experiment's [...] "Trust" [...] and Daley's [...] "Alone Together," [...] Ambrosius took her time with Friends & Lovers.
