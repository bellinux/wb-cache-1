His uncle did not tell him that night where his <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> gone, for fear that Copley might make some difficulty, by insisting on going on after him in the diligence with Thomas.

5|$|In 1992 {{the sons}} of Miguel Vázquez were {{introduced}} to the wrestling world as Espanto IV and Espanto V, forming a regular tag team in and around Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. The duo lost their masks to the team of Blue Fish and Mongol Chino, although the team of Stuka and Stuka Jr. is also credited with unmasking them. It is possible that Espanto IV and V agreed to lose their masks to both teams, but in different locations in Mexico. Before the internet there were examples of luchadors getting an additional payment for losing their mask on multiple occasions. The <b>brothers</b> <b>have</b> worked for various Mexican promotions and toured Japan while working for the Japanese Universal Wrestling Federation and Michinoku Pro. In Japan they unsuccessfully challenged the Great Sasuke and Gran Hamada for the UWA/UWF Intercontinental Tag Team Championship.|$|E

5|$|According to Jain texts, Bahubali {{was born}} to Rishabhanatha and Sunanda during the Ikshvaku dynasty in Ayodhya. He {{is said to have}} excelled in {{studying}} medicine, archery, floriculture, and the knowledge of precious gems. Bahubali had a son named Somakirti (also known as Mahabala). When Rishabhanatha decided to become a monk, he distributed his kingdom among his 100 sons. Bharata was gifted the kingdom of Vinita (Ayodhya) and Bahubali got the kingdom of Asmaka from South India, having Podanapur as its capital. After winning six divisions of earth in all directions (digvijaya), Bharata proceeded to his capital Ayodhyapuri with a huge army and divine chakra-ratna—spinning, disk-like super weapon with serrated edges. But the chakra-ratna stopped on its own at the entrance of Ayodhyapuri, signalling to the emperor that his 99 <b>brothers</b> <b>have</b> yet not submitted to his authority. Bharata's 98 brothers became Jain monks' and submitted their kingdoms to him. Bahubali was endowed with the final and superior body of extraordinary sturdiness and strength (vajra-ṛṣabhanārācasaṃhanana) like Bharata. He hurled open defiance at the chakravartin and challenged him to a fight.|$|E
5|$|The Briscoe <b>Brothers</b> <b>have</b> {{wrestled}} most extensively for Ring of Honor. Jay wrestled on ROH's first-ever show, The Era of Honor Begins, {{losing to}} Amazing Red. Mark seconded {{him to the}} ring but could not wrestle because of Pennsylvania's child labor law (most of ROH's earliest shows took place in Philadelphia). Jay wrestled each of ROH's next four shows, against Spanky, Tony Mamaluke, Doug Williams, and James Maritato, losing to all but Mamaluke. At Honor Invades Boston, when Mark was able to perform, he defeated his brother, in the second-to-last match of the night. The Brothers went on briefly to feud against each other, during which time Jay scored a non-title win over ROH Champion Xavier at Glory By Honor. This earned him a title shot at All-Star Extravaganza, {{which he did not}} win. At Scramble Madness, back in Boston, the brothers' storyline involved them picking their own partners for a tag team match. Jay picked past foe Amazing Red, whereas Mark's partner was Christopher Daniels, as he seemingly joined The Prophecy. Daniels pinned Red to win the match. The Brothers' feud against one another concluded at the First Anniversary Show, when Jay defeated Mark in a match, and the two hugged afterward to signify their reunion. Mark never explicitly left the Prophecy, but in forming a team with his brother, he stopped teaming with them.|$|E
