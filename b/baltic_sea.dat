5|$|By {{the time}} the Livonian War broke out, the Hanseatic League had already lost its {{monopoly}} on the profitable and prosperous <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> trade. While still involved and with increasing sales, it now shared the market with European mercenary fleets, most notably from the Dutch Seventeen Provinces and France. The Hanseatic vessels were no match for contemporary warships, and since the league was unable to maintain a large navy because of a declining share of trade, its Livonian members Riga, Reval and trading partner Narva were left without suitable protection. The Danish navy, the most powerful in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea,</b> controlled {{the entrance to the}} <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea,</b> collected requisite tolls, and held the strategically important <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> islands of Bornholm and Gotland.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Carl {{served with}} the fleet until 1 March 1909, when she was {{withdrawn}} {{for use as a}} torpedo training ship. She served in this capacity until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, when she was again placed in active service with the cruiser division in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea.</b> In October 1914, Friedrich Carl was the first German warship to carry seaplanes. The ship carried two planes provisionally and had no permanent modifications made to support them. She was made the flagship of Rear Admiral Behring, the commander of the German cruiser squadron in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea.</b> The squadron was based in Neufahrwasser in Danzig. The German naval command was aware that British submarines were operating in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea,</b> and so ordered Behring to attack the Russian port at Libau to prevent it from being used as a British submarine base.|$|E
5|$|A trade {{treaty was}} signed between the Commonwealth and Prussia, {{unfavorable}} to the Commonwealth. The Partition {{cut off the}} Commonwealth's access to the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea,</b> and the state {{had no choice but}} to accept the high tariffs imposed by Prussia.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s Mnemiopsis {{appeared}} in the Caspian Sea. Beroe ovata arrived shortly after, {{and is expected to}} reduce but not eliminate the impact of Mnemiopsis there. Mnemiopsis also reached the eastern Mediterranean in the late 1990s and now appears to be thriving in the North Sea and <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{streams and}} 11,000 lakes {{are found in}} Belarus. Three major rivers run through the country: the Neman, the Pripyat, and the Dnieper. The Neman flows westward towards the <b>Baltic</b> <b>sea</b> and the Pripyat flows eastward to the Dnieper; the Dnieper flows southward towards the Black Sea.|$|E

5|$|The {{airport is}} also home to a small Royal Danish Air Force detachment, {{maintaining}} a helicopter based search-and-rescue service covering Zealand and the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea.</b> Military passenger services have occasionally used the airport.

5|$|The species easily {{attaches}} {{itself to}} stones, which {{allows it to}} live in fast-running waters and in wave zone in lakes. The ability of Theodoxus fluviatilis to live in freshwater and also in brackish water demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity of this species. This small snail can live in up to 60 m depth in coastal waters. Brackish water populations can live in salinities of up to 15‰ in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> or up to 18‰ in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> and in Black Sea. Populations from brackish water can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater. Brackish water populations have much higher accumulation of ninhydrin-positive substances in the foot.|$|E

40|$|The project conducts application-oriented {{research}} on impacts of underwater noise on marine vertebrates in the North and <b>Baltic</b> <b>Seas.</b> In distinct subprojects, the hearing sensitivity of harbor porpoises and gray seals {{as well as}} the acoustic tolerance limit of harbor porpoises to impulsive noise from pile driving and stress reactions caused by anthropogenic noise is investigated. Animals are equipped with DTAGs capable of recording the actual surrounding noise field of free-swimming harbor porpoises and seals. Acoustic noise mapping including porpoise detectors in the Natura 2000 sites of the North and <b>Baltic</b> <b>Seas</b> will help to fully understand current noise impacts. </p...|$|R

5|$|After 4500 BCE the Ertebølle {{culture of}} northwestern origin entered a ceramic phase {{with its own}} forms of pottery (characteristic pointed bottoms). They lived by the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> shores and were {{specialized}} in utilizing {{the resources of the}} sea, thus still representing the Mesolithic ways of life. At their settlement in Dąbki near Koszalin Stroke-ornamented pottery was found, obtained probably through trade with the Danubian people.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Plymouth after the Armistice was signed, Parker carried mail and passengers between Plymouth and Brest. She made a cruise to German ports in early 1919 {{to implement the}} terms of the armistice, before steaming to the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> to assist members and vessels of the American Relief Administration. Parker sailed for New York on 20 July 1919 and, upon arrival, was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 1, Atlantic Fleet.|$|E

50|$|In 1898 {{the first}} Freikörperkultur club {{was founded in}} Essen. In 1900 more and more Swedish baths arose in rooms in Berlin and on the North and <b>Baltic</b> <b>seas</b> and a naturist {{movement}} began in France.|$|R
5|$|At the time, {{the forces}} of the Swedish Empire {{dominated}} Northern Germany, and along with her ally France, Sweden became guarantee power of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The Swedish aim of controlling the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> by establishing dominions on the coastline ("dominium maris baltici") thwarted Frederick William's ambitions to gain control over the Oder estuary with Stettin (now Szczecin) in Pomerania.|$|E
5|$|C.maenas is {{native to}} European and North African coasts {{as far as the}} <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> in the east, and Iceland and Central Norway in the north, {{and is one of the}} most common crabs {{throughout}} much of its range.

The <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> was, however, an extremely dangerous escape route. In all, 189people are estimated to have died attempting to flee via the Baltic.|$|E
50|$|Although Haparanda has a boat harbor, {{it is not}} {{accessible}} for larger vessels and is not, as often thought, the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea's</b> northernmost port, that honor most probably belonging to Töre further west on the Swedish coast.|$|R
50|$|Designed in 1855, the Intrepid-class gunvessels were {{intended}} {{to serve in the}} shallow waters of the Black and <b>Baltic</b> <b>seas</b> during the Crimean War. They were built quickly, and of inferior wood, which explains their short lifespan of 10 years.|$|R

5|$|German {{submarine}} U-36 was a Type VIIA U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine {{which served}} during World War II. She {{was constructed in}} {{the earliest days of}} the U-boat arm at Kiel in 1936, and served in the pre-war Navy in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> and North Sea under Kapitänleutnant (Kptlt.) Klaus Ewerth. Korvettenkapitän (K.Kapt.)Wilhelm Fröhlich took command in October 1938 and continued in the role until the boat was lost.|$|E
5|$|Hela was {{the first}} German ship sunk by a British {{submarine}} in the war.

5|$|Homarus gammarus {{is found}} across the {{north-eastern}} Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco, {{not including the}} <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea.</b> It is also present {{in most of the}} Mediterranean Sea, only missing from the section east of Crete, and along only the north-west coast of the Black Sea. The northernmost populations are found in the Norwegian fjords Tysfjorden and Nordfolda, inside the Arctic Circle.|$|E
50|$|During {{planning}} and construction stages {{the project was}} criticized by environmentalists, {{mainly because of the}} <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea's</b> status as a particularly sensitive sea area and Primorsk’s proximity to the Beryozovye Islands nature reserve, a major bird sanctuary protected by the Ramsar Convention.|$|R
50|$|German cities {{achieved}} {{domination of}} {{trade in the}} Baltic with striking speed during the 13th century, and Lübeck became a central node in the seaborne trade that linked the areas around the North and <b>Baltic</b> <b>seas.</b> The hegemony of Lübeck peaked during the 15th century.|$|R
50|$|An adder {{stone is}} a type of stone, usually glassy, with a {{naturally}} occurring hole through it. Such stones have been discovered by archaeologists in both Britain and Egypt. Commonly, they are found in Northern Germany at the coasts of the North and <b>Baltic</b> <b>Seas.</b>|$|R
