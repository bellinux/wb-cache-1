25|$|A {{cardinal}} <b>B-spline</b> has {{a constant}} separation, h, between knots. The cardinal B-splines {{for a given}} order n are just shifted copies of each other. They {{can be obtained from}} the simpler definition.|$|E
40|$|We {{extend the}} notion of complex <b>B-splines</b> to a multivariate setting by {{employing}} the relationship between ordinary <b>B-splines</b> and multivariate <b>B-splines</b> by means of ridge functions. In order to obtain properties of complex <b>B-splines</b> in R s, 1 < s ∈ N, the Dirichlet average has to be generalized to include infinite dimensional simplices.

25|$|Fast <b>b-spline</b> {{interpolation}} on {{a uniform}} sample domain {{can be done}} by iterative mean-filtering. Alternatively, a rectangle function equals Sinc in Fourier domain. Therefore, cubic spline interpolation equals multiplying the signal in Fourier domain with Sinc^4.|$|E
25|$|In the {{mathematical}} subfield of numerical analysis, a <b>B-spline,</b> or basis spline, is a spline function that has minimal support {{with respect to}} a given degree, smoothness, and domain partition. Any spline function of given degree can be expressed as a linear combination of B-splines of that degree. Cardinal B-splines have knots that are equidistant from each other. B-splines can be used for curve-fitting and numerical differentiation of experimental data.|$|E
25|$|Texture mapping is {{a method}} for adding detail, surface texture, or colour to a computer-generated graphic or 3D model. Its {{application}} to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr Edwin Catmull in 1974. A texture map is applied (mapped) {{to the surface of}} a shape, or polygon. This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box. Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon. Procedural textures (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture), and bitmap textures (created in an image editing application or imported from a digital camera) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing texture definition on 3D models in computer graphics software, while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as UV mapping (arbitrary, manual layout of texture coordinates) for polygon surfaces, while non-uniform rational <b>B-spline</b> (NURB) surfaces have their own intrinsic parameterization used as texture coordinates. Texture mapping as a discipline also encompasses techniques for creating normal maps and bump maps that correspond to a texture to simulate height and specular maps to help simulate shine and light reflections, as well as environment mapping to simulate mirror-like reflectivity, also called gloss.|$|E
40|$|A fast {{algorithm}} for <b>B-splines</b> {{in mixed}} models is presented. <b>B-splines</b> have local support and are computational attractive, because the corresponding matrices are sparse. A {{key element of}} the new algorithm is that the local character of <b>B-splines</b> is preserved, while in other existing methods this local character is lost. The computation time for the fast algorithm is linear {{in the number of}} <b>B-splines,</b> while computation time scales cubically for existing transformations...|$|R

Moreover, generalized <b>B-splines</b> possess all fundamental properties of algebraic <b>B-splines</b> (and NURBS) including classical refinement processes as h-. p-. k refinements.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new kind}} of splines, called non-uniform algebraic-trigonometric <b>B-splines</b> (NUAT <b>B-splines),</b> generated over the space spanned by { 1,t, [...] .,tk− 3, cos t,sin t} in which k is an arbitrary integer larger than or equal to 3. We show that the NUAT <b>B-splines</b> share most properties of the usual polynomial <b>B-splines.</b> The subdivision formulae of this new kind of curves are given. The generation of tensor product surfaces by these new splines is straightforward...|$|R
2500|$|For each finite knot {{interval}} {{where it}} is non-zero, a <b>B-spline</b> is a polynomial of degree [...] A <b>B-spline</b> is a continuous function at the knots. [...] When all knots belonging to the <b>B-spline</b> are distinct, its derivatives are also continuous up to the derivative of degree [...] If the knots are coincident at a given value of , the continuity of derivative order is reduced by 1 for each additional coincident knot. B-splines may share a subset of their knots, but two B-splines defined over the exact same knots are identical. In other words, a <b>B-spline</b> is uniquely defined by its knots.|$|E
2500|$|<b>B-spline</b> {{function}} {{is a combination}} of flexible bands that passes through the number of points that are called control points and creates smooth curves. These functions enable the creation and management of complex shapes and surfaces using a number of points. <b>B-spline</b> function and Bezier functions are applied extensively in shape optimization methods. A <b>B-spline</b> of order [...] is a piecewise polynomial function of degree [...] in a variable [...] It is defined over [...] locations , called knots or breakpoints, which must be in non-descending order [...] The <b>B-spline</b> contributes only in the range between the first and last of these knots and is zero elsewhere.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} interpolating a continuous-time signal from a set of uniformly spaced discrete-time samples. One of the prime methods of interpolation {{is based on the}} use of uniform <b>B-splines.</b> In this paper, we introduce a new interpolation approach using nonuniform <b>B-splines</b> as interpolation kernels. We show both theoretically, and through simulation results, that using nonuniform <b>B-splines</b> for interpolation of a signal from uniform samples can result in a higher quality of interpolation with respect to uniform <b>B-splines,</b> at the same computational cost. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{adaptive}} parametrization scheme for dynamic mesh refinement {{in the application}} of parametric image registration. The scheme is based on a refinement measure ensuring that the control points give an efficient representation of the warp fields, in terms of minimizing the registration cost function. In the current work we introduce multivariate <b>B-splines</b> as a novel alternative to the widely used tensor <b>B-splines</b> enabling us to make efficient use of the derived measure. The multivariate <b>B-splines</b> of order n are C n− 1 smooth and are based on Delaunay configurations of arbitrary 2 D or 3 D control point sets. Efficient algorithms for finding the configurations are presented, and <b>B-splines</b> are through their flexibility shown to feature several advantages over the tensor <b>B-splines.</b> In spite of efforts to make the tensor product <b>B-splines</b> more flexible, the knots are still bound to reside on a regular grid. In contrast, by efficient nonconstrained placement of the knots, the multivariate <b>B-splines</b> are shown to give a good representation of inhomogeneous objects in natural settings. The wide applicability of the method is illustrated through its application on medical data and for optical flow estimation. 1...|$|R

The resulting surface is both accurate and smooth [...] The approximating surface is a linear combination of tensor-product cubic <b>B-splines.</b> So, the coefficients of the tensor-product <b>B-splines</b> define the reconstructed surface. Since tensor-product cubic (quadratic) <b>B-splines</b> are non-zero only for four (three) knot-intervals in the x-direction and y-direction, the elevation at any point can be found in constant time and a grid DEM can be generated from the coefficients of the <b>B-splines</b> in time linear {{in the size of the}} grid. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{equations}} {{that govern}} Kirchhoff–Love plate theory are solved using quadratic Powell–Sabin <b>B-splines</b> and unstructured standard T-splines. Bézier extraction is exploited {{to make the}} formulation computationally efficient. Because quadratic Powell–Sabin <b>B-splines</b> result in -continuous shape functions, they are of sufficiently high continuity to capture Kirchhoff–Love plate theory when cast in a weak form. Unlike non-uniform rational <b>B-splines</b> (NURBS), which are commonly used in isogeometric analysis, Powell–Sabin <b>B-splines</b> do not necessarily capture the geometry exactly. However, {{the fact that they}} are defined on triangles instead of on quadrilaterals increases their flexibility in meshing and can make them competitive with respect to NURBS, as no bending strip method for joined NURBS patches is needed. This paper further illustrates how unstructured T-splines can be modified such that they are -continuous around extraordinary points, and that the blending functions fulfil the partition of unity property. The performance of quadratic NURBS, unstructured T-splines, Powell–Sabin <b>B-splines</b> and NURBS-to-NURPS (non-uniform rational Powell–Sabin <b>B-splines,</b> which are obtained by a transformation from a NURBS patch) is compared in a study of a circular plate...|$|R
