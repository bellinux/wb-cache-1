2500|$|In {{probability}} and statistics, a Bernoulli {{process is}} a finite or infinite sequence of binary random variables, {{so it is a}} discrete-time stochastic process that takes only two values, canonically 0 and1. The component Bernoulli variables X'i are identically distributed and independent. [...] Prosaically, a Bernoulli {{process is a}} repeated coin flipping, possibly with an unfair coin (but with consistent unfairness). [...] Every variable X'i in the sequence is associated with a <b>Bernoulli</b> <b>trial</b> or experiment. They all have the same Bernoulli distribution. Much of what can be said about the Bernoulli process can also be generalized to more than two outcomes (such as the process for a six-sided die); this generalization is known as the Bernoulli scheme.|$|E
2500|$|The rate of {{an event}} {{is related to the}} {{probability}} {{of an event}} occurring in some small subinterval (of time, space or otherwise). In the case of the Poisson distribution, one assumes that there exists a small enough subinterval for which the probability of an event occurring twice is [...] "negligible". With this assumption one can derive the Poisson distribution from the Binomial one, given only the information of expected number of total events in the whole interval. Let this total number be [...] Divide the whole interval into [...] subintervals [...] of equal size, such that [...] > [...] (since we are interested in only very small portions of the interval this assumption is meaningful).
