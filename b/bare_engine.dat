5000|$|The Star Bird manual {{describes}} it as [...] "THE AMAZING SPACESHIP with realistic engine sounds and flashing laser blasts". The toy was constructed in three main pieces: the front inner hull which held the electronics and front lasers, the front outer hull (a thin plastic shell over the inner hull), the main body consisting of the center stalk like section and wings. A molded plastic engine piece fitted into {{the rear of the}} main body and was removable. The toy is only used in three configurations: the Star Bird which consists of all available pieces, the Star Bird Fighter which is mostly only the front hull attached to the <b>bare</b> <b>engine</b> piece, and the Star Bird Orbiter which is the main body without the front outer hull. When turned on the Star Bird mimics an engine sound. If the toy is pointed upwards the sound would be altered by a ball bearing switch to imply a doppler effect acceleration or taking-off, while a nose down orientation gives the sound of decelerating engines. A button {{at the rear of the}} cockpit activates the LEDs at the front of the toy, along with a blast noise, to simulate the firing of its lasers. The button was designed to be pressed by the thumb while the ship was held by the main body or engine piece (in [...] "dragster" [...] configuration). Two simple, detachable drone-like [...] "Interceptors" [...] are provided at the end of each wing. Star Bird also had a rotating laser turret which doubled as an escape-pod/orbiter-type ship. Very much to the dismay of current-day collectors the twin lasers from the turret are often missing in today's offerings of the play set.|$|E
40|$|The overall {{process of}} low-noise engine design is outlined. Computational {{techniques}} {{for the analysis}} of engine noise are considered: the finite element method for the vibratory analysis of the engine structure, the boundary element method for the acoustic analysis of the <b>bare</b> <b>engine</b> and the boundary and shell element method for the prediction of the effect of noise shields. Results from the application of the techniques to an engine-like structure or to test problems are given...|$|E

50|$|In 1963 a new {{premises}} {{was built}} in the outskirts of Reggio Emilia which marked the transition to large scale production. Taking advantage of the tumultuous growth of the Italian economy and of the ever increasing demand for agricultural machinery, Lombardini enjoyed a long and steady expansion resulting in the company becoming a leader in small agricultural equipment. At this stage the company decided to abandon production of finished products in order to focus on <b>bare</b> <b>engines</b> alone. This change reflected a strategic decision of the company not to compete against their own customers.|$|R
40|$|Engine fan {{diameter}} and Bypass Ratio (BPR) optimization {{studies have been}} conducted {{since the beginning of the}} turbofan age with the recognition that reducing the engine core jet velocity and increasing fan mass flow rate generally increases propulsive efficiency. However, performance tradeoffs limit the amount of fan flow achievable without reducing airplane efficiency. This study identifies the optimum engine fan {{diameter and}} BPR, given the advanced Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) powerplant efficiencies, for use on an advanced subsonic airframe. Engine diameter studies have historically focused on specific engine size options, and were limited by existing technology and transportation infrastructure (e. g., ability to fit <b>bare</b> <b>engines</b> through aircraft doors and into cargo holds). This study is unique in defining the optimum fan diameter and drivers for future 2015 (UEET) powerplants while not limiting engine fan diameter by external constraints. This report follows on to a study identifying the system integration issues of UEET engines. This Engine Diameter study was managed by Boeing Phantom Works, Seattle, Washington through the NASA Glenn Revolutionary Aero Space Engine Research (RASER) contract under task order 10. Boeing Phantom Works, Huntington Beach, completed the engine/airplane sizing optimization, while the Boeing Commercial Airplane group (BCA) provided design oversight. A separate subcontract to support the overall project was issued to Tuskegee University...|$|R
40|$|The Weight Analysis of Turbine Engines (WATE) {{computer}} code {{was developed by}} Boeing under contract to NASA Lewis. It was designed to function {{as an adjunct to}} the Navy/NASA Engine Program (NNEP). NNEP calculates the design and off-design thrust and sfc performance of User defined engine cycles. The thermodynamic parameters throughout the engine as generated by NNEP are then combined with input parameters defining the component characteristics in WATE to calculate the <b>bare</b> <b>engine</b> weight of this User defined engine. Preprocessor programs for NNEP were previously developed to simplify the task of creating input datasets. This report describes a similar preprocessor for the WATE code...|$|E
40|$|The design, analysis, fabrication, {{and ground}} and flight testing of DC- 9 airframe/nacelle {{hardware}} with prototype JT 8 D- 109 engines are discussed. The {{installation of the}} JT 8 D- 109 engine on the DC- 9 Refan airplane required new or modified hardware for the pylon, nacelle, and fuselage. The acoustic material used in the nose cowl was bonded aluminum honeycomb sandwich and the exhaust duct acoustic material was Inconel 625 Stresskin. The sea level static, standard day <b>bare</b> <b>engine</b> takeoff thrust, the cruise TSFC and the maximum available cruise thrust for the JT 8 D- 109 engine were {{compared with those of}} the JT 8 D- 9 engine. The range capabilities of the DC- 9 Refan and the production DC- 9 airplane were also compared. The Refan airplane demonstrated flight characteristics similar to the production DC- 9 - 30 and satisfied airworthiness requirements. Flyover noise levels were determined for the DC- 9 Refan and the DC- 9 C- 9 A airplane for takeoff and landing conditions. Cost estimates were also made...|$|E
40|$|The JT 8 D- 109 engine has a {{sea level}} static, {{standard}} day <b>bare</b> <b>engine</b> takeoff thrust of 73, 840 N. At sea level standard day conditions the additional {{thrust of the}} JT 8 D- 109 results in 2, 040 kg additional takeoff gross weight capability for a given field length. Range loss of the DC- 9 Refan airplane for long range cruise was determined. The Refan airplane demonstrated stall, static longitudinal stability, longitudinal control, longitudinal trim, minimum control speeds, and directional control characteristics similar to the DC- 9 - 30 production airplane and complied with airworthiness requirements. Cruise, climb, and thrust reverser performance were evaluated. Structural and dynamic ground test, flight test and analytical results substantiate Refan Program requirements that the nacelle, thrust reverser hardware, and the airplane structural modifications are flightworthy and certifiable and that the airplane meets flutter speed margins. Estimated unit cost of a DC- 9 Refan retrofit program is 1. 338 million in mid- 1975 dollars with about an equal split in cost between airframe and engine...|$|E
25|$|In January 1905, small {{advertisements}} {{were placed}} in the Automobile and Cycle Trade Journal offering <b>bare</b> Harley-Davidson <b>engines</b> to the do-it-yourself trade. By April, complete motorcycles were in production on a very limited basis. That year, the first Harley-Davidson dealer, Carl H. Lang of Chicago, sold three bikes from the five built in the Davidson backyard shed. Years later the original shed was taken to the Juneau Avenue factory where it would stand for many decades as a tribute to the Motor Company's humble origins until it was accidentally destroyed by contractors cleaning the factory yard in the early 1970s.|$|R
50|$|While Guy Ligier {{was able}} to lease the Megatron engines from the Arrows team, Arrows boss Jackie Oliver only {{supplied}} the French team with the <b>bare</b> minimum of <b>engines</b> while (somewhat understandably) keeping the best and majority for his own team. By the last race {{of the season in}} Australia, Ligier only had 7 engines to work with.|$|R
5000|$|The Isotta Fraschini 8A {{was a car}} {{manufactured}} by Isotta Fraschini, successor to the Tipo 8 model with a new 7.3 litre straight-eight engine to replace the 5.9 litre unit used in the previous model. This new engine could produce [...] This was the most powerful mass-produced straight-8 engine {{in the world at}} that time. The Tipo 8A was offered only with <b>bare</b> chassis and <b>engine</b> for the coachbuilders.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new engine weight surrogate model and High Pressure Compressor (HPC) polytropic efficiency correction for the propulsion module in the Transport Aircraft OPTtimization (TASOPT) code. The goal of this work is to improve the accuracy and applicability of TASOPT in conceptual design of advanced technology, high bypass ratio, small-core, geared and direct-drive turbofan engines. The engine weight surrogate model was built as separate engine component weight surrogate models using least squares and Gaussian Process regression techniques on data data generated from NPSS/WATE++ and then combined to estimate a "bare" engine weight-including only the fan, compressor, turbine, and combustor-and a total engine weight, which also includes the nacelle, nozzle, and pylon. The new model estimates <b>bare</b> <b>engine</b> weight within +/- 10 % of published values for seven existing engines, and improves TASOPT's accuracy in predicting the geometry, weight, and performance of the Boeing 737 - 800. The effects of existing TASOPT engine weight models on optimization od D 8 -series aircraft concepts are also discussed. The HPC polytropic efficiency correction correlation, which reduces user-input HPC polytropic efficiency based on compressor exit corrected mass flow, was implemented based on data from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). When applied to TASOPT optimization studies of three D 8 -series aircraft, the efficiency correction drives the optimizer to increase engine core size. by Giulia Bissinger Pantalone. Thesis: S.

2500|$|Although the Griffon was {{designed}} for naval aircraft, on 8 November 1939 N E Rowe of the Air Ministry suggested fitting the Griffon in a Spitfire. Three weeks later permission was given to Supermarine to explore the possibilities of adapting the Griffon to the Spitfire; in response Supermarine issued 'Specification 466' on 4 December. This decision led {{to a change in}} the disposition of the engine accessories to reduce the frontal area of the engine as much as possible. As a result the frontal area of the <b>bare</b> Griffon <b>engine</b> was [...] compared with [...] of the Merlin, despite the Griffon's much larger capacity. This redesigned engine first ran on 26 June 1940 and went into production as the Griffon II.|$|R
5000|$|The M and T {{unitized}} engine formats added secondary designator suffixes, which {{especially for}} the 801 radial (and perhaps others), did not always match the letter suffix that designated the <b>bare</b> radial <b>engine</b> used for a particular unitized installation, confusing the naming of the 801 engine series' subtypes considerably. These suffix designators initially referred to these complete kits and their [...] "bare" [...] engine counterparts almost interchangeably. The A, B and L models were known (logically) as Motoranlage style MA, MB and ML engines in this form, but the common D-2 was instead known as the MG. As the war wore on the confusion increased, the E model was delivered as the Triebwerksanlage style TG or TH, seemingly suggesting a relation to the G and H engines, but in fact those were delivered as the TL and TP. It is rather common to see the turbocharged versions referred to only with the T for the more completely unitized Triebwerksanlage installations, notably the (most notoriously of all) TJ for the BMW 801J turbocharged radial subtype, and the TQ models, further confusing the issue.|$|R
40|$|A {{solution}} was generated {{for the physical}} properties of the Shuttle RCS 4000 N (900 lb) rocket engine exhaust plume flowfield. The modeled exhaust gas consists of the five most abundant molecular species, H 2, N 2, H 2 O, CO, and CO 2. The solution is for a <b>bare</b> RCS <b>engine</b> firing into a vacuum; the only additional hardware surface in the flowfield is a cylinder (=engine mount) which coincides with the nozzle lip outer corner at X = 0, extends to the flowfield outer boundary at X = - 137 m and is coaxial with the negative symmetry axis. Continuum gas dynamic methods and the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method were combined in an iterative procedure to produce a selfconsistent solution. Continuum methods {{were used in the}} RCS nozzle and in the plume as far as the P = 0. 03 breakdown contour; the DSMC method was used downstream of this continuum flow boundary. The DSMC flowfield extends beyond 100 m from the nozzle exit and thus the solution includes the farfield flow properties, but substantial information is developed on lip flow dynamics and thus results are also presented for the flow properties {{in the vicinity of the}} nozzle lip...|$|R
50|$|The Isotta Fraschini Tipo 8 is an {{automobile}} introduced in 1919 by Isotta Fraschini, a company which underwent a complete change after World War I. Until that time building {{a wide variety}} of models, the company adopted a single-series policy. Like many high end vehicles of the day, the car came from Isotta Fraschini as a chassis only. Bodies were typically from Italy’s top-tier coachbuilders, Carrozzeria Castagna and Cesare Sala, but other European and American coachbuilding firms lent their hands to the task of supplying bodies. It was the first serial produced car in the world to be equipped with a straight-8 engine. With this car the company gained great name and success as luxury car manufacturer. The main rival of the car was Rolls-Royce. The Tipo 8 was offered only with <b>bare</b> chassis and <b>engine</b> for the coachbuilders.|$|R
5000|$|From the late-1960s, BEA's {{aircraft}} {{began to}} appear in the [...] "Speedjack" [...] livery. This was the airline's final livery. Like the previous red, black and white livery, it was uniformly applied to its entire fleet. It consisted of a dark-blue cheatline across the cabin windows {{on each side of the}} fuselage, extending in a straight line from the flightdeck windows to the tail cone/tail engine exhaust/auxiliary power unit exhaust. The upper part of the fuselage (above the dark-blue cheatline) was all-white while its lower part (below the dark-blue cheatline) was light-grey. Unlike the earlier predominantly bare metal/white tail, liveries worn by BEA aircraft, the new livery featured a dark-blue tail with a prominent display of part of the Union flag in the shape of an arrow that symbolised an aircraft (composed of a fuselage with swept wings) on each side. The arrow-shaped part of the Union flag symbolising an aircraft became known as the [...] "Speedjack" [...] motif. Tridents wearing this livery also displayed the type's name (Trident for Trident 1C/1E, Trident Two for Trident 2E and Trident Three for Trident 3B) in white letters each side of the dark-blue centre engine while One-Eleven 500s wearing it displayed the type's name (Super one-eleven) in white letters on a dark-blue horizontal strip on each of their <b>bare</b> metal <b>engines.</b> This livery furthermore differed from its two immediate predecessors by only having the tip of the nose cone painted black (matte finish). All aircraft wearing this livery also featured the three-letter abbreviation of the airline's name in upper case white framed with a red border to emphasise the shape of the letters, which appeared above the dark-blue cheatline near the passenger/forward service doors each side of the white upper fuselage. In the case of regional feeder aircraft, the three-letter abbreviation of the airline's name was followed by the respective operating division's name in lower case dark-blue letters (e.g. scottish airways). The only aspect of the previous livery that was retained for all mainline aircraft were the red wings (both upper and undersides), with the aircraft registration in bold, white capital letters on each wing's underside. Following the merger with BOAC, many former BEA aircraft retained their basic [...] "Speedjack" [...] livery with just the name changing from red-framed, white BEA to dark-blue British airways pending repainting in the red, white and blue 1970s and early-80s Negus & Negus livery of British Airways.|$|R
40|$|Although {{criminal}} law {{can be justified}} with respect to nonutilitarian goals such as retribution, no one can deny that one way to justify {{criminal law}} is {{with respect to the}} instrumental ends of deterrence. So, one question of interest to scholars in the field has been how to think about the kinds of criminal law policy that encourage compliance. My own work has focused on this important question. Specifically, I have been concerned with the ways in which different kinds of criminal proscriptions, along with certain methods of law enforcement, could affect crime rates in disadvantaged, urban neighborhoods. In undertaking such analyses, I have emphasized classical sociological theory and social psychology, often for the purpose of criticizing economic approaches to crime control, which have been interpreted to emphasize higher levels of severe punishments for conduct such as drug offenses. Thus, as a student of criminology and psychology, and a sometime critic of economic approaches to criminal law policy, I initially imagined that this commentary would be a sharp critique of Eric Posner 2 ̆ 7 s Law and Social Norms as it applies to topics I have mined in past work. In his book, Posner attempts to boil down a wide variety of human actions to their <b>bare</b> essentials. The <b>engine</b> of the book is a general model of nonlegal cooperation, which Posner describes as a signaling game. Because people desire to cooperate with one another, they engage in regular but costly sorts of behaviors in order to communicate to each other that they are good partners for cooperation. Posner calls these behavioral regularities 2 ̆ 2 norms, 2 ̆ 2 and he uses this general model to comment on everything from family law to voting to criminal law. Thus, Posner explains that observance of criminal law—which could be costly to compliant individuals—is a function of the fact that people 2 ̆ 2 are likely to obtain future returns when others see them obeying a legitimate law. 2 ̆...|$|R
