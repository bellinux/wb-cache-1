This study addressed the very limited understanding of the distribution, diversity and substrate specificity of such bacteria from 13 soil samples, varying in levels of HCH contamination, from four sites in Spain. Hexachlorocyclohexane removal occurred in 16 of 36 enrichment cultures. Hexachlorocyclohexane-degrading populations were clearly associated with HCH-contaminated soils, and populations growing on the delta-HCH isomer were only found in soil contaminated with delta-HCH. <b>beta-Hexachlorocyclohexane</b> was persistent in enrichment cultures, {{and there was no}} evidence for populations growing on beta-HCH.

We examined the relation between serum levels of the pesticides heptachlor epoxide (HCE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and <b>beta-hexachlorocyclohexane</b> (beta-HCCH) in pregnant women, and the occurrence of cryptorchidism in their sons. These three pesticides were previously suggested as risk factors for cryptorchidism. In a nested case-control design, we compared serum levels between mothers of cases (n = 219) and controls (n =: 564), selected from the Collaborative Perinatal Project, a US birth cohort study of pregnancies in 1959 - 1966. The offspring of mothers with HCE levels above the 90 th percentile compared to those below the 10 th percentile had an adjusted odds ratio of cryptorchidisin of 1. 2 (95 % confidence interval 0. 6 - 2. 6); for beta-HCCH the odds ratio was 1. 6 (0. 7 - 3. 6).

40|$|Because of its {{persistence}} and toxicological profile, <b>beta-hexachlorocyclohexane</b> (beta-HCH) {{has been proposed}} {{for inclusion in the}} Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Although the use of technical HCH, which is the primary source of beta-HCH in the environment, has been banned in the EU in 1978 and progressively at a global level, beta-HCH is still detectable in the general environment worldwide. Human exposure mostly occurs via food and may be of concern in areas where illegal use and/or improper disposal of stockpiles occurred and locally grown food is consumed. Exposure of the Italian general population to beta-HCH has been poorly characterised. Lack of human biomonitoring data severely hinders the ability to interpret potential increases in exposure related to situations of environmental risk. We carried out a human biomonitoring study aimed to provide baseline information on background exposure of the Italian general population to this pollutant. For this purpose, we analysed 116 serum samples from groups of subjects of both sex from the general population residing in three Italian towns at different latitudes.

40|$|In May 2005, <b>beta-hexachlorocyclohexane</b> (β-HCH) {{was found}} in a sample of bovine bulk milk from a farm in the Sacco River valley (Latium region, central Italy). The primary source of {{contamination}} was suspected to be industrial discharge into the environment with the Sacco River as the main mean of dispersion. Since then, a surveillance programme on bulk milk of the local farms was carried out by the veterinary services. In order to estimate the spatial probability of β- HCH contamination of milk produced in the Sacco River valley and draw probability maps of contamination, probability maps of β-HCH values in milk were estimated by indicator kriging (IK), a geo-statistical estimator, and traditional logistic regression (LR) combined with a geographical information systems approach. The former technique produces a spatial view of probabilities above a specific threshold at non-sampled locations on the basis of observed values in the area, while LR gives the probabilities in specific locations on the basis of certain environmental predictors, namely the distance from the river, the distance from the pollution site, the elevation above the river level and the intrinsic vulnerability of hydro-geological formations. Based on the β-HCH data from 2005 in the Sacco River valley, the two techniques resulted in similar maps of high risk of milk contamination.

Supercritical fluid extraction followed by gas chromatography was conducted on adipose surgical specimens to determine OC concentrations. The mean follow-up time from surgery was 3. 6 years. Thirty women (13. 4 %) were diagnosed with a recurrence. The concentration of pesticides and PCBs was correlated with baseline age and body mass index, but not with cancer stage.

The risk for the highest tertile of the PCB congener Ballschmiter and Zell 118 was 4. 0 (95 % CI, 1. 3 - 4. 9).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{measure the}} impact of {{occupational}} and lifestyle factors on concentrations of organochlorine compounds in a general population sample living near an electrochemical factory with a high airborne concentration of hexachlorobenzene (HCB). METHODS: Serum samples from 608 people (328 selected from a random sample) were collected in 1994. Information on lifestyles, occupation, and medical condition was obtained by questionnaire. RESULTS: HCB and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were detected in all samples (means 36. 7 ng/ml and 4. 3 ng/ml respectively), followed by dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethane (DDE) and <b>beta-hexachlorocyclohexane</b> (beta-HCH), found in 98. 7 % and 87. 3 % of the samples respectively (means 4. 6 ng/ml and 2. 5 ng/ml, respectively). Concentrations of HCB were the highest ever reported. Occupation in the factory was the main determinant {{of the variation in}} concentrations of HCB (regression coefficients 1. 52 (SEM 0. 14) in 1 n (HCB) for workers in the production department, and 2. 13 (0. 23) for workers in maintenance department) and explained the highest concentrations of HCB found in men of middle age. In retired workers, concentrations of HCB declined with time since retirement. The PCBs, dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), and beta-HCH were independent of the occupation and concentrations were similar to those found in other populations. Concentrations of beta-HCH and DDE in the whole population, and HCB among non-workers, were higher in women than in men. Concentrations of all measured organochlorine compounds increased with age and body mass index. Consumption of locally caught fish was an independent determinant of HCB and PCB concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This population incorporated HCB directly through occupation in the electrochemical factory, by airborne pollution, and consumption of locally caught fish. Concentrations of other common organochlorine compounds were not higher than expected.

40|$|In view of {{the large}} {{differences}} between the concentrations of estrogenic chemicals needed to elicit effects in in vitro assays and their levels in human tissues, {{it is hard to}} explain possible health risks in terms of exposure to individual compounds. Human populations, however, are exposed to mixtures of estrogenic and estrogen-like agents and it is necessary to consider the impact of combined effects. We assessed the combined effects of 1 -(o-chlorophenyl) - 1 -(p-chlorophenyl) - 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethane (o,p'-DDT), 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), <b>beta-hexachlorocyclohexane</b> (beta-HCH), and 1, 1 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) - 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethane (p,p'-DDT) on the induction of cell proliferation in MCF- 7 cells. All four compounds are persistent organochlorines that can be found in human tissues. We performed extensive concentration-response analyses with the single agents to predict the effects of two mixtures of all four compounds with different mixture ratios. We calculated the predictions by using the pharmacologically well-founded models of concentration addition and independent action and then tested them experimentally. o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, beta-HCH, and p,p'-DDT acted together to produce proliferative effects in MCF- 7 cells. The combined effect of the four agents could be predicted on the basis of data about single agent concentration-response relationships. Regression analysis demonstrated that there were combination effects even when each mixture component was present at levels at or below its individual no-observed-effect-concentration. We assessed combination effects in two ways: First, evaluations in relation to the proliferative responses induced by single mixture components revealed that the combination effects were stronger than the effects of the most potent constituent. Thus, according to this method of evaluation, the combined effects may be termed synergistic. Second, comparisons with the expected effects, as predicted by concentration addition and independent action, showed excellent agreement between prediction and observation. With this approach, the combined effect of all four compounds can be termed additive...|$|E
40|$|Background & objectives: Preterm birth (PTB) is an {{important}} cause of prenatal death, neonatal morbidity and mortality and adult illness. Increased inflammation occurs in normal parturition, and inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress {{are found to be}} higher in PTB cases. The present study was planned to investigate the association of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) with mRNA expression of inflammatory pathway genes such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) in preterm delivery (PTD) cases. Methods: Maternal blood samples of PTD (n= 30) cases and equal number of term delivery (n= 30) were collected at the time of labour. Women occupationally exposed to OCPs and other high risk factors such as anaemia, hypertension, bacterial vaginosis, renal and heart disease, diabetes, etc. were excluded. The OCP levels were estimated by gas chromatography, and mRNA expressions of TNF-α and COX- 2 genes were analysed using real-time PCR (qPCR). Results: Significantly higher levels of β-HCH (<b>beta-hexachlorocyclohexane,</b> 95 % CI= 2. 08 - 4. 633, p 0 = 0. 001), p′p′-DDE (para, para-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, 95 % CI= 0. 546 - 2. 551, p 0 = 0. 003), and o′p′-DDD (ortho, para-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, 95 % CI= 0. 004 - 0. 690, P= 0. 047) were observed in maternal blood of PTB cases as compared to term delivery. The mRNA expressions of COX- 2 and TNF-α genes were 3. 13 and 2. 31 folds higher in PTB cases in comparison to term delivery. l 0 inear positive correlations were observed between period of gestation (POG) and ΔCt of COX- 2 and TNF-α genes. Interpretation & conclusions: Environmental factors such as OCPs may be associated with inflammatory events showing gene-environment interaction in PTB cases. Evaluating the molecular control of inflammation along with gene environment interaction may be used as a model to explore the aetiology of idiopathic PTB cases and may be considered for the prognosis of adverse reproductive outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Urine and plasma {{have been}} used to date for the {{biomonitoring}} of exposure to pollutants and are still the preferred fluids for this purpose; however, these fluids mainly provide information on the short term and may present a high level of variability regarding pesticide concentrations, especially for nonpersistent compounds. Hair analysis may provide information about chronic exposure that is averaged over several months; therefore, this method has been proposed as an alternative to solely relying on these fluids. Although the possibility of detecting pesticides in hair has been demonstrated over the past few years, the unknown linkage between exposure and pesticides concentration in hair has limited the recognition of this matrix as a relevant tool for assessing human exposure. Based on a rat model in which there was controlled exposure to a mixture of pesticides composed of lindane, <b>beta-hexachlorocyclohexane,</b> beta-endosulfan, p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, dieldrin, pentachlorophenol, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, cyhalothrin, permethrin, cypermethrin, propiconazole, fipronil, oxadiazon, diflufenican, trifluralin, carbo-furan, and propoxur, the current work demonstrates the association between exposure intensity and resulting pesticide concentration in hair. We also compared the results obtained from a hair analysis to urine and plasma collected from the same rats. Hair, blood, and urine were collected from rats submitted to 90 -day exposure by gavage to the aforementioned mixture of common pesticides at different levels. We observed a linear relationship between exposure intensity and the concentration of pesticides in the rats' hair (R-Pearson 0. 453 - 0. 978, p < 0. 01). A comparison with results from urine and plasma samples demonstrated the relevance of hair analysis and, for many chemicals, its superiority over using fluids for differentiating animals from different groups and for re-attributing animals to their correct groups of exposure based on pesticide concentrations in the matrix. Therefore, this study strongly supports hair analysis as a reliable tool to be used during epidemiological studies to investigate exposure-associated adverse health effects...|$|E

Un 96, 5 % de los individuos presentaban valores detectables de HCB (media: 78, 56 ng/g lípido); el 90, 4 % β-HCH (media: 42, 78 ng/g lípido) y un 3, 5 % γ-HCH. No se detectó heptacloro epóxido ni beta-endosulfán. En el modelo de regresión, el incremento de la edad aumentaba los valores de todos los plaguicidas (p Objective: To {{identify and}} analyze levels of seven organochlorine pesticides [hexachlorobenzene (HCB), <b>beta-hexachlorocyclohexane</b> (β-HCH), gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH), heptachlor epoxide, beta-endosulfan, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p´-DDE) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p´-DDT) ] in the serum of adults of four areas of Biscay (Spain) {{not exposed to}} known sources of pesticides. Method: We analyzed 283 individual samples from volunteers recruited from the census. The volunteers were interviewed using a questionnaire with items on demographic variables and consumption. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test for discrete variables and analysis of variance and multiple linear regression models for continuous variables. Results: We detected p,p´-DDE in 100 % of the volunteers (mean: 191. 43 ng/g lipid), while 31 % had detectable levels of p,p´-DDT (mean: 18. 9 ng/g lipid). Detectable levels of HCB were found in 96. 5 % of the volunteers (mean: 78. 56 ng/g lipid), β-HCH in 90. 4 % (mean: 42. 78 ng/g lipid) and γ-HCH in 3. 5 %. Heptachlor epoxide and beta-endosulfan were not detected. In the regression model higher levels of all pesticides were found with increasing age (p< 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences}} by area of residence, except for HCB and p,p´-DDE. Women had significantly higher levels of HCB and β-HCH (p< 0. 001). Body mass index showed a significant positive gradient in HCB and β-HCH (p< 0. 05). There was no association between pesticides and other variables, breast feeding, occupation or social class. Conclusions: These results indicate that the general adult population of Biscay has been and is exposed to organochlorine pesticides. However, their levels are within the range observed by other authors...|$|E

Some {{chemicals}} {{released into}} the environment, including mercury and some organochlorine compounds (OCs), are suspected to have a key role on subclinical brain dysfunction in childhood. Alteration of the glutamatergic system may be one mechanistic pathway. We aimed to determine whether mercury and seven OCs, including PCBs 138, 153, and 180, DDT and DDE, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and <b>beta-hexachlorocyclohexane</b> (β-HCH) influence the cord levels of two excitatory amino acids, glutamate and aspartate. Second, we evaluated if this association was mediated by glutamate uptake measured in human placental membranes. The study sample included 40 newborns from a Spanish cohort selected according to cord mercury levels. We determined the content of both amino acids in cord blood samples by means of HPLC and assessed their associations with the contaminants using linear regression analyses, {{and the effect of}} the contaminants on glutamate uptake by means of [3 H]-aspartate binding in human placenta samples. PCB 138, β-HCH, and the sum of the three PCBs and seven OCs showed a significant negative association with glutamate levels (decrease of 51, 24, 56 and 54 %, respectively, in glutamate levels for each 10 -fold increase in the contaminant concentration). Mercury did not show a significant correlation neither with glutamate nor aspartate levels in cord blood, however a compensatory effect between T-Hg and both PCB 138, and 4, 4 '-DDE was observed. The organo-metallic derivative methylmercury completely inhibited glutamate uptake in placenta while PCB 138 and β-HCH partially inhibited it (IC 50 values: 4. 9 ± 0. 8 μM, 14. 2 ± 1. 2 nM and 6. 9 ± 2. 9 nM, respectively). We conclude that some environmental toxicants may alter the glutamate content in the umbilical cord blood, which might underlie alterations in human development. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.
