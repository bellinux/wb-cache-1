30|$|It can be assumed, {{without loss}} of generality, that the GOP {{structure}} is IPPP..., where I is an intra-coded picture and P is a forward-predicted picture. The adaptive rate control scheme in the H. 264 /AVC {{is composed of}} two layers: the GOP layer rate control and the frame layer rate control. An additional <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> layer rate control is added if {{the size of the}} <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> is smaller than a frame. It was noted in [4] that using a bigger <b>basic</b> <b>unit,</b> a higher PSNR can be achieved with higher bit fluctuations, and using a smaller <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> there will be smaller bit fluctuations with a slight loss in PSNR. Since we want to maximize PSNR for this study, the <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> is selected as a frame so {{there is no need for}} an additional <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> layer rate control. In addition, only the frame layer rate control is modified; the operation of the GOP layer rate control remains the same.|$|R
5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, the J-Man of Just Games Retro said {{the game is}} overly slow, as the player must produce a few basic buildings and peasants in order to gather resources, and then start building combat units, while the enemy starts with more buildings {{and the ability to}} immediately send out offensive units to undo the player's efforts. He also criticized that the <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> of the two sides are essentially identical and that the interface is clunky, but praised the resource system and effective enemy AI.|$|E

25|$|The Telugu {{script is}} an abugida {{consisting}} of 60 symbols – 16 vowels, 3 vowel modifiers, and 41 consonants. Telugu has {{a complete set}} of letters that follow a system to express sounds. The script is derived from the Brahmi Script like those of many other Indian languages. The Telugu script is written from left to right and consists of sequences of simple and/or complex characters. The script is syllabic in nature—the <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> of writing are syllables. Since the number of possible syllables is very large, syllables are composed of more <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> such as vowels (“accu” or “swaram”) and consonants (“hallu” or “vyanjanam”). Consonants in consonant clusters take shapes that are very different from the shapes they take elsewhere. Consonants are presumed pure consonants, that is, without any vowel sound in them. However, it is traditional to write and read consonants with an implied 'a' vowel sound. When consonants combine with other vowel signs, the vowel part is indicated orthographically using signs known as vowel “mātras”. The shapes of vowel “mātras” are also very different from the shapes of the corresponding vowels.|$|E
25|$|Afghanistan's {{resistance}} movement originated in chaos and, at first, regional warlords waged {{virtually all of}} its fighting locally. As warfare became more sophisticated, outside support and regional coordination grew. The <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> of mujahideen organization and action continued to reflect the highly decentralized nature of Afghan society and strong loci of competing mujahideen and tribal groups, particularly in isolated areas among the mountains. Eventually, the seven main mujahideen parties allied as the political bloc called Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{linguistics}} {{emerged as}} a reaction to generativist theory in the 1970s and 1980s. Led by theorists like Ronald Langacker and George Lakoff, cognitive linguists propose that language is an emergent property of basic, general-purpose cognitive processes. In contrast to the generativist school of linguistics, cognitive linguistics is non-modularist and functionalist in character. Important developments in cognitive linguistics include cognitive grammar, frame semantics, and conceptual metaphor, all of which are {{based on the idea that}} form–function correspondences based on representations derived from embodied experience constitute the <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> of language.|$|E

25|$|Road {{signs in}} the United Kingdom are governed by an {{extremely}} complex and detailed set of guidelines. The <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> of measurement used by sign designers are the 'x-height' (the height of the lower case letter 'x') and the 'stroke width' (sw) (4 sw = 1 x-height). The sizes of borders, symbols and arrows and the spacing and layout of the sign face are expressed in sw, {{so that all the}} elements remain in proportion. The x-height of a sign is dictated mainly by the speed of traffic approaching it, hence 300mm x-heights are common on motorways, whereas parking signs are mostly at 15mm or 20mm x-height.|$|E
25|$|The Restoration {{was also}} the time when John Locke wrote many of his {{philosophical}} works. Locke's empiricism was an attempt at understanding the basis of human understanding itself and thereby devising a proper manner for making sound decisions. These same scientific methods led Locke to his Two Treatises of Government, which later inspired the thinkers in the American Revolution. As with his work on understanding, Locke moves from the most <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> of society toward the more elaborate, and, like Thomas Hobbes, he emphasises the plastic nature of the social contract. For an age that had seen absolute monarchy overthrown, democracy attempted, democracy corrupted, and limited monarchy restored; only a flexible basis for government could be satisfying.|$|E
25|$|In {{multiplayer}} gameplay {{the player}} may {{choose one of}} four roles in battle: infantry, air, support, or armor. The infantry role gives access to various infantry squads such as anti-tank teams, snipers, and light transport vehicles whereas armor allows players to use various classes of tanks, the dominant direct fire land combat unit of the game. Players choosing the air role have access to anti-armor, air superiority, scout and transport helicopters. Finally, the support role contains anti-air, artillery, and repair units. Each role's <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> can be purchased by everyone but are more expensive for players with a different role. In addition, each role has its own exclusive units that aren't available for purchase by other roles.|$|E

These were {{intended}} to include all the eligible men of the country, serving as a recruitment depot to provide men to the first and second lines of the army. Besides the role of recruitment depots, its units could occasionally be actively employed in the garrison of fortresses or in local defense roles. The Ordenanças continued to follow the organization established by King Sebastian, with their <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> being the companies of 250 men, grouped in captaincies. In the city of Lisbon, whose inhabitants were exempt from being draft for the auxiliary troops, the Ordenanças had a special organization, constituting five terços commanded by colonels.|$|E
25|$|The {{legislative}} assemblies were {{political institutions}} in the ancient Roman Kingdom. While one, the Curiate Assembly, had some legislative powers, these involved {{nothing more than a}} right to symbolically ratify decrees issued by the Roman King. The functions of the other, the Calate Assembly ("Comitia Calata"), were purely religious. During the years of the kingdom, all of the People of Rome were divided among a total of thirty curiae, the <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> of division in the two popular assemblies. The members in each curia would vote, and the majority therein would determine how that curia voted before the assembly. Thus a majority of the curiae (at least sixteen of the thirty) was needed during any vote in either the Curiate Assembly or the Calate Assembly.|$|E
25|$|The missing {{information}} needed to help explain how new features could pass from a parent to its offspring {{was provided by the}} pioneering genetics work of Gregor Mendel. Mendel’s experiments with several generations of pea plants demonstrated that inheritance works by separating and reshuffling hereditary information during the formation of sex cells and recombining that information during fertilisation. This is like mixing different hands of playing cards, with an organism getting a random mix of half of the cards from one parent, and half of the cards from the other. Mendel called the information factors; however, they later became known as genes. Genes are the <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> of heredity in living organisms. They contain the information that directs the physical development and behavior of organisms.|$|E

25|$|Genes are {{commonly}} {{regarded as the}} <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> transferred through an HGT event. However {{it is also possible}} for HGT to occur within genes. For example, {{it has been shown that}} horizontal transfer between closely related species results in more exchange of ORF fragments, a type a transfer called gene conversion, mediated by homologous recombination. The analysis of a group of four Escherichia coli and two Shigella flexneri strains revealed that the sequence stretches common to all six strains contain polymorphic sites, consequences of homologous recombination. Clusters of excess of polymorphic sites can thus be used to detect tracks of DNA recombined with a distant relative. This method of detection is, however, restricted to the sites in common to all analysed sequences, limiting the analysis to a group of closely related organisms.|$|E

These measurements are recorded on a length of a bamboo, which will serves as a kind of yardstick to create the layout of the house compound. The <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> are a depa (fathom), hasta (cubit), and musti (shaftment). Other variation are depa media (vertical version of depa), sedemak (hand), tampak (width of closed fist, with thumb hid) and lengkat (width between a tip of a thumb and the tip of the forefinger if stretched). Kaja-kangin concept is also used in construction. The first post to be erected in a pavilion is always the one at the kaja-kangin corner. An offering platform is attached {{near the top of the}} kaja-kangin post. After the erection of this post, the rest of the posts are erected following clockwise direction. This clockwise principle of erecting posts is a principle repeated all over Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|The breast is an {{apocrine gland}} that {{produces}} the milk used to feed an infant. The nipple of the breast is surrounded by the areola (nipple-areola complex). The areola has many sebaceous glands, and the skin color varies from pink to dark brown. The <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> of the breast are the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a mammary gland. They are distributed throughout {{the body of the}} breast. Approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30mm of the base of the nipple. The terminal lactiferous ducts drain the milk from TDLUs into 4–18 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple. The milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a lactating woman, and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast is also composed of connective tissues (collagen, elastin), white fat, and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. Sensation in the breast is provided by the peripheral nervous system innervation by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth intercostal nerves. The T-4 nerve (Thoracic spinal nerve 4), which innervates the dermatomic area, supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.|$|E
