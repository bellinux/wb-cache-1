5|$|The overall {{structure}} of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a <b>belt</b> <b>of</b> mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>of</b> mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets. Since {{the discovery of the}} Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.|$|E
5|$|By 09:00 hours, the II SS Panzer Corps {{had broken}} through the Soviet first <b>belt</b> <b>of</b> defence along its entire front. While probing {{positions}} {{between the first}} and second Soviet defensive belts, at 13:00, the 2nd SS Panzer Division's vanguard came under fire from two T-34 tanks, which were destroyed. Forty more Soviet tanks soon engaged the division. The 1st Guards Tank Army clashed with the 2nd SS Panzer Division in a four-hour battle, resulting in the Soviet tanks withdrawing. However, the battle had bought enough time for units of the 23rd Soviet Guards Rifle Corps, lodged in the Soviet second belt, to prepare itself and be reinforced with additional anti-tank guns. By the early evening, 2nd SS Panzer Division had reached the minefields that marked the outer perimeter of the Soviet second <b>belt</b> <b>of</b> defence. The 1st SS Division had secured Bykovka by 16:10. It then pushed forward towards the second <b>belt</b> <b>of</b> defence at Yakovlevo, but its attempts to break through were rebuffed. By the end of the day, the 1st SS Division had sustained 97 dead, 522 wounded, and 17 missing and lost about 30 tanks. Together with the 2nd SS Panzer Division, it had forced a wedge far into the defences of the 6th Guards Army.|$|E

5|$|Debra's origins {{were from}} an area of {{convection}} over the western Bahamas and Florida related to an upper-tropospheric cold-core low and a tropical wave on July15. Whilst {{under the influence of}} a subtropical ridge–or a <b>belt</b> <b>of</b> high pressure–it slowly meandered southwestward and arrived into the Gulf of Mexico on July20. A weak surface circulation was observed near 1900EST (0100UTC on July21) which was affected by an inverted trough as they turned westward. The system's circulation remained indistinct until July23 as winds of 22–30knots consorted with squalls adjacent to the coasts of Louisiana and Texas.|$|E

5|$|Dynamical {{friction}} from {{a massive}} <b>belt</b> <b>of</b> planetesimals could also enable Planet Nine's capture {{in a stable}} orbit. Recent models propose that a 60–130 Earth mass disk of planetesimals could have formed via streaming instabilities following the photoevaporation of the outer parts of the gas disk. If the disk had a distant inner edge, 100–200 AU, a planet encountering Neptune would have a 20% chance of being captured in an orbit similar to that proposed for Planet Nine. The observed clustering is more likely if the inner edge is at 200 AU. Unlike the gas nebula the planetesimal disk {{is likely to be}} long lived, potentially allowing a later capture.|$|E

The intrusions are thought to be subvolcanic bodies associated with a volcanic front that was active in the Miocene, during early stages of subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate. With the notable exception of King Island, all the intrusive and eruptive rocks are calc-alkaline, mainly granodioritic bodies and dacite ejecta.|$|E
