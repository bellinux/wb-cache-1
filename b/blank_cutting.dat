The {{aim is to}} increase the efficiency of the <b>blank</b> <b>cutting</b> operation into the plates by means of rational applying lubricant-coolant, stabilization of the cutting edge in slitting wheels and combined machining of the plates. The relations for design of the plate deflection for determination of te height parameters of plates cutted by a stabilized wheel and thickness of the disturbed layer after combined machining have been obtained firstly by an analytical way. The rational conditions of cutting blanks of the non-metallic materials into the plates have been determined; the role of technological inheritance in the defects of cutted plates by the finished bases has been revealed; the new process for stabilization of the slitted wheels has been developed. The technological recommendations and device for tension degree check of AKVR wheels have been introduced in 1993 in the leading enterprise (Production Enterprise "Itil"). The efficiency is expressed in the increase of cutting productivity (1, 5 - 2 times) at keeping yield of the finished plates and in the prevention of rejection caused by AKVR breakdown at their tension.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} {{complexity of the}} component geometry and characteristics {{as well as the}} demand of energy efficiency and resource-saving production, sheet fabricating industry is faced with a challenging task. In this context tool related technologies like high speed impact cutting are interesting, because of there benefits in reducibility, component quality and resource-saving production compared to conventional cutting technologies. The kinetic energy of the tooling will be nearly completely dissipate into cutting energy and is not getting lost in heat energy. This cutting procedure effects shear bands, which causes fatigue of the material. The understanding of this process is based on the detailed knowledge about the material properties under high forming-velocity and high temperatures. Depending on the used material plastic deformation, hardening, softening, localization, fracture and high increase of temperature can be detected at the same time. Object of the current research is the determining of technological parameters and criterias for the evaluation of cutting-surface of the high speed impact cutting. With the help of the reference technologies (conventional) <b>cutting</b> and fine <b>blanking</b> <b>cutting</b> tests are made by measuring of cutting force and cutting speed. Interrelations between cutting force, velocity, energy, die-clearance, sheet thickness, mechanical material and the structure of material properties are analyzed.

Furthermore the evaluation of the cutting quality provides a basis to find equivalent criterias for evaluating the cutting-quality achieved with high speed impact cutting...|$|R

One {{of the reasons is}} the fact that they rarely include the modeling of internal damage of material. This is a decisive feature {{in order to be able}} to predict defective parts in processes like forging or to describe processes in which fracture is a part of the process itself as in sheet <b>blanking</b> or metal <b>cutting.</b> In large deformation of metals, when plastic deformation reaches a threshold level, which may depend on the loading, the fatigue limit and the ultimate stress, a ductile damage process may occur concomitantly with the plastic deformation due to the nucleation, growth and coalescence of micro-voids. Although damage and plastic deformation are two distinct dissipative processes, they influence each other. In this paper a numerical benchmark of the uniaxial tensile tests, for aluminium alloy, has been performed using LS-Dyna and Deform 2 D without damage.

40|$|Abstract. Forming {{tools for}} a press are usually {{machined}} with {{computer numerical control}} (CNC) machine tools. This could be quite time consuming—calculating tool tracks, selecting <b>cutting</b> tools, <b>cutting</b> <b>blanks,</b> design fixation and finally machining—especially for a small batch of parts. One alternative method is to cut a die and draw punch tools from a blank sheet and join the plates together. Clamping plates together is fast and easy to implement by using, for example, threaded rods and guide bars with a certain tolerance to ensure alignment. A laser, a waterjet or a plasma cutter {{can be used for}} cutting plates. The laser and the fine beam plasma cutting in particular are precise methods that give a fine surface quality even without a need for fine-tuning [4]. The method saves material compared with machining because a die and a punch could be cut at the same time from a blank sheet as a compatible pair; in addition, the required number of plates could be estimated depending of the length of a pressed product. The University of Oulu, Oulu Southern Institute and the Future Manufacturing Technology group has manufactured several forming tools within this technique and found it suitable for easily experimenting with different solutions and options. Furthermore, the method is likely to help especially small and medium enterprise (SMEs) in research and development phase by lowering production costs in an efficient way...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to present some {{technological}} problems with forming of the titanium implants and medical tools by the plastic working methods. Design/methodology/approach: Application of the new biomaterials such as titanium alloys needs to carry on tests on optimisation of the methods and parameters of the plastic working, therefore some experiments in order to determine the friction coefficient or analyse the influence of the cutting methods on the cut-surface appearance were done. Findings: As far as stamping is concerned, it was found that the proper lubrication not only decreases frictional resistance but also limits or even completely eliminates creation of the titanium “build-ups” on the tools. As far as cutting methods are concerned, the cut-surface significantly depends on the applied cutting method. Guillotining, laser and abrasive waterjet cutting were taken into consideration. Guillotining and laser cutting influence the titanium microstructure mostly. Abrasive waterjet cutting does not cause any changes in microstructure. Research limitations/implications: An application for the implants almost unworkable biomaterials, such as titanium alloys, needs overcoming many technological barriers such as proper selection of the lubricant, deformation temperature, strain velocity etc. Moreover, titanium belongs to the very expensive materials, so material costs are the main research limitation. Practical implications: The investigations of the friction coefficient or the influence of the cutting method on the cut-surface quality are important for producing both implants and surgical tools by such methods as: <b>cutting,</b> <b>blanking,</b> bending, stamping, etc. Originality/value: There are only a very few works on the sheet-metal forming processes of the titanium alloys, so each new information on the titanium deformation is valuable...|$|R

One of the critical measurements to determine the effectiveness of a numerical model is its capability of accurately predicting failure modes. To be able to make accurate predictions of deformation, tool force, blank design, etc computer simulation is almost necessary. In the automotive industry the tooling design can now be made by computer and analysed with FEA, and the amount of prototypes required for qualifying a design before manufacturing commences is greatly reduced. Tool design is a specialized phase of tool engineering. While there are many diecutting operation, some of which are very complex, they can all be reduce to plain <b>blanking,</b> piercing, lancing, <b>cutting</b> off and parting, notching, shaving and trimming. The cutting action that occurs in the piercing is quite {{similar to that of the}} chip formation ahead of a cutting tool. The punch contact the material supported by the die and a pressure builds up occurs, When the elastic limit of the work material is the exceeded the material begins to flow plastically (plastic deformation). It is often impractical to pierce holes while forming, or before forming because they would become distorted in the forming operation. The aim of the research is to develop techniques that would reduce the amount time spent during the tool qualifying stage. By accurately setting a finite element simulation that closely matches the experimental or real-life situation we can great understand the material behaviour and properties before tool designing phase commences. In this analysis, during the piercing process of the drainage hole for a shock absorber seat, there is visible material tearing (on the neck) which as a result the component is rejected. This results in material wastage, and prolonged cycle time since the operation has to be now done separately at a different workstation...|$|R
2500|$|Original master discs {{are created}} by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a {{modulated}} groove into a blank record. The <b>blank</b> records for <b>cutting</b> used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a [...] "metallic soap", containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut [...] "wax" [...] sound discs would {{be placed in a}} vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual [...] "plating" [...] of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, [...] "matrix" [...] or [...] "father". The [...] "father" [...] is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a [...] "mother". Many mothers can be grown on a single [...] "father" [...] before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The [...] "mothers" [...] are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as [...] "sons". Each [...] "mother" [...] {{can be used to make}} many [...] "sons" [...] before deteriorating. The [...] "sons" [...] are then converted into [...] "stampers" [...] by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the [...] "father"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a [...] "son" [...] (for each side), the [...] "father" [...] is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the [...] "two-step process" [...] (as it does not entail creation of [...] "sons" [...] but does involve creation of [...] "mothers", which are used for test playing and kept as [...] "safeties" [...] for electroforming future [...] "sons") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The [...] "sons" [...] made during a [...] "three-step" [...] electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than [...] "fathers".|$|R
