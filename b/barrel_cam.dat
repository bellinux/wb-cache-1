5000|$|The Ruger American Pistol is a polymer-framed, {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{introduced by}} Ruger in December 2015. The pistol uses a pre-tensioned striker firing system, and is chambered in 9mm Luger and [...]45 ACP. The pistol uses a Browning-type locked-breech short recoil action, with a <b>barrel</b> <b>cam</b> {{system that is}} designed to reduce felt recoil. The serialized part of the pistol is a steel chassis, which is fit to a glass-filled nylon frame. The frame incorporates a Picatinny rail for mounting accessories.|$|E
50|$|A face cam {{produces}} {{motion by}} using a follower riding {{on the face of}} a disk. The most common type has the follower ride in a slot so that the captive follower produces radial motion with positive positioning without the need for a spring or other mechanism to keep the follower in contact with the control surface. A face cam of this type generally has only one slot for a follower on each face. In some applications, a single element, such as a gear, a <b>barrel</b> <b>cam,</b> or other rotating element with a flat face, may do duty as a face cam in addition to other purposes.|$|E
50|$|The P226, {{like the}} other members of the SIG Classic family, {{operates}} by the locked breech short-recoil method pioneered by John Browning. On firing, the slide and barrel are locked together for a few millimetres of rearward movement, after which the <b>barrel</b> is <b>cammed</b> down at the rear. By this time the bullet has left the barrel and the pressure has dropped to safe levels, whereupon the slide completes the rearward stroke, ejecting the spent cartridge. The recoil spring then propels the slide forward, stripping a round from the magazine and in the last few millimetres of forward movement the <b>barrel</b> is <b>cammed</b> upwards, locking the slide and barrel together again.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} method of {{geometry}} modeling for indexing cam mechanism by using screw theory and exponential product formula. Kinematic analysis based on screw theory is introduced firstly. Then, method to model surface of indexing cams is presented when screw theory and exponential product formula are applied. The paper gives examples to obtain the geometry models of roller gear <b>cam,</b> <b>barrel</b> indexing <b>cam</b> and parallel indexing cam. Our work suggests that this method can avoid the burdensome work on building coordinate systems, transformation matrixes and understanding on the mechanism. Moreover, this method {{can be used to}} innovate and design new types of indexing mechanism...|$|R
50|$|The CZ 110 is a recoil-operated, locked-breech {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{that features}} a short-recoiling barrel that locks to the slide with a single massive lug which engages the ejection port cut-out when locked. To unlock, the <b>barrel</b> is <b>cammed</b> down by {{the interaction of the}} shaped <b>cam</b> on the <b>barrel</b> and the angular camming guide in the frame.|$|R
5000|$|A {{cylindrical}} cam or <b>barrel</b> <b>cam</b> is a cam {{in which the}} follower rides {{on the surface of}} a cylinder. In the most common type, the follower rides in a groove cut into the surface of a cylinder. These cams are principally used to convert rotational motion to linear motion parallel to the rotational axis of the cylinder. A cylinder may have several grooves cut into the surface and drive several followers. Cylindrical cams can provide motions that involve more than a single rotation of the cylinder and generally provide positive positioning, removing the need for a spring or other provision to keep the follower in contact with the control surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{reciprocating}} action may be produced several ways. A crank or Scotch yoke type drive may be used, {{a swash plate}} type drive, a captive cam or eccentric, <b>barrel</b> <b>cam,</b> or other rotary to linear drive. Modern tools are built with variants {{of all of these}} mechanisms. Eccentric cam, crank and scotch yoke drives need balance weights to reduce vibration in the plane of the rotating element, and may still exhibit vibration that is objectionable to a user of a handheld saw and can lead to difficulty in controlling a cut. The swash plate drive has the advantage that there is little rotational out of balance, so the principal vibration is in line with the blade. This is generally controllable by keeping the foot of a handheld tool against the work.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{simulation}} of the cam actuator of a robotized gearbox is presented. The actuator is a <b>barrel</b> <b>cam</b> which moves a pin {{according to a}} prescribed motion law. The model of contact, between cam and follower, {{is based on a}} finite elements approach of the theory of beam on continuous elastic foundation, modified by the authors to include the effect of shear on the deformation and dynamic effects. The foundation modulus is computed using Hertz theory taking also into account the change of principal curvature values during the relative motion between cam and follower. This model has been embodied in a complete gear shifting simulation in order to compare the effects on contact forces, wear actions and shifting time of different cam profiles.

50|$|The {{design was}} {{generally}} based on American firearms inventor John Browning's Browning Hi-Power, as adapted by Piotr Wilniewczyc and Jan Skrzypiński in 1930 at the Fabryka Broni (Arms Factory) in Radom under Director Kazimierz Ołdakowski. It operated on the short-recoil principle, with the <b>barrel</b> being <b>cammed</b> down {{and away from}} the locking lugs in the slide.|$|R

50|$|Cam Locks: on spudguns with {{interchangeable}} <b>barrels</b> a <b>cam</b> lock {{is sometimes}} used to connect barrels to the cannon as {{it provides a}} quick and simple solution to switching barrels.

40|$|High {{launch costs}} and mission {{requirements}} drive {{the need for}} low mass excavators with mobility platforms, which in turn have little traction and excavation reaction capacity in low gravity environments. This presents the need for precursor and long term future missions with low mass robotic mining technology to perform In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) tasks. This paper discusses a series of experiments that investigate {{the effectiveness of a}} percussive digging device to reduce excavation loads and thereby the mass of the excavator itself. The goal of percussive excavation is to fluidize dry regolith in front of {{the leading edge of the}} tool by mechanically separating the microscopic interlocking grains resulting in a reduced force needed to shear the soil. There are several variables involved with this technique; this experiment varied: Impact energy, frequency, and excavation speed and held constant: impact direction, depth of cut, angle of tool, and soil bulk density. The test apparatus consisted of an aluminum truss bridge with a central pivoting arm. Attached to the arm was a winch with a load cell in line that recorded the tension in the cable and therefore the excavation load. The arm could be adjusted for excavation depth which was recorded along with the arm angle relative to the bridge. A percussive mechanism and 30 " wide pivoting bucket were attached at the end of the arm simulating a basic backhoe with a percussion direction tangent to the direction of. movement. Internally the mechanism used a set of die springs and <b>barrel</b> <b>cam</b> to produce the percussive blow. By changing the springs and the speed of the motor the impact energy and frequency of percussion could be varied independently. Impact energies from 11. 2 J to 30. 5 J and frequencies from 0 BPM to 700 BPM were investigated. A reduction in excavation force of as much as 51 % was achieved in this experimental investigation. Smaller percussive digging implements, tested by others, have achieved a reduction of as much as 72 %. This paper will examine the effects of impact energy, frequency, scaling and their effect on excavation forces in a dry granular material such as lunar regolith. The past several years have shown an increasing interest in mining space resources both for exploration and commercial enterprises. This work studied the benefits and risks of percussive excavation and prelimin~ry results indicate that this technique may become an enabling technology for extra-terrestrial excavation of regolith and ice...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} {{to the analysis of}} the surface form of spatial cams, based on envelope theory, is illustrated. The method, previously developed by the authors, is applied here to spool winding <b>cams.</b> These groove-type <b>barrel</b> <b>cams</b> employ followers having flank radii signijicantly larger than the groove width, implying particular problems in defining the form of the cam sw$ace.

5000|$|The K100 uses a rare locking system, {{similar in}} some ways to the Beretta Cougar, Px4 Storm, and Brügger & Thomet MP9 which employs a {{rotating}} barrel lock, which in the K100's case is cammed by a cross pin. When the pistol is fired the barrel and slide move backward together for about 3/8 of an inch while the <b>barrel</b> is <b>cammed</b> clockwise (with respect to the shooter) by a flat, twisting, helical [...] "cut" [...] in the barrel extension. Once the barrel and slide have moved back {{to the point where the}} barrel has twisted about 45°, the slide is free to continue traveling back while the barrel's travel is arrested by its interface to the frame via the barrel extension's square shoulders. On the K100, the Beretta's <b>barrel</b> extension <b>cam</b> cut, and transfer block's cam tooth, are replaced by a curled, twisting cut in the barrel extension, and a round, frame-embedded cross-pin respectively. As such, there is no transfer block (locking block) per se, and the barrel extension directly interfaces with the frame via the replaceable cross-pin. The design allows a low bore axis relative to the shooter's hand and avoids the use of the transfer/locking block typically found in rotating barrel pistols.|$|R
50|$|The CZ 75 {{is a short}} recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It {{uses the}} Browning linkless cam locking system {{similar to that used}} in the Browning Hi-Power pistol, where the barrel and slide are locked {{together}} on firing, using locking lugs milled into the barrel mating with recesses in the roof of the slide. An enclosed cam track integral with the barrel is actuated by the slide release lever's transverse pin. After the first few millimetres of the recoil stroke, the <b>barrel</b> is <b>cammed</b> downwards at the rear, enabling the slide to continue the recoil stroke and eject the spent cartridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{conversion}} from musket to breechloader {{was done}} by milling open the barrel's breech section and inserting a hinged breechblock fastened {{to the top of}} the <b>barrel.</b> A thumb-operated <b>cam</b> latch at the rear of the breechblock held it shut when in closed position. The rack-type system extractor was withdrawn automatically as the breechblock was opened and snapped back at the end of its stroke. The firing pin was housed within the breechblock. The hammer nose was flattened to accommodate the firing pin.|$|R
50|$|While the M75 had no variants, Philco-Ford {{developed}} an improved derivative, the M129, which quickly supplanted the M75. The M129 was effectively a redesign {{of the older}} weapon to incorporate a concentric cam and improved mount, {{as well as a}} higher rate of fire of 400 rpm. The major problem with the M75 was the torque created due to the barrel being below the operating drum. In the M129 the barrel is concentric with the drum and the excessive torque is thus eliminated. The M129 was used in the XM8 and the aforementioned M28 helicopter armament systems, as well as, the XM51 for the ill-fated AH-56 Cheyenne, and being trialed as a door gun for the UH-1 series with the XM94 system. Operation of the weapon is extremely {{similar to that of the}} M75, with the reciprocating <b>barrel</b> and <b>cam</b> assembly still presenting itself, and the weapon still being electrically driven.|$|R
2500|$|The {{weapon is}} {{described}} as an [...] "air-cooled, electrically powered, rapid firing weapon." [...] All portions of the firing cycle are powered this way so the unit requires an external power source. Other important features are the reciprocating <b>barrel</b> and <b>cam</b> assembly that drive the other components of the system. All phases of the weapon cycle are positively controlled by the drum cam assembly in which a planetary gear train is enclosed, responsible for reducing the motor's high speed to the desired rate for the gun. The 5/8 horsepower 28 Volts DC motor is mounted on the turret bracket and drives the drum cam through a flexible shaft in order to isolate it from the weapon's recoil. The weapon accepts linked ammunition, which was fed from rotary drums {{in the case of}} the M5 and M28 systems, and from boxes {{in the case of the}} XM9 systems. [...] The M5 could also use a box magazine.|$|R

25|$|The Glock's frame, {{magazine}} body, {{and several}} other components are made from a high-strength nylon-based polymer invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2. This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than carbon steel and most steel alloys. Polymer 2 is resistant to shock, caustic liquids, and temperature extremes where traditional steel/alloy frames would warp and become brittle. The injection-molded frame contains four hardened steel guide rails for the slide: two {{at the rear of}} the frame, and the remaining pair above and in front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and checkered. The grip has an angle of 109° and a nonslip, stippled surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps. The frame houses the locking block, which is an investment casting that engages a 45° camming surface on the <b>barrel's</b> lower <b>camming</b> lug. It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds the trigger and slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide catch, which is secured from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded into the frame.|$|R
50|$|The MAG-95 pistol relies to a {{large extent}} on design {{features}} from the later Browning designs, and others, combining features from several weapons into one pistol. The locking system is the widely used dropping <b>barrel</b> and <b>cam</b> action of the Browning series. This is combined with a double-action trigger mechanism combined with a hammer decocking lever which allows the external hammer to be lowered in safety when a round is chambered. Only a positive 50 N pull on the trigger will allow the hammer to recock for firing the round. The barrel is chrome plated to prolong its life and to permit easier cleaning. The MAG-95 is suitable for use by both right and left-handed users and is designed for two-handed operation. It is claimed that the pistols are well balanced to produce greater accuracy when rapid firing. The box magazine contains 15 rounds; optional 20 and 10-round magazines are available. Other options include a laser target indicator to be mounted in front of the trigger guard. The standard finish is a matte black lacquer coating but a bright or matte chrome finish is optional. The MAG-98 incorporates a buffer while the MAG-98c, also with a buffer, is primarily a sporting pistol.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the later}} {{generation}} Beretta 92/96/M9 series, the Px4's trigger guard is rounded for better concealed carry. The takedown pin of earlier models {{is replaced by}} a spring-loaded bar, accessed via frame recesses on both sides, which must be grasped and pulled down simultaneously to release the slide. The slide spring is doubly captive, being inserted approximately an inch into the transfer block at one end and a receiving hole {{in the front of the}} slide at the other. It is a self-contained assembly, completely captured by the polymer guide. The magazine holds the top round directly behind the barrel's breech end so only a slight feed ramp is needed. This allows the barrel to fully support the case. The 6-R rifling of the barrel generates counter-clockwise torque which is harnessed by the locking system to reduce the amount of pressure required from the rotating <b>barrel</b> lock's <b>cam</b> and pin system to effect unlocking. The steel transfer block's cam pin is 5 mm wide and 2 mm deep. The entire hammer unit mechanism can be removed from the Px4, without the use of special tools, as a single group. This allows easy access to the firing mechanism for cleaning. The Px4's design makes it impossible to assemble incorrectly from a field-stripped takedown.|$|R
2500|$|Behind {{the bolt}} carrier is a plastic or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a return spring. The buffer spring begins to push the bolt carrier and bolt back toward the chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides the bolt cam pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The bolt's locking lugs push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by feed ramps into the chamber. As the bolt's locking lugs move past the <b>barrel</b> extension, the <b>cam</b> pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces the bolt to twist and [...] "lock" [...] into the barrel extension.|$|R
50|$|The Hi-Power, {{like many}} other Browning designs, {{operates}} on the short-recoil principle, where the barrel and slide initially recoil together until the barrel is unlocked from the slide by a cam arrangement. Unlike Browning's earlier Colt M1911 pistol, the barrel is not moved vertically by a toggling link, but instead by a hardened bar which crosses the frame under the barrel and contacts a slot under the chamber, at the rearmost part of the barrel. The barrel and slide recoil together for a short distance but, as the slot engages the bar, the chamber and {{the rear of the}} barrel are drawn downward and stopped. The downward movement of the barrel disengages it from the slide, which continues rearward, extracting the spent case from the chamber and ejecting it while also re-cocking the hammer. After the slide reaches the limit of its travel, the recoil spring brings it forward again, stripping a new round from the magazine and pushing it into the chamber. This also pushes the chamber and <b>barrel</b> forward. The <b>cam</b> slot and bar move the chamber upward and the locking lugs on the barrel re-engage those in the slide.|$|R
