40|$|Effects of each bile {{component}} {{which was}} added into preculture medium on spore-forming (SP-F) and enterotoxin-producing (ET-P) abilities in sporulation medium of Clostridium perfringens, NCTC 8798, 8238, have been studied. Bile acids, mucin and lecithin enhanced <b>the</b> <b>both</b> abilities of <b>the</b> <b>both</b> strains, but cholesterol and bilirubin did not. That is, cholic, glycocholic and taurocholic acids in concentration from 0. 5 or 1 % to 5 % enhanced <b>the</b> <b>both</b> abilities of <b>the</b> <b>both</b> strains. Deoxycholic acid in 0. 5 or 1 % enhanced <b>the</b> <b>both</b> abilities of <b>the</b> <b>both</b> strains, but it in 3 or 5 % diminished those abilities. Glycodeoxycholic acid and taurodeoxycholic acid from 0. 5 or 1 % to 3 or 5 % enhanced the SP-F ability of <b>the</b> <b>both</b> strains, and <b>the</b> latter in 3 and 5 % enhanced the ET-P ability of 8238. Chenodeoxycholic acid in 0. 5 or 1 % and over diminished <b>the</b> <b>both</b> abilities of <b>the</b> <b>both</b> strains, but glyco- and tauro-chenodeoxycholic acids in 0. 5 or 1 % and over enhanced those abilities. Lithocholic acid in 1 or 3 % gave the maxima of <b>the</b> <b>both</b> abilities to <b>the</b> <b>both</b> strains. Mucin in 3 and 5 % and lecithin in 0. 5 or 1 % enhanced <b>the</b> <b>both</b> abilities of <b>the</b> <b>both</b> strains. <b>The</b> SP-F and ET-P abilities {{are discussed in}} connection with the food poisoning. 前培養培地に単独に添加した胆汁成分がウェルシュ菌NCTC 8798, 8238 の胞子形成培地における胞子形成能力およびエンテロトキシン(ET) 産生能力に及ぼす影響を検討した。コール酸,グリココール酸およびタウロコール酸は 0. 5 或いは 1 %から 5 %の範囲で両菌株の胞子形成能力およびET産生能力を増加させた。デオキシコール酸は 0. 5 或いは 1 %で両菌株の両能力を増加させたが, 3 或いは 5 %ではそれら能力を減少させた。グリコーおよびタウローデオキシコール酸は 0. 5 或いは 1 %から 3 或いは 5 %の範囲で両菌株の胞子形成能力を,また,後者は 3 および 5 %で 8238 のET産生能力を増加させた。ケノデオキシコール酸は 0. 5 或いは 1 %以上で両菌株の両能力を減少させたが,グリコーおよびタウローケノデオキシコール酸は 0. 5 或いは 1 %以上でそれらの能力を増加させた。リトコール酸は 1 或いは 3 %で両菌株に最高の両能力を与えた。ムチンは 3 および 5 %で,レシチンは 0. 5 或いは 1 %で両能力を増加させた。ビリルビンは 5 %で胞子形成能力を減少させ, 1 或いは 3 %以上でET産生能力を減少させた...|$|R
