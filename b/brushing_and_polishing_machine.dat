40|$|A new {{technique}} of end facet polishing for polymer on glass optical waveguide is presented. The technique {{is based on}} the combination of mechanical <b>and</b> chemical <b>polishing</b> <b>and</b> the process is worked on the grinding <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> <b>machine.</b> The process starts with the waveguide cutting followed by the facet's grinding. Three sizes of silicon carbide (SiC) were used; 240 grit, 800 grit and 1200 grit. The process ends with the three steps of chemical polishing which is based on diamond paste compound. Based on the said processes, the waveguide samples are shown to produce excellent facets quality when physically inspected under the high power microscope and scanning electron microscope...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{spite of}} the facts that coffee is highly {{economical}} and can boost the country’s revenue, coffee production is fast declining in Nigeria and the participation of farmers has become very low. This {{may be attributed to}} inadequate processing technology as result of the high level of drudgery involve in the shelling of the coffee bean by manual method. Therefore, there is need to develop a dehulling <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> <b>machine</b> that will help increase both the quality and production of coffee seed. This work was aimed at the design, construction and performance evaluation of a combined coffee bean dehulling <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> <b>machine.</b> The two units-dehulling <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> units were incorporated in a single machine in order to prevent drudgery associated with the traditional method of dehulling and separation of the hull from the dehulled coffee bean seed. The first unit of the machine consist of a hopper; through which the coffee was fed into the the machine, and dehulling cylinder; which houses the dehulling shaft that dehulls the bean. The second unit of the machine consists of the <b>polishing</b> drum <b>and</b> <b>brushes,</b> attached to the dehulling shaft. The performance of the machine was evaluated following optimum operating condition of the length of dehulling shaft, speed of rotation of the dehulling shaft <b>and</b> the rotating <b>brushes</b> attached to the rotating shaft in polishing unit of the machine. Based on this conditions, the worked optimally at the rate of 180 kg/hr. the result showed that the performance of the machine were 56. 67 % and 64. 66 % respectively for dehulling <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> unit. This was obtained at a dehulling head of 500 rpm as the speed of the dehulling shaft...|$|R

But with their low mass, high strength, and excellent resistance to corrosion, titanium alloys solve many engineering challenges. In this study, high speed end milling of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V was applied as a potential machining technique for obtaining better surface finish using small diameter tools applying high rpm to facilitate the application of micro-meter level feed and depth of cut to ensure super finishing that could avoid the need of further grinding <b>and</b> <b>polishing.</b> <b>Machining</b> was performed on a Vertical Machining Centre (VMC) with a high speed attachment (HES 510), using cutting speed, depth of cut, and feed as machining variables. Three level full factorial designs were followed for machining operations. Minimum average surface roughness (Ra) value of 0. 13 µm was obtained which is within the acceptable range of avoiding grinding <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> operations.
