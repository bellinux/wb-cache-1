30|$|The {{link between}} {{individuals}} and their biometric (physiological) characteristics is considered strong and permanent, particularly for iris [3]. Therefore, iris-codes must be protected in order to safeguard individuals’ privacy and <b>biometric</b> systems’ <b>security.</b> Albeit this is rarely the case in operational systems, favourable capture conditions (resulting in low intra-class variance) are considered a fundamental premise for biometric cryptosystems. Consequentially, compared to conventional recognition systems, biometric cryptosystems suffer from {{a significant decrease in}} biometric performance. Multi-biometric cryptosystems, which should be designed to combine multiple biometric characteristics at feature level [21], might bridge the gap between biometric performance and privacy protection [19].|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{method for}} palmprint recognition, called Fisherpalms, is proposed. In this method, each pixel of a palmprint image is {{considered}} as a coordinate in a high-dimensional image space. A linear projection based on Fisher's linear discriminant is used to project palmprints from this high-dimensional original palmprint space to a significantly lower dimensional feature space (Fisherpalm space), in which the palmprints from the different palms can be discriminated much more efficiently. The relationship between the recognition accuracy and {{the resolution of the}} palmprint image is also investigated. The experimental results show that, in the proposed method, the palmprint images with resolution 32 × 32 are optimal for medium <b>security</b> <b>biometric</b> systems while those with resolution 64 × 64 are optimal for high <b>security</b> <b>biometric</b> systems. High accuracies (> 99 %) have been obtained by the proposed method and the speed of this method (responding time ≤ 0. 4 s) is rapid enough for real-time palmprint recognition.
