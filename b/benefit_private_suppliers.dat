40|$|BACKGROUND: In Tanzania {{the supply}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} is from public and private. In public sector Medical Stores Department is the sole supplier of pharmaceuticals to public health facilities. When MSD is out of stoc k of some items, the public health facilities purchase from <b>private</b> <b>suppliers.</b> It is not known if these health facilities follow the rules and regulation set in the Public Procurement Act of 2011 and its Regulations when procuring from these <b>private</b> <b>suppliers.</b> This study explores the reasons for procure from <b>private</b> <b>suppliers</b> and if the health facilities follows appropriate procurement methods and tendering process {{as stated in the}} Act. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of the study was to}} explore the procurement practic es in district hospitals, whether they adhere to policies and regulations when purchasing pharmaceuticals from private suppliers; and to identify challenges faced by these public hospitals during the whole process. METHODOLOGY:A cross sectional design was used. The study was conducted in five district hospitals, three from Dar-es-salaam; Amana, Mwananyamala and Temeke and two from Coast region including Bagamoyo and Tumbi. A number of recorded documents were reviewed to capture informations on procurement process. A sub study was done through use of structured questionnaire to assess the level of knowledge of personnels dealing with procurement in selected health facilities and challenges faced when procuring pharmaceuticals from <b>private</b> <b>suppliers.</b> RESULTS: The study revealed a number of weakness in implentation of PP Act and its Regulations, including lack of of Annual Procurement Plans, non compliance with contract specification, poor record keeping of adverts, and Time for submission of price quotation. Some of the major challenges facing the pharmaceutical sector include high price of pharmaceuticals, failure of suppliers to fulfill orders and meeting specification, insufficient funds to pay for pharmaceuticals and the process is time consuming. These le ad to unsafe practices, and reliance on outside agencies. Despite of the mention weakness, these hospitals performed better in number of indicators; the use of appropriate procurement method, Establishment of Tender Board and establishment of Evaluation sub-committee. vi CONCLUSION: Procurement of pharmaceuticals from <b>private</b> <b>suppliers</b> in public hospitals is not adhering to regulation. The hospitals over use fund due to lack of procurement plans, therefore products are procured out of estimated budget. Despite the fact <b>Private</b> <b>suppliers</b> are alternative source of MSD still they fail to fulfill orders and complying according to specifications. Personneldealing with procurement have moderate level of knowledgeable with regard to tendering procedure...|$|R

40|$|In the United States, the two {{principal}} modes of producing local government services are in-house provision by government employees and contracting out to <b>private</b> <b>suppliers,</b> {{also known as}} privatization. We examine empirically how U. S. counties choose the mode of providing services. The evidence indicates that state clean-government laws and state laws restricting county spending encourage privatization, whereas strong public unions discourage it. This points to the important roles played by political patronage and taxpayer resistance to government spending in the privatization decision. ...|$|R

40|$|Do firms {{systematically}} over- or underinvest as {{a result}} of agency problems? We develop a contracting model between shareholders and managers in which managers have <b>private</b> <b>benefits</b> or <b>private</b> costs of investment. Managers overinvest when they have <b>private</b> <b>benefits</b> and underinvest when they have private costs. Optimal incentive contracts mitigate the over- or underinvestment problem. We derive comparative static predictions for the equilibrium relationships between incentives from compensation, investment, and firm performance for both cases. The relationship between firm performance and managerial incentives, in isolation, is insufficient to identify whether managers have <b>private</b> <b>benefits</b> or <b>private</b> costs of investment. In order to identify whether managers have <b>private</b> <b>benefits</b> or costs, we estimate the joint relationships between incentives and firm performance and between incentives and investment. Our empirical results show that both firm performance and investment are increasing in managerial incentives. These results are consistent with managers having private costs of investment. We find no support for overinvestment based on <b>private</b> <b>benefits.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We empirically {{decompose}} <b>private</b> <b>benefits</b> into benefits accruing from {{ownership and}} benefits accruing from control. We document that <b>private</b> <b>benefits</b> increase slowly {{with respect to}} the ownership level but increase rapidly {{with respect to the}} blockholder's likelihood of exercising control. The decomposition of <b>private</b> <b>benefits</b> allows us to quantify the magnitude of nonpecuniary <b>private</b> <b>benefits</b> by examining the block premium when the blockholder's likelihood of exercising control is close to zero. We find that the size of nonpecuniary <b>private</b> <b>benefits</b> ranges from 0. 61 % to 5. 92 % of the share price, or 18 % to 29 % of the total <b>private</b> <b>benefits.</b> Copyright (c) 2009 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association. ...|$|R
