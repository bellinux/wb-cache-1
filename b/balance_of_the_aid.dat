Supervisor: Mgr. Zuzana Hamarová Pages: 92 Annex: 17 Year: 2014 Key words: Knee joint, rupture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior cruciate ligament, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, senzomotoric stimulation, balance <b>aids</b> <b>The</b> thesis deals with <b>the</b> possibilities <b>of</b> using sensomotoric patients after plastic surgery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior cruciate ligament. For both me selected patients was used ST/G graft. In the theoretical section summarizes anatomical knowledge, information about biomechanics, the way LCA injury, the subsequent surgical treatment and <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> examination and rehabilitation after knee injury. The work is also given to sensomotoric and potential uses <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>aids.</b> <b>The</b> empirical part describes the examination, but also therapy using sensomotoric {{at a young age}} of two patients after ACL reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|Background: Standards {{for patient}} {{decision}} aids require {{that information and}} options be presented in a balanced manner; this requirement {{is based on the}} argument that balanced presentation is essential to foster informed decision making. If information is presented in an incomplete/non-neutral manner, it can stimulate cognitive biases that can unduly affect individuals' knowledge, perceptions of risks and benefits, and, ultimately, preferences. However, there is little clarity about what constitutes balance, and how it can be determined and enhanced. We conducted a literature review to examine the theoretical and empirical evidence related to <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> information and options. Methods: A literature search related to patient decision aids and balance was conducted on Medline, using MeSH terms and PubMed; this search supplemented the 2011 Cochrane Collaboration's review of patient decision aids trials. Only English language articles relevant to patient decision making and addressing <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> information and options were included. All members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team independently screened clusters of articles; uncertainties were resolved by seeking review by another member. The team then worked in sub-groups to extract and synthesise data on theory, definitions, and evidence reported in these studies. Results: A total of 40 articles met <b>the</b> inclusion criteria. <b>Of</b> these, six explained the rationale for <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> information and options. Twelve defined "balance"; <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> "balance" that emerged is as follows: "The complete and unbiased presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relevant options and the information about those options-in content and in format-in a way that enables individuals to process this information without bias". Ten <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 40 articles reported assessing <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relevant decision <b>aid.</b> All 10 did so exclusively from the users' or patients' perspective, using a five-point Likert-type scale. Presenting information in a side-by-side display form was associated with more respondents (ranging from 70 % to 96 %) judging the information as "balanced". Conclusion: There is a need for comparative studies investigating different ways to improve and measure <b>balance</b> in <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> information and options in patient decision aids...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> issue <b>of</b> deep {{stabilization}} system is still topical at present as its dysfunction causes vertebrogenic problems, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most frequent causes of disability to work. The deep {{stabilization system}} represents a functional stabilization unit including particularly diaphragm, mm. multifidi, abdominal wall muscles and pelvic bottom muscles. Balanced interaction between muscles is important as this system participates in backbone stabilization and {{is involved in}} all moves. A foot {{is an important part}} of stabilization system as stabilization of vertically standing body starts in the foot inner muscles. Qualitative research, <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> case study was applied on the data collection. The research was performed for 9 to 12 weeks on a sample of 4 probands who suffered from vertebrogenic problems. <b>The</b> examination <b>of</b> probands consisted of anamnesis, static and dynamic check-up of aspections, palpation examination, examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deep stabilization system by functional test and examination <b>of</b> feet. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis was to outline how <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot affects the deep stabilization system and to propose a set of exercises and aids for its correct activation. <b>The</b> theoretical part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis describes foot anatomy and function and the most important part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deep stabilization system, its examination and therapeutic possibilities including proper use <b>of</b> <b>aids.</b> <b>The</b> practical part presents <b>the</b> aims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research, describes the methodology and results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research elaborated in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> case studies. <b>The</b> Annex also contains a set <b>of</b> exercises affecting <b>the</b> deep stabilization system with application <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>aids.</b> <b>The</b> research results show that body posture has improved in all the probands, all the patients were capable of isolated contraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual DSS parts and functional involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole system. Influencing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feet and the whole system led to better stability and graphesthesia on the foot sole, backache has subsided. This thesis may be used in physiotherapeutic clinical practice or as educational material for patients...|$|R

The {{results show that}} <b>the</b> mass <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier has recently shown a deficit trend, and that the glacial terminus was also retreating. Positive mass <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier was dominant during the period 1989 – 1993, and the accumulated mass balance reached 970 mm. However, negative mass <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier has occurred since 1994, except for the large positive mass balance year 1997. The mass balance was 701 mm in 1998, an extremely negative glacier mass balance year.

5000|$|Correct {{position}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rider: Some riders have a {{habit of}} riding crookedly when performing lateral movements, especially if the horse tends to do so. To counteract this, it is often {{a good idea to}} have a person on the ground watch your position. Common faults to avoid include <b>the</b> dropping <b>of</b> a shoulder, raising or lowering a hand, collapsing a hip, leaning (rather than staying centered over the saddle), and twisting the body. Although it may be possible to perform correct movements when the rider's body is contorted, it makes it more difficult, decreases <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rider, and reduces <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seat which tends to decrease <b>the</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aids.</b> Loss <b>of</b> position also tends to give incorrect signals to the horse, and if it creates a stiff seat, will make the horse move stiffly, discourage impulsion, suppleness, and forwardness, and therefore decrease <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exercise.|$|R

40|$|Use of inter-loop aiding for {{improving}} tracking performance {{has been widely}} researched in recent years. However, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previously proposed <b>aiding</b> schemes rely {{on the assumption that}} <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop remains unaffected by received interference. This paper argues that this may not always be the case. It is likely that <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop may also degrade in the case where interference is received at <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> carrier’s frequency resulting in performance degradation of both aiding and aided loops. This paper proposes an aiding scheme that offers performance improvements in case interference corrupts both frequencies. Also, an algorithm is proposed that continuously updates <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop bandwidth to keep its jitter at a minimum. A relationship between <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> signal and its effects on <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop is analysed. An adaptive Kalman filter-based implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> architecture is proposed to improve <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>aiding</b> estimates. This implementation offers an improved margin against received interference. Simulation and real data results are presented that show improvements of 7 and 5 dB-Hz in this margin by employing <b>the</b> proposed <b>aiding</b> scheme with and without an adaptive Kalman filter...|$|R
