25|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, <b>Beijing</b> <b>has</b> {{witnessed}} tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most {{pronounced in the}} CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and neofuturistic style of architecture {{can be seen at}} the 798 Art Zone, which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's current completed tallest building is the 330-meter China World Trade Center Tower III, but will be surpassed by the 528-meter China Zun in 2018 when it is completed. Both buildings are in the Beijing CBD.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} of these seals was the Heirloom Seal of the Realm, which was created by the First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, and was seen as a legitimising device embodying or symbolising the Mandate of Heaven. The Heirloom Seal was passed down through several dynasties, but had been lost {{by the beginning of the}} Ming dynasty. This partly explains the Qing emperors' obsession with creating numerous imperial seals - for the emperors' official use alone the Forbidden City in <b>Beijing</b> <b>has</b> a collection of 25 seals - in order to reduce the significance of the Heirloom Seal.|$|E
25|$|In April 2016 the Traffic Management Bureau {{under the}} Ministry of Public Security {{announced}} {{the introduction of}} new green license plates to identify new energy vehicles, as opposed to the country's standard blue plates. The NEV plates include a Chinese character short for the provincial region where they are issued, and seven numbers and letters, compared to six on standard plates. The objective of the special plates is to facilitate police enforcement of the preferential policies that some local authorities apply to cleaner cars to help cut emissions and ease traffic. For example, central <b>Beijing</b> <b>has</b> in place a road space rationing scheme, a driving restriction regulation that bans conventional vehicles from entering the city for one day a week, but new energy vehicles are exempted from the restriction. Beijing also introduced a vehicle quota system in 2011, awarding new car licenses through a lottery, with a ceiling of 6 million units for 2017. New energy vehicles were placed in a special category where the odds of winning a license plate are much higher than conventional autos.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} two interpretations of Chen's actions during the {{election}} in terms of independence politics. The first {{is that he is}} ideologically committed to advancing Taiwan independence and that his actions are intended to systematically remove the constraints which prevent this from occurring. Seen in this light, his actions are intended to provoke a crisis in which the PRC must either start a war or accept independence, with the expectation that the PRC would back down. Ironically, this interpretation of his actions is shared both among his most fervent supporters (who think it is a good thing) and his most bitter opponents (who think that it is a bad thing). It is largely to counter this possibility that the PRC has issued statements that it will definitely go to war if certain red lines are crossed. However, they in reality carry little meaning, as <b>Beijing</b> <b>has</b> made such statements warning against electing former President Lee and Chen in the 1996 and 2000 elections, which both failed to materialize. Some people regard these statements now as reverse psychology, as Lee and Chen may help to weaken ROC and advance the unification process.|$|E
500|$|Chen Shirong, China editor on the BBC World Service, remarked at the {{improvement}} in media management by Xinhua: [...] "To be more credible, it released video footage {{a few hours after}} the event, not two weeks." [...] Peter Foster of the Daily Telegraph observed that [...] "long-standing China commentators have been astonished at the speed at which <b>Beijing</b> <b>has</b> moved to seize the news agenda on this event," [...] and attributed it to his belief that [...] "China doesn't have a great deal to hide". A University of California, Berkeley academic agreed that the Chinese authorities had become more sophisticated. The New York Times and AFP recognised the Chinese learnt lessons from political protests around the world, such as the so-called colour revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine, and the 2009 Iranian election protests, and concluded that Chinese experts had studied how modern electronic communications [...] "helped protesters organize and reach the outside world, and for ways that governments sought to counter them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the early}} 1980s, the urban area of <b>Beijing</b> <b>has</b> {{expanded}} greatly with {{the completion of}} the 2nd Ring Road in 1981 and the subsequent addition of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Ring Roads. According to one 2005 newspaper report, the size of newly developed Beijing was one-and-a-half times larger than before. Wangfujing and Xidan have developed into flourishing shopping districts, while Zhongguancun has become a major center of electronics in China. In recent years, the expansion of <b>Beijing</b> <b>has</b> also brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization, such as heavy traffic, poor air quality, the loss of historic neighborhoods, and a significant influx of migrant workers from less-developed rural areas of the country. [...] <b>Beijing</b> <b>has</b> also been the location of many significant events in recent Chinese history, principally the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

2500|$|The city's history {{dates back}} three millennia. As {{the last of}} the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, <b>Beijing</b> <b>has</b> been the {{political}} center of the country {{for much of the past}} eight centuries. With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital. Beijing was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium A.D. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates. Its art treasures and universities have made it center of culture and art in China. Encyclopædia Britannica notes that [...] "few cities in the world have served for so long as the political headquarters and cultural centre of an area as immense as China."
