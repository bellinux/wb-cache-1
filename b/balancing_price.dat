40|$|Abstract-Real-time {{balancing}} of the European {{electricity grid}} {{will become increasingly}} dependent on market-based control mechanisms that are enabled by connecting millions of prosumers to an open communication network. The use of communication systems inevitably introduces delays in the energy balancing con trol loop, which could endanger market operation and stabilit � of the electricity grid. By investigating the interaction between prlce based control algorithms for real-time balancing and information and communication technology, we aim to provide systematic design rules for unrestricted ancillary service markets.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, a {{model is}} {{designed}} to determine the optimum location of a hierarchical production system on a nonhomogeneous plane. The main objective {{of the study is}} to consider explicitly the ways in which alternative spatial pricing policies will affect location choice. The maximum-profit location is obtained by <b>balancing</b> <b>price,</b> demand, production cost, and transportation cost of interdependent production units. A stepwise heuristic approach is used for the solution. The solution procedure starts with the choice of the number of plants for each level of the hierarchy. The optimum set of markets is determined by the use of a minimum-distance criterion, and the demand of each market is calculated with respect to a chosen uniform price. Then the optimum location of plants is determined for each market. This procedure is repeated by using different uniform prices and by changing the number of plants until the maximum profit for the whole system is obtained. ...|$|E
40|$|Optimal trade {{execution}} aims at <b>balancing</b> <b>price</b> {{impact and}} timing risk. With {{respect to the}} mathematical formulation of the optimization problem, we primarily focus on Mean Variance (MV) optimization, {{in which the two}} conflicting objectives are maximizing expected revenue (the flip side of trading impact) and minimizing variance of revenue (a measure of timing risk). We also consider the use of expected quadratic variation of the portfolio value process as an alternative measure of timing risk, which leads to Mean Quadratic Variation (MQV) optimization. We demonstrate that MV-optimal strategies are quite different from MQV-optimal strategies in many aspects. These differences are {{in stark contrast to the}} common belief that MQV-optimal strategies are similar to, or even the same as, MV-optimal strategies. These differences should be of interest to practitioners since we prove that the classic Almgren-Chriss strategies (industry standard) are MQV-optimal, in contrary to the common belief that they are MV-optimal. From a computational point of view, we extend theoretical results in the literature to prove that the mean variance efficient frontier computed using our method is indeed the complete Pareto-efficient frontier. First, we generalize the result in Li (2000) on the embedding technique and develop a post-processing algorithm that guarantees Pareto-optimality of numerically computed efficient frontier. Second, we extend the convergence result in Barles (1990) to viscosity solution of a system of nonlinear Hamilton Jacobi Bellman partial differential equations (HJB PDEs). On the numerical aspect, we combine the techniques of similarity reduction, non-standard interpolation, and careful grid construction to significantly improve the efficiency of our numerical methods for solving nonlinear HJB PDEs...|$|E

This paper derives revenue-maximising and risk-constrained strategies for stochastic generators participating in electricity markets with a single-price balancing mechanism.

40|$|In {{the chain}} of {{electrical}} energy, the proper operation of transmission networks is essential forguaranteeing the reliability of energy supply to consumers. However, for economical andphysical reasons, transmissions network cannot have an infinite capacity. Therefore operatingconstraints such as voltage stability and line overloads can lead to congestions by preventingthe transmission system operator from transferring electricity according to the market desire. To avoid outages due to congestions, congestion management methods have been developedby transmission system operators. In France, congestions are managed by the transmissionsystem operator (RTE: Réseau de Transport d'Electricité) through a balancing mechanism. Itaims at adjusting the production of some specific power plants. This regulation has a cost. This cost paid by RTE is important since it {{has an impact on}} the rate charged for using thepublic transmission and distribution network. However the congestion cost is hardlypredictable since it depends on the availability of load, generation and transmission devices. In this master thesis, historical data will be analyzed to study the geographical structure andthe causes of congestion in French transmission network. Moreover, a method to forecast thecongestion costs will be described. First dynamic simulations are run to find the constraintsissued by voltage stability. Then scenarios are created by a Monte-Carlo simulator to knowthe probability of occurrences of situations with constraints. Finally, the amount of regulatedproduction activated to solve congestion issues must be valued to derive a cost. The pricingissues are tackled by focusing on the marginal <b>balancing</b> <b>price</b> and the prices of the offerssubmitted to the balancing mechanism. The method is used to forecast the congestion costs atseveral horizons of time. The results are analyzed and some other utilization of this methodare discussed...|$|E

An overview of SDS technology, addressing kinematic and free piston engine designs, maintenance requirements, hybrid operation, heat pipe receivers and system capital costs is presented. The safety, environmental and social implications of SDS installations, including the potential impacts upon bird life, {{and the value of}} a supplementary income stream for rural stakeholders is explored, along with suitable sites for system installation, such as salt affected land. Grid connection requirements within the SWIS network, including network capacity constraints, network protection, network performance and the structure of the wholesale electricity market, are discussed in the context of distributed SDS deployment. Analysis of the SWIS market data form 2006 to 2010 provides an average daytime <b>balancing</b> <b>price</b> or Marginal Cost Administered Price (MCAP) 0. 08 AUD/kWh, which is subsequently used in the financial modelling.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{methods to}} {{forecast}} the long-term regulating power prices (RPP) {{evolution in the}} Nordics. During the operating hour the transmission system operatorsbuy balancing power on the regulating power market, and the RPP are the clearingprices. Each market player having caused imbalance is charged an imbalance cost dependingon the RPP. Hence forecasting these prices in the long-term provides valuableinformation for strategic decisions such as wind power investment, power purchase agreementor for market players willing to have revenues from the RPM. First, fundamental approach is investigated. Nord Pool data and probabilistic distributionsare used to forecast the evolution of balancing needs. These volumes are then fedinto models of the <b>balancing</b> <b>price</b> bids ladder, based on the bottom-up model EMPS(EFI 1 's Multi-area Power Simulator), initially developed to model the long term dayaheadprices. Models appeared to perform poorly: results were underestimated and farfrom observed values. In {{the second part of}} this work, a computational intelligence approach using EmpiricalMode Decomposition (EMD) and Articial Neural Networks (ANN) is investigated. Thetrend of regulating prices is extracted with the EMD and forecasted separately withANN. Good results are achieved with the statistical approach, showing the superiorityof this method over the fundamental approach. In the nal part, the results of thestatistical approach are analyzed and conclusions regarding the long-term regulatingprices evolution are drawn for 2017 - 2020.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} {{modelling}} the electricity trading and market mechanism currently {{in place in}} the UK, using an agent-based approach and a learning strategy for the agents to update their bidding rules. The ongoing consultations by the Department of Energy and Climate Change on the possible models for a capacity mechanism reflect the unavoidable shift towards low-carbon and more intermittent sources of generation. One of the issues of concern is the way the system operator adapts the balancing mechanism to run in a more efficient and economical way. Here we present an agent-based model comprising two interconnected parts: a representation of the power exchange and a model of the balancing mechanism along with the settlement system. In order to assess the influence of different types of generation on the system <b>balancing</b> <b>prices,</b> we model the generating units based on the size and type of fuel involved. The agent-based model incorporates the operating decisions and control mechanisms of the system operator, and the functions of various trading entities such as generators and suppliers participating within this market.
