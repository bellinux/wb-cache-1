In other words, we give an explicit combinatorial formula for expanding {{the product of}} a noncommutative power sum symmetric function and a noncommutative Schur function in terms of noncommutative Schur functions.

500|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} pair of jealous {{strippers}} applying lipstick and caddying back-and-forth between backstage, in a South of the <b>Border</b> <b>strip</b> zoo named [...] "La Jungla". Meanwhile, Mars' [...] "Money Make Her Smile" [...] can be heard from the room, the two of them are talking about a new girl who has been [...] "fooling around" [...] with someone else's man (Mr. Mars). The scene ends with one of the two women saying, [...] "Wait 'til I tell the boss what she's sleeping with". It is shown that the new girl, Isabella, has been listening to the conversation and it's her time to dance as soon as the boss says so. The role of Isabella is portrayed by Indian actress Freida Pinto, who after an introduction by Guzmán, the zoo owner, starts to pull off [...] "gravity-defying spins on the pole" [...] as Mars and his mates, who serve as the house band, perform the song. On the following scene, Isabella sheds her clothes with such rage that sparks fall from the ceiling while Mars stares at her intensely singing [...] "You and me baby making love like gorillas". As the second verse starts, intermittent shots of Mars and Isabella [...] "heating up the backseat of a car" [...] along with shots of her [...] "grinding on customers" [...] and banging on Mars' chest as he sings the line [...] "Bang Bang, Gorilla". The former shots are shown throughout the video. As the video continues, Isabella is shown [...] "to drop on her knees and lick" [...] Mars' guitar. She grabs it and pours tequila over the same, before using a lighter to set it on fire. Afterwards, the roof sprinklers come on and Isabella lets the water shower her while she stands on her underwear. The video ends in a chase scene in which Mars runs down through a dimly lit aisle, and suddenly transforms into a giant gorilla, while Isabella is seen {{at the end of the}} pathway waiting for him. The video doesn't contain any of the teasers Mars released days before the video, including the iguana shot, the outer car scene and the one with Luis Guzman listening to the intro for Isabella.|$|E

2500|$|To {{maintain}} {{what the}} East German state called Ordnung und Sicherheit ("order and security") along the border, local civilians were co-opted {{to assist the}} border guards and police. A decree of 5June 1958 spoke of encouraging [...] "the working population in the border districts of the GDR [...] the desire to help by volunteering to guarantee the inviolability of the border." [...] Civilians living in villages along the border were recruited into the [...] "Border Helpers" [...] (Grenzhelfer) and [...] "People's Police Helpers" [...] (Volkspolizeihelfer). They were tasked with patrolling the strip behind the border defences, assisting at control checkpoints and reporting any unusual activities or strangers in their area. In one border community, Kella in Thuringia, the mayor boasted in a 1967 speech that nearly two-thirds of arrests on the border that year {{had been made by}} local civilians. The locals were, however, kept away from the <b>border</b> <b>strip</b> itself.

The (Durfee or Frobenius) rank of #, denoted rank(#), is {{the length of}} the main diagonal of the diagram of #, or equivalently, the largest integer i for which # i # i [11, p. 289]. We will assume familiarity with the notation and terminology involving partitions and symmetric functions found in [7] and [11]. Nazarov and Tarasov [9, 1], in connection with tensor products of Yangian modules Y (gl n), defined a generalization of rank to skew partitions (or skew diagrams) #/. There are several simple equivalent definitions of rank(#/) which we summarize in Proposition 2. 2. In particular, rank(#/) is the least integer r such that #/ is a disjoint union of r <b>border</b> <b>strips</b> (also called ribbons or rim hooks). In Section 4 we consider the structure of the decompositions of #/ into this minimal number r of <b>border</b> <b>strips.</b> For instance, we show that the number of ways to write #/ as a di...|$|R
