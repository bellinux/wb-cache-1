In order to study the slope instability evolution of this area, satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, acquired during the last 20 years, have been processed and analyzed. These data have been acquired by using C-band and X-band sensors.

This article first explores whether the sample's rule designs enable potentially excessive irrigation water use to be monitored and sanctioned. It then examines whether this potential to monitor and sanction is exploited under the given stakeholder constellation. The {{results of the study}} show that excessive water use and delays in irrigation handover could only be monitored and sanctioned in one case. In many cases, the rule design leads to a low potential to <b>back</b> <b>monitoring</b> with sanctioning, which is why monitoring becomes less effective. Furthermore, in these cases, the stakeholder constellation and group size have a major effect on the effort required to monitor excessive water use...|$|R

40|$|Exploiting two {{unexpected}} {{variations in}} sickness absence policy for civil servants in Italy, this paper assesses {{the relative importance}} of monitoring and monetary incentives in determining a basic measure of effort: presence at work. When stricter monitoring was introduced together with an average 20 % cut in replacement rates for civil servants on short sick leave, sickness absence decreased by 26. 4 %, eliminating the wedge in absence rates with comparable private sector workers. The impact substantially decreased when a subsequent policy change brought <b>back</b> <b>monitoring</b> to the pre-reform level, while leaving monetary incentives untouched. Results are confirmed by a variety of robustness checks and are not driven by the presence of attenuation bias. No shift is detected in other types of absence {{as a consequence of the}} reforms. Given that sickness absence rates are higher in the public than in the private sector in the US and Western Europe as well, these results provide useful insights on how to draw a successful strategy for addressing absenteeism. monetary incentives, monitoring, effort, sickness absence...|$|R

Until now a few tools have been developed that provides efficient resource metering and monitoring in virtual environment (Z/VM) but every business has its own requirements and system setup so mostly these tools need some customizations to fit into the business. This work mainly concentrated on what kind of resource utilization data is available on Z/VM and on LINUX guests running on Z/VM to effectively charge the customers running there guest Linux Operating systems in virtual environment (Z/VM based) and to monitor the cpu and memory utilization to check whether the estimate of memory allocation for linux guests running different applications made by system (PWSS) is a good estimate or require some optimizations.
