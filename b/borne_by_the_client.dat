Ofcom suggest that [...] "Anyone wishing to improve coverage {{in a particular area}} is advised to contact their network provider." [...] At present, the willingness and capability of network operators to initiate the process to providing an in building solution varies greatly. Some network operators have dedicated teams that will visit a customers site to assess the cause of the problems experienced and offer to put in place a solution provided by a third party vendor. However this is generally limited to large corporates and the public sector, with the expense being <b>borne</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>client.</b> The disparity in approach and the lack of a cross network operator working group means that sites requiring a 'wideband' coverage solution for all networks is not currently possible.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the cash}} flows of lifetime indexed pensions as {{one source of}} apparent super-profitability in the funds management industry. We conclude that, in practice, {{the difference between the}} amount paid for the pension and the present value of the pension income is huge - around 30 % of the amount paid for the pension. With most products, the funds-management industry takes clients' funds, invests to the best of its ability and charges fees for those management services. Risk is <b>borne</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>clients.</b> Lifetime indexed pensions are an exceptional product, where managers bear more aspects of risk. Naturally, there must be a payment or reward for bearing risk, but the size of that reward vis-a-vis the incidence of risk is open to question. More importantly the reward is, at present, substantially undisclosed. The next section of the paper describes lifetime indexed pensions and reports a small market survey conducted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> authors, while the next section reports the methodology used and analyses cash flows. The following section argues some possible rationalizations that may be proposed by financial institutions to justify the undisclosed 'fees' while the final section discusses policy issues and proposes minimal disclosure requirements...|$|R
40|$|Architecture, to be successful, {{has to be}} {{influential}} and relevant. It cannot thrive byitself, apart from the world. Resources are limited. Costs and benefits are not <b>borne</b> only <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>client.</b> <b>The</b> growing suburbia, based on standardised vulgarisation of styles of the past has become {{to be the most}} successful contemporary residential typology. Suburbia is not only prevalent, in its most vile form, in North America and,in a more amiable form, in Europe, but it’s threatening to attract the aspirational middle class in the overpopulated, thriving emerging economies. The ongoing transferof the office park, shopping mall and detached suburban house model is leading to construction of horrendously unliveable mega-non-cities like Jakarta or Kuala Lumpur. I believe architects should influence decision-makers on the search of alternatives tomake cities walkable, cyclable, connected, and efficient. These alternatives must lie beyond the mixture of naïveté and kitsch of the so-called New Urbanis...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{sites have}} long been {{accepted}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> public {{as one of the}} most hazardous workplaces. Despite the establishment and enactment of safety laws and regulations in the past decades, the industry still struggle to shed its poor safety image. However, the industry has been trying harder than ever to stop the rot in the last few years. Rather than passing the bucks to the Government, there is now a forceful drive <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>clients,</b> designers, contractors and sub-contractors to combine their efforts in order to reduce accidents on site. Gone are the days where the majority of safety issues and elements are expected to be <b>borne</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> contractors. <b>Client</b> organisations in particular, have shown more interest in improving safety records on their project sites. Traditionally, in order to avoid economic losses and legal entanglements resulting from injuries, they always shift the safety responsibilities to other parties. But now, they seem to have realised that they stand to lose more than they could bargain for if they steadfastly continue to play such a passive role in these safety issues. This study investigated <b>the</b> <b>client’s</b> role in construction safety. The relationship between project safety performance and <b>the</b> <b>client’s</b> influence was examined, with particular emphasis on the selection of safety-minded contractors, contractual safety requirements, and <b>the</b> <b>client’s</b> proactive involvement in safety management. It is concluded that <b>the</b> <b>client’s</b> involvement can significantly influence project safety performance. Clients can achieve better project safety performances by setting safety objectives, selecting safe contractors, and participating in safety management process during construction period.

40|$|M. Tech. Relative {{to other}} {{industries}} in South Africa and construction industries worldwide, the South African construction process generates {{a disproportionate number}} of fatalities, injuries and disease, the direct and indirect cost of which contribute to the cost of construction. Serious accidents and injuries resulting in personal injury and wrongful death occur with alarming frequency at construction sites in the U. K. The majority of accidents are not caused by careless workers but rather by failure to control. According to the Health and Safety Executive report published in 1988 out of the 90 % of all construction accidents leading to death 70 % could have been prevented by positive management actions and interventiion. Clients influence construction health and safety performance. Architects and design engineers often disavow responsibility for health and safety issues associated with the construction of their work. Arguably, this denial will only change if clients insist that construction health and safety is addressed on their projects. Health and safety begins with the attitude that accidents are preventable and that requirements for healthy and safe work practices must be followed. Health and safety should not be left solely {{under the control of the}} workers if injuries are to be curtailed or diminished, because the health and safety environment consists of many factors over which workers have little or no control. An underlying belief is that the majority of accidents are not caused by careless workers but by failure in controls. Although the best site management of health and safety cannot prevent all accidents, entities other than those actually performing the work do have an important role to play in enforcing proper safety standard measures : It is possible to prevent accidents from occurring. Success in health and safety has a great deal to do with people, especially those who will be responsible for ensuring that the project will be delivered safely. There is some evidence that the importance of health and safety is being realised by clients. Costs associated with worker injuries and fatalities are <b>borne</b> ultimately <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> and insisting that health and safety be included in design and construction considerations will prevent the occurrence of injuries and ultimately reduce <b>the</b> construction costs. <b>Clients</b> mostly set health and safety culture during the construction phase. Health and safety prequalification criteria to design approval post the design phase that shows that clients would prefer their involvement to be in specific phases. Clients do not realise that they can make significant contributions to improve health and safety performance during the early stages of a project. Clients who have to pay for construction work do not make specific cost provision for construction safety. Clients need to afford health and safety the same status as other project parameters. It is widely accepted that contractors should bear the responsibility for health and safety during the construction phase. The study found that <b>clients</b> regarded <b>the</b> construction and maintenance phases as the most important to address health and safety. Again clients do not realise the significance of placing health and safety importance in the initial phases of a project...|$|R
