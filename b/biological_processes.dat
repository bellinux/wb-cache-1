5|$|Biotechnology in {{the general}} sense has been an {{important}} part of biology since the late 19th century. With the industrialization of brewing and agriculture, chemists and biologists became aware of the great potential of human-controlled <b>biological</b> <b>processes.</b> In particular, fermentation proved a great boon to chemical industries. By the early 1970s, a wide range of biotechnologies were being developed, from drugs like penicillin and steroids to foods like Chlorella and single-cell protein to gasohol—as well as a wide range of hybrid high-yield crops and agricultural technologies, the basis for the Green Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and <b>biological</b> <b>processes</b> that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with {{a thick layer of}} plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Microarray {{technology}} enables large-scale inference of {{the participation}} of genes in <b>biological</b> <b>process</b> from similar expression profiles. Our aim is to induce classificatory models from expression data and biological knowledge that can automatically associate genes with novel hypotheses of <b>biological</b> <b>process.</b> Results: We report a systematic supervised learning approach to predicting <b>biological</b> <b>process</b> from time series of gene expression data and biological knowledge. Biological knowledge is expressed using gene ontology and this knowledge is associated with discriminatory expressionbased features to form minimal decision rules. The resulting rule model is first evaluated on genes coding for proteins with known <b>biological</b> <b>process</b> roles using cross validation. Then {{it is used to}} generate hypotheses for genes for which no knowledge of participation in <b>biological</b> <b>process</b> could be found. The theoretical foundation for the methodology based on rough sets is outlined in the paper, and its practical application demonstrated on a data set previously published by Cho et al. (Nat.

5|$|In 2002, Scottish {{toxicologist}} John Duffus {{reviewed the}} definitions used {{over the previous}} 60 years and concluded they were so diverse as to effectively render the term meaningless. Along with this finding, the heavy metal status of some metals is occasionally challenged {{on the grounds that}} they are too light, or are involved in <b>biological</b> <b>processes,</b> or rarely constitute environmental hazards. Examples include scandium (too light); vanadium to zinc (biological processes); and rhodium, indium, and osmium (too rare).|$|E
5|$|Observations of {{the surface}} have {{revealed}} {{that some of the}} molecular oxygen produced by radiolysis is not ejected from the surface. Because the surface may interact with the subsurface ocean (considering the geological discussion above), this molecular oxygen may make its way to the ocean, where it could aid in <b>biological</b> <b>processes.</b> One estimate suggests that, given the turnover rate inferred from the apparent ~0.5 Gyr maximum age of Europa's surface ice, subduction of radiolytically generated oxidizing species might well lead to oceanic free oxygen concentrations that are comparable to those in terrestrial deep oceans.|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{involved}} in numerous <b>biological</b> <b>processes.</b> It {{is the most important}} transition metal in all living organisms. Iron-proteins are found in all living organisms: archaeans, bacteria and eukaryotes, including humans. For example, the color of blood is due to hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. As illustrated by hemoglobin, iron is often bound to cofactors, such as hemes, which are non-protein compounds, often involving metal ions, that are required for a protein's biological activity to happen. The iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. The main roles of iron-containing proteins are the transport and storage of oxygen, as well as the transfer of electrons.|$|E

5|$|Like all lifeforms, new {{strains of}} E. coli evolve through the natural <b>biological</b> <b>processes</b> of mutation, gene duplication, and {{horizontal}} gene transfer; in particular, 18% {{of the genome}} of the laboratory strain MG1655 was horizontally acquired since the divergence from Salmonella. E. coli K-12 and E. coli B strains are {{the most frequently used}} varieties for laboratory purposes. Some strains develop traits that can be harmful to a host animal. These virulent strains typically cause a bout of diarrhea that is often self-limiting in healthy adults but is frequently lethal to children in the developing world. More virulent strains, such as , cause serious illness or death in the elderly, the very young, or the immunocompromised.|$|E
5|$|Protease {{inhibition}} by serpins controls {{an array}} of <b>biological</b> <b>processes,</b> including coagulation and inflammation, and consequently these proteins are the target of medical research. Their unique conformational change also makes them {{of interest to the}} structural biology and protein folding research communities. The conformational-change mechanism confers certain advantages, but it also has drawbacks: serpins are vulnerable to mutations that can result in serpinopathies such as protein misfolding and the formation of inactive long-chain polymers. Serpin polymerisation not only reduces the amount of active inhibitor, but also leads to accumulation of the polymers, causing cell death and organ failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary cause}} of lead's {{toxicity}} is its interference {{with a variety of}} enzymes because it binds to sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes. Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in <b>biological</b> <b>processes,</b> which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act. Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same enzymes as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. Among the essential metals with which lead interacts are calcium, iron, and zinc.|$|E

Each was defined in some detail, {{in some cases}} sufficient to enable modern biologists to create mathematical models of the mechanisms described. Aristotle's method, too, resembled the style of science used by modern biologists when exploring a new area, with systematic data collection, discovery of patterns, and inference of possible causal explanations from these. He did not perform experiments in the modern sense, but made observations of living animals and carried out dissections. He names some 500 species of bird, mammal, and fish; and he distinguishes dozens of insects and other invertebrates. He describes the internal anatomy of over a hundred animals, and dissected around 35 of these.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{has been}} shown to have at least three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many <b>biological</b> <b>processes,</b> including inflammation.|$|E

40|$|The Gene Ontology {{has been}} used {{extensively}} for measuring the functional similarity among genes of various organisms.
