He explained, [...] "Mikey was my best friend in the world and there's no Ministry without him. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> music we recorded together during the last weeks of his life had to be released to honor him. So after his funeral, I locked myself in my studio and turned the songs we had recorded into the best and last Ministry record anyone will ever hear. I can't do it without Mikey and I don't want to. So yes, this will be Ministry's last album." [...] The album, titled From Beer to Eternity, was released on September 6, 2013. Jourgensen stated that Ministry would tour in support of From Beer to Eternity, but would not record any more albums. In an April 2016 interview with Loudwire, however, Jourgensen mentioned the possibility of making another Ministry album [...] "if the circumstances are right." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> reprieve {{would be}} {{but for a}} short time, and though I {{had no wish to}} die, I must confess that I rather wished the ordeal over and the peace of {{oblivion}} upon me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} in Toronto, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> small towns near the Manitoba border best. In fact, I left an ambitious place called Gardner's Crossing about {{fourteen}} days ago." ...|$|E
60|$|I do pass {{by many of}} thy raging expressions, which I might justly charge {{with much}} unrighteousness; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> time is short, and then {{whatsoever}} thou has done in secret, shall be laid open upon the house tops, therefore I forbear them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] says my lord, as Lady Crabs swept by, [...] "I was {{in hopes}} she had forgiven you; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> whole story, and I must confess you used her cruelly ill. Two strings to your bow!--that was your game, was it, you rogue?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I didn't. I {{never saw}} her in my life before. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> old squire when I was a boy. However, I should have said friend. I went to see one friend, and I saw her." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> {{exactly where}} Joe Peel lived, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> part, and arter peeping into seven public-'ouses I {{see the man}} I wanted sitting by 'imself in a little bar. I walked in quiet-like, and sat down {{opposite}} 'im.|$|R
60|$|After landing we put {{our small}} luggage into a fly and were driven to an hotel in Calle Lima, an out-of-the-way place kept by a German; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> house to be a quiet, respectable one and very {{moderate}} in its charges.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{we thought}} alike of Miss Bingley," [...] replied Jane, [...] "your {{representation}} {{of all this}} might make me quite easy. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope {{in this case is}} that she is deceiving herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall see, sahib. I did {{not tell}} you all I knew lest we should fail to carry off the lady, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> orders that have been given.

6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Harriet, [...] "I haven't, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> {{symptoms}} {{and you certainly}} haven't got one of them. Whenever Harold isn't {{going to be up}} for dinner or for the evening you're always relieved. Possibly you don't realize it yourself, but you show it to any one who knows you." ...|$|E
60|$|It was pitch dark out there. I couldn't see a thing. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> {{man could}} not have gone far, or I should have heard him. I started to sniff round on the chance of picking up his trail. It wasn't long before I struck it.|$|R
60|$|I {{loved the}} dear old puss, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> moths would get her skin if I kept it, and {{preferred}} to rejoice {{the hearts of}} several small friends with dolls in full winter costume. I am sure Mrs. Bunch would have agreed with me, and not felt that I treated her remains with disrespect.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} glared upon me awhile, {{and then went}} on reading his paper. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> ways of those clerks. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was safe if he got through before another New York mail arrived. He only had two more papers left. After a while he {{finished}} them, and then he yawned and asked me what I wanted.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he requested, [...] "if {{you meet}} with strong opposition, {{come to me}} before you decide on any course, and I'll see what can be arranged. I dare say there'll be some trouble, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> trustees--and, as I said, {{there are people who}} must be saved all needless pain, at any cost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; {{not exactly}} among my own sheep; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> signs {{of it so}} well. My grasses are peculiarly dry, and my flocks are remarkably well looked after; but I can see {{indications}} of it. Only fancy where {{we should all be}} if fluke showed itself in Britannula! If it once got ahead we should be no better off than the Australians." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I did {{the usual}} stunt. Said: 'What's happened?' And 'Where am I?' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> {{answer to the}} last well enough. There's no moss growing on my brain. 'I think that'll do for the present, sister,' said the little man, and the nurse left the room {{in a sort of}} brisk well-trained way. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> caught her handing me out a look of deep curiosity as she passed through the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "As I am an unworthy priest," [...] {{said the}} father, [...] "I speak from {{the report of}} my own ears. Upon the oath of my order, myself heard this Wilkin Flammock chaffering with the Welshman for the {{surrender}} of the Garde Doloureuse. By help of this hauberk and mail hood, I gained admittance to a conference where he thought there were no English ears. They spoke Flemish too, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> jargon of old." ...|$|R
60|$|Shall I {{ever forget}} the rapid beating at my heart, occasioned {{by the look}} I met as I stood up!

"If I had not a deal of experience," [...] {{said the}} President at last, [...] "I should turn you off. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> world; and this much any way, {{that the most}} {{frivolous}} excuses for a suicide are often the toughest to stand by.

6000|$|... "The {{way they}} both {{made up to}} me was disgusting. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> girl is just a tool in her mother's hands. Her mother seemed {{actually}} passive in comparison. For skilful wheedling I could fall down and worship that woman; I really admire her. As long as the girl was with us she kept herself {{in the background and}} put the girl at me. It was simply a masterpiece." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hardly that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> family history, {{and they}} are a curious race with great {{capabilities}} for good or evil. It all depends upon how they are led, because nobody could drive a Thurston. It is rather, I must confess, an instinctive prejudice against the woman beside him.
