25|$|Generally, {{there are}} few reports about how many people disaffiliating from Islam in Muslim {{majority}} countries. The main {{reason for this is}} the social and legal repercussions associated with leaving Islam in many Muslim majority countries, up to and including the death penalty for apostasy. However, the report also suggest that in future, {{it is also possible that}} these societies could allow for greater freedom to religiously disaffiliate. On the other hand the increasingly large ex-Muslim communities in the Western world that adhere to no religion have been well documented. A 2007 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated, as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood. Equally, Darren E. Sherkat questioned in Foreign Affairs whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. Quantitative research is lacking, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification. Studies show that about half of the 4.2 million persons from Muslim background in Germany are no longer embrace Islam in adulthood. Many of the Muslims who leaves Islam faces social rejection or imprisonment and sometimes murder or penalty. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, there is increasing numbers of Americans who are leaving their faith and becoming unaffiliated and the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. According to Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans, the number of Iranian Americans Muslims decreased from 42% in 2008 to 31% in 2012. On the other hand, conversion into Islam have also been well documented.|$|E

500|$|Zhou {{can also}} be linked to these combat arts through his {{historical}} and folklore students. Practitioners of Eagle Claw, Chuojiao and Xingyi commonly include him within their lineage history because of his association with Yue Fei, the supposed progenitor of these styles. Yuen Mankai believes Zhou taught Lin Chong and Lu Junyi the [...] "same school" [...] of martial arts that was later combined with seventeen other schools to create Mantis fist. This combination of various schools refers to an eighteenth-century martial arts manual that describes the gathering of eighteen masters at the Shaolin Monastery that supposedly {{took place during the}} early years of the Song Dynasty. Lin Chong and Yan Qing are listed as two of the eighteen masters invited, which means their skills of Mandarin Duck Leg and ground fighting are treated as two separate schools, instead of one. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> Mantis fist was created during the Ming Dynasty, and was therefore influenced by these eighteen schools from the Song. He also says Lu Junyi taught Yan Qing the same martial arts as he learned from Zhou.|$|E

2500|$|Benjamin Libet's {{results are}} quoted {{in favor of}} epiphenomenalism, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> {{subjects}} still have a [...] "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In Freedom Evolves, Daniel Dennett argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. [...] Kornhuber & Deecke underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.|$|E

2500|$|Writing in 1941, and {{updating}} {{his argument}} in 1972, Shakespeare scholar Alfred Harbage proposed that [...] "curiously specific information" [...] about Guy Earl of Warwick's Philip Sparrow character {{pointed to a}} connection between the character and the real life of William Shakespeare. Sparrow hails from Stratford-on-Avon. [...] He got his girl there pregnant before leaving town (although in the real Shakespeare's case, he married her before leaving). [...] Sparrow describes himself as a [...] "high mounting lofty minded sparrow": Harbage thinks that the [...] "high mounting" [...] part of that phrase would simply be crowd-pleasing double entendre, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> the [...] "lofty minded" [...] part may represent [...] "a glancing hit at Shakespeare, written when his mounting star was vexing new writers as well as old." [...] Harbage concludes, [...] "On the other hand, it may not. Of one thing we may be certain: if Guy of Warwick had been published in 1592-1593 instead of misleadingly in 1661, the passage would by now have inspired volumes of commentary" [...] similar to the conjecture over the [...] "Upstart Crow" [...] passage in Robert Greene's Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit. John Berryman, writing in 1960 and building on Harbage's work, argues that because four parts of the attack against Shakespeare found in Groats-Worth - low birth, thievishness, arrogance, and a pun on Shakespeare's name - are also found in Guy Earl of Warwick, {{it seems likely that the}} writer of Guy Earl of Warwick was a purposeful imitator of Greene.|$|E
