The watershed is in the Western Middle Anthracite Coal Field.|$|E
5|$|Additional optical {{effects were}} {{provided}} by Visual Concept Engineering (VCE), a small effects company headed by Peter Kuran; Kuran had previously worked at ILM and left after finishing The Empire Strikes Back. VCE provided effects including phaser beams, the Enterprise reactor, additional sand on Ceti Alpha V, and an updated transporter effect. Meyer and the production staff were adamant about not using freeze frames for the transporter, as had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original television series. Scenes were shot so that conversations would continue while characters were in mid-transport, {{although much of the}} matte work VCE created was discarded when the production decided not to have as much action during transports.|$|E

5|$|During Oblivions development, Bethesda {{concentrated}} on creating {{a system with}} a more realistic storyline, believable characters, and meaningful quests than had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks {{to the use of}} Bethesda proprietary Radiant A.I. software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivions terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Nanticoke Creek {{is mainly}} forested, but urban land and mining land are also present. The city of Nanticoke is partially in the watershed and many unincorporated communities are there as well. The creek {{is named after}} the Nanticoke tribe, but was historically known as Muddy Run before appearing on maps with its present name by 1776. Extensive mining, both underground and on the surface, has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> creek's watershed. Numerous passive and active treatment systems have been installed in the watershed in recent times.|$|E
5|$|While Hawks was not {{sympathetic}} to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, a portrayal {{of women in}} more strong, less effeminate roles. Such an emphasis had never <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s and therefore was seen to be a rarity and, according to Naomi Wise, has been cited as a prototype of the post-feminist movement. Another notable theme carried throughout his work included the relationship of morality and human interaction. In this sense he tended to portray more dramatic elements of a concept or a plot in a humorous way.|$|E

5|$|A {{historic}} Native American path used to {{pass through}} the water gap of Leggetts Creek on its way from the headwaters of the Lehigh River to the Great Bend on the Susquehanna River near the Pennsylvania/New York border. Some mining and quarrying operations have <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed and the Leggetts Gap Railroad was built through Leggetts Gap in the 19th century. In the late 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries, numerous bridges were constructed across the creek. Wild trout naturally reproduce within the creek and several other species have been observed in its waters as well. Some reaches of the creek have a riparian buffer consisting of old growth forests. In other places, there are grasslands or invasive plants. A greenway/connecting trail along the creek was proposed in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan.|$|E
5|$|Arkwright's {{innovations}} {{were not}} confined to developing workers' settlements; he also had patents on many technologies used for water-powered spinning. They were so successful that rival industrialists risked legal action by copying his designs. His patents expired in 1785, and by 1788 over 200Arkwright type mills had been founded in Britain. New Lanark in Scotland– also a World Heritage Site– was directly influenced by Richard Arkwright and the developments in the Derwent Valley; Lanark {{was identified as a}} potential site for a mill on a visit by David Dale and Arkwright in 1784. Dale later established four mills at Lanark; they were structurally similar to Arkwright's Masson Mill and {{at least two of the}} mills used technology developed in the Derwent Valley, although the factory system was different from that used in the Derwent Valley. New Lanark was acquired by Robert Owen in 1799 who developed paternalism further than had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Derwent Valley, experimenting with education for young and old and social control. Saltaire– another World Heritage Site– was founded in 1853 and featured worker's housing and facilities, as well as other elements of the factory system developed by Arkwright.|$|E
5|$|In {{the domain}} of secular music, Josquin left {{numerous}} French chansons, for from three to six voices, {{as well as a}} handful of Italian secular songs known as frottole, as well as some pieces which were probably intended for instrumental performance. Problems of attribution are even more acute with the chansons than they are with other portions of his output: while about 70 three and four-voice chansons were published under his name during his lifetime, only six of the more than thirty five- and six-voice chansons attributed to him were circulated under his name during the same time. Many of the attributions added after his death are considered to be unreliable, and much work has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last decades of the 20th century to correct attributions on stylistic grounds.|$|E

5|$|Mining has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solomon Creek {{watershed}} in the past, causing considerable environmental damage. The mining {{began in}} the beginning of the 1800s and continued until the 1970s. However, there was one strip mining permit in the watershed in the late 1990s. Starting in 1967, the mine pools under the creek stopped having water pumped out of them. This led to them flooding and damaging buildings in the watershed in 1972 during Hurricane Agnes. To remedy the problem of the flooding, the Buttonwood Tunnel and three boreholes known as the South Wilkes-Barre Boreholes were created. The water quality of the creek was assessed in 1970 as part of Operation Scarlift. A 1977 study by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed brook trout inhabiting the watershed, although the stream was listed as impaired on account of the mining. A plan called the Solomon Creek Cold Water Conservation Plan was initiated in the summer of 2011 and continued into 2012.|$|E
5|$|Much of Livingstone's {{first two}} years were devoted to setting up the Mayoral system and administration. He also devoted much time to battling New Labour's plans to upgrade the London Underground system through a public–private {{partnership}} (PPP) program, believing it to be too expensive and tantamount to the privatisation of a state-owned service. He furthermore had strong concerns about safety; PPP would divide {{different parts of the}} Underground among various companies, something that he argued threatened a holistic safety and maintenance program. These concerns were shared by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) trade union, who went on strike over the issue, being joined on the picket line by Livingstone. Appointing Bob Kiley as transport commissioner, the duo argued that the upgrade should be carried out in state hands through a public bond issue, as had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of the New York City Subway. They launched court cases against the government over PPP in 2001–02, but were ultimately unsuccessful, and the project went ahead, with the Underground being privatised in January 2003.|$|E
5|$|When Kitase was put {{in charge}} of Final Fantasy VII, he and Nomura entirely {{reworked}} the initial plot. Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima joined the team after he had finished his work on Bahamut Lagoon. While Final Fantasy VI adopted a style of making all playable characters equally important, the team soon decided that they needed a central protagonist for Final Fantasy VII. The pursuit of Sephiroth that made up {{a large part of the}} main narrative was suggested by Nomura, as it had not <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series before. Kitase and Nojima conceived AVALANCHE and Shinra as opposing organizations, and created Cloud's backstory as well as his relationship to Sephiroth. Among Nojima's biggest contributions to the plot were Cloud's memories and split personality; this included the eventual conclusion involving his newly created character of Zack. The crew helped Kitase adjust the specifics of Sakaguchi's original Lifestream concept.|$|E
