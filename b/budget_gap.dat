Long before the deadline date, Corzine had stated {{that he would not}} accept a budget that did not include a sales tax increase. Due to Corzine's insistence, the state's General Assembly, which was dominated by Democrats, refused to pass a budget before the deadline.|$|E

40|$|Across the nation, large <b>budget</b> <b>gaps</b> {{are forcing}} state governments to make tough policy choices. While {{some states are}} trying to control spending, others are turning to tax {{increases}} to balance their budgets. Some state {{officials are trying to}} pass the buck for their poor fiscal management by pleading for a bailout from Washington. But a bailout would encourage states to continue overspending, which {{is the source of the}} current fiscal mess. The states' mistake was to allow rapid tax revenue growth during the 1990 s to fuel an unsustainable expansion in spending. Between fiscal years 1990 and 2001, state tax revenue grew 86 percent [...] more than the 55 percent of inflation plus population growth. If states had limited spending growth to that benchmark, budgets would have been $ 93 billion smaller by FY 01 [...] representing savings roughly twice the size of today's state <b>budget</b> <b>gaps.</b> If revenue growth higher than the benchmark had been given back to taxpayers in permanent tax cuts and annual rebates, rebates could have been temporarily suspended during FY 02 and FY 03 to provide a cushion with which to balance state <b>budgets.</b> Current <b>budget</b> <b>gaps</b> provide policymakers an opportunity to weed out the budget excesses built up during the past decade. Yet overall state spending continues to grow. After soaring 8. 0 percent in FY 01, state general fund spending has not been cut in FY 02 or FY 03 even as large <b>budget</b> <b>gaps</b> have appeared. States should impose tax and spending growth caps to prevent budgets from growing too quickly during the next boom. Revenue growth above a benchmark would be given back in tax cuts and tax rebates. That would prevent spending from increasing too quickly and provide the option of suspending rebates during slowdowns to close <b>budget</b> <b>gaps</b> without the damage caused by tax rate increases...|$|R
