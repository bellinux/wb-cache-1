Mr. Gerlach also opposes the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have amended the constitution to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman. In 2007, however, Gerlach voted against {{a bill that would have}} repealed [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." [...] In 2010, Gerlach also voted against the “2010-2011 Defense Appropriations Act,” which would have included a repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” after military certification and review. Gerlach defended this vote, saying, “Voting on this issue six months before Defense Secretary Robert Gates is scheduled to issue a thorough review of the policy and how best to implement any changes does nothing to improve the security of our country or the morale of the <b>brave</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> serving in our military." [...] In 2007-2008, Gerlach received a 64 percent support rating from the Family Research Council, an interest group whose mission statement commits it to being an organization that “shapes public debate and formulates public policy that values human life and upholds the institutions of marriage and the family.” ...|$|E

They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them." [...] In a blog post the next day, Moulitsas defended and clarified his remarks:"My language was harsh, and, in reality, not true. Fact is, I did feel something. That's why I was so angry. I was angry that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts. I was angry that 51 American soldiers paid the ultimate price for Bush's folly in Iraq in March alone. I was angry that these mercenaries make more in a day than our <b>brave</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> in uniform make in an entire month. I was angry that the US is funding private armies, paying them $30,000 per soldier, per month, while the Bush administration tries to cut our soldiers' hazard pay.

2500|$|For {{the first}} half of the deployment, 3rd BSTB focused {{squarely}} upon the non-security lines of operation. [...] Charged with partnering with the Czech Republic Provincial Reconstruction Team and the Afghan provincial leadership, 3rd BSTB reorganized its staff to attack issues along the lines of infrastructure, economic, and governance development. [...] However, in May 2009, 3rd BCT reorganized combat power within AO Spartan, giving 3rd BSTB security responsibility for the four northern districts of Logar Province, in addition to the development responsibility for the entire province. [...] Soldiers from all three line companies served as infantry combat Soldiers, given manpower shortages and mission requirements. [...] At the height of the deployment, immediately prior to the Afghan National Elections of August 2009, the 3rd BSTB consisted of over 700 Soldiers; during that time, these extraordinary men and women could be found conducting combat patrols, pulling security at far-flung outposts, conducting offensive combat operations, clearing routes of IEDs and promoting increased economic and governance development throughout the province, all regardless of MOS. [...] The 3rd BSTB had arguably one of the most successful deployments of any Special Troops Battalion within the history of the Army. [...] A testament to this fact was the ever-increasing and ever-changing mission set that was met with little argument, but rather, a can-do effort that is more than anything a portrait of the <b>brave</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> who comprise the 3rd BSTB.

Introduction: The {{history of}} the Women of Kansas is so {{interwoven}} with the {{history of the}} state that {{it is almost impossible to}} tell their story without giving a part as the whole of the history of Kansas. It would take the inspiration of a poet, the eloquence of an orator, and the genius of a writer, to do justice to their sterling worth, their ambition and their endurance. Characters were developed, grand and noble, which exerted their influence in the years that followed, they deprived themselves of the comforts of life, and deemed no sacrifice too great which gave them the opportunity of educating their children. In the state today no truer, <b>braver</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> ever lived, <b>and</b> it is this kind who has made an impress upon Kansas and her institutions. What Kansas is today, she owes to the foundations laid by her brave pioneers. Kansas has an eager restless spirit and her people are ever progressing. This spirit is manifested in the service of women as county superintendents, regents and professors of colleges, organizers of clubs in literary and art circles, in the industrial world and in almost every other line which could be mentioned...|$|R

In such society all other aims seemed poor and petty; for they appeared to live in a nobler world than any she had known, and she felt as if they belonged to another race; not men nor angels, but a delightful mixture of the two; more as she imagined the gods and heroes of old; not perfect, but wonderfully strong and brave and good; each gifted with a separate virtue, and each bent on a mission that should benefit mankind.|$|R
