5000|$|Returning {{in time to}} 1920, Slater {{had gone}} to Harvard {{to work for a}} Ph.D. with Percy Bridgman, who studied the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> under very high pressures. Slater {{measured}} the compressibility of common salt and ten other alkali halides—compounds of lithium, sodium, potassium and rubidium, with fluorine, chlorine and bromine. He described the results as [...] "exactly in accord with Bohr's recent views of the relation between electron structure and the periodic table". This brought Slater's observation concerning the mechanical properties of ionic crystals into line with the theory that Bohr had based on the spectroscopy of gaseous elements. He wrote the alkali halide paper in 1923, having [...] "by the summer of 1922" [...] been [...] "thoroughly indoctrinated ... with quantum theory", in part by the courses of Edwin Kemble following a fascination with Bohr's work during his undergraduate days. In 1924, Slater went to Europe on a Harvard Sheldon Fellowship. After a brief stay at the University of Cambridge, he went on to the University of Copenhagen, where [...] "he explained to Bohr and Kramers his idea (that was) a sort of forerunner of the duality principle, (hence) the celebrated paper" [...] on the work that others dubbed the Bohr-Kramers-Slater (BKS) theory. [...] "Slater suddenly became an internationally known name.". Interest in this [...] "old-quantum-theory" [...] paper subsided with the arrival of full quantum mechanics, but Philp M. Morse's biography states that [...] "in recent years it has been recognized that the correct ideas in the article are those of Slater." [...] Slater discusses his early life through the trip to Europe in a transcribed interview.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (lca) is a method allocating {{the environmental impacts of}} the whole life cycle of a product to the functioning of that product. The scientific basis of the method is still being elaborated. In this paper a proposal is made to improve the scientific basis of one specific step of the methods: the aggregation of potentially toxic emissions of substances in one score for human toxicity and two scores for ecotoxicity. The aggregation is based on multimedia environmental models of Mackay simulating the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> in the environment, and on toxicity data such as acceptable resp. tolerable daily intake (adi resp. tdi) and no observed effect concentration (noec) per substance. It is proposed to apply models describing the environmental fate of toxic substances in lcas of products.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{rapid and}} uniform {{establishment}} of rice crops {{is important for}} improving production. However, this condition is influenced by several factors, including the soil temperature when planting, which may delay seed germination and compromise the final stand. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> which have the effect of growth regulator when applied to the seeds of different rice cultivars under low-temperature conditions. The experiment was carried out in a completely randomised design with four replications in a bi-factorial scheme, where factor A was represented by the different products (gibberellic acid - AG 3, tiamethoxam - TMX, Haf Plus® - HAF, and a control with water - TEST), and factor B by the irrigated rice cultivars (IRGA 424, IRGA 425, Puitá INTA CL, and Avaxi CL). In addition, the experiment was repeated at temperatures of 17 °C and 25 °C in order to simulate low-temperature conditions. The results showed that AG 3 is effective in increasing seed vigour in the rice cultivars at both temperatures, with the AG 3, TMX and HAF responsible for increasing germination percentage only at the temperature of 17 °C. The effect of the products is more pronounced at low temperatures, and is dependent on the cultivar; in cultivars which are sensitive to cold there is no effect from the products used...|$|E

40|$|Emission of pollutants, {{followed}} by their atmospheric transport and deposition, {{is one of}} the various routes which lead to exposure of man and the environment. Ambient concentration levels and deposition loads can be predicted by the use of atmospheric transport models. However, such models require knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of the emitted compounds. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe procedures which estimate these properties for organic compounds. The discussion of the procedures is structured according to the input requirements of the OPS model. This model, developed by RIVM, predicts the atmospheric <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> on the basis of a few compound- specific parameters. These parameters can be derived from the vapour pressure, the Henry coefficient and the reactivity of the substance. This report indicates the data bases and literature sources which present relevant information on organic compounds. Furthermore, for those cases where the necessary information is not available, calculation methods are indicated which may support the derivation of compound-specific parameters. The project cluster "Evaluation System for New Substances" (BNS) aims to develop systematic methods to support risk assessment of the production and use of new chemicals. The OPS model, combined with the procedures outlined in this report, may be one of the tools to assess the risks which are related to atmospheric transport of pollutants. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} the 2006 proposal for the risk assessment of persistence of plant protection products in soil. The proposal considered three protection goals and proposed tiered assessment and decision schemes for each protection goal. The three schemes appeared to be consistent, both internally and with each other. It was found that both pore water concentrations and total content have to be considered in the soil risk assessment. The evaluation has been performed for five substances with all available information from both registration dossiers and open literature. Nevertheless, insufficient information was available to evaluate all aspects of the proposal. In practice this means that pesticide industry has to provide additional information for many dossiers. Furthermore, it was found that existing information often needs to be re-interpreted and a need for standardisation of evaluation of terrestrial (semi-) field experiments was observed. The proposal would require specific expertise and investments of evaluating authorities as well as stakeholders. To better understand fate and effects of persistent substances, it is recommended to investigate the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> in the field over longer periods, to perform exposure concentration measurements while performing ecotoxicological tests, to develop protocols for testing effects on fungi, and to gain the necessary experience on the conduct and interpretation of (semi-) field studies with respect to the relation between exposure and effects of plant protection products...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is based on}} the summary of the GESAMP report to UNEP on mercury in the aquatic environment. The summary is divided into three main sections: Sources and releases, aquatic and oceanic transport and assessment of monitoring and evaluation. Sources can be natural or anthropogenic in origin with both diffuse and point sources being considered. While point sources are the most direct entry into an aquatic system, atmospheric deposition is the dominant input component to the world oceans. Consequently, reduction of mercury emissions must be the dominant mechanism of control. Wet deposition is a primary mechanism for transporting mercury from the atmosphere to surface water and land. Once in aquatic systems, it can exist in dissolved or particulate forms and can undergo a number of chemical transformations. Contaminated sediments at the bottom of surface waters serves as a mercury reservoir with sediment-bound mercury, recycling back into the aquatic ecosystem for decades or longer. Mercury has a long retention time in soils, so mercury that has accumulated in soils may continue to be released to surface waters and other media for long periods. Methylmercury (CH 3 Hg+) is {{the most common form of}} organic mercury in the environment and is more toxic than elemental or inorganic mercury with the potential for bioconcentration and bioaccumulation via the aquatic food web. This places people, all over the world, who consume predatory fish (or where fish is a dietary staple) at risk. The methylation of mercury occurs by biotic and abiotic processes, and transformation processes are influenced by several environmental factors such as pH, temperature, sulphate deposition, and availability of biodegradable organic carbon. Currently there are 2 main ways to evaluate concentrations of mercury in the environment based on principles of modelling or measuring techniques. Modelling programs have been studied to better understand the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> in environmental media and used to estimate for mercury and its compounds in various environmental compartments.

40|$|The {{action of}} organic {{compounds}} as inhibitors of corrosion of metals has been explained in various ways. It {{has been suggested}} that the inhibition increases with increasing size and molecular weight. Another view that has been put forward is that the organic substances increase the hydrogen overvoltage at the cathodic sites and thereby bring down corrosion. It has been postulated that the corrosion inhibitors get adsorbed on the cathodic sites. However, it has subsequently been demonstrated that they get adsorbed on the anodic sites also. The formation of films of the compound formed by the inhibitors with the metal surface has also been put up as the cause of corrosion inhibition. Recently, {{attempts have been made to}} explain the adsorption of inhibitors in terms of the functionally reactive groups amine and sulphide and the effects of various attached groups on the functional groups. In addition, the role of conjugated double bond in promoting adsorption by bi-bonding of the organic molecule with the metal surface has been emphasized. Another approach has been to interpret the adsorption of corrosion inhibitors on the basis of charge on the metal surface. In view of reports that the electro capillary <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> bears a close correlation to their corrosion inhibitive properties, a study has been made of five organic sulphur compounds, viz. dimethyl sulphide, dimethyl sulphoxide, dibutyl sulphide, diphenyl sulphide and thiophene to test the validity of the interpretations of the action of organic compounds with respect to adsorption as how by their electrocapillary behaviour on mercury and their effectiveness in the inhibition of corrosion of steel in 1 N sulphuric acid. A radio-tracer investigation of the adsorption of dibutyl sulphide containing radioactive sulphur has also been included in the study. It has been found that there is relationship between the electrocapillary behaviour on mercury and corrosion inhibition of steel only in the case of some substances. The concept of adsorption increasing with decrease in solubility of organic compounds is not completely borne out. Dimethyl sulphide is adsorbed to a greater extent and is more corrosion inhibitive than dibutyl sulphide in spite of the former’s higher solubility in the acid solution. However, dimethyl sulphoxide which is freely misible with the acid solution is much less adsorbed and corrosion inhibitive than either dimethyl sulphide or dibutyl sulphide. Incidentally, it has been observed that dibutyl sulphide containing radioactive sulphur accelerates the corrosion of steel in 1 N sulphuric acid at concentrations of the compound less than full saturation. Then, aromatic rings are directly linked to sulphur as in dibutyl sulphide, the adsorption on mercury is of a low order and the corrosion inhibitive effect is not high. In the case of thiophene, though adsorption on mercury surface is indicated by its electrocapillary behaviour, it is very poor as inhibitor of corrosion of steel in sulphuric acid. In both these compounds, the effectiveness of the sulphur atom is brought down, because of resonance of the electrons of sulphur with those of the aromatic ring. It is concluded that various aspects of adsorption and interactions between the organic compound and the metal surface, between the solute and the solvent and between the functional group and the attached groups of the compound itself have to be taken into account in attempting to explain the adsorption behaviour and corrosion inhibitive properties of organic corrosion inhibitors. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{contribution}} {{to the development of a}} specific method to assess the presence of residues in agricultural commodities. The following objectives are formulated: to identify and describe main processes in environment — plant exchanges, to build of a model to assess the residue concentration at harvest in agricultural commodities, to understand the functioning of the modelled system, to characterise pesticides used in field crops and identify optimisation potentials in phytosanitary measures. The frame for the methodological developments corresponds to the procedure for the evaluation of the toxicity provided for the Life Cycle Impact Assessment methodology and for the method Impact 2002 +. In chapter 2, the methodological procedure for the assessment of human toxicity potential is introduced. First the factors of fate and exposure are described, including the notion of harvest fraction, the amount of substance found in harvest per unit of substance emitted initially in the system, the main result of the present study. Then the effect factors and the framework for impact evaluation are introduced. Chapter 3 describes the principles accounted for the building of the fate model. Wheat crop and a restricted list of substances are chosen for these methodological developments. The model is composed by compartments describing the environment and the plant. Its functioning is based on initial amounts of substance in the source compartments, on transfer rates linking the compartments and on a dynamic evolution as a function of time between the treatment and the harvest. Air, soil and formulation deposit on plant are the primer compartments receiving the treated substance. Each transport is described by a transfer rate accounting for the process and for the equilibrium partitioning between the two exchanging compartments. Degradation of substance and plant growth are additional processes considered. Each compartment is described by a linear differential equation for the variation of mass accumulating and dissipating. Their assembly builds the model solved as a function of time. This exact resolution is complemented by additional tools to better understand the system functioning and to provide further approximations of the results: the system is simplified into subsystems describing the source and the receiving plant compartment and analytically solved using interpretable equations. Chapter 4 describes and discusses all transport and dissipation processes determining the fate of the substance in the limits of the system. The recent publications concerning the understanding and the modelling of pesticide transfer from formulation deposit on plant through the cuticular membranes give new possibilities to model pesticide fate and to better account for the direct applications on the plant. In chapter 5, the core model is first applied and its functioning analysed. The low availability and partly unsatisfying quality of data for pesticides description is a main complication for the methodology application: the lack of data for the half-life of the substance in the plant especially leads to a strong extrapolation for this determinant factor. A large difference is observed between early and late applied pesticides with respectively a major release to soil or a release to formulation deposit on plant surface. The initial transport processes quickly distribute the substance in the system. Once each plant compartment has accumulated residues up to a maximum amount, a dissipation phase occurs. The duration of these periods is determinant for the level of residue in harvest. The soil is a determinant source for long term evolutions of the system, for soon applied substances with low degradation rate. The half-life of substance deposited on plant is equal to a few days, but the transfer is fast from formulation deposit to the inner plant, where degradation is generally much slower. The accumulation of substance from the air is mostly negligible. The sum of the subsystems gives an approximation of the total system, useful for interpretation. The possibility to simplify the subsystem by ignoring the transfer back from receiving to the source compartment underlines the low contribution of these transfers in the functioning of the model. An approximated resolution is based on the determination of the maximum accumulated substance and on the subsequent dissipation process. However, an important loss of precision is observed. This approximation is useful for interpretation and for extrapolations. In chapter 6, an evaluation of the model is conducted through a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. The sensitivity analysis consists of evaluating the effect on the output of a change in an input, on the basis of three complementary approaches: the effect of a fixed change in the input of e. g. 0. 1 %, the effect of a change specific to the uncertainty of the input and the effect of a change in input value from a minimum to a maximum. The uncertainty of an output is evaluated according to the relative contribution of the confidence factors of the inputs. Results show that the half-lives and the time are the most important factors determining the sensitivity of the system and the propagation of uncertainty. The contribution of the half-life to the confidence factor of the harvest fraction reaches between 30 % to 98 % of the total uncertainty. The confidence factors of results increase exponentially with the time interval between application and harvest. The role of partition coefficients to the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> is highly variable, may be determinant or negligible, with increasing or limiting effect on mobility. Sensitivity and uncertainty for parameters describing the agricultural or environmental system are very variable, but sometimes determinant and so confirmed as essential for the system functioning. Consequently, differences in harvest fractions between substances are only significant if they are high. A first comparison of the computed results with measures of residues obtained by an experiment and with references such as tolerance values lead to a pertinent verification of the overall methodology. Finally, the qualitative comparison with other models underlines the specificities and the originality of the present methodology in particular by comparison with environmental multi-media models running in steady state. In chapter 7, the model is finally applied for an ultimate interpretation. The harvest fractions for more than 100 substances are evaluated. Among all types of substances, low and high levels of residues per treatment are found, representative for the high variability of harvest fractions from 5 E- 16 for bromoxynil to 7 E- 03 for tebuconazole sprayed on wheat. The fate process represents the highest source of variation for the toxicity. If the application rate does not explain the high differences in residue level at harvest, the time of application may represent an optimisation potential particularly for late treatments. However, the toxicity needs to account for both fate and effect factors, as only their combination effectively allows to evaluate the toxicity. According to the available list of Human Damage Factors per treatment, problematic substances may be effectively identified and substituted. In chapter 8 answers to questions brought with the objectives bring a conclusion to the study. The appendices include notably the results of harvest fractions and toxicity per unit substance applied, per treatment and per unit cultivated crop area, for the main substances and field crops.

Les objectifs suivants sont formulés: identifier et décrire les principaux processus d’échanges entre l'environnement et la plante, créer un modèle pour évaluer la concentration en résidus au moment de la récolte, comprendre le fonctionnement du système modélisé, caractériser les pesticides utilisés dans les grandes cultures et identifier les potentiels d'optimisation dans la lutte phytosanitaire. Le cadre de ces développements correspond à la procédure d'évaluation de la toxicité de la méthode de l'Analyse du Cycle de Vie et de la méthode Impact 2002 +. Dans le chapitre 2, la procédure méthodologique pour l'évaluation du potentiel de toxicité humaine est introduite. D'abord, les facteurs de devenir et d'exposition sont décrits, incluant la notion de fraction récoltée, la quantité de substance trouvée dans les récoltes par unité de substance émise initialement dans le système, le principal résultat de cette étude. Ensuite, les facteurs d'effet et le cadre de l'évaluation de l'impact sont introduits. Le chapitre 3 décrit les principes considérés pour la création du modèle. La culture du blé et une liste réduite de substances sont choisis pour les développements méthodologiques. Le modèle est composé de compartiments décrivant l’environnement et la plante. Son fonctionnement se base sur les quantités initiales de substance dans les compartiments sources, sur les taux de transfert reliant des compartiments et sur une évolution dynamique en fonction du temps entre le traitement et la récolte. L'air, le sol et le dépôt de substance sur la plante sont les compartiments primaires recevant la substance traitée. Chaque transport est décrit par un taux de transfert comprenant le processus et l'équilibre de partition entre les deux compartiments d'échange. La dégradation de la substance et la croissance de la plante sont des processus supplémentaires considérés. Chaque compartiment est décrit par une équation différentielle linéaire pour la variation de masse accumulée et dissipée. Leur assemblage compose le modèle, résolu en fonction du temps. Cette résolution exacte est complétée d'outils additionnels pour mieux comprendre le fonctionnement du système et fournir des approximations supplémentaires des résultats: le système est simplifié en sous-systèmes décrivant la source et le compartiment plante, et est résolu par des équations interprétables. Le chapitre 4 décrit et discute tous les processus de transport et de dissipation déterminant le devenir de la substance dans les limites du système. Les publications récentes concernant la compréhension et la modélisation du transfert de pesticides depuis les produits déposés sur la plante à travers les membranes cuticulaires donnent de nouvelles possibilités de modéliser le devenir des pesticides et de mieux considérer les applications directes sur la plante. Dans le chapitre 5, le modèle est d'abord appliqué et son fonctionnement est analysé. La faible disponibilité et la qualité partiellement insatisfaisante des données pour la description des pesticides constitue la principale complication dans l'application du modèle : l'absence de données pour la demi-vie des substances dans la plante conduit en particulier à une extrapolation forte pour ce facteur déterminant. Une différence importante est observée entre les pesticides appliqués précocement ou tardivement, respectivement entre un apport majeur vers le sol ou un apport majeur vers la surface de la plante. Les processus initiaux de transports distribuent rapidement la substance dans le système. Après que chaque compartiment eut accumulé une quantité maximale de résidus, une phase de dissipation survient. La durée de ces périodes est déterminante pour le niveau de résidus. Le sol est une source déterminante pour des évolutions de longue durée et pour des substances avec une faible dégradation. La demi-vie d'une substance déposée sur la plante est égale à quelques jours, mais le taux de transfert est rapide vers l'intérieur de la plante, où la dégradation est plus lente. Les contributions depuis l'air sont la plupart du temps négligeables. La somme des sous-systèmes donne une approximation du système utile pour l'interprétation. La possibilité de simplifier le système en ignorant le transfert de retour vers la source souligne la faible contribution de ces transferts dans le fonctionnement du modèle. Une résolution approximative est basée sur la détermination de la quantité maximale de substance accumulée et sur sa dissipation subséquente. Toutefois une perte importante de précision peut être observée. Cette approximation est utile pour l'interprétation ou pour certaines extrapolations. Le chapitre 6 comprend une évaluation du modèle. L’analyse de sensibilité consiste à évaluer l’effet du changement d’un paramètre sur le résultat, selon trois approches: l’effet d’un changement fixe par exemple de 0, 1 %, l’effet d’un changement spécifique à l’incertitude du paramètre, et l’effet d’un changement considérant les valeurs minimales et maximales du paramètre. L’incertitude du résultat est évaluée sur la base de l{{a contribution}} relative des facteurs de confiance des paramètres. Les résultats montrent que les demi-vies et le temps sont les facteurs les plus importants déterminant la sensibilité du système et la propagation de l'incertitude. La contribution de la demi-vie au facteur de confiance de la fraction récoltée atteint entre 305 et 98 % du total de l’incertitude. Les facteurs de confiance des résultats augmentent de façon exponentielle avec l’intervalle entre le traitement et la récolte. Le rôle des facteurs de partition dans le comportement des substances est très variable, peut être déterminant ou négligeable, avec un effet croissant ou limitant sur la mobilité. La sensibilité et l'incertitude des paramètres décrivant le système environnemental ou agricole sont très variables, parfois déterminants, et ainsi confirmés comme essentiels au fonctionnement du système. Par conséquent, seules de larges différences de fractions récoltées entre substances sont significatives. Une première comparaison des résultats modélisés avec des mesures de résidus obtenues par une expérimentation et avec des références comme les valeurs de tolérance conduisent à une vérification pertinente de la méthodologie. Finalement, la comparaison qualitative avec d'autres modèles souligne la spécificité et l'originalité de la présente méthodologie, en particulier par la comparaison avec des modèles environnementaux multi-media évoluant en état stationnaire. Dans le chapitre 7, le modèle est finalement appliqué pour une ultime interprétation. L'évaluation porte sur une plus large série de substances. Les fractions récoltées pour plus de 100 substances sont évaluées. Parmi tous les types de substances, des niveaux bas et élevés de résidus par traitement sont trouvés, représentatifs de la variabilité des fractions récoltées, de 5 E- 16 pour le bromoxynil à 7 E- 03 pour le tébuconazole utilisés sur le blé. Le processus de devenir représente la source la plus élevée de variation pour l'évaluation de la toxicité. Si la dose de traitement n'explique pas les larges différences de résidus à la récolte, le moment du traitement peut représenter un potentiel d'optimisation, en particulier pour les traitements tardifs. Toutefois, l'évaluation de la toxicité doit prendre en compte les deux facteurs, puisque seule leur combinaison permet effectivement d'évaluer la toxicité. Sur la base de la liste actuellement disponible des facteurs de dommages sur l'humain, les substances problématiques peuvent être identifiées et substituées. Dans le chapitre 8, les réponses aux défis et questions soulevées avec les objectifs apportent une conclusion à l'étude. Les annexes de l'étude comprennent notamment les résultats des fractions récoltées, des résultats de toxicité par kg appliqué, par traitement, par unité de surface cultivée, pour les principales substances et grandes cultures. Une analyse de cycle de vie est également présentée pour le niveau d'intensité de production du blé...|$|E

40|$|The {{undesired}} {{formation of}} decomposition {{products in the}} accidental scenarios that involve the release of chemicals is a core issue in process safety assessment. The secondary substances may be {{much different from the}} original ones and, in particular, more dangerous for humans or for the ecosystem. Nevertheless, no robust and widely accepted method exists for the assessment of this kind of hazards. In the present study, an approach to the assessment of this hazard was developed in the more general framework of the analysis of the inherent safety of chemical processes. The toxicological, physical and chemical parameters mostly influencing the hazardous <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> a released <b>substance</b> are identified by specific environmental fate models and used in the evaluation of hazard footprints. From these data, hazard indexes are determined, that express in a quantitative way the overall <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> a <b>substance</b> with respect to specific categories of hazards (acute toxicity, chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity for humans, ecotoxicity). This allows a comprehensive representation of the hazard profile <b>of</b> a <b>substance.</b> Since the data used for the evaluation of the different parameters are usually scant, a simplified estimation procedure was developed, based on the identification of structure-activity relationships. The application of the described approach to several case studies confirmed the effectiveness of the tool for the comparison of the hazards derived by undesired substance decomposition in accidental scenarios...|$|R

Paolo, cv. Polaris and cv. Sandek) or with the organic acids (succinic and fumaric) present in the exudates and followed the change in molecular size distribution. Succinic acid, Polaris and Sandek exudates shifted the humic absorbance from high to low molecular weight in size exclusion chromatogram,s while Paolo exudates {{were not able to}} produce the same shift and gave an absorbance profile like that <b>of</b> humic <b>substance</b> alone. Our results are evidence <b>of</b> the micellar <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> humic <b>substances</b> in solution and of the importance of hydrophobic bonds in holding humic molecular together. Exudates were also used to separate soil organic fractions from the same soil. Soil organic extracts were characterized by low pressure gel permeation chromatography, hormone-like activities, and ‘H-NMR. The data, compared with water extract and KOH extract, indicate that maize exudates, fumaric and succinic acids mobilize soil organic fractions in small quantities, but these extracts are endowed with auxin- and/or gibberellin-like activity. Water extract and maize exudates exhibit no hormone-like activity, while KOH extract shows a negligible one. Moreover, only Polaris and Sandek exudates and succinic acid are able to disaggregate an organic fraction with low apparent molecular size (< 13 KDs) from the bulk of the soil. The ‘H-NMR data indicate that water and succinic extracts are largely composed of carbohydrate and aliphatic constituents, Sandek exudate and fitmaric acid can liberate aromatic components, Polaris exudate releases carbohydrates from soil, while Paolo slightly influences the aliphatic constituents. The role of organic acids released by maize seedlings in mobilising soil organic fractions is presented...|$|R

The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effect <b>of</b> a <b>substance</b> abuse primary prevention programme and ascertain its influence on three variables namely; attitude <b>behaviour</b> and knowledge <b>of</b> grade eight learners. The literature review revealed that there is a possibility that substance abuse awareness talk changes the <b>behaviour</b> and attitude <b>of</b> learners thus improving their knowledge about substance abuse effects. Whereas the United Nations indicated that for the success of the prevention programme it should be coupled with life skills. It was also revealed in the literature that the evaluation of prevention programmes was rarely done in South Africa due to lack of funding. The Elim Clinic as the organisation that deals with substance abuse treatment and prevention maintains that prevention is better than cure, therefore, all young people must be exposed to their substance abuse awareness talks. Peer educators of the secondary school presented the programme for grade 8 learners. A sample of thirty grade eight learners was systematically selected for this study in one of the secondary schools at Tembisa. The data were collected by means a of questionnaire based on background information of respondents, attitude, knowledge and <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> abuse. Due to the quantitative approach employed the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was utilized to determine the difference between the pre-test and post-test results. The findings of the study clarified that the program had an effect on knowledge and no statistical significance on attitude and behaviour. It was concluded, too, that information given to young people cannot determine change in behaviour and attitude, and increasing their knowledge does not mean they will not abuse substances in the future.

The substances used were: hydroquinone and 1, 4 -benzoquinone. In order to identify situations that can lead to a runaway reaction, an Early Warning Detection System (EWDS) has been used. The detection criterion for runaway is based on the calculation of the divergence of the reactor. When the EWDS signals an alarm, small amounts of inhibitor or retarder {{have been added to the}} reaction mixture. The use <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> that can destroy the free radicals during polymerization processes is a good method to stop the reaction if a runaway phenomenon occurs. In this work the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> hydroquinone and 1, 4 -benzoquinone was investigated in methylmethacrylate polymerization processes. The first behaved as an inhibitor, the second as a retarder. In order to control an emulsion polymerization process benzoquinone is preferred because, if added during the reaction, it does not completely stop the process but diminishes the polymerization rate giving a higher final conversion. An Early Warning Detection System (EWDS) has been used to identify anomalous process conditions that can lead to runaway reactions. The EWDS performance has been satisfactory: in fact anomalous temperature behaviours have been early detected without producing false alarms...|$|R
