40|$|Research in <b>bidirectional</b> data <b>flow</b> {{analysis}} {{seems to}} {{have come to a}} halt due to an impression that the case for <b>bidirectional</b> data <b>flow</b> analysis has been considerably weakened by a plethora of investigations based on decomposability of known bidirectional placement algorithms into a sequence of purely unidirectional components. This paper shows that the approach of decomposability is not general enough in that it derives its power from the simplifying graph transformation of edge-splitting and the favourable nature of flows in partial redundancy elimination (PRE). This follows from {{the fact that in the}} absence of edge-splitting, PRE cannot be performed using a sequence of cascaded unidirectional flows. Further, edge-splitting inherently converts data flows involved in PRE into unidirectional flows. In our opinion, this obviates the need of an alternative formulation. We also show that edge-splitting cannot convert data flows involved in "truly" <b>bidirectional</b> data <b>flow</b> problems into unidirectional flows. Thus not every <b>bidirectional</b> data <b>flow</b> problem can be converted into unidirectional flows. Besides, we argue that the premise that bidirectional analysis is more complex than unidirectional analysis, is invalid. We also mention some issues in <b>bidirectional</b> data <b>flow</b> analysis which need to be investigated...|$|R

50|$|In biology, a connexon, {{also known}} as a connexin hemichannel, is an {{assembly}} of six proteins called connexins that form the pore for a gap junction between the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells. This channel allows for <b>bidirectional</b> <b>flow</b> of ions and signaling molecules. The connexon is the hemichannel supplied by a cell {{on one side of the}} junction; two connexons from opposing cells normally come together to form the complete intercellular gap junction channel. However, in some cells, the hemichannel itself is active as a conduit between the cytoplasm and the extracellular space, allowing the transference of ions and small molecules lower than 1-2 KDa. Little is known about this function of connexons besides the new evidence suggesting their key role in intracellular signaling.|$|E
50|$|Messages {{travel through}} the {{sympathetic}} nervous system in a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>flow.</b> Efferent messages can trigger changes {{in different parts of}} the body simultaneously. For example, the sympathetic nervous system can accelerate heart rate; widen bronchial passages; decrease motility (movement) of the large intestine; constrict blood vessels; increase peristalsis in the esophagus; cause pupillary dilation, piloerection (goose bumps) and perspiration (sweating); and raise blood pressure. One exception is with certain blood vessels such as those in the cerebral and coronary arteries, which dilate (rather than constrict) with an increase in sympathetic tone. This is because of a proportional increase in the presence of β2 adrenergic receptors rather than α1 receptors. β2 receptors promote vessel dilation instead of constriction like α1 receptors.|$|E

It enables informed {{planning and management}} of network resources, as well as detection and a comprehensive understanding of malicious activity. It requires a set of tools to efficiently collect, process, and represent network data. While many such tools already exist, there is no flexible and practical solution for visualizing network activity at various granularities, and quickly gaining insights {{about the status of}} network assets. To address this issue, we developed Nfsight, a Net-Flow processing and visualization application designed to offer a comprehensive network awareness solution. Nfsight constructs <b>bidirectional</b> <b>flows</b> out of the unidirectional NetFlow flows and leverages these <b>bidirectional</b> <b>flows</b> to provide client/server identification and intrusion detection capabilities.

50|$|In the 1990s, a new {{perspective}} emerged in the field with the classic study of Cumbrian Sheep Farmers' interaction with the Nuclear scientists in England, where Brian Wynne demonstrated how the experts were ignorant or disinterested in {{taking into account the}} lay knowledge of the sheep farmers while conducting field experiments on the impact of the Chernobyl Nuclear fall out on the sheep in the region.

Following this study, scholars have studies similar micro-sociological contexts of expert-lay interaction and proposed that the context of knowledge communication is important to understand public engagement with science.

40|$|Network coding is a {{promising}} technique for improving system performance in wireless multihop networks. In this paper, the throughput and fairness in single-relay multi-user wireless networks are evaluated. The {{carrier sense multiple access}} with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol and network coding {{are used in}} the medium access control (MAC) sublayer in such networks. The fairness of wireless medium access among stations (STAs), the access point (AP), and the relay station (RS) results in asymmetric <b>bidirectional</b> <b>flows</b> via the RS; as a result the wireless throughput decreases substantially. To overcome this problem, an autonomous optimization of minimum contention window size is developed for CSMA/CA and network coding to assign appropriate transmission opportunities to both the AP and RS. By optimizing the minimum contention window size according to the number of STAs, the wireless throughput in single-relay multi-user networks can be improved and the fairness between <b>bidirectional</b> <b>flows</b> via the RS can be achieved.

40|$|AIMS: Stent {{deployment}} causes {{endothelial cell}} (EC) denudation, which promotes in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Thus endothelial regrowth in stented arteries {{is an important}} therapeutic goal. Stent struts modify local hemodynamics, however the effects of flow pertubation on EC injury and repair are incompletely understood. By studying the effects of stent struts on flow and EC migration we identified an intervention that promotes endothelial repair in stented arteries. METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro and in vivo models were developed to monitor endothelialization under flow {{and the influence of}} stent struts. A 2 D parallel-plate flow chamber with 100 ??m ridges arranged perpendicular to the flow was used. Live cell imaging coupled to computational fluid dynamic simulations revealed that EC migrate in the direction of flow upstream from the ridges but subsequently accumulate downstream from ridges at sites of <b>bidirectional</b> <b>flow.</b> The mechanism of EC trapping by <b>bidirectional</b> <b>flow</b> involved reduced migratory polarity associated with altered actin dynamics. Inhibition of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) enhanced endothelialization of ridged surfaces by promoting migratory polarity under <b>bidirectional</b> <b>flow</b> (p< 0. 01). To more closely mimic the in vivo situation we cultured EC on the inner surface of polydimethylsiloxane tubing containing Coroflex Blue stents (65 ??m struts) and monitored migration. ROCK inhibition significantly enhanced EC accumulation downstream from struts under flow (p< 0. 05). We investigated the effects of ROCK inhibition on re-endothelialization in vivo using a porcine model of EC denudation and stent placement. En face staining and confocal microscopy revealed that inhibition of ROCK using fasudil (30 mg/day via osmotic minipump) significantly increased re-endothelialization of stented carotid arteries (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Stent struts delay endothelial repair by generating localised <b>bidirectional</b> <b>flow</b> which traps migrating EC. ROCK inhibitors accelerate endothelial repair of stented arteries by enhancing EC polarity and migration through regions of <b>bidirectional</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|E
