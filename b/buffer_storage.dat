30|$|The map of {{the costs}} {{obtained}} with the simulation environment developed can be a decision support system to choose the best model evaluating the condition of production rate, preventive maintenance actions time required, and the <b>buffer</b> <b>storages</b> allocation.|$|R
30|$|The {{works on}} {{preventive}} maintenance policy and machine breakdowns are often simplified. For example, {{the time to}} perform the maintenance activities are assumed negligible, and the real utilization of the <b>buffer</b> <b>storages</b> is not considered because the costs are computed on the maximum level allowed.|$|R
30|$|The first {{consideration}} {{concerns the}} evaluation of the costs related to the increase in the production rate. Generally, the improvement in production rate is proportional to the investments in the buffer and preventive maintenance actions. The benefit of the PM is more relevant when the production rate required is higher (cases 5, 6 and 7). The dynamic allocation of the <b>buffer</b> <b>storages</b> works better when the production rate required is higher (case 7) reducing drastically the costs with the same level of the production rate of the other models tested. The cases of low production rate required (cases 1, 2, and 3) the fixed allocation of the <b>buffer</b> <b>storages</b> and dynamic PM actions lead to better results in terms of costs and production rate.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{representative}} burst buffer architectures in the {{high-performance computing}} environments: node-local burst buffer and remote shared burst buffer. In the node-local burst buffer architecture, burst <b>buffer</b> <b>storage</b> {{is located on}} the individual compute node, so the aggregate burst buffer bandwidth grows linearly with the compute node count. This scalability benefit has been well-documented in recent literature.It also comes with the demand for a scalable metadata management strategy to maintain a global namespace for data distributed across all the burst buffers. In the remote shared burst buffer architecture, burst <b>buffer</b> <b>storage</b> resides on a fewer number of I/O nodes positioned between the compute nodes and the back-end storage systems. Data movement between the compute nodes and burst buffer needs to go through the network. Placing burst buffer on the I/O nodes facilitates the independent development, deployment and maintenance of the burst buffer service. Hence, several well-known commercialized software products have been developed to manage this type of burst buffer, such as DataWarp and Infinite Memory Engine.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Selfish Brain" [...] {{theory can}} be {{considered}} as a new way to understand obesity. Disorders in the control centers of the brain such as the hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus are thought to underlie this, as outlined above. Whatever the type of disruption that exists, it entails that the energy procurement for the brain is accomplished less by allocation and more by the intake of nutrients even though the muscles have no additional energy requirement. If one imagines the energy supply of the human organism as a supply-chain that passes from the outside world with its numerous options for nutrient intake via the body to the brain as the end user and control organ, then obesity {{can be considered}} as being caused by a build-up in this supply-chain. This is characterized by an excessive accumulation of energy in the adipose tissue or blood. An allocation failure is expressed as a weakening of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The result is that energy intended for the brain mainly enters <b>buffer</b> <b>storage</b> areas, i.e. the adipose tissue and the musculature. Only a small proportion reaches the brain. In order to cover its huge energy needs the brain commands the individual to consume more food. The accumulation process escalates, and the <b>buffer</b> <b>storage</b> areas are continuously filled up. This leads to the development of obesity. In many cases, at a time which is dependent on an affected individual's personal disposition, obesity can also be overlain by a diabetes mellitus. In such a situation the adipose tissue and musculature can no longer accept any energy, and the energy then accumulates in the blood so that hyperglycemia results.|$|E

50|$|A {{combined}} {{storage tank}} combines {{hot water storage}} both for heating support and drinking water heating in a larger tank. As a result, warm water, typically from solar thermal energy, is stored temporarily for both purposes for later consumption. Breaks in sunshine can thus be bridged without any additional heating, depending on the heating requirement and storage size. This generally takes up less space than two individual buffer tanks and thermal losses are thereby reduced. These storage tanks are mostly insulated {{on the outside and}} designed for the lowest possible heat losses. Usually, it is a tank-in-tank system, that is, a two-compartment system arranged one inside the other. It is thus a combined <b>buffer</b> <b>storage</b> tank with a heat exchange plate in between.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{technical characteristic}} of a part handling and transport system which supports a factory layout of machine tools or an FMS is the required part transport speed from machining-(inspection-, assembly-) station to station.

It is also dependent on the machine operation scheduling and on the maximum machine utilization requirement. In the paper, a new machine serving methodology is presented and analysed.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{stochastic}} production model that {{is useful for}} examining the behaviour of complex systems. The model {{is made up of}} a linked system of production processes (units) together with <b>buffer</b> <b>storages</b> between the units. The productive capacity of the units are subject to random breakdown and periodic maintenance. Branching and recycling of intermediate products and materials, as well as inter-dependence of operation between units, are allowed. It is not always clear how best to operate such a system or to check that a given operating policy is well-defined. The model is rigorously developed and analysed using the theory of maximal solutions of differential inequalities with discontinuous right-hand sides. It is shown that when the capacities of the units possess a certain quasi-monotone increasing property, then there exists a well-defined, greedy 'full-on' operating policy. Moreover the policy maximizes throughput globally so that it is thus never optimal to try to balance the output of units to try to smooth production or to 'save for a rainy day'. Several examples are given showing the flexibility of the model...|$|R
