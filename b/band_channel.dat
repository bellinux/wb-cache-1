25|$|Attempts at border-blasting were {{somewhat}} more common {{on the other}} side of the border, where smaller markets in the United States could find lucrative larger markets in Canada within their broadcast range. WIVB-TV, prior to the digital television transition, could be seen as a U.S. border blaster into Canada (as Western New York is a smaller market than Southern Ontario, which boasts the major world city of Toronto); it operated with 100,000 watts of power on the VHF low <b>band</b> (<b>channel</b> 4), even after the Federal Communications Commission reduced the maximum allowed power for that band to 80,000 watts. (WIVB did not make significant attempts to reach the Canadian market, although rival station WKBW-TV did.) Another famous U.S.-based border blaster into Canada was KCND-TV in Pembina, North Dakota; Pembina was a small border town of less than 1,000 residents, which normally would be far too small of a market to support a television station, but spent its fifteen-year existence targeting Winnipeg, a much larger city sixty miles north of Pembina. Likewise, the small market of Burlington, Vermont and Plattsburgh, New York found it could reach a larger audience in Montreal. Canadian regulators put in simultaneous substitution requirements to prevent losing revenue to these American border-blasters (this forced KCND's owners to sell the station to Canadian interests, who transformed the station into modern-day Winnipeg, Manitoba-based CKND-TV; Burlington station WFFF-TV entered into a famous cross-border scheduling feud over the simsub problems, while WKBW competed mainly by focusing on its unique brand of local news, which could not be simsubbed).|$|E

40|$|Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has {{recently}} been applied in wireless communication systems due to its high data rate transmission capability with high bandwidth efficiency and its robustness to multi-path delay. UWB (Ultra Wide Band) OFDM communication was proposed for physical layer in the IEEE 802. 15. 3 a standard which covers wideband communication in wireless personal area networks. The ultra-wide bandwidth offers pulses with very short duration that provides frequency diversity and multipath resolution. Ultra-wide <b>band</b> (UWB) <b>channels</b> raise new effects in the receiver, the amplitude fading statistics being different compared to the conventional narrow <b>band</b> wireless <b>channels.</b> This paper focuses on modelling and analysis of multiband OFDM for ultra-wide <b>band</b> <b>channels,</b> especially for simulation of personal area networks and also discusses the benefits, application potential and technical challenges in wideband communication...|$|R

This additive 1 /f noise is a system noise generated due to miniaturization of hardware and affects the lower frequencies. Though 1 /f noise does not show much effect in wide <b>band</b> <b>channels</b> because of its nature to affect only certain frequencies, 1 /f noise becomes a prominent in OFDM communication systems where narrow <b>band</b> <b>channels</b> are used. in this thesis, I {{study the effects of}} 1 /f noise on the OFDM systems and implement algorithms for estimation and suppression of the noise using Kalman filter. Suppression of the noise is achieved by subtracting the estimated noise from the received noise. I show that the performance of the system is considerably improved by applying the 1 /f noise suppression...|$|R
