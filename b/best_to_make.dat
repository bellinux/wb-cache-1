500|$|As {{stated by}} Warren Ellis, Hellblazer's major themes were cynicism, {{nihilism}} and [...] "sudden violence", with the protagonist oftentimes narrating {{the story in}} dark proses with occasional breaking of the fourth wall. In many story arcs every victory Constantine makes has a negative side effect and often leads to tragedy. His friends, family, and others would be sacrificed or {{be caught in the}} crossfire, many of them are dead or have left him. John tries his <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> something good in his life, but most of it leading to failure.|$|E

He went [...] "all out" [...] and did his <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Homer's grimaces as humorous as possible, to keep the episode at least somewhat lighter in tone. Silverman added some special touches: for example, when Homer has an out of body experience, his foot was still touching his body to signify that he was not dead. A doctor acted as a medical consultant for the episode.|$|E

Thompson's father assisted the band financially, loaning $1,000 in order to record the demo tape; Thompson later said that his father [...] "wasn't around for a lot of my younger years, so I think he was doing his <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for lost time." [...] The Purple Tape led to a recording contract with the English independent record label 4AD.

500|$|Alpha Centauri {{provides}} a single player mode and supports customization and multiplayer. Players may customize {{the game by}} choosing options {{at the beginning of}} the game, using the built-in scenario and map editors, and modifying Alpha Centauris game files. In addition to a choice of seven (or 14 in Alien Crossfire) factions, pre-game options include scenario game, customized random map, difficulty level, and game rules that include victory conditions, research control, and initial map knowledge. The scenario and map editors allow players to create customized scenarios and maps. The game's basic rules, diplomatic dialog, and the factions' starting abilities are in text files, which [...] "the designers have done their <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it reasonably easy to modify..., even for non-programmers." [...] Alpha Centauri supports play by email ("PBEM") and TCP/IP mode featuring simultaneous movement, and introduces direct player-to-player negotiation, allowing the unconstrained trade of technology, energy, maps, and other elements.|$|E
500|$|During the siege, Union gunboats lobbed over 22,000 shells {{into the}} town and army {{artillery}} fire was even heavier. As the barrages continued, suitable housing in Vicksburg {{was reduced to a}} minimum. A ridge, located between the main town and the rebel defense line, provided a diverse citizenry with lodging for the duration. Over 500 caves, known locally as [...] "bombproofs," [...] were dug into the yellow clay hills of Vicksburg. Whether houses were structurally sound or not, it was deemed safer to occupy these dugouts. People did their <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them comfortable, with rugs, furniture, and pictures. They tried to time their movements and foraging with the rhythm of the cannonade, sometimes unsuccessfully. Because of the citizens' burrowing, the Union soldiers gave the town the nickname of [...] "Prairie Dog Village." [...] Despite the ferocity of the Union fire against the town, fewer than a dozen civilians were known to have been killed during the entire siege.|$|E

Her {{intention}} was to remain in theater, but in her second semester took a class taught by Tracy Fullerton {{on the history of}} game design, which inspired her to focus her studies on video game design instead. The class caused her to realize [...] "how much hadn't been done" [...] in the realm of communication and expression in video games and the lack of established structure and rules as to how it was <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> games, which appealed to the part of her that was interested in experimental theater. While at school she produced the award-winning game Cloud, developed by Jenova Chen and a student team, and also worked on other video games such as Darfur is Dying.|$|E
500|$|In late 2006, St. John and Howarth {{simultaneously}} began {{contract negotiations}} with their respective shows, which caused rumors that St. John was departing from OLTL, leaving room for Howarth, {{who was with}} the soap opera As the World Turns at the time, to return as Todd. TV Guide sought to clear up the matter and questioned executive producer Frank Valentini, who stated that although {{he was not able}} to comment on contracts, the producers were [...] "doing our <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that we do right by the audience". [...] In 2007, TV Guide received official confirmation Howarth would not be returning to the series. [...] The magazine conducted a poll on its website, TV Guide.com, and found that 82 percent of the show's viewers wanted to see Howarth return. [...] Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide.com disagreed with the results, stating, [...] "Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I absolutely adore Trevor St. John", whose portrayal of Todd he found [...] "very cocky, arrogant and humorous in a sexy way".|$|E

[...] In 1850, McCulloh resigned. [...] In November of that year, the former official {{published an article}} in the New York Evening Express alleging that those employed at the Mint had transformed [...] "it into a workshop for their gain". [...] President Millard Fillmore sent the article to Secretary of the Treasury Corwin for an explanation; Corwin forwarded it to Patterson, who confirmed that Peale was running a private medal business on the premises, but stated that there was no interference with the performance of Peale's duties as Chief Coiner. [...] Taxay noted that this was only true because the retired Adam Eckfeldt was still performing the duties of that office without salary, and this ceased in February 1852 when Eckfeldt died after a brief illness. [...] The death of his predecessor caused Peale to write [...] "a frantic letter" [...] to the new Mint Director (Patterson had retired), George N. Eckert, stating that he urgently needed an assistant.|$|E

500|$|CEDA {{turned its}} {{campaign}} chest over to army plotter Emilio Mola. [...] Monarchist José Calvo Sotelo replaced CEDA's Gil Robles as the right's leading spokesman in parliament. The Falange expanded rapidly, and {{many members of}} the Juventudes de Acción Popular joined. They successfully created a sense of militancy on the streets to try to justify an authoritarian regime. Prieto did his best to avoid revolution by promoting a series of public works and civil order reforms, including of parts of the military and civil guard. Largo Caballero took a different attitude, continuing to preach of an inevitable overthrow of society by the workers. Largo Caballero also disagreed with Prieto's idea of a new Republican–Socialist coalition. With Largo Caballero's acquiescence, communists alarmed the middle classes by quickly taking over the ranks of socialist organisations. This alarmed the middle classes. The division of the Popular Front prevented the government from using its power to prevent right-wing militancy. The CEDA came under attack from the Falange, and Prieto's attempts at moderate reform were attacked by the Socialist Youth. Sotelo continued to do his <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> conciliation impossible.|$|E
500|$|Ball then {{requested}} {{a few days}} off but, to his dismay, was temporarily reassigned to aerial reconnaissance duty with No.8 Squadron, where he flew B.E.2s from 18 July until 14 August. During this posting, Ball undertook an unusual mission. On the evening of 28 July, he flew a French espionage agent across enemy lines. Dodging an attack by three German fighters, as well as anti-aircraft fire, he landed in a deserted field, only to find that the agent refused {{to get out of the}} aircraft. While he was on reconnaissance duties with No. 8 Squadron, the London Gazette announced that he had been awarded the Military Cross [...] "for conspicuous skill and gallantry on many occasions," [...] particularly for [...] "one occasion [...] he attacked six in one flight". This was not unusual; throughout his career, Ball generally attacked on sight and heedless of the odds. He professed no hatred for his opponents, writing to his parents [...] "I only scrap because it is my duty... Nothing makes me feel more rotten than to see them go down, but you see it is either them or me, so I must do my duty <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it a case of them".|$|E
500|$|While Petre Dumitriu is {{motivated}} by his pursuit of discipline, his wife preserves her sophistication, reading the works of Marcel Proust, playing the harpsichord, employing a nanny to educate her children, and comparing the surrounding landscape with Japan's Mount Fuji. Variety calls her [...] "sensitive-yet-flamboyant in the mold of Zelda Fitzgerald". To her husband's assurance {{that they were not}} going to spend long in Southern Dobruja, she replies: [...] "I like it here." [...] In pursuing this path, she only manages to widen the gap between her and most other characters. This rift is made apparent by a number of omens: unknown attackers throw rocks into the Dumitrius' house, while the vegetables she planted in the garden prove unpalatable. Confronted with these signs, Von Debretsy still attempts to make the best of the situation; online film critic James Berardinelli notes: [...] " [...] does her <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a happy home for her family, despite stray bullets that shatter mirrors." [...] Bulgarian locals, taken as hostages by the military, are made to work on the garden. Their labor brings immediate improvement to the crop, and, upset by their condition, Marie-Thérèse decides to pay them out of her own pocket, serves them tea and eventually befriends them. In a scene that provided the original title for Petru Dumitriu's book chapter ("The Salad"), she invites Ipsilanti and other officers to dinner, and they are all shown to be enjoying the salad provided by Bulgarian labor. However, the episode also renews tensions between Ipsilanti and his Hungarian host, when she expresses her appreciation of her servants' work and attempts to intervene on their behalf.|$|E

500|$|Her {{marriage}} to Ernst suffered a further blow in 1897, when Victoria {{returned home from}} a visit to her sister Queen Marie of Romania and reportedly caught Ernst {{in bed with a}} male servant. She did not make her accusation public, but told a niece that [...] "no boy was safe, from the stable hands to the kitchen help. He slept quite openly with them all." [...] Queen Victoria was saddened when she heard of trouble in the marriage from Sir George Buchanan, her chargé d'affaires, but refused to consider permitting her grandchildren to divorce because of their daughter, Elisabeth. Efforts to rekindle the marriage failed and, when Queen Victoria died in January 1901, significant opposition {{to the end of the}} marriage was removed. The Supreme Court of Hesse dissolved the marriage on 21 December 1901. Ernst, who had at first resisted the divorce, came to believe it was the only possible step. [...] "Now that I am calmer I see the absolute impossibility of going on leading a life which was killing her and driving me nearly mad," [...] Ernst wrote to his elder sister Princess Louis of Battenberg. [...] "For to keep up your spirits and a laughing face while ruin is staring you in the eyes and misery is tearing your heart to pieces is a struggle which is fruitless. I only tried for her sake. If I had not loved her so, I would have given it up long ago." [...] Princess Louis later wrote that she was less surprised by the divorce than Ernst was. [...] "Though both had done their <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a success of their marriage, it had been a failure ...heir characters and temperaments were quite unsuited to each other and I had noticed how they were gradually drifting apart." [...] The divorce of the reigning Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Hesse caused scandal in the royal circles of Europe.
