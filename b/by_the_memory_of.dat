5|$|In the song, {{the protagonist}} kisses {{different}} lips {{looking for new}} sensations, haunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> a past love. The song has experienced popular acclaim, especially with the version recorded by Mexican singer Luis Miguel on his album Romance released in 1991. This version peaked {{at the top of}} the Billboard Top Latin Songs chart in the United States, and the album was deemed as responsible for reviving the bolero genre.|$|E
5|$|Juskalian {{was then}} {{assigned}} to Alaska as commandant of the Arctic Warfare School. Still embittered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> having {{spent most of}} World War II as a POW, he requested his orders be changed from Alaska to Korea where United States forces were engaged in combat operations {{as part of the}} United Nations forces committed to Korean War. His request was approved and in the summer of 1952 he was sent to the combat zone.|$|E
5|$|A young Serb {{boy from}} the {{vicinity}} of Višegrad is taken from his mother by the Ottomans {{as part of the}} devşirme levy, one of many Christian boys to experience this fate during the Ottoman Empire's 500-year-long occupation of the Balkans. The boy's mother follows her son wailing until she reaches the Drina River, where he is taken across by ferry and she can no longer follow. The young boy is converted to Islam and assigned the Turkish name of Mehmed, becoming known as Mehmed-paša Sokolović. He rises through the Ottoman military ranks and around the age of 60 becomes the Grand Vizier, a position he holds for the next fifteen years. During his time as Grand Vizier, he serves under three sultans and oversees the Ottoman Empire's expansion into Central Europe. He remains haunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> being forcibly taken from his mother and orders the construction of a bridge at the part of the river where the two became separated.|$|E

5|$|One night, Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian {{travel to}} the ocean surface to watch a celebration for the {{birthday}} of Prince Eric on a ship. Ariel instantly becomes enamored with Eric. A violent storm arrives, with {{a bolt of lightning}} striking the ship, engulfing it in flames and eventually destroying it, tossing Eric overboard. She rescues Eric and brings him to shore. Ariel sings to Eric, but immediately leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> her voice, Eric vows to find who saved and sang to him, and Ariel vows {{to find a way to}} join him and his world. When Triton discovers Ariel's love for Eric, Triton confronts her in the grotto and destroys most of the artifacts with his trident. After Triton leaves, two eels named Flotsam and Jetsam convince Ariel to visit Ursula, a sea witch.|$|E
5|$|P. R. Brown {{directed}} this video, which premiered on VH1 Classic on 8 August 2006. There are {{similarities between}} the video for Meat Loaf's version of the song, and that the video for that of Celine Dion, with Meat Loaf being haunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> his lover. It is structured differently, however, with the story being told through flashback. Shots when Raven's character is alive have a distinct yellow tint, with a darker, blue tint for those after her death. Whereas the motorcyclist dies before the first verse in the Dion version, Raven's crash and resulting death is not shown until the final chorus. Meat Loaf becomes angry with Raven because the ghost of Raven's former lover appears at a masquerade ball they are attending (some reviewers have compared this to the Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut).|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the worldwide scale of the Register, some countries or groups of countries have also established national (i.e. national registers) and regional counterparts, resulting in a three-tiered Register that has been supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>of</b> the World Programme. This allows for the better administration of documentary items.|$|E

25|$|A {{desire for}} {{successful}} assertive action against {{terrorism in the}} Reagan administration was further spurred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the political cost born by President Jimmy Carter {{for a lack of}} the same (his inability to free American hostages seized by student demonstrators in Iran was held to been a major factor in his failed 1980 reelection bid). Despite covert CIA searches, the Reagan administration had also been frustrated in its inability to find American hostages held being in the Lebanon hostage crisis that had began in 1982, nor had they had an opportunity for decisive action in the recent TWA hijacking.|$|E
25|$|Buddy warns Phyllis that Sally {{is still}} in love with Ben, and she is shaken by how the past threatens to repeat itself. Sally is awed by Ben’s {{apparently}} glamorous life, but Ben wonders if he made the right choices and considers how things might have been ("The Road You Didn't Take"). Sally tells Ben how her days have been spent with Buddy, trying to convince him (and herself) ("In Buddy’s Eyes"). But it is clear that Sally {{is still in}} love with Ben – even though their affair ended badly when Ben decided to marry Phyllis. She shakes loose from the memory and begins to dance with Ben, who is touched <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the Sally he once cast aside.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish Civil War {{proved a}} major test for {{international}} pacifism, {{and the work}} of pacifist organisations (such as War Resisters' International and the Fellowship of Reconciliation) and individuals (such as José Brocca and Amparo Poch) in that arena has until recently been ignored or forgotten by historians, overshadowed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the International Brigades and other militaristic interventions. Shortly after the war ended, Simone Weil, despite having volunteered for service on the republican side, went on to publish The Iliad or the Poem of Force, a work that {{has been described as a}} pacifist manifesto. In response to the threat of fascism, some pacifist thinkers, such as Richard B. Gregg, devised plans for a campaign of nonviolent resistance in the event of a fascist invasion or takeover.|$|E

60|$|She {{stopped dead}} short. They stared {{at one another}} in {{profound}} stillness, with astounded eyes, with eyes maddened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> things far off that seemed lost in the lapse of time. Their looks crossed, passed each other, and appeared to dart at them through fantastic distances, to come straight from the incredible.|$|R
25|$|Among {{the most}} heart-wrenching {{of the losses}} was that of Maria Sergio and her four children, 13-year-old Giuseppe, 10-year-old Anna Maria, seven-year-old Domenica, and four-year-old Rocco, who {{occupied}} a cabin on the starboard side of C Deck which was in direct line of the collision. She was traveling aboard Andrea Doria with her children {{on her way to}} South Bend, Indiana, where her husband, Ross Sergio, and their 17-year-old son Anthony, were waiting for them. Anthony Sergio had in fact sailed to the United States from Italy aboard the Andrea Doria the previous April. Also traveling with them were Maria's sister Margaret and her husband Paul Sergio, who also happened to be Ross Sergio's brother. Paul and Margaret had emigrated to the U.S. prior to the voyage and had returned to Italy for a visit and to accompany Maria and the children back to Indiana. Both Paul and Margaret survived the sinking, and for years after the disaster, Paul was haunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> his four-year-old nephew Rocco, the youngest of his brother's children, who just prior to the collision had asked if he could spend the night with his uncle.|$|E
500|$|Archduke Maximilian was haunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> Maria Amélia, {{and after}} his {{marriage}} to Charlotte of Belgium he made a pilgrimage in 1859–60 to locations connected to his ex-fiancée. Upon reaching the island of Madeira, he wrote: [...] "Here died, of tuberculosis, on 4February 1853, the only daughter of the Empress of Brazil, an extraordinarily gifted creature. She left this flawed world, pure as an angel who returns to Heaven, her true native land." ...|$|E
500|$|P. R. Brown {{directed}} the videos for [...] "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" [...] and [...] "Cry over Me." [...] "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" [...] is an elaborate production, in which Meat Loaf is being haunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> his dead lover. Told in flashback, Raven's character crashes her car {{to avoid a}} man standing in the road. She sings as an unseen spirit following Meat Loaf. It echoes Steinman's comments that the song is about the [...] "dark side of love" [...] and the [...] "ability to be resurrected by it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Chandradas and {{his brother}} take Haritha to their ancestral home where she spends a few days happily with them. However as the days pass on, she is haunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family she left behind and the happy times she spent with them - {{especially}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> thoughts of the love and kindness showered on her by her step-father.|$|R
50|$|Jiyu's father. He is {{a stay-at-home}} ghostwriter of {{historic}} samurai novels. He cares greatly {{for his daughter}} and affectionately nicknames her Jubei.

After the incident, he promised to be a better father to Jiyu and subsequently started working at home.|$|R
50|$|Using acrylic paint, {{photomontage}} {{and mixed}} media, Elias creates powerful, striking images, with strong shapes and contrasting colours. Influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> family and cinema during his 1950s childhood {{and his love}} of poetry and art, his work uses memory and imagination, responding to and drawing inspiration from global issues and currents, while also being strongly rooted in the visual language of the south Wales valleys.|$|R
500|$|To {{find a new}} co-pilot, Raleigh {{participates in}} tryouts, {{assuming}} Mako is [...] "drift-compatible", despite Pentecost's protests. During their first Drifting test, Raleigh is distracted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> Yancy’s death. Mako, in turn, is lost {{in the memory of}} the Kaiju attack on Tokyo that orphaned her, and nearly fires Gipsys plasma cannon. Mako is promptly relieved of piloting duties, and when Raleigh confronts Pentecost and tells him that he is being overprotective of her Pentecost reveals that he is a former Jaeger pilot who fought and killed the Kaiju that attacked Tokyo and adopted Mako upon discovering her after the battle he also further explains that he is dying as a result of piloting a Jaeger alone because without a co-pilot(who was his brother, that was killed during the battle), the brain will overload and eventually kills the pilot.|$|E
500|$|Though she {{described}} her Jewish household {{as being in}} many ways dominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the Holocaust, it nonetheless provided a happy childhood until she {{reached the age of}} nine, when an unknown man molested her in a movie theater. When Dworkin was 10, her family moved from the city to the suburbs of Cherry Hill, New Jersey (then known as Delaware Township), which she later wrote she [...] "experienced as being kidnapped by aliens and taken to a penal colony". In sixth grade, the administration at her new school punished her for refusing to sing [...] "Silent Night" [...] (as a Jew, she objected to being forced to sing Christian religious songs at school). She said she [...] "probably would have become a rabbi" [...] if women could have while she was in high school and she [...] "would have liked" [...] being a Talmudic scholar.|$|E
500|$|Van der Byl's {{habit of}} {{referring}} to the African population as [...] "munts" [...] (he asserted that [...] "Rhodesia is {{able to handle the}} munts") led to extreme unpopularity with the South African government, and he did not attend talks with South African Prime Minister John Vorster in October 1975. This was interpreted as being connected to a personal dislike. When, on 26 August 1976, the South African government announced the withdrawal of all its military helicopter crews from Rhodesia, Van der Byl was outspoken in his criticism and Vorster was reported to have refused {{to have anything to do}} with [...] "that dreadful man Van der Byl." [...] Smith decided that he [...] "clearly ... had no option" [...] and on 9 September 1976 executed a sudden cabinet reshuffle that ended Van der Byl's tenure as Defence Minister. Smith claimed the South African dislike of Van der Byl was partly motivated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> his father, who had been in opposition to the National Party.|$|E
50|$|His {{excessive}} drinking affects {{his mood}} and his work. Scott is haunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> Zelda and <b>the</b> success and fun they had together.

50|$|Meanwhile, the {{children}} and Anja are found by Bostjan {{and one of his}} partisans, but as Bostjan threatens to execute Anja, Ettore arrives, immobilizes Bostjan and kills the other partisan. As Bostjan tries to grab a weapon, Ettore kills him too. Anja, shocked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> her rape <b>by</b> Bostjan that have come back, tries to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff, but Ettore succeeds in dissuading her.|$|R
50|$|People's {{conception}} {{of who they}} are can be shaped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choices they make; the college favored over the one renounced, the job chosen over the one rejected, the candidate elected instead of another one not selected. <b>Memories</b> <b>of</b> chosen as well as forgone alternatives can affect one's sense of well-being. Regret for options not taken can cast a shadow, whereas satisfaction at having made the right choice can make a good outcome seem even better.|$|R
500|$|Elisabeth's {{body was}} placed in a silver casket, a gift from Nicholas II, for the journey back to Darmstadt. Her father {{arranged}} a white funeral, with white instead of black for the funeral trappings, white flowers, and white horses for the procession. The Hessian people came out by the thousands to view the funeral procession and [...] "sobbed in unison so that I could hear it," [...] Ernst wrote. A cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm II, expressed shock at the child's death in a letter to Tsar Nicholas II on 7 November 1903. [...] "How joyous and merry she was that day at Wolfsgarten, when I was there, so full of life and fun and health ... What a terrible heartrending blow for poor Ernie, who doted and adored that little enchantress!" [...] Elisabeth was buried in the Rosenhöhe {{with other members of the}} Hessian grand ducal family. A marble angel was later installed to watch over her grave. In a final gesture to Elisabeth and Ernst, Victoria Melita placed her badge of the Order of Hesse, granted to her upon her marriage, into Elisabeth's coffin. Ernst was still devastated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> his daughter's death thirty years later. [...] "My little Elisabeth," [...] he wrote in his memoirs, [...] "was the sunshine of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Part of Your World" [...] {{serves as}} The Little Mermaids theme song. The entire film is defined around [...] "Part of Your World", which {{provides}} the film with momentum within its first 15 minutes. As [...] "the heart and {{centre of the}} score," [...] several instrumental versions of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] are heard throughout the film {{in the form of}} a leitmotif, overtures incorporated into its orchestral score. Although the theme belongs to Ariel, it remains [...] "the film's most consistent thematic idea" [...] and is thus manipulated throughout The Little Mermaid to various affects for other characters as well that range from melancholic to sinister. The film's main title is a choral arrangement of the ballad, performed without any lyrics. After Ariel rescues Eric and returns him to safety on a nearby beach, she sings a shorter reprise of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to him as he regains consciousness. A distorted version of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] plays while Triton destroys Ariel's grotto, Eric constantly plays the melody on his flue to show that he continues to be haunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the mysterious girl who saved his life, and a brass arrangement of the song is heard while Ursula magically transforms into a human named [...] "Vanessa" [...] in order to trick Eric into marrying her. Lastly, a final choral version, entitled [...] "Happy Ending", is performed after Ariel and Eric's wedding.|$|E
500|$|BBC Online {{described}} Oliver's positive qualities {{as being}} his [...] "boyishly charming" [...] manner and his general determination. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror deemed him a [...] "soft touch" [...] {{when he went}} to great lengths to help a young patient, and a Daily Mail review suggested that Oliver was [...] "really quite sweet", despite his apparent smugness. Oliver is flawed by a lack of confidence and his deceptive nature. He has a tendency to land his work colleagues in trouble, which has been conveyed through storylines with Daisha and Greg. What's on TV highlighted Oliver's [...] "lack of competence" [...] and called him petulant for betraying Penny after his promotion to F2 level. When his career began to deteriorate, the publication deemed him reckless, then found him hapless in the aftermath of her death, in reference to the way he [...] " [...] into despair, finding comfort in drink, drugs and his dead sister's flatmate." [...] The Sunday Mirror Kevin O'Sullivan reflected on Oliver's development since his arrival, with the observation, [...] "Once he was the strutting ladies' man of the wards, a veritable medical Casanova who exuded confidence and charm. But time has taken its toll on Oliver Valentine – and now he is just a shadow of his former self" [...] – a devastated and broken man, [...] "tormented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> his sibling and his guilty conscience." ...|$|E
50|$|The equally unique {{danger is}} that, because an unborn child {{has not yet}} {{developed}} a strong personal identity, the in utero exposure to Other Memory makes that individual highly susceptible to becoming possessed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> personality {{of one of their}} ancestors. Called an Abomination <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Bene Gesserit, a child born this way is always killed whenever possible. Unlike Alia, Ghanima never succumbs to Abomination; her mind is ultimately guarded from possession <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> her mother Chani.|$|R
50|$|Marks of Identity is {{a journey}} through the {{landscape}} of Spanish society in the {{quarter of a century}} that follows the Spanish Civil War. it is made by an individual who has been torn between Spain and exile existence and who is constantly haunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> his family's history and fate. The story includes this individuals view on political repression, economic boom and effects of tourism in a Spain that seems very far from Franco's days.|$|R

Tortured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> her mother's illness, Ana rebels against her aunt's authoritarian style, and in bouts of loneliness she variously imagines her mother's continued presence, or even her own suicide. Though diverted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of her two sisters, Ana's only truly close companions are the family maid, Rosa, and her pet guinea pig, Roni, whom she discovers dead in his cage one morning.|$|R
