Different type of biomass can be used for <b>gasification</b> <b>process</b> since there are no strict limitations for parameters of used fuel. Various types of biomass are used in Latvia for production of energy. Wood fuels make up the main part of used biomass in Latvia. However, many non-wood biomass types are available as well. This study presents the comparison of wood and non-wood biomass use in <b>gasification</b> <b>process.</b> Biomass <b>gasification</b> model based on thermodynamic equilibrium was used to simulate <b>gasification</b> <b>process</b> with various biomass types.

40|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} <b>gasification</b> <b>process</b> of Miscanthus giganteus biomass was {{examined}} using two methods. First an isothermal thermovolumetric method was applied. The measurement {{was conducted at}} 950 °C and pressure of 0. 1 MPa. Based on the continuous analysis {{of different kinds of}} gases formed during the <b>gasification</b> <b>process,</b> the thermovolumetric method allowed the determination of yields and composition of the resulting gas as well as the rate constant of CO formation. Then a non-isothermal thermogravimetric method was applied, during which the loss of weight of a sample as a function of temperature was recorded. In the course of the measurement, the temperature was raised from ambient to 950 °C and the pressure was 0. 1 MPa. As a result, a change in the carbon conversion degree was obtained. Moreover, TGA methods allow distinguishing various stages of the <b>gasification</b> <b>process</b> such as primary pyrolysis, secondary pyrolysis and gasification, and determining kinetic parameters for each stage. The presented methods differs from each other as they are based either on the analysis of changes in the resulting product or on the analysis of changes in the supplied feedstock, but both can be successfully used to the effective examination of kinetics of the <b>gasification</b> <b>process.</b> In addition, an important advantage of both methods is the possibility to carry out the <b>gasification</b> <b>process</b> for different solid fuels as coal, biomass, or solid waste in the atmosphere of a variety of gasification agents...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of the oxygen-blown coal <b>gasification</b> <b>process</b> inside a cross-type two-stage (E-Gas like) gasifier is studied with the commercial CFD solver ANSYS FLUENT. The {{purpose of this}} study is to use CFD simulation to improve understanding of the <b>gasification</b> <b>processes</b> in the E-Gas like gasifier. In this paper, chemical reaction time is assumed to be faster than the time scale of the turbulence eddies. All the species are assumed to mix in the intermolecular level. The 3 -D Navier-Stokes equations and species transport equations are solved with the eddy-breakup reaction model (instantaneous gasification). The influences of coal slurry concentration and O 2 /coal ratio on the <b>gasification</b> <b>process</b> are investigated. Under the condition of feeding carbon being almost completely converted, low slurry concentration is preferred over high concentration if more H 2 is wanted with lower syngas temperature; while higher slurry concentration is preferable for producing more CO with higher syngas temperature. The case of higher O 2 /Coal ratio results in more combustion and leads to lower syngas heating values and higher temperatures. Meanwhile, lower O 2 /Coal ratio involves more gasification reactions and results in higher CO concentration and lower temperature. The flow behavior in the gasifier, especially the single fuel injection design on the second stage, is examined and discussed. In summary, the trends of simulated results of coal combustion and <b>gasification</b> <b>processes</b> in the cross-type two-stage gasifier are reasonable and the developed simulation model in this study can be used as a tool for preliminary examination of the global effect of thermal-flow and turbulence on <b>gasification</b> <b>process.</b> Key words: clean coal technology, gasification modeling, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) ...|$|R
