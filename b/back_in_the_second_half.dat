5|$|Virginia Tech's {{first game}} of the season was at home against Central Florida on August 31. In a game that saw the debut of quarterback Marcus Vick, brother of former star Hokie Michael Vick, 10th-ranked Virginia Tech pulled out to an early lead before Central Florida fought <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half.</b> Tech recovered, however, and won the game, 48–29. Virginia Tech {{followed}} the victory with five others. On October 11, a fourth-ranked Hokie squad easily won against Syracuse University, 51–7, giving Virginia Tech a 6–0 record.|$|E
5|$|The Tigers led the AL Central {{for periods}} {{at the start}} of the season in April, {{ultimately}} tying for the lead on May 10 and taking the lead outright on May 16. The Tigers held at least a share of the divisional lead from then onwards, holding their largest lead of 7 games on September 6. Although the Tigers went 16–12 in September, their second-best month by winning percentage in 2009, they won just 1 of 4 games in October. The Twins went 16–11 and 4–0, respectively, over this same stretch to tie the Tigers for the divisional lead after the 162-game regular season. More broadly, the Tigers were 48–39 over the first half of the season while the Twins were 45–44 but the Twins came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> going 41–32 leading up to the tie-breaker while the Tigers went 38–37 over the same span. The Twins won 11 of the two teams' 18 match-ups that season prior to the tie-breaker.|$|E
5|$|The game, {{which was}} the sixth edition of the bowl, was {{expected}} to be an offensive shootout. Boise State averaged 42.4points during the 2007 season, while East Carolina averaged 31. That expectation turned out to be justified as East Carolina took a 31–14 lead in the first half. The Broncos fought <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half,</b> however, tying the score at 38 late in the fourth quarter after East Carolina's Chris Johnson fumbled the ball, allowing Bronco defender Marty Tadman to recover the ball and return it 47yards for a touchdown. The game remained tied until the final moments as East Carolina's Ben Hartman made a 34–yard game-winning field goal as time expired. The attendance of 30,467 was the largest crowd to attend a Hawaii Bowl game that did not feature the host school. Boise State's loss dropped them to a final 2007 record of 10–3, while East Carolina's final-game win earned them a record of 8–5.|$|E

5|$|Then the Colts faced their arch-rival New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. New England {{jumped to}} an early 21–3 lead, but Indianapolis stormed <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half,</b> outscoring the Patriots 32–13 with an {{additional}} field goal {{late in the first}} half. With 2:22 left in the game, the Colts had the ball on their own 20-yard line trailing 34–31. On the first four plays of the drive, Manning completed three passes, moving the ball 69yards to the Patriots 11-yard line in just 24 seconds. Three plays later, Addai scored a 3-yard touchdown run to put them in the lead, 38–34 with only 60 seconds left in regulation. The Patriots responded with a drive to the Colts 45-yard line, but defensive back Marlin Jackson ended the drive with an interception to give Indianapolis the win. This happened to be the biggest comeback in AFC-NFC Conference Championship history.|$|E
25|$|Wake Forest, trailed 27–24 at halftime, {{but came}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> behind 20 points from Chris Paul and 14 from Justin Gray.|$|E
25|$|Iowa {{jumped out}} to a 14–0 lead behind two {{touchdown}} passes by Ricky Stanzi. Unlike Stanzi, the offense would stall, however, which allowed the Red Wolves back into the game before the first half ended, with quarterback Corey Leonard connecting with Brandon Thompkins for a score. The Hawks would answer <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half,</b> as Tyler Sash's fifth interception on the year set up a 43-yard TD pass from Stanzi to Marvin McNutt.|$|E
50|$|On Christmas Day 1922 (now <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> Division), Moore scored five {{goals for}} Derby County in a 6-0 victory over Crystal Palace.|$|R
50|$|However the Australian team bounced <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> one-day international, beating <b>the</b> West Indies <b>in</b> a rain-shortened game, {{due in part}} to {{inspired}} batting by Kepler Wessels.|$|R

25|$|The club {{returned}} to the Europa League final for a third consecutive time, facing Liverpool in the 2016 Final. After being down 1–0 at half-time, Sevilla bounced <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> to eventual win 1–3, with one goal scored from Kévin Gameiro and two from club captain Coke. With the third consecutive Europa League title, Sevilla improved their record of most Europa League titles won, now having lifted the trophy five times {{in the span of}} only ten years.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} game on Saturday, the Seahawks {{defeated}} the Saints 23–15. The Seahawks held a 16–0 lead at halftime, but the Saints came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> {{to make the}} game interesting. The Seahawks were able to hold on after a late Saints comeback effort, including an onside kick recovery, fell short. The Seahawks' offense centered around a 28 carry, 140 yard rushing effort from Marshawn Lynch, who also scored on a 31-yard run in the fourth quarter.|$|E
25|$|Taylor would {{continue}} his dominance throughout 2005. However, after winning his 13th World Championship title in January 2006, he lost four matches in televised tournaments {{during the first}} half of the year. He lost to Jelle Klaasen and Simon Whitlock in the International Darts League tournament, and twice in a row to Raymond van Barneveld in the UK Open and the Las Vegas Desert Classic. He bounced <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> of the year to win the World Matchplay, the World Darts Trophy (a BDO affiliated event), and the World Grand Prix.|$|E
50|$|After a {{brilliant}} first full season <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> tier finishing 11th, Grimsby a season later really struggled and finished <b>the</b> 1999-2000 season <b>in</b> 20th, avoiding relegation {{at the expense}} of Buckley's former club Walsall.|$|R
50|$|After {{a season}} at amateurs Leyton, Seeburg left London and spent <b>the</b> 1910-11 season <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> Division with Burnley. After a spell at Grimsby Town later that year, he joined Reading, where {{he retired in}} 1912.|$|R
50|$|The {{club was}} relegated to Liga Mayor de Honduras {{at the end}} of <b>the</b> 2006-07 season. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> division, they were removed from the {{competition}} after failing to show up for two games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2009 Apertura.|$|R
25|$|Hawkins then caught an 18-yard TD pass to cap a 77-yard {{drive that}} lasted 34seconds, and Best rushed for a score on Cal's next drive as the Bears broke Arizona tackles on {{seemingly}} every play. Safety Thomas DeCoud blitzed Tuitama {{and forced the}} fumble Alualu recovered {{in the end zone}} with 2:12 left in the first quarter, putting the Bears up 28–3. Arizona steadily climbed <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half,</b> with Tuitama scoring on a 1-yard run and Thomas catching a 4-yard TD pass early in the fourth.|$|E
25|$|Kevin Riley {{stepped in}} at quarterback {{in an attempt}} to bring the Bears <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half.</b> He hit Shane Vereen in the end zone on the Bears' first {{possession}} of the third quarter on a 27-yard strike, but the play was negated because of an illegal receiver downfield penalty; he was then intercepted on a tipped pass. Both defenses were then able to keep each side from scoring into the fourth quarter. The Trojans were then able to sustain a drive downfield that ended with a 6-yard pass from Sanchez to Ronald Johnson to put the game away.|$|E
25|$|A {{highlight}} of the 1990s was the Cup finale against FC Sion in 1991. The Wankdorf was packed with 50,000 spectators, with both teams contributing to the atmosphere. At halftime, the Bernese led 2–0, but Sion shot <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> with three goals to win the Cup. In 1993, YB qualified for the UEFA Cup and met Celtic in the first round. Only 7,300 spectators came to the stadium for the home leg, and the game ended 0–0. Young Boys fell in Celtic Park in Glasgow before 21,500 spectators in extra time, 1–0, with André Baumann netting an own goal in the 105th minute.|$|E
50|$|<b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> Division with Forest, Smith {{quickly became}} disillusioned with the {{professional}} game {{and went on}} to spend time at non-league Nelson FC and York City before seeing out his career as a full-back for Heckmondwike <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yorkshire League.|$|R
50|$|The East {{tried to}} come <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> quarter but <b>the</b> score at halftime the West was still ahead of five points, 64-59. The Eastern Conference tied the game at 91 with two minutes and eight <b>seconds</b> {{remaining}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third quarter.|$|R
50|$|He led <b>the</b> team <b>in</b> tackles 4 {{straight}} years (-), until injuring his <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> game of <b>the</b> 2000 season and being replaced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starting lineup by rookie Brian Urlacher, who became an All-Pro and never relinquished the position back to him.|$|R
25|$|The Wanderers began Season 2017/18 {{with the}} FFA Cup. They started by {{defeating}} Wellington Phoenix 1-0 with new marquee signing Oriol Riera scoring in the 120th {{minute of the}} game. A routine 4-0 defeat of Bentleigh Greens followed in the Round of 16. The quarter final match against Blacktown City FC was an epic encounter. The Wanderers went out to an early 1-0 lead through a Oriol Riera penalty kick. Blacktown hit <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> and took the game to extra time, where substitute James Andrew scored to put Blacktown ahead. Riera popped up again in the 111th minute to equalise, and the Wanderers held their nerve in the shootout to win it 4-2.|$|E
25|$|The {{last game}} in August saw League Two Hereford United visit St Andrew's {{in the second}} round of the League Cup. Two first half goals from Garry O'Connor and Gary McSheffrey saw Blues lead at half time, only for Hereford to fight <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> to score through Theo Robinson. But it was too little too late from the Herefordshire side as Blues dumped them out of the cup. Blues' {{exploits}} in the League Cup came to an undramatic end as they bowed out to Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. Goals from David Bentley, Matt Derbyshire and Roque Santa Cruz were enough to see off a much weakened Blues team.|$|E
25|$|In its 2016 Major League Soccer season opener, D.C. United {{started off}} {{well with a}} goal by {{newcomer}} Lamar Neagle to take a 1-0 lead over the LA Galaxy in the fifth minute. However, the Galaxy stormed <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half,</b> led by former MLS MVP Mike Magee, and crushed D.C. 4-1. As D.C. traveled to Foxboro to face the New England Revolution, Andrew Dykstra was forced to sit out with back spasms, and Fabian Espindola was nursing a tender hamstring. The match ended in a scoreless draw. Dykstra later turned out to need back surgery that would sideline him for 10–12 weeks, joining Hamid on the injury list and leaving the netminding duties up to sophomore keeper Travis Worra and the recently signed Horton.|$|E
50|$|He left City, now <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> Division, for Oxford United in October 1988 in a £200,000 deal, {{after making}} 155 {{appearances}} {{for them in}} total. He remained at Oxford for over four years - all spent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> tier - before signing for Derby County in February 1992 for £500,000.|$|R
50|$|At Orient, {{he joined}} another club playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Third Division South, and {{helped them to}} take <b>the</b> Division title <b>in</b> his first season with his new club. The {{following}} season, now <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> Division, Gregory only missed two league matches as Orient consolidated their position in mid-table.|$|R
50|$|Alioski {{began his}} club {{career as a}} left <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> team of BSC Young Boys where from 2010 to 2013 he scored four goals in 57 matches. In January 2013 he went to FC Schaffhausen on loan, later {{converting}} to a permanent transfer, scoring four goals in 77 matches.|$|R
25|$|On 3 December, Arsenal {{played at}} home with a tricky 1–0 win against Southampton, decided by a 89th minute Alexis Sánchez finish, his 13th goal in total for the club. Three days later, Arsenal played against Stoke City away from home and lost 3–2. Peter Crouch gave Stoke the lead after only 19 seconds of the match, Bojan doubled Stoke's lead and Jon Walters added a third before half time. Arsenal came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half.</b> Santi Cazorla scored from a penalty and Aaron Ramsey volleying in from a Santi Cazorla corner. Calum Chambers was sent off after getting a second yellow card and with ten men, Arsenal could not find an equalizer. Fans took their frustrations out on the team in a local subway, with several fans berating manager Arsene Wenger.|$|E
25|$|The 2011–12 season saw Everton get off {{to their}} now {{customary}} sluggish start, and were struggling in 16th place {{at the beginning of}} November. The turn of the year, and the signing of Nikica Jelavić from Rangers, saw fortunes improve dramatically, however. The club embarked on a sequence of only two defeats in 17 League and Cup matches, including wins over Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham. Everton also found themselves in an all-Merseyside FA Cup Semi-final for the right to play Tottenham or Chelsea in the final at Wembley. After taking the lead through a Jelavić goal, Everton were pegged <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> and conceded a late winner to end their Cup run for the season. This reverse not withstanding, it was Jelavić's goals (nine in 13 appearances since his transfer) that helped secure only four defeats in the last 24 league games, and a seventh-place finish, ahead of Liverpool {{for the first time in}} eight seasons.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} game of group stage, against Salgaocar, Bengaluru {{took the lead}} when Sunil Chhetri {{converted}} the penalty in 25th minute, but Salgaocar quickly equalized in 33rd minute. Chhetri again took the lead for Bengaluru when he converted a pass from Beikhokhei Beingaichho to a goal, but the Goan outfit again equalized in the 41st minute through a goal from Douhou Pierre. Just {{before the end of}} the first half, Sean Rooney scored the winner in 45th minute. In the second match against Mohun Bagan, both the teams had chances, but none of them could convert and the game ended in a 0–0 draw. Against Shillong Lajong, after a goal-less first half, Robin Singh, subbed-in at the half time and scored a 50th-minute winner. In the last group stage game against Pune, Chhetri scored a brace in the closing minutes of the first half. Pune pulled one <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> as Thongkhosiem Haokip scored in 87th minute, but ultimately Bengaluru won the encounter 1–2 and entered the semi-finals unbeaten and as the group winner.|$|E
50|$|The Gators {{defeated}} <b>The</b> Citadel 18-13 <b>in</b> a close game. Buie and Hester scored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first period. Citadel came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> quarter {{with a long}} {{pass from}} Weeks to Bolton. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> third quarter, Buie blocked a Citadel kick, leading to another touchdown. Another pass got Citadel's final touchdown.|$|R
