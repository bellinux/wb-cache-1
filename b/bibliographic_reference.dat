Efficiency of digitization has been increasing as library storage space has been diminishing, so more libraries are turning toward digitization not only to preserve materials in electronic formats, but also to save space. The open access movement is having an effect on music libraries, notably in subscription- or fee-based electronic services versus freely accessible electronic services.|$|E
5000|$|Definitions differ {{as to what}} {{constitutes}} a historical novel. On the one hand The Historical Novel Society defines the genre as works [...] "written at least fifty years after the events described", whilst {{on the other hand}} critic Sarah Johnson delineates such novels as [...] "set before the middle of the last 20th century … in which the author is writing from research rather than personal experience." [...] Then again Lynda Adamson, in her preface to the <b>bibliographic</b> <b>reference</b> work World Historical Fiction, states that while a [...] "generally accepted definition" [...] for the historical novel is a novel [...] "about a time period at least 25 years before it was written", she also suggests that some people read novels written in the past, like those of Jane Austen (1775-1817), as if they were historical novels.|$|E
50|$|The {{catalogue}} allocates {{a unique}} identifier to each print which {{is widely used}} as a <b>bibliographic</b> <b>reference</b> to specific caricatures in books about caricatures and in sales catalogues. The identifiers are one to five digit numbers, allocated in sequential order of listing within the whole sequence of volumes, each volume covering a monotonically increasing range of numbers. For example; BM Satires 10101 refers to a print listed in Volume VIII (which covers the range 9693 to 11703) that was published in September 1803 called My Ass in a Band Box. For each print, the catalogue provides a title, publisher, designer and creator if known, image description, lettering and inscriptions, dimensions, bibliographic references, and explanatory notes about the historical context and personages and printmaking technique (e.g. etching, aquatint, stipple, hand-coloured, etc.). The prints {{are for the most}} part in historical order of date of publication, though some appear out of chronological order in addenda that appear in later volumes. Within each year, Political and Social satire is arranged separately and sequentially.|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{repeated}} mistakes in <b>bibliographic</b> <b>references,</b> scientists are interested in reference managers. Currently, there are only few studies which concentrate on the quality evaluation of the <b>bibliographic</b> <b>references</b> generated by these applications. In this research, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>references</b> of online and printed articles, books, contributions to books and web resources generated from the Citace PRO, EndNote, Mendeley, RefWorks and Zotero reference managers with briefly made references according to the citation styles ACS, APA, ASA, ČSN ISO 690, JAMA, MLA and NLM were compared. During the comparison, {{it was found that}} no reference manager is able to generate all references in the correct way. The best results were detected in Mendeley which had the total fewest number of mistakes and the fewest number of mistakes for 3 citation styles and in Zotero which had the second total least number of mistakes and the total fewest number of mistakes for 4 citation styles. On the other hand, Citace PRO revealed the most mistakes for 5 citations style, EndNote for 2 citation styles and RefWorks for 1 citation style. All reference managers had problems with generating various data in <b>bibliographic</b> <b>references.</b> It was found that several mistakes were caused by the technical restrictions of the reference managers while other mistakes were caused by the wrong setting of the citation formats. With respect to similar functions of the tested reference managers and the number of mistakes in generated references, Zotero and Mendeley proved to be the most suitable managers...|$|R
