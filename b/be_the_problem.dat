25|$|Max asks Lofty to be {{his best}} man at his wedding to Zoe Hanna (Sunetra Sarker), which Lofty happily accepts. A fire breaks out at the wedding, leaving Zoe in danger. Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) saves her, but suffers a heartattack with Lofty {{treating}} him. Lofty struggles with Charlie's near-death experience and is infuriated by Charlie's heroism. When he returns from extended leave, Dylan assigns Lofty to assisting him, which surprises Lofty. When Lofty interferes with a patient's personal life, Dylan becomes frustrated but realises he could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> and compliments Lofty on his work. When he realises Dylan has nowhere to live, Lofty invites him and his dog Dervla to live with him, which annoys Robyn and Max. They urge him to tell Dylan to move out, but Lofty struggles and Robyn inadvertently tells him so Dylan moves into a houseboat. When senior staff nurse Jacob Masters (Charles Venn) shouts at Lofty, he becomes anxious around him and avoids him. Jacob later apologies to Lofty.|$|E

We present alternating logarithmic time algorithms for <b>the</b> tree isomorphism <b>problem,</b> <b>the</b> tree canonization <b>problem</b> and <b>the</b> tree comparison <b>problem.</b> As a consequence, there is a recursive enumeration of the alternating log time tree problems. ...|$|R

500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{was more}} {{critical}} of the episode, {{and gave it a}} D. He called the visual effects [...] "hilariously bad," [...] likening the CGI to [...] "a '90s computer game." [...] Sava added, [...] "As mediocre as the series has been, it was on a bit of an upswing with the last few episodes, but 'True North' is a big step backwards... The problem isn’t that these kids can’t act (although that might <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem),</b> it’s that the writing for their characters is horrible... This week’s episode is straight-up children’s television, and not in the way that it can be enjoyed by all ages. You need to be a child to suspend your disbelief long enough to watch 'True North.'" [...] Despite the critique, Sava did enjoy Caulfield's scenes, as well as Emma and Mary Margaret's conversation concerning motherhood. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Gwen Orel opined that the Hansel and Gretel [...] "parallel is clear and rather sweet, with touches of the ongoing story of Emma and Snow White, too." [...] Orel felt the episode seemed [...] "like a demented episode of Chopped," [...] and called the gingerbread house [...] "just like it should , colorful and candylike." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{review in}} the Independent Review, a {{quarterly}} academic journal, found the writing style to be [...] "well documented" [...] and [...] "analytical," [...] which exposed the [...] "thoroughly corrosive impact of beltway politics on democratic processes and citizen power." [...] The authors suggest that citizens, {{who used to be}} the [...] "backbone of the western state," [...] are no longer relevant. While government has grown, influential citizens have been reduced to recipients of government services and [...] "marginalized as political actors." [...] Government can raise an army and collect taxes without widespread public support; the withholding tax has made the voluntary component of tax paying less important; a professional military limits the need for citizen soldiers; special interests provide bureaucrats with a substitute for public support. The authors blame, in part, Progressive Era reforms such as primaries and recalls and referendums as weakening the parties' ability to mobilize voters. Neither party has much enthusiasm for mobilizing more voters. Group conflict dominates, and government {{is little more than a}} [...] "broker for competing interests." [...] Inside-the-Beltway regulatory agencies have a huge advantage over colleagues elsewhere. Ginsberg and Crenson think that increased litigation, caused by lowering the requirements for class-action lawsuits, works to the benefit of special interests who can cause changes beneficial to them without having to energize apathetic voters. The reviewer writes: [...] "the authors trace the civil rights, consumer, and environmental movements from their beginnings as popularly based struggles to the narrow group causes they have become today." [...] The reviewer suggested that the authors have [...] "acuity" [...] but neglected to consider that [...] "big government itself" [...] may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> The reviewer criticized the argument as having [...] "fallen short" [...] in some respects by focusing on non-elected public officials skilled at channeling power to special interests. The reviewer thinks elected officials still have incentives to mobilize wider publics and to act responsibly. But the reviewer concluded that American government might become [...] "a Frankenstein’s monster of exceptionally powerful officialdom with neither defined goals nor clear responsibility to the American public." ...|$|E
60|$|The supreme {{condition}} {{of success in}} a Communist revolution is {{that it should not}} paralyse industry. If industry is paralysed, the evils which exist in modern Russia, or others just as great, seem practically unavoidable. There will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of town and country, there will be hunger, there will be fierceness and revolts and military tyranny. All these things follow in a fatal sequence; and the end of them is almost certain to be something quite different from what genuine Communists desire.|$|E
