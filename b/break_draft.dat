40|$|In this paper，we {{examined}} the yarn irregularity {{by the change}} of draft division in 	the main and <b>break</b> <b>draft</b> zones. From the results，it is found that the <b>break</b> <b>draft</b> is 	necessary {{in order to reduce}} the periodic irregularity of yarns，and that better <b>break</b> 	<b>draft</b> ratio is from 1. 6 to 1. 8 ，under the experimental condition that total ratio is 20...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we used an {{experimental}} design {{to investigate the}} influence of the total draft, <b>break</b> <b>draft,</b> distance between the aprons (Clips) and production roller pressure on yarn quality in order to obtain optimum drafting conditions for polyester and viscose (PES/CV) blend yarns in ring spinning frame. We used PES fibers (1. 4 dtex × 38 mm long) and CV fibers (1. 6 dtex × 38 mm long) to spin a 20 Tex blend yarn of PES (70 %) /CV (30 %) blend ratio. When the <b>break</b> <b>draft,</b> adjustment of distance between of aprons and roller pressure is not reasonable, controlling and leading of the fibers is not sufficient for proper orientation of the fibers in the yarn structure to produce a high quality yarn. Experimental results and statistical analysis show that the best yarn quality will be obtained under drafting conditions total draft of 38, 1. 2 <b>break</b> <b>draft,</b> 2. 8 mm distance between of aprons and maximum pressure of the production top roller (18 daN) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} present {{research}} was to analyze the effect of draft, sliver hank and delivery speed {{on the quality of}} cotton yarn using different auto-leveller system at draw frame. Drawing is considered to be the key process in the whole set-up of yarn formation as all efficiency and quality of subsequent process depends upon the behavior of the sliver formed at drawing stage. In present research it is elaborated that during drawing, three factors are more important i. e. <b>break</b> <b>draft,</b> delivery speed and sliver hank. The best quality of yarn is obtained by controlling these factors. Rieter RSBD- 35 is better in performance as compared to Trutzschler HSR- 1000 which is efficient and modern autolevelling system with high speed servo drive motor at Rieter draw frame. The overall results show that moderate <b>break</b> <b>draft,</b> D 2 (1. 3), delivery speed S 2 (700 yards/min) and sliver hank H 2 (60 grain/yards) produced the better results...|$|E
50|$|The lead changed 53 times among 13 drivers. Parsons {{drafted into}} the lead with three laps to go; on the final lap he swung low to <b>break</b> the <b>draft,</b> but Waltrip, Labonte, and Petty drafted past on the high side; Parsons edged Petty while Labonte's last-second bid for the win fell short.|$|R
50|$|Roper's Championship debut came in 1996 against Antrim in Ballybofey, {{having made}} several {{appearances}} in the National Football League earlier that year. P.J.

40|$|It {{has been}} four months since Bob Carr {{resigned}} as premier of New South Wales. Some speculated that Carr’s retirement was a temporary <b>break</b> before a <b>draft</b> into the federal Labor leadership.

40|$|The author {{examines}} briefly {{the development}} of the cotton processing, in general, before studying the Casablancas high draft mechanism. After analyzing the draft between two pairs of cylinders and the short fibre control, the subject of this conference is exposed and special attention is paid to the <b>break</b> <b>draft</b> and the front draft zones. He explains the different criteria on the total draft in the Casablancas system as well as the varieties of the indicated system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{improve the}} yarn quality, the {{pressure}} bar {{was installed in}} the break drafting zone of the INA-V spinning frame. The process parameters were optimized in the break drafting zone with pressure bar of the INA-V spinning frame, the drafting principle in the break drafting zone with pressure bar of INA-V spinning frame was analyzed, and the sliver configuration was observed in the break drafting zone with pressure bar. The result revealed that installed the pressure bar in break drafting zone after, when the roving twist factor was small, CV%, thinness, thickness and neps of the yarn spun decrease as the break drafting ratio increase; when the twist factor of roving was larger, the <b>break</b> <b>draft</b> ratio as 1. 3 time was optimum drafting conditions. The yarn quality was improved as roving twist increased...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} work {{was carried out}} to develop the prediction models for blended ring spun yarn evenness and tensile parameters using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multiple linear regression (MLR). Polyester/cotton blend ratio, twist multiplier, back roller hardness and <b>break</b> <b>draft</b> ratio were used as input parameters to predict yarn evenness in terms of CVm% and yarn tensile properties in terms of tenacity and elongation. Feed forward neural networks with Bayesian regularisation support were successfully trained and tested using the available experimental data. The coefficients of determination of ANN and regression models indicate {{that there is a}} strong correlation between the measured and predicted yarn characteristics with an acceptable mean absolute error values. The comparative analysis of two modelling techniques shows that the ANNs perform better than the MLR models. The relative importance of input variables was determined using rank analysis through input saliency test on optimised ANN models and standardised coefficients of regression models. These models are suitable for yarn manufacturers and can be used within the investigated knowledge domain...|$|E
50|$|Winston 500 - The race lead changed 63 times among 11 drivers as Donnie Allison led over 70 laps. Richard Petty {{exploded}} from ninth to {{the lead on}} Lap Six but fell out on Lap 153 with engine failure. On the final lap Darrell Waltrip led with Allison second, Cale Yarborough third, and Benny Parsons fourth; Waltrip swung low in Turn Two to <b>break</b> the <b>draft,</b> and a mad scramble ensued where Cale rocketed to the high side in Three but was sideswiped by Waltrip and Parsons tried to shoot the gap; Cale edged Parsons for second as Waltrip broke away to the win.|$|R
50|$|While only {{fragments}} survive of some {{portions of}} the text, the papyrus containing the work of Anonymus Londinensis is exceptionally well preserved, with 3.5 meters of the roll largely intact, containing almost 2,000 lines of text in 39 columns. It {{seems to be an}} unfinished <b>draft</b> (<b>breaking</b> off in mid-column) in the hand of the author, who compiled, digested, and manipulated various sources as he wrote, so that we may even observe the process of his thinking as he writes.|$|R
50|$|The finish shook into an eleven-car battle; Bouchard {{ran out of}} gas {{with three}} laps to go and Labonte held the lead; his crew chief Dale Inman radioed Labonte {{to get out of the}} lead with two to go fearing a last-lap pass, but by this point Harry Gant had raced into {{contention}} and was battling Earnhardt and Baker for second. On the final lap Earnhardt broke free; Labonte swung low to try and <b>break</b> the <b>draft</b> and Earnhardt drafted past up high with Baker; Baker and Labonte got hung together battling for second and Earnhardt broke away to a ten-length win with Baker edging Labonte for second and Allison edging Yarborough for fourth. It was the first win for Earnhardt with the Childress team and tenth career win. Earnhardt also became the first driver to win the Talladega 500 in back to back seasons.|$|R

50|$|The goal of {{the group}} {{was to make a}} bold {{statement}} in opposition to the war in Vietnam by way of sabotaging the portion of the draft process that was administered through the local draft board in Camden. Their plan was to <b>break</b> into the <b>draft</b> board offices at night and search for, collect, and either destroy or remove the records of all Class 1-A status draft registrants. It was to be both a symbolic and real blow to the process through which tens of thousands of young American men were being drafted and sent to fight in Vietnam.|$|R
