25|$|A {{new view}} is {{developing}} that the regional tectonic boundary is not under Hood Canal, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> the west, involving the Saddle Mountain fault zone (discussed below) and associated faults.

In this view Hood Canal is only a syncline (dip) between the Olympic Mountains and the Puget Lowland, and such faults as have been found there are local and discontinuous, ancillary to the main zone of faulting to the west. North of the Seattle Fault accommodation of regional movement may be along the northwest-striking Dabob Bay Fault Zone.|$|E

[...] She next ran Mucho Macho Man in the other two legs of the Triple Crown, the 136th Preakness Stakes and the 143rd Belmont Stakes, where he finished sixth and seventh respectively. Only 13 women trainers had saddled a starter prior to the 2011 Preakness, and Ritvo was only the 10th woman trainer to start a horse in the Belmont. [...] Mucho Macho Man had overcome his own health problems in order to race, including having appeared to be lifeless at birth.

500|$|On April 26, 2016, Deadline {{reported}} that Aml Ameen abruptly left production {{a couple of}} episodes into filming of the second season over a conflict with Lana Wachowski that started during the table read for the season and progressively got worse. Both the Deadline article and Ameen's co-star on Sense8, Tuppence Middleton, suggested the conflict was over [...] When asked about it, Straczynski commented he was not there {{to know what happened}} between Ameen and Lana but he respects the choices of both. Subsequent to Ameen's departure, the role of Capheus was recast to Toby Onwumere after a seven-day auditioning process. Onwumere watched a few episodes of the show to prepare for his audition, as he had not seen it before. The actor said about his approach to the character: [...] "My duty [...] not to emulate exactly what [...] has done, ... <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> give it my own spin, and kind of do my own thing, and just give this character the same essence, but ... maybe a different life and a different take on it." [...] Earlier in April, Kick Gurry, who had played parts in the Wachowskis' Speed Racer and Jupiter Ascending in the past, revealed he had been cast in the second season, after Lana called to inform him that they had a written a role specifically for him. In May, Deadline reported Ben Cole had been cast as Todd, a sensate who would rather be [...] "normal". In September, Sylvester McCoy reportedly revealed he filmed three or four episodes of the second season of a Netflix show, later identified to be Sense8, and has signed to appear in further seasons if he is wanted. Martin Wuttke, who had minor roles in Cloud Atlas, also joined the cast in the second season.|$|E

A couple of years ago, Jack discovered his real father, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> avoid an argument, he hasn't told his mother that he knows her shameful sex secret." [...] The character Professor Milton Greene, Jack Donaghy's biological father, was played by guest actor Alan Alda, {{best known for his}} role as Hawkeye Pierce from the television series M*A*S*H. Alda and Alec Baldwin have worked together, having appeared in the 2004 biographical drama film The Aviator. This was Alda's third appearance on the show. After the airing of the season three finale episode [...] "Kidney Now!', in which Jack organizes a benefit concert to get Milton a kidney, it was unknown whether or not the benefit concert for Milton was a success, however, in the season four episode [...] "Into the Crevasse", Milton is shown to have written his book From Peanut to President, a biography of United States President Jimmy Carter. In this episode it is revealed that Jack sent Milton a kidney from British singer-songwriter Elvis Costello who participated in the benefit concert in [...] "Kidney Now!". In October 2010, it was confirmed that Alda would return as his 30 Rock character on the fifth season. In an interview with TV Guide, Alda said that he first met Elaine Stritch twenty years ago [...] "but never worked with her before. I always knew the reunion would be interesting. We kid with each other a lot, and our characters have a common enemy in their son." [...] This was Elaine Stritch's seventh appearance as Colleen Donaghy, Jack's mother, on the series.

2500|$|Author Michael Zager {{wrote that}} Pet Sounds resembles Spector's {{productions}} {{more than it}} does Rubber Soul, and that it recycles many of Spector's Wall of Sound production watermarks. Wilson talked of Spector's influence on his work, having learned how to produce records through attending his sessions, and in a 1988 interview, Wilson asserted that the album aspired to [...] "extend" [...] Spector's music, that [...] "in one sense of the word, we [...] were his messengers." [...] In Pet Sounds, Wilson sought to emulate Spector's Wall of Sound, driven by his fascination with [...] "combining one [...] to make another... It's amazing". Shortly before the album's release, Wilson spoke of recent popular music trends, saying [...] " [...] helped the Beach Boys evolve. We listen to what's happening and it affects what we do too. The trends have influenced my work, but so has my own scene." [...] In 1996, Wilson said of his partnership with Asher: [...] "none of us looked back... We went forward, kind of like on our own little wavelength. It wasn't like we were thinking, 'Okay, let's beat Spector,' let's out-do Motown.' It was more what I would call exclusive collaboration not to specifically try to kick somebody's butt, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> {{do it the way}} you really want it to be.

2500|$|Rush was {{interested}} in Native American health. He {{wanted to find out}} why Native Americans were susceptible to certain illnesses and whether they suffered from higher mortality rates as compared to civilized people. Other questions that he raised was whether or not they dreamed more or if their hair turned gray as they got older. His fascination with these people came from his interest in the theory that social scientists can better study the history of their own civilization by studying cultures in earlier states of development, [...] "primitive men". In his autobiography he writes [...] "From a review of the three different species of settlers, it appears that there are certain regular stages which mark the progress from the savage to civilized life. The first settler is nearly related to an Indian in his manners. In the second, the Indian manners are more diluted. It is in the third species only that we behold civilization completed. It is to the third species of settlers only that it is proper to apply the term of farmers. While we record the vices of the first and second settlers, it is <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> mention their virtues likewise. Their mutual wants produce mutual dependence; hence they are kind and friendly to each other. Their solitary situation makes visitors agreeable to them; hence they are hospitable to stranger." ...|$|E
