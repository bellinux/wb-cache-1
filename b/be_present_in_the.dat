5|$|Secondary structure: {{regularly}} repeating local structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds. The {{most common}} examples are the α-helix, β-sheet and turns.

5|$|A mosaic {{mutation}} {{may or may}} not be inheritable, {{depending on}} the cell populations affected. Though this is not always the case, genetic mutations can occur spontaneously in one sex cell of a parent during gametogenesis. In these cases, called germline mutations, the mutation will <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> single-celled zygote conceived from the affected sperm or egg cell, and the condition can be inherited by the next generation.|$|E

5|$|Although the Egyptians {{believed}} their gods to <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world around them, {{contact between the}} human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances.

5|$|High {{potassium}} levels {{tend to be}} {{a feature}} of severe rhabdomyolysis. Electrocardiography (ECG) may show whether the elevated potassium levels are affecting the conduction system of the heart, as suggested by the presence of T wave changes or broadening of the QRS complex. Low calcium levels may <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial stage due to binding of free calcium to damaged muscle cells.|$|E

5|$|Increased dietary {{selenium}} {{reduces the}} effects of mercury toxicity, although it is effective only at low to modest doses of mercury. Evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms of mercury toxicity includes the irreversible inhibition of selenoenzymes that are required to prevent and reverse oxidative damage in brain and endocrine tissues. An antioxidant, selenoneine, which is derived from selenium and {{has been found to}} <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood of bluefin tuna, is the subject of scientific research regarding its possible roles in inflammatory and chronic diseases, methylmercury detoxification, and oxidative damages.|$|E

Zinc is with 65 parts per million (ppm) the most abundant in the group while cadmium with 0.1 ppm and mercury with 0.08 ppm are orders of magnitude less abundant. Copernicium, as a synthetic element with a half-life of a few minutes, may only <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratories where it was produced.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Stegosaurus is uncertain, as few remains of basal stegosaurs and their {{ancestors}} are known. Recently, stegosaurids {{have been shown}} to <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower Morrison Formation, existing several million years before the occurrence of Stegosaurus itself, with the discovery of the related Hesperosaurus from the early Kimmeridgian. The earliest stegosaurid (the genus Lexovisaurus) is known from the Oxford Clay Formation of England and France, giving it an age of early to middle Callovian.|$|E
5|$|This {{development}} greatly facilitated {{vaccine research}} and ultimately {{allowed for the}} development of vaccines against polio. Enders and his colleagues, Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins, were recognized in 1954 for their labors with a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Other important advances that {{led to the development of}} polio vaccines were: the identification of three poliovirus serotypes (Poliovirus type 1 — PV1, or Mahoney; PV2, Lansing; and PV3, Leon); the finding that prior to paralysis, the virus must <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood; and the demonstration that administration of antibodies in the form of gamma globulin protects against paralytic polio.|$|E

5|$|Tripathi {{started writing}} The Secret of the Nagas {{while the first}} part of the trilogy was being released. He relied on his {{knowledge}} of geography and history to expand the locations visited in the story. The book was released on 12 August 2011, and was published by Westland Press. Before its release, the author confessed that many revelations would <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book, including the true nature of many characters. Two theatrical trailers were created for showing in multiplex cinema halls, as Tripathi believed that the film-going audience also reads his books, and that would create publicity.|$|E
5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E
5|$|Australia had {{previously}} won {{medals in the}} event, but was not {{regarded as one of}} the favourites for the gold, as the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden all fielded more decorated swimmers over the component legs of the relay. After the backstroke leg, Australia was in fourth place and more than a second in arrears of the Soviet leaders. However, Evans was the fastest among the breaststrokers and moved the team into second position at the halfway point in the race; and Tonelli, a makeshift butterflyer, completed his leg in a time much faster than his previous best, allowing Australia to keep the Soviet lead reasonable. Australia's anchor swimmer Brooks overtook his more credentialled Soviet counterpart Sergey Koplyakov in the latter half of the final leg to secure a narrow victory. The quartet disbanded after the Olympics due to Tonelli's retirement, although some of the members continued to <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relay team at various times alongside new swimmers. By 1986, all four members of the 1980 team had retired from international competition.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Christianity through the tenth century, Christian theologians saw the Eucharist as the church's participation in Christ's sacrifice. Christ was believed to <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eucharist, but there were differences over {{the way in which}} this occurred. The School of Antioch in the Eastern Roman Empire, along with Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose in the Western Roman Empire, taught a realist, metabolic, or somatic view, where the elements of the Eucharist were believed to be changed into Christ's body and blood. The influential fourth-century Western theologian Augustine of Hippo, on the other hand, held that Christ is really present in the elements of the Eucharist, but not in a bodily manner, because his body remains in heaven. Augustine believed the Eucharist is a spiritual eating which allows Christians to become part of Christ's body. Western theologians in the three centuries following Augustine did not elaborate on the way Christ is present in the Eucharist, but emphasized the transforming power of the sacrament.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.|$|E
5|$|Plutarch {{mentions}} that the Athenians saw the phantom of King Theseus, the mythical hero of Athens, leading {{the army in}} full battle gear in the charge against the Persians, and indeed he was depicted in the mural of the Stoa Poikile fighting for the Athenians, along with the twelve Olympian gods and other heroes. Pausanias also tells us that: They say too that there chanced to <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely ordered them to honor Echetlaeus ("he of the Plough-tail") as a hero.|$|E
