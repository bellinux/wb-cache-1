5000|$|The Kauffman-White {{classification}} scheme {{is the basis}} for naming the manifold serovars of Salmonella. To date, more than 2600 different serotypes have been identified. A Salmonella serotype is determined by the unique combination of reactions of cell surface antigens. The [...] "O" [...] antigen is determined by the outermost portion of the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the [...] "H" [...] antigen is based on the flagellar (protein) antigens. There are two species of Salmonella: Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica. Salmonella enterica can be subdivided into six subspecies.The process to identify the serovar of the bacterium consists of finding the formula of cell antigens which represent the variations of the bacteria. First of all, the use of the agglutination method on slides is required {{in order to get the}} antigen formula. The agglutination between the antigen and the antibody is made with a specific antisera, which reacts with the antigen to produce a mass. The antigen O is tested with a <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspension</b> from an agar plate whereas the antigen H is tested with a <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspension</b> from a broth culture. The scheme is used to classify the serovar depending on its antigen formula obtained with the reaction of the agglutination.|$|E
50|$|API {{test strips}} {{consists}} of wells containing dehydrated substrates to detect enzymatic activity, usually related to fermentation of carbohydrate or catabolism of proteins or amino acids by the inoculated organisms. A <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspension</b> {{is used to}} rehydrate each of the wells and the strips are incubated.

For example, when carbohydrates are fermented, the pH within the well decreases and that change is indicated by a change in the color of the pH indicator. All positive and negative test results are compiled to obtain a profile number, which is then compared with profile numbers in a commercial codebook (or online) to determine the identification of the bacterial species.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{research}} in the area of sustainable energy is investigating the application and design of microbial fuel cells (MFC) using R. ferrireducens. In an MFC, a <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspension</b> is provided a reduced compound, which the bacteria use as a source of electrons. The bacteria metabolize this compound and shuttle the released electrons through their respiratory networks and ultimately donate them to a synthetic electron acceptor, also known as an anode. When connected to a cathode, the bacterial metabolism of the reduced compound generates electricity and CO2. The advantage of MFCs over conventional electricity generation is the direct conversion of chemical energy into electricity, improving energy conversion efficiency. A unique feature of using R. ferrireducens over other bacteria is that many other bacteria require the addition of a mediator to shuttle the electrons from the bacterial cells to the anode. For R. ferrireducens, through an unknown membrane protein, electrons are directly shuttled from the membrane to the anode.|$|E

50|$|Molecular {{biological}} methods for bioaerosol are significantly {{faster and more}} sensitive than conventional culture-based methods, and they are also able to reveal a larger diversity of microbes. Targeting the variation in the 16S rRNA gene, a microarray (PhyloChip) was used to conduct comprehensive identification of both bacterial and archaeal organisms in bioaerosols. New U.S. EPA methods {{have been developed to}} utilize qPCR to characterize indoor environment for fungal spores. In a study by Lange et al., FISH method successfully identified eubacteria in samples of complex native bioaerosols in swine barns. Nonetheless, molecular biological tools have limitations. Since PCR methods target DNA, viability of cells could not be confirmed in some cases. When qPCR technique is used for bioaerosol detection, standard curves need to be developed to calibrate final results. One study indicated that “curves used for quantification by qPCR needs to be prepared using the same environmental matrix and procedures as handling of the environmental sample in question” and that “reliance on the standard curves generated with cultured <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspension</b> (a traditional approach) may lead to substantial underestimation of microorganism quantities in environmental samples”. Microarray techniques also face the challenge of natural sequence diversity and potential cross-hybridization in complex environmental bioaerosols).|$|E

In one particular experiment published in the same article, Stroun and his group extracted the auricles of frog hearts and dipped them for several hours in a suspension of bacteria. Afterward, they found a high percentage of RNA-DNA hybridization between bacterial DNA extracted from bacteria of the same species as that used in the experiment and titrated DNA extracted from the auricles which had been dipped in the <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspension.</b> The experiment demonstrated that bacterial DNA had been absorbed by the animal cells.

40|$|Abstract. The {{study of}} {{collective}} motion in <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspensions</b> {{has been of}} significant recent interest. To better understand the non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations emerging {{in the course of}} collective swimming in suspensions of motile bacteria, a simple model is employed: a bacterium is represented as a force dipole with size, {{through the use of a}} short-range repelling potential, and shape. The model emphasizes two fundamental mechanisms: dipolar hydrodynamic interactions and short-range bacterial collisions. Using direct particle simulations validated by a dedicated experiment, we show that changing the swimming speed or concentration alters the time scale of sustained collective motion, consistent with experiment. Also, the correlation length in the collective state is almost constant as concentration and swimming speed change even though increasing each greatly increases the input of energy to the system. We demonstrate that the particle shape is critical for the onset of collective effects. In addition, new experimental results are presented illustrating the onset of collective motion with an ultrasound technique. This work exemplifies the delicate balance between various physical mechanisms governing collective motion in <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspensions</b> and provides important insights into its mesoscopic nature.

Inoculation of <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspension</b> and antifungal protein prior to M. fructicola gave a better biocontrol effect, and the higher concentrations of bacterial (1 × 1010 cfu · mL− 1) and antifungal protein (3. 0 mg · mL− 1) performed better control effects. The environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, affected biocontrol effects of W 10 <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspension</b> and antifungal protein. The influence of environment conditions on the activity of antifungal protein was less than that on <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspension.</b> Moreover, lower temperature (4 °C) and relative humidity (RH 70 %– 75 %) were favorable to prevent peach brown rot by W 10 <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspension</b> and its antifungal protein. The W 10 <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspension</b> and antifungal protein amended with calcium [0. 1 % Ca(NO 3) 2] could enhance the biocontrol effects, and obviously put off the occurrence of peach brown rot.

Moreover, both W 10 <b>bacterial</b> <b>suspension</b> and antifungal protein treatments did not have effects on external and internal fruit appearance, such as chromatic aberration parameter L* of flesh, flesh firmness, soluble solids content and weight loss.
