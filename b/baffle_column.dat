40|$|The {{oscillating}} <b>baffle</b> <b>column</b> presently described {{was invented}} by Dr. W. J. Thomas. It is a differentially operating continuous counter-current extractor. The experimental work is concerned with establishing {{the efficiency of the}} extractor under different conditions of operation up to the flooding point. Oscillating speeds and liquid flow rates were varied while other parameters were maintained constant. A direct comparison with the efficiency of operation of a Rotating Disc Contactor was made by carrying out the identical experiments in each case. The general differential equations for the extract and raf-finate phases in a differential contactor model have been derived by several methods. The relationship between the sign of each term in the differential equation and the direction of phase flow has been considered. The overall mass transfer coefficient in the extract phase, ka, has been measured along the column. It was found that a reversal in the trend in ka occurs depending on the speed of oscillation. At low oscillating speed ka is larger {{at the bottom of the}} column than the top and at high oscillating speeds the reverse is true. Three methods of calculating the longitudinal mixing coefficient from experimental data have been employed. The method using integration by parts is considered to be the most accurate and reliable. A dye injection technique was used to experimentally determine the C curve for different operating conditions for the Oscillating Baffle and the Rotating Disc Columns. A gamma function was used to relate the C curve to the variance and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{is known}} to play an {{important}} role in particle-bubble contacting in flotation. This thesis investigates the effect of energy input (or agitation) on the flotation kinetics of quartz in a novel oscillating grid flotation cell. The effects of bubble size and particle size have been recognized as important variables affecting particle-bubble contacting in turbulent systems and are investigated in this thesis. The research work done in this thesis is a continuation of the work done by the Centre for Minerals Research by Deglon (1998) who investigated the effects of energy in a batch mechanical flotation cell. However, this system has a very complex hydrodynamic environment, resulting from the large disparities in turbulence intensity. Previously Breytenbach (1995) had constructed a hybrid flotation column cell, which was essentially a column flotation cell that could be modified into a Jameson cell or a mechanically agitated column cell. He used this to compare particle collection efficiency in these different particle-bubble contacting environments. The third phase of the work was the oscillating <b>baffle</b> <b>column</b> (OBC), a novel flotation column that attains agitation by oscillating a set of orifice baffles through the slurry, thereby producing a more uniform shear rate distribution than would be obtained in an impeller driven system (Anderson, 2008). The OBC unfortunately has significant oscillatory flow and has high shear rates, which often result in detachment effects becoming appreciable. Oscillating grids generate near ideal hydrodynamic environments, characterised by turbulence that is relatively homogeneous and isotropic. The oscillating grid flotation cell used in this study was based on the oscillatory multi-grid mixer used by Bache and Rasool (2001). The oscillatory multi-grid mixer was purchased from these authors and retrofitted to produce the oscillating grid flotation cell. The novel oscillating grid cell consists of a 10 litre tank agitated by 19 grids with a mesh size of 8 mm and grid spacing of 18 mm. The grids were oscillated at a fixed amplitude, equal to the grid spacing, and over a range of frequencies, using a variable speed drive. Frother was added at 100 ppm to be consistent with the work of Deglon (2002) and Ahmed and Jameson (1985). A low gas flow-rate (100 ml/min) and solids concentration were specifically chosen in order that there was minimal influence on the structure of turbulence in the oscillating grid cell, as Bache and Rasool (2001) took measurements in water. Flotation tests were performed on methylated quartz particles (P 80 = 100 Î¼m) over a range of power intensities (0. 015 â€“ 0. 60 W/kg) and using three different bubble sizes, generated by sintered glass discs (0. 13, 0. 24 and 0. 82 mm). The flotation rate constant was found to increase approximately linearly with increasing particle size for all three bubble sizes. This was due to the increased probability of collision for larger particles and is well established in the flotation literature. A number of researchers have found that the flotation rate constant for quartz particles increases almost linearly with particle size, at low power intensities. An inverse power relationship was observed between bubble size and flotation rate constant for all fine, middling and coarse particle size ranges. This inverse power relationship was due to the increased probability of collision for smaller bubbles and is also well established in the flotation literature. More significantly, the flotation rate constant was found to increase almost linearly with increasing power intensity for all particle and bubble sizes used in this study. The majority of theoretical and experimental studies have found energy input to have less of an effect than the proportional/linear dependence observed in this study. In addition, the increase in the flotation rate constant with increasing power intensity was observed to depend on particle size, but to be less dependent on bubble size. These findings suggest that energy input and bubble size may respectively play more and less of a role in promoting particle-bubble contacting in turbulent environments than was noted in the flotation literature. However, a recent study by Newell and Grano (2006) done using a stirred tank also noted this linear dependence. Given the findings of this thesis, it is strongly recommended that further work be done to investigate the OGC at higher energy intensities (~ 3 W/kg) and to scale it up so that it can be more comparable to the widely used mechanical flotation cells. The homogeneous and nearly isotropic turbulence generated by the OGC also makes it an ideal environment to characterize floatability for different ores...|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{experimental study}} of gas-liquid contacting in an oscillatory <b>baffled</b> <b>column</b> is presented focusing {{on the effect of}} fluid oscillation on gas holdup and bubble size. The results show that beyond a critical level of fluid oscillation the Sauter mean diameter of the dispersion is substantially reduced, while the gas holdup (and, thus, the residence time of the gas phase) increases significantly. The reduction of bubble size was described in terms of bubble breakage, caused by the interaction of the bubbles with eddies. The experimental results were modeled by applying Kolmogoroff’s theory of isotropic turbulence. The steep increase in the gas holdup with oscillation was mainly due to bubble entrainment by large vortices, formed by the oscillatory flow in the presence of baffles. A semi-theoretical expression, based on the forces acting on a bubble, was proposed, and was able to accurately match the experimental trends.

Bubble pipe reactor with inclined baffle is expected to reduce the problem from gas flow patterns, jagged sloping bulkhead serves as a bubble breaker that could replace mechanical stirrer. In this study the reactor column sloping bulkhead was used as extractor to recover pectin in the cocoa peel by citric acid (1 N) solvent. Cocoa peel paste and citric acid were entered {{to the top of}} the column at 1 : 1 rate ratio by streamed using dosing pump.

40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{investigating the}} fluid mixing in oscillatory <b>baffled</b> <b>columns</b> (OBC), by utilising ANSYS CFX 15 under single and two-phase (gas-liquid) flow conditions. The thesis {{consists of two}} major parts, {{and in the first}} part, the primary focus was to find a suitable model to describe fluid flow in an OBC. Several models were considered, and the results validated using literature results. The preferred turbulence model for OBCs was found to be the shear stress transport (SST) model. The effect of operational conditions on mixing needs to be evaluated for improving OBC performance. Presently, the evaluation of mixing was mainly done by the calculation of velocity ratio, which was questionable. Hence, a variable, mass concentration was introduced successfully to assess the mixing associated with oscillating flow patterns. This parameter was then applied to a pipe flow where velocity ratio method had been unsuccessful. Using the preferred turbulence model, the effects of operational variables and simultaneous oscillations of the flow and baffles were investigated for a single phase flow. Simulations showed that the overall turbulence increased for two-oscillation sources, but the power consumption increased. In the second part, the numerical modelling was carried out for gas-liquid flows in an OBC using computational fluid dynamics, related to which gaps of knowledge can be found in literature, particularly in relation to the effects of amplitude variation and aeration rate at a constant frequency. The gas hold-up, magnitude difference between the maximum and minimum velocities, as well as the mean bubble velocity were obtained, which showed good agreement with experimental results. The fine bubble generation was also attempted. Effects of three major variables, oscillation frequency and amplitude and aeration rate were investigated, and the results compared with literature results. At low aeration rate, a single-hole sparger produced very small bubbles accompanied by very large bubbles. At a high oscillation frequency and amplitude, small bubbles were accompanied by a large tail of air, which was smaller in volume compared to the total bubble volume. The results showed that the developed numerical models can produce reliable results in single and two-phase (gas-liquid) systems...|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 200 - 212). This thesis {{presents an}} evaluation of an Oscillatory <b>Baffled</b> <b>Column</b> as a novel flotation device and as a research tool for investigating the role which hydrodynamics play in promoting particle-bubble contacting. The cell differs from a conventional cell design in that bubble generation is decoupled from the power input. This allows the hydrodynamic environment to be optimised for effective particlebubble contacting. The design also incorporates a novel mechanism of agitation which provides a more even distribution of shear rate than would be obtained in a stirred system and allows considerably more variation of the power input to the cell. Based on these properties it is hypothesised that the OBC would provide an effective hydrodynamic environment for fine particle flotation, particularly in highly viscous, non-Newtonian slurries. It is also hypothesised {{that the development of}} such a cell technology will facilitate an improved understanding of the role which hydrodynamics play in promoting particle-bubble contacting. To investigate these hypotheses, the OBC was first characterised in terms of key flotation parameters, such as bubble size, gas hold-up and mixing. The cell was then flotation tested on quartz, in order to benchmark the study against previous studies on hydrodynamics and particle-bubble contacting in stirred systems. Finally, the OBC was tested in application to a highly viscous, non-Newtonian nickel ore slimes slurry which is difficult to treat using conventional cell technologies. This study gave context to the potential future role of OBC technology in the minerals processing industry. The results of this thesis clearly show that the OBC is a promising novel technology for the treatment of fine mineral slurries. The cell has been demonstrated to significantly improve flotation kinetics by a factor of between 1. 4 and 1. 6 relative to a standard column. Optimal flotation conditions were obtained at power dissipations as low as 10 W/m 3. The advantages of the OBC as a novel device include its ability to decouple bubble generation and particle-bubble contacting, its even distribution of shear rate in the cell as well as the additional fluctuating fluid motion produced under oscillatory flow. Furthermore, the flotation kinetics in the cell were shown to be unaffected by slurry rheology indicating the cell is best suited to niche application in the processing of ore types exhibiting highly viscous non-Newtonian behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Problems {{related to}} {{crystallisation}} and deposition of paraffin waxes on oil pipelines during production and transportation {{of crude oil}} caused huge operational and financial losses to petroleum industry. This study {{is focused on the}} fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of wax deposition and investigates the effect of several major parameters on such deposition in a batch oscillatory <b>baffled</b> <b>column</b> (OBC). The OBC is a relatively new mixing technology and offers more unifoml mixing and particle suspension than traditional reactors. It is the intention of this work to characterise the effect of oscillatory mixing on the wax deposition process perhaps as an alternative way for mitigation of wax deposition pro. blems. Experiments have be~n carried out {{to examine the effects of}} aBC's operational parameters, wax-oil volume, paraffin wax content, carbon number of the solvents, baffles materials and structure on the wax deposition. Analyses conducted to evaluate and characterise the wax deposition are: the percentage of waX deposition (8, wt. %); the Avrami exponent (n) which c 0 l!esponds to the type of wax crystals; and the half time of deposition (tl/ 2) which is associated with the rateof deposition. On the study ofthe effect of OBC's parameters, it was found that increasing the oscillation frequency and amplitude reduced the overall deposition; baffles oscillation altered the type of wax crystal formed from needle type to clustered plate-like shapes; and accelerated the rates of deposition. On the effect of wax-oil volume, it was observed that increasing the volume reduced the deposition, increased n values and tlfl hence reduced the deposition rates. The study on the effect of paraffin wax content revealed that increasing the wax content increased the deposition, reduced n values and caused higher crystallisation rates. On the effect of solvent carbon numbers, it was found that the higher the carbon numbers, the more the deposition, lower n and t 1 / 2. Lastly on the study of baffles materials and structure, it can be deduced that using different baffles materials had no significant impact on the deposition in the OBC. In summary, oscillatory baffled flow can be an effective means of mitigation of wax deposition problems. This work may also lead to a screening test for wax deposition inhibitors. Since the deposition of viscous materials is common to other sectors of the process industries, the results of this study will provide essential information for understanding and perhaps later implementation of the OBC technology in the related fieldsEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has focused}} on the {{measurement}} of gas holdup in flotation systems, a variable not measured reliably to date. A sensor was designed using so-called flow conductivity cells. Their properties were studied and modelled, and their application in the design, construction, and operation of a gas holdup probe for use in flotation systems described. A flow cell is defined as one that allows a fluid or dispersion to flow through freely while the electrical conductivity is measured. One of the most important features of a flow cell is the so-called cell constant. Once the cell constant is determined, the cell can be used to measure liquid and dispersion conductivity. The cell constant depends mainly on cell dimensions, and is largely independent of the characteristics of the fluid. The addition of non conductive bodies to the fluid was studied. It was concluded that the cell constant is not affected by the presence of such bodies. These systems are described by Maxwell's model, which relates the fraction of non conductive phase (holdup) in the system to the conductivity of the continuous phase and the conductivity of the dispersion. It was demonstrated that the electromagnetic field associated with the flow cells can be solved using the MagNet 5. 1 software. Predicted results for cell constant were in good agreement with the experimental. The model holds the potential for design of flow cells for particular applications in mineral processing. The gas holdup probe developed in this work applies the principle of separation of phases to fulfill the requirements of Maxwell's model. The probe consists of two flow cells. One, the open flow cell, measures the conductivity of the dispersion while the other, the syphon cell, measures the continuum conductivity. The test work, in both laboratory and industrial flotation columns, demonstrated that the probe gave accurate estimates of gas holdup. The probe satisfied the requirements of an industrial sensor, as it performs in-situ, on-line, in real-time, with no external measurements and no assumptions regarding properties of any phase. The gas holdup probe was used to explore operating flotation columns. It appears to hold great promise for diagnosis, readily detecting, for example, differences in gas holdup between sections of <b>baffled</b> <b>columns.</b> This success may make the probe a candidate sensor for process control, although this will require a significant in-plant effort to realize.
