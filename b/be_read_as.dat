5|$|Aronofsky {{is known}} for his {{environmental}} activism. A number of his films, notably Noah and mother!, can <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> environmental parables. In 2014, he traveled to the Alberta Tar Sands with the Sierra Club's Michael Brune and Leonardo DiCaprio. In 2015, he traveled to Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge with Brune, Keri Russell, and the leaders of several veterans groups.|$|E
5|$|Tennyson {{originally}} {{blocked out}} the poem in four paragraphs, broken before lines 6, 33 and 44. In this structure, {{the first and}} third paragraphs are thematically parallel, but may <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> interior and exterior monologues, respectively. However, the poem is often printed with the first paragraph break omitted.|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi {{was ready}} now for an {{offensive}}. The decisive offensive began in June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invested Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba and Ab√©ch√©, assuming {{control of the}} main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, while helping with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only committed a few thousand regular troops to the offensive, {{and most of these}} were artillery and logistic units. This may have been due to Gaddafi's desire that the conflict <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a Chadian internal affair.|$|E

5|$|Historia Plantarum {{was written}} some time between c. 350 BC and c. 287 BC in ten volumes, of which nine survive. In the book, Theophrastus {{described}} plants by their uses, and attempted a biological classification {{based on how}} plants reproduced, a first {{in the history of}} botany. He continually revised the manuscript, and it remained in an unfinished state on his death. The condensed style of the text, with its many lists of examples, indicate that Theophrastus used the manuscript as the working notes for lectures to his students, rather than intending it to <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a book.|$|E
5|$|Laozi is {{traditionally}} {{regarded as the}} author of the Daodejing (Tao Te Ching), though the identity of its author(s) or compiler(s) has been debated throughout history. It {{is one of the most}} significant treatises in Chinese cosmogony. As with most other ancient Chinese philosophers, Laozi often explains his ideas by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. In fact, the whole book can <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> an analogy ‚Äì the ruler is the awareness, or self, in meditation and the myriad creatures or empire is the experience of the body, senses and desires.|$|E
5|$|Sir John Tenniel drew {{a famous}} {{illustration}} of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, c. 1865. The caterpillar is {{seated on a}} toadstool and is smoking a hookah; the image can <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> showing either the forelegs of the larva, or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin. Eric Carle's children's book The Very Hungry Caterpillar portrays the larva as an extraordinarily hungry animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and {{the days of the}} week.|$|E

More recently as recorded in the 18th century, the Taoist master Liu Yiming continued to advocate this usage.|$|E
5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot be conceived not to exist. He argued that if something can be conceived not to exist, then something greater can be conceived. Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot be conceived not to exist and so it must exist. This can <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|E
5|$|Trollope leapt {{into the}} fray {{somewhat}} belatedly, {{in the pages of}} Saint Paul's in October 1869, with an article on the Formosa controversy that can <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a defence of and an advertisement for The Vicar. He took exception to several of the arguments in The Times: young women of the 1860s, he wrote, were not unaware of the existence of prostitution; and attempting to keep them in ignorance would not conduce to virtue. Rather than promoting vice, an accurate depiction of the squalid and miserable life of a woman of the streets would arm young people to resist temptation.|$|E

2500|$|Deep {{dyslexia}} {{is mainly}} {{characterized by the}} occurrence of semantic reading errors or semantic paralexias (transposition of letters or words) when reading aloud (e.g. the written word [...] "view" [...] <b>is</b> <b>read</b> aloud <b>as</b> [...] "scene", the word [...] "bird" [...] <b>is</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> [...] "canary"). These semantic errors are the major distinguishing feature of deep dyslexia in comparison to other central dyslexias. There are many other symptoms of deep dyslexia, including visual errors (e.g. the written word [...] "thing" [...] <b>is</b> <b>read</b> aloud <b>as</b> [...] "think", the word [...] "skate" [...] <b>is</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> [...] "scale") and derivational errors (e.g. the written word [...] "alcohol" [...] <b>is</b> <b>read</b> aloud <b>as</b> [...] "alcoholic", the word [...] "governor" [...] <b>is</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> [...] "government"), and poor reading of function words. Additionally, deep dyslexics have more difficulty reading abstract than concrete and highly imaginable words, more difficulty reading adjectives, adverbs, and verbs than nouns, a complete inability to read non-words, and often impairments on tasks of verbal working memory.|$|R
5|$|CreangƒÉ {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since CreangƒÉ explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a banishment in perpetuity), CreangƒÉ considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.|$|E
5|$|His poem Hugh Selwyn Mauberley {{consists}} of 18 short parts, and describes a poet whose life has become sterile and meaningless. Published in June 1920, it marked his farewell to London. He was disgusted by the massive {{loss of life}} {{during the war and}} was unable to reconcile himself with it. Stephen J. Adams writes that, just as Eliot denied he was Prufrock, so Pound denied he was Mauberley, but the work can nevertheless <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> autobiographical. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene, before turning to social criticism, economics, and an attack on the causes of the war; here the word usury appears in his work for the first time. The critic F. R. Leavis saw the poem as Pound's major achievement.|$|E
5|$|Rebellion {{broke out}} in late June 1848, after FrƒÉ»õias members came to adopt a single project {{regarding}} the promise of land reform. This resolution, which had initially caused dissension, was passed into the revolutionary program upon pressures from Nicolae BƒÉlcescu and his supporters. The document itself, destined to <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a proclamation, was most likely drafted by Heliade RƒÉdulescu, and BƒÉlcescu himself was possibly {{responsible for most of}} its ideas. It called for, among other issues, national independence, civil rights and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, responsible government, a five-year term of office for Princes and their election by the Assembly, freedom of the press, and decentralization.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{produced}} art {{to serve}} functional purposes. For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were {{developed during the}} Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change. These artistic standards‚Äîsimple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth‚Äîcreated a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The Narmer Palette, for example, displays figures that can also <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> hieroglyphs. Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men might be too tired to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men {{would have none of it}} and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it seems unlikely that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of hours spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Latin American {{novels that}} explore {{political}} themes, but {{that do not}} centre upon the rule of a particular dictator, are informally classified as ‚Äúnot quite dictator novels‚Äù. For example, Libro de Manuel (A Manual for Manuel, 1973), by Julio Cort√°zar, is a postmodern novel about urban guerrillas and their revolutionary struggle, which asks the reader to examine the broader societal matters of language, sexuality, and the modes of interpretation. In the Time of the Butterflies (1994), by Julia √Ålvarez, {{tells the story of}} the Mirabal sisters, whom patriotism transformed from well-behaved Catholic d√©butantes to political dissenters against the thirty-year dictatorship of the Trujillo r√©gime in the Dominican Republic. The novel sought to illuminate the officially-obscured-history of the deaths of the Mirabal sisters, not to determine what happened to them, but to determine how the Mirabal sisters happened to the national politics of the Dominican Republic. In the mock-diary ‚ÄúIntimate Diary of Solitude‚Äù (third part of El imperio de los sue√±os 1988; Empire of Dreams, 1994), by Giannina Braschi, the protagonist is Mariquita Samper, the diarist who shoots the narrator of the Latin American Boom in revolt against his dictatorial control of the fictional narration. Moreover, in Braschi‚Äôs most recent work ‚ÄúUnited States of Banana‚Äù (2011), the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo overthrows his father, the King of the United States of Banana, who had imprisoned him for more than a hundred years in the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty, for the crime of having been born. The story of Distant Star (1996), by Roberto Bola√±o, begins on 11 September 1973, with the coup d‚Äô√©tat by General Augusto Pinochet against Salvador Allende, the President of Chile. The writer and professor of literature Raymond Leslie Williams describes the aforementioned novels as not-quite-dictator-novels, which are reminiscent of the genre for being ‚Äúacutely and subtly political fiction‚Äù that addresses themes different from those of the dictator novel, which cannot be divorced from the politics of the stories, and so each ‚Äúcan <b>be</b> <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a meditation on the horror of absolute power‚Äù.|$|E
