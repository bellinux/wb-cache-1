5|$|Romanticism {{has also}} been seen as {{affecting}} scientific enquiry. Romantic attitudes to science varied, from distrust of the scientific enterprise to endorsing a non-mechanical science that rejected the mathematicised and the abstract theorising associated with Newton. Major trends in continental science associated with Romanticism include Naturphilosophie, developed by Friedrich Schelling (1775–1854), which focused on the necessity of reuniting man with nature, and Humboldtian science, {{based on the work}} of Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859). As defined <b>by</b> <b>Susan</b> Cannon, this form of inquiry placed a stress on observation, accurate scientific instruments and new conceptual tools; disregarded the boundaries between different disciplines; and emphasised working in nature rather than the artificial laboratory. Privileging observation above calculation, Romantic scientists were often attracted to the areas where investigation, rather than calculation and theory, was most important, particularly the life sciences, geology, optics and astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Sociology of literature, film, and art is {{a subset}} of the {{sociology}} of culture. This field studies the social production of artistic objects and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire, translated <b>by</b> <b>Susan</b> Emanuel as Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field (1996). None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.|$|E

5|$|The five {{previous}} {{series of}} One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed <b>by</b> <b>Susan</b> Belbin. She had retired because of ill health. Renwick persuaded her {{to return to}} work on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again. The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as on other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, My World {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who complimented its production. It debuted at number six on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 137,000 copies. In doing so, {{it became the}} strongest-debuting release for a new artist in 2009, though it was topped the following week by I Dreamed a Dream <b>by</b> <b>Susan</b> Boyle, which moved 701,000 units. Upon the release of My World 2.0 in March 2010, its predecessor peaked at number five. Less than two months after its release, the record was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales exceeding one million copies. Internationally, the extended play attained similar success. It debuted atop the Canadian Albums Chart, where it was later certified double platinum. It additionally attained double platinum recognition in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|During Grant's {{presidency}} {{the early}} Women's suffrage movement led <b>by</b> <b>Susan</b> B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention. Anthony lobbied for female suffrage, equal gender pay, {{and protection of}} property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869, Grant signed into law the protection of married women's property from their husbands' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill, coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood, that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work. Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law. The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary, however, lower tiered female clerks were exempted. The law increased women's clerk salaries from 4% to 20% during the 1870s, however, the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued. The Republicans, who needed women to campaign for Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election, added to their platform open discussion of women's rights.|$|E
