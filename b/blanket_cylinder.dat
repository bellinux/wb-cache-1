Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a rubber blanket, which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinder</b> and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper.

Actual squeeze between plate and <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinder</b> is optimal at 0.005″; as is the squeeze or pressure between the <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the substrate. Blanket-to-steel presses are considered one-color presses. In order to print the reverse side, the web is turned over between printing units by means of turning bars.

Blanket-to-blanket presses are considered a perfecting press because they print {{on both sides of the}} sheet at the same time. Since the blanket-to-blanket press has two <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinders</b> per colour, making it possible to print on both sides of a sheet, there is no impression <b>cylinder.</b> The opposite <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinders</b> act as an impression cylinder to each other when print production occurs. This method is most utilized on offset presses designed for envelope printing. There are also two plate cylinders per colour on the press; ...|$|R
50|$|The Printing Unit {{consists}} {{of many different}} systems. The dampening system is used to apply dampening solution to the plates with water rollers. The inking system uses rollers to deliver ink {{to the plate and}} <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinders</b> to be transferred to the substrate. The plate cylinder is where the plates containing all of the imaging are mounted. Finally the <b>blanket</b> and impression <b>cylinders</b> are used to transfer the image to the substrate running through the press.|$|R
50|$|Sheet-fed presses offer several advantages. Because {{individual}} {{sheets are}} fed through, {{a large number}} of sheet sizes and format sizes can be run through the same press. In addition, waste sheets can be used for make-ready (which is the testing process to ensure a quality print run). This allows for lower cost preparation so that good paper is not wasted while setting up the press, for plates and inks. Waste sheets do bring some disadvantages as often there are dust and offset powder particles that transfer on to the <b>blankets</b> and plate <b>cylinders,</b> creating imperfections on the printed sheet. This method produces the highest quality images.|$|R

Synchronization {{torsion bar}} {{is a key}} part in {{independent}} and dependent impression mechanism which ensures synchronization motion {{at both ends of}} <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Due to frequent action of the mechanism in high-speed printing, synchronization torsion bar would cause huge impact torque so as to affect parallel shifting of <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinder</b> and uniformity of printing impression. Based on structure features and force of synchronization torsion bar, finite element model of synchronization torsion bar was established by adopting structural mechanics and finite element method, then static stiffness of synchronization torsion bar was solved by adopting principle of minimum potential energy. The result of computation shows that the maximum torsion deformation of torsion bar in X direction happens at the left connection point. Because the deformation is very small, the bar can meet the requirements that <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinder...</b>|$|E

In {{the contact}} area of offset, a {{relative}} slide occurs between {{the surface of}} plate cylinder and <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which changes the print image and influences the printing quality. The relative slide in the cylinders ’ rolling process is investigated, and the determination rule of cylinders’ geometric parameters of offset press is proposed. The {{results show that the}} relative slide is minimization under the condition that the compression of elastic cylinder radius is 0. 2 times bigger than that of rigid cylinder radius, and the deformation of print image and dot gain both are minimization. The results provide theoretical direction for accurate determination of cylinder radius of offset press...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Brushes-type blanket washer’s {{function}} is rubbing a high speed spinning brush roller against blanket roller, {{so as to}} clean the paper-lints and ink which adhere {{to the surface of}} <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinder.</b> It is very important to do a research into the dynamic structural analysis of the washer which determines the stability of this equipment. With the gyroscopic effect dynamic analysis of brush blanket, we get the relation curve between central offset of the washer and the load of permanent joint. The result show that a minute alteration of the central offset causes effect change of the load. This result provides a theoretical basis to control the effect change and then improve the stability and decrease the cost...|$|E
40|$|According {{to lots of}} books, the {{pressure}} in offset printing affects the optical density {{and the quality of}} printouts. One of the quality parameters is a tone value increase. An advantage of our research method is obtaining printing effects for different pressures on one printout, thus meaning for identical printing conditions. We obtained the same printing conditions through using different amounts of underlay sheets fixed to the <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinder,</b> under a blanket. The pressure was increased from optimal settings - in accordance with the machine manufacturer’s recommendation. The test printouts were printed using Adast Dominant 515, on a coated and an uncoated paper. The optical density value was measured on the tone value scale from 10 % to 100 % stepping regularly by 10 %. For this scale the tone value increase was computed. The research shows that for both types of paper the optical density and the tone value increase changes not very much above the optimal pressure recommended by the machine manufacturer. A difference in the optical density and in the tone value increase is bigger for coated paper than for uncoated paper. Changes in these two parameters are negligible in places where used form 0 to 4 underlay sheets and are quite significant in the place where 5 underlay sheets were...|$|E
