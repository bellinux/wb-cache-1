The heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around day 21 or 22. The heart begins to develop near {{the head of the}} embryo in the cardiogenic area. Following cell signalling, two strands or cords begin to form in the cardiogenic [...] region As these form, a lumen develops within them, at which point, they are referred to as endocardial tubes.

The two tubes migrate together and fuse to form a single primitive heart tube, the tubular heart which quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these are the truncus <b>arteriosus,</b> <b>bulbus</b> cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and contractions propel the blood from tail to head, or from the sinus venosus to the truncus arteriosus. The truncus arteriosus will divide to form the aorta and pulmonary artery; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venous will develop into the posterior part of the right atrium, the sinoatrial node and the coronary sinus.|$|R

Between the atrium and ventricle is an ostial valve called the atrio-ventricular valve, and between the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> and ventricle is an ostial valve called the bulbo-ventricular valve.

50|$|The circulatory {{systems of}} all {{vertebrates}} are closed, {{just as in}} humans. Still, the systems of fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds show various stages {{of the evolution of}} the circulatory system. In fish, the system has only one circuit, with the blood being pumped through the capillaries of the gills and on to the capillaries of the body tissues. This is known as single cycle circulation. The heart of fish is therefore only a single pump (consisting of two chambers). Fish have a closed-loop circulatory system. The heart pumps the blood in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit.

Their hearts are exceptionally large, with ventricle masses and cardiac output roughly four to five times larger than those of other active fishes.

50|$|The {{life history}} of hydrozoans {{typically}} has a larval, polyp stage and a bell-shaped medusa stage. In Hydrichthys, the polyp has no tentacles but develops a root-like stolon which it thrusts {{through the skin}} of its host, usually a fish, to suck the blood and body fluids. During the medusa stage, Hydrichthys lives independently in the ocean. In one species, Hydrichthys sarcotretis, parasitism is taken a stage further when the hydrozoan attaches itself to the copepod Cardiodectes medusaeus. This is itself an ectoparasite of lanternfish in the family Myctophidae. The copepod attaches itself to the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> of the fish. Such a parasitic chain is known as hyperparasitism. The actions of the copepod castrate its fish host. Both male and female fish do not reproduce and seem to grow faster when attacked by the copepod {{and it seems to}} have a negligible energy demand from them. The hydrozoan parasite castrates the copepod, a process called hypercastration.|$|E
50|$|Major {{arteries and}} veins run {{longitudinally}} {{to and from}} the red swimming muscles, which are found close to the spinal column, just underneath the skin. Small arteries branch off and penetrate the red muscle, delivering oxygenated blood, whereas veins take deoxygenated blood back to the heart. The red muscles also have a high myoglobin content and capillary density, where many of the capillaries branch off. This helps increase surface area and red-cell residence time. The veins and arteries are organized in a way that allows countercurrent heat exchange. They are juxtaposed and branched extensively to form rete mirabile. This arrangement allows the heat produced by the red muscles to be retained within them, as it can be transferred from the venous blood to the ingoing arterial blood.Tunas have the highest arterial blood pressure among all fishes, due to a high resistance of blood flow in the gills. They also have a high heart rate, cardiac output, and ventilation rate. To achieve high cardiac outputs, tunas increase their heart rate exclusively (other teleosts may increase their stroke volume as well). High cardiac outputs in southern bluefin tuna are necessary to achieve their maximum metabolic rates. The <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> can take up an entire stroke volume, maintaining a smooth blood flow over the gills through diastole. This might, in turn, increase the rate of gas exchange. Their heart rate is also affected by temperature; at normal temperatures can it reach up to 200 beats/min.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{generally}} {{assumed that the}} outflow tract of the chondrichthyan heart consists of the conus arteriosus, characterized by cardiac muscle in its walls. However, classical observations, neglected for many years, indicated that the distal component of the cardiac outflow tract of several elasmobranch species was composed of tissue resembling that of the ventral aorta. The present study was outlined {{to test the hypothesis}} that this intrapericardial, non-myocardial component might be homologous to the actinopterygian <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus.</b> The material consisted of Atlantic catshark adults and embryos, which were examined by means of histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques for light and fluorescence microscopy. In this species, the distal component of the outflow tract differs histomorphologically from both the ventral aorta and the conus arteriosus; it is devoid of myocardium, is covered by epicardium and is crossed by the coronary arterial trunks. In the embryonic hearts examined, this distal component showed positive reactivity for 4, 5 -diaminofluorescein 2 -diacetate (DAF- 2 DA), a fluorescent nitric oxide indicator. These findings, together with other observations in holocephals and several elasmobranch species, confirm that chondrichthyans possess a <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> interposed between the conus arteriosus and the ventral aorta. Therefore, the primitive heart of gnathostomates consists of five intrapericardial components, sinus venosus, atrium, ventricle, conus arteriosus and <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus,</b> indicating that the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> can no longer be regarded as an actinopterygian apomorphy.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that the outflow tract of the elasmobranch heart, namely the cardiac portion {{intercalated}} between the ventricle and the ventral aorta, does not consist of a single component, the conus arteriosus, as has classically been assumed, but two, the myocardial conus arteriosus and the non-myocardial <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus.</b> From the evolutionary perspective, knowledge of the anatomy of the cardiac outflow tract of the holocephali is important, as they are the sister group of elasmobranchs. Our aim is to describe the cardiac outflow tract of four holocephalan species, two of them, Chimaera monstrosa and Hydrolagus affinis of the family Chimaeridae, and the other two, Harriotta raleighana and Rhinochimaera atlantica, of the family Rhinochimaeridae. The cardiac outflow tract of the four species consisted of a myocardial conus arteriosus, furnished with valves, and a <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> devoid of cardiac muscle. Both the bulbus and conus are tubular in shape. The length of the bulbus relative to the total length of the outflow tract is somewhat smaller in the rhinochimaerids (15 %- 19 %) than in the chimaerids (19 %- 23 %). The bulbus is covered by epicardium and is crossed by the main coronary artery trunks. Histologically, the bulbus is mainly composed of elastin and collagen, and, to a lesser extent, by smooth muscle. This suggests that in holocephalans, the bulbus actively helps to protect the gill vasculature from exposure to high-pressure pulses of blood. Our results prove that the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> is common to chondrichthyans. In addition, they support the hypothesis that the cardiac outflow tract consisted of a conus arteriosus and a <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> {{from the beginning of the}} jawed vertebrate radiation, contributing to our understanding of the morphological changes that have occurred at the arterial pole of the heart in both actinopterygians and sarcopterygians.

The morphology and morphogenesis of the cardiac outflow tract is a major topic in the study of the vertebrate circulatory system, especially regarding the pathologies affecting this region in humans. Recent studies have demonstrated that, in fish, the cardiac outflow tract consists of a myocardial conus arteriosus and a nonmyocardial <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus.</b> Moreover, the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> of fish has been considered homologous to the intrapericardial base of the aortic and pulmonary trunks of birds and mammals. Under this perspective, we have conducted a study on the outflow tract of Xenopus laevis, using histological, immunohistochemical and 3 D reconstruction techniques. It has been assumed that the outflow tract of Xenopus, which is intercalated between the ventricle and the great arterial trunks, is of myocardial nature. At its luminal side, it contains two sets of valves between which the so-called spiral valve lies. Our results demonstrate that, together with a proximal myocardial segment, a distal, nonmyocardial, intrapericardial segment is also present in amphibians. We propose that this distal segment, from which the pulmocutaneous and systemic arteries arise, is homologous to the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> of fish. Therefore, the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> is an evolutionarily conserved structure, which has become the aortic and pulmonary roots of birds and mammals. Our findings contribute to strengthening Xenopus as a good model to better understand the outflow tract morphology and evolution, and as an emerging model for studying human congenital heart diseases.

40|$|In chondrichthyans and actinopterygians, the {{outflow tract}} of the heart, namely, the cardiac portion {{intercalated}} between the ventricle and the ventral aorta, {{consists of two}} anatomical components: conus arteriosus and <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus.</b> In chondrichthyans and extant representatives of phylogenetically ancient actinopterygian groups, the conus and bulbus are well-developed in size, whereas in most teleosts, the bulbus is markedly larger than the conus. Current knowledge about the cardiac outflow tract of the polypteriformes is scarce and highly contradictory, a fact that contrasts with their crucial phylogenetic position at {{the source of the}} actinopterygian lineage. In fact, it remains uncertain whether they have a bulbus at the arterial pole of the heart. The present study aimed to elucidate the anatomical arrangement of the cardiac outflow tract of the bichir in an attempt to improve our understanding of the evolution of the vertebrate heart. We examined the hearts from 12 bichirs using histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques. Our findings showed that the outflow tract of the bichir consists of two components, namely, a long conus arteriosus, largely composed of myocardial tissue and furnished with a variable number of valves at its luminal side, and a very short, elastin rich <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus,</b> devoid of myocardium. The bulbus has an arterial-like histological composition.

40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown that the cardiac outflow tract of sharks and chimaeras does not consist of a single {{myocardial}} component, the conus arteriosus, as classically accepted, but two, namely, the myocardial conus arteriosus and the non-myocardial <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus.</b> However, the anatomical composition of the outflow tract of the batoid hearts remains unknown. The present study was designed to fill this gap. The material examined consisted of hearts of two species of rays, namely, the Mediterranean starry ray (Raja asterias) and sandy ray (Leucoraja circularis). They were studied using scanning electron microscopy, and histochemical and inmunohistochemical techniques. In both species, the outflow tract consists of two components, proximal and distal with regard to the ventricle. The proximal component is the conus arteriosus; it is characterized by the presence of compact myocardium in its wall and several transverse rows of pocket-shaped valves at its luminal side. Each valve consists of a leaflet and its supporting sinus. Histologically, the leaflet has two fibrosas, inner and outer, and a middle coat, the spongiosa. The distal component lacks myocardium. Its wall consists of smooth muscle cells, elastic fibers and collagen. Thus, it shows an arterial-like structure. However, it differs from the aorta because it is covered by the epicardium and crossed by coronary arteries. These findings indicate that the distal component is morphologically equivalent to the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> of sharks and chimaeras. In contrast to foregoing descriptions, the valves of the first transverse row are distally anchored to the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> and not to the ventral aorta.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{presence}} of the conus arteriosus {{in the heart of the}} adult gilthead seabream, Sparus auratus (Perciformes, Teleostei). The junctional region between the single ventricle and the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> has been studied by conventional light microscopy, and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, fluorescent phalloidin and antibodies against the muscle myosin heavy chains, laminin and collagen type IV have been used. The conus arteriosus is a distinct muscular segment interposed between the ventricle and the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus.</b> It is clearly different from the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> due to its myocardial nature. It can also be distinguished from the ventricular myocardium because: (1) it has a conus shape; (2) it is formed by compact, well-vascularized myocardium; (3) it is surrounded on its inner and outer faces by fibrous layers rich in collagen and elastin; (4) it constitutes the anatomical support of the so-termed conus valves; (5) it shows intense staining for laminin and type-IV collagen; and (6) the myocardial cells located close to the inner fibrous layer are helicoidally arranged. By contrast, the ventricular myocardium is highly trabecular, lacks a compacta, shows no vessels, and presents barely detectable amounts of laminin and collagen type IV. The presence of a distinct conus arteriosus in the heart of an evolutionary advanced teleost species indicates that the conus is not a vestigial segment from the evolutionary or embryological points of view. The characteristic spatial arrangement of the conus myocytes strongly suggests that the conus is implicated in the mechanical performance of the conus valves...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt is {{a widely}} held belief that the {{arterial}} pole of the zebrafish heart is unusual among models of comparative cardiogenesis. This is based, in part, on the report that the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> undergoes a striated-to-smooth muscle phenotypic transition during development. An implication {{of this is that}} the zebrafish, a model almost ubiquitously accepted in other fields of comparative biology, may be poorly suited to the study of conotruncal abnormalities in human disease. However, while the use of atrioventricular-specific molecular markers has allowed extensive characterization of the development of the atrium and ventricle, the lack of any bulbus-specific markers has meant that this region of the zebrafish heart is poorly characterized and quite possibly misunderstood. We have discovered that the fluorescent nitric oxide indicator 4, 5 -diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF- 2 DA) specifically labels the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> throughout development from approximately 48 h post-fertilization. Therefore, using DAF- 2 DA and an immunohistochemical approach, we attempted to further characterize the development of the bulbus.

40|$|The {{organization}} of {{structure and function}} of cardiac chambers in vertebrates is defined by chamber-specific distinct gene expression. This peculiarity and uniqueness of the genetic signatures demonstrates functional resolution attributed to the different chambers of the heart. Altered expression of the cardiac chamber genes can lead to individual chamber related dysfunctions and disease patho-physiologies. Information on transcriptional repertoire of cardiac compartments {{is important to understand}} the spectrum of chamber specific anomalies. We have carried out a genome wide transcriptome profiling study of the three cardiac chambers in the zebrafish heart using RNA sequencing. We have captured the gene expression patterns of 13, 396 protein coding genes in the three cardiac chambers-atrium, ventricle and <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus.</b> Of these, 7, 260 known protein coding genes are highly expressed (≥ 10 FPKM) in the zebrafish heart. Thus, this study represents nearly an all-inclusive information on the zebrafish cardiac transcriptome. In this study, a total of 96 differentially expressed genes across the three cardiac chambers in zebrafish were identified. The atrium, ventricle and <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> displayed 20, 32 and 44 uniquely expressing genes respectively. We validated the expression of predicted chamber-restricted genes using independent semi-quantitative and qualitative experimental techniques. In addition, we identified 23 putative novel protein coding genes that are specifically restricted to the ventricle and not in the atrium or <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus.</b> In our knowledge, these 23 novel genes have either not been investigated in detail or are sparsely studied. The transcriptome identified in this study includes 68 differentially expressing zebrafish cardiac chamber genes that have a human ortholog. We also carried out spatiotemporal gene expression profiling of the 96 differentially expressed genes throughout the three cardiac chambers in 11 developmental stages and 6 tissue types of zebrafish. We hypothesize that clustering the differentially expressed genes with both known and unknown functions will deliver detailed insights on fundamental gene networks that are important for the development and specification of the cardiac chambers. It is also postulated that this transcriptome atlas will help utilize zebrafish in a better way as a model for studying cardiac development and to explore functional role of gene networks in cardiac disease pathogenesis...|$|E

40|$|The teleost <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> {{is located}} within the pericardial cavity and lies rostral to the ventricle. Typically, it is swollen proximally, {{tapering}} distally into the ventral aorta. Within these parameters, a large variety of shapes occur, but the functional significance of the different shapes is unknown (Santer, 1985). The internal morphology of the bulbus also shows {{a large amount of}} variance between species. The lumen can be smooth, ridged or trabeculated. The trabeculae can be ‘spongy ’ or separated into discrete longitudinal and radial elements. Exceptionally, in one species of deep-sea Macrouridae, the proximal portion of the lumen contains a cartilaginous inner tube separate from the outer, spongy trabeculae (Greer-Walker et al., 1985). Unlike the rest of the heart (sinus venosus, atrium and ventricle), the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> contains no cardiac muscle and is not actively contractile. Whether the bulbus is cardiac or arterial in nature is an open question (Benjamin et al., 1983). However, due to some obvious similarities, arterial nomenclature is used to describe the bulbar morphology. As in arteries, the bulbar wall is composed of three layers: an intima composed of a single layer of endothelial cells, a thick media primarily composed of elastin and smooth muscle, and a collagenous adventitia surrounded by an outer layer of mesothelial cells. The endothelial cells can be squamous, columnar or cuboidal (Leknes, 1981, 1985; Benjamin et al., 1983, 1984) and often contain membrane-bound bodies that stain strongly with periodic acid-Shiff’s, indicating the presence of carbohydrates (Benjamin et al., 1983; Leknes, 1981). There is microscopic evidence for the discharge of membrane-bound vesicles into the lumen (Benjamin et al., 1983); however, their contents are unknown. Except for the layer of mesothelial cells, the adventitia is almost entirely collagen (Benjamin et al., 1983; Bushnell et al., 1992) and is thought to limit bulbar strain (Priede, 1976; Raso, 1993; Icardo et al., 1999 a,b). The media forms 90 – 95 % of the bulbus and is composed of smooth muscle sparsely distributed within an elasti...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} {{zebrafish}} and 3, 3 #, 4, 4 #, 5 -pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) {{to investigate the}} developmental toxicity of polychlori-nated biphenyls (PCBs) that exert their effects through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). We found that cardiac and neural crest (NC) –derived jaw and branchial cartilages are specifically targeted early in development. The suite of malformations, which ultimately leads to circulatory failure, includes a severely dysmorphic heart with a reduced <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> and abnormal atrioventricular and outflow valve formation. Early NC migration and patterning of the jaw and branchial cartilages was normal. However, the jaw and branchial cartilages failed to grow to normal size. In the heart, the ventricular myocardium showed a reduction in cell number and size. The heart and jaw/branchial phenotype could be rescued by pifithrin-a, a blocker of p 53. However, the function of pifithrin-a in this model may act as a competitiv...|$|E
40|$|Aporocotyle mariachristinae n. sp. and A. ymakara Villalba & Fernández, 1986 were {{collected}} from the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> and ventral aorta of pink cusk-eels, Genypterus blacodes (Forster, 1801) from Patagonia, Argentina. A. mariachristinae n. sp. can be distinguished from all the species of Aporocotyle by the asymmetrical extension of posterior caeca (right posterior caecum longer, terminating at the area between mid-level of ovary and posterior body end; left posterior caecum shorter, terminating at the area between mid-level of cirrus sac and posterior to reproductive organs), the distribution of spines along the ventro-lateral body margins {{and the number of}} testes. The new species clearly differs from A. ymakara, from the same host species, in the esophagus / body length ratio, the absence of distal loops at caeca, the anterior caeca / posterior caeca length ratio, and the number of testes. Additionally, in A. ymakara the left posterior caecum may be longe...|$|E
40|$|Myxobolus dogieli Bykhovskaya-Pavlovskaya & Bykhovski, 1940 is {{regarded}} as a site specific myxosporean, infecting the heart of cyprinid fish. During a survey of the myxosporean fauna of Lake Balaton fish, heart myxobolosis was found in the common bream, Abramis brama, with heavy infection of the ventricle and the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> in some infected bream. Developing and mature plasmodia were mostly in the connective tissue of the subepicardium and subendocardium. Plasmodia developing in the subendocardium protruded into the lumen of the heart, while plasmodia developing in the subepicardium protruded over the epicardium forming large sausage-like outgrowths. Plasmodia with mature spores were found in the summer. The shape and size of the spores corresponded to those of the original description. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 18 S rDNA sequence of M. dogieli showed that this species fit well in the genus Myxobolus. As no molecular data are available on spores from the type host, common carp, the species studied by us is temporarily designated as Myxobolus s. l. dogieli...|$|E
40|$|International audienceElucidating cardiac {{evolution}} has been frustrated {{by lack of}} fossils. One celebrated enigma in cardiac evolution involves {{the transition from a}} cardiac outflow tract dominated by a multi-valved conus arteriosus in basal actinopterygians, to an outflow tract commanded by the non valved, elastic, <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> in higher actinopterygians. We demonstrate that cardiac preservation is possible in the extinct fish Rhacolepis buccalis from the Brazilian Cretaceous. Using X-ray synchrotron microtomography, we show that Rhacolepis fossils display hearts with a conus arteriosus containing at least five valve rows. This represents a transitional morphology between the primitive, multivalvar, conal condition and the derived, monovalvar, bulbar state of the outflow tract in modern actinopterygians. Our data rescue a long-lost cardiac phenotype (119 - 113 Ma) and suggest that outflow tract simplification in actinopterygians is compatible with a gradual, rather than a drastic saltation event. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of studying cardiac evolution in fossil...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the pathological changes of heart and bulbus artrius of rainbow trout breeders in several group of ages and density. The aim of study was to consider {{the process and the}} intensity of the heart and <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> damages in accordance to gender, age and stocking density of trout in three fish culture center (Zarghezel, Niyak in Haraz Region,Mazandaran and Espiran in Tabriz city environs). In field research, the all records the feed and feeding type, rate of mortality, stocking density of spawners and per spawners fishes, water chemical and physical specification was screened. Stocking density was considered as the most important stressor. 10 fish specimens from 7 weight groups (less than 90 g, 90 to 300 g, 300 to 500 g, 500 to 1000 g, 1 to 3 kg, 3 to 5 kg, over 5 kg), totally 210 specimens were sampled and heart and <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> were taken. Samples were fixed in 10 % formalin and transferred to pathology laboratory of veterinary faculty of Tabriz Azad University. Histopathological slides and H&E staining were prepared from these samples. In total, 47 male and 73 female samples showed cardiovascular injury (29 cases in extensive system, 41 cases in semi intensive system, 50 cases in intensive system). The most important was damages, edema and hyperemia in spongy layer of atrium and ventricle muscles, but degeneration the muscle fibers, moderate edema, minor vascular damage. Hemorrhage as the effect of severs vascular damage, thrombus, sever inflammation, sever degeneration in muscle fiber, necrosis and fibrose were further pathological changed. The results of this study showed that the severity of damage increased by increasing the age (weight) of fishes. This situation was seen in all three culturing system (extensive system, semi intensive system, recirculation system). Histopathological changes is obviously seen in samples over 500 g, therefore the damages were found to be important (P< 0. 05). Pathological effects and its severity in recirculation system was significantly high (P< 0. 05). Comparison with two other culturing system, histopathological changed in heart and bulbus arterius between male and female was significantly different...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of melanin-containing {{cells in the}} heart has been documented in tetrapods, but not in fish. It has been even suggested that dark pigmented cells are exclusively associated with hearts having two atria and two ventricles. The aim here is to report the occurrence of pigment cells {{in the heart of}} the bichir, an extant representative of the polypteriformes, an ancient ray-finned fish lineage that split from the stem of the actinopterygians soon after their divergence from the sarcopterygians. The bichir heart is composed of sinus venosus, atrium, ventricle, conus arteriosus and <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> arranged sequentially within the pericardial cavity. Dendritic-shaped cells containing melanosomes were found in the five cardiac components of the 12 bichirs included in this study. Numerous melanophores were distributed regularly over the surface of all segments having myocardium in their walls, thus resulting in a marked pigmentation of the whole heart. The <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus,</b> which in the bichir is reduced in size, showed an even more intense pigmentation. In all instances, the melanophores were localized in the subepicardial space. Pigment cells also occurred in the pericardium and ventral aorta. The functional role of melanocytes in the tetrapod heart remains obscure. Antiinflamatory activity, cytoprotection and effects on the viscoelastic properties of the cardiac tissue have been adduced as possible actions of such cells. The role of pigment cells in the bichir heart constitutes a new open question. Interestingly, however, the only cells that have been shown to form melanin-containing cells in the heart derive from the neural crest. If the melanophores of the bichir heart are indeed of neural crest origin, it would suggest a much more extensive contribution and persistence of elements from the neural crest in the primitive heart of jawed vertebrates as assumed so far in most papers devoted to vertebrate heart embryology.

40|$|For {{several species}} of fish myxosporeans known at present, the {{musculature}} has been designated as the location of intrapiscine development. In {{the majority of these}} cases, plas- modia and spores are actually found in the muscle cells, but there are also myxosporeans that select intermuscular connective tissue, fish bones, nerves and capillaries of the musculature as their site of development. During the plasmodial development of Myxobolus, Henneguya and Thelohanellus species in fish inhabiting Hungarian freshwaters, 3 main locations of development inside the muscles were identified. Pseudodispar-type plasmodia, such as M. cyprini, M. musculi and M. pseudodispar, form plasmodia intracellularly in the muscle cells, while the plasmodia of M. pfeifferi, M. sandrae and T. hovorkai develop in the intermuscular connective tissue. A similar development in the connective tissue of the ventricle and the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> was observed for M. dogieli, a heart parasite found in some cyprinid fishes. The third type of development is repre- sented by M. tauricus, which prefers the collagenous elements of the fin rays, but its plasmodia are commonly found in the muscle attached to the fish bones...|$|E
40|$|In the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> of {{goldfish}} Carassius auratus a subendothelial "reticular space" {{was comprised}} of reticular-like cells, neutrophils, medium-sized granular leucocytes, phagocytes, endothelial cells and reticulo-endothelial cells; herein, rodlet cells (RCs) accumulated and probably matured. Four classes of RCs were identified: (1) Those occurring in the "reticular space" and contacting reticular-like cells; (2) those present in the "reticular space" contacting reticular-like and endothelial cells; here the RCs were discharging; (3) those occurring in the bulbar lumen anchored to lining endothelial cells or other RCs; (4) those free in the bulbar lumen. There {{was no significant difference}} in the number of RCs among control and saline- and dexamethasone-treated fish, but significant differences were found in RCs’ class partition and in their discharge modality. In dexamethasone-treated goldfish class (3) RCs were almost absent (2 % v. 10 % of the other experimental groups), moreover 35 % of the RCs developed a “bleb” discharge modality rather than the most typical “koronenartigen konfiguration” which developed in the vast majority (90 %) of the other experimental groups...|$|E
40|$|Photocrosslinked hydrogels {{reinforced}} by microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) were prepared from a methacrylate-functionalized fish elastin polypeptide and MFC dispersed in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). First, a water-soluble elastin peptide with a molecular weight of ca. 500 g/mol from the fish <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> was polymerized by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), a condensation reagent, and then modified with 2 -isocyanatoethyl methacrylate (MOI) {{to yield a}} photocrosslinkable fish elastin polypeptide. The product was dissolved in DMSO and irradiated with UV light {{in the presence of}} a radical photoinitiator. We obtained hydrogels successfully by substitution of DMSO with water. The composite gel with MFC was prepared by UV irradiation of the photocrosslinkable elastin polypeptide mixed with dispersed MFC in DMSO, followed by substitution of DMSO with water. The tensile test of the composite gels revealed that the addition of MFC improved the tensile properties, and the shape of the stress–strain curve of the composite gel became more similar to the typical shape of an elastic material with an increase of MFC content. The rheology measurement showed that the elastic modulus of the composite gel increased with an increase of MFC content. The cell proliferation test on the composite gel showed no toxicity...|$|E
40|$|The phylum Myxozoa Grassé, 1970, {{consists}} of a heterogenous group of around 50 genera that are worldwide disseminated {{in a wide variety}} of aquatic media. In the present study, 43 specimens of Pimelodus ornatus were collected from an adjacent area to the Cachoeira do Arari municipality on Marajó Island, in the Brazilian state of Pará, in 2013. Macroscopic analysis showed the presence of whitened plasmodia located in the cardiac muscle and also in the region between the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> and atrium cordis. Microscopic analysis on the parasitized tissues revealed spores that were typically piriform, with the anterior portion slightly narrower than the posterior end. The spore valves were symmetrical. The present species is placed in the genus Myxobolus Butschli, 1882, because of the presence of a pair of equal polar capsules in each spore. The prevalence of parasitism observed was 13. 9 % (6 / 43). This research note reports the first occurrence of Myxobolus as a parasite of the heart in the teleostean fish P. ornatus in the Amazon region and confirms the occurrence of secondary myocarditis in this fish, caused by parasitism by Myxobolus sp. The rarity of this parasitic species of Myxobolus at this tissue site, associated with other spore morphology characteristics in the fish, suggests that it is an undescribed species...|$|E
40|$|The {{findings}} of Hall and Waidman (1) that sodium caprylate, when adminis-tered intravenously to cats, produces an electrocardiographic picture {{similar to that}} produced by toxic doses of digitalis prompted a series of experiments to investigate the possibility that sodium caprylate might have a digitalis-like action on the contraction of the heart. This report is on {{a study of the}} effect of sodium caprylate on the cardiac output of isolated frog hearts. METHODS. A glass cannula 6. 5 cm. long with a U-shaped curve on its free end was in-serted through the left aortic arch into the <b>bulbus</b> <b>arteriosus,</b> and a glass cannula connected by rubber tubing to a 2 ml. reservoir was tied into the inferior vena cava. All other vessels were ligated, the heart was removed from the frog and supported by clamps attached to the cannulae. The height of the reservoir was adjusted so that its top was 4. 5 cm. above the heart. It was kept filled to overflowing from a large reservoir so that the venous pressure was always 4. 5 cm. of water. The heart rate was counted for 30 seconds at regular intervals and the output simultaneously collected from the curved aortic cannula. Stroke volumes were calculated.
