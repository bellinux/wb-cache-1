40|$|A Final ReportThe pellets {{produced}} by Minnesota taconite companies generally contain between 4. 0 and 7. 0 percent silica. These silica levels were established initially by the concentratability of the ore, that is, its response to closed circuit ball mill grinding and magnetic concentration. Those operations that had taconite {{that was easy}} to concentrate generally produced lower silica pellets. As processing technology improved and it became possible to achieve lower silica levels constraints imposed by the <b>blast-furnace</b> <b>operation</b> became limiting. These constraints related primarily to sulphur and alkali levels in the furnace which control both the volume and chemistry of the furnace slag. Because the trend in blast-furnace practice has been to move toward lower slag volumes, pellets with lower silica levels have become more desirable. Recent extensive installation of external hot metal desulphurization facilities at many steel works allows even lower slag volumes. The basic driving force to go to lower slag volumes is the cost and availability of high quality metallurgical grade coke and related environmental problems. The recent move to produce fluxed pellets has made lower pellet silica levels more attractive because of the lower palletizing costs related to both the lower flux addition and higher production rates with a lower silica content. A common target silica level in fluxed pellets is now about 4. 0 percent. A 4. 0 percent silica pellet requires a concentrate containing between 3. 7 and 3. 9 percent silica depending upon bentonite addition levels. This lower silica level has been accomplished in some plants {{by the use of}} fine screens, while other plants require the use of silica flotation. The lower silica level has been accomplished at a relatively small incremental cost, generally less than $ 0. 50 per ton. With increasing pressure from the blast furnaces for lower-silica pellets to reduce coke consumption, concentrate silica levels on the order of 3. 0 percent may be common in the future. In addition to the need to produce a lower silica blast-furnace feed, there is a potential need to produce even lower silica concentrates, below 3. 0 percent, as feed stock for direct steelmaking. Worldwide the current research emphasis is on the development of a coal-based direct-steelmaking process to replace the conventional two step, blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace, process. Most of the current prototype direct steel making processes would benefit from a lower silica feed. These low silica levels will require increasingly complex and expensive secondary treatment of normal magnetic concentrates which exceed the capability of current taconite processing flowsheets. The purpose of this test program is to establish the lower silica limits that can be achieved by current technology for various Minnesota taconites and gain a preliminary indication of the cost. Because the magnetite concentrates {{produced by}} different taconite plants range significantly in terms of their size-silica relationships the program included three different concentrate sources for evaluation. Major differences will exist between concentrates produced in a fully autogenous grinding system and those produced in a conventional rod mill-ball mill circuit in which the ball mills are closed with hydrocyclones and/or a combination of hydrocyclones and fine screens. There are also differences {{in the nature of the}} siliceous gangue minerals in the various operations. The concentrates from the western Mesabi range contain quartz and low- grade metamorphic iron silicates such as minnesotaite, stilpnomelane, and talc and iron carbonates. The concentrates from the east Mesabi metamorphosed iron formation contain high grade metamorphic iron silicates such as cummingtonite, grunerite, and fayalite as well as quartz. The type of gangue mineral greatly affects the ability to upgrade the concentrates by silica flotation. The purpose of this test program is to determine the lowest silica content that it is technically possible to produce from three different concentrate sources representing the east Mesabi metamorphosed iron formation (Erie), the unmetamorphosed central range produced in a rod mill and ball mill circuit (Minntac), and the unmetamorphosed western Mesabi produced in an autogenous milling circuit (Hibtac). Sufficient data were collected to allow preliminary cost estimates to be made at several silica levels. The cost estimates will be based on reagent consumption, regrind power and metal requirements, and iron recovery. This report contains all of the information obtained on the Erie samples. This includes the results of the initial characterization studies, basic bench scale beneficiation test results, pilot plant flotation data, and the results of the secondary and tertiary treatment of bulk flotation froth to improve overall iron recovery.

40|$|Two {{types of}} the systems {{providing}} groups of blast-furnaces with blast through one or two common manifolds were analyzed in the article. The first system consists of four turbo-superchargers, working in parallel for one common manifold and four blast furnaces supplied with blast from that manifold. A differential equation was found for such a system, describing pressure alterations inside the manifold, due to parameters of the blast consumed by the furnaces and due to the operation of turbo-superchargers working in parallel for that manifold. The second system of blast supply has {{the same number of}} turbo-superchargers and blast-furnaces, but has two common manifolds, connected by a pipeline. A mathematical description of this work as a system of two differential equations, describing the dependence of the blast pressure upon the parameters of turbo-superchargers and the mode of <b>blast-furnaces</b> <b>operation</b> was developed. The obtained differential equations are differential equations with random coefficients. Then it was shown that by replacing these random coefficients with their average values and analyzing the set systems operation mode afterwards {{it will be possible to}} evaluate the parameters of the turbo-superchargers, that will make it possible to provide the blast furnaces with blast with preset parameters. Detailed examples were given for each type {{of the systems}}, in which the required parameters of the turbo-superchargers were found. It was shown that the second type of blast supply was more preferable, although it requires increased parameters of turbo-supercharger...|$|R
