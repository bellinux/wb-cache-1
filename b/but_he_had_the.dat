5|$|But {{in early}} August, Holmes à Court {{contacted}} Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson only raised {{his bid to}} $47.5million, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> advantage {{of being able to}} close the deal faster, having completed due diligence of ATV Music prior to any formal agreement. He also agreed to visit Australia as a guest of Holmes à Court and appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Holmes à Court included some more assets and agreed to establish a scholarship in Jackson's name at a U.S. university. Branca closed the deal and purchased ATV Music on Jackson's behalf for $47.5million on August 10. 1985. In October 1985, Jackson fulfilled his contract provision to visit Perth, Western Australia and appear on the telethon, where he spoke briefly and met with two children.|$|E
5|$|Meade {{had his own}} detractors as well. Similar to the {{situation}} with Lee, Meade suffered partisan attacks about his performance at Gettysburg, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> misfortune of experiencing them in person. Supporters of his predecessor, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, lambasted Meade before the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, where Radical Republicans suspected that Meade was a Copperhead and {{tried in vain to}} relieve him from command. Daniel E. Sickles and Daniel Butterfield accused Meade of planning to retreat from Gettysburg during the battle. Most politicians, including Lincoln, criticized Meade for what they considered to be his half-hearted pursuit of Lee after the battle. A number of Meade's most competent subordinates—Winfield S. Hancock, John Gibbon, Gouverneur K. Warren, and Henry J. Hunt, all heroes of the battle—defended Meade in print, but Meade was embittered by the overall experience.|$|E

He governed Bithynia and succeeded Pertinax as the proconsul of Africa.|$|E
25|$|Knowing that Sicily's Norman {{aristocracy}} {{would not}} welcome a Hohenstaufen king, William made the aristocracy, {{and the important}} men of his court, promise to recognize Constance's succession if he died without direct heirs. Nevertheless, after his unexpected death in 1189 his cousin, (and Constance's nephew) Tancred, seized the throne. Tancred was illegitimate <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> support {{of most of the}} great men of the kingdom such as Vice-Chancellor Matthew of Ajello. On the other hand Archbishop Walter of the Mill, and most of the aristocracy, supported Constance. Eventually however, Matthew was able to induce Walter, along with other barons, to support Tancred.|$|E
25|$|Strickland {{returned}} to Yorkshire in 1542, {{and with the}} proceeds of his voyages bought estates at Wintringham and at Boynton, both in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He seems to have lived {{the remainder of his}} life at Place Newton, his house at Wintringham where he is buried, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> Norman manor house at Boynton rebuilt as Boynton Hall, and this became the seat of his descendants. The church at Boynton is liberally decorated with the family's turkey crest, most notably {{in the form of a}} probably-unique lectern (a 20th-century creation) carved in the form of a turkey rather than the conventional eagle, the bible supported by its outspread tail feathers.|$|E

25|$|In 1525 the Spanish crown {{appointed}} him {{governor of the}} autonomous territory of Pánuco on the Gulf Coast {{in what is now}} northeast Mexico, arriving to take up the appointment in May 1527. He traveled with Luís Ponce de Leon and arrived in Hispaniola in 1526, but here he fell sick and did not arrive in Mexico until May 1527, immediately assuming his post. Cortés had already extended his reach into Pánuco, so that Guzmán's appointment was a direct challenge. His appointment was opposed by the Pro-Cortés faction of the struggle for power in early colonial Mexico, who viewed him as an outsider with no military experience. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> support of the Council of Indies and the Spanish Crown who saw him as a counterbalance to the figure of Cortés whose aspirations to power worried the King of Spain. Guzmán's appointment gave heart to Spanish conquerors who had not received what they considered sufficient rewards from Cortés's distribution of encomiendas and to Spanish settlers who had not participated in the conquest but saw their paths to position and wealth blocked by the Cortés faction.|$|E

All the new fiction. What he didn't like was Bellow, Updike, Cheever, Salinger, Capote, and Mailer. He didn't know how to use them.|$|E
500|$|He {{left the}} factory, {{becoming}} a raznoschik, a peddler; his memoir hints at back-door assignations with [...] "servant girls and chambermaids"; {{by his own}} description, his life at this point was just a step from a life of crime.

Fishburne stated that he modeled his {{character}} after Ed Bradley, stating that [...] "my inspiration really is the late Ed Bradley, who was a CBS correspondent on 60 Minutes for many years ... legendary Ed Bradley... was a friend, a mentor, and {{a role model for}} me, particularly because he worked in journalism, and {{he was the kind of}} guy who walked with kings, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> common touch.

Running back Jim Brown surpassed Motley's rushing records in the early 1960s, but many of Motley's coaches and fellow players {{regarded}} Motley as the better player, {{in part because of}} his strength as a blocker. [...] "There is no comparison between Jim Brown and Marion Motley," [...] Graham said at a luncheon in Canton in 1964. [...] "Motley was the greatest all-around fullback." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with entertainment website Digital Spy Dennis discussed Paul's later relationships in depth. Paul's relationship with Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) was short lived, he mistreated her but ultimately in a twist for the character, he did the right thing. Dennis describes this as: [...] "The Lyn story was quite sincere, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> good sense {{on the day of}} the wedding to tell her that he was no good. So he obviously cared about Lyn, but then she came back and haunted him." [...] His relationship with Rebecca Napier (Jane Hall) at times can be fiery, of this Dennis said: [...] "I want to see Paul and Rebecca be like Angie and Dirty Den. I think Rebecca is capable of that. She plays a fiery character and is a very strong. Paul needs somebody who is absolutely there for him and adores him, but will take no shit from him and stand up and fight as hard as she does." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regardless of his {{ultimate}} religious beliefs, most scholars {{would accept the}} judgment of Brigham Madsen that Roberts possessed a [...] "deeply embedded integrity, and above all... fearless willingness to follow wherever his reason led him. He could be abrasive in his defense of stubbornly held beliefs, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> capacity to change his views when confronted with new and persuasive evidence." [...] To Leonard J. Arrington, Roberts was [...] "the intellectual leader of the Mormon people {{in the era of}} Mormonism's finest intellectual attainment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chong's jail time, {{the tactics}} {{utilized}} by the DEA agents during the investigation, and the investigation's focus on Tommy rather than Paris Chong (the company's CEO), raised concern among critics of selective prosecution. When {{asked why the}} government had focused on Tommy Chong instead of the company’s CEO, Paris, Buchanan responded that [...] "Tommy Chong was the more responsible corporate officer because he financed and marketed the product." [...] When questioned on the disparity between sentences/fines that the other 54 individuals received compared to Tommy Chong, Buchanan stated, [...] "He [...] wasn't the biggest supplier. He was a relatively new player, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> ability to market products like no other." ...|$|E

In the presidential election, Bhutto initially proposed Malik Qasim, who had been involved in the MRD, as the PPP's nominee, but the military refused to accept this. Bhutto relented and agreed that Khan could be nominated as the PPP's presidential candidate. Bhutto also wanted to replace Mahbub ul Haq as finance minister, but again the military opposed her. Compromising, she accepted al Huq's continued role as finance minister but appointed Wasim Jafri as her financial advisor.|$|E
