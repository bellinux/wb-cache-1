When the Korbinite's homeworld {{was destroyed by}} Surtur's Fire Demons, <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill was specially modified to oversee the Korbinite's survival on the Skuttlebutt with the race under cryogenic hibernation. When Surtur's Fire Demons attack the Skuttlebutt, <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill has the Skuttlebutt take refuge in an asteroid field. His presence was detected by Heimdall as Thor sets out to investigate. When Thor makes {{his way into the}} Skuttlebutt, he is ambushed by <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill (who mistakens Thor for a Fire Demon) and manages to pin him down. <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill successfully lifts Mjolnir and attacks Thor with it. <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill is then teleported to Asgard by Odin (who was trying to teleport Thor back) where <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill mistakens the Asgardians as Fire Demons and attacks Balder, Sif, and the Warriors Three before being subdued by Odin and finally realizes his error due to Odin's genuine concern and love for his son. Thor is teleported back to Asgard by Odin. When <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill reveals his people's plight and demands to wield Mjolnir to fight the Fire Demons, Sif offers to assist him in the battle and Thor offers Mjolnir. Odin denies the offer made by Thor and says he has an idea. After Thor convinces Eitri to help, <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill receives Stormbreaker (which was made from the remaining Uru following Surtur's raid) and uses it to help Thor and Sif fight the Fire Demons in order to keep them from harming the Korbinites. While Sif and the Skuttlebutt's defenses fight the Fire Demons, Thor and <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill fight Enchantress who has been converted into Surtur's mind-controlled pawn. After Thor and <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill defeat Enchantress which causes the Fire Demons to disappear, Surtur speaks through her telling Thor and <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill that Enchantress is now under his control. <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill then leaves with Skuttlebutt in order to find a safe place for the Korbinites to settle down and repopulate, but he promises to aid Thor in his battle with Surtur, the Fire Demon Lord of Muspelheim.|$|R

[...] An essential part of his work was devoted to the measurement of the electron-neutrino angular correlation in neutron decay, a difficult project that went on for years and was finally concluded when Paul was no longer at Seibersdorf.In Brookhaven, Paul attempted to find a possible parity admixture in an excited state of a radioactive hafnium isotope, which would manifest itself by a small circular polarization of the emitted gamma radiation. The result was negative: there was no circular polarization. While at Brookhaven, Paul also published a summarizing article on the shapes of beta spectra which he had already begun at Seibersdorf.In 1970, Paul received a call to the young University of Social Sciences, Economics and Business in Linz (from 1975: Johannes Kepler University of Linz) for the newly established chair of Experimental Physics. Paul had the chance to cooperate in the planning of his professorship even prior to beginning his office. Since no chair for experimental physics had existed before, everything had to be built up from scratch (teaching, laboratories, electronics, mechanical workshop).|$|E

The full lunar spectrum was generated using 90 lines and a continuum gamma ray background taken from Apollo 15 and 16 data. The Monte Carlo program uses the exact dimensions and composition of the Gamma <b>Ray</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> in order to most accurately predict spectral performance, assuming an operating temperature on orbit of - 30 degrees Celsius. The Gamma <b>Ray</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> will be launched aboard the Lunar Prospector spacecraft on October 24, 1997.
