One yearns for Welch's wonderful voice to be delivering lines of more import than the nonsense she's often delivering here." [...] In a mixed review, Slant Magazine's Matthew Cole wrote that [...] "he first four tracks of Ceremonials are essentially flawless", but felt that the album [...] "can't help but get weaker as it continues, a fact which owes less {{to the quality of}} the songwriting than to the album's length [...] and a far less dynamic second act." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent expressed, [...] "n cementing one style, some of the possibilities offered by Lungs have been choked off. The only time [...] and The Machine stray from the formula is the Krautrock-disco motorik of 'Spectrum'; elsewhere, declamatory piano chords and <b>burring</b> organ underpin the banked, soaring vocals that are her trademark". Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal argued, [...] "Instead of Lungs largely charming yet discombobulating diversity, Ceremonials suffers from a repetitiveness that's akin to looking at a skyline filled with 100-story behemoths lined-up one after the other, blocking out everything but their own size." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>BUR</b> 1 and <b>BUR</b> 2 were {{previously}} identified by a genetic selection for mutations that increase transcription from basal promoters in vivo. <b>BUR</b> 1 encoded a putative protein kinase with greatest similarity {{to members of}} the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family, although that similarity was not sufficient to classify it as a CDK. It was also not known whether <b>Bur</b> 1 activity was cyclin dependent and, if so, which cyclins stimulated <b>Bur</b> 1. The molecular cloning and characterization of <b>BUR</b> 2 presented here sheds light on these issues. Genetic analysis indicates that <b>BUR</b> 2 function is intimately related to that of <b>BUR</b> 1 : <b>bur</b> 1 and <b>bur</b> 2 mutations cause nearly identical spectra of mutant phenotypes, and overexpression of <b>BUR</b> 1 suppresses a <b>bur</b> 2 null allele. Biochemical analysis has provided a molecular basis for these genetic observations. We find that <b>BUR</b> 2 encodes a cyclin for the <b>Bur</b> 1 protein kinase, based on the following evidence. First, the <b>BUR</b> 2 amino acid sequence reveals similarity to the cyclins; second, <b>Bur</b> 1 and <b>Bur</b> 2 coimmunoprecipitate from crude extracts and interact in the two-hybrid system; and third, <b>BUR</b> 2 is required for <b>Bur</b> 1 kinase activity in vitro. Our combined genetic and biochemical results therefore indicate that <b>Bur</b> 1 and <b>Bur</b> 2 comprise a divergent CDK-cyclin complex that has an important functional role during transcription in vivo...|$|R
40|$|<b>BUR</b> 3 and <b>BUR</b> 6 were {{identified}} previously by selecting for mutations that increase transcription from an upstream activating sequence (UAS) -less promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The <b>bur</b> 3 - 1 and <b>bur</b> 6 - 1 mutations are recessive, increase transcription from a suc 2 delta uas allele, and cause other mutant phenotypes, suggesting that <b>Bur</b> 3 p and <b>Bur</b> 6 p function as general repressors of the basal transcriptional machinery. The molecular cloning and characterization of <b>BUR</b> 3 and <b>BUR</b> 6 are presented here. <b>BUR</b> 3 {{is identical to}} MOT 1, a previously characterized essential gene that encodes an ATP-dependent inhibitor of the TATA box-binding protein. Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that <b>BUR</b> 6 encodes a homolog of DRAP 1 (also called NC 2 alpha), a mammalian repressor of basal transcription. Strains that contain a <b>bur</b> 6 null allele are viable but grow extremely poorly, demonstrating that <b>BUR</b> 6 is critical for normal cell growth in yeast. The <b>Bur</b> 6 p histone fold domain is required for function; an extensive nonoverlapping set of deletion alleles throughout the histone fold domain impairs <b>BUR</b> 6 function in vivo, whereas mutations in the amino- and carboxy-terminal tails have no detectable effect. <b>BUR</b> 6 and <b>BUR</b> 3 /MOT 1 have different functions depending on promoter context: although the <b>bur</b> 3 - 1 and <b>bur</b> 6 - 1 mutations increase transcription from delta uas promoters, they result in reduced transcription from the wild-type GAL 1 and GAL 10 promoters. This transcriptional defect {{is due to the}} inability of the GAL 10 UAS to function in <b>bur</b> 6 - 1 strains. The similar phenotypes of <b>bur</b> 6 and <b>bur</b> 3 (mot 1) mutations suggest that <b>Bur</b> 6 p and Mot 1 p have related, but not identical, functions in modulating the activity of the general transcription machinery in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the comparative efficacy of Polymer <b>bur</b> (Smartprep) and Conventional <b>burs</b> (Carbide <b>bur</b> & Diamond Points) in selective Dentin caries removal. Materials and method: 15 freshly extracted carious human premolars and molars {{were selected for}} this study. These teeth were split {{in the center of}} carious lesion, in order to obtain two corresponding half. Thus 30 samples were prepared in this way. These were randomly divided in to 3 groups of 10 samples each. Group 1 : The carious portion of these samples was excavated with the help of polymer <b>bur</b> Smartprep (SS White). Group 3 : Prepared with Tungsten carbide round <b>bur</b> (No. 018). Group 3 : Prepared with the help of Diamond points (No. 018). The period of time involved in this process is measured. After excavation of all carious lesions, a longitudinal section from mid most part of lesion was obtain with the help of diamond disc at slow speed. After staining with caries detector dye “Seek”, the sections were subjected to histological evaluation under stereomicro-scope. The thickness of remaining caries is measured in more or less than 1 mm. Results: The difference in grading of remaining carious dentin between Polymer <b>bur</b> and Conventional <b>burs</b> were statistically non- significant, but Polymer <b>bur</b> taken more time in comparison to Conventional <b>burs.</b> Conclusion: Smartprep <b>bur</b> is more conservative in selectively dentin caries removal than Conventional <b>burs</b> but same time it is more time consuming than Conventional <b>burs...</b>|$|R

There were always miners about. They moved with their strange, distorted dignity, a certain beauty, and unnatural stillness in their bearing, a look of abstraction and half resignation in their pale, often gaunt faces.

It was as if all clear and simple enthusiasm had been suddenly knocked endways; as if a certain splendour of life that he had felt and seen of late had been dipped in cloud. Out there at the front, over here in hospital, life had been seeming so--as it were--heroic; and yet it held such mean and murky depths as well!

40|$|Arthropod growth {{requires}} molt-associated {{changes in}} softness and stiffness of the cuticle that protects from desiccation, infection and injury. Cuticle hardening in insects {{depends on the}} blood-borne hormone, bursicon (<b>Burs),</b> although {{it has never been}} determined in hemolymph. Whilst also having <b>Burs,</b> decapod crustaceans reiterate molting many more times during their longer life span and are encased in a calcified exoskeleton, which after molting undergoes similar initial cuticle hardening processes as in insects. We investigated the role of homologous crustacean <b>Burs</b> in cuticular changes and growth in the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. We found dramatic increases in size and number of <b>Burs</b> cells during development in paired thoracic ganglion complex (TGC) neurons with pericardial organs (POs) as neurohemal release sites. A skewed expression of <b>Burs</b> b/Burs a mRNA in TGC corresponds to protein contents of identified <b>Burs</b> b homodimer and <b>Burs</b> heterodimer in POs. In hemolymph, <b>Burs</b> is consistently present at, 21 pM throughout the molt cycle, showing a peak of, 89 pM at ecdysis.

60|$|The {{footpaths}} and causeway {{were black}} with throngs of the townsfolk, men, women, and children, {{many of whom}} were bearing torches and lanthorns, all flocking in the same direction. Following them we found ourselves in the market-place, where crowds of apprentice lads were piling up faggots for a bonfire, while others were broaching two or three great puncheons of ale. The cause of this sudden outbreak of rejoicing was, we learned, that news had just come in that Albemarle's Devonshire militia had partly deserted and partly been defeated at Axminster that very morning. On hearing of our own successful skirmish the joy of the people became more tumultuous than ever. They rushed in amongst us, pouring blessings on our heads, in their strange <b>burring</b> west-country speech, and embracing our horses as well as ourselves. Preparations were soon made for our weary companions. A long empty wool warehouse, thickly littered with straw, was put at their disposal, with a tub of ale and a plentiful supply of cold meats and wheaten bread. For our own part we made our way down East Street through the clamorous hand-shaking crowd to the White Hart Inn, where after a hasty meal we were right glad to seek our couches.

The farm buildings and the wheel-house were all dim and bluish, the apple trees but a blurred wilderness; {{the air smelled of}} woodsmoke from the kitchen fire. One bird going to bed later than the others was uttering a half-hearted twitter, as though surprised at the darkness. From the stable came the snuffle and stamp of a feeding horse. And away over there was the loom of the moor, and away and away the shy stars which had not as yet full light, pricking white through the deep blue heavens. A quavering owl hooted. Ashurst drew a deep breath. What a night to wander out in! A padding of unshod hoofs came up the lane, and three dim, dark shapes passed--ponies on an evening march. Their heads, black and fuzzy, showed above the gate. At the tap of his pipe, and a shower of little sparks, they shied round and scampered. A bat went fluttering past, uttering its almost inaudible [...] "chip, chip." [...] Ashurst held out his hand; on the upturned palm he could feel the dew. Suddenly from overhead he heard little <b>burring</b> boys' voices, little thumps of boots thrown down, and another voice, crisp and soft--the girl's putting them to bed, no doubt; and nine clear words [...] "No, Rick, you can't have the cat in bed"; then came a skirmish of giggles and gurgles, a soft slap, a laugh so low and pretty that it made him shiver a little. A blowing sound, and the glim of the candle which was fingering the dusk above, went out; silence reigned. Ashurst withdrew into the room and sat down; his knee pained him, and his soul felt gloomy.|$|E

He did not turn round, but he heard the gates open, and {{he was convinced that}} he was being watched, if he was not followed. He kept on, however, until he came to some more iron gates, from which stretched the grass avenue which led straight to the gardens of the château. Dimly, through the gathering dusk, he caught a view of it, which was little more than an impression; silver grey and quiet with the peace which the centuries can bring, it seemed to him, with its fantastic towers, and imperfectly visible outline, like a palace of dreams rather than a dwelling house, however magnificent, of material stone and brick. An owl flew out from the trees a few yards to the left of him, and drifted slowly over his head, with much flapping of wings, and a weird, soft call, faintly answered in the distance by his mate; from far away down in the valley came the slow ringing of a single evening bell. Save for these things, a silence almost wonderful reigned. Gradually Wrayson began to feel that sense of soothed nerves, of inexpressible relief, which Nature alone dispenses--her one unequalled drug! All the agitation and turmoil of the last few months seemed to fall away from him. He felt that he had been living in a world of false proportions; that the maze of doubts and fears through which he had wandered was, after all, no part of life itself, merely a tissue of irrelevant issues, to which his distorted imagination had affixed a purely fictitious importance. What concern of his was it how Morris Barnes had lived or died? And who was Bentham that his fate should ever disturb him? The secrets of other people were theirs to keep. His own secret was more wonderful by far. Alone, from amidst the tangle of his other emotions, he felt its survival--more than its survival, its absolute conquest of all other feelings and considerations. It was truth, he knew, that men sought after in the quiet places, and it was the truth which he had found. If he could but see her coming down the avenue, coming to him across the daisy-strewn grass, beneath the shadow of the stately poplars! The very thought set his heart beating like a boy's. He felt the blood singing in his veins, the love-music swelling in his heart. He shook the gates. They, too, were padlocked. Then he listened. There was no sound of any footfall in the road. He moved a few steps higher up, and, making use of the pillars of the gate, he climbed on to the wall. It was a six-foot drop, but he came down noiselessly into a bed of moss. Once more he paused to listen. There was no sound save the <b>burring</b> of some night insect over his head. Stealthily, and keeping {{in the shadow of the}} trees, he began to climb the grassy avenue towards the château.|$|E
