500|$|Midorikawa {{attributed}} {{the success of}} Hotarubi no Mori e {{to the quality of}} the story, noting even those readers of the original manga who were critical of her artwork were drawn to read the story from start to finish. [...] She speculated that hiding Gin's face behind a mask had helped mitigate some of the artistic issues for which her earlier work had been criticized. The intense pressure experienced by Midorikawa early in her manga writing career was relieved as a result of the positive feedback she received upon her success with Hotarubi no Mori e. [...] In 2011, she expressed excitement for the new anime film and having the manga reprinted in a new short story collection, remarking that her attempts to write about her feelings and recent experiences in relation to Hotarubi no Mori e <b>brought</b> <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> her eyes. [...] She described the story as a [...] "precious work" [...] that had help her build social connections.|$|E

500|$|On May 12, 2012, Molly Rainford, a {{contestant}} of {{the sixth}} season of Britain's Got Talent, sang [...] "Ave Maria" [...] during the show's final. Digital Spy's Daniel Sperling noted that Rainford sang a [...] "pimped-up version" [...] of the song which he called [...] "incredible". A writer of BBC Online described her rendition as [...] "moving". On May 28, 2012, Fatai Veamatahau sang [...] "Ave Maria" [...] on The Voice (Australia). Simon Holt of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that [...] "she has a voice which <b>brought</b> <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> many eyes", including coach and mentor Seal's. Coach Joel Madden said: [...] "I have to be respectful. That was a very spiritual performance. I'm {{not sure what it}} was like for people at home, but that felt electric in here". A reviewer for Take 40 Australia called it a [...] "rousing version". Veamatahau's version peaked at number 25 on the Australian Singles Chart for the week of June 10, 2012.|$|E
500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it <b>brought</b> <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. And I remember thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, and I brought it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lefèvre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E
500|$|Russell {{refused to}} attend the {{ceremony}} when his #6 jersey was retired in 1972, or his induction into the Hall of Fame in 1975. While Russell still has sore feelings towards the city, there has {{been something of a}} reconciliation; and he has even visited the city regularly in recent years, something he never did in the years immediately after his retirement. When Russell originally retired, he demanded that his jersey be retired in an empty Boston Garden. In 1995, the Celtics left Boston Garden and entered the FleetCenter, now the TD Garden, and as the main festive act, the Boston organization wanted to re-retire Russell's jersey in front of a sellout audience. Perennially wary of what he long perceived as the racist city of Boston, Russell decided to make amends and gave his approval. On May 6, 1999, the Celtics re-retired Russell's jersey in a ceremony attended by his on-court rival (and friend) Chamberlain, along with Celtics legend Larry Bird and Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The crowd gave Russell a prolonged standing ovation, which <b>brought</b> <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> his eyes. He thanked Chamberlain for taking him to the limit and [...] "making [...] a better player" [...] and the crowd for [...] "allowing [...] {{to be a part of}} their lives." [...] In December 2008, the We Are Boston Leadership Award was presented to Russell.|$|E

500|$|The opening soprano solo in E major, [...] "I {{know that}} my Redeemer liveth" [...] is [...] {{one of the few}} numbers in the oratorio that has {{remained}} unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently <b>brought</b> <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: [...] "Behold, I tell you a mystery", then the long aria [...] "The trumpet shall sound", marked [...] ("dignified but not fast"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of [...] "incorruptible" [...] may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he [...] "could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, [...] "O death, where is thy sting?" [...] The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata , and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus [...] "But thanks be to God".|$|E
2500|$|The remark was spontaneous, and unprepared. As Brody put it, it just [...] "came {{out of my}} heart, at that instant."

2500|$|On 7 October 2009, Grant {{returned}} to Portsmouth as their new Director of football, following {{the purchase of}} the club by Ali al-Faraj. On 26 November 2009, following the release of Paul Hart, Grant was confirmed as the new manager of the club. His first game as manager was a 4–1 defeat at home to Manchester United on 28 November 2009. This was followed by a 4–2 home defeat to Aston Villa in the League Cup. His first win with Pompey arrived in the Premier League on 5 December 2009, with a 2–0 win over Burnley Following this he led Portsmouth to a 2–0 win over Liverpool to bring his new side level on points {{at the foot of the}} table. Although Portsmouth went into administration in March 2010 and had nine points deducted as a result (contributing to their eventual relegation in bottom place), Grant oversaw a run to the FA Cup final which saw them narrowly beaten by his old club Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. On 20 May 2010, Grant resigned as the manager of Portsmouth. He announced his decision to leave in an open letter to fans on the club's website, stating that [...] "it was the hardest decision I have ever had to make". He went on to say that Portsmouth's fans had <b>brought</b> <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> his eyes with their loyalty, devotion and passion for the club.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been waiting for me to come for twenty years. These words <b>brought</b> <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> my eyes, and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second. We could only await the word of the Master of Ceremonies to give us permission to bow ourselves out. A Japanese colonel, our guide, showed us the triumphal arches, the electric light decorations and endless flags. But all this, say the shopkeepers is [...] "made in Osaka"”.|$|E

60|$|Then {{he tried}} to {{convince}} himself that his pet should be left behind; {{but the thought of}} going away from that charming home--which might have been his but for the carelessness in handling the counterfeit money--leaving behind the only friend he had known for many a long day, <b>brought</b> the <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> his eyes again.|$|R

60|$|It was an arm-chair {{of simple}} wood, {{probably}} birch, but of such fine delicacy of grace, standing {{there on the}} sordid stones, it almost <b>brought</b> <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> the eyes.
