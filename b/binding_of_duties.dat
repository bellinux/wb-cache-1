In this paper, we describe algorithms for checking the satisfiability <b>of</b> <b>binding</b> constraints in a business process context. In particular, these algorithms check the configuration of a process-related RBAC model to find satisfiability conflicts. Furthermore, we discuss options to resolve satisfiability conflicts.

We introduce a formal model for constrained workflow systems that incorporate constraints for implementing such policies. We define an entailment constraint, which is defined {{on a pair of}} tasks in a work flow, and show that such constraints can be used to model many familiar authorization policies. We show that a set of entailment constraints can be manipulated algebraically in order to compute all possible dependencies between tasks in the workflow. The resulting set of constraints form the basis for an analysis of the satisfiability of a workflow.

40|$|Abstract. Access {{control is}} a crucial concept in both ICT {{security}} and privacy, providing {{for the protection of}} system resources and personal data. The increasing complexity of nowadays systems has led to a vast family of solutions fostering comprehensive access control models, with the ability to capture a variety of parameters and to incorporate them in the decision making process. However, existing approaches are charac-terised by limitations regarding expressiveness. We present an approach that aims at overcoming such limitations. It is fully based on ontologies and grounded on a rich in semantics information model. The result is a privacy-aware solution that takes into consideration a variety of aspects and parameters, including attributes, context, dependencies between ac-tions and entities participating therein, as well as separation and <b>binding</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> constraints. ...|$|R
40|$|Existing policy {{languages}} {{suffer from}} a limited ability of directly and elegantly expressing high-level access control principles such as history-based separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> [22], <b>binding</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> [26], context constraints [24], Chinese wall properties [10], and obligations [20]. It {{is often difficult to}} extend a language in order to retrofit these features once required or it is necessary to use complicated and complex language constructs to express such concepts. The latter, however, is cumbersome and error-prone for humans dealing with policy administration. We present the flexible policy language OPL that can represent a wide range of access control principles in XML directly, by providing dedicated language constructs for each supported principle. It can be easily extended with further principles if necessary. OPL is based on a module concept, and it can easily cope with the language complexity that usually comes with a growing expressiveness. OPL is suitable to be used in an enterprise environment, since it combines the required expressiveness with the simplicity necessary for an appropriate administration...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{introduce}} a new access control model that aims at addressing the privacy implications surrounding network monitoring. In fact, despite its importance, network monitoring is natively leakage-prone and, moreover, this is exacerbated due {{to the complexity of}} the highly dynamic monitoring procedures and infrastructures, that may include multiple traffic observation points, distributed mitigation mechanisms and even inter-operator cooperation. Conceived on the basis of data protection legislation, the proposed approach is grounded on a rich in expressiveness information model, that captures all the underlying monitoring concepts along with their associations. The model enables the specification of contextual authorisation policies and expressive separation and <b>binding</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> constraints. Finally, two key innovations of our work consist in the ability to define access control rules at any level of abstraction and in enabling a verification procedure, which results in inherently privacy-aware workflows, thus fostering the realisation of the Privacy by Design vision...|$|R

40|$|Workflow {{management}} systems (WFMSs) have attracted {{a lot of}} interest both in academia and the business community. A workflow consists of a collection of tasks that are organized to facilitate some business process specification. To simplify the complexity of security administration, it is common to use role-based access control (RBAC) to grant authorization to roles and users. Typically, security policies are expressed as constraints on users, roles, tasks and the workflow itself. A workflow system can become very complex and involve several organizations or different units of an organization, thus the number of security policies may be very large and their interactions very complex. It is clearly important to know whether the existence of such constraints will prevent certain instances of the workflow from completing. Unfortunately, no existing constraint models have considered this problem satisfactorily. In this paper we define a model for constrained workflow systems that includes local and global cardinality constraints, separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> constraints and <b>binding</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> constraints. We define the notion of a workflow specification and of a constrained workflow authorization schema. Our main result is to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the set of constraints that ensure a sound constrained workflow authorization schema, that is, for any user or any role who are authorized to a task, {{there is at least one}} complete workflow instance when this user or this role executes this task. ...|$|R
40|$|Conscious and {{carefully}} planned {{decision making is}} a part of management containing planning, organization, operative management, motivation and control. All these components of management as well as their effective functioning are dependent on knowledge, data transfer and information processing and holding. If their acquisition is not or cannot be dependent on an activity of deciding subject itself (or dependent on an optional cooperation with other subjects) and data and information are essential and determinant in social point of view, then the third persons must be bound to provide them. A duty to provide such information must be set by legal rules. For purposes of this work, an information duty is specified as a legally <b>binding</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> certain subject to provide information to another subject whose breach results in a rise of legal liability. Objects <b>of</b> this <b>duty</b> are data and information recognized by legal regulations as relevant for control and decision process.

40|$|The UN Framework on Human Rights and Business {{comprises}} the Stateâs duty to protect human rights, the corporate responsibility to respect human rights, and {{the duty to}} remedy abuses. The corporate responsibility to respect rests upon the notion of human rights due diligence. This concept has been highly influential in the latest revision of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises which has, for the first time, adopted a general principle of corporate due diligence in the observance of the corporate social responsibility standards it contains. This paper examines {{the impact of the}} emerging due diligence concept. It argues that its use in relation to social responsibility issues by corporate actors will lead to the creation <b>of</b> <b>binding</b> legal <b>duties,</b> at least at the level of national law. Principles of corporate and tort law can be adapted to this end. More problematic is the reform of international law given the absence of legal personality for corporations. Nonetheless the expectation to apply due diligence that is created by recent international developments has significant implications for the ethical duties and decision-making processes of corporate actors, {{as well as for the}} future development <b>of</b> legally <b>binding</b> <b>duties</b> under International Economic Law...|$|R

Separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> is one <b>of</b> the principles cited as a requirement when setting up these policy-based mechanisms.
