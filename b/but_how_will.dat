25|$|<b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>will</b> this {{solve the}} problem of, given a set of numbers, finding a subset whose product is a square? The {{solution}} uses {{the concept of an}} exponent vector. For example, the prime-power factorization of 504 is 23325071. It can be represented by the exponent vector (3,2,0,1), which gives the exponents of 2, 3, 5, and 7 in the prime factorization. The number 490 would similarly have the vector (1,0,1,2). Multiplying the numbers is the same as componentwise adding their exponent vectors: (504)(490) has the vector (4,2,1,3).|$|E
