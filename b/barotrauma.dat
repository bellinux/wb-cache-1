5|$|In {{addition}} to the cold, the emperor penguin encounters another stressful condition on deep dives—markedly increased pressure of up to 40 {{times that of the}} surface, which in most other terrestrial organisms would cause <b>barotrauma.</b> The bones of the penguin are solid rather than air-filled, which eliminates the risk of mechanical <b>barotrauma.</b>|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} of {{the chest}} wall is commonly among the first signs to appear that <b>barotrauma,</b> damage caused by excessive pressure, has occurred, {{and it is an}} indication that the lung was subjected to significant <b>barotrauma.</b> Thus the phenomenon may occur in diving injuries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barotrauma,</b> {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the <b>barotrauma</b> are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E

5|$|In the United States {{only two}} {{fatalities}} were reported between 2000 and 2004, including {{a man who}} died in North Carolina of <b>barotrauma</b> in 2002. A youth asphyxiated in Vancouver during 2003, and a 27-year-old man in Australia had an embolism after breathing from a cylinder in 2000. Since then two adults asphyxiated in South Florida in 2006, and there were cases in 2009 and 2010, one a Californian youth who was found with a bag over his head, attached to a helium tank, and another teenager in Northern Ireland died of asphyxiation. At Eagle Point, Oregon a teenage girl died in 2012 from <b>barotrauma</b> at a party. A girl from Michigan died from hypoxia later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Inhaling helium {{directly}} from pressurized cylinders or even balloon filling valves is extremely dangerous, as high flow rate and pressure {{can result in}} <b>barotrauma,</b> fatally rupturing lung tissue.|$|E
5|$|Medical procedures, {{such as the}} {{insertion}} of a central venous catheter {{into one of the}} chest veins or the taking of biopsy samples from lung tissue, may lead to pneumothorax. The administration of positive pressure ventilation, either mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation, can result in <b>barotrauma</b> (pressure-related injury) leading to a pneumothorax.|$|E
25|$|Ascent, decompression, and surfacing: {{to ensure}} that {{dissolved}} gases are safely released, that <b>barotraumas</b> of ascent are avoided, {{and that it is}} safe to surface.|$|R
25|$|<b>Barotraumas</b> {{of descent}} {{are caused by}} {{preventing}} the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space {{in contact with the}} diver, resulting in a pressure difference between the tissues and the gas space, and the unbalanced force due to this pressure difference causes deformation of the tissues resulting in cell rupture.|$|R
40|$|Experience from {{treating}} diving accidents {{indicates that}} {{a large proportion of}} divers suffering from pulmonary <b>barotraumas</b> (PBT) or arterial gas embolism (AGE) were engaged in training dives, specifically emergency free ascent (EFA). We tried to verify this relationship and to calculate, if possible, the risk associated with normal recreational dives, training dives, and EFA training dives. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5|$|The {{principal}} conditions are: decompression illness (which covers {{decompression sickness}} and arterial gas embolism); nitrogen narcosis; high pressure nervous syndrome; oxygen toxicity; and pulmonary <b>barotrauma</b> (burst lung). Although {{some of these}} may occur in other settings, they are of particular concern during diving activities.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that <b>barotrauma</b> is causing bat fatalities around wind turbines. Bats have typical mammalian lungs, which {{are thought to}} be more sensitive to sudden air pressure changes than the lungs of birds, making them more liable to fatal rupture. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} bats are attracted to these structures, perhaps seeking roosts, and thereby increasing the death rate. Acoustic deterrents may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farms.|$|E
5|$|To avoid injury during descent, divers must be {{competent}} at equalising the ears, sinuses and mask; {{they must}} also learn not to hold their breath while ascending, to avoid <b>barotrauma</b> of the lungs. The speed of ascent must be controlled to avoid DCS, which requires buoyancy control skills. Good buoyancy control and trim also allow the diver to manoeuvre and move about safely, comfortably and efficiently, using swimfins for propulsion.|$|E
30|$|Three {{randomized}} controlled trials covering 431 participants were included. Patients treated with NMBA showed less mortality (Risk ratio, 0.71 [95 [*]% CI, 0.55 – 0.90]; number needed to treat, 1 – 7), more ventilator free days at day 28 (p[*]=[*] 0.020), higher PaO 2 to FiO 2 ratios (p[*]=[*] 0.004), and less <b>barotraumas</b> (p[*]=[*] 0.030). The incidence of critical illness neuromyopathy was similar (p[*]=[*] 0.540).|$|R
25|$|Equalisation of {{pressure}} in gas spaces to avoid <b>barotraumas.</b> The expansion or compression of enclosed air spaces may cause discomfort or injury while diving. Critically, the lungs {{are susceptible to}} over-expansion and subsequent collapse if a diver holds their breath while ascending: during training divers are taught to never hold their breath while diving. Ear clearing is another critical equalisation procedure, usually requiring conscious intervention by the diver.|$|R
30|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to water and frequent attempt to clean the ear canal predispose swimmers to develop acute otitis externa (swimmer’s ear). Gram-negative bacteria, most commonly pseudomonas, are the major pathogens. Treatment with otic anesthetic/anti-inflammatory/antibiotic/acidifier agents is usually adequate [73]. In rare cases with systemic signs (e.g., fever), oral antibiotics may be necessary [73]. Other less common ear problems in swimmers include otomycosis, exostoses (“surfer’s ear”), traumatic tympanic membrane perforation, otitis media, and <b>barotraumas</b> of the inner ear.|$|R
5|$|If the {{compressed}} {{air in a}} diver's lungs cannot freely escape during an ascent, particularly a rapid one, then the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary <b>barotrauma</b> (PBT). The air may then enter the arterial circulation producing arterial gas embolism (AGE), with effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Although AGE may occur {{as a result of}} other causes, it is most often secondary to PBT. AGE is the second most common cause of death while diving (drowning being the most common stated cause of death). Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms. The following table presents those signs and symptoms which have been observed in more than ten percent of cases diagnosed as AGE, with approximate estimates of frequency.|$|E
5|$|People with TBI are {{provided}} with supplemental oxygen and may need mechanical ventilation. Employment of certain measures such as Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation at higher-than-normal pressures may be helpful in maintaining adequate oxygenation. However, such measures can also increase leakage of air through a tear, and can stress the sutures in a tear that has been surgically repaired; therefore the lowest possible airway pressures that still maintain oxygenation are typically used. Mechanical ventilation can also cause pulmonary <b>barotrauma</b> when high pressure is required to ventilate the lungs. Techniques such as pulmonary toilet (removal of secretions), fluid management, and treatment of pneumonia are employed to improve pulmonary compliance (the elasticity of the lungs).|$|E
5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand {{the effects of the}} diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of <b>barotrauma,</b> DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} is to clear the status of {{recreational}} scuba divers in Japan for promot-ing safety in recreational diving. Methods: A five year (from 1996 to 2001) questionnaire survey was performed of Japanese divers at the Osezaki area in Japan. The subjects of this survey included diving instructors as well as recreational divers. Based on the obtained data, the study investigated the theory predicted incidence of decompression sickness (DCS) among Japanese recreational divers. Results: The average (SD) of the maximum depth for diving was 37. 4 (13. 1) metres, which was deeper than the recommended depth of recreational diving. The incident rate of nitrogen narcosis (12 %) was the most frequent, followed by <b>barotraumas</b> of the ear (11 %) and <b>barotraumas</b> of the para-nasal sinus (5. 6 %). The rate of DCS was 1. 9 % (60 divers) during investigated period, and that DCS occurred once per 19 011 dives in calculation. Conclusions: This investigation showed that the status of leisure diving in Japan is still serious, because DCS would be expected to occur once a weekend in Japan. It is speculated that many divers may develop DCS while moving through high altitudes after diving, particularly at the Osezaki diving spot in Japan. Based on the results of this study, it is emphasised that every Japanese leisure diver shoul...|$|R
30|$|The {{anti-inflammatory}} {{effects of}} heliox, previously reported in ARDS models [14, 18], {{could not be}} reproduced in our model. A clear mechanism on how heliox can affect lung injury markers and histology scoring is not known; however, in healthy volunteers helium resulted in an attenuated expression of inflammatory cell surface markers on leukocytes and platelets in blood [31]. It is postulated that the influence of helium might be via the cell-mediated immunity [32]. Furthermore, ventilation with heliox might lower shear stress and <b>barotraumas</b> and therefore have an anti-inflammatory effect [14]. However, our results indicate {{that there is no}} direct anti-inflammatory effect due to heliox ventilation.|$|R
30|$|The {{advantages}} of spontaneous breathing without intubation include prevention of tears caused by intubation procedures, ventilator-induced <b>barotraumas,</b> and atelectasis. However, intraoperative anesthetic management requires sufficient analgesia {{and prevention of}} cough reflex and body movement, which places more stress on anesthesiologists in comparison with general anesthesia. Non-intubated VATS with regional anesthesia, such as PVB and infiltration anesthesia, causes fewer complications, including unstable postoperative hemodynamics and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), in comparison with general anesthesia [4]. There are no differences in complications or mortality, and pain control is good with regional anesthesia, which contributes to a decreased length of stay in the postoperative recovery unit and early ambulation and discharge from hospital [5].|$|R
5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called <b>barotrauma),</b> or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E

40|$|Airway {{management}} during carinal resection {{should provide}} adequate ventilation and oxygenation {{as well as}} a good surgical field, but without complications such as <b>barotraumas</b> or aspiration. One method of airway management is high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) of one lung or both lungs. We describe a patient undergoing carinal resection, who was managed with HFJV of one lung, using a de-ballooned bronchial blocker of a Univent tube without cardiopulmonary compromise. HFJV of one lung using a bronchial blocker of a Univent tube is a simple and safe method which does not need additional catheters to perform HFJV and enables the position of the stiffer bronchial blocker more stable in airway when employed during carinal resection...|$|R

40|$|An {{interactive}} simulation {{has been developed}} to augment casualty training to non-surgical military physicians and combat medics. Virtual casualties were developed to represent blast injuries from improvised explosive device (IED) detonation, including <b>barotraumas,</b> brain injury, amputations, burns and shrapnel injuries.

Scenarios were developed for training military medical personal how to perform effective multicasualty triage and practice initial care of casualties. These scenarios provide an evolving medical situation in potentially hostile environment. Child and adult civilian casualties are embedded with the military casualties to provide cultural context and enhance realism.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundHigh-frequency oscillatory {{ventilation}} (HFOV) {{is one of}} lung protective {{strategies in}} acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is not recommended {{to be used as}} initial mode of ventilation. Previous studies showed conflicting results for late use of HFOV (after prolonged period of conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV)). This study investigated the use of HFOV as an early therapy (after 24 h of CMV) in the management of ARDS due to burn. Methods 70 burned ARDS patients were ventilated by CMV during the first 24 h (Day 0). Then, patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups (35 each) :Group 1 (G 1 or CMV) : they continued on CMV. Group 2 (G 2 or HFOV) : HFOV was instituted for 72 h (Days 1, 2, 3). Then, patients were shifted to CMV on Day 4 to continue on CMV. Ventilator settings, gas exchange parameters, hemodynamics, sedatives, vasoactive and paralytic requirements, <b>barotraumas</b> and hospital mortality were recorded and compared between the two groups. ResultsIn Day 0 : Demographic data, ventilator settings, gas exchange parameters, and hemodynamics showed no significant difference between both groups. Days 1, 2, 3 : there was statistically significant decrease of FiO 2 and OI accompanied by an increase in PaO 2, PaO 2 /FiO 2 and PaCO 2 in G 2. Day 4 : while both groups on CMV, G 2 patients showed statistically significant decrease in PEEP and mPaw with same gas exchange findings on Days 1, 2, 3 between two groups. During the study period, Hypotension was observed following HFOV in G 2 and was most significant in Day 1. G 2 showed statistically significant increase in <b>barotraumas</b> and required more midazolam, atracurium and norepinephrine. There was no statistically significant difference in 30 days mortality between both groups. ConclusionsEarly HFOV therapy is effective in improving oxygenation in burn patients with ARDS, but it failed to reduce hospital mortality...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: At present, {{vascular}} brachytherapy is {{the only}} efficient therapy for in-stent restenosis.

The non-slippery cutting balloon has the potential to limit vascular <b>barotraumas,</b> which, together with low-dose irradiation {{at both ends of the}} radioactive source, are the prerequisite for geographical miss. This prospective study aimed to examine the efficacy of combining cut-ting balloon angioplasty and brachytherapy for in-stent restenosis. The Radiation in Europe NOvoste (RENO) registry prospectively tracked all patients who had been treated by coronary ß-radiation with the Beta-Cath ™ System (Novoste Corporation, Brussels, Belgium) but were not included in a randomized radiation trial.

40|$|Chiropteran {{monitoring}} {{has become}} an important public concern given that wind turbines pose the threat of injury or death to bats through direct impact or <b>barotraumas.</b> Such monitoring therefore requires robust methodology to assess the local density, temporal activity, and diversity of bats. This work develops machine learning based monitoring ap-proach for nocturnal flight activity of bats. It consists of Ultrasound Acoustic Monitoring System (UAMS) and thermal-Infrared Imaging Monitoring System (IIMS), the former for identification of bat echolocation calls and the latter for assessing flight characteristics. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques were used for UAMS and IIMS, respectively. The proposed methodology was tested with real data collected during 2011 spring and fall migration around Lake Erie in Ohio. The research will be helpful for biolo-gists and decision makers to rapidly but effectively asses bat density, activity, and diversity within natural areas or proposed wind development sites...|$|R
