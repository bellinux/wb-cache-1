5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If I Could Do It All Over Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to enrol him as producer.|$|E
5|$|Anthony first appears when he poses as {{a member}} of the Walford council to help Eddie eject a {{squatter}} from a premises that they want to move their antiques business into. He then decides to remain in Walford and helps his father set up the business. Anthony buys some candlesticks from Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), though she does not know their true value, but when Cora finds out their true value, she accuses Anthony of scamming her. Eddie sells the candlesticks for £8000, and when Tyler decides to take part in an unlicensed boxing match, Michael convinces Anthony that Tyler will win and that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to place a bet on him, knowing that Anthony suffers with a gambling addiction. Anthony steals £8000 from Eddie's safe, but bets on Tyler's opponent Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee), which leaves Michael unimpressed, as he has researched Artie and found out he is tough. During the fight, however, Tyler narrowly wins so Anthony has to confess to Eddie that he has lost the money. Shortly after he does, Tyler collapses and has a seizure, so is rushed to hospital. Eddie is sickened by Anthony's actions and tells him he wishes he was dying in a hospital bed, rather than Tyler. Distraught, Anthony storms out and attends a party run by Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), culminating in him kissing her. Afterwards, Anthony returns to the hospital to learn that Tyler has been taken for a life-saving operation and is furious that Eddie was not around. Eddie then admits that his children would be better off without him. Tyler survives and recovers, but the brothers are told by Eddie that Michael set up an unfair fight to punish the family, leading Tyler and Anthony to reject Michael. Eddie then leaves Walford, leaving Tyler and Anthony the antiques business.|$|E
25|$|White House {{correspondent}} Seth Kantor — who was {{a passenger}} in the motorcade — testified that after President Kennedy was shot, he had visited Parkland Hospital while the wounded President was receiving care. Kantor said that {{as he entered the}} hospital, at about 1:30 pm, he felt a tug on his coat. He turned around to see Jack Ruby who called him by his first name and shook his hand; {{he said that he had}} become acquainted with Ruby while he was a reporter for the Dallas Times Herald newspaper. According to Kantor, Ruby asked him if he thought that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> for him to close his nightclubs for the next three nights because of the tragedy and Kantor responded with thinking that doing so would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|E

25|$|By 1909 it was {{determined}} that improvements needed to be made to the fleet. Since the design of the Composites was heavily influenced by both elevated equipment and railroad coaches of the time, the cars featured only two doors at the extreme ends of the subway car. It {{was determined}} that adding a center door for improved passenger flow would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> This required removing the transverse seats which faced each other {{in the center of the}} car. After the modification, passenger seating would be in the longitudinal direction (along the sides of the car) only. This created more room for standees. This modification was completed on the cars by 1912.|$|E

25|$|Law {{enforcement}} in the Moro Province was difficult. Outlaws {{would go to}} ground at their home cottas, requiring an entire troop of police or soldiers to arrest them. There was always the danger of a full-fledged battle breaking out during such an arrest, and this led to many known outlaws going unpunished. In 1911, Pershing resolved to disarm the Moros. Army Chief of Staff Leonard Wood (former Moro Province governor) disagreed with this plan, stating that the move was ill-timed and that the Moros would hide their best arms, turning in only their worst. Pershing waited until roads into the interior had been completed, so that government troops could protect disarmed Moros from holdouts. He conferred with the Datus, who mostly agreed that disarmament would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> – provided that everybody disarmed.|$|E
25|$|By the 1966-67 season, the {{interest}} in cricket in India had risen to unprecedented levels. Despite being beaten by the West Indies at home, the Indian team's spirits were not dampened. The captain Nawab of Pataudi {{thought that it would}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to introduce more quality spinners into the team in order to compensate for the absence of good new-ball bowlers in the country. Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, the leg spinner, had already established his place in the team with solid performances against Australia and the West Indies. Erapalli Prasanna was making him comeback having been out of the team for five years, while both Venkatarghavan and Bedi played in the series against West Indies. All four of them played their first (and only game together) against England at Birmingham in the summer of 1967. Prasanna and Chandrasekhar impressed in that game, claiming 7 and 6 wickets respectively, and all four bowlers bowled a tight line. Even though these four bowlers continued to play for 11 more years, this remained the only Test where all of them featured in the Indian test XI.|$|E
25|$|The Intelligence to Prevent Terrorism Act was {{introduced}} to the Senate on September 28 by Senators Bob Graham (D-FL) and Jay Rockefeller (D-WV). The bill proposed a number of changes relating to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). The most significant change proposed was to require the Attorney General or head of any other Federal department or agency to disclose to the DCI any foreign intelligence acquired {{in the course of a}} criminal investigation. However, it would also have required that the DCI and Secretary of the Treasury jointly report to Congress as to whether it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to reconfigure the Office of Foreign Assets Control and its Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center to provide for the analysis and dissemination of foreign intelligence relating to the financial capabilities and resources of international terrorist organizations. It would also have required the DCI to establish and maintain a National Virtual Translation Center for timely and accurate translations of foreign intelligence for elements of the intelligence community. Another area it covered was a proposal to make the Attorney General provide a program of training to Government officials regarding the identification and use of foreign intelligence.|$|E

500|$|In January 1981, Tyndall was {{contacted}} by far-right activist Ray Hill, {{who had become}} an informant for the anti-fascist magazine Searchlight. Hill suggested that Tyndall establish a new political party through which he could unite many smaller extreme-right groups. While Hill's real intention had been to cause a further schism among the British far-right and thus weaken it, Tyndall deemed his suggestion to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> Tyndall made suggestions of unity {{to a number of}} other small extreme-right groups and together they established a Committee for Nationalist Unity (CNU) in January 1982.|$|E
500|$|Conception of {{the episode}} {{originated}} in two visual images series creator Chris Carter had wanted to include in a script [...] "since {{the beginning of the}} show". The first of these was that of a deep-sea diver finding a still-living pilot trapped in the wreckage of a World War II-era fighter plane; and the second was that of a black-and-white flashback taking place in a submarine. Director Rob Bowman shared with Carter his experiences diving, feeling that an episode based on finding [...] "something creepy" [...] underwater would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> Carter also wanted the episode to feature the re-emergence of the [...] "MJ documents" [...] last seen in the earlier [...] "Paper Clip".|$|E
