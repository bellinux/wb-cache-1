5000|$|The Jenson roman was an {{explicitly}} typographic letter designed on its {{own terms}} that declined to imitate the appearance of hand-lettering. Its effect is one of a unified cohesive whole, a seamless fusion of style with structure, and the successful convergence of the long progression of preceding letter styles. Jenson adapted the structural unity and component-based modular integration of Roman capitals to humanistic minuscule forms by masterful abstract stylization. The carefully modelled serifs follow an artful logic of asymmetry. The ratio of extender lengths to letter bodies and the distance between lines results in balanced, harmonious <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>type.</b> Jenson also mirrors the ideal expressed in renaissance painting of carving up space (typographic [...] "white space") with figures (letters) to articulate {{the relationship between the two}} and make the white space dynamic.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Many {{scholars}} {{have developed a}} lot of flexible modules used on Hydraulic press, but to reduce costs such as the producing cost and the transportation cost, the above modules, formed through continuation, should be optimized before put into the module library. This paper introduces a method which optimizes the continuation <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> YH 30 by means of LSRM. And the contrast shows the new nodule has a well effect on optimizing structure and reducing costs and materials. Foreword Hydraulic press is a common device used in manufacturing. Both internal and overseas designers have developed many flexible modules, which formed through continuation, but not consider the costs of manufacturing and transportation during designing, so the modules only have partial functions and should be optimized before put into the module library to save the costs and the materials. Discussions on structure optimization have been taken at the view of static and dynamic separately. Before optimization, {{it is necessary to}} design the function between the design variables and the target variables. This paper introduces a method which optimizes the continuation <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> YH 30 by means of LSRM and makes a contrast between the modules befor...|$|E

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} {{is a condition}} that cumulatively costs around $ 14. 9 billion in medical expenses {{every year in the}} United States. Besides being costly, the monitoring of this disease is invasive, painful, and often embarrassing to the afflicted individual; blood and urine testing is currently the daily method of monitoring blood glucose and ketone levels in the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> 1 diabetics. Though the use of these samples is standard, another avenue for possibly determining blood glucose has not been completely explored. With over 3000 chemicals reportedly found in exhaled human breath, biomarkers associated with this disorder and many of the complications caused by it may exist and could be utilized in lieu of blood and urine samples. To examine breath for these markers our lab employs Terahertz radiation. Unlike competing methods of gas testing, the high specificity, speed of testing, and small sample size that the Terahertz spectral range affords is ideal for the medical field. Presented here are both the spectral assignments and the most recent results of our investigation into the exhaled biomarkers of type 1 diabetics utilizing Terahertz spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} different reconstruction intervals of retrospectively electrocardiographically (ECG) -gated multi-detector row computed tomographic (CT) angiography on image quality of different segments of various types of coronary artery bypass grafts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with 62 grafts underwent retrospectively ECG-gated four-channel multi-detector row CT angiography and conventional coronary angiography. Raw helical CT data were reconstructed at 0 %- 90 % of the cardiac cycle in increments of 10 %. Each graft was separated into three segments (proximal segment, graft body, and distal anastomosis). Three graft types were identified according to site of distal anastomosis. Two readers assessed image quality of segments and graft types. Effective radiation dose was calculated. RESULTS: Best image quality of all segments was obtained at a reconstruction interval of 50 %- 70 % of the cardiac cycle. Image quality of the proximal segment did not vary significantly with different reconstruction intervals (analysis of variance, P =. 8), whereas image quality of the graft body and distal anastomosis changed significantly with varying reconstruction intervals (P <. 001). Distal anastomosis and body of types 1 and 2 grafts were best seen at 60 %- 70 % of the cardiac cycle, whereas distal anastomosis and <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> 3 grafts were best visualized at 50 %. Accuracy of CT angiography for detection of graft patency was 94 % for reader 1 and 95 % for reader 2. Effective dose for CT was 11. 4 mSv {{for both men and}} women. Mean effective dose for angiography was 2. 1 mSv for men and women. CONCLUSION: Optimal selection of reconstruction interval improves image quality of the graft body and of distal anastomosis in particular...|$|E
