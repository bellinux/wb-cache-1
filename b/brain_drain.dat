5|$|Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated {{blood from}} the brain. The brain has two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface of}} the cerebrum that has three branches, and an interior network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins. The veins of the <b>brain</b> <b>drain</b> into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull. Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins.|$|E

5|$|The album {{begins with}} two cover songs, and {{features}} a third on Side 2. Lyrics circle various themes, while the structuring {{of the songs}} shifted towards hard rock, psychedelic rock. The album was deemed by critics to {{be an attempt to}} retreat to the band's roots and received mostly positive reviews. Subterranean Jungle was not very successful commercially, peaking at number 83 on the US Billboard 200 and failing to chart internationally. The singles released from the album did not chart either. This is the last album by the band to feature Marky Ramone on drums until the 1989 album <b>Brain</b> <b>Drain.</b>|$|E

Its rural nature has caused many nurses and doctors loose {{interest}} of serving in its facilities. This study sought to describe factors that can influence retention especially of nurses in the rural health facilities of the Eastern Cape Province and develop recommendations for nurse managers on how to retain nurses in rural areas. The major inferences drawn from {{this study is that}} nurses are dissatisfied with lack of promotional opportunities, lack of professional support, facing drastic responsibilities but with less income, tremendous workloads, emotional demands and unrealistic salary package.

40|$|AbstractAfter the {{admission}} into the European Union in 2007 Romania started {{to benefit from}} transnational academic programs financed by the European Union. These programs are designed to develop the human resources from Eastern European academic communities and to avoid the <b>brain</b> <b>draining</b> phenomena. But the question is: can these EU funded grants improve the scientific level of the researchers from former Eastern European communist countries? Our survey tried to reveal how effective one of these EU transnational grants in Romania was {{and to develop a}} conceptual frame for this new educational environment in Romania and in Eastern Europe in general. The methods used are specific to the concept of focus group. The target group elected, in which I was a member for 12 months, with 6 months extension, was a group of postdoctoral researchers from a transnational EU funded grant destined to communicate science to the general public. By its status, this grant involved transnational academic exchanges and, among other parameters, we considered the number of ISI articles published by the researchers and {{the admission}} to ISI rated international conferences.

40|$|The rate of {{academic}} emigration from Israel to the United States is unparalleled {{in the western}} world. Just the number of Israelis in the top 40 American departments in physics, chemistry, philosophy, computer science and economics, {{as a percentage of}} their remaining colleagues in Israel, is over twice the overall academic emigration rates (at all levels) from European countries. A significantly poorer Israel managed, in the 1950 s and 60 s, to raise the number {{of academic}} research personnel per capita to nearly American levels by the mid- 1970 s. A much wealthier Israel then changed its national priorities, causing a 35 % decline in this number between 1976 and 2005, compared to a 29 % increase in the States during this period. Since the mid- 1970 s, the absolute number of senior academic staff positions in Israel’s universities has remained nearly unchanged – and has actually declined in its leading universities. This despite a 355 % {{increase in the number of}} degrees conferred per capita. The steady multi-decade per capita reduction in faculty positions (even when including the non-research colleges), the constant erosion in salaries and stagnation fed by an absence of strategic vision at the national level, combined with a pervasive culture of micro-management, are all part of a massive policy breakdown that has resulted in one of the greatest academic <b>brain</b> <b>drains</b> on record – this, from a country with no natural resources and existential threats to its national security...|$|R

Historical research design was used in the study. The paper therefore examined the origin of Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria, cases of Boko Haram and its implications for sustainable and educational development of the North Central Nigeria. The study showed numerous effects of Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria to include economical, political and social as well as educational in Northern states of Nigeria. Economically, the nature and operation in the area of economic activities of the states concerned are dead resulting to migration of people from the affected places to other areas due to restiveness.

40|$|Introduction: Solutes {{injected}} into the interstitial fluid (ISF) of mouse <b>brains</b> <b>drain</b> along basement membranes of capillaries and arteries in a pattern that closely resembles the deposition of amyloid-? in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Injected particles (fluorospheres) expand peripheral perivascular spaces {{in a similar way}} to the dilatation of perivascular spaces by fluid in the cerebral white matter in Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we test the hypothesis that the drainage route for ISF in vascular basement membranes connects with drainage pathways at the periphery of arteries. Materials and methods: Soluble dextran or 0. 02 ?m fluorospheres were {{injected into}} brains of 109 mice; animals were fixed by perfusion at intervals up to 1 week. The effect of inflammation was tested by co-injection of the tracers with LPS or kainic acid. The distribution of tracers was characterized using immunofluorescence, image analysis and confocal microscopy. Results: Soluble dextran spread progressively along capillary and artery basement membranes over 3 – 24 h to leptomeningeal arteries and radially through arterial walls to be taken up by perivascular cells. No spread occurred when tracer was injected into dead animals. Following injection, 0. 02 ?m fluorospheres expanded spaces at the periphery of arteries and capillaries and were ingested by perivascular cells. Co-injection with LPS or kainic acid resulted in wider distribution of soluble and particulate tracers. Conclusions: These results suggest that antigens draining in ISF along vascular basement membranes may enter pathways at the periphery of arteries and be sampled by perivascular cells. This interconnection may also help to explain the distribution of amyloid-? in CAA and of fluid around arteries in the white matter in Alzheimer’s disease...|$|R
