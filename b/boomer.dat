5|$|Caprica-Six and <b>Boomer</b> {{are next}} shown conversing with Number Three. While the three move up a stairwell, {{explosives}} {{set by the}} resistance led by Samuel T. Anders (Michael Trucco) detonate, trapping Anders, Three, <b>Boomer,</b> and Caprica-Six in a parking garage. While Anders is originally shielded and hidden by the blast, Caprica-Six breaks her leg. Number Three offers to euthanize her, but Caprica-Six refuses as she suspects that Number Three will {{take the opportunity to}} box her. Shortly afterwards, the three find Anders who Number Three intends to kill before being stopped by <b>Boomer</b> and Caprica-Six. As Number Three goads them, <b>Boomer</b> and Caprica-Six understand that their unique view of humanity through their love for Baltar and Galen Tyrol gives them a perspective that makes them a threat to the Cylon status-quo. When Number Three attempts to kill Anders, she is killed by Caprica-Six who, along with <b>Boomer,</b> allow Anders to escape. Recognizing that it will take some time for Number Three to resurrect and report them, Caprica-Six and <b>Boomer</b> form a pact to change the Cylon perspective of humanity together before finally being rescued from the collapsed parking garage by the other Cylons.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{original}} version having been broadcast on PBS, a pilot episode for an American version (known as Red Dwarf USA) was produced through Universal Studios {{with the intention of}} broadcasting on NBC in 1992.
