5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery <b>between</b> <b>its</b> headwaters and Reservoir Road. Between Reservoir Road and {{the mouth of the}} creek, it {{is considered}} to be a Coldwater Fishery. The upper reaches of the creek, <b>between</b> <b>its</b> headwaters and a point slightly downstream of where it enters Schuylkill County are considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters and the rest of the creek's length is considered to be Approved Trout Waters. The upper reaches of the creek were Class A Wild Trout Waters in 1976 before becoming Class D Wild Trout Waters in 1984. This change was due to acid mine drainage and sediment buildup. However, the creek rebounded to Class A Wild Trout Waters by 1997. The creek is considered to be Class D Wild Trout Waters between T431 and T435. The tributary Trexler Run is also considered to be Class A Wild Trout Waters throughout its length.|$|E

30|$|Reviews and meta-analyses {{confirm that}} ITS {{technologies}} frequently improve learning over classroom teaching, reading texts, and/or other traditional learning methods. These meta-analyses typically report effect sizes (signified by d), which {{refer to the}} difference <b>between</b> the <b>ITS</b> condition and a control condition, calibrated in standard deviation units. The reported meta-analyses show positive effect sizes that vary from d[*]=[*] 0.05 (Dynarsky et al. 2007; Steenbergen-Hu and Cooper 2014) to d[*]=[*] 1.08 (Dodds and Fletcher 2004), but most hover between d[*]=[*] 0.40 and d[*]=[*] 0.80 (Kulik and Fletcher 2015; Ma et al. 2014; Steenbergen-Hu and Cooper 2013; VanLehn 2011). A reasonable meta-meta estimate from all of these meta-analyses is d[*]=[*] 0.60. This performance is comparable to human tutoring, which varies between d[*]=[*] 0.42 (Cohen et al. 1982) and d[*]=[*]. 80 (VanLehn 2011), depending on the expertise of the tutor. Human tutors have not varied greatly from ITSs in direct comparisons <b>between</b> <b>ITSs</b> and trained human tutors (Graesser 2016; Olney et al. 2012; VanLehn 2011; VanLehn et al. 2007).|$|R

5|$|Messers Run is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery, as is its tributary Negro Hollow.

The larva of the Australian horsefly (Scaptia muscula) lives in antlion (for example Myrmeleon pictifrons) pit traps and feeds on the prey caught, and the female chalcid wasp (Lasiochalcidia igiliensis) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing <b>between</b> <b>its</b> head and thorax.|$|E
