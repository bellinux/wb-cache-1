40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} effect of {{intramuscular}} <b>barium</b> <b>selenate</b> on the blood selenium concentration of horses with marginal selenium status. METHODS: Eighteen mares were assigned to one of six groups. The mares in groups 1 - 4 received <b>barium</b> <b>selenate</b> at 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0 and 1. 5 mg Se/kg, respectively, injected into the right pectoral muscle mass. The mares in group 5 received sodium selenate at 0. 05 mg Se/kg orally at 8 -week intervals. The mares in group 6 were left untreated. Blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 days after the initial treatment for assay of whole blood and plasma selenium. Injection site reactions were recorded on each sampling date. RESULTS: Treatment with <b>barium</b> <b>selenate</b> at each dose rate significantly increased whole blood, plasma and blood cell selenium concentrations when compared to no treatment or oral treatment with sodium selenate, and maintained group mean whole blood selenium concentrations in the adequate range (> 1600 nmol/l) {{until the end of the}} experimental period of 1 year. The severity of injection site reactions increased with dose rate but was considered acceptable alt the lower dose rates used. CONCLUSION: The injection of <b>barium</b> <b>selenate</b> placed aseptically at a deep intramuscular site was efficacious in correcting the selenium status of mares grazing pasture with a selenium content of 0. 01 - 0. 07 mg/kg DM. However, some swelling and fibrosis at the injection site was apparent at all dose rates used. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There is currently no long-acting selenium supplementation product licensed in New Zealand for use in horses. <b>Barium</b> <b>selenate</b> promises to provide a useful method for selenium supplementation for horses, with an effective duration of at least 1 year following a single injection.

40|$|Liver {{and kidney}} copper (Cu) and {{selenium}} (Se) concentrations were studied over a 7 -month period after parenteral supplementation using Cu heptonate and <b>barium</b> (Ba) <b>selenate</b> in 44 8 -month-old South African (SA) Mutton Merino wethers. Responses in plasma Cu and blood Se concentrations, {{as well as}} fecundity were also measured in a breeding flock of SA Mutton Merino ewes for 3 consecutive years. The effect of maternal supplementation with Cu and Se was assessed in terms of biochemical parameters and production responses in 654 lambs produced by these ewes. Parenteral treatments with Cu and Se raised liver and kidney concentrations (P ≤ 0, 05) for up to 7 months in wethers under conditions where liver Cu and Se respectively declined to concentrations below 30 mg/kg DM and 300 μg/kg dry matter (DM) in spring. Plasma Cu concentrations of breeding ewes which received Cu heptonate were increased (P ≤ 0, 05) by 18 % relative to the control group in which concentrations declined to 91 ug/dl during late pregnancy. Blood Se concentrations of control ewes exceeded 200 ng/ml, and were unaffected by parenteral Se supplementation. Survival of progeny of Cu heptonate treated ewes tended (P ≤ 0, 10) to be improved by 13 % (0, 68 vs 0, 60). This tendency was accompanied by generally higher (P ≤ 0, 10) plasma Cu concentrations of these lambs relative to control lambs at 10 - 20 and 45 - 55 d of age. Lambs of Cu supplemented ewes that died prior to weaning, had higher (P ≤ 0, 05) liver Cu concentrations than control group contemporaries. Maternal supplementation with Ba selenate enhanced (P ≤ 0, 05) lamb live mass at 8 weeks by 7. 4 % relative to control group lambs, but did not affect weaning mass. Lambs born to dams receiving Ba selenate and which died prior to weaning, had 20 % higher (P ≤ 0, 05) liver Se concentrations than control group lambs. Parenteral treatment of sheep with Ba selenate and Cu heptonate was effective in improving liver Cu and Se concentrations of experimental animals. This led to an economic benefit {{in the case of}} the response in lamb survival to Cu supplementation. Under more demanding conditions in terms of Cu and Se availability, marked economic benefits are expected after parenteral supplementation. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Selenium (Se) {{deficiency}} {{has been}} associated with lowered resistance to mastitis in dairy cattle. However, little published data exists on the effect of Se supplementation before calving on udder health of pastured dairy heifers. Further, the relative efficacy of injectable <b>barium</b> <b>selenate</b> and oral organic Se for improving udder health in cows has not previously been tested. The objectives of this study were {{to determine the effects of}} precalving Se supplementation and type of supplementation on the blood activity of glutathione peroxidase and measures of udder health immediately after calving and during the first month of lactation in pastured dairy heifers. One hundred forty pregnant Chilean Holstein-Friesian heifers were fed a basal diet containing, on average, 0. 15 mg of Se/kg of dry matter. One month before predicted calving, heifers were allocated to 1 of 3 groups. Group 1 (n = 49) received no supplementary Se, group 2 (n = 46) received a single subcutaneous injection of Se (1 mg/kg of live weight, as <b>barium</b> <b>selenate),</b> and group 3 (n = 45) was fed Se yeast (3 mg/heifer/d until calving). Heifers supplemented with <b>barium</b> <b>selenate</b> had a higher glutathione peroxidase activity from 14 d in milk onwards. Selenium supplementation, irrespective of source, tended to reduce the prevalence of intramammary infection (IMI) and decrease the prevalence of quarters with high somatic cell count (SCC) at calving. Overall, Se supplementation did not result in a reduction of the incidence of new IMI or clinical mastitis or in decreased SCC during the balance of the first month of lactation. However, in pasture-based heifers injected with <b>barium</b> <b>selenate</b> before calving, and fed diets with 1. 3 and 2. 5 mg of Se/d precalving and during lactation, respectively, no cases of clinical mastitis were observed in the first month of lactation.

Plasma selenium of their calves was determined at birth and 60, 120 and 180 d postpartum. During year 1 (1997), calf plasma selenium concentrations at birth {{were at a}} critical level (0. 03 mg L- 1) for the control, but below adequacy (0. 07 mg L- 1) for the control, Mu-Se and Deposel treatments. Calves from the two free-choice mineral treatments had an average plasma concentration of 0. 06 mg L- 1, which is borderline to adequate (0. 07 mg L- 1). At 60, 120 and 180 d, the control, Mu-Se and Deposel treatments were below critical level concentrations, whereas the averages for the free-choice mineral mixtures were at or above adequacy. During year 2 (1998), the control was below critical plasma concentrations at all times, while Mu-Se and Deposel treatments were at critical level at birth and 60 d of age and below the critical level thereafter. The two free-choice mineral mixtures were higher (P< 0. 05) than all other treatments with average borderline concentrations (0. 055 mg L- 1) at birth and near adequate values (0. 065 mg L- 1) {{the rest of the}} time. In general, the control and the two injectable inorganic treatments resulted in reduced calf plasma selenium concentrations with time and at no time were adequate.

40|$|A {{commercial}} fertiliser, {{consisting of}} a poorly soluble <b>barium</b> <b>selenate</b> core with a coating of highly soluble sodium selenite, was evaluated in 2 trials {{for the provision of}} selenium (Se) to grazing sheep. The fertiliser was administered at a level of 1 kg per hectare to 3 of 6 kikuyu paddocks during 1995 and 1996 in Trial 1, while the other paddocks were left untreated. The Se status of SA mutton merino ram lambs, as reflected by whole blood, liver and kidney Se concentrations, was elevated (P&lt; 0. 01) for at least 5 months after application of the fertiliser. Whole blood and liver Se concentrations of animals grazing unfertilised control paddocks were indicative of a subclinical Se deficiency at times (&lt; 100 ng Se/mℓ whole blood and &lt; 300 mg Se/kg liver dry matter). In Trial 2, 4 of 7 paddocks on which an oat fodder crop was established were treated with the Se fertiliser during 1995 and 1997. The remaining 3 paddocks were left unfertilised as controls. Groups of 10 - 15 pregnant SA mutton merino ewes were introduced to these paddocks within 2 weeks of parturition. These ewes and their progeny utilised these paddocks for a mean (+SD) period of 41 + 8 days after parturition. The whole blood Se concentrations of these ewes and their offspring were elevated (P &lt; 0. 01) relative to their contemporaries utilising control paddocks. No suggestion of a subclinical Se deficiency was discernible in animals grazing control paddocks, although whole blood Se levels approached 100 ng Se/mℓ during 1997. The application of Se fertiliser did not result in improvements in ewe reproduction or lamb growth. There was a suggestion of an improvement (P = 0. 21) in mean (+SE) lamb survival on paddocks receiving Se fertiliser compared to control paddocks (71. 5 + 4. 6 % vs 62. 2 + 5. 3 % respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} grazing pasture that had a low selenium (Se) concentration on serum concentrations of triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4), and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in dairy cows. METHODS: Forty pregnant Friesian cows were grazed on pasture that contained 0. 03 - 0. 04 ppm Se on a dry matter (DM) basis. Two months before parturition, 20 cows were randomly selected and treated with 1 mg Se/kg bodyweight subcutaneously, as <b>barium</b> <b>selenate</b> (Group Se-S). The other group (Se-D) was not supplemented. Blood samples were taken before supplementation (- 60 days) and 30, 60, 90, 180 and 270 days after parturition, for determination of concentrations of T 3 and T 4 in serum, and GSH-Px activity in erythrocytes. RESULTS: Erythrocyte GSH-Px activity in the Se-D group was 130 U/g Hb throughout lactation. Mean serum concentrations of T 4 in Se-D and Se-S cows increased from 23. 7 (SEM 0. 7) and 23. 4 (SEM 0. 8) nmol/L, respectively, in the prepartum period to 69. 6 (SEM 0. 1) and 67. 6 (SEM 0. 2) nmol/L, respectively, at 180 days of lactation (p< 0. 01), and no effect of Se supplementation was evident. Serum concentrations of T 3 in Se-D cows decreased (p< 0. 05) from 1. 6 (SEM 0. 1) nmol/L prepartum to 1. 0 (SEM 0. 2) nmol/L at the beginning of lactation, and remained lower (p< 0. 05) than those in the Se-S cows which did not decrease after calving and ranged from 1. 9 (SEM 0. 1) to 2. 4 (SEM 0. 2) nmol/L throughout lactation. CONCLUSIONS: Serum T 3 concentrations decreased during early lactation in unsupplemented cows grazing pastures low in Se (0. 03 - 0. 04 ppm) and both serum T 3 and erythrocyte GSH-Px activities were consistently lower throughout lactation compared with Se-supplemented cows. Se supplementation had no effect on serum T 4 concentrations...|$|E

(<b>barium</b> <b>selenate,</b> long lasting) and Mu-Se? (sodium selenite, short lasting). Plasma selenium levels {{increased in the}} two salt mineral mix treatments, whereas in the Mu-Se treatment the values decreased, while the Deposel was able to maintain selenium concentrations. Plasma concentrations in the control were below critical levels (0. 03 g/ml) {{at the end of}} the experiment (24 mo) and at the critical level at 18 mo. Plasma values in the Mu-Se treatment were at critical levels at 18 mo and above critical but below adequate at the start and at 6, 12 and 24 mo. The Deposel treatment attained adequacy (0. 07 ?g/ml) in plasma selenium at 6 mo and at no time was less than the critical level (0. 03 g/ml). Liver selenium concentrations of the control did not attain adequate levels (1. 2 mg/kg) during the 2 years, and even though the Deposel treatment reached adequacy only at 24 mo the trend for this treatment was to increase liver selenium concentrations with time. The Mu-Se treatment at no time presented adequate concentrations. The two free-choice salt mineral mixture treatments were found to provide adequate selenium in liver at 6, 12 and 24 mo after treatment began. Colostrum selenium concentrations decreased from the first to the second year, and at no time did any treatment reach adequacy (0. 1 mg/L). Milk selenium concentrations declined from 60 to 180 days in the control during the first year, but the concentrations tended to be maintained in all supplemented treatments. During the second year, the selenium concentrations for the Mu-Se treatment declined, while the concentrations were maintained in the Deposel and both free-choice mineral mixture treatments. Deposel provided long lasting reliable protection from selenium deficiency while the yeast form of selenium provided continuous and highest levels of blood, liver and milk selenium concentrations. ]]...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin E and {{selenium}} {{have been}} reported to improve immune function across a range of species. Ewes lambing on poor-quality dry pasture in autumn in Western Australia are at risk of being deficient in vitamin E and selenium at lambing thus predisposing their lambs to deficiencies and increasing the risk of infection and disease. This study tested the hypotheses that (i) supplementation of autumn-lambing ewes with vitamin E plus selenium in late gestation will increase the concentrations of vitamin E and selenium in plasma in the ewe and lamb and (ii) that the increased concentrations of vitamin E and selenium in plasma in the lambs will improve their innate and adaptive immune responses and thus survival. Pregnant Merino ewes were divided into a control group (n= 58) which received no supplementation or a group supplemented with vitamin E plus selenium (n= 55). On days 111, 125 and 140 of pregnancy ewes in the vitamin E plus selenium group were given 4 g all-rac-α-tocopherol acetate orally. On day 111 the ewes were also given 60 mg of selenium as <b>barium</b> <b>selenate</b> by subcutaneous injection. The concentrations of α-tocopherol and selenium were measured in ewes and/or lambs from day 111 of pregnancy to 14 weeks of age± 10 days (weaning). Immune function of the lamb was assessed by analysing the numbers and phagocytic capacities of monocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes and plasma IgG and anti-tetanus toxoid antibody concentrations between birth and 14 weeks of age± 10 days. Maternal supplementation with vitamin E plus selenium increased the concentration of α-tocopherol in plasma (1. 13 v. 0. 67 mg/l; P< 0. 001) and selenium in whole blood (0. 12 v. 0. 07 mg/l; P< 0. 01) of the ewes at lambing compared with controls. Supplementation also increased the concentration of α-tocopherol (0. 14 v. 0. 08 mg/l; P< 0. 001) and selenium (0. 08 v. 0. 05 mg/l; P< 0. 01) in lambs at birth compared with controls.
