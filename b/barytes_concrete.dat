40|$|Concrete {{mix design}} criteria, based on {{existing}} theories of proportioning and specifically oriented toward {{the solution of}} radiation shielding problems, were developed. Effects of aggregate gradation, cement-to- aggregate ratio, and water content were examined. A <b>barytes</b> <b>concrete,</b> designed according to these criteria, was thoroughly investigated in the Lid Tank Shielding Facility. Relative effectivenesses of dry aggregates, aggregates plus cement, and cured concrete were compared through thermal-neutron flux, fast- neutron dose, and gamma-ray dose measurements behind slab configurations. Attenuation was measured for the aggregate, the aggregate plus cement, and for the <b>barytes</b> <b>concrete.</b> Comparison with attenuations calculated {{on the basis of}} removal cross sections for the measured chemical compositions showed satisfactory agreement.

40|$|The TRADE {{project is}} based on the {{coupling}} of, in a sub-critical configuration, of a 115 MeV, 2 mA proton cyclotron with a TRIGA research reactor at the ENEA Casaccia centre (Rome). Detailed radioprotection calculations using the FLUKA and EA-MC Monte Carlo codes were performed during the feasibility study. The study concentrated on dose rates due to beam losses in normal operating conditions and in the calculation of activation in the most sensitive components of the experiment. Results show that a shielding of 1. 4 m of <b>barytes</b> <b>concrete</b> around the beam line will be sufficient to maintain the effective doses below the level of 10 Mu Sv/h, provided that the beam losses are at the level of 10 nA/m. The activation level around the beam line and in the water will be negligible, while the spallation target will reach an activation level comparable to the one of a fuel element at maximum burnup...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{research}} {{examines the}} concrete {{used as a}} fast neutron radiation shield. Polymer which has high hydrogen atom content {{is added to the}} concrete material composition and planed to be capable in protecting neutron radiation. There are eleven types of mixtures i. e. : normal <b>concrete,</b> <b>baryte</b> <b>concrete,</b> serpentin concrete, mixture serpentin concrete, mangaan concrete, steel slag polymer concrete of 0...|$|R
40|$|To {{address the}} limited {{availability}} of radiation shielding data for brachytherapy {{as well as}} some disparity in existing data, Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate radiation transmission data for 60 Co, 137 Cs, 198 Au, 192 Ir, 169 Yb, 170 Tm, 131 Cs, 125 I, and 103 Pd photons through concrete, stainless steel, lead, as well as lead glass and <b>baryte</b> <b>concrete.</b> Results accounting for the oblique incidenc...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} and mechanical properties of heavyweight concretes, {{have been prepared}} in 15 different types including ordinary, <b>barytes</b> included <b>concrete</b> and mixture of them in different rate, has been investigated. This would lead to find ideal w/c ratio and cement dosage in concrete. The concretes has also been investigated against Î³-radiation both in theoretically and experimentally...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, we report the {{luminescence}} {{data obtained from}} heavy, <b>barytes</b> loaded, <b>concrete</b> containing many crystalline inclusions, extracted from a shielding block located at CERN. The use of both Thermoluminescence (TL) and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) signals, resulting from a specific trap at about 200 degrees C, is investigated for retrospective dosimetry purposes. By applying thermal cleaning experiments the TL signal of interest was isolated. Basic TL and OSL properties as thermal and optical stability, repeatability and mainly the linearity of the TL and OSL signals {{as a function of}} beta dose were investigated. The implications of all these luminescence properties to retrospective dosimetry are also briefly discussed. Publisher's Versio...|$|R
