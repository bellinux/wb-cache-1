40|$|Background: Association of extragonadal {{germ cell}} tumors EGCT with {{haematological}} malignancies is rare {{with a very}} limited prognosis. Methods and findings: We report {{a case of a}} man, 21 years old, with progressive dyspnea, chest pain, night sweats, generalized edema, hemoptysis, pancytopenia and increased serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), <b>beta-fraction</b> of the hormone chorionic gonodotrophin (beta-HCG) and lactic dehydrogenase. Chest computed tomography described a mediastinum mass measuring 11. 3 x 7. 3 cm whose biopsy revealed malignant germ cell neoplasia expressing positivity for cytokeratin, CD 30 and AFP, indicating an embryonal carcinoma with teratoma. Bone marrow biopsy revealed interstitial infiltration by malignant neoplastic cells positive for CD 68, CD 163 and lysozyme, allowing the diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma. The patient had a poor evolution, with death, sixteen days after admission. Conclusion: Histiocytic proliferations are very rare and rapidly fatal. Etiopathogenic theories for the simultaneity of these malignancies have been described based on processes of transformation from a same cellular precursor...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the roles}} of c-erB- 2 and p 53 oncoproteins in tumor progression, we aimed to {{evaluate}} their expression in hydatidiform moles, and the possible predictive value of this immunoexpression in postmolar follow-up. Group I comprised 35 patients with progression to gestational trophoblastic tumor, and group II included 32 patients with progression to spontaneous remission. Immunohistochemical tests were performed by streptavidin-peroxidase method. c-erbB- 2 immunoexpression was evaluated according to quantitative and semiquantitative criteria; p 53 according to percentage of cells with stained nuclei. Data were analyzed by Student t-test, Mann-Whitney test, ROC curve and logistic regression analysis. c-erbB- 2 and p- 53 expressions were significantly increased in group I. Quantitative and semiquantitative analysis of c-erb- 2 showed that its expression {{may be associated with}} mole hydatidiform progression to gestational trophoblastic tumor. Taking into account cells with complete membranous delineation we proposed a cut-off value of 10. 8 %. Similarly, considering the percentage of cells presenting nuclei marked by p 53 we suggested a cut-off value of 40. 1 % for the prediction of malignant transformation of mole hydatidiform. c-erbB- 2 and p 53 immunoexpression in hydatidiform mole are usually increased with malignant transformation. in addition to <b>beta-fraction</b> of human chorionic gonadotropin, they could possibly help the establishment of a therapeutic protocol.

40|$|Abstract Background Treatment with {{prostaglandin}} inhibitors {{can reduce}} renal function and impair renal water and sodium excretion. We tested the hypotheses that {{a reduction in}} prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen treatment during fasting decreased renal water and sodium excretion by increased absorption of water and sodium via the aquaporin 2 water channels and the epithelial sodium channels. Methods The effect of ibuprofen, 600 mg thrice daily, was measured during fasting in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover study of 17 healthy humans. The subjects received a standardized diet on day 1, fasted at day 2, and received an IV infusion of 3 % NaCl on day 3. The effect variables were urinary excretions of aquaporin 2 (u-AQP 2), the <b>beta-fraction</b> of the epithelial sodium channel (u-ENaCbeta), cyclic-AMP (u-cAMP), prostaglandin E 2 (u-PGE 2). Free water clearance (CH 2 O), fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), and plasma concentrations of vasopressin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, atrial-, and brain natriuretic peptide. Results Ibuprofen decreased u-AQP 2, u-PGE 2, and FENa at {{all parts of the}} study. During the same time, ibuprofen significantly increased u-ENaCbeta. Ibuprofen did not change the response in p-AVP, u-c-AMP, urinary output, and free water clearance during any of these periods. Atrial-and brain natriuretic peptide were higher. Conclusion During inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, urinary sodium excretion decreased in parallel with an increase in sodium absorption and increase in u-ENaCbeta. U-AQP 2 decreased indicating that water transport via AQP 2 fell. The vasopressin-c-AMP-axis did not mediate this effect, but it may be a consequence of the changes in the natriuretic peptide system and/or the angiotensin-aldosterone system Trial Registration Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT 00281762 </p...|$|E
40|$|Blends of {{polypropylene}} (PP) and polyamide 6 (PA 6) with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were prepared using different processing strategies in a twin-screw micro-compounder. The effect of MWNTs on the crystallization behaviour of the PP phase and the PA 6 {{phase of the}} blend has been investigated through non-isothermal crystallization studies by differential scanning calorimetric analysis. Furthermore, {{the effect of the}} addition of the compatibilizer (PP-g-MA) and the modification of MWNTs (m-MWNTs) with a non-covalent organic modifier (Li-salt of 6 amino hexanoic acid, Li-AHA) has also been studied in context to the crystallization behaviour of the PP and PA 6 phase in the blend. The crystallization studies have indicated a significant increase in bulk crystallization temperature of the PP phase in the blend in the presence of MWNTs. Moreover, the formation of 'trans-lamellar crystalline' structure consisting of PA 6 'trans-crystalline lamellae' on MWNTs surface was facilitated in the case of blends prepared via 'protocol 2 ' as compared to the corresponding blends prepared via 'protocol 1 '. Wide angle X-ray diffraction analysis has showed the existence of a beta-polymorph of the PP phase due to incorporation of the PA 6 phase in the blend. Addition of MWNTs in the blends has facilitated further beta-crystalline structure formation of the PP phase. In the presence of m-MWNTs, a higher <b>beta-fraction</b> was observed in the PP phase as compared to the blend with pristine MWNTs. Addition of PP-g-MA has suppressed the beta-phase formation in the PP phase in the blend. X-ray bulk texture analysis revealed that incorporation of PA 6 as well as pristine/modified MWNTs has influenced the extent of orientation of the PP chains towards specific crystalline planes in various blend compositions of PP and PA 6...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of a patient with Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia (CEL) with {{mutation}} in alfa PDGFR gene exhibiting a satisfactory response to treatment with imatinib mesylate. A 25 -year-old man presented in a hematology service with a persistent cough and hemogram alterations. His blood count showed a hemoglobin level of 12. 5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 94, 030 /mm 3, eosinophils were 68 % of all cells. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed hypercellularity with marked eosinophilia (77 %) and erythroid differentiation series was hypocellular with normoblast maturation. The immunohistochemically of the bone biopsy was positive for myeloperoxidase and negative for CD 34 /CD 99, consistent with CEL. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the <b>beta-fraction</b> of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFRβ) and Philadelphia chromosome (Ph 1) were negative and the alfa PDGFR (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor) was positive and showed heterozygosis in c. 2531 T>C on 18 Exon and homozygous in C. 2562 + 1 G>A at the region of the splicing site at the 18 intron. Treatment was initiated and maintained by administering 400 mg/day imatinib mesylate. Laboratory findings returned to normal ranges, with clinical improvement and a hematological response observed after the second month of therapy. Currently, the patient’s blood count shows the white blood cell count (5, 400 total leukocytes), eosinophils (8. 6 /mm 3), hemoglobin (15. 5 g/dl), hematocrit (45. 4 %) and platelets (298, 000 /mm 3) within normal ranges. The mutation search was negative in in peripheral blood one year after the initial treatment. Our work corroborates other studies on the efficacy of imatinib mesylate in the treatment of patients with CSF PDGFR alpha positive. We emphasize the importance of molecular studies, considering its relevance for the correct staging of the disease. Since CEL is a rare disease, it is important to define its etiology and anticipate its treatment, thus minimizing the damage induced by the disease...|$|E
