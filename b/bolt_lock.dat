50|$|A dead bolt, {{deadbolt}} or {{dead lock}} is a locking mechanism distinct from a spring <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> because a deadbolt cannot {{be moved to}} the open position except by rotating the lock cylinder with the key. The more common spring <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> uses a spring to hold the bolt in place, allowing retraction by applying force to the bolt itself. A deadbolt can therefore make a door more resistant to entry without the correct key.|$|E

50|$|The company's history {{dates back}} to 1926, when William F. Banham invented the first {{automatic}} latch <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> {{after a series of}} burglaries on his wife's dress shop. He opened his own locksmith shop on Oxford Street, London, and offered £25 to anyone who could pick or break one of his patented locks.|$|E
50|$|The AR-10 is a lightweight, air-cooled, magazine-fed, gas-operated rifle {{that uses}} a piston within the bolt carrier with a rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism. The rifle has a {{conventional}} layout; it features an in-line stock, an aluminum alloy receiver and a reinforced fiberglass pistol grip, handguard, and buttstock. While mostly an original design, the AR-10 built upon previously proven concepts. From the FAL it took the hinged receiver system allowing the rifle to be opened for cleaning much like a break-action shotgun. The ejection port cover {{is similar to that}} found on the German World War II-era StG44. The <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism is similar to the M1941 Johnson rifle (itself an adaptation of the Browning-designed Remington Model 8 bolt). From the German FG 42 and M1941 Johnson machine gun came the idea of straight-line stocks to reduce muzzle climb in fully automatic fire. The AR-10's method of rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking,</b> straight-line recoil, and gas operation enhanced its inherent accuracy.|$|R
50|$|The OTs-14-4A is a {{small arms}} weapon system based on the 5.45×39mm AKS-74U carbine. It is a {{selective}} fire, air-cooled magazine-fed rifle with a gas-actuated piston operating system and a rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The rifle uses bolt action: a {{rotating}} <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> the cartridge in the chamber, closes bore, ignites the cartridge, and ejects the spent cartridge. Lugs are missing; locking is {{performed on the}} charging handle.|$|R

5000|$|It was {{designed}} to be a less expensive alternative for training with an AR-15 style rifle, as the rifle itself is much less expensive than most AR-15s, and the ammunition is often much less expensive than the [...]223 Remington/5.56×45mm NATO. The rifle features a safety and <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> that operate just like an AR-15's. The M&P15-22 can also be an alternative in jurisdictions that restrict magazine capacity for centerfire cartridges.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "ignition key" [...] {{for these}} cars was {{actually}} used {{to operate a}} <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> which, on one end, unlocked the steering column (a feature destined to return, mandated, decades later), {{and on the other}} end unblocked the ignition switch, allowing it to be operated. Starting the car was then accomplished by pressing a pushbutton on the dashboard, another feature destined to return with the advent of [...] "smart keys".|$|E
5000|$|The shotgun has a {{relatively}} small number of component parts, incorporating a simple operating principle. The main features of the mechanism are the turning block <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> system and the cartridge feeding system (cut off).|$|R
50|$|The Model 31 {{was later}} {{used as a}} basis for the Mossberg 500 and related shotguns. The Mossberg is {{simplified}} and cheaper to produce. Notable differences are the use of a two-piece <b>bolt</b> with separate <b>locking</b> piece as well as a significantly simplified barrel mounting system. Further, the <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> into a barrel extension rather than directly to the receiver.|$|R
50|$|The RK 95 TP is a select-fire, gas-operated firearm {{using the}} Kalashnikov-pattern {{operating}} {{system with a}} long stroke gas piston rod coupled to the bolt carrier as in the AK rifle. The rotating <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> into battery via two locking lugs.|$|R
5000|$|The first 1,000 rifles {{were given}} to the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP) for testing. Routine {{inspection}} before operational testing found 113 defects bad enough to warrant rejection. One of these was a poorly designed <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> that enabled the bolt to fall right out of the rifle. Another was poorly tempered component springs that were described as being as [...] "soft as copper". In 1906, the RNWMP reverted to their Model 1894 Winchesters and Lee-Metfords.|$|E
50|$|Another unique {{feature is}} the <b>bolt</b> <b>lock.</b> Since {{blowback}} guns of these calibers require heavy bolts, the inertia of dropping the gun can cause the bolt to come partially open, rendering the gun unfirable until the bolt is manually closed all the way. To prevent this, the Carbine uses a lock that locks the bolt securely closed so that a fall will not dislodge it. A slight pressure on the trigger or on the bolt handle, however, will disengage the bolt {{so that it can}} move for firing or clearing the action.|$|E
50|$|Japu Punta (possibly from Quechua hapu oven made in {{the field}} of clods of earth with dry roots which are burnt to heat {{potatoes}} in them to prepare wathiya, a traditional dish, punta peak; ridge; first, before, in front of,) or Huichcana (possibly from Quechua for a bar across a door or window, <b>bolt,</b> <b>lock,</b> blockade,) is a mountain in the Vilcanota mountain range in the Andes of Peru, about 5845 m high. It is situated in the Cusco Region, Canchis Province, Pitumarca District and in the Quispicanchi Province, Marcapata District. Japu Punta lies north of the lake Sibinacocha and northwest of Condoriquiña, Huila Aje and Yayamari.|$|E
50|$|The MR1 Storm {{has nine}} {{attachment}} points for slings to accommodate multiple carry options. It {{does not require}} tools for disassembly. When the last round fires, the <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> to the rear. A ghost ring sight, adjustable for windage and elevation, is standard.|$|R
50|$|DuBiel rifles were {{constructed}} using only patented DuBiel actions which feature a five lug <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism {{resulting in a}} 36 degree bolt rotation. The short rotation produced the fastest bolt-action rifle available at the time. The actions were produced in three lengths, both right and left hand configurations.|$|R
50|$|The pistol is {{equipped}} with a self-cocking trigger hammer type double-acting SA/DA. The design provides slide catch holding the bolt after firing the last bullet in the rearward position. Blowback action (no barrel grip with a <b>bolt,</b> <b>locking</b> the barrel reached the mass closure and force the return spring).|$|R
50|$|The Lusa marries some {{concepts}} {{from the}} HK MP5 and Uzi submachine gun without being too similar to either. The complete trigger housing is {{nearly identical to}} that of the MP5, however the other internals are greatly simplified. The bolt and carrier are one welded unit, and the action is a simple blowback, unlike the roller-delay system of the MP5. The Lusa fires from the closed bolt position in both semi- and fully automatic modes. However, the Lusa's barrel can be quickly changed without tools, like the Uzi. The Lusa uses a non reciprocating ambidextrous charging handle with no provision to lock the bolt to the rear, nor does the <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> to the rear upon an empty magazine. The rear sight is a simple diopter with screw adjustment. The body is formed from a sheet of stamped and welded steel.|$|E
50|$|Winchester {{introduced}} the shotgun in 1954 as their Model 50 Automatic Shotgun in 12 and 20 gauge. The shotgun featured an Inertia Operated <b>Bolt</b> <b>Lock</b> designed by Williams. The bolt block and cartridge sat within a large floating chamber. When {{the gun was}} fired the gas forward of the floating chamber forced the chamber to the rear approximately 1/10th of an inch in a short stroke that generated the energy necessary for the bolt block to disengage {{the rear of the}} floating chamber and operate the semi-automatic action. This was the first semi-automatic shotgun with a fixed non-recoiling barrel. In 1960 Winchester {{introduced the}}ir Model 59 Automatic Shotgun which also utilized the Williams design from the Model 50. This model featured the Winlite 'glass' barrel; it was a thin tube wrapped with micro-filament glass fibre. This model could bullied with the first ever screw-in Versalite choke tubes.|$|E
5000|$|The M1918 is a {{selective}} fire, air-cooled automatic rifle using a gas-operated long-stroke piston rod actuated by propellant gases bled through a vent in the barrel. The bolt is locked by a rising <b>bolt</b> <b>lock.</b> The gun fires {{from an open}} bolt. The spring-powered cartridge casing extractor is contained in the bolt and a fixed ejector is installed in the trigger group. The BAR is striker fired (the bolt carrier serves as the striker) and uses a trigger mechanism with a fire selector lever that enables operating in either semi-automatic or fully automatic firing modes. The selector lever {{is located on the}} left side of the receiver and is simultaneously the manual safety (selector lever in the [...] "S" [...] position - weapon is [...] "safe", [...] "F" [...] - [...] "Fire", [...] "A" [...] - [...] "Automatic" [...] fire). The [...] "safe" [...] setting blocks the trigger.|$|E
2500|$|Behind {{the bolt}} carrier is a plastic or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a return spring. The buffer spring begins to push the bolt carrier and bolt back toward the chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides the bolt cam pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The <b>bolt's</b> <b>locking</b> lugs push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by feed ramps into the chamber. As the <b>bolt's</b> <b>locking</b> lugs move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces the bolt to twist and [...] "lock" [...] into the barrel extension.|$|R
5000|$|The {{receiver}} is {{made from}} forged and machined aluminum to reduce weight. The <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> into an extension on the barrel instead of the receiver allowing for a lightweight receiver while not compromising {{the strength of the}} <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism. On a few prototype guns, an all-aluminum ("Sullaloy") barrel was fitted at the insistence of George Sullivan - ArmaLite's president - though after the 1957 Springfield Armory tests, all production AR-10s were fitted with standard steel barrels. [...] The stock {{is made from}} a phenolic composite reinforced fiberglass with a core of rigid plastic foam. The handguards and pistol grip are also fiberglass. Fairchild was an aircraft manufacturer, and the use of plastics, titanium, and aluminum were common in the aircraft industry at the time, though not generally used in firearms.|$|R
50|$|The shotgun has a {{relatively}} small number of component parts, incorporating a simple operating principle. The main features of the mechanism are the turning block <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> system and the cartridge feeding system (cut off). These serve to make the Raffaello CrioComfort reliable and practical, easy to strip and maintain.|$|R
40|$|Following STS- 107, the External Tank (ET) Project {{implemented}} {{corrective actions}} and configuration {{changes at the}} ET bipod fitting. Among the corrective actions, the existing <b>bolt</b> <b>lock</b> wire which provided resistance to potential bolt rotation was removed. The lock wire removal was because of concerns with creating voids during foam application and potential for lock wire to become debris. The bolts had been previously lubricated to facilitate assembly but, because of elimination of the lock wire, the ET Project wanted to enable the locking feature of the insert. Thus, the lubrication was removed from bolt threads and instead applied to the washer under the bolt head. Lubrication is necessary to maximize joint pre-load while remaining within the bolt torque specification. The locking feature is implemented by thread crimping in at four places in the insert. As the bolt is torqued into the insert the bolt threads its way past the crimped parts of the insert. This provides the locking of the bolt, as torque is required to loosen the joint after clamping...|$|E
25|$|The rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} two steel locking lugs that engage locking recesses in the breech, and is identical to that used in the SG 540. A spring-loaded extractor is incorporated into the bolt while a fixed protrusion {{on one of the}} receiver's internal guide rails ejects the spent cartridge casings.|$|R
50|$|It has a picatinny railing on the {{receiver}} to allow the installations of weapon sights like reflex sights with iron sights built into the railing. The weapon fires in a gas operated mode, utilizing rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> and a gas piston. The MSMC can also be suppressed with the installation of a silencer.|$|R

30|$|Nail failure {{has been}} {{reported}} by Gonschorek et al. and Wolinsky et al. [17, 37], {{but the majority of}} studies report failures of the <b>locking</b> <b>bolts.</b> Twenty-eight distal <b>locking</b> <b>bolt</b> breakages were experienced, the majority of them during {{the first part of the}} study [45]. This led to discontinuation of the use of cannulated <b>locking</b> <b>bolts</b> and a policy to insert both bolts in all static nailing procedures. In addition, in severely comminuted fractures and overweight patients, the weight bearing protocol was altered.|$|R
50|$|Long recoil {{operation}} is found primarily in shotguns, particularly ones based on John Browning's Auto-5 action. In a long recoil action the barrel and <b>bolt</b> remain <b>locked</b> together during recoil, compressing the recoil springs. Following this rearward movement, the <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> {{to the rear}} and the barrel is forced forward by its spring. The bolt is held in position until the barrel returns completely forward during which time the spent cartridge has been extracted and ejected, and a new shell has been positioned from the magazine. The bolt is released and forced closed by its recoil spring, chambering a fresh round.|$|R
