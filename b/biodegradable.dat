5|$|Internationally, food waste's {{effect on}} the {{environment}} has been an issue. Ireland is facing fines of millions of euros if the amount of <b>biodegradable</b> waste it sends to landfill does not fall below the maximum quantity set by the European Union's Landfill Directive. By 2010, the same directive will impose fines of £40m a year across England, rising to £205m by 2013, if its own targets on <b>biodegradable</b> municipal waste are not met; the amount of <b>biodegradable</b> municipal waste being sent to landfill in 2010 must be 75% of that sent in 1995, by 2013 it must be 50% and by 2020 it must be 35%.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} {{biological}} significance, amino acids {{are important in}} nutrition and are commonly used in nutritional supplements, fertilizers, and food technology. Industrial uses include the production of drugs, <b>biodegradable</b> plastics, and chiral catalysts.|$|E
5|$|Biodiesel (in its pure form) is a non-toxic, <b>biodegradable</b> form {{of diesel}} fuel made from {{vegetable}} oil, usually soybean oil or recycled restaurant grease. Biodiesel promises {{a reduction in}} some exhaust emissions, as well as reduced dependence on foreign petroleum supplies.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are under}} {{development}} as {{components of a}} range of <b>biodegradable</b> polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble <b>biodegradable</b> polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor. In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as bisphenol A in the manufacture of polycarbonates.|$|E
5|$|As a {{publicity}} stunt {{for the opening of}} The Simpsons Movie on 16 July 2007, a giant Homer Simpson brandishing a doughnut was outlined in water-based <b>biodegradable</b> paint {{to the left of the}} Cerne Abbas giant. This act displeased local neopagans, who pledged to perform rain magic to wash the figure away.|$|E
5|$|The Incredible Hulk joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut carbon {{emissions}} and waste created during filming. Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, {{was a popular}} environmental analogy, and Norton himself was an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced yellow pine instead of lauan for the sets, and also used zero-or low-VOC paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, <b>biodegradable</b> food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, <b>biodegradable</b> soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries. The Incredible Hulk became the first blockbuster film to receive the Environmental Media Association's Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.|$|E
5|$|Youngblood was a {{division}} president of Dave Liles Ethanol Fuels, which produces a fuel additive that purports to boost octane, clean fuel systems, {{and help the}} environment by reducing engine emissions and being completely <b>biodegradable.</b> He also owns and maintains a farm in his native North Florida, in which he currently raises pine trees and where he raised cattle until 2002.|$|E
5|$|Figures from WRAP {{revealed}} {{the most efficient}} method of collecting food waste to be separate collections, followed by mixed green and food waste on a weekly basis. A mixed fortnightly collection was shown {{to be the worst}} performing. This was considered confirmation of earlier suspicions that, if carried out correctly, separate collections can result in less wastage of <b>biodegradable</b> waste. A widespread pilot scheme for separate food waste collection, involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a mesophilic anaerobic digestion facility was awarded, including the construction of buildings and various other pieces of equipment required for the treatment of sludge. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion enables the breaking down of <b>biodegradable</b> materials using micro-organisms under moderate temperatures. The new sludge treatment facility enables the recycled sludge to be used on neighbouring farmlands as manure, and also enables Yorkshire Water to generate 1.9MW of renewable energy using combined heat and power units.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that given its proportion of the waste stream and the lack of distinct collections, food waste is not currently being targeted appropriately. However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food and garden waste, have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting <b>biodegradable</b> waste from other materials.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to anthropogenic disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not <b>biodegradable,</b> and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} an {{underground}} sewage system, covering about 40% {{of the town}} area, that collects domestic waste and conveys it to septic tanks for disposal. Solid waste is disposed of in a nearby dumping ground, which also houses the town's crematorium. Doorstep collection of garbage and segregation of <b>biodegradable</b> and non-biodegradable waste have been implemented since 2003. Vermicomposting of vegetable waste is carried out {{with the help of}} non-governmental organisations. In June 2009, in order to reduce waste, the municipality proposed a ban on plastic carrier bags and sachets in the town.|$|E
5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce <b>biodegradable</b> waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E
5|$|Shulgin's {{professional}} activities {{continued to}} lean {{in the direction}} of psychopharmacology, furthered by his personal experiences with psychedelics. But during this period he was unable to do much independent research. His opportunity for further research came in 1961 after his development of Zectran, the first <b>biodegradable</b> pesticide, a highly profitable product. In his book PIHKAL, Shulgin limits his pesticide days at Dow Chemical to one sentence in 978 pages. Dow Chemical Company, in return for Zectran's valuable patent, gave Shulgin great freedom. During this time, he created and patented drugs when Dow asked, and published findings on other drugs in journals such as Nature and the Journal of Organic Chemistry. Eventually, Dow Chemical requested that he no longer use their name on his publications.|$|E
25|$|Food {{packaging}} {{should no}} longer contain any organic matter (organic matter, if any, needs {{to be placed in}} a <b>biodegradable</b> waste bin or be buried in a garden). Since no trace of <b>biodegradable</b> material is best kept in the packaging before placing it in a trash bag, some packaging also needs to be rinsed.|$|E
25|$|The college runs a {{composting}} {{system to}} handle {{the majority of its}} <b>biodegradable</b> waste.|$|E
25|$|Methanol {{is readily}} <b>biodegradable</b> in both aerobic (oxygen present) and {{anaerobic}} (oxygen absent) environments. Methanol will not {{persist in the}} environment. The half-life for methanol in groundwater is just one to seven days, while many common gasoline components have half-lives {{in the hundreds of}} days (such as benzene at 10–730 days). Since methanol is miscible with water and <b>biodegradable,</b> it is unlikely to accumulate in groundwater, surface water, air or soil.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} have {{genetically engineered bacteria}} to synthesize completely <b>biodegradable</b> plastics, such as Biopol; however, these are expensive at present.|$|E
25|$|Methanogenic consortia degrade styrene, {{using it}} as a carbon source. Pseudomonas putida can convert styrene oil into various <b>biodegradable</b> polyhydroxyalkanoates.|$|E
25|$|Biopolymers are <b>biodegradable,</b> {{and some}} are also compostable. Some biopolymers are biodegradable: they are broken down into CO2 and water by microorganisms. Some of these <b>biodegradable</b> biopolymers are compostable: they can be put into an {{industrial}} composting process and will break down by 90% within six months. Biopolymers that do this can be marked with a 'compostable' symbol, under European Standard EN 13432 (2000). Packaging marked with this symbol can be put into industrial composting processes and will break down within six months or less. An example of a compostable polymer is PLA film under 20μm thick: films which are thicker than that do not qualify as compostable, {{even though they are}} <b>biodegradable.</b> In Europe there is a home composting standard and associated logo that enables consumers to identify and dispose of packaging in their compost heap.|$|E
25|$|By {{processing}} the <b>biodegradable</b> waste either by anaerobic digestion or by composting MBT technologies help {{to reduce the}} contribution of greenhouse gases to global warming.|$|E
25|$|Pseudomonas putida {{is capable}} of {{converting}} styrene oil into the <b>biodegradable</b> plastic PHA. This may someday be of use in the effective disposing of polystyrene foam.|$|E
25|$|The process {{involves}} a biological/chemical method for converting any <b>biodegradable</b> material (e.g., urban wastes, such as municipal solid waste, <b>biodegradable</b> waste, and sewage sludge, agricultural residues such as corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, cotton gin trash, manure) into useful chemicals, such as carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid), ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone) and biofuels, {{such as a}} mixture of primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, n-butanol) and/or a mixture of secondary alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, 2-butanol, 3-pentanol). Because of the many products that can be economically produced, this process is a true biorefinery.|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} harnesses anaerobic microorganisms {{to break}} down the <b>biodegradable</b> component of the waste to produce biogas and soil improver. The biogas can be used to generate electricity and heat.|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is {{a collection}} of processes by which microorganisms break down <b>biodegradable</b> material in the absence of oxygen. The methanogenic archaea populations play an indispensable role in anaerobic wastewater treatments.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Shulgin, chemist and {{pharmacologist}} {{credited with}} introducing the drug MDMA ("ecstasy") to psychologists {{in the late}} 1970s; worked for Dow in the 1960s, where he invented Zectran, the first <b>biodegradable</b> insecticide.|$|E
25|$|Biotechnology has {{applications}} in four major industrial areas, including health care (medical), crop production and agriculture, non food (industrial) uses of crops {{and other products}} (e.g. <b>biodegradable</b> plastics, vegetable oil, biofuels), and environmental uses.|$|E
25|$|Maine {{companies}} are exploring {{the possibilities of}} using waste potatoes to obtain polylactic acid for use in plastic products; other research projects seek ways to use the starch {{as a base for}} <b>biodegradable</b> packaging.|$|E
25|$|Whereas sling-bullets {{are common}} finds in the archaeological record, slings {{themselves}} are rare. This is both because a sling's materials are <b>biodegradable</b> and because slings were lower-status weapons, rarely preserved in a wealthy person’s grave.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel is also safe {{to handle}} and {{transport}} {{because it is}} non-toxic and <b>biodegradable,</b> and has a high flash point of about 300°F (148°C) compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which has a flash point of 125°F (52°C).|$|E
25|$|Such {{considerations}} {{are the main}} reason why several countries administrate incineration of <b>biodegradable</b> waste as renewable energy. The rest – mainly plastics and other oil and gas derived products – is generally treated as non-renewables.|$|E
25|$|The terms {{mechanical}} {{biological treatment}} or mechanical biological pre-treatment relate {{to a group of}} solid waste treatment systems. These systems enable the recovery of materials contained within the mixed waste and facilitate the stabilisation of the <b>biodegradable</b> component of the material.|$|E
25|$|Some {{companies}} produce <b>biodegradable</b> additives, {{to enhance}} biodegradation. Plastic can have starch powder added as a filler {{to allow it}} to degrade more easily, but this still does not lead to the complete breaking down of the plastic.|$|E
25|$|Other classifications {{are based}} on qualities that are {{relevant}} for manufacturing or product design. Examples of such qualities and classes are: thermoplastics and thermosets, conductive polymers, <b>biodegradable</b> plastics and engineering plastics and other plastics with particular structures, such as elastomers.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{plastics}} {{on global warming}} is mixed. Plastics are generally made from petroleum. If the plastic is incinerated, it increases carbon emissions; if it is placed in a landfill, it becomes a carbon sink although <b>biodegradable</b> plastics have caused methane emissions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biodegradable</b> {{plastics}} are plastics that degrade, {{or break}} down, upon exposure to: sunlight or ultra-violet radiation, water or dampness, bacteria, enzymes or wind abrasion. In some instances, rodent, pest, or insect attack {{can also be}} considered as forms of biodegradation or environmental degradation.|$|E
