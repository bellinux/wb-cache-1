The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer service brake hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|R

In tractors that are not equipped with a trailer hand valve, only the merged outputs of the foot-valve (i.e., via a single two-way check valve) are directed towards the trailer relay valve; however, {{the fact that the}} foot-valve's delivery-port outputs are still merged enables the trailer's service brakes to still be controlled even if there is failure within one <b>braking</b> <b>circuit</b> of the tractor.|$|E

50|$|The Kadett B was {{the first}} Kadett to offer disc brakes on the front wheels. 238 mm {{diameter}} disc brakes at the front came included as standard fittings on all but the cheapest versions, complemented by 200 mm diameter drum brakes at the back. The brakes were controlled hydraulically. From February 1967 the single hydraulic <b>braking</b> <b>circuit</b> {{was replaced by a}} dual circuit braking system: this built in reserve of redundancy in the braking control system reflected a growing interest in primary and secondary safety which was becoming a feature of German auto-design in the 1960s. Whether as an option on the base model or as a standard feature across the rest of the range, where disc brakes were fitted Opel also included servo-assistance in the braking system from February 1967.|$|E
5000|$|However, on {{units with}} Triple Valves (Distributore tipo Westinghouse) and 7-position levers, <b>braking</b> <b>circuit</b> is {{slightly}} different. The [...] is divided {{in two parts}} like said before, but there isn't the command reservoir tank: when the pressure inside the brake pipe drops, it's directly the auxiliary reservoir that makes the frame put in the middle moving. Braking is not gradual on release in this case: when the driver puts the controller on [...] "release" [...] position, brakes are fully released; if he brakes again too shortly after, there is the risk to have a loss of braking power because {{there may not be}} enough air to brake optimally, since the absence of the fixed pressure of the command reservoir doesn't ensure that there is enough air to safely release the brakes. It is even possible to fully exhaust the reservoir, with the consequent danger to not be able to stop the train at all. This is prevented in units with Breda and other types of valves as the brakes cannot be fully released if there is not enough air in main reservoir tanks to brake again.|$|E
50|$|In trailers, {{this remote}} air-supply {{is in the}} form of a tank, which is charged {{whenever}} the emergency brakes are released via the red trailer-supply valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, this tank actually receives its air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs of the tractor; the air from both of these reservoirs is merged via a two-way check valve. The two-way check valve is a pneumatic device that has two inputs and one output; each input is connected to one these reservoirs. Only the air that is at the higher pressure is allowed to pass through to the check valve's output, which then passes through the tractor-protection valve, and then travels onward towards the trailer's air-tank and spring brake valve via the red trailer-supply line (a.k.a., the emergency line); this releases the trailer's emergency brakes (a.k.a. spring brakes). The tractor-protection valve is a device that prevents air from being lost from the tractor's braking system in the event of the air-lines becoming separated or broken. The tractor's air-lines connect to the trailer's air-lines via metal connectors known as gladhands. The merged air from both reservoirs of the tractor prevents air-loss from only one tractor <b>braking</b> <b>circuit</b> from causing the trailer's spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location, such as in the middle of an intersection.|$|E
50|$|There {{were also}} 15 inch wheels as against the 16 inch size found on {{previous}} Bristols, and the disc braking system {{dating back to}} the 406 was revised {{for the first time since}} then, with a greatly updated system of <b>braking</b> <b>circuits</b> being introduced.|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} of a negative scrub radius is that the geometry naturally compensates for split µ (mu) braking, or failure {{in one of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>circuits.</b> It also provides center point steering {{in the event of a}} tire deflation, which provides greater stability and steering control in this emergency.|$|R
50|$|Also {{inherited}} from the previous model was the combination of disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear, but now with twin <b>braking</b> <b>circuits</b> as an additional safety feature, and servo-assistance. The 26M received enlarged front brake discs to complement its power-assisted steering, twin halogen headlights, and twin exhaust pipes.|$|R
50|$|A {{spring brake}} relay valve {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as the service brake relay valve, although it has the opposite effect. This type of relay valve responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each spring brake chamber under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the spring brakes much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, {{as well as the}} supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the spring brakes to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one <b>braking</b> <b>circuit</b> from causing the spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility {{on the part of the}} driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the spring brakes must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front service brakes may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergency—especially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the spring brakes in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front service brakes to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption.QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and service brakes will function 1 second between each other.The relay valve's function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits.|$|E
40|$|Humans inhale {{hundreds}} of Aspergillus conidia without adverse consequences. Powerful protective mechanisms may ensure prompt {{control of the}} pathogen and inflammation. Here we reveal a previously unknown mechanism by which the danger molecule S 100 B integrates pathogen – and danger–sensing pathways to restrain inflammation. Upon forming complexes with TLR 2 ligands, S 100 B inhibited TLR 2 via RAGE, through a paracrine epithelial cells/neutrophil circuit that restrained pathogen-induced inflammation. However, upon binding to nucleic acids, S 100 B activated intracellular TLRs eventually resolve danger-induced inflammation via transcriptional inhibition of S 100 B. Thus, the spatiotemporal regulation of TLRs and RAGE by S 100 B provides evidence for an evolving <b>braking</b> <b>circuit</b> in infection whereby an endogenous danger protect...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Vehicle {{technology}} has increased rapidly in recent years, particularly {{in relation to}} braking system and sensing system. In parallel {{to the development of}} braking technologies, sensors have been developed that are capable of detecting physical obstacles, other vehicles or pedestrians around the vehicle. This development prevents accidents of vehicles using Stereo Multi-Purpose cameras, Automated Emergency Braking Systems and Ultrasonic Sensors. The stereo multi-purpose camera provides spatial intelligence of up to 50 metres in front of the vehicle and there is an environment recognition of 500 metres. Cars can automatically brake due to obstacles or any hindrance when the sensor senses the obstacles. The <b>braking</b> <b>circuit</b> function is to brake the car automatically after receiving signal from the sensors. All cars are competent in applying brakes automatically to a maximum extent of deceleration of 0. 4 g. Integrated safety systems are based on three principles.

40|$|Abstract‘Turbo Braking Assists’ (TBA) {{employs the}} {{principles}} of turbo machinery and automotive engineering {{in order to achieve}} effective braking assistance for the modern day disc as well as drum brakes. These brakes are intended for the purpose of braking assists during high speed motion. The major components include a turbine or rotor, pump, nozzle, enlarged brake fluid chamber, DOT 5. 1 braking fluid. The functioning involves directing a jet of high velocity brake fluid (DOT 5. 1 in this case) at the blades of the rotor which is coupled with the wheel. The <b>braking</b> <b>circuit</b> is used as such with the enlargement of the brake fluid chamber. A pump is added to the set up to enable increase of mass flow rate of fluid and also to ensure the continuity of fluid flow in the entire circuit. A speed sensor is integrated along with the circuit to activate the pump such that the braking assists are put to use only after a particular velocity is reached as braking assists are not necessary at lower speed...|$|E

50|$|In 1988, BMW {{introduced}} an electronic/hydraulic ABS for motorcycles, {{ten years after}} Daimler Benz and Bosch released the first four-wheel vehicle ABS for series production.

50|$|The system {{employs a}} travel sensor and a {{pressure}} sensor at the pedal {{to measure the}} speed and force of the driver's command.

50|$|In September 1967 servo-assistance for {{the brakes}} became an option, {{the brakes on}} all but the basic model now being {{controlled}} using twin <b>braking</b> <b>circuits,</b> and by (in Germany) the final months of 1968 the range had settled down to three models, with the entry level Audi 60 powered by a 55 PS motor, the less basic Audi 75 producing 75 PS and the Audi Super 90 with 90 PS, able to challenge the performance image {{of some of the}} smaller BMWs.|$|R
5000|$|Interference {{is known}} as 'pulsating brakes' which may occur when braking while also having the turn {{indicator}} flashing.

Be aware that if you do a completely separate wiring the brake ground must be separated from the lighting ground. That includes the breakaway protection circuits and battery. (Think of what Kirchhoff's circuit laws says).|$|R
5000|$|A {{reservoir}} above each {{master cylinder}} supplies the master cylinder with enough brake fluid to avoid air {{from entering the}} master cylinder (even the typical clutch uses brake fluid, {{but it may also}} be referred to as [...] "clutch fluid" [...] in a clutch applr). Each piston in a master cylinder operates a <b>brake</b> <b>circuit,</b> and for modern light trucks and passenger cars, usually a <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> leads to a brake caliper or shoe on only two of the vehicle's wheels, and the other <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> provides brake-pressure to slow down and stop the other two wheels. This is done in a diagonally split hydraulic system. If there is a hydraulic failure in the brake lines served by the master cylinder's secondary piston both pistons will move forward when the brakes are applied, but there is nothing to resist piston travel except the secondary piston spring. This lets the primary piston build up only a small amount of pressure until the secondary piston bottoms in the cylinder bore. Then the primary piston will build enough hydraulic pressure to operate the brakes served by this half of the system. In case of a hydraulic failure in the brake system served by the primary piston, the primary piston will move forward when the brakes are applied but will not build up hydraulic pressure. In this case very little force is transferred to the secondary piston through the primary piston spring until the piston extension screw comes in contact with the secondary piston. Then, pushrod force is transmitted directly to the secondary piston and enough pressure is built up to operate its brakes. Usually the 2 systems are split into left front and right rear comprising one system and right front and left rear comprising the other system. For safety, this is done so that usually only two wheels lose their braking ability {{at the same time and}} that both sides of the car have at least one braking system working and both ends of the car have at least one system working. With only 1 system working there is longer stopping distances and repairs should be done before driving again.|$|R
