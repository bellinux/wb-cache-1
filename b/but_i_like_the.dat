500|$|To {{complete}} the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and vocalist Joe Duplantier of Gojira. Rizzo was his choice because, according to Max, he and Rizzo [...] "play together in Soulfly and musically {{we are like}} twin brothers". Max {{also said that he}} talked to Rizzo about going back to the roots of the mid-1980s thrash metal, which he did with Sepultura. Max continues, [...] "Marc was completely into it and he did great. He surpassed what I asked him to do." [...] Max stated that Duplantier was Gloria's idea, as he did not know him at all. He added, [...] "We had no idea who the guy is, he's from a different continent and we don't speak French. I did know the Gojira CD. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> element of surprise and danger Joe brought." ...|$|E
500|$|Mucho Macho Man first raced at Calder Race Course. [...] He was {{scratched}} by {{the track}} veterinarian {{from the first}} race into which he was entered; he had been slightly injured when the horse next to him reared and flipped over in the starting gate. He was entered in another race a week later, a maiden race in which he finished second, losing to a colt named Gourmet Dinner. After that race, Mucho Macho Man was purchased by Reeves Thoroughbred Racing. [...] Dean and Patti Reeves had considered purchasing Gourmet Dinner, but Dean Reeves recalled saying at the time, [...] "Call me crazy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> second horse." [...] After the sale, Tim Ritvo took over the training of Mucho Macho Man from his original trainer, Bill White. The colt came in third at his next race, at Saratoga in New York state; {{he won his first}} race on September19, 2010, at Monmouth Park in New Jersey. After that race, the colt's training was turned over to Kathy Ritvo when Tim began working for Gulfstream Park. In November 2010, Mucho Macho Man moved up to graded class and finished second behind To Honor and Serve twice in a row at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York City, first in the Nashua Stakes and then in the Remsen Stakes. Throughout his two-year-old year the young horse was easily distracted, so he raced with blinkers for both White and Ritvo.|$|E
2500|$|Larry explained, [...] "I'm a chopper builder. Old-time, old-school chopper builder. [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> modern {{technology}} that's involved. [...] So the bikes run better, perform better. [...] And {{we have more}} fun with them." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "A lot of {{the boys}} resented me. They called me a tomboy. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> competition. <b>I</b> was good, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wanted {{something}} darker,' said Somers airily. 'There {{are so many}} fair models among native Englishwomen. Still, blondes are useful property!... Well, well; this is flippancy. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> look of her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did, sir. Perhaps I am to blame; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> young fellow's looks. He was {{clean-cut}} and frank, {{and believed}} in his pump. I did more. At {{the climax of}} the struggle I gave another thousand, making five thousand in all." ...|$|R
2500|$|The artist {{does not}} {{prefer to be}} tagged as a photographer, {{sculptor}} or video-artist. He explains: “I trained as a traditional painter, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> freedom to use any kind of medium. I don’t like hard divides.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Freeman has {{described}} how {{she has been}} influenced by early experiences with racism and also by her Bahá'í Faith. Freeman was raised a Baha'i, and says of her faith, [...] "I'm not a devout Baha'i <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> prayers and I appreciate their values about the equality of all human kind".|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Brooklyn-based company Wheelhouse Pickles marketed a {{pepper sauce}} named [...] "Minor Threat Sauce". Requesting {{only that the}} {{original}} label design (which {{was based on the}} [...] "Bottled Violence" [...] artwork) be amended, Ian MacKaye gave the product his endorsement. A small mention of this was made in music magazine Revolver, where MacKaye commented [...] "I don't really like hot sauce <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Minor Threat stuff".|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Nick," [...] said he, [...] "it isn't so bad as that. Your father's for his Majesty, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> rest of us. He's merely {{gone over}} to fight for him." [...] And {{he looked at the}} lady and laughed again. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> boy.|$|R
5000|$|ACE gave it {{an overall}} review score of 695/1000, calling it {{certainly}} one of the better GAC games released by Incentive." [...] Mike Gerrard of Your Sinclair wrote that [...] "as apart from a few careless screen layouts {{this is one of the}} best GAC games I've yet seen. The speech function is often limited to saying 'Hello' just to get a response from <b>the</b> characters, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> way the authors seem to have successfully packed lots of features into the program. Highly recommended." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{offered me}} a card, with [...] "Professor Westervelt" [...] {{engraved}} on it. At the same time, as if to vindicate his claim to the professorial dignity, so often assumed on very questionable grounds, {{he put on a}} pair of spectacles, which so altered the character of his face that I hardly knew him again. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> present aspect no better than the former one.|$|R
60|$|Dearest Mrs. Martin, {{mind you}} tell me the truth exactly. I should like much to have pleased you and Mr. Martin, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> truth best of all from you....|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{it comes}} right in between Lane's farm and Puddock's. They've always {{let me have}} the {{shooting}} as a compliment. Not that there's ever anything in it. It's only seven acres. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> civility." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A loggers' trail. It's partly {{grown up}} and broke off {{altogether}} when I got near the rocks. After that I had a rough scramble, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> woods and try to walk {{as much as possible}} in my holidays." ...|$|E

5000|$|When Fazzini had roused {{his men to}} raid {{the secret}} Communist base, Moran remarks: [...] "His force of Fascisti paraded in the square. It took some time {{to get them out}} to parade - they must have all been in bed - <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> look of them. They were a fine, {{straight}} body of young men, dressed in field-green breeches and black shirts and each armed with a sort of truncheon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] my {{guardian}} assented; [...] "don't {{have too}} much to do with him. Keep as clear of him as you can. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> fellow, Pip; {{he is one of the}} true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to go}} home, aunt. Don't look so startled, please. I {{heard from}} papa this morning, and he's not very well, and Lord Thurwell comes back to-morrow, so you won't be lonely, and I've really quite made my mind up. Town is very nice, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> country best." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care {{either for}} the {{formality}} or the ceremony, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> amusement and the gaiety, and should ask {{with much more}} reason how can you like to spend your time studying parchments and reading the doings of those old Romans, when you might be enjoying yourself here. The matter is altogether beyond me." ...|$|E

5000|$|David Shannon {{was born}} in Washington, D.C., but he also spent his {{childhood}} in Spokane, Washington. In an interview with Sonia Bolle in the Childrens Literature Review (CLR), he said, [...] "I loved Oliver Twist," [...] <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> Artful Dodger more than Oliver. And I always thought the villains in Disney Movies were really cool." [...] Shannon said that this fondness for villains made him realize as a child that [...] "you need both sides for a good story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Maggie, {{reviving}} {{a little}} in the desire to vindicate the variety of her reading. [...] "I know the reading in this book isn't pretty; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> pictures, and I make stories to the pictures out of my own head, you know. But I've got 'Æsop's Fables,' and a book about Kangaroos and things, and the 'Pilgrim's Progress.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't compare them, {{nor will}} I argue; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Duke. Nay;--I love him. During {{the last two}} years I have allowed the whole fashion of my life to be remodelled by this intimacy. You knew what were my habits. I have only been in Vienna for one week since I last saw you, and I have spent months and months at Matching." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am dipping my pen {{into the}} old silver {{inkstand}} {{which used to be}} in the front drawing-room. Every morning at about 5 A.M. I have a cup of tea or coffee, and use Grandmamma Coleridge's old-fashioned silver cream-jug, and the cup and saucer which Augusta sent out years ago, my old christening spoon, and the old silver tea-pot and salver. Very grand, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> old things.|$|E
60|$|I {{had many}} beloved haunts at <b>the</b> Grange, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> garret best. It was a roomy old place, {{big enough to}} have comfortably housed a family in itself, and was filled with cast-off {{furniture}} and old trunks and boxes of discarded finery. I was never tired of playing there, dressing up in the old-fashioned gowns and hats and practising old-time dance steps before the high, cracked mirror that hung at one end. That old garret was a veritable fairyland to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "A wife... A {{kindness}} to her. Ah, yes; a kindness to her {{to release}} her altogether... <b>But</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> sound of it. I can forgive, Sue." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. I was {{on guard}} {{one day when}} the Queen gave one of her tea-parties to the blind. Awful affair. But the {{children}} are awfully nice children. Prince of Wales awfully nice, almost too nice. Prince Henry smart boy, too--oh, a smart boy. Queen Mary poured the tea, and I handed round bread and butter. She told me I made a very good waiter. I said, Thank you, Madam. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> children. Very different from the Battenbergs. Oh!--" [...] he wrinkled his nose. [...] "I can't stand the Battenbergs." ...|$|E
60|$|I have {{to thank}} you and Moxon for a {{delightful}} volume, your last (I hope not) of 'Elia.' I have read it all except some of the 'Popular Fallacies,' which I reserve.... The book has much pleased the whole of my family, viz. my wife, daughter, Miss Hutchinson, and my poor dear sister, on her sick bed; they all return their best thanks. I am not sure <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> 'Old China,' and the 'Wedding,' {{as well as any}} of the Essays. I read 'Love me and my Dog' to my poor sister this morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Honey you {{can have}} for asking, for I've plenty of it already in my cabin, though it's {{somewhat}} 'arly in the season to begin to break in upon the store. In general, the bee-hunters keep back till August, for they think it better to commence work when the creatures"--this word Ben pronounced as accurately as if brought up at St. James's, making it neither [...] "creatur'" [...] nor [...] "creatOOre"--"to commence work when the creatures {{have had time to}} fill up, after winter's feed. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> old stock, and, what is more, I feel satisfied this is not to be a common summer, and so I thought I would make an early start." ...|$|E
5000|$|Alyse Wax from Fearnet {{also gives}} a good review {{saying that it}} was a very enjoyable episode. [...] "First off, Damon going Dr. Mengele on Wes was a scene of epic beauty. It was swift, it was violent, it was slick. I would not have minded seeing a little more of Damon’s “playtime” with Wes. Katherine going to hell was an obvious choice, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> way they did it. The comedy of her {{slapping}} Bonnie’s shoulders, trying to get it to work, then just getting swallowed up by darkness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't {{the prison}} {{impressed}} me. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> things you said here. I felt suddenly I understood you--as an intelligent person. If you'll forgive my saying that, and implying what goes with it. There's something--puppyish in a man's usual attitude to women. That is what I've had on my conscience.... I don't think we're altogether to blame if we don't {{take some of}} your lot seriously. Some of your sex, <b>I</b> mean. <b>But</b> we smirk a little, I'm afraid, habitually when we talk to you. We smirk, and we're a bit--furtive." ...|$|R
