The whole collections have, with great management, amounted to about twelve lacs of rupees, from which sum he has to support his troops, his family, and several relations and dependants of the late Rohilla chiefs. He says, it clearly appears to be intended to deprive him of his country, as the high demand you have made of him is inadmissible. Should he have assented to it, {{it would be impossible}} to perform the conditions, and then his reputation would be injured by a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement.</b> Allif Khân further represents, that it is his master's intention, in case the demand should not be relinquished by you, first to proceed to Lucknow, where he proposes having an interview with the Vizier and the Resident; if he should not be able to obtain his own terms for a future possession of his jaghire, he will set off for Calcutta in order to pray for justice from the Honorable the Governor-General. He observes, it is the custom of the Honorable Company, when they deprive a chief of his country, to grant him some allowance. This he expects from Mr. Hastings's bounty; but if he should be disappointed, he will certainly set off upon a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, and renounce the cares of the world.--He directs his vakeel to ascertain whether the English intend to deprive him of his country; for if they do, he is ready to surrender it, upon receiving an order from the Resident." ...|$|E

5000|$|The English {{common law}} of {{restraint}} of trade is the direct predecessor to modern competition law later {{developed in the}} US. It {{is based on the}} prohibition of agreements that ran counter to public policy, unless the reasonableness of an agreement could be shown. It effectively prohibited agreements designed to restrain another's trade. The 1414 Dyer's is the first known restrictive trade agreement to be examined under English common law. A dyer had given a bond not to exercise his trade in the same town as the plaintiff for six months but the plaintiff had promised nothing in return. On hearing the plaintiff's attempt to enforce this restraint, Hull J exclaimed, [...] "per Dieu, if the plaintiff were here, he should go to prison until he had paid a fine to the King." [...] The court denied the collection of a bond for the dyer's <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> because the agreement was held to be a restriction on trade. English courts subsequently decided a range of cases which gradually developed competition related case law, which eventually were transformed into statute law.|$|E
50|$|The Rajput ruler Rana Sanga {{had sent}} an {{ambassador}} to Babur at Kabul, offering {{to join in}} Babur's attack on Sultan Ibrahim Lodi of Delhi. Sanga had offered to attack Agra while Babur would be attacking Delhi. However, while Babur did attack Sultan Ibrahim Lodi, and took over Delhi and Agra, Sanga made no move, apparently having changed his mind. Babur had resented this backsliding; in his autobiography, Babur accuses Rana Sanga of <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement.</b> The historian Satish Chandra speculates that Sanga may have imagined a long drawn struggle taking place between Babur and Sultan Ibrahim Lodi following which {{he would be able}} to take control over the regions he coveted. Alternatively, writes Chandra, Sanga may have thought that in the event of a Mughal victory, Babur would withdraw from Delhi and Agra, like Timur, once he had seized the treasures of these cities. Once he realized that Babur intended to stay on in India, Sanga proceeded to build a grand coalition which would either force Babur out of India or else confine him to Afghanistan. In early 1527, Babur started receiving reports of Sanga's advance towards Agra. It was treachery of a section of Sanga's army that resulted in his defeat.|$|E

Musalia however refused to resign as the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Kenya citing that {{the office of the}} Deputy Prime minister is a political office therefore he would not resign. He then joined the Uhuru Kenyatta and Williams Ruto's Jubilee coalition briefly bringing together UDF,URP and TNA parties. However, Mudavadi left the coalition after a breach of contract which had stated that Uhuru Kenyatta would step down in his favour as the presidential flagbearer for the UDF/TNA/URP coalition. Uhuru surprised the nation by admitting that he signed the agreement but strongly defended his decision claiming he was coerced by [...] "dark forces". This <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> resulted from fierce objection by Uhuru's supporters who insisted that he must be the coalition's presidential aspirant and that any nominations had to be done through voting by party delegates. Mudavadi objected saying the front-runner should be agreed on by consensus because of the agreement with Uhuru {{and the fact that the}} delegates themselves had not been selected through grassroots elections.|$|E

But Russian government didn’t want to complicate relations with Persia and Ottoman Empire and to change the order of political forces in the South Caucasus. Graph Panin, minister of foreign affairs in his letter informed Fatali khan that the empress “confers him to goodwill of Russian Empire for his diligence”, but can’t accept him to citizenship, because it can be a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> among Russia, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. Board of foreign affairs pointed to Fatali khan that he hasn’t even a small right to deviate from “Persian dependence” and “submission to this power” because of their “integrated nature and common faith”. In the end of year Russian army was withdrawn from Dagestan to Kizlyar. In September, 1775 Catherine II wrote to G.A.Potyemkin: [...] "We should give the keys of Derbent back and reinstate Fatali khan in order to improve diligent, but troublesome and negligent act of Demedem gloriously".
