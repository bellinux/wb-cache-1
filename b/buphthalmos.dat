50|$|The {{diagnosis}} is clinical. The intraocular pressure (IOP) {{can be measured}} in the office in a conscious swaddled infant using a Tonopen or hand-held Goldmann tonometer. Usually, the IOP in normal infants is in the range of 11-14 mmHg. <b>Buphthalmos</b> and Haab's striae can often be seen in case of congenital glaucoma.|$|E
50|$|<b>Buphthalmos</b> {{in itself}} is merely a {{clinical}} sign and does not generate symptoms. Patients with glaucoma often initially have no symptoms; later, they can exhibit excessive tearing (lacrimation) and extreme sensitivity to light (photophobia). On ophthalmologic exam, one can detect increased intraocular pressure, distortion of the optic disc, and corneal edema, which manifests as haziness.|$|E
50|$|Infantile glaucoma, {{which often}} {{produces}} the clinical sign of <b>buphthalmos,</b> {{can be caused}} when an abnormally narrow angle between the cornea and iris blocks the outflow of aqueous humor; this causes increased intraocular pressure and eventual enlargement of the globe (eyeball).

40|$|A 10 month {{old girl}} was {{referred}} to our glaucoma department with the tentative diagnosis of unilateral <b>buphthalmos.</b> The parents had noticed photophobia, epiphora and an opaque cornea {{on the left side}} since one month. An intra-ocular pressure of 50 mmHg had been measured in that eye under sedation by the consulted ophthalmologist. On clinical examination, there was an opaque megalocornea with esodeviation on the left. The right eye appeared normal. Because of the photophobia and the opaque cornea, fundoscopy was not possible without sedation. The working diagnosis remained left <b>buphthalmos</b> and a trabeculotomy was planned. Examination under general anesthesia revealed corneal oedema, a shallow anterior chamber with an atrophic iris and engorged iris vessels on the left side. Since a shallow anterior chamber is not a typical feature of <b>buphthalmos,</b> an expansive process in the posterior segment was suspected. Fundoscopy only revealed a red reflex in {{the upper part of the}} eye; details could not be visualized because of corneal edema. The right eye had a normal anterior and posterior segment. Ultrasonography revealed a large mass in the left vitreous space. Calcifications within this mass were suspected on the bases of retro-shadows, making the diagnosis of retinoblastoma very likely. CT was also consistent with this diagnosis. The left eye was enucleated and subjected to histopathological analyses. The pathological findings will be discussed.

40|$|THE term microcornea {{should be}} {{reserved}} for the condition wherein an abnormally small cornea (diameter less than 11 mm.) occurs in an otherwise relatively normal eye (Mann, 1957). Friede (1922) suggested the term "anterior microphthalmos", because {{the whole of the}} anterior segment of the eye seems to be small. The rectus muscles are inserted abnormally far forwards, and the corneal curvature tends to be increased so that the corneal refraction is relatively great and the eye tends to be myopic. The total refraction may be almost emmetropic (Mann, 1957). Vision is usually unaffected, but the condition may occur coincidentally with <b>buphthalmos</b> (Fransois and Neetens, 1955); or <b>buphthalmos</b> may be present in the other eye (Srivastava, 1961). In some cases it is difficult to distinguish between anterior microcornea and microphthalmos. Associated ocular anomalies include colobo-mata, persistent pupillary membrane, mesoblastic tissue in the angle of the anterior chamber, microphakia, congenital cataract, microblepharon, and smallness of the orbit and extra-ocular muscles.

40|$|ABSTRACT Chickens {{raised from}} 2 to 14 weeks {{of age in}} {{continuous}} darkness (OL: 24 D) de-veloped shallow anterior chambers and <b>buphthalmos</b> (megaloglobus). Chickens raised in continu-ous darkness developed ocular changes similar to that reported in chickens raised in continuous fluorescent and incandescent light and in dim light. Corneal diameters and axial globe lengths were an inconsistent means of documenting ocular enlargement. Iridocorneal angles Were narrowed on scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Intraocular pressure (IOP) was not different from con-trol chickens. The chicken is proposed as a model to study ocular development, the effects of lid suture on infants, axial myopia, preglaucomatous changes, and possibly pharmacologic effects of antiglaucoma preparations. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Walker-Warburg {{syndrome}} (WWS) is an {{autosomal recessive}} condition characterised by congenital muscular dystrophy, structural brain defects, and eye malformations. Typical brain abnormalities are hydrocephalus, lissencephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, fusion of the hemispheres, cerebellar hypoplasia, and neuronal overmigration, which causes a cobblestone cortex. Ocular abnormalities include cataract, microphthalmia, <b>buphthalmos,</b> and Peters anomaly. WWS patients show defective O-glycosylation of Î±-dystroglycan (Î±-DG), which {{plays a key}} role in bridging the cytoskeleton of muscle and CNS cells with extracellular matrix proteins, important for muscle integrity and neuronal migration. In 20 % of the WWS patients, hypoglycosylation results from mutations in either the protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT 1), fukutin, or fukutin related protein (FKRP) genes. The other genes for this highly heterogeneous disorder remain to be identified...|$|E
30|$|OPNF is a hamartoma of neuroectodermal origin {{accounting}} for 1 - 2 Â % of all orbital tumours, typically arising {{in the first}} decade of life. OPNF is diagnostic of NF- 1. OPNF can involve any peripheral nerve, but the sensory nerves of the orbit are commonly involved. It is usually associated with other findings of NF- 1 such as ONG, sphenoid wing dysplasia, and <b>buphthalmos.</b> OPNF usually presents with nodular periorbital masses, loss of vision, and proptosis. The infiltrative serpentine masses extend in both the intraconal and extraconal compartments. Progressive glaucoma, optic nerve atrophy, and blindness are eventual complications. The risk of malignant sarcomatous degeneration is about 10 Â %. ONSF are usually not amenable to surgery; however, debulking may be necessary for preservation of vision or cosmetics [4, 26, 78].|$|E
40|$|Animal studied A 6 -year-old, {{pregnant}} female llama experienced a 6 -month history of epiphora, <b>buphthalmos,</b> and acute {{loss of vision}} in the left eye.

Procedures Transpalpebral enucleation was performed and an intraorbital silicone prosthesis was implanted. The eye was fixed in formalin and processed according to routine paraffin technique. Sections of a mass were immunohistochemically prepared routinely and stained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S-antigen, and rhodopsin. Results Gross, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed a retinal tumor consistent with a retinoblastoma.

40|$|Purpose. To {{report an}} untypical {{presentation}} of a presumed Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS), and to highlight the indispensable value of thorough clinical examination as primary means for proper diagnosis and management. Methods. Chart review. Results. A 7 year-old boy, {{with a long history}} of ocular symptoms and an unspecified ocular surgery, presents with a painful blind left eye. Based on clinical examination, the suspicion of SWS was raised. The presentation was not typical in the sense that no evident port-wine stain was observed on the face. However, facial asymmetry and gum discoloration were guiding clinical clues to pursue further investigations. Unfortunately, due to poor treatment response, the patient underwent enucleation. Tissue pathology revealed diffuse choroidal hemangiomas, consistent with the diagnosis of SWS. Conclusion. SWS presents with hamartomatous malformations and venous dilation affecting the skin, central nervous system and eye. The ocular involvement may vary, with the most common complications being glaucoma, <b>buphthalmos</b> and diffuse choroidal hemangiomas.

40|$|CASES of {{pulsating}} exophthalmos, {{which are}} seen {{from time to}} time, are mostly vascular in origin. Rarely they are due to transmitted cerebral pulsations, as in congenital failure of the orbital roof, erosion of the walls due to inflammatory processes, and traumatic hiatus of the orbital roof. Occasionally they are due to plexiform neurofibromatosis. von Recklinghausen (1882) first described a combination of melanomata and multiple neurofibromata arising from cutaneo-us nerve filaments.

He was on maximal medical therapy with an intraocular pressure (IOP) maintained at mid to low twenties. His right eye, the only seeing eye, had a BCVA of 6 / 9. This eye had undergone multiple glaucoma laser and surgical procedures, including an initial first Molteno drainage device inserted superonasally that failed in April 2003 due to fibrotic membrane over the tube opening. As a result, he subsequently had a second Molteno drainage device inserted inferotemporally. To further maximize his vision he had an uncomplicated cataract extraction and intraocular lens implant in December 2004, after which he developed postoperative cystoid macular edema and corneal endothelial failure. He underwent a penetrating keratoplasty in the right eye thereafter in March 2007.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of the various eye-related causes of photophobia and the likely mechanisms responsible. Photophobia is the experience of discomfort affecting the eyes as a result of exposure to light. It has a variety of causes, including the result of eye or brain disease, or it can be a side effect of various drugs or laser surgery. Photophobia can also be a symptom of a more serious disorder such as meningitis and therefore, requires appropriate investigation, diagnosis, and treatment. Trauma or disease affecting several structures of the eye are a common cause of photophobia and can be associated with: (1) the ocular adnexia, such as blepharitis and blepharospasm, (2) the cornea, including abrasion, ulcerative keratitis, and corneal dystrophy, (3) problems in eye development, such as aniridia, <b>buphthalmos,</b> coloboma, and aphakia, (4) various eye inflammations, including uveitis, and (5) retinal disorders, such as achromatopsia, retinal detachment, and retinal dystrophy. There may be two main explanations for photophobia associated with these conditions: (1) direct stimulation of the trigeminal nerve due to damage, disease, or excessive light entering the eye and (2) overstimulation of the retina including a specific population of light-sensitive ganglion cells...|$|E

To make these children useful citizens in future, special facilities are to be provided to these children for their education and training. A study was done to find out the visual status of the students studying in a blind school in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the only such facility in the region. Method: A total of 50 patients were examined during our visit to the blind school in Abbottabad. Age of the patients ranged from 6 to 27 years (mean: 12. 32 years). All the students, who were otherwise healthy, were included in the study. Result: The most common disorder identified was malformed globe or traumatic eyes (16 cases, 32 %), in most of the cases, leading to phthisis bulbi.
