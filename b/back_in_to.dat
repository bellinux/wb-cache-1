5|$|Caio Duilios first wartime patrol {{took place}} on 31 August. She {{and the rest of}} the fleet sailed to {{intercept}} the British battleship , which was steaming to Alexandria, and a convoy sailing to Malta. The Italian fleet did not have sufficient aerial reconnaissance, which, along with bad weather, prevented the Italians from locating the British forces. They put <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> Taranto on 1 September. Caio Duilio again put to sea on 7 September, in an attempt to catch the British Force H, but the Italian intelligence was faulty, as Force H was in the process of attacking Dakar. Caio Duilio returned to Taranto, where she remained until early November.|$|E

25|$|The {{air traffic}} {{controller}} had instructed a Boeing 707 to take off and help guide the 757 <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> land, but before the 707 could take off, the 757's left wingtip struck the water, approximately 25 minutes after the emergency declaration, revealing to the crew the true altitude of the airliner; the pilots struggled with the controls and managed to get airborne again for 17 seconds, but the aircraft crashed inverted into the water. All 70 passengers and crew died. The official accident report concluded that the flight crew, distracted by the conflicting warnings, did not heed the radar altimeter reading after descending through 2,500 feet.|$|E
25|$|When the cricket ball {{is inside}} the boundary, it is live. When the ball is {{touching}} the boundary, grounded beyond the boundary, or being touched by a fielder who is himself either touching the boundary or grounded beyond it, it is dead and the batting side usually scores 4 or 6 runs for hitting the ball over the boundary. Because of this rule, fielders near the boundary attempting to intercept the ball while running or diving, often flick the ball <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the field of play rather than pick it up directly, because their momentum could carry them beyond the rope while holding the ball. They {{then return to the}} field to pick the ball up and throw it back to the bowler.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Irish Fusiliers {{pushed through}} the {{northern}} end of the town, fighting was stubborn and hard; two German Panzer MKIII's created the most problems; there were no British tanks up in support and these were knocked out eventually by PIAT weapons. The Irish brigade then had the difficult task of house to house fighting which proved difficult against the tough paratroopers, by the evening it was thought the town was cleared but the Germans counterattacked and although it was largely repelled some units sneaked <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> snipe as the Irish cleared the streets and houses. Throughout the night more men from 38th Brigade moved into the town to reinforce those already there. Finally the Germans launched another counterattack but this time it was weak and easily repelled after which resistance began to fade.|$|E

25|$|SIUE hosted Missouri State in a Tuesday night MVC match. The Bears, {{riding a}} three-game win streak, struck early, {{tallying}} on a 3rd minute corner that was {{headed into the}} net. The Cougars got the tying goal in the 34th minute, when MSU was called for a handball in the box, and Ledbetter nailed his third penalty kick of the season. The game then became a typical Valley defensive struggle, as both offenses pushed, but both defenses pushed back harder. Late in regulation time, the Bears turned away a Cougar corner kick, but McHugh sent it <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> Ledbetter, who headed it toward the goal and McLean. who scored his second game-winner with only {{a minute and a}} half left on the clock. The win upped the Cougars' unbeaten run to five games.|$|E
25|$|The team {{travelled}} 160 {{miles north}} after the disastrous First Test {{to play at}} Gympie. The Queensland Country XI Thomas Allen won the toss and batted. Allen himself top-scored with 53, with Len Johnson making 40 and Herbert Zischke 32. Peter Smith proved useful in another minor game and took 5/80 as the home side were dismissed for 208. The reserve openers Paul Gibb (31) and Laurie Fishlock (62) made an opening stand of 82, Joe Hardstaff stroked his way to 64 and the all rounder James Langridge 42. The local fast bowler Tim Ball took 5/69 and Len Johnson 3/51 as the MCC were out for 282, but the leg-breaks of Don Tallon's brother Bill were hit for 0/73. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> bat the Queensland XI made a solid 311/9 with James Cockburn (41), Tim Allen (40), Colin Stribe (75) and Keith Gartell (52 not out) seeing out the draw.|$|E
25|$|On the Tibetan leader's journey {{home from}} his year in China, Khampa and Amdowa clan leaders {{informed}} {{his chief of staff}} of their plans to rebel against the Chinese in retribution for land confiscation and attacks on monasteries. But all was relatively quiet in Lhasa and in April 1956 he received a Chinese delegation to inaugurate the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet: a 51-man committee composed mostly of Tibetans. Meanwhile, open rebellion began with the massacre of a Communist garrison in Kham which left an estimated 800 Chinese dead, sparking air strikes that killed more Tibetans. In addition, the CIA met with the Dalai Lama's two brothers Thubten Jigme Norbu and Gyalo Thondup in India and offered to train a pilot group of six Khampas in guerrilla warfare and radio communications in Saipan. They were smuggled out of Tibet and would later be parachuted <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> train others and to report back to the CIA on the insurgency's progress and needs.|$|E

25|$|Ponting {{chose not}} to enforce the {{follow-on}} and put his team <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> bat, a decision which surprised the majority of spectators and media personnel. Australia's lead of 445 going into the second innings {{was one of the}} largest ever held by a team which had then decided not to enforce the follow-on. This decision was in contrast to Michael Vaughan's decision in the 4th Test of the 2005 series, where he had enforced the follow-on with Australia just 259 runs behind. As on the opening day, England's bowling attack was again barely able to penetrate Australia's defences, and the home side were able to end the day on 1/181, the only loss being Matthew Hayden who was run out on 37 by James Anderson while attempting a risky second run. Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting ended the day unbeaten, with Langer on 88, and Ponting on 51 having scored his 9,000th test run during the innings. The day was the third in a row which had gone badly for England and with the pitch showing wide cracks, offering encouragement to Shane Warne in particular, an Australian victory was widely expected at the close of play.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Blackpool Transport, having {{completed}} its OMO rebuild programme, was still {{left with a}} significant surplus of cash. Using a redundant Balloon (725), BTS set to work on creating an experimental double-deck OMO car. It was completed in 1979; unlike the OMOs {{it did not have}} centre doors and had a much more bus-like appearance. It was thought a success, so a second was created using another redundant Balloon (714), which unlike the first, retained its centre doors. They were numbered 761 and 762 respectively. Although a success and a big crowd-mover, no more were built. The pair carried on in service until the modernisation of the tramway in 2011–2012. Both cars are preserved; 761 by the Blackpool Heritage Trust and 762 by the National Tramway Museum in Derbyshire. After a long period of refurbishment, 762 carried out test runs at the museum and re-entered service in September 2014. 761, meanwhile, was preserved by the Fleetwood Heritage Leisure Trust and was in outside storage until December 2013 when it was moved <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> Blackpool Transport's Rigby Road Depot. In May 2017, 761 was transferred from the Fleetwood Heritage Leisure Trust to Blackpool Heritage Trust. Both cars carried many colourful advertising liveries throughout their lives and both still carry one in preservation; 762 in particular wears a very bright scheme advertising an attraction at Blackpool's Pleasure Beach theme park.|$|E
