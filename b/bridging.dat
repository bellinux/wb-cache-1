5|$|<b>Bridging</b> wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. <b>Bridging</b> across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. <b>Bridging</b> across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E
5|$|In {{inorganic}} chemistry, hydrides {{can also}} serve as <b>bridging</b> ligands that link two metal centers in a coordination complex.

Although Okada {{attempted}} the Rainmaker three more times, Tanahashi countered with a <b>bridging</b> straitjacket German suplex, a <b>bridging</b> dragon suplex, a series of dragon-screw legwhips, and three High Fly Flows. The first was a crossbody while Okada was on the ropes; the second a frog splash to a seated Okada, and the third another frog splash, after which Tanahashi scored a pinfall on Okada to retain the title at 30 minutes and 57 seconds. Okada wept as he left the ring, and Tanahashi shouted that his opponent had {{a long way to go}} before becoming the New Japan ace.

5|$|The 130th Engineer Brigade {{focused on}} <b>bridging</b> {{projects}} as was its specialty, but it ultimately found itself undertaking numerous different projects {{throughout the country}} for much of 2003 and into 2004. Not all of its units were confined entirely to construction, though. The 502nd Engineer Company also conducted river patrol operations in Baghdad and Tikrit. This new mission for the company was essential for force protection, troop transportation, search and cordon operations, and to protect against sabotage on fixed bridges. In September 2003, with the inactivation of the 38th Engineer Company (Medium Girder Bridge), the 502nd Engineer Company became a multi-role bridge company with both float and fixed <b>bridging</b> capabilities and the only active bridge company in USAREUR.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} was brought forward by {{one day to}} 20 September. The change of schedule caused the JNA 1st Guards Mechanised Division to commit to battle as it arrived in eastern Slavonia with no reconnaissance or preparation. The resulting traffic jam on the ŠidTovarnikStari Jankovci road prevented <b>bridging</b> units from reaching the Bosut River. That in turn prevented the 1st Guards Division from crossing the river and confined it to the area between the Bosut and the Danube, east of Vinkovci. Besides the <b>bridging</b> units, the division did not receive the 80th Motorised Brigadewhich appears to have disintegrated before reaching the Croatian frontierand the 2nd Guards Mechanised Brigadea victim of friendly fire bombardment in the area between Tovarnik and Ilača adjacent to the border.
