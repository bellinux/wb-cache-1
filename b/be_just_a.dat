Owen {{supports}} her decision as he realizes no good could come from him asking her to stay, but requests her not to leave him until she has to leave him for good, following which, they both spend two weeks leading to her permanent departure together. While saying her farewell to her colleagues of the last seven years, there is a possible act of terrorism in Seattle, which later turns out to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> gas main explosion. Cristina has a quick but emotional goodbye hug with Derek, Bailey, and Webber, leaves her shares of the hospital to Alex, and dances it out with Meredith one last time to an old favorite song. Owen, however, is busy saving a patient in the O.R., so they share a silent goodbye through the gallery's glass.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E
5|$|That {{game was}} Computer Space, {{developed}} by Bushnell and Ted Dabney. They {{had found the}} Data General Nova, a US$4,000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of Spacewar at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would be much less expensive: as low as $100. By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed {{for a short time}} in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy. Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that Galaxy Game was not a real competitor to Computer Space, due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that Galaxy Game was a true expansion of Spacewar, while Computer Space just a pale imitation. Some players at the time, however, believed Galaxy Game to actually <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> version of Spacewar!. Galaxy Games prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan.|$|E

25|$|The {{center of}} mass (barycenter) of the Pluto–Charon system lies outside either body.

The network had cancelled a mainstay variety show hosted by Red Skelton and would cancel The Ed Sullivan Show in 1971 because they had become too expensive to produce and attracted, in the executives' opinion, too old an audience. Gleason simply stopped doing the show in 1970 and left CBS when his contract expired.|$|E

25|$|Simple {{heuristics}} like hill climbing, which move {{by finding}} better neighbour after better neighbour and stop {{when they have}} reached a solution which has no neighbours that are better solutions, cannot guarantee to lead {{to any of the}} existing better solutions – their outcome may easily <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> local optimum, while the actual best solution would be a global optimum. Metaheuristics use the neighbours of a solution as a way to explore the solutions space, and although they prefer better neighbours, they also accept worse neighbours in order to avoid getting stuck in local optima; they can find the global optimum if run for a long enough amount of time.|$|E

Even without knowing the upcoming German offensive, Allied planners estimated the earliest date for a large thrust into Germany for mid-January.|$|E

25|$|In the Umm al-kitab, Azazel is {{the first}} {{emanation}} of the high king (original God) and loaned the power of creation from the true God. Therefore he claimed to be an independent God, besides the high king. After that, the high king made a new creation which exceeded the creatures of Azazel. After he remains refusing to confess to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> creature, emanated from the true God, he is banished into lower spheres. Every time he refuses again to accept the new creation Salman, he is banished again into lower regions, until he reaches the earth. The earth is according to the Umm al-kitab created out of the essence of Azazels creation, while humans and lifeforce originated from the heavenly realm. Since Azazel is banished into the material world, he seduces the humans, leads them into his realm and tries to keep human trapped in there. He resembles to the gnostic demiurge.|$|E

This injury ruled him out of Kilkenny's successful National league campaign. A damaged metatarsal delayed his recovery resulting in him missing Kilkenny's opening championship games. Shefflin made his return to hurling when he was introduced {{for the last five}} minutes of Kilkenny's 0-20 to 1-14 qualifier defeat of Tipperary. He was included on the starting fifteen for Kilkenny's subsequent All-Ireland quarter-final against Cork. Just before half time Shefflin received a second yellow card and was red carded {{for the first time in}} his championship career. Kilkenny went on to lose the game by 0-19 to 0-14.
