5|$|One day {{somebody}} in the crowd identified me. Standing <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> was a woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never heard me called by name before.

25|$|In 1900 he {{took his}} common-law wife Natalia Nordman to the World Exhibition in Paris, where {{he served as a}} {{painting}} judge. He visited Munich, the Tyrol, and Prague, and painted Natalia Nordman in a Tyrolese Hat and In the Sunlight: Portrait of Nadezhda Repina. In 1901 he was awarded the Legion of Honor. His painting Get Thee <b>Behind</b> <b>Me,</b> Satan! was shown at the 29th Itinerants' Society Exhibition. In 1902–1903 his works included the paintings Ceremonial Meeting of the State Council and What a Freedom!, over forty portrait studies, and portraits of Sergei Witte and Vyacheslav von Plehve. Ceremonial Meeting of the State Council was the most demanding work commissioned by Repin, requiring numerous studies of the 100 councilors depicted, and the help of two of Repin's pupils.|$|E
25|$|In 1863, {{the theatre}} closed for {{extensive}} alterations and improvements by C. J. Phipps, who was later {{the architect of}} the Savoy Theatre (1881), the Lyric Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue (1888), Her Majesty's Theatre (1897) and many others. The capacity of the theatre was at this time 889. The Olympic reopened with performances of The Girl I Left <b>Behind</b> <b>Me</b> and The Hidden Hand and My Wife's Bonnet in November 1864. Burnand's contributions in the 1860s included Fair Rosamond – The Maze, The Maid, and The Monarch; Deerfoot; Robin Hood – or, The Forrester's Fate!; Cupid and Psyche – or, Beautiful as a Butterfly; Acis and Galatæa – or, The Nimble Nymph and the Terrible Troglodyte! and King of the Merrows – or, The Prince and the Piper. Morton's plays included Ticklish Times; A Husband to Order; A Regular Fix!; and Gotobed Tom!. In 1870, W. S. Gilbert became another of the theatre's notable authors, producing The Princess.

25|$|Percussionist Evelyn Glennie has {{collaborated with}} Björk {{and can be}} heard playing the marimba on Post and Telegram, as well as Oxygen. Thompson Twins {{included}} marimba in their many 1980s works. Jack White played marimba on The Nurse, a song on The White Stripes' album Get <b>Behind</b> <b>Me</b> Satan. In 2003, Marina Calzado Linage recorded an album bridging the gap between academic and popular music, Marimba de Buenos Aires, featuring music by Ástor Piazzolla. In 2009, Canadian musician Spencer Krug, working under the moniker Moonface, released a 20-minute continuous piece called Dreamland EP: Marimba And Shit-Drums with Jagjaguwar. The recording consists entirely of marimba, drums and vocals and comprises many movements and recurring themes. Vincent Montana Jr. played the marimba {{on one of the}} great socially conscious soul songs of the early 1970s People Make the World Go Round by The Stylistics. The experimental band Coil (band) used the marimba in its later performances such as Selvaggina, Go Back into the Woods and studio albums The Ape of Naples and Black Antlers.|$|E

25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat <b>behind</b> <b>me.</b> At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E
500|$|In a 2013 interview, {{the band}} {{revealed}} that they partied heavily during {{the production of}} Follow the Leader, with massive amounts of alcohol, drugs, {{and women in the}} studio.

500|$|The verse {{may be one}} of few English nursery rhymes to have ancient origins. The Babylonian prayer [...] "Shamash before me, <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> Sin, Nergal at my right, Ninib at my left", {{is echoed}} by the medieval Jewish prayer: [...] "In the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, may Michael be at my right hand; Gabriel at my left; Uriel before me; Raphael <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> and the Shekhinah of God be above my head" [...] which is used as a prayer before sleep. A Christian version has been found for Germany {{at the end of the}} Medieval period. However, the first known record of the lyrics in English is from Thomas Ady's {{witchcraft}} treatise A Candle in the Dark, or, a treatise concerning the nature of witches and witchcraft (1656), which tells of a woman in Essex who claimed to have lived in the reign of Mary I (r. 1553-8) and who was alive in his time and blessed herself every night with the [...] "popish charm": ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{according}} to an interview with David Fricke of Rolling Stone, Jack began working on songs for the band's next album at his home. He played with different techniques than in past albums, trading in his electric guitar for an acoustic on {{all but a few}} of the tracks, as his trademark riff-based lead guitar style is overtaken by a predominantly rhythmic approach. The White Stripes' fifth album, Get <b>Behind</b> <b>Me</b> Satan, was released in 2005 on the V2 label. The title is an allusion to a Biblical quotation Jesus made to the Apostle Simon Peter from the [...] of the New Testament (in the King James Version, the quotation is slightly different: [...] "Get thee <b>behind</b> <b>me,</b> Satan"). Jack has said it has a double meaning: that Satan should physically be behind him or that Satan should support him. Another theory about this title is that Jack and Meg White read James Joyce's story collection [...] "Dubliners" [...] (published 1914) and used a line from the final story [...] "The Dead" [...] to title this album.|$|E
