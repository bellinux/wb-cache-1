5|$|The Barry Docks West <b>Breakwater</b> Light, a {{white cast}} iron tower at head of the west <b>breakwater,</b> was built in 1890.|$|E
5|$|As First Lord, St Vincent also {{determined}} {{to build a}} <b>breakwater</b> in Plymouth. The First Lord commissioned a civil engineer, John Rennie, and Joseph Whidbey, the former Master-Attendant at Woolwich dockyard, to design the <b>breakwater.</b> Work did not begin until 1811 but the earl is widely credited as the force behind its construction.|$|E
5|$|Porporela {{was built}} in 1873, next to St. John Fortress. The Kase jetty (Kaše <b>Breakwater)</b> {{was built in}} 1485, {{according}} {{to the design of}} Paskoje Miličević, in order to defend the harbour and protect it from south-eastern winds and waves. The <b>breakwater</b> thus shortened the harbour's bulky chain stretched in the night from the St. John Fortress to St. Luke's tower. It was constructed of huge stone blocks laid over wooden foundations without binder.|$|E
40|$|<b>Breakwaters</b> {{are widely}} used in coastal development. <b>Breakwaters</b> can alter {{habitats}} by undermining shallow coastal ecosystems, especially coral reefs. However, recent studies indicate that mature <b>breakwaters</b> can have well-developed corals and coral-associated fishes. <b>Breakwaters</b> with colonized corals may act as surrogates of natural coral reefs against the global coral crisis. Here, we examined the composition of corals, fishes, and benthic biota/abiota between natural reefs and mature <b>breakwaters</b> to evaluate the possibility of <b>breakwaters</b> supplementing natural reefs. We found equal or higher coral cover, fish abundance, and species richness on <b>breakwaters.</b> Conversely, differential coral growth forms and fish assemblages on mature <b>breakwaters</b> suggested the irreplaceability of natural reefs. Corals and coral reef fishes on mature man-made structures, however, may improve the resistance and resilience of coral reefs. Conclusively, despite high coral cover on mature man-made structures appropriate management (e. g., marine reserves) is still necessary to sustain the coral reefs...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{detailed}} review of Indian research {{studies on the}} development of innovative <b>breakwaters</b> is attempted. Historical studies by Indian researchers and scientists were collected and classified in to two broad categories; fixed and floating <b>breakwaters.</b> The first part, Part I, discusses the studies pertaining to different types of fixed <b>breakwaters,</b> whereas, the Part II describes the studies related to floating <b>breakwaters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Floating <b>breakwaters</b> {{provide an}} {{alternative}} form of wave barrier to conventional rubble mound and caisson <b>breakwaters</b> in low to moderate wave climates with relatively short wave periods. This report reviews {{the literature on}} floating <b>breakwaters</b> and discusses existing and potential uses of floating <b>breakwaters</b> in Australia. It also contains results of a field programme which measured the prototype performances of two <b>breakwaters</b> in Sydney Harbour and compared them with those predicted using physical models. The programme was carried out using low cost wave measuring equipment specially developed for this study...|$|R
5|$|Along the shoreline, blizzards {{shut down}} traffic and communication, causing {{hundreds}} of thousands of dollars in damage. A 22-inch (56cm) snowfall in Cleveland, Ohio, put stores out of business for two days. There were four-foot (122cm) snowdrifts around Lake Huron. Power was out for several days across Michigan and Ontario, cutting off telephone and telegraph communications. A recently completed US$100,000 Chicago <b>breakwater,</b> intended to protect the Lincoln Park basin from storms, was swept away in a few hours. The Milwaukee harbor lost its entire south <b>breakwater</b> and much of the surrounding South Park area that had been recently renovated.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{is listed}} as a contributing property for Bridgeport's Seaside Park historic district, which was listed on July 1, 1982. The grounds are accessible by parking at Seaside Park and crossing a <b>breakwater,</b> but the lighthouse is not open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Various {{structures}} {{have been}} identified {{in the area of the}} port, including retaining walls, a possible <b>breakwater</b> and a quay. The port appears to have been partially enclosed by an artificial peninsula.|$|E
40|$|Stability of hardly {{reshaping}} berm <b>breakwaters</b> {{has been}} investigated in this paper, mainly focusing on exposure to long waves. The study continues previous work by Aalborg University, which suggested that stability of berm <b>breakwaters</b> follow the plunging equation of the Van der Meer stability formula also in the surging domain. Different combinations of berm widths and elevations were tested {{in order to see}} if berm <b>breakwaters</b> in general follow the plunging formula or if they start to behave more like conventional <b>breakwaters...</b>|$|R
40|$|As one of {{the efforts}} to {{mitigate}} the effects of coastal erosion and preserve Louisiana 2 ̆ 7 s barrier islands and coastal wetlands, detached, segmented <b>breakwaters</b> were constructed along the east flank of Raccoon Island, south-central Louisiana. A monitoring program was established to quantify {{the influence of the}} <b>breakwaters</b> on nearshore waves and morphology. Beach profiles, extending {{from the edge of the}} vegetation line to the crown of the <b>breakwaters,</b> were surveyed across the centers and the tips of the <b>breakwaters,</b> and across the gaps between the structures. Nearshore wave conditions were measured using pressure transducers deployed seaward, in the lee, between the gaps, and at a control site away from the influence of the <b>breakwaters.</b> Preliminary results based on the first six months of monitoring indicate that initial shoreline adjustment, in the form of beach cusps, reached quasi-equilibrium approximately three months after construction. Significant sand accumulation directly landward of the <b>breakwaters</b> was measured during the six-month period. The influence of the <b>breakwaters</b> on the wave field was significantly different under normally and obliquely incident waves. A wave-height reduction of approximately 90...|$|R
30|$|The two <b>breakwaters</b> in {{the region}} reduce the effect of tsunami waves on the coast and port environments. However, wave {{overtopping}} was observed on the <b>breakwaters</b> after a while. It is possible that this overtopping discharge will damage the <b>breakwaters</b> and affect their stability. This may {{lead to an increase}} in tsunami inundation extent presented in this study.|$|R
5|$|After her naval service {{ended in}} 1919, she was {{returned}} to her original owners and resumed relatively uneventful cargo service over the next twenty years. Early in World War II, the ship was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration, and shipped cargo on New York– Caribbean routes and transatlantic routes. In mid-July 1944, Pennsylvanian was scuttled {{as part of the}} <b>breakwater</b> for one of the Mulberry artificial harbors built to support the Normandy Invasion.|$|E
5|$|August 27–28, 1878 – Streets are {{clogged with}} fallen trees as a {{hurricane}} passes to the north. At {{the height of}} a storm, a floating dry dock—the largest ever built at the time—is damaged after breaking from its moorings at HM Dockyard, crushing wharves and a mooring bridge. The dock came to rest on a <b>breakwater.</b>|$|E
5|$|Catawba {{was renamed}} Atahualpa, after the Emperor Atahualpa, the last {{ruler of the}} Inca Empire. To prepare the ship for her lengthy voyage to Peru around Cape Horn, Swift & Co. added a <b>breakwater</b> on the bow, stepped two masts with a fore-and-aft rig to {{supplement}} her engine, and provided closures to make vents and deck openings water tight.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of large scale physical model investigations on the hydraulic performance of rock armoured rubble mound <b>breakwaters.</b> The energy dissipation characteristics of conventional trapezoidal layered <b>breakwaters</b> and berm <b>breakwaters,</b> both statically and dynamically stable are presented.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the hydroelastic responses and hydrodynamic interactions of two large floating fuel storage modules placed side-by-side with the presence of floating <b>breakwaters.</b> These modules and <b>breakwaters</b> form the floating fuel storage facility (FFSF). The floating storage modules and <b>breakwaters</b> are modeled as plates and the linear wave theory is used to model the water waves in the numerical model. The numerical model is verified with existing numerical results and validated with experimental test. Numerical simulations are performed to determine the hydroelastic behavior and hydrodynamic interactions of floating storage modules placed adjacent to each other and enclosed by floating <b>breakwaters</b> under various incident wave angles. The effects of <b>breakwaters,</b> drafts, channel spacing formed by the two adjacent modules and water depth on the hydroelastic responses of the modules are investigated. The wave induced responses of multiple floating storage modules enclosed by floating <b>breakwaters</b> are also examined...|$|R

5|$|During the Second World War, {{the ship}} was rearmed with light weapons and was {{converted}} into a blockship and was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets. Centurion {{was sent to the}} Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians quickly figured out the deception. The ship was deliberately sunk during the Invasion of Normandy in 1944 to form a <b>breakwater.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1846, the Plymouth and Padstow Railway company took an {{interest}} in trying to remove the Doom Bar, hoping to increase trade through the harbour at Padstow. The plan was to create a <b>breakwater</b> on the bar, which would stop the build-up of sand, and the railway would transport sand from the nearby dunes to where it was needed for agricultural purposes elsewhere in the south west.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, {{two people}} were killed with two others {{reported}} missing. A South Korean freighter rode out the storm at the port in Hakata Bay. It breached along the <b>breakwater,</b> causing it to sink, killing all 10crew members. The Japan Coast Guard launched a search and rescue mission for two days.|$|E
40|$|Benthic assemblages were {{compared}} {{inside and outside}} submerged <b>breakwaters</b> along Lido Adriano-Punta Marina coast in autumn 2004 and late spring 2005. While in the cold period no differences were evident in the benthic community composition and structure {{inside and outside the}} <b>breakwaters,</b> the warmer period was characterized by huge differences. Together with accumulation of macroalgae, the benthic community inside <b>breakwaters</b> was dominated by species more typical of stagnant environments...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a new overtopping formula for berm <b>breakwaters.</b> Overtopping data from hydraulic model tests of berm <b>breakwaters</b> have been gathered and reanalysed in line with the procedure in the EurOtop Manual. The data shows a clear dependency on wave period or wave steepness, which is in contrast to the main conclusion of the CLASH project and the EurOtop Manual for conventional rubble mound <b>breakwaters.</b> The formula is roughly validated on prototype performance...|$|R
5000|$|KOLOS is a {{concrete}} interlocking armour unit {{intended to protect}} coastal structures like seawalls and <b>breakwaters</b> from the ocean waves. These blocks were developed in India and were first adopted for the <b>breakwaters</b> of the Krishnapatnam Port along the East coast of India.|$|R
5|$|Not {{all of the}} ship's mishaps were storm-related. In late April 1911, Kroonland hit the <b>breakwater</b> in Dover Harbour, {{disabling}} {{the steering}} gear and delaying the ship by a day. On 8 January 1913, Kroonland ran aground in Ambrose Channel during a heavy fog while outbound from New York. It took more than six hours for tugs to free the liner from the soft mud.|$|E

50|$|<b>Breakwaters</b> {{reduce the}} {{intensity}} of wave action in inshore waters and thereby reduce coastal erosion or provide safe harbourage. <b>Breakwaters</b> may also be small structures designed to protect a gently sloping beach and placed one to three hundred feet offshore in relatively shallow water.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the evolution of}} design techniques applied to mound <b>breakwaters</b> {{as well as some}} key tools, equipment and construction techniques. The influence of the theoretical and laboratory research is analyzed in detail, from the pioneering research by Iribarren eighty years ago to the construction of single-layer armored <b>breakwaters</b> in recent decades. The economic optimization and the new embodied energy and carbon concepts associated to the construction of mound <b>breakwaters</b> are studied. New concepts as well as the invention of new armor units are examined as is their impact based on the observations from small-scale physical experiments and the relevance of the equipment and logistic constraints to explain the evolution of the way mound <b>breakwaters</b> have been designed and built over time. </p...|$|R

5|$|While Connie was {{meandering}} in {{the western}} Atlantic Ocean, its potential track posed problems for forecasters. On August7, a hurricane warning was issued from North Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia, with a hurricane alert further north to New York City. The Weather Bureau later extended the hurricane warnings to Delaware <b>Breakwater,</b> with storm warnings further northeast to Provincetown, Massachusetts. The alert for North Carolina was up for about three days until Connie moved inland.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} fitted with three {{temporary}} masts for their delivery voyages, although only Cerberus had her freeboard raised {{with the addition}} of temporary bulwarks. The ships spent the bulk of their service lives in reserve and rarely, if ever, left their home port. Magdala was sold in January 1903, but Cerberus was hulked in 1900 and transferred to the Royal Australian Navy when it was formed in 1911. She was renamed HMAS Platypus II in 1918 and sold in 1924. Stripped of all salvageable material, she was scuttled in 1926 as a <b>breakwater,</b> and her remains are still visible today.|$|E
