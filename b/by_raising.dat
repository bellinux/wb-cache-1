Mental Health Inventory of Middle-School Students（MMHI 60 was applied on 427 students with different parenting experiences, who are from 3 junior high schools in Yibin city, Sichuan Province. The factor score of anxiety of students <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> grandparents is significantly higher than that of students <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> parents or jointly <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> parents and grandparents. A statistically significant difference is found between boy students <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> grandparents and those <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> parents or jointly <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> parents and grandparents in the mean of total score and the factor score of depression, psychological imbalance, interpersonal sensitivity and anxiety.

5|$|Chord {{inversion}} {{is especially}} simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply <b>by</b> <b>raising</b> {{one or two}} notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes. Thus, major and minor chords are played on two frets in M3tuning {{even when they are}} inverted. In contrast, inversions of chords in standard tuning require three fingers on a span of four frets, in standard tuning, the shape of inversions depends on the involvement of the irregular major-third.|$|E
5|$|Having exactly three pitch {{classes for}} its open notes (for example {C,E,G}), each major-thirds tuning repeats every note {{in a higher}} octave, because guitars have six strings.

5|$|A {{country with}} a large trade surplus would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases.

Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or <b>by</b> <b>raising</b> interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E
