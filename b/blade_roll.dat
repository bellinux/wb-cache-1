50|$|Heliogyro {{design is}} similar to the blades on a helicopter. The design is faster to {{manufacture}} due to lightweight centrifugal stiffening of sails.

The <b>blades</b> <b>roll</b> out when they are deploying after the ejection from the spacecraft.

40|$|Abstract Circular {{saw blades}} are very {{widespread}} in wood machining. They {{are used in}} different batches and sizes and in large quantities from hand tools to large machining centers. Because of this huge range of applications the circular saws have gained great importance in the industry. The rising request to improve the cutting quality, reduce the noise emission and increase the life time requires improvement of the dynamic behavior of the circular saw <b>blade.</b> The <b>roll</b> tensioning of the circular saw blade has been empirically established {{as a solution to}} improve the static and dynamic properties of the circular saw blade. However, there are several influencing parameters for this process that have not yet been studied scientifically accurate. A scientific and economical solution for the study of various roll tensioning parameters is a simulation model based on finite elements method (FEM) that analyzes the effects on the dynamic behavior of circular saw blade. A simulation model for roll tensioning of circular saw blades was developed in this study. With this simulation model, the residual stresses induced by the roll tensioning can be calculated. The induced residual stresses are actually responsible for the changing of dynamic properties of the circular saw blade, such as the shifting of eigenvalues and reduction of side run out. Furthermore, this simulation model allows the investigation of various roll tensioning parameters. This investigation helps {{to gain a better understanding}} of the relationship between roll tensioning and improvement of dynamic behavior of circular saw blades. Furthermore, it helps to determine the optimization potential of the roll tensioning process, which is one of the important stages of the production line of circular saw blades...|$|R
30|$|The {{tensioning}} {{stress distribution}} of circular saw <b>blade</b> after <b>roll</b> tensioning {{was described by}} Szymani [2]. In the inner loop of the tensioned region, the tangential tensioning stress is compressive, and its value increases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to inside. In the exterior loop of the tensioned region, the tangential tensioning stress is tensile, and its value decreases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to outside. This distribution of tangential tensioning stress is not very ideal relatively. The tangential tensioning stresses of circular saw blades tensioned by three levels of hammering were measured by X-ray stress meter [3, 4]. The tangential tensioning stress outside hammer region increases with radius, which is an ideal distribution. This phenomenon indicates that the distribution of tangential tensioning stress produced by hammering is more reasonable than that produced by roll tensioning. However, hammer tensioning has its limitations because the hammer tensioning creates a very irregular surface and produce localized, non-axisymmetric stresses because the force and position of spots are controlled by workers and its reproducibility and controllability {{are very difficult to}} be mastered, and it depends heavily on the experience and skills of saw repairing workers. The precision of hammer tensioning is relatively poor. Multi-spot pressure tensioning process is one kind of tensioning methods and a quasi-static process. The fixed areas of circular saw blade are pressed by spherical or cylindrical surface during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. The force and position of spots are controlled precisely by automated machinery during the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. A cyclic symmetry stress distribution and appropriate macroscopic deformation can be obtained by the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. Therefore, a more ideal distribution of tangential tensioning stress is produced during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. This tensioning approach is conducive to the realization of the automatic tensioning operation, especially in the production of ultra-thin circular saw blades.|$|R

Leaves: Leaf sheath is often hairy and leaf <b>blades</b> are <b>rolled.</b> Flowers: Inflorescence is an open panicle and often flushed with purple when growing in direct sunlight. September - March. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: • Similar to Geeldikkop. • Toxic principle: Steroidal saponins. MECHANISM OF ACTION: • Hydrolysis of a steroidal saponin to diosgenin with subsequent hydrogenation, reduction and epimerisation, which occurs in the rumen. • Epismilagenin and episarsasapogenin amongst others, are formed, absorbed and conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver to be excreted via the bile. • However, the epismilagenin and episarsasapogenin glucuronides bind to Ca 2 + to form an insoluble salt, which precipitates to form biliary crystals which obstruct the bile ducts. SYNDROMES: Dikoor. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Liver. CLINICAL SIGNS: Dikoor – similar to geeldikkop – distribution Free State and Highveld. Sheep condition mainly. Usually milder disease (probably due to farming practice – detected earlier and kept in shade etc.). NECROPSY: Identical to Geeldikkop - Clefts, etc. identical Macroscopical findings: • Icterus and photosensitivity. • Liver - enlarged khaki to yellow-brown. • Chalky white sediment in bile ducts and gall bladder. • Later small pits on surface although morphology never distorted as in F. E. • Kidneys swollen and light in colour, with small green spots distributed through cortex. HISTOPATHOLOGY: • Accumulation of crystalloid material in portal and intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts leading to partial or complete occlusion and concentric, lammellar periductal fibrosis. • Plate-like structures seen on section as clefts and on scanning EM as rose- like structures and/or debri in greater ducts. • Other pathological changes are present but are mostly secondary to this. TREATMENT: Keep in shade. Diet low in chorophyll. Antihistamines. Corticosteroids. Cholagogues. Liver supportive treatment. Valuable animals – barrier creams and tattoo ink will protect from sunburn.

Pratt & Whitney will provide the turbine blade and damper hardware for the tests. NASA will provide the facility and perform the tests. Effectiveness and durability will be investigated during and after sustained sweeps of rotor speed through resonance. Tests of a platform wedge damper are also planned to compare its effectiveness {{with that of the}} impact damper. Results from baseline tests without dampers will be used to measure damping effectiveness. The self-tuning impact damper combines two damping methods-the tuned mass damper and the impact damper. It consists of a ball located within a cavity in the <b>blade.</b> This ball <b>rolls</b> back and forth on a spherical trough under centrifugal load (tuned mass damper) and can strike the walls of the cavity (impact damper). The ball s rolling natural frequency is proportional to the rotor speed and can be designed to follow an engine-order line (integer multiple of rotor speed). Aerodynamic forcing frequencies typically follow these engineorder lines, and a damper tuned to the engine order will most effectively reduce blade vibrations when the resonant frequency equals the engine-order forcing frequency. This damper has been tested in flat plates and turbine blades in the Dynamic Spin Facility. During testing, a pair of plates or blades rotates in vacuum. Excitation is provided by one of three methods [...] eddy-current engine-order excitation (ECE), electromechanical shakers, and magnetic bearing excitation. The eddy-current system consists of magnets located circumferentially around the rotor. As a blade passes a magnet, a force is imparted on the blade. The number of magnets used can be varied to change the desired engine order of the excitation. The magnets are remotely raised or lowered to change the magnitude of the force on the blades. The other two methods apply force to the rotating shaft itself at frequencies independent of the rotor speed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was on the {{layering}} of fine paper with a 3 -layer headbox and <b>roll</b> <b>blade</b> gap former. It consisted of methodological development and laboratory scale studies, as well as layering studies on the pilot paper machine scale. The potential of layered structures in papermaking and the phenomena affecting layer mixing were also studied. Filler distributions were characterized by two parameters – filler distribution shape and symmetry factors. The method developed made it possible to apply a statistical approach to experiments when studying the impact of typical wet end control parameters on the control of filler distributions and the contribution of filler distributions to paper quality parameters. A method by which the center layer fiber distribution may be characterized from the final paper is also presented. The method is based on the use of dyed fibers and a spectrofotometer. In addition, a laboratory device, a multilayer handsheet former for making layered structures, is presented. The process closely resembles a real continuous multilayer process by providing water phase interactions between layers during forming and two-sided dewatering characteristics. In a case study, retention chemical and filler layering with WFC base paper was performed by the multilayer handsheet former. Surface roughness decreased and brightness increased when the filler content in paper surfaces was increased. At constant filler content, paper strength increased as the filler concentration in the paper surfaces increased. The distinction between <b>roll</b> dewatering and <b>blade</b> dewatering in terms of layer mixing as well as differences in the mixing behavior of fibers and fillers in different dewatering phases was studied. Major fiber mixing takes place during the free jet and roll dewatering phase. In blade dewatering, fiber movements are related to formation improvements. The greatest mobility differences between fibers and fillers were found in the blade dewatering phase in <b>roll</b> and <b>blade</b> dewatering. Filler distributions were significantly affected during blade dewatering, with the mobility of the fibers remaining insignificant. The relationship between typical fine paper quality parameters and filler distributions was studied. Formation improvement and densification of the paper were achievable at the same running conditions. Low porosity was achieved by evenly distributed constituents (good formation) and a local rich filler concentration somewhere in the paper structure in the paper thickness direction. Oil absorption two-sidedness was minimized by symmetrical filler distributions. The combination of all these quality factors required the filler distribution to be symmetrical and as u- or turned u-shaped as possible. The use of additives layering as a part of paper quality control was also studied. Multilayering was found to be an effective tool for the control of filler distributions. On the other hand it was shown that, in order to get optimized impact of the multilayering on quality properties, the other process variables also need to be controlled. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The analysis, {{modeling}} {{and design of}} the lift-driven Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) has challenged the wind energy community for many decades; this limited progress in knowledge has severely impaired {{the development of the}} VAWT, giving rise to the myth that the VAWT rotor is inherently inefficient (in comparison with the more conventional Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine - HAWT) or too complex for commercial implementation. In this research work, we take a new path on the analysis of the VAWT: instead of considering a rotor that creates a perturbation on the flow (wake and induction field), we consider an unsteady wake, to which a rotor energy-conversion system is associated, obtaining the loading on the blade by better understanding the flow. The research aims at understanding the wake and its relation with energy conversion and the loading on the rotor system. Four main questions drive this research:  What is the relation between blade loading and energy conversion?  How does the near wake of the VAWT develop?  What is the difference between the 2 D and the 3 D wake?  How does understanding the near wake improve our design? At the end of this dissertation we achieve a clear and insightful view on the 2 D and 3 D aerodynamics {{from the point of view}} of the wake, that significantly improves the aerodynamic design and optimization of new VAWT rotors for energy conversion and propulsion, opening a new design space and methodology. The results and discussion presented in this dissertation are organized in five steps (see thesis outline, Chapter 1) :  Part I: understand the fundamental VAWT aerodynamics and how these relate with the research presented in this dissertation.  Part II: understand the energy exchange process in the 2 D plane by understanding the shedding of the wake over the rotation, and the wake expansion in 2 D. Analyze the impact of dynamic stall on the near wake evolution, and how to extract blade load information from the near wake in dynamic stall.  Part III: understand the impact of the spanwise dimension of the rotor and the role of the consequent trailing vorticity. Investigate the little known skewed flow.  Part IV: understand better the energy exchange process, the wake’s generation and the decoupling between loading and energy conversion. Propose new approaches and guidelines for the aerodynamic rotor design.  Part V: discuss the main results and conclusions of the research, and its impact on new aerodynamic research and design approaches, both for 2 D and 3 D VAWT rotors. In Part I (Chapter 2) we frame our research approach, analyzing the VAWT from a wake perspective, by considering both 2 D and 3 D aerodynamics of the VAWT at two different scales: aerofoil/blade scale and rotor scale. We divide the rotor in windward (315 ? < ? < 45 ?), upwind (45 ?< ? < 135 ?), leeward (135 ? < ? < 225 ?) and downwind (225 ? < ? < 315 ?) regions of the rotation. This approach obsolesces the conventional division of the rotor into upwind and downwind halves; while the upwind/downwind division is driven by angle of attack considerations (blade loading problem), this new segmentation is determined by the shedding of vorticity (energy conversion problem), a more useful and effective approach. The wake is also split into shed vorticity due to the time gradient of the bound circulation, and trailing vorticity due to the spatial gradient of the bound circulation; this division leads to our 2 D and 3 D analysis of the flow. In Part II, we analyze the 2 D rotor and wake at two scales: rotor and blade. The two flow scales are obviously related, in the sense that the rotor’s aerodynamics are the result of the wakes generated at the several blades and the blade experiences an induction field due to the vorticity distributed over the wake at the rotor scale. The separation in blade and rotor scale is in fact a separation of two views on the total system:  The rotor, as an energy exchange system, where the energy exchange results in a wake and streamline expansion.  The blade, as an aerodynamic loading system, where the design-objective loading is associated with an equivalent bound circulation. The time variation of this bound circulation results in a shed wake. The 2 D potential-flow analysis (Chapter 3) shows that:  the conventional breakdown of the VAWT into upwind and downwind actuator systems is incorrect, leading to an overestimation of energy conversion on the upwind half of the rotation and an underestimation in the downwind half.  contrary to the HAWT, the induction is not a function of the total loading, but only of the load component associated with the azimuthally varying circulation.  it is possible to significantly improve Double Multiple Streamtube models by incorporating a better description of the flow. The proposed improved model clearly surpasses conventional models on the prediction of the induction and loading.  the impact of the blade bound-circulation constant-term is small in comparison to the time-varying bound-circulation term; therefore, the induction field of the 2 D VAWT in potential flow can be defined by only the number of blades, rotor solidity and tip-speed ratio. This allows for the obsolescence of streamtube momentum models, replaced by faster and more accurate potential flow vortex models. In Chapters 4 and 5 we visualize and quantify, experimentally and numerically, the flow field in the near wake of the blade during the upwind and leeward segments of the motion, at tip-speed ratios ? = 2, 3 and 4, using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). An interesting physical aspect of the vortical flow in dynamic stall, especially at low tip-speed ratios, is the transport of the shed vorticity with the blade. This transport of the vortical structures with the blade means that the geometry of the wake, due to viscous effects, differs from what is obtained with potential flow. A different spatial distribution of the shed vorticity implies a different induction field, which might imply a reduction of the effectiveness of momentum models and simple potential-flow models and change the rotor’s performance. The results show two important effects:  At the rotor scale, the transport of vorticity with the <b>blade,</b> <b>rolled</b> in the leading edge/trailing edge separated vortices.  At the blade scale, the importance of the small scale vortices for the oscillations on pressure distribution and loads. In Chapter 6 we use the experimental and numerical data from the previous chapters to evaluate the feasibility of extracting information from the flow/wake measured with PIV, even in dynamic stall, for improving flow analysis and model validation. In Part III we introduce the fourth dimension of our problem: the spanwise direction. The finite span leads to a non-constant spanwise distribution of circulation on the blade, and this distribution leads to the release of trailing vorticity, of which the blade tip vortex is the most prominent component. In Chapter 7 we measure the wake at the tip-vortex region of the VAWT; in Chapter 8 we combine these experimental results with 3 D unsteady free-wake potential-flow simulations to:  experimentally and numerically observe, quantify and analyze the generation and convection of the 3 D tip vortex of the VAWT.  experimentally, numerically and analytically investigate the effect of blade-tip shape on the generation and convection of the tip vortex, with focus on the added circulation due to the motion of the blade.  combine experimental measurements and numerical simulations to analyze: the 3 D wake of the VAWT; the interaction between shed and trailing vorticity; the roll-up and expansion of the wake in the leeward and windward regions; the in-rotor convection and inboard/outboard motion of the tip vortex; the 3 D induction field; the 3 D blade wake interaction during the downwind blade passage; and the effect of trailing vorticity in the spanwise distribution of circulation, including the 2 D to 3 D load direction reversal in the downwind blade passage. The spanwise dimension of the flow also gives rise to a new form of misalignment between the flow and the axis: skewed flow. In Chapter 9 we analyze the physics of skewed flow, flow asymmetry, near wake development, blade-wake interaction and impact on energy conversion. The analysis of the VAWT from the point of view of the 2 D and 3 D near wake is shown to be very effective in understanding: the physics of the flow; the energy exchange process; how the total energy exchange over one rotation actually relates to the local aerodynamic loading on the blade; the impact of implementing an essentially 2 D energy conversion process into a 3 D aerodynamic system; and the resulting inefficiencies due to the finite span and trailing vorticity. In Part IV (Chapter 10) we show that it is possible to decompose the VAWT design problem into designing for loading and designing for energy conversion, opening a large design space and proposing a new methodology, impacting both 2 D and 3 D flow. We also show that, although the 2 D wake does not vary significantly with variation in the pitching axis location and blade camber, the 3 D wake and performance are significantly affected by these variations. This is due to the impact that varying the bound circulation has on the release of trailing vorticity; a larger trailing vorticity generated during the upwind blade passage implies a larger induction due to trailing vorticity, and a worse interaction at the downwind blade passage. The effects of variation of camber and/or pitching axis in 2 D and 3 D performance are contradictory and complementary and can be simultaneously optimized. In Part V (Chapter 11) we further develop these and other main conclusions, discussing their impact on VAWT aerodynamics. The research here presented implies a break from conventional approaches to the VAWT aerodynamics, allowing for the development of new research and models, both in 2 D flow (aerofoil design, rotor energy conversion optimization) and 3 D flow (blade and rotor shape, non-uniform flows) ...|$|R
