It documents substantial differences in the 'popularity' of <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>dates</b> during 1989 - 2010, and an increasing preference of June year-ends in recent years. Eighty-one percent of Australian firms choose June to align with the mandatory tax period, followed by 13 % for December and 6 % for other months. The paper finds that industry membership {{plays an important role}} in the choice of fiscal year-ends, evidenced by a strong non-June effect for manufacturing, retail and financial service companies. Finally, it summarises four popular reasons for Australian firms changing fiscal year-ends, and finds that 26 % of those firms did not disclose the change via a separate announcement on the Australian Securities Exchange in a timely manner. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the extent to which <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> information affects the pricing of the common stocks of securities and financial service firms. It is well known that income statement provides important information for the valuation of common stock. However, in the case of securities and financial service companies, the holding of financial, as opposed to operating, assets and thus the <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> of securities and financial service firms may well represent the predominant repository of the information affecting the price of common stock. This paper finds that there are significant changes in stock prices of securities and financial service firms surrounding the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> disclosure <b>date</b> and that the market reactions to <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> information are stronger when there is unexpected good news than where there is unexpected bad news. In general, prices of securities firm stocks react more to changes in asset values than to changes in earnings. Furthermore, the earnings announcement tends to reinforce the effect of the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> disclosure.

40|$|Timeliness {{of annual}} reports is an {{important}} attribute of their usefulness. There is a paucity of research about the timeliness of the published audited accounts of the companies in developing countries in general and audit delays in particular. This paper empirically {{examined the relationship between}} the audit delay and several company characteristics in a developing country, Pakistan. The objectives of this study are twofold. First, to measure the extent of audit lag in a developing country, Pakistan. Second, to establish the impact of selected corporate attributes on audit delays in Pakistan. Both univariate and multivariate analyses are performed to test the hypotheses of the study. The audit delay for each of the 103 listed sample companies ranged from a minimum interval of 30 days to a maximum interval of 249 days and Pakistani listed companies take approximately five months on average beyond their <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>dates</b> before they finally ready for the presentation of the audited accounts to the shareholders at the annual general meeting. This evidence suggests that timeliness may not be an important concern for Pakistani companies in financial reporting policy. With regard to timeliness as a qualitative objective of financial statements, this evidence can be regarded as unsatisfactory. The results for the sample of 103 listed Pakistani companies showed that audit delay was significantly related to the subsidiaries of multinational companies only. Other six corporate attributes found not to be significantly associated with audit delay. 1 An Examination of Audit Delay: Evidence from Pakistan...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} how Japanese bank “performance” has improved markedly since fiscal 2003 but to caution against over-optimism. Design/methodology/approach – The methodological approach adopted involves using aggregate <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> data <b>dating</b> from around 1990 to identify the trends in industry performance with respect to profitability, asset quality and capital adequacy. Findings – The bursting of the asset price bubble in the early 1990 s clearly had a major adverse impact on “performance”, as measured by the above-mentioned indicators, but, after fiscal 1992, the industry's fortunes began to improve. Problems on each front, however, remain to be resolved. Practical implications – By identifying the main problems still besetting the Japanese banks, both the industry and their supervisors are given advice as to which areas they need to focus on to improve future bank performance. Originality/value – The paper clearly explains the nature of, and reasons for, the recent improvement in Japanese bank performance whilst highlighting the areas on which they still have to focus if they are to regain their former glory within the international banking community. It should be of interest to all serious scholars of the Japanese banking system and interested commentators alike.

Until September 2008 the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the FED did not expand strongly. However, the structure of the FED assets varied pronouncedly. Starting in September 2008 the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> expanded dramatically.

The restrictions might include legally restricted deposits, which are held as compensating balances against short-term borrowings, contacts entered into with others or entity statements of intention with regard to specific deposits; nevertheless, time deposits and short-term certificates of deposit are excluded from legally restricted deposits. Restricted cash can be also set aside for other purposes such as expansion of the entity, dividend funds or [...] "retirement of long-term debt". Depending on its immateriality or materiality, restricted cash may be recorded as [...] "cash" [...] in the financial statement or it might be classified based on the date of availability disbursements.Moreover, if cash is expected to be used within one year after the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>date</b> it can be classified as [...] "current asset", but in {{a longer period of time}} it is mentioned as non- current asset. For example, a large machine manufacturing company receives an advance payment (deposit) from its customer for a machine that should be produced and shipped to another country within 2 months. Based on the customer contract the manufacturer should put the deposit into separate bank account and not withdraw or use the money until the equipment is shipped and delivered. This is a restricted cash, since manufacturer has the deposit, but he can not use it for operations until the equipment is shipped.|$|E

40|$|A {{borrower}} has {{a long-term}} loan that requires compliance with certain covenants, such as {{maintenance of a}} minimum current ratio, minimum debt-to-equity ratio, or minimum level of shareholders ' equity. The borrower must meet the covenants on a quarterly or semiannual basis. At one of the compliance dates, the borrower violates a covenant. That violation gives the lender the right to call the debt. The lender waives that right for a period greater than one year but retains the future covenant requirements. The issue is whether the waiver of the lender's rights resulting from the violation of the covenant with the retention of the periodic covenant tests represents, in substance, a grace period. If viewed as a grace period, the borrower must classify the debt as current under Statement 78 unless {{it is probable that}} the borrower can cure the violation (comply with the covenant) within the grace period. Specifically, the balance sheet classification of an obligation under the following scenarios was questioned: 1.

40|$|In accounting, {{measurement}} is {{the process}} {{used to determine the}} value at which the items of financial statements are recognized in accounting and presented in the balance sheet and in the profit and loss account. Starting from the importance of measurement in accounting, the first study objective in this paper brings in the center of discussion the inventories measurement with the purpose to identify the main methods for inventories measurement at exit used by the economic entities listed on EuroNext Paris Exchange Stock. In the present context, when the financial crisis is still felt in the EU countries is important to note the extent to which economic entities demonstrate prudence in accounting by taking into consideration the inventories impairment at <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>date.</b> Compliance with the prudence principle to integrate uncertainty in accounting measurement has the purpose to avoid the risk to transfer in the future periods the present uncertainties that are likely to strike the economic entity. One of the main consequences of this principle is to make impairments for inventories. Therefore the second objective of the present paper is to reflect {{the extent to which the}} entities under study record impairments for inventories at <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>date,</b> as well as to highlight the manner in which is disclosed the information regarding the way the net realizable value can be calculated.
