He introduced more discipline to the company's software development, resulting in more modern software products and a greater <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> features. However, over time Reynolds would lose clients as it became more stern on pricing and long-term contracts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Breadth</b> <b>of</b> {{definition}} of a good: The broader the {{definition of}} a good (or service), the lower the elasticity. For example, Company X's fish and chips would tend to have a relatively high elasticity of demand if a significant number of substitutes are available, whereas food in general would have an extremely low elasticity of demand because no substitutes exist.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, the {{assumptions}} and theories developed by historians are not definitive, and debate still rages on many issues, {{such as the}} breeding or size of the horse, {{and a number of}} sources must be consulted {{in order to understand the}} <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> the subject.|$|E

5|$|Cott's {{textbook}} {{was at once}} well received, being admired both by zoologists and naturalists {{and among}} allied soldiers. Many officers carried {{a copy of the}} book with them in the field. Since the war it has formed the basis for experimental investigation of camouflage, while its <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> coverage and accuracy have ensured that it remains frequently cited in scientific papers.|$|E

5|$|Parts to be {{injection}} moulded {{must be very}} carefully designed to facilitate the moulding process; the material used for the part, the desired shape and features of the part, the material of the mould, and {{the properties of the}} moulding machine must all be taken into account.

5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} by Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc. as a hardcover in January 2010. It was noted as being well-researched and covering a significant <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> academic fields. However, reviews were mixed; several reviewers found that while Rifkin provided a convincing overview {{of the development of}} empathy, he did not provide sufficient proof that increased empathy would necessarily bring people together to co-operatively solve global problems.|$|E
5|$|Although Dickinson's acquaintances {{were most}} likely aware of her writing, {{it was not until}} after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, {{discovered}} her cache of poems—that the <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> her work became apparent to the public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1955, {{thousands}} of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the gulag labor camps. Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people. Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed {{to persuade him to}} make his remarks in a closed session.|$|E
5|$|The figures, the {{minutely}} detailed clothes, and {{the architecture}} of the room and windows are depicted {{with a high degree of}} realism. Van Eyck's mastery at handling oil can be seen in the differing <b>breadths</b> <b>of</b> brush strokes. The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.|$|R
40|$|Twenty accessions of Bixa orellana L.,were {{assessed}} for the genetic divergence using Mahalanobis D 2 statistics. The clustering pattern {{indicated that there}} was no association between geographical distribution of the accessions and genetic divergence. The characters namely capsule length and <b>breadth,</b> number <b>of</b> seeds/ capsule and seed bixin content of the accessions were analyzed. All these characters like capsule length and <b>breadth,</b> number <b>of</b> seeds per capsule and seed bixin content were contributing maximum to the divergence. Therefore, selection of divergent parents based on these characters is recommended for producing good hybrids...|$|R

5|$|In 1898, even {{cars and}} {{motorcycles}} {{were allowed to}} open the road for the competitors. In 1900, the race was within a hair's <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> disappearing, with only 19 riders at the start. The following year, the organisation therefore decided to allow help only from pacers on bicycles. And in 1910, help from pacers were stopped for good. An option which lifted Paris–Roubaix out of the background and pushed it, in terms of interest, ahead of the prestigious Bordeaux–Paris.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Coolbrith {{accepted}} {{the presidency of}} the Pacific Coast Woman's Press Association, and a park was dedicated to her, at 1715 Taylor Street, one block from her pre-earthquake home. Coolbrith was named honorary member of the California Writers Club around 1913, a group that quickly expanded to include Lummis and other Southern Californians. In 1913, Ella Sterling Mighels founded the California Literature Society which met informally once a month at Coolbrith's Russian Hill home, newspaper columnist and literary critic George Hamlin Fitch presiding. Mighels, who has been called California's literary historian, credited her <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> knowledge to Coolbrith and the society meetings.|$|E

The museum itself received a Finding Of No Significant Impact in March 2014. The Environmental Impact Evaluation for the footbridge, released in July 2014, analyzed seven alternatives for the footbridge location. Alternative 5a, located east of the baggage building and including a section to the garage, was the preferred alternative. The state committed $20 million towards {{the cost of the}} potential footbridge.|$|E

5|$|Michelangelo painted {{onto the}} damp plaster using a wash {{technique}} to apply broad areas of colour, {{then as the}} surface became drier, he revisited these areas with a more linear approach, adding shade and detail {{with a variety of}} brushes. For some textured surfaces, such as facial hair and woodgrain, he used a broad brush with bristles as sparse as a comb.

It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published. He began it in 77, and had not made a final revision at the time of his death during the AD79 eruption of Vesuvius.|$|E
5|$|Read-Only Memory is a British {{publisher}} of art books on topics of video game history and culture. Following {{a resurgence of}} interest in 1980s and '90s British video game development, the company crowdfunded and produced four art books: an oral history of that Britsoft era, two books on British developers Sensible Software and The Bitmap Brothers, and a definitive volume on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, for which the publisher became best known. Read-Only Memory's books are archival anthologies, including original design documents juxtaposed with developer interviews and high-quality prints of in-game graphics. Reviewers were particularly impressed with each book's <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> unreleased concepts.|$|E
