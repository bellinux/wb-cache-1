25|$|A <b>Bellini–Tosi</b> <b>{{direction}}</b> <b>finder</b> (B–T or BTDF) {{is a type}} {{of radio}} direction finder (RDF), which determines the direction to, or bearing of, a radio transmitter. Earlier RDF systems used very large rotating loop antennae, which the B–T system replaced with two fixed antennae and a small rotating loop, known as a radiogoniometer. This made RDF much more practical, especially on large vehicles like ships or when using very long wavelengths that demand large antennae.|$|E

The squadron was assigned the T3M-2 torpedo-bombers, the same type flown by VT-9S. In September, the VP-8S received the XPY-1 for service tests and development of the <b>Bellini-Tosi</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b>|$|E

50|$|A key {{improvement}} in the RDF concept was introduced by Ettore Bellini and Alessandro Tosi in 1909 (U.S. Patent 943,960). Their system used two such antennas, typically triangular loops, arranged at right angles. The signals from the antennas were sent into coils wrapped around a wooden frame {{about the size of}} a pop can, where the signals were re-created in the area between the coils. A separate loop antenna located in this area could then be used to hunt for the direction, without moving the main antennas. This made RDF so much more practical that it was soon being used for navigation on a wide scale, often as the first form of aerial navigation available, with ground stations homing in on the aircraft's radio set. <b>Bellini-Tosi</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> were widespread from the 1920s into the 1950s.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of microwave <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> which operate under a variety of conditions and signal environments, but they can be divided into two major classes: (a) scanning, and (b) non-scanning. This paper discusses non-scanning multichannel amplitude-comparison systems, and in particular, systems using wide band antennas with crystal-video receivers to indicate the bearing of pulsed signals instantaneously. The accuracy of this type of <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> can be improved by increasing the number of channels. The characteristics of <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> in which there are more channels in the radio-frequency portion of the system than in the video portion were studied with an analogue of a <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> The results of the analogue studies were applied in the development of an improved microwave antenna system for a tactical <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> The construction and performance of this antenna system are discussed.

50|$|The <b>Bellini-Tosi</b> <b>{{direction}}</b> <b>finder</b> was a type {{of radio}} direction finder that was widely used from World War I to World War II. It used the signals from two crossed antennas, or four individual antennas simulating two crossed ones, to re-create the radio signal in a small area between two loops of wire. The operator could then measure the angle to the target radio source by performing direction finding within this small area. The advantage to the Bellini-Tosi system is that the antennas do not move, allowing them to be built at any required size.|$|E
5000|$|In 1907 an {{improvement}} {{was introduced by}} Ettore Bellini and Alessandro Tosi that greatly simplified the DF system in some setups. The single loop antenna was replaced by two antennas, arranged at right angles. The output of each was sent to its own looped wire, or as they are referred to in this system, a [...] "field coil". Two such coils, one for each antenna, are arranged close together at right angles. The signals from the two antennas generated a magnetic field {{in the space between}} the coils, which was picked up by a rotating solenoid, the [...] "search coil". The maximum signal was generated when the search coil was aligned with the magnetic field from the field coils, which was at the angle of the signal in relation to the antennas. This eliminated any need for the antennas to move. The <b>Bellini-Tosi</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (B-T) was widely used on ships, although mechanical systems tended to be used on aircraft as they were normally smaller.|$|E
