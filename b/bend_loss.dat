40|$|An {{investigation}} of temperature-induced instabilities in a wavelength measurement {{system based on}} macro-bend fiber filter used in the ratiometric scheme are presented. Two wavelength measurement systems based on macro-bend fiber, a standard low <b>bend</b> <b>loss</b> single-mode fiber filter based system and a high <b>bend</b> <b>loss</b> fiber filter based system are considered. In {{the case of a}} low <b>bend</b> <b>loss</b> fiber filter based system, the oscillatory variation in the ratio response with temperature and the difference in the temperature-induced ratio variation at different wavelengths makes the temperature corrected calibration of the system unfeasible, which is essential for precise wavelength measurements. The high <b>bend</b> <b>loss</b> fiber filter based system is more sensitive to temperature than the low <b>bend</b> <b>loss</b> fiber filter based system, but critically for the high <b>bend</b> <b>loss</b> fiber filter based system the ratio has a linear variation with temperature, which can be corrected by a suitable temperature calibration process.

40|$|An {{optical fiber}} with weak mode {{coupling}} is desirable for future ultrahigh capacity space-division multiplexing (SDM) systems because mode coupling in an optical fiber results in extrinsic {{loss of the}} fiber and crosstalk between guided optical modes. To study the feasibility of a ring-core fiber (RCF) for SDM systems, in this paper, we investigate the mode coupling in the RCF supporting five or seven guided mode groups (MGs) at a wavelength of 1550 nm. For this purpose, the coupled mode/power theory with identified spatial power spectrum of random perturbations of fiber axis is used to estimate the bend loss/crosstalk of the RCF due to microbending.
