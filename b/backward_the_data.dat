40|$|Some new {{experimental}} data {{are discussed in}} the framework of a previously proposed model with one single Regge pole. These data show that as opposed to the forward case, <b>the</b> <b>backward</b> elastic scattering depends critically on the microscopic properties of the projectile and the target nucleus. Our model reproduces perfectly the results obtained by Van Oers et al. for α- 16 O; for α- 12 C scattering in the 20 - 23 MeV region, a normalization factor must be introduced {{to take care of the}} considerable amount of absorption in the states which give most of <b>the</b> <b>backward</b> contribution. <b>The</b> physical interpretation of the pole as a temporary rotator with a very short lifetime leads to dimensions compatible with the basic hypotheses of the model. On comparing the one-pole formulae for the spin 0 spin 0 and spin 0 spin 1 2 cases, a striking qualitative difference is found in the large angle elastic scattering, heavy oscillations in the first case and no oscillations in the second. Both show however a large peak in <b>the</b> extreme <b>backward</b> scattering. <b>The</b> present <b>data</b> for α- 31 P confirm this prediction.

To assess potential adverse effects of past exposure, we compared three different <b>backward</b> extrapolation models. <b>The</b> <b>data</b> originated from OC determinations in a cohort of anglers and their families. Repeated PCB measurements collected in the 1970 s, 1980 s, and 1990 s were used when testing <b>the</b> <b>backward</b> extrapolations. We applied a simple and a complex decay model based on assumptions used in previous studies; a third was a regression model incorporating markers of OC intake and loss. These techniques provided past exposure estimates. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated comparing measured and estimated PCB values. ICC values for the regression model equations were 0. 77 and 0. 89; ICC values for the simple and complex decay models were significantly lower, with ranges of 0. 07 – 0. 45 and – 0. 14 – 0. 69, respectively. Plots showing trends of OC concentrations in fish and humans indicate comparable increases and decreases of PCB in fish and humans, with fish concentrations peaking approximately 10 years before that in humans. Our findings suggest that one should be cautious when using simple backward extrapolation techniques to estimate OC exposure in situations involving changing environmental exposures.
