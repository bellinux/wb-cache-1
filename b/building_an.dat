5|$|A major {{crisis for}} the {{plutonium}} program occurred in July 1943, when Emilio Segrè's group confirmed that plutonium {{created in the}} X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge contained high levels of plutonium-240. Its spontaneous fission ruled out the use of plutonium in a gun-type nuclear weapon. Oppenheimer's Los Alamos Laboratory met the challenge by designing and <b>building</b> <b>an</b> implosion-type nuclear weapon.|$|E
5|$|Amy is a playable {{character}} in Sonic Advance 1, 2 and 3, platformers for the Game Boy Advance. With Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and (in the latter 2 games) Cream, she frees animals from inside Eggman's robots {{to keep him}} from <b>building</b> <b>an</b> empire. Although in Sonic Advance Amy's attacking power was restricted by her inability to spin while jumping (unlike those of the other characters), this was changed in the latter two games.|$|E
5|$|During {{the episode}} Jack Donaghy {{inherits}} Argus, Don Geiss's beloved pet peacock. Throughout the episode, Argus {{can be seen}} at Jack's office in the 30 Rock <b>building.</b> <b>An</b> actual peacock was featured here. In one scene, Liz Lemon sees Argus and is frightened of him. While talking to Jack, Argus hits Liz across the face with his feathers, thus marking her as his mate. To accommodate this, puppeteers—Peter Linz, Noel MacNeal, and Carmen Osbahr—were brought in to hit Liz in the face with feathers instead of using the peacock itself.|$|E

5|$|Five Points {{is a small}} {{commercial}} district {{centered on}} and around the five-way intersection between Park, Lomax, and Margaret Streets. The area was originally residential, but transitioned to commercial uses after World War I and several retail buildings were constructed. The Park Arcade <b>Building,</b> <b>an</b> Italian Renaissance revival structure with storefronts marked by variant rooflines, set the architectural tone for the district when it was completed in 1928. Other notable features include Sun-Ray Cinema, formerly Riverside Theater, which opened in 1927 as the first movie theater in Florida equipped to show talking pictures. Over the last several decades, Five Points has become known for its edgy, bohemian character and many independent shops, restaurants and businesses.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{structure}} {{was used by}} and for student organizations. Formerly housed in the Calisthenium and Riding Academy and later the Alumnae Gymnasium, the Philaletheis Society moved into the Students' Building upon its opening and began to use the space for its theatrical performances. The junior prom, lectures from {{a wide array of}} speakers, and faculty-led skits all took place beneath the building's roof. Vassar's yearbook, the Vassarion, as well as its weekly newspaper, The Miscellany News, were also headquartered in the Students' <b>Building.</b> <b>An</b> annual Christmas party, complete with students clad as reindeer pulling a sled on which sat political science professor Charles Gordon Post dressed as Santa Claus, once occurred within the building as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1664 {{the mill}} {{partially}} burned down. It was rebuilt and, {{in order to}} recover from the losses, the miller did not have to pay taxes for the next 15 years. In 1764 another fire destroyed the entire mill, according to an ordenance from the States General after the miller requested assistance. The mill was rebuilt {{with the addition of a}} second water wheel. The larger building was a gristmill and the smaller <b>building</b> <b>an</b> oil mill. In 1909 a sawmill was added to the larger building, and for a period the smaller building also acted as a fulling mill.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, {{he founded}} {{a mission to}} work with the Asháninka due to {{deforestation}} caused by settlers. He maintained the Cutivereni (alternate spelling Cutivireni) mission of the Ene River parish in the Peruvian Amazon, southeast of Satipo. Cutivereni was a hub for 5,000 Asháninkas who lived in the area. The mission, located at the confluence of three rivers, had 91 buildings and housed 700 people. The mission was equipped with a plaza, a chapel, a generator <b>building,</b> <b>an</b> infirmary, a bilingual school, workshops, and a landing strip. The Asháninka hunted, and farmed manioc other foods. They also grew cocao, a cash-crop.|$|E
5|$|In July 1944, Oppenheimer reorganized the {{laboratory}} {{to focus on}} the problem of <b>building</b> <b>an</b> implosion-type nuclear weapon, which was necessary because the gun-type design would not work with plutonium. P Division was broken up, and Bacher became the head of the G (for Gadget) Division. This much larger division contained eleven groups headed by leaders who included William Higinbotham, Seth Neddermeyer, Edwin McMillan, Luis Alvarez and Otto Frisch.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} this geopolitical perspective, Pablo {{argued that the}} only way the Trotskyists could avoid {{isolation}} was for various sections of the Fourth International to undertake long-term entryism in the mass Communist or Social Democratic parties. This tactic was known as entrism sui generis, to distinguish it from the short-term entry tactic employed before World War II. For example, it meant that the project of <b>building</b> <b>an</b> open and independent Trotskyist party was shelved in France, because it was regarded as not politically feasible alongside entry into the French Communist Party.|$|E

5|$|Internally, Salvin knocked through {{existing}} {{rooms to}} create the Outer Hall, a new gallery on the first floor, a billiard room, a new library and a drawing room. Much of the wooden 17th-century panelling in the parlour and the hall had to be stripped out {{as part of the}} renovations. As part of his work, Salvin appears to have used a number of rolled wrought-iron beams to span the resulting structural gaps in the <b>building,</b> <b>an</b> advanced use of that technology for the time. The house was refurnished with newly bought 16th and 17th-century artwork, two brass Italian cannons and a stuffed polar bear.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale {{construction}} of airports in Norway {{started in the}} 1950s, largely funded by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Bergen Airport, Flesland opened in 1955, followed by Ålesund Airport, Vigra in 1958. The first plans for an airport in Sunnfjord were launched by Engineer Arne Bengtsen, who proposed <b>building</b> <b>an</b> airfield in Florø and having Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap operate to it using the Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer. Construction started in 1956, but was halted after the airline could not guarantee operations during winter.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of <b>building</b> <b>an</b> atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, the school added several new <b>buildings.</b> <b>A</b> two {{classroom}} kindergarten <b>building,</b> <b>a</b> multi-purpose <b>building,</b> and <b>a</b> new office <b>building.</b> The buildings are prefabricated purpose built buildings, rather than the 'portables' that are in use in many schools in the US.|$|R

5|$|Plans for {{the road}} {{go back to the}} 1930s, when a parkway was {{proposed}} between Camden and Atlantic City that was never built. Plans resurfaced {{for the road}} in the 1950s when a group of officials led by State Senator Frank S. Farley pushed for a road to help the area economy. The New Jersey Expressway Authority was created in 1962 to be responsible for <b>building</b> <b>an</b> expressway. The Atlantic City Expressway was built between 1962 and 1965 at a total cost of $48.2 million. The South Jersey Transportation Authority assumed control of the road in 1991 from the New Jersey Expressway Authority.|$|E

5|$|Roosevelt {{decided that}} the letter {{required}} action, and authorized {{the creation of the}} Advisory Committee on Uranium. The committee was chaired by Lyman James Briggs, the Director of the Bureau of Standards (currently the National Institute of Standards and Technology), with Adamson and Hoover as its other members. It convened {{for the first time on}} October 21. The meeting was also attended by Fred L. Mohler from the Bureau of Standards, Richard B. Roberts of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and Szilárd, Teller and Wigner. Adamson was skeptical about the prospect of <b>building</b> <b>an</b> atomic bomb, but was willing to authorize $6,000 ($100,000 in current USD) for the purchase of uranium and graphite for Szilárd and Fermi's experiment.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was {{to decide on the}} feasibility of <b>building</b> <b>an</b> ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E
