5|$|Psilocybin is a {{tryptamine}} compound with {{a chemical}} structure containing an indole ring {{linked to an}} ethylamine substituent. It is chemically related to the amino acid tryptophan, and is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter serotonin. Psilocybin {{is a member of}} the general class of tryptophan-based compounds that originally functioned as antioxidants in earlier life forms before assuming more complex functions in multicellular organisms, including humans. Other related indole-containing psychedelic compounds include dimethyltryptamine, found in many plant species and in trace amounts in some mammals, and <b>bufotenine,</b> found in the skin of psychoactive toads.|$|E
25|$|Bufotenin {{was first}} {{isolated}} from toad skin, and {{named by the}} Austrian chemist Handovsky at the University of Prague during World War I. The structure of <b>bufotenine</b> was first confirmed in 1934 by Heinrich Wieland’s laboratory in Munich, and the first reported synthesis of <b>bufotenine</b> was by Toshio Hoshino and Kenya Shimodaira in 1935.|$|E
25|$|Bufotenin (<b>bufotenine)</b> is {{also known}} by the {{chemical}} names 5-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-HO-DMT), N,N-dimethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, dimethyl serotonin, and mappine.|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} communications (1 - 12), we {{have presented}} data, both chemical and pharmacological, on the active principles isolated from Ch’an Su and the “parotid ” secretion {{of each of}} 12 different species of toads. Generally speaking, there is a resemblance in the results from one species to another, {{but there are certain}} differences that can be detected by scrupulous exam-ination of the detailed records. We have already indicated in our preliminary reports (13, 14) that the respective bufagins, bufo-toxins, and <b>bufotenines</b> are not all identical with one another. The present paper deals with the strict comparison of bufagins, bufotoxins, and a few members of the digitalis series, and it con-stitutes a r#{ 233 }sum#{ 233 }of our findings concerning both animal and plant products which have a specific action on the heart. It may be repeated here that the terms bufagins and bufotoxins are employed generically. For each specific principle is prefixed the name of the species, or some reference to the place where the toad is found. The glucosides that were selected as representatives of the digi-talis series consisted of digitoxin, G-strophanthin or ouabain, scillarens A and B, and thevetin-the last being one of the gluco-sides recently isolated by ourselves from the be-still nuts or, botani-cally, Thevetia neriifolia (15). Both scillarens A and B were generously supplied by Professor R. L. Stehle of McGill Univer-sity, Montreal, to whom we feel deeply indebted. Digitoxin and G-strophanthin, both crystalline, were obtained from commercial sources. EVIDENCE OF SIMILARITY 1. Solubility. All the respective bufagins and bufotoxins have approximately the same solubility. Pure bufagins are soluble in 561 at...|$|R
25|$|A 1985 {{study by}} McLeod and Sitaram in humans {{reported}} that <b>bufotenine</b> administered intranasally at {{a dose of}} 1–16mg had no effect, other than intense local irritation. When given intravenously at low doses (2–4mg), <b>bufotenine</b> oxalate caused anxiety but no other effects; however, a dose of 8mg resulted in profound emotional and perceptual changes, involving extreme anxiety, a sense of imminent death, and visual disturbance associated with color reversal and distortion, and intense flushing of the cheeks and forehead.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bufotenine</b> (DEA Drug Code 7403) is {{regulated}} as a Schedule I drug by the Drug Enforcement Administration {{at the federal}} level in the United States and is therefore illegal to buy, possess, and sell.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>bufotenine,</b> Bufo venoms also contain digoxin-like cardiac glycosides, and ingestion of the venom can be fatal. Ingestion of Bufo toad venom and eggs by humans {{has resulted in}} several reported cases of poisoning, some of which resulted in death.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Dr. Harris Isbell at the Public Health Service Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky {{experimented with}} <b>bufotenine</b> as a snuff. He {{reported}} “no subjective or objective effects were observed after spraying {{with as much}} as 40 mg bufotenine”; however subjects who received 10–12mg injected intramuscularly reported “elements of visual hallucinations consisting of a play of colors, lights, and patterns”.|$|E
25|$|In rats, subcutaneously {{administered}} bufotenin (1–100 μg/kg) distributes {{mainly to}} the lungs, heart, and blood, and to a much lesser extent, the brain (hypothalamus, brain stem, striatum, and cerebral cortex) and liver. It reaches peak concentrations at 1 hour and is nearly completely eliminated within 8 hours. In humans, intravenous administration of bufotenin results in excretion of (70%) of injected drug {{in the form of}} 5-HIAA, an endogenous metabolite of serotonin, while roughly 4% is eliminated unmetabolized in the urine. Orally administered <b>bufotenine</b> undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by the enzyme monoamine oxidase.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{ethnobotanist}} Jonathan Ott {{published the}} results [...] {{of a study}} in which he self-administered free base <b>bufotenine</b> via insufflation (5–100mg), sublingually (50mg), intrarectally (30mg), orally (100mg) and via vaporization (2–8mg). Ott reported “visionary effects" [...] of intranasal <b>bufotenine</b> and that the [...] "visionary threshold dose" [...] by this route was 40mg, with smaller doses eliciting perceptibly psychoactive effects.

2500|$|Free base bufotenin taken sublingually {{was found}} to be {{identical}} to intranasal use. The potency, duration, and psychedelic action was the same.

5000|$|At 100 mg, effects began within 5 minutes, {{peaked at}} 35-40 minutes, and lasted up to 90 minutes.

50|$|It is a {{synthetic}} drug {{belonging to the}} triptan class. Structurally, it is an analog of the naturally occurring neuro-active alkaloids dimethyltryptamine (DMT), <b>bufotenine,</b> and 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine, with an N-methyl sulfonamidomethyl- group at position C-5 on the indole ring.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and amine, whereas its two {{products are}} S-adenosylhomocysteine and methylated amine.

5000|$|Starting in 1956, Isbell and {{associates}} published studies on LSD, psilocybin, psilocin, DMT, <b>bufotenine,</b> morning glory seeds (ololiuqui),and mescaline; these substances were sometimes described as [...] "psychotomimetic". LSD and psilocybin {{for many of}} the experiments was supplied by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (both of these substances were legal at the time).

50|$|The dried rhizome {{with the}} stem removed {{has been found}} to contain 0.0057% DMT, 0.026% <b>bufotenine,</b> 0.0023% 5-MeO-MMT. The flowers are also known to have DMT and the 5-methoxylated N-demethylated analogue, also 5-MeO-NMT.

5000|$|... 5-HO-DiPT (5-hydroxy-N,N-di-iso-propyl{{tryptamine}}) is a tryptamine derivative {{which acts}} as a serotonin receptor agonist. It is primarily known as a metabolite of the better known psychoactive drug 5-MeO-DiPT, but 5-HO-DiPT has also rarely been encountered as a designer drug in its own right. Tests in vitro show 5-HO-DiPT to have high 5-HT2A affinity and good selectivity over 5-HT1A, while being more lipophilic than the related drug <b>bufotenine</b> (5-HO-DMT), which produces mainly peripheral effects.|$|E
