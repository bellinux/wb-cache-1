He was the son of the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias, the daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus. Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander.|$|E

She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen, the assistant manager of the whaling station, and Klara Olette Jacobsen. Jacobsen arrived on the island in 1904 and became the manager of Grytviken, serving from 1914 to 1921; two of his children were <b>born</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island.|$|E
5|$|A girl born at {{the station}} in 1924 was the first baby to be <b>born</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Underground network. The Bakerloo line {{building}} remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The Northern line building was designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis, and was rebuilt several times until the current structure opened in 2003. Transport for London (TfL) is currently planning a major upgrade to the station. A Bakerloo line extension south to Camberwell was planned and approved in 1931 but construction never started. Similar proposals have been revived on several occasions; in 2014 TfL ran a consultation on an extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction, which is still under consideration.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Gordon Pym was <b>born</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{island of}} Nantucket, {{famous for its}} fishing harbor and whaling. His best friend, Augustus Barnard, {{is the son of}} the captain of a whaling ship. One night, the two boys become drunk and decide, on Augustus's whim, to take {{advantage}} of the breeze and sail out on Pym's sailboat, the Ariel. The breeze, however, turns out to be the beginnings of a violent storm. The situation gets critical when Augustus passes out drunk, and the inexperienced Pym must take control of the dinghy. The Ariel is overtaken by the Penguin, a returning whaling ship. Against the captain's wishes, the crew of the Penguin turns back to search for and rescue both Augustus and Pym. After they are safely back on land, they decide to keep this episode a secret from their parents.|$|E

5|$|Del Valle {{was born}} on August 28, 1893 in San Juan, Puerto Rico when the island was still under Spanish colonial rule. He was related to Dr. Francisco del Valle, a surgeon who had served as mayor of San Juan from 1907 to 1910. In 1900, {{two years after the}} Spanish–American War, the del Valle family moved to Maryland where they became U.S. {{citizens}} (The Jones Act of 1917 later gave United States Citizenship to all Puerto Ricans <b>born</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island).

5|$|Emilio Marcos Palma was {{the first}} person born south of the 60th {{parallel}} south (the continental limit according to the Antarctic Treaty), as well as the first one <b>born</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Antarctic mainland, in 1978 at Base Esperanza, on the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula; his parents were sent there along with seven other families by the Argentine government to determine if the continent was suitable for family life. In 1984, Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Frei Montalva Station, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station. As of 2009, eleven children were born in Antarctica (south of the 60th parallel south): eight at the Argentine Esperanza Base and three at the Chilean Frei Montalva Station.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, {{the arsenal}} was renamed Little Rock Barracks {{and the main}} {{building}} used as married officers' quarters. The building was drastically altered the inside and outside. Prior to renovation, a rear basement door provided the only entrance, while the tower served as a hoist to move munitions between floors. By 1868, front and rear porches had {{been added to the}} building, as well as interior walls and stairs, some of which remain today, including the central staircase. In 1880, Douglas MacArthur was <b>born</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northwest upper floor of this building while his father, U.S. Army Captain Arthur MacArthur, was stationed there.|$|E

5|$|Many Greek Orthodox populations, {{particularly}} {{those outside the}} newly independent modern Greek state, continued to refer to themselves as Romioi (i.e. Romans, Byzantines) well into the 20th century. Peter Charanis, <b>born</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island of Lemnos in 1908 and later became a professor of Byzantine history at Rutgers University, recounts that when the island {{was taken from the}} Ottomans by Greece in 1912, Greek soldiers were sent to each village and stationed themselves in the public squares. Some of the island children ran to see what Greek soldiers looked like. ‘‘What are you looking at?’’ one of the soldiers asked. ‘‘At Hellenes,’’ the children replied. ‘‘Are you not Hellenes yourselves?’’ the soldier retorted. ‘‘No, we are Romans,’’ the children replied.|$|E
5|$|Pat Morton {{was born}} on 28 October 1910 in Lismore, New South Wales, the son of Arthur Richmond Morton and Maria Morton.

Morton's grandfather, Henry Gordon Morton, born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1828, arrived in Australia in 1852 and was a surveyor for the Berry Estate and the first Mayor of Numbaa, the private town founded by Alexander Berry.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota {{has also}} {{produced}} several notable artists. Harvey Dunn {{grew up on}} a homestead near Manchester in the late 19th century. While Dunn worked most of his career as a commercial illustrator, his most famous works showed various scenes of frontier life; he completed these {{near the end of his}} career. Oscar Howe (Crow) was <b>born</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Crow Creek Indian Reservation and won fame for his watercolor paintings. Howe was one of the first Native American painters to adopt techniques and style heavily influenced by the mid-20th century abstraction movement, rather than relying on traditional Native American styles. Terry Redlin, originally from Watertown, is an accomplished painter of rural and wildlife scenes. Many of his works are on display at the Redlin Art Center in Watertown.|$|E
5|$|Ahmad ibn Tulun was <b>born</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 23rd day of {{the month}} of Ramadan 220 AH (20 September 835) or {{slightly}} later, probably in Baghdad. His father, Tulun, was a Turk from a locality known in Arabic sources as Tagharghar or Toghuzghuz, i.e. the Uyghur confederation. In the year 815/6 (200 AH) Tulun was taken captive along with other Turks, and sent {{as part of the}} tribute of the Samanid governor of Bukhara Nuh ibn Asad to the Caliph al-Ma'mun (reigned 813–833), who at the time resided in Khurasan. After al-Ma'mun returned to Baghdad in 819, these Turkish slaves were formed into a guard corps of slave soldiers (ghilmān, sing. ghulām) entrusted to al-Ma'mun's brother and eventual successor, al-Mu'tasim (r. 833–842). Tulun did well for himself, eventually coming to command the Caliph's private guard. Ahmad's mother, called Qasim, was one of his father's slaves. In 854/5, Tulun died, and Qasim is commonly held to have married a second time, to the Turkish general Bayakbak or Bakbak. This report, however, does not appear in Ibn al-Daya or al-Balawi, and may be spurious. According to al-Balawi, after his father's death Ahmad came under the tutelage of Yalbakh, a close companion of Tulun, who had been taken captive alongside him. At his deathbed, Tulun urged his friend {{to take care of his}} wife and son, and Bakbak thereafter treated the young Ahmad as his own son.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to correct for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person <b>born</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E
