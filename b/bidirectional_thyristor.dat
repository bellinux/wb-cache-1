50|$|A {{thyristor}} {{switched capacitor}} (TSC) {{is a type}} of equipment used for compensating reactive power in electrical power systems. It consists of a power capacitor connected in series with a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>thyristor</b> valve and, usually, a current limiting reactor (inductor). The thyristor switched capacitor is an important component of a Static VAR Compensator (SVC), where it is often used in conjunction with a thyristor controlled reactor (TCR). Static VAR compensators are a member of the Flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) family.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Bidirectional</b> Control <b>Thyristor</b> (BCT) is a {{new concept}} for high power {{thyristors}} integrated on a single silicon wafer with separate gate contacts. This unique design, based on free-floating silicon technology, successfully overcomes the traditional problems of interference experienced by <b>bidirectional</b> <b>thyristors</b> during dynamic operation which previously prevented {{the use of such}} devices. Such components are suitable for applications at high voltages like a normal thyristor but where triacs can no longer be used. This new product continues the trend of power integration. A reduced component count results in lower cost and increased reliability. The following contribution refers to a family of 96 mm diameter wafer devices in 35 mm high housings rated between 2. 8 and 6. 5 kV. The BCT allows system cost reductions of up to 30 % to be reached in such installations as SVCs, cyclo-converters, transformer tap changers, soft starters and 4 Q-DC drives. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{photoinduced}} {{electrical conductivity}} switching is {{observed in the}} molecular conductor of -[bis(ethylenedithio) tetrathiafulvalene] 2 I 3 at different temperatures with different irradiation light intensities. The threshold voltage for the differential-negative-resistance effect appearing in the current-voltage characteristic curve decreases and increases, respectively, as the light intensity is increased and as the temperature decreases below the insulator-metal phase transition. The potential application of molecular conductor in <b>bidirectional</b> light-activated <b>thyristor</b> devices is demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|In an {{electric}} power transmission system, a thyristor-controlled reactor (TCR) is a reactance connected in series with a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>thyristor</b> valve. The thyristor valve is phase-controlled, which allows the value of delivered reactive power to be adjusted to meet varying system conditions. Thyristor-controlled reactors {{can be used for}} limiting voltage rises on lightly loaded transmission lines. Another device which used to be used for this purpose is a magnetically controlled reactor (MCR), a type of magnetic amplifier otherwise known as a transductor.|$|E
40|$|In {{the grid}} {{operation}} voltage fluctuations and short circuit {{are two major}} problems. In this paper a new concept for controlling the grid using combined operation of fault current limiter and Dynamic Voltage Restorer is proposed. By using this topology solution for above two fault is achieved by a single device namely FCL-DVR. Short circuit fault is detected by sensing the load current and its rate of change. The voltage fluctuation is detected by measured change in voltage. In {{order to protect the}} grid from blackout and the sensitive equipment from damages, FCL-DVR serves in efficient way. The life and quality of the equipment is improved. Combined operation of FCL-DVR is performed by a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>thyristor</b> switches in the output terminal. Switches are activated under fault condition and de-activated under normal condition. The model of a three phase grid system with different fault condition is simulated using MATLAB SIMULINK software...|$|E
50|$|TRIAC, from triode for {{alternating}} current, is {{a generic}} trademark for a three terminal electronic component that conducts current {{in either direction}} when triggered. Its formal name is <b>bidirectional</b> triode <b>thyristor</b> or bilateral triode thyristor. A thyristor is analogous to a relay in that a small voltage and current can control a much larger voltage and current. The illustration on the right shows the circuit symbol for a TRIAC where A1 is Anode 1, A2 is Anode 2, and G is Gate. Anode 1 and Anode 2 are normally termed Main Terminal 1 (MT1) and Main Terminal 2 (MT2) respectively.|$|R
