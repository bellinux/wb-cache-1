40|$|ABSTRACT. The grey <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> Deroceras reticulatum {{has become}} a pest in no tillage {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) crops in the southeast of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) are {{an important component of}} the arthropod community in agricultural systems and have the potential to reduce pest populations. We tested the predation capacity of the carabid beetle Scarites anthracinus on Deroceras reticulatum individuals of different body mass (10, 20 and 30 mg) and on their eggs, in a controlled laboratory no-choice assay. We also tested its preference for juvenile slugs and the similarly-sized pillbugs (Armadillidium vulgare), under choice conditions. This beetle preyed upon both eggs and juvenile slugs, with the highest consumption rate on 20 mg body mass individuals. While preferring the pillbug during the first 24 h of the choice test, our results suggest that in field conditions, S. anthracinus might be a natural enemy of D. reticulatum, consuming slug eggs and juveniles of different body mass.

40|$|Insects fed to captive {{insectivores}} are {{deficient in}} calcium with inverse calcium to phosphorous ratios (Ca:P), and supplementation {{is required to}} avoid nutritional metabolic bone disease (NMBD). One method of improving the nutritional value of feeder insects is by “dusting” with powdered supplements, although it is often suggested that these are rapidly shed from prey insects. Here we analysed the calcium content of hatchling, second, fourth and adult instars of <b>black</b> <b>field</b> crickets and silent crickets at increasing time intervals after dusting, as well as comparing three commercially available brands of supplement in fourth instar <b>black</b> <b>field</b> crickets. Our data show these brands do not differ from one another in terms of calcium delivery, despite differences in calcium content. We also show that dusting {{can be used to}} increase Ca:P ratios above 1 : 1 in crickets up to 5. 5 hours after dusting, with the exception of adult <b>black</b> <b>field</b> crickets, and thus dusting is a useful method of calcium supplementation...|$|R
