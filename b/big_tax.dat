Argentina’s experience has been cited as an example of the failure of free markets and fixed exchange rates, among other things. The evidence does not support those views.

Three <b>big</b> <b>tax</b> increases in 2000 - 2001 discouraged growth, and meddling with the monetary system in mid 2001 created fear of currency devaluation.
