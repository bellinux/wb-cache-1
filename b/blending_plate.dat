The process involved cross-linking of the cellulosic material with amino/amide/imide containing compounds; cyclic and acyclic. The {{structures of the}} prepared materials were identified using FTIR and solid state 13 CNMR.

40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{the optical}} methods for {{deformation}} measurement are gaining {{more and more}} applications from the aspect of solution of problems relating to elasticity and strength. The advantage of such methods {{is based on the}} measurement of non-destructive way without assembly of measuring elements regarding to the critical areas of structures. One of these contactless measuring methods is Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry ESPI that is based on the discovery of so-called speckle patterns. Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry is an optical full-field measurement method for determination of deformations of object surfaces with sensitivity below fractions of the wavelength of light. A back scattered object beam of an object surface and a reference beam, originating from the same laser light source, are superimposed on a video camera and interfere to a speckle pattern. Speckle pattern is based on the record before and after deformation of the object yield to a non-unique fringe pattern. Using a phase shifting method, this non-uniqueness can be solved and the fringe pattern can be evaluated using a computer algorithm. In this study, experimental investigation of vibration behaviour of square rubber <b>blends</b> <b>plates</b> by electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) is employed. Resonant frequencies and corresponding mode shape are obtained experimentally using the introduced method. Frequencies of resonant vibrational modes depend on elastic properties of material, especially on Young modulus E, Poisson ratio μ and density of material ρ. This fact gives us, in principle, the possibility to estimate the elastic constant of materials from the vibrational measurement. The numerical calculations by the finite element method (Cosmos) are performed and the results are compared to the experimental measurements...|$|R

40|$|A {{pilot scale}} study of three {{refining}} strategies for blended hardwood and softwood papermaking furnishes is presented. The classical, and widely employed, strategies of separate and co-refining are {{compared with a}} refining strategy in which one component is separately refined prior to blending with the other component and co-refining. The {{results show that the}} pre-refining strategy presents opportunities for improved strength development at lower levels of energy consumption. In particular, pre-refining a hardwood pulp with fine-barred <b>plates,</b> followed by <b>blending</b> with softwood pulp and co-refining the <b>blend</b> with coarse-barred <b>plates,</b> yields significant tensile strength increases without compromising density and tear properties, when compared to a blend of separately and co-refined fibres at the same net energy...|$|R
40|$|Atomic force microscopies {{were used}} to quantitatively study and map the surface elastic {{properties}} of polymers and polypropylene/ethylene-propylene copolymer blends (PP/EP). Force curve and force modulation measurements were realized on polymers with moduli ranging from 10 to 3000 MPa. Both types of measurements enable us to classify polymers {{as a function of}} their rigidity. For rigid polymers, the results are in quantitative agreement with the predictions of a simple elastic model. The influence of a thin polymer layer on the surface elastic properties was also investigated. Force modulation responses are influenced by the subsurface elastic properties down to depths that may reach hundreds of nanometres. Force modulation microscopy was performed on the surface of physical <b>blend</b> compression-moulded <b>plates</b> and of 'reactor blend' injection-moulded plates. Images reveal soft regions embedded in a rigid matrix. For the physical blend, the force modulation measurements indicate that the rigidity on the EP nodules is close to that measured on pure EP, suggesting that the nodules are present at the outermost surface. Conversely, for the 'reactor blend', the EP nodules have an intermediary rigidity between those measured on bulk EP nodules and on pure PP, suggesting that EP nodules are under a skin of PP...|$|R
40|$|The Digital Access to a Sky Century@Harvard (DASCH) {{project is}} {{digitizing}} the ~ 500, 000 glass plate images obtained (full sky) by the Harvard College Observatory from 1885 - 1992. Astrometry and photometry for each resolved object are derived with photometric rms values of ~ 0. 15 mag {{for the initial}} photometry analysis pipeline. Here we describe new developments for DASCH photometry, applied to the Kepler field, that has yielded further improvements, including better identification of image <b>blends</b> and <b>plate</b> defects by measuring image profiles and astrometric deviations. A local calibration procedure using nearby stars in a similar magnitude range as the program star (similar {{to what has been}} done for visual photometry from the plates) yields additional improvement for a net photometric rms ~ 0. 1 mag. We also describe statistical measures of light curves that are now used in the DASCH pipeline processing to autonomously identify new variables. The DASCH photometry methods described here are used in the pipeline processing for the Data Releases of DASCH data (Grindlay et al. 2012; [URL] {{as well as for the}} long-term variables discovered by DASCH in the Kepler field (Tang et al, in preparation).

40|$|Polypropylene (PP) and polypropylene/(ethylene-propylene) {{copolymer}} (EP) <b>blend</b> (PP/EP) injection-moulded <b>plates</b> {{were painted}} with a chlorinated polypropylene (CPO) based adhesion promoter. Three-point bending and crosscut adhesion tests performed on these plates show that adherence is better on PP/EP than on PP. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and force modulation microscopy (FMM) {{analyses were performed}} on the failure surface obtained after the three-point bending test. XPS shows that the Cl atomic fraction is less than 0. 5 % on the polymer side and close to 4 % on the paint side indicating that the fracture {{is located at the}} CPO-polymer interface. The analysis of the PPEP surface by FMM reveals that paint debonding occurs with plastic deformations located into the EP elastomer phase. The magnitude of the plastic deformation is dependent on the depth location of the nodules. The adherence improvement induced by the presence of EP nodules can thus be explained by energy dissipation occurring during EP deformation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|CinemaArt {{released}} {{the film in}} the Czech Republic on 6 March 2009. Peter Debruge compared the film to Toy Story in a reviews for Variety, and complimented the animation: [...] "despite their inflexible faces, Barta conceives all sorts of inventive ways to bring these inanimate objects to life. … Should a given shot prove too tricky to accomplish practically, Barta has no qualms about using digital compositing to <b>blend</b> multiple stop-motion <b>plates.</b> Though rudimentary, fire and water effects are especially effective." [...] About the film's commercial prospects, Debruge wrote: [...] "For all its charms, In the Attic feels vaguely sinister and may prove too intense for younger kids - {{a testament to the}} film's pacing and score, as well as how deeply auds emotionally connect with these occasionally macabre toy characters." [...] The film has been honored with awards including an Excellence Prize for animation at the 2010 Japan Media Arts Festival, those for best feature at the 2010 New York International Children's Film Festival and the 2011 Tehran International Animation Festival, in both winning over The Secret of Kells, and the Kecskemét City Award at the 7th Festival of European Animated Feature Films and TV Specials in 2011.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} fluoride release, flexural strength and surface characteristics of three orthodontic acrylic resins (A) blended with (1) sodium fluoride powder (NaF), (2) calcium fluoride powder (CaF 2), and (3) glass ionomer cement powder (GIC). Material & Methods: Acrylic resin was blended with NaF, CaF 2, and GIC to make orthodontic acrylic plates. Each sample group {{was divided into}} subgroups at fluoride concentrations 5 %, 10 % and 20 %. The acrylic resin was cured in a round stainless steel mold and kept in a bottle with 10 ml. deionized water then kept in an incubator at 37 o C. The deionized water, changed every day, was tested for fluoride release up to six mo by Orion machine. For the flexural strength test, the samples were cured in a stainless steel mold, 64 mm. long, 10 mm. wide and 3. 3 mm. high according to standard of ISO 20795 - 2 and testing was done up to 6 mo in deionized water. Scanning electron microscope determined surface characteristics after being blended. Results: Fluoride release was observed from orthodontic acrylic <b>plates</b> <b>blended</b> with NaF, CaF 2 and GIC.

50|$|The {{scene where}} the Allosaurus attacks {{the village is}} similar to one in the {{original}} film. Shortly after the creature appears it plucks a man out of the water. They used an actor suspended on wires and Harryhausen positioned an animated model man over the actor, on the rear projection plate; thus {{it seemed as if}} the live actor was being eaten. Another technically complex scene in this part of the film was when a man fighting the Allosaurus is trapped under a shelter: the dinosaur grabs a support and collapses it. The team used a full-size shelter rigged to collapse at that point during the action. Harryhausen then placed a miniature part in the creature's mouth which, when all lined up on the rear projection <b>plate,</b> <b>blended</b> in perfectly. The final significant scene in this sequence is when Tumak impales the creature on a spear from below. John Richardson, the actor who played Tumak, held nothing in the long shots and pretended to have a pole in his hands, but he did hold a pole in the close-up shots. A miniature pole was built and used for the long shots. It was placed in the studio in front of Richardson's hands, and then Ray animated the Allosaurus suspended on wires in front of John, on top of the miniature pole.|$|R
40|$|California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo is {{currently}} working towards developing a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) database for future code validation efforts. Cal Poly will complete a wind tunnel test on the Advanced Model for Extreme Lift and Improved Aeroacoustics (AMELIA) in the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) 40 foot by 80 foot wind tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center {{in the summer of}} 2011. The development of two measurement techniques is discussed in this work, both with the objective of making measurements on AMELIA for CFD validation. First, the work on the application of the Fringe-Imaging Skin Friction (FISF) technique to AMELIA is discussed. The FISF technique measures the skin friction magnitude and direction by applying oil droplets on a surface, exposing them to flow, measuring their thickness, and correlating their thickness to the local skin friction. The technique has the unique ability to obtain global skin friction measurements. A two foot, nickel <b>plated,</b> <b>blended</b> wing section test article has been manufactured specifically for FISF. The model is illuminated with mercury vapor lamps and imaged with a Canon 50 D with a 546 nm bandpass filter. Various tests are applied to the wing in order to further characterize uncertainties related with the FISF technique. Human repeatability has uncertainties of ± 2. 3 % of fringe spacing and ± 2. 0 ° in skin friction vector direction, while image post processing yields ± 25 % variation in skin friction coefficient. A method for measuring photogrammetry uncertainty is developed. The effect of filter variation and test repeatability was found to be negligible. A validation against a Preston tube was found to have 1. 8 % accuracy. Second, the validation of a micro flow measurement device is investigated. Anemometers have always had limited capability in making near wall measurements, driving the design of new devices capable of measurements with increased wall proximity. Utilizing a thermocouple boundary layer rake, wall measurements within 0. 0025 inches of the surface have been made. A Cross Correlation Rake (CCR) has the advantage of not requiring calibration but obtaining the same proximity and resolution as the thermocouple boundary layer rake. The flow device utilizes time of flight measurements computed via cross correlation to calculate wall velocity profiles. The CCR was designed to be applied to AMELIA to measure flow velocities above a flap in a transonic flow regime. The validation of the CCR was unsuccessful. Due to the fragile construction of the CCR, only one data point at 0. 10589 inches from the surface was available for validation. The subsonic wind tunnel’s variable frequency drive generated noise which could not be filtered or shielded, requiring the use of a flow bench for validation testing. Since velocity measurements could not be made in the flow bench, a comparison of a fast and slow velocity was made. The CCR was not able to detect {{the difference between the two}} flow velocities. Currently, the CCR cannot be applied on AMELIA due to the unsuccessfully validation of the device...|$|R
40|$|Titanium and {{titanium}} alloys, due {{to their}} higher cost are seldom used for varied applications, unlike aluminium, magnesium and steel, which are widely used. Powder metallurgical route has given {{a new dimension to}} produce low-cost, near-net shaped parts using titanium powders. The conventional method of producing titanium alloys is through either blended elemental process of pre-alloyed process. The limitation of the aforementioned processes are that, not all elements can be alloyed, owing to their higher costs. As an alternative to the conventional <b>blending</b> process, Electroless <b>plating</b> is introduced to alloy titanium powders in the present work. Two types of commercially pure grade- 2 titanium powders, which differ in their particle sizedistribution and morphology are used and are named as grade-A and grade-B. The grade Aand grade B powders were coated with nickel-phosphorus (Ni-P) and nickel-boron (Ni-B) separately. The Ni-P coating on the powders was performed in acidic condition and Ni-B coating, in alkaline condition. The uncoated, Ni-P coated and Ni-B coated powders were characterized for their particle size distribution using Malvern Mastersizer instrument, particle shape through Richardson plot and chemical composition using Inductive Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and LECO analyser. It was found that on coating the powders with Ni-P and Ni-B separately, a change in the apparent density and tap density values were observed. The Hausner ratio, which signifies the rearrangability of the powders, was found to be highestfor the powders in uncoated condition and lowest, when coated with Ni-B. The morphology of the particles characterized using Richardson plot revealed that on coating, the shape of the particle changed from irregular (in uncoated condition) to being more regular (after coating with Ni-P and Ni-B). Also, the particle roughness was found to have decreased upon coating. A novel method, combining the aspects of the Kawakita and Alderborn approaches, has been employed {{in order to understand the}} compaction behaviour of the uncoated and coated powders. The overall consolidaton is described by the Kawakita-Ludde relationship, and the transition pressures which demarcate the limits of ”rearrangement only” and ”plastic deformation only” are identified using a modification of the Alderborn relationship. A significant increase in the green strength is achieved with the Ni-B coated powders, and this is attributed to a modification of friction conditions and the number of contacts, which lead to an increased contribution from plastic deformation. The Mohr-Coulomb and Ohyane equations are used to describe the effect. The compaction behaviour was further analysed using the Drucker-Prager-Cap model in the combined ”rearrangement + plastic deformation” and ”plastic deformation only” regions. The aforementioned mechanisms are explained in detail by constructing the cap surfaces at different stress ratio’s (ratio between hydrostatic stress and deviatoric stress). The early stage sintering behaviour of the uncoated and coated powders were studied using the sintering data (relative sinter density vs. temperature), dilatometer and differential thermalanalyser (DTA) curves, X-ray diffraction peaks at different sintering temperatures, optical and scanning electron micrographs. The sintered uncoated powders showed greater densification in the beta-titanium phase field than in the alpha-titanium phase field. Also, from the dilatometer and DTA curves, it was found that the transformation of alpha-titanium to beta-titanium phase field is not a sudden process, rather a gradual process. The formation of secondary phases like Ti 2 Ni, Ti 3 P in the Ni-P coated powders were found to influence the densification. The relative sinter density values of the Ni-P coated powders were found to be less than that of the uncoated powders. The sintering activation energy values for uncoated and Ni-P coated powders were calculated using Wang and Raj method and Maqueda method. Plastic flow was found to be the dominant sintering mechanism in uncoated grade A and grade B powders in the temperature range between 900 oC and 1300 oC. The Ni-P coated powders showed grain boundary diffusion as the dominant sintering mechanism between 623 oC and 827 oC and plastic flow between 900 oC and 1300 oC. The Ni-B coated grade A and grade B powders showed poor sintering behaviour when compared to the uncoated and Ni-P coated powder. The swelling of compacts were observed after sintering, which was attributed to the presence of elements like sodium and chlorine, which were co-deposited during the electroless plating process. The uncoated, Ni-P coated and Ni-B coated powders were powder rolled and their mechanical properties were determined. It was found that the mechanical properties of Ni-P coated powder rolled strip were found to be superior to the uncoated and Ni-B coated powders.
