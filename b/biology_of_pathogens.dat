40|$|Vascular wilts {{are among}} the most {{destructive}} plant diseases that occur in annual crops as well as in woody perennials. These diseases are generally caused by soil-borne bacteria, fungi and oomycetes that infect through the roots and enter the water-conducting xylem vessels where they proliferate and obstruct the transportation of water and minerals.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In gene-for-gene {{models of}} plant-pathogen interactions, the {{existence}} of fitness costs associated with unnecessary virulence factors still represents an issue, both in evolutionary biology and agricultural sciences. Measuring such costs experimentally has proven difficult, especially in pathogens not readily amenable to genetic transformation, since the creation of isogenic lines differing only by {{the presence or absence}} of avirulence genes cannot be achieved in many organisms. Here, we circumvented this difficulty by comparing fitness traits in groups of Phytophthora infestans isolates sharing the same multilocus fingerprint, but differing by their virulence/avirulence spectrum. RESULTS: Fitness was assessed from calculations derived from the basic reproduction number, combining several life history traits (latent period, spore density and lesion growth rate) evaluated on leaflets of the potato cultivar Bintje, which is free of resistance genes. A statistically significant fitness cost was found in isolates virulent to the R 10 resistance gene. That cost was due to a lower spore production in virulent isolates; however, the latent period was shorter in virulent isolates. Similar trends, although not statistically significant, were observed for the other genes tested.

In particular, virulence costs when the corresponding host resistance gene is lacking {{play a major role}} in the adaptive <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>pathogens</b> and contribute to the maintenance of their genetic diversity. Here, we investigated whether life-history traits directly linked to the establishment of plant-nematode interactions, that is, ability to locate and move toward the roots of the host plant, and to invade roots and develop into mature females, are affected in Meloidogyne incognita lines virulent against the tomato Mi- 1. 2 resistance gene. Virulent and avirulent near-isogenic lines only differing in their capacity to reproduce or not on resistant tomatoes were compared in single inoculation or pairwise competition experiments. Data highlighted (1) a global lack of trade-off in traits associated with unnecessary virulence with respect to the nematode ability to successfully infest plant roots and (2) variability in these traits when the genetic background of the nematode is considered irrespective of its (a) virulence status. These data suggest that the variation detected here is independent from the adaptation of M. incognita to host resistance, but rather reflects some genetic polymorphism in this asexual organism...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{identification}} of fungal phytopathogens {{is essential for}} virtually all aspects of plant pathology, from fundamental research on the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>pathogens</b> to {{the control of the}} diseases they cause. Although molecular methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are routinely used in the diagnosis of human diseases, they are not yet widely used to detect and identify plant pathogens. Here we review some of the diagnostic tools currently used for fungal plant pathogens. and describe some novel applications. Technological advances in PCR-based methods, such as real-time PCR, allow fast, accurate detection and quantification of plant pathogens and are now being applied to practical problems. Molecular methods have been used to detect several pathogens simultaneously in wheat, and to study the development of fungicide resistance in wheat pathogens. Information resulting from such work could be used to improve disease control by allowing more rational decisions to be made about the choice and use of fungicides and resistant cultivars. Molecular methods have also been applied to the study of variation in plant pathogen populations, for example detection of different mating types or virulence types. PCR-based methods can provide new tools to monitor the exposure of a crop to pathogen inoculum that are more reliable and faster than conventional methods. This information can be used to improve disease control decision making. The development and application of molecular diagnostic methods in the future is discussed and we expect that new developments will increase the adoption of these new technologies for the diagnosis and study of plant disease.

In this work, we have explored the capability of capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry with a sheathless interface with electrospray ionization (CE-ESI-TOF-MS) to separate metabolites in order {{to be used as a}} complementary technique to LC. As proof of concept, we have compared the metabolome of Leishmania infantum promastigotes BCN 150 (Sb (III) IC 50 = 20. 9 mu M) and its variation when treated with 120 mu M of Sb(III) potassium tartrate for 12 h, as well as with its Sb(III) resistant counterpart obtained by growth of the parasites under increasing Sb(III) in a step-wise manner up to 180 mu M. The number of metabolites compared were of 264 for BCN 150 Sb(III) treated versus nontreated and of 195 for Sb(III) resistant versus susceptible parasites. After successive data filtering, differences in seven metabolites identified in databases for Leishmania pathways, showed the highest significant differences, corresponding mainly to amino acids or their metabolite surrogates. Most of them were assigned to sulfur containing amino acids and polyamine biosynthetic pathways, of special relevance considering the deterioration of the thiol-dependent redox metabolism in Leishmania by Sb(III). Given the low concentrations typical for most of these metabolites, the assay can be considered a success that should be explored for new biological questions.

40|$|Progress in combatting zoonoses {{that emerge}} from {{wildlife}} is often constrained by limited knowledge of the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>pathogens</b> within reservoir hosts. We focus on the host-pathogen dynamics of four emerging viruses associated with bats: Hendra, Nipah, Ebola, and Marburg viruses. Spillover of bat infections to humans and domestic animals often coincides with pulses of viral excretion within bat populations, but the mechanisms driving such pulses are unclear. Three hypotheses dominate current research on these emerging bat infections. First, pulses of viral excretion could reflect seasonal epidemic cycles driven by natural variations in population densities and contact rates among hosts. If lifelong immunity follows recovery, viruses may disappear locally but persist globally through migration; in either case, new outbreaks occur once births replenish the susceptible pool. Second, epidemic cycles could {{be the result of}} waning immunity within bats, allowing local circulation of viruses through oscillating herd immunity. Third, pulses could be generated by episodic shedding from persistently infected bats through a combination of physiological and ecological factors. The three scenarios can yield similar patterns in epidemiological surveys, but strategies to predict or manage spillover risk resulting from each scenario will be different. We outline an agenda for research on viruses emerging from bats that would allow for differentiation among the scenarios and inform development of evidence-based interventions to limit threats to human and animal health.

Accumulating evidence is demonstrating that PID emergence is mediated by multiple processes, including changes specific to micro-organisms, their biotic and abiotic environment and their dissemination {{both within and}} outside of agricultural systems. Management of emerging PIDs could benefit from the One Health concept that has greatly facilitated the understanding and management of emerging diseases of humans and animals due to its comprehensive integration of the ecology and <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>pathogens,</b> and land-use considerations. The complex ecology of the bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae provides a unique opportunity for developing such an approach for PIDs. This bacteria resides {{in a wide range of}} crop and non-crop plants, aquatic environments and in soil organic matter; and its dissemination is linked to the water cycle. P. syringae currently represents a complex of 13 genetic lineages of strains for which molecular tools of detection are available, allowing the analysis of P. syringae population structure. Phenotypic traits are highly variable and are involved in different stages of P. syringae life cycle as an epiphyte, saprophyte, pathogen and biological ice nucleator, an important property that underlies P. synringae role in rain and snow precipitation. For such a ubiquitous micro-organism as P. syringae, strategies of complete eradication are unrealistic. We will present a framework to assess how P. syringae abundance and communities can be regulated in crops in order to limit the emergence and dissemination of pathogenic strains while preserving the beneficial role of this bacteria in atmospheric processes.

40|$|Before {{the advent}} <b>of</b> {{molecular}} <b>biology</b> methods, studies <b>of</b> <b>pathogens</b> {{were dominated by}} analyses of their metabolism. Development <b>of</b> molecular <b>biology</b> techniques then enabled the identification and functional characterisation of the fascinating toolbox of virulence factors. Increasing, genomic and proteomic approaches {{form the basis for}} a more systemic view on pathogens' functions in the context of infection. Re-emerging interest in the metabolism <b>of</b> <b>pathogens</b> and hosts further expands our view of infections. There is increasing evidence that virulence functions and metabolism <b>of</b> <b>pathogens</b> are extremely intertwined. Type three secretion systems (T 3 SSs) are major virulence determinants <b>of</b> many Gram-negative <b>pathogens</b> and it is the objective of this review to illustrate the intertwined relationship between T 3 SSs and the metabolism <b>of</b> the <b>pathogens</b> deploying them...|$|R
