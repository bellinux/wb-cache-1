25|$|While {{offering}} some 16 AP courses, BCA {{does not}} focus on them. This often hurts its placement in rankings with methodologies that place great weight on the test-driven, college level courses. BCA has traditionally given teachers great freedom in curriculum design to adequately engage the intellectual capacity of the student body.
