Or, a counter can be used that is driven by a sampling clock running at some multiple of the data stream frequency, with the counter reset on every transition of the data stream and the data stream sampled at some predetermined count. These two types of oversampling are sometimes called spatial and time respectively.The best <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> <b>ratio</b> (BER) is obtained when the samples are taken {{as far away as}} possible from any data stream transitions.
