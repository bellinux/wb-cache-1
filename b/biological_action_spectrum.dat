40|$|A {{considerable}} {{interest is}} growing worldwide about the photobiological {{effects of the}} ultraviolet radiation; in fact, it has been demonstrated that ultraviolet radiation can affect both human health {{as well as the}} equilibrium of entire ecosystems. The relative effectiveness of ultraviolet radiation at a particular wavelength in producing a specific biological response is defined by an action spec-trum. Broadband radiometers characterized by having a spectral response that matches an action spectrum allow the measure of the effective irradiance associated to an ultraviolet source. In this work we present the designs of interference filters to be used in radiometric heads. Their optimized transmission curve coupled to the spectral response of different ultraviolet photodiodes provides the match of the sensor spectral response with some selected action spectra. Development of in-struments for the measurement of the effective solar irradiance is foreseen.

The new dosimeter {{is based on the}} two photoactive materials polysulphone and nalidixic acid, each in thin film form layered {{on top of one another}} to provide a combined response. The quantitative characteristics of the UVPGI dosimeter were measured, including the spectral response, dose response, dark reaction and cosine response. The spectral response of the new dosimeter has been successfully extended into the UVA waveband. The dark reaction was within a reasonable limit that could be taken into account when measurements are taken by measuring the post-exposure absorbances at a consistent time period after the exposure. The cosine response approximated the cosine function to better than 15 % for solar zenith angles up to 50 °. The dose response shows that the new dosimeter can be employed for the measurement of UVPGI exposures and has reproducibility comparable to other dosimeters calibrated to a <b>biological</b> <b>action</b> <b>spectrum...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the complex nature of the UV environment on the earth’s surface, long term monitoring programs along with research to quantify the ambient and personal UV exposures in different environments must be employed. The Centre for Astronomy and Atmospheric Research (CfAAR) at the University of Southern Queensland’s has been undertaking this research {{for the past seven years}} in South East Queensland. The spectral biologically damaging UV is measured in different environments with a transportable spectroradiometer. Research on personal UV exposures to humans in different environments utilizes polysulphone dosimeters that are fabricated in CfAAR at USQ. Currently, CfAAR operates a Brewer spectrophotometer to compliment the UV measurement research program. The Brewer spectrophotometer, the first in Australia, automatically measures spectral solar UV irradiances and atmospheric ozone and sulphur dioxide throughout the day. As this instrument measures spectral irradiances, <b>biological</b> <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> may be used to weight the collected UV data to calculate the biologically damaging UV.

40|$|Phototherapy is, in its {{broadest}} sense, the use {{of light}} {{for any kind of}} surgical or nonsurgical treatment, but it is the athermal and atraumatic therapeutic application of light which is now accepted as the working definition of phototherapy. The early light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were unsuitable for clinical applica-tions because of low unstable output powers, broad wavebands and very high angles of divergence. In the late 1990 ’s, the Space Medicine Programme in the United States National Aeronautics and Space Admin-istration (NASA), developed the ‘NASA LED ’ with much higher output powers, a much narrower diver-gence and quasimonochromatic output. With the ability to mount multiple LEDs in planar arrays, large areas of tissue can be irradiated in one hands-off session, unlike the time-consuming and therapist-inten-sive punctal application with laser diodes. These arrays deliver almost laser-like wavelength specificity and with clinically useful penetration depths and intensities, three of the most important considerations when considering cellular targets {{in the light of the}} first law of photobiology which states that without ab-sorption, there can be no reaction. In the past few years, LED-based systems have been successfully ap-plied in an increasingly large number of fields, and three major wavelengths have emerged with a good photobiological basis and proven clinical utility: blue, around 415 nm; red, around 633 nm, and near in-frared, around 830 nm. Each has its own specific cellular target or targets and <b>biological</b> <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> and reaction, but it has become even more clear that no single wavelength can accomplish everything and combination LED therapy has proved necessary for greatest efficacy. The application of LEDs has ushered in a new and exciting era in phototherapy, and offers a versatile and inexpensive therapeutic modality ei-ther as a stand-alone therapy, or as an adjunctive approach to enhance the good results of existing surgical modalities...|$|E

Exposure limits for blue light, whole spectrum retinal thermal damage and cataractogenesis are compared with existing biological data and eye damage models.

The inclusion of blue light weighting factors in thermal limit calculations is questioned.

40|$|A small, {{battery-powered}} {{ultraviolet radiation}} detector was developed using three spectrally distinct photodiodes {{housed in a}} weatherproof enclosure (cylinder with r= 16 mm, h= 15 mm) under an acrylic window. Each induced photocurrent (plus a temperature reading) was amplified and conditioned electronically, converted to a digital number and stored in a non-volatile memory space, contained in another small enclosure (cuboid, 100 x 70 x 30 mm). Each reading was time-stamped. The detector was characterised in the laboratory to determine its spectral sensitivity, angular response, linear response, temperature dependency and dark current. It was calibrated in natural sunlight, at a range of solar zenith angles, ozone column amounts and cloud conditions, against a Bentham DTM 300 spectroradiometer. The results showed it to approximate the irradiance weighted by four distinct <b>biological</b> <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> with an overall accuracy of 20 %. It was tested {{in a number of}} field settings and shown to operate in a range of environmental conditions and provide data that had scientific relevance. A number of the detectors were used in two personal dosimetry experiments. The data revealed distinct exposure patterns between occupational and recreational days, and highlighted the strong influence of behavior on both ultraviolet exposure rates and integrated doses. Further, it was shown that the relative balance of previtamin D photosynthesis and erythemally weighted irradiance is not dependent on solar zenith angle when one considers a population with varying behaviors in a variable climate.

40|$|I {{was trained}} as a {{physicist}} in graduate school. Hence, when I decided {{to go into the}} field of biophysics, it was natural that I concentrated on the effects of light on relatively simple biological systems, such as proteins. The wavelengths absorbed by the amino acid subunits of proteins are in the ultraviolet (UV). The wavelengths that affect the <b>biological</b> activities, the <b>action</b> <b>spectra,</b> also are in the UV, but are not necessarily parallel to the absorption spectra. Understanding these differences led me to investigate the <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> for affecting nucleic acids, and the effects of UV on viruses and cells. The latter studies led me to the discovery of the important molecular nature of the damages affecting DNA (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers) and to the discovery of nucleotide excision repair. Individuals with the genetic disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) are extraordinarily sensitive to sunlight-induced skin cancer. The finding, by James Cleaver, that their skin cells were defective in DNA repair strongly suggested that DNA damage was a key step in carcinogenesis. Such information was important for estimating the wavelengths in sunlight responsible for human skin cancer and for predicting the effects of ozone depletion on the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer. It took experiments with backcross hybrid fish {{to call attention to the}} probable role of the longer UV wavelengths not absorbed by DNA in the induction of melanoma.

40|$|<b>Action</b> <b>spectra</b> for the {{assimilation}} of nitrate and nitrite have been obtained for several blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) with different accessory pigment composition. The <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> for both nitrate and nitrite utilization by nitrate-grown Anacystis nidulans L- 1402 - 1 cells exhibited a clear peak at about 620 nanometers, corresponding to photosystem II (PSII) C-phycocyanin absorption, the contribution of chlorophyll a (Chl a) being barely detectable. The <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for nitrate reduction by a nitrite reductase mutant of A. nidulans R 2 was very similar. All these <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> resemble the fluorescence excitation spectrum of cell suspensions of the microalgae monitored at 685 nanometers—the fluorescence band of Chl a in PSII. In contrast, the <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for nitrite utilization by nitrogen-starved A. nidulans cells, which are depleted of C-phycocyanin, showed a maximum near 680 nanometers, attributable to Chl a absorption. The <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for nitrite utilization by Calothrix sp.

The <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for the preillumination phase of potentiation, during which preillumination followed by a dark period brings about lag elimination in chlorophyll synthesis when the cells are subsequently exposed to postilluminating light, shows a high peak in the blue region (at about 433 nm) with a small peak in the yellow-orange region (at about 597 nm); the postillumination phase yields an <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{very similar to that}} obtained for chlorophyll synthesis in continuous light in normal, unpotentiated cells, with peaks at 433 and 631 nm. Alkaline DNase and TPN-linked triose phosphate dehydrogenase, two plastid enzymes which are synthesized outside the chloroplast, yield <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> which are consistent with protochlorophyll(ide) being the major light receptor.

40|$|Many solar UV measurements, either {{terrestrial}} or personal, weight the {{raw data}} by the erythemal <b>action</b> <b>spectrum.</b> However, a problem arises when one tries to estimate the benefit of vitamin D(3) production based on erythemally weighted outdoor doses, like those measured by calibrated R-B meters or polysulphone badges, because the differences between <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> give dissimilar values. While both <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> peak in the UVB region, the erythemal <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> continues throughout the UVA region while the previtamin D(3) <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> stops near that boundary.

Thus, to do proper benefit assessments, one must incorporate <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> conversion factors (ASCF) into the calculations to change erythemally weighted to previtamin D(3) -weighted doses.

Moreover, light <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> of nitrogenase activity shifted during the day, probably as the result of changes in the phycobiliprotein content of the heterocyst relative to chl a. <b>Action</b> <b>spectra</b> of nitrogenase and changes in pigment composition are essential for the understanding of the competitive abilities of species and for the estimation of N 2 fixation by a bloom of heterocystous cyanobacteri...|$|R
40|$|Cultures of {{unicellular}} algal flagellate Euglena gracilis {{grown in}} different conditions {{were subjected to}} action spectroscopy for step-down and step-up photophobic responses, respectively. The spectral region was extended into the UV-B/C {{as well as in}} the UV-A and visible regions with the Okazaki Large Spectrograph as the monochromatic light source. The photophobic responses of the cells were measured with an individual-cell assay method with the aid of a computerized video motion analyzer. In the UV-A and visible regions, the shapes of the <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> were the so-called UV-A/blue type. In the newly studied UV-B/C region, new action peaks were found at 270 nm for the step-down response and at 280 nm for the step-up one. The absorption spectrum of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) appeared to fit the <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for the step-up response, whereas the shape of the step-down <b>action</b> <b>spectrum,</b> which has a UV-A peak (at 370 nm) higher than the blue peak (at 450 nm), appeared to he mimicked by the absorption spectrum of a mixed solution of 6 -biopterin and FAD. These observations might also account for the fact that the UV-B/C peak wavelength at 270 nm of the <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for the step-down response is shorter by 10 nm than the <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for the step-up response at 280 nm...|$|R
