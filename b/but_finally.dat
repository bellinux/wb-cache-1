Krishnasamy initially refused to include the scene involving Meena's death as it reminded him of his daughter, <b>but</b> <b>finally</b> did so reluctantly. The character was played by Baby Kanchana.|$|E
5|$|After a short {{stint in}} the minors in 2000, Nathan {{spent most of the}} season in the majors, {{finishing}} 5–2 and even hitting two home runs. But he struggled with his control, walking 63 in 93 innings and ending the season with a 5.21 ERA. He was on the disabled list twice: from May 17 to June 6 for right shoulder tendinitis and from July 14 to August 18 for an inflamed right shoulder, necessitating arthroscopic surgery on the afflicted shoulder {{at the end of the}} season. Nathan divided 2001 between the AAA Fresno Grizzlies and AA Shreveport both starting and relieving, finishing with a disappointing combined 3–11 record and an ERA over 7. Nathan improved slightly in 2002 to 6–12 with an ERA of over 5 at Fresno, <b>but</b> <b>finally</b> overcame his postsurgical struggles to return to the Giants in September with 3 scoreless innings in relief.|$|E

5|$|As {{commander}} of the Foederati, Thomas was based at Amorion, {{the capital of the}} Anatolic Theme. Although junior to the theme's strategos (military governor), his proclamation received widespread support throughout Asia Minor. Within a short time, all the Asian themes supported Thomas, except for the Opsician Theme under the patrician Katakylas, a nephew of Michael II, and the Armeniac Theme, under its strategos, Olbianos. The Thracesian Theme wavered between the two rivals, <b>but</b> <b>finally</b> threw its support behind Thomas. More than two-thirds of the empire's Asian army eventually aligned with Thomas, while the defection of the provincial tax officials provided him with much-needed revenue.|$|E
5|$|Asher {{broke off}} the {{engagement}} in early 1968, after {{coming back from}} an acting assignment in Bristol to find McCartney in bed with another woman, Francie Schwartz. McCartney and Asher later attempted to mend their relationship, <b>but</b> <b>finally</b> broke up in July1968. Asher has consistently refused to publicly discuss {{that part of her}} life. Schwartz, a twenty three year old New York scriptwriter, had travelled to London trying to interest Apple Corps in a film script. Schwartz was then asked by McCartney to move into his Cavendish Avenue house, and was given a job working for Derek Taylor at Apple, which was then based in Wigmore Street, London. She attended many sessions during the recording of the White Album, and was living with McCartney when Lennon and Yoko Ono were also invited to live there. Shortly after, Schwartz sold the story of her time at Cavendish Avenue to Rolling Stone magazine.|$|E
5|$|Chépart {{himself was}} taken captive by the Natchez, {{who were at}} first unsure {{what to do with}} him, <b>but</b> <b>finally</b> decided that he should be killed by a stinkard—a member of the lowest caste in the tribe's hierarchy. The Natchez kept two Frenchmen alive, a carter named Mayeux who was made to carry all the goods of the French to the Great Village, and a tailor named Le Beau who was {{employed}} by the Natchez to refit the colonists' clothing to new owners. They set fire to the fort, the store, and all the homesteads, burning them to the ground. Just as Governor Bienville had done with the executed Indians in 1717 and 1723, the Natchez beheaded the dead Frenchmen and brought the severed heads for the Great Sun to view.|$|E

5|$|Faced with a {{shortage}} of both funds and men, the Senate decided to send an embassy to Julius in order to negotiate a settlement. The terms insisted on by the Pope were harsh: the Republic lost her traditional power to appoint clergy in her territory, {{as well as all}} jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venice, the Romagnan cities that had prompted the war were to be returned to Julius, and reparations were to be paid to cover his expenses in capturing them. The Senate argued over the terms for two months, <b>but</b> <b>finally</b> accepted them on February 24, 1510. Even before the Venetian ambassadors had presented themselves to Julius for absolution, however, the Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity.|$|E

In 1092, Dalassenos {{and the new}} megas doux, John Doukas, were sent against Tzachas, and attacked the fortress of Mytilene on Lesbos.

During his return to Smyrna, Dalassenos attacked the Turkish fleet, which was almost destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Kheda {{was hit by}} {{floods and}} famine and the {{peasantry}} was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win {{public support for the}} agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused <b>but</b> <b>finally</b> in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|In terukkuttu performances, at {{the time}} of Aravan's sacrifice, he is often {{compared}} to Puru and Bhishma, characters in the Mahabharata who gave up their youth and sexual fulfilment for the sake of their respective fathers, Yayati and Santanu. In the drama, after acquiring Aravan's approval, Krishna approaches Aravan's mother, Ulupi—Nagakanni or Nakakanni ("Serpent maiden") in Tamil, for her consent.

Peng eventually pushed Kuomintang forces out of Shaanxi in February 1948.|$|E
5|$|Parliament met in February 1308 in {{a heated}} atmosphere. Edward was eager to discuss the {{potential}} for governmental reform, but the barons were unwilling to begin any such debate until the problem of Gaveston had been resolved. Violence seemed likely, but the situation was resolved through the mediation of the moderate Henry de Lacy, the Earl of Lincoln, who convinced the barons to back down. A fresh parliament was held in April, where the barons once again criticised Gaveston, demanding his exile, this time supported by Isabella and the French monarchy. Edward resisted, <b>but</b> <b>finally</b> acquiesced, agreeing to send Gaveston to Aquitaine, under threat of excommunication by the Archbishop of Canterbury should he return. At the last moment, Edward {{changed his mind and}} instead sent Gaveston to Dublin, appointing him as the Lieutenant of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Ravana fights {{the final}} duel with Rama. Rama fails to kill Ravana with his {{ordinary}} arrows, <b>but</b> <b>finally</b> kills with a magical arrow. While Valmiki's Ramayana narrates that the magical arrow {{was given to}} Rama by Indra, in other versions the magical arrow is hidden in Mandodari's bed chambers or under her bed. While Mandodari is engrossed in worshipping the goddess Parvati for Ravana's wellbeing, Hanuman comes to her disguised as a Brahmin. After winning her confidence, he tricks her into revealing the secret location of the arrow. Hanuman seizes the arrow and gives it to Rama, leading to Ravana's end. Mandodari appears at the death scene of Ravana in a disarrayed state and laments his death. In this battle, Mandodari loses her husband, her sons, and her kinsmen.|$|E
