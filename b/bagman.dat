25|$|<b>Bagman</b> loves gambling, {{which got}} him in {{financial}} trouble so severe that he pays some of his creditors (including Fred and George Weasley) with disappearing Leprechaun Gold, after they have gambled on the Quidditch World Cup. After the World Cup final, some goblins corner him in the woods outside the stadium and take all the gold he had on him, which {{is not enough to}} cover his debts. To clear his debts with the goblins, <b>Bagman</b> makes a bet on the Triwizard Tournament, of which {{he is one of the}} judges. He bets the goblins that Harry would win. He tries to help Harry over the course of the Tournament, giving him a perfect score in the First Task even though he is injured, and offering him advice. Harry and Cedric Diggory end up tying for first place in the tournament, and <b>Bagman</b> does not win the bet as the goblins argue that <b>Bagman</b> was betting Harry would win outright. <b>Bagman</b> runs away after the Third Task of the Tournament.|$|E
25|$|Crawford {{left for}} New Zealand in 1929 {{and stayed there}} until 1932. His {{intention}} was to travel to South America and then head back to England, but when boarding a ship that was supposedly going to Valparaíso, it landed in Australia. Australia {{was going through the}} depression which forced Crawford to join the unemployed <b>bagman.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Department of Magical Games and Sports, seen as {{the most}} relaxed {{department}} (posters for favourite Quidditch teams are found tacked to the walls), deals with organising sports events like the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament. Ludo <b>Bagman</b> {{used to be the}} Head of Department here, but his gambling problem forced him to flee from Goblin creditors. The department is located on the seventh level of the Ministry of Magic, and includes the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club, and the Ludicrous Patents Office– other sports and games-related aspects of the Harry Potter world.|$|E

60|$|This sally was {{received}} with laughter and applause, for local feeling {{was very strong}} in Stokebridge, and a storm of jeers and rough chaff were poured upon the <b>bagmen</b> for having been brought in prisoners by a child.|$|R
2500|$|Bagman's {{character}} {{was cut from}} the film adaptation of the fourth book. Some of Ludo's primary functions in the story were performed by Cornelius Fudge and Barty Crouch Sr., in the film adaptation. <b>Bagman</b> appears in the [...] video game as a Quidditch announcer.|$|E
2500|$|Ludovic [...] "Ludo" [...] <b>Bagman</b> is {{a retired}} {{professional}} Quidditch player, formerly a highly successful Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps and England's international team, whose good looks have gone a bit to seed; his nose is squashed in (apparently having been broken by a stray Bludger) and he is quite a bit thicker around the middle {{than he was in}} his Quidditch days. He {{was the head of the}} Department of Magical Games and Sports. Rowling uses Dumbledore's Pensieve to reveal in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire that <b>Bagman</b> was accused of being a Death Eater about thirteen years before the events of the fourth book because he had given information to recently discovered Death Eater Augustus Rookwood. It is stated that he had believed Rookwood, who was his father's friend, to be beyond suspicion, and that; consequently, he had thought that he was aiding the Ministry by passing the information on to him.|$|E
2500|$|The Journal-Americans {{investigation}} eventually {{focused on}} Eddie Gard, a player for the Long Island University basketball team who {{was believed to}} be acting as a <b>bagman</b> for the gambling interests. In early January 1951, Kase met secretly with New York District Attorney Frank Hogan. Kase shared his findings with Hogan and agreed to withhold the story until Hogan could develop the case further. [...] Using the evidence collected by Kase, Hogan began tailing Gard and tapped his phone. [...] The investigation resulted in the arrest and prosecution of three star players from the City College of New York's 1950 national championship team.|$|E

2500|$|As {{his former}} allies were tried and indicted, Ames {{remained}} on the run. In February 1903, he was arrested {{at the house of}} Rev. C. H. Chapin in Hancock, New Hampshire. Despite a [...] "strong fight {{on the part of the}} fugitive," [...] Ames was extradited to Minnesota and put on trial for receiving a bribe of six hundred dollars from a prostitute. Based on the testimony of his co-conspirators, including his <b>bagman</b> Irwin A. Gardner, Ames was found guilty and sentenced to six years in the Minnesota State Prison at Stillwater. The sentence was overturned on appeal and, after two additional trials ended as mistrials, all legal action against him was ceased.|$|E
2500|$|... "Can {{you imagine}} {{living in the}} thirties, without a job, without a good square meal, without a bed to stretch out on, just {{drifting}} without a purpose? And then (imagine this too) somebody shows you that life has a purpose. That's what New Theatre offered in the late thirties." [...] This was a selling point for many who had no job, no food and no roof over their heads. To make a stand and try to reclaim what is theirs through political and socially fuelled theatre presentations. Crawford was a homeless <b>bagman,</b> interested in theatre and experience at writing and producing plays through his work for the Roving Reds (AKA The Proletarian Players). It was only natural that Crawford should find his home with in the New Theatre society.|$|E
2500|$|Both revivals {{during the}} composer's {{lifetime}} were successful. The Times called the 1884 revival [...] "distinctly {{a step in}} the right direction" [...] and in 1898 the paper claimed that [...] "The Sorcerer is very far from having exhausted its popularity". [...] A review of the 1886 Australian production ranked the opera in [...] "a middle place in Gilbert and Sullivan compositions. [...] Abounding in tuneful numbers, one or two of which rank with anything that has come from Sir Arthur Sullivan's pen, the orchestration is thin compared with that of his later operas and its melodies have never taken the same popular hold as those of Pinafore, a work of about equal calibre from a musical point of view. ... The libretto is sparkling and pungent, and the idea of presenting a British <b>bagman</b> in the guise of a controller of demons and vendor of family curses is as happy a conception as any which has taken form on this modern stage".|$|E
5000|$|Gaining {{commercial}} airplay, a {{major breakthrough}} came with {{the signing of the}} band by Sony (then CBS Records) to a five-year deal. Around that time the band changed its name to Seven Stories, to avoid confusion with US band Tall Stories. The deal with Sony led to the critically acclaimed Judges and <b>Bagmen</b> album in 1990. Rolling Stones review in 1991 stated [...] "it is the music which makes Judges and <b>Bagmen</b> such a compelling album" [...] The band was assisted in the recording by musicians such as Vika and Linda Bull and Broderick Smith. Seven Stories was nominated for the 1991 ARIA Awards in the Best New Artist category. [...] "Sleeping through Another War" [...] and [...] "Walk through Babylon" [...] were released by CBS as singles off the album. The band toured extensively throughout Australia supporting artists such as Midnight Oil, INXS, The Black Sorrows, Hothouse Flowers, Hunters and Collectors and Paul Kelly.|$|R

2500|$|Rabbit first goes {{up against}} Madigan, a virulently racist and {{homophobic}} white {{police officer and}} <b>bagman</b> for the Mafia, who demonstrates his contempt for African-Americans in various ways, including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them (he believes they are not worth it). When Madigan finds out that Rabbit has been taking his payoffs, he and his cohorts, Ruby and Bobby, are led to a nightclub called [...] "The Cottontail". A black stripper distracts him while an LSD sugar cube is dropped into his drink. Madigan, while {{under the influence of}} his spiked drink, is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man, and then shoved into women's clothing representative of the mammy archetype, adorned in blackface, and shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. While recovering from being drugged, he fires his gun randomly, and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{scenes are}} {{shortened}} and amalgamated to include {{only the most}} essential plot details: the three Death Eater trials Harry witnesses in the Pensieve are merged into one sequence; the characters of Bill Weasley, Charlie Weasley, Ludo <b>Bagman,</b> Winky, Narcissa Malfoy and Bertha Jorkins are absent, as well as Dobby, {{who was supposed to}} help Harry obtain Gillyweed for the second task. Instead, that scene was changed to involve Neville Longbottom. There is no train scene at the end where Rita Skeeter is revealed to be an illegal, unregistered animagus; Harry is never seen either receiving or giving away the 1,000 galleons in prize winnings. All of Sirius Black's lines are condensed into a single fireside conversation. The scene in which Crouch Jr. is taken back to Azkaban is different from the book, in which he was [...] "killed" [...] by a Dementor summoned by Cornelius Fudge. There is also no conversation in which Fudge refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned, so this is explained in the next film.|$|E

6000|$|First syllable. Colonel Rawdon Crawley, C.B., with a slouched {{hat and a}} staff, a great-coat, and {{a lantern}} {{borrowed}} from the stables, passed across the stage bawling out, as if warning {{the inhabitants of the}} hour. In the lower window are seen two <b>bagmen</b> playing apparently at the game of cribbage, over which they yawn much. To them enters one looking like Boots (the Honourable G. Ringwood), which character the young gentleman performed to perfection, and divests them of their lower coverings; and presently Chambermaid (the Right Honourable Lord Southdown) with two candlesticks, and a warming-pan. She ascends to the upper apartment and warms the bed. She uses the warming-pan as a weapon wherewith she wards off the attention of the <b>bagmen.</b> She exits. They put on their night-caps and pull down the blinds. Boots comes out and closes the shutters of the ground-floor chamber. You hear him bolting and chaining the door within. All the lights go out.

50|$|At {{the provincial}} level in Quebec, the {{far-reaching}} influence of fundraisers over {{everything from the}} selection of judges to the distribution of construction contracts fuelled widespread demand for a public inquiry into political corruption, and caused the Jean Charest Liberal government and other major political parties to agree to increase the provincial per-vote subsidy {{as a way to}} reduce the influence of party <b>bagmen</b> (influence peddling political fundraisers) over government decisions and policies.|$|R

50|$|The first {{defendant}} to {{be found}} guilty was Harold Conn, Deputy Traffic Court Clerk in the Cook County judicial system.

Maloney, who was indicted in 1991 on bribery charges and convicted in April 1993 of fixing three murder cases for more than $100,000 in bribes. Maloney was released from federal prison in 2008, and died the same year.|$|R
6000|$|Study, by the way,--no, [...] "study" [...] is a vulgar word; {{every word}} is vulgar {{which a man}} uses to give the world an exaggerated notion of himself or his condition.

To be a <b>bagman</b> is to be humble, but not of necessity vulgar. Pomposity is vulgar, to ape a higher rank than your own is vulgar, for an ensign of militia to call himself captain is vulgar, or for a <b>bagman</b> to style himself the [...] "representative" [...] of Dobson and Hobson.
