40|$|Objectives: To {{develop a}} new measure of {{dysfunctional}} thoughts for family caregivers of people living with dementia. These thoughts can contribute to negative outcomes, {{but they may be}} modifiable. Method: A stepwise process was used to develop the Thoughts Questionnaire, commencing with item generation, concept mapping, and pilot testing in a sample of professional and nonprofessional caregivers of people with dementia (n[*]=[*] 18). Next, an independent sample of 35 family caregivers of people with dementia (30 female; M age[*]=[*] 64. 30, standard deviation[*]=[*] 10. 65) completed: (a) the Thoughts Questionnaire; (<b>b)</b> an <b>existing</b> <b>measure</b> of dysfunctional thoughts, the Dementia Thoughts Caregivers Questionnaire; and (c) separate validated measures of depressive symptoms, caregiver stress, and coping, respectively. Results: The level of agreement with dysfunctional thought statements from the Dementia Thoughts Caregivers Questionnaire and Thoughts Questionnaire was low. However, a small number of Thoughts Questionnaire statements were strongly endorsed by over 85...|$|R
40|$|Autism {{symptoms}} are typically assessed in laboratory environments without evaluating contextual variables from the child’s environment. Home environment {{factors such as}} access to activities and parental interaction style {{play a role in}} children’s development. The purpose of this project is to characterize children with autism in their home environment by (a) developing and evaluating observable measures of autism symptoms and child engagement in the home (<b>b)</b> using <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> to assess parental interaction style and household activities (c) assess the degree to which these variables are related. Using a sample of 44 children with autism, reliability calculations were conducted for the novel measures, average scores of autism severity, engagement, parent behaviors, were reported, and mixed linear models and intercorrelation matrices were generated to assess associations between these variables. The novel measures were rated with good reliability and convergent validity. There was a clear relationship between parent behaviors, child engagement, and child autism symptoms. On an average day, children were most likely to be engaged in electronics and/or homework. The findings from this study have the potential to improve understanding of home life in children with autism and illuminate important home characteristics that may influence effectiveness of interventions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} age of {{acquisition}} and repetition priming on picture naming latencies and errors were studied in 22 children who stutter (CWS) and 22 {{children who do}} not stutter (CWNS) {{between the ages of}} 3; 1 and 5; 7. Children participated in a computerized picture naming task where they named pictures of both early and late acquired (AoA) words in two consecutive stages. Findings revealed that all children’s picture naming latencies and errors were reduced following repetition priming and in response to early AoA words relative to late AoA words. AoA and repetition priming effects were similar for children in both talker groups, with one exception. Namely, CWS benefitted significantly more, in terms of error reduction, than CWNS from repetition priming for late AoA words. In addition, CWNS exhibited a significant, positive association between linguistic speed and measures of vocabulary, but CWS did not. These findings were taken to suggest that the (a) semantic–phonological connections of CWS may not be as strong as those of CWNS, and (<b>b)</b> <b>existing</b> lexical <b>measures</b> may not be sensitive enough to differentiate CWS from CWNS in lexically related aspects of language production. Educational objectives: After reading this article, the learner will be able to: (a) describe the effects of repetition priming and age of word acquisition in speech production; (b) summarize the performance similarities and differences of children who stutter and children who do not stutter on a computerized picture naming task; and (c) compare {{the results of the present}} study with previous work in this area...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Many {{researchers}} {{have studied the}} acoustics, physiology, and perceptual characteristics of the voice source, but despite significant attention, it remains unclear which aspects of the source should be quantified and how measurements should be made. In this study, the authors examined the relationships {{among a number of}} <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> of the glottal source spectrum, along with the association of these measures to overall spectral shapes and to glottal pulse shapes, to determine which measures of the source best capture information about the shapes of glottal pulses and glottal source spectra. METHOD: Seventy-eight different measures of source spectral shapes were made on the voices of 70 speakers. Principal components analysis was applied to measurement data, and the resulting factors were compared with factors similarly derived from oral speech spectra and glottal pulses. RESULTS: Results revealed high levels of duplication and overlap among <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> of source spectral slope. Further, <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> were not well aligned with patterns of spectral variability. In particular, <b>existing</b> spectral <b>measures</b> do not appear to model the higher frequency parts of the source spectrum adequately. CONCLUSION: The failure of <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> to adequately quantify spectral variability may explain why results of studies examining the perceptual importance of spectral slope have not produced consistent results. Because variability in the speech signal is often perceptually salient, these results suggest that most <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> of source spectral slope are unlikely to be good predictors of voice quality...|$|R

40|$|Several {{measures}} in social/personality literature claim to assess gender identity. However, no <b>existing</b> <b>measure</b> can predict a person???s self-categorization as female or male???even though self-categorization {{is fundamental to}} self-identity. The Gender Self Overlap Index (GSOI) was developed to measure self-categorization by asking a person to judge their degree of self overlap with multiple gender categories (e. g., female and male). <b>Existing</b> <b>measures</b> rely either on endorsement of gender stereotypes or evaluations of gender in-group members. Using discriminant function analysis we demonstrated that the GSOI is the only measure to predict a person???s self-categorization as female or male in relation to <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> of gender role adherence, gender in-group identification, and gender typicality. Importantly, this pattern replicated irrespective of whether respondents identified as transgender or cisgender (i. e., the same birth-assigned gender category and current gender identity). Accordingly, the GSOI measures gender selfcategorization for all experiences of female and male gender identities...|$|R

We discuss the usefulness of the <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> in the mobile business context, where both mobility and work-context pose specific demands for the mobile business services. The review showed that the <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> rarely consider the great contextual variation caused by the mobility of the services and the demands this poses on usability; which, in turn, affects productivity. To build a measurement tool that better meets the requirements of mobile business services, we completed case studies on two mobile business services, one used in passenger transport and the other in construction sites. Based on the understanding gained from the case studies, we propose a list of dimensions and items addressing both usability and productivity aspects that work as the basis for a multidisciplinary measurement tool...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Existing</b> {{centrality}} <b>measures</b> {{for social}} network analysis suggest the im-portance of an actor and give consideration to actor’s given structural position in a network. These <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> suggest specific attribute of an actor (i. e., popularity, accessibility, and brokerage behavior). In this study, we propose new hybrid centrality measures (i. e., Degree-Degree, Degree-Closeness and Degree-Betweenness), by combining <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> (i. e., degree, closeness and bet-weenness) with a proposition {{to better understand the}} importance of actors in a given network. Generalized set of measures are also proposed for weighted net-works. Our analysis of co-authorship networks dataset suggests significant corre-lation of our proposed new centrality measures (especially weighted networks) than traditional centrality measures with performance of the scholars. Thus, they are useful measures which can be used instead of traditional measures to show prominence of the actors in a network. ...|$|R
