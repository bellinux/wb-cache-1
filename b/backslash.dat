5|$|Evolve {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Aggregating review website Metacritic {{gave the}} PlayStation 4 version 76/100 based on 46 reviews, the Microsoft Windows version 77/100 based on 38 reviews, and the Xbox One version 74/100 based on 31 reviews. The game received <b>backslash</b> from users on Steam, {{due to the}} excessive amount of DLC sold on day one and the game for being overpriced.|$|E
25|$|String: a {{sequence}} of zero or more Unicode characters. Strings are delimited with double-quotation marks and support a <b>backslash</b> escaping syntax.|$|E
25|$|Some of Wasserman Schultz's {{actions that}} the news covered during the {{primaries}} were: having reduced the debate schedule, disinvited former DNC Vice Chair Tulsi Gabbard to the first primary Democratic debate, in an altercation shut down Sanders' campaign's access to the DNC server and thus halting their campaign until immense <b>backslash</b> led to her to rescind it, defended the system of superdelegates {{that were used to}} signal to the support base that Clinton would be nominee, quietly rescinded Obama's 2008 ban on donations to the DNC from corporate lobbyists and PACs and thus paving way for the Hillary Victory Fund that was later reported by Politico to have laundered money to their campaign and DNC having hid the details of its agreement with the Clinton campaign and falsely accused Sanders supporters of violence at the Nevada Convention..|$|E

50|$|The Registry {{contains}} two basic elements: keys and values. Registry keys are container objects similar to folders. Registry values are non-container objects similar to files. Keys may contain values and subkeys. Keys are referenced with a syntax similar to Windows' path names, using <b>backslashes</b> to indicate levels of hierarchy. Keys {{must have a}} case insensitive name without <b>backslashes.</b>|$|R

25|$|The U.S. IBM PC {{keyboard}} has 104 keys, {{while the}} PC keyboards for most {{other countries have}} 105 keys. In an operating system configured for a non-English language, the keys are placed differently. For example, keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to release space for Ñ/ñ; similarly those for French or Portuguese may have a special key for the character Ç/ç. Keyboards designed for Japanese may have special keys to switch between Japanese and Latin scripts, and the character ¥ (Japanese yen or Chinese yuan currency symbol) instead of \ (<b>backslash,</b> which may {{be replaced by the}} former in some typefaces and codepages). Using a keyboard for alternative languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key does not correspond to the character. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the key, because the standard keyboard layouts do not even share similar characters of different languages.|$|E
500|$|Strings {{delimited by}} single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks {{function}} identically. Both kinds of string use the <b>backslash</b> (\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as [...] "formatted string literals".|$|E
500|$|Evolve {{received}} a largely positive reception from critics upon its initial announcement. It {{was nominated for}} six different awards in the Game Critics Awards, namely Best of Show, Best Original Game, Best Console Game, Best PC Game, Best Action Game and Best Online Multiplayer. It won four of them, and lost the Best Original Game Awards to No Man's Sky and Best PC Game to [...] Evolve was also named the Best Game, Best Console Game Microsoft Xbox, Best PC Game and Best Online Multiplayer Game at Gamescom 2014. Publisher 2K Games stated that these awards indicated that Evolve could become a defining title for both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. However, the DLC controversy caused <b>backslash</b> from customers, and the game was criticized for serving {{as a framework for}} the release of DLC.|$|E

5000|$|The # {{operator}} (known as the [...] "Stringification Operator") converts a token into a string, escaping any quotes or <b>backslashes</b> appropriately.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} number of <b>backslashes</b> {{increase}} from 0 to 1 to 3 to 7 to 15, indicating a 2^n-1 rule for successively nested symbols.|$|R
500|$|Though Quantum Break was {{originally}} announced as a Xbox One exclusive, Microsoft announced in February 2016 {{that the game}} would be released for Windows 10 (Universal Windows Platform) as well, to launch simultaneously with the Xbox One version. Developed internally by Remedy, the PC version would only be released on Windows Store and would require DirectX 12. This created <b>backslash</b> among players, who criticized Microsoft for misleading them into buying a Xbox One by not revealing the PC version's existence when the game was announced. Microsoft's Phil Spencer replied by saying that delivering a game to a broader audience [...] "a good thing" [...] {{and that it could}} increase the game's sales. Lake added that he was [...] "confused" [...] and [...] "baffled" [...] by the responses of the community.|$|E
2500|$|In the Brazilian ABNT2 keyboard, {{the dead}} {{circumflex}} {{has its own}} key together with dead tilde ("shift-~"), near the [...] "Enter" [...] key. The dead breve is hidden over the <b>backslash</b> ("altgr-shift-\") key.|$|E
2500|$|In Unix shells, if an alias {{exists for}} a command, it is {{possible}} to override the alias by surrounding the command with quotes or prefixing it with a <b>backslash.</b> For example, consider the following alias definition: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} programming, leaning toothpick syndrome (LTS) is {{the situation}} in which a quoted expression becomes unreadable because it contains a large number of escape characters, usually <b>backslashes</b> ("\"), to avoid delimiter collision.|$|R
50|$|MySpaceIM uses a {{proprietary}} text-based protocol developed by MySpace. Messages are sent as lists of key/value pairs, separated by <b>backslashes.</b> Logging in involves a challenge/response protocol using the SHA-1 hash function and RC4.|$|R
50|$|Arguments can be quoted using double-quotes. <b>Backslashes</b> {{can be used}} {{to escape}} commas and double-quotes. A single quote at the {{beginning}} of an argument turns off interpretation of code in that argument (similar to LISP).|$|R
2500|$|Percent ( [...] % [...] ): Percent-signs (%) in the command, unless {{escaped with}} <b>backslash</b> (\), are changed into newline characters, and all data {{after the first}} % are sent to the command [...] as {{standard}} input.|$|E
2500|$|To {{define a}} string constant, single quotes (...) are used. To use a single quote {{in a string}} constant, it must be escaped by placing a <b>backslash</b> before it, as 'I\'m so happy'. X# strings are null terminated.|$|E
2500|$|If [...] and [...] are {{distinct}} members of [...] and , then there exists an element [...] such that [...] [...] (Here the <b>backslash</b> symbol {{stands for the}} difference of sets. This property is called the basis exchange property.) ...|$|E
50|$|Vowels and consonants are {{outlined}} in the tables below. The vowels table shows the character used in the article (ex. ī) followed by its IPA value in <b>backslashes</b> (ex. /iː/). See Punjabi phonology for further clarification.|$|R
5000|$|A Perl {{program to}} print an HTML link tag, where the URL and link text {{are stored in}} {{variables}} [...] and [...] respectively, might look like this. Notice the use of <b>backslashes</b> to escape the quoted double-quote characters: ...|$|R
500|$|Raw string varieties, {{denoted by}} prefixing the string literal with an r. Escape {{sequences}} are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal <b>backslashes</b> are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. Compare [...] "@-quoting" [...] in C#.|$|R
2500|$|In this notation, {{the use of}} a {{vertical}} bar as delimiter indicates that the argument following it is the [...] "parameter" [...] (as defined above), while the <b>backslash</b> indicates that it is the modular angle. The use of a semicolon implies that the argument preceding it is the sine of the amplitude: ...|$|E
2500|$|YAML version 1.2 is a superset of JSON; prior {{versions}} were [...] "not strictly compatible". For example, escaping a slash (/) with a <b>backslash</b> (\) {{is valid}} in JSON, {{but was not}} valid in YAML. (This is common practice when injecting JSON into HTML to protect against cross-site scripting attacks.) Nonetheless, many YAML parsers can natively parse the output from many JSON encoders.|$|E
2500|$|The slash {{is used as}} {{the path}} {{component}} separator in many computer operating systems (e.g., Unix's pictures/image.png). In Unix and Unix-like systems, such as macOS and Linux, the slash is also used for the volume root directory (e.g., the initial slash in /usr/john/pictures). Confusion of the slash with the <b>backslash</b> [...] largely arises {{from the use of}} the latter as the path component separator in the widely used MS-DOS, Windows, and OS/2 systems.|$|E
5000|$|Many game {{walkthrough}} guides come {{as part of}} a basic [...]txt file; this file often {{contains the}} name of the game in ASCII art. Such as below, word art is created using <b>backslashes</b> and other ASCII values in order to create the illusion of 3D.|$|R
5000|$|Extreme {{examples}} {{occur when}} these are combined - Uniform Naming Convention paths begin with , and thus an escaped regular expression matching a UNC name begins with 8 <b>backslashes,</b> , due to needing {{to escape the}} string and the regular expression. Using raw strings reduces this to 4 (escaping in the regular expression), as in C# [...]|$|R
5000|$|Beyond {{syntactic}} {{requirements of}} C/C++, implicit concatenation {{is a form}} of syntactic sugar, making it simpler to split string literals across several lines, avoiding the need for line continuation (via <b>backslashes)</b> and allowing one to add comments to parts of strings. For example in Python, one can comment a regular expression in this way: ...|$|R
2500|$|Note: It is common, {{especially}} in Spanish and Italian, {{to represent the}} alveolar trill with [...] and the alveolar flap with [...] In Spanish, too, [...] is used to represent the palatal fricative against the semivowel [...] It has been proposed to use [...] for the alveolar flap, in which case [...] {{can be used to}} represent the trill (as its equivalent in the IPA system), and [...] for the palatal fricative, keeping in this way the policy of using one letter per one IPA symbol (and a <b>backslash</b> for alternative symbols).|$|E
2500|$|TeX {{commands}} commonly {{start with}} a <b>backslash</b> and are grouped with curly braces. Almost all of TeX's syntactic properties can be changed on the fly, which makes TeX input hard to parse by anything but TeX itself. TeX is a macro- and token-based language: many commands, including most user-defined ones, are expanded on the fly until only unexpandable tokens remain, which are then executed. Expansion itself is practically free from side effects. Tail recursion of macros takes no memory, and if-then-else constructs are available. This makes TeX a Turing-complete language even at the expansion level. The system {{can be divided into}} four levels: in the first, characters are read from the input file and assigned a category code (sometimes called [...] "catcode", for short). Combinations of a <b>backslash</b> (actually, any character of category zero) followed by letters (characters of category 11) or a single other character are replaced by a control-sequence token. In this sense, this stage is like lexical analysis, although it does not form numbers from digits. In the next stage, expandable control sequences (such as conditionals or defined macros) are replaced by their replacement text. The input for the third stage is then a stream of characters (including ones with special meaning) and unexpandable control sequences (typically assignments and visual commands). Here characters get assembled into a paragraph. TeX's paragraph breaking algorithm works by optimizing breakpoints over the whole paragraph. The fourth stage breaks the vertical list of lines and other material into pages.|$|E
2500|$|In the 18th century, {{the mark}} was {{generally}} known in English as the [...] "oblique". The variant [...] "oblique stroke" [...] eventually developed into [...] "stroke", the common British {{name for the}} mark. In the 19th and early 20th century, it was also widely known as the [...] "shilling mark" [...] or [...] "solidus", from its use as the currency sign for the shilling. The name [...] "slash" [...] is a recent development, first attested in American English , but has gained wide currency through its use in computing, a context where it is sometimes even used in British English in preference to the usual name [...] "stroke". Clarifying terms such as [...] "forward slash" [...] have been coined owing to widespread use of Microsoft's DOS and Windows operating systems, which use the <b>backslash</b> extensively.|$|E
50|$|A part notated with figured bass {{consists}} of a bass line notated with notes on a musical staff plus added numbers and accidentals (or in some cases (<b>back)slashes</b> added to a number) beneath the staff to indicate what intervals above the bass notes should be played, and therefore which inversions of which chords are to be played.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the server}} {{has the same}} {{information}} as the client, the response can be checked by performing the same calculation. In the example given above the result is formed as follows, where [...] represents a function used to calculate an MD5 hash, <b>backslashes</b> represent a continuation and the quotes shown are not used in the calculation.|$|R
5000|$|For example, in Python, raw strings are {{preceded by}} an [...] or [...] - compare [...] with [...] (though, a Python raw string cannot end {{in an odd}} number of <b>backslashes).</b> Python 2 also distinguishes two types of strings: 8-bit ASCII ("bytes") strings (the default), {{explicitly}} indicated with a [...] or [...] prefix, and Unicode strings, indicated with a [...] or [...] prefix.|$|R
