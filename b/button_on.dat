5|$|The game is {{displayed}} on a black-and-white television screen, and the tanks are controlled by two joysticks each. Pushing both joysticks moves the player's tank forward, and pulling them both back causes the tank to stop. Pulling them in different directions or amounts causes the tank to turn in place or while moving, respectively. A <b>button</b> <b>on</b> {{the top of the}} right joystick fires a shell.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} a skeet shooter who {{is shooting}} clay pigeons. By pressing the <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the controller, a clay pigeon is sent out and pressing the button again will shoot; moving the joystick changes the gun's angle. A point is earned if the bullet hits. Difficulty varieties adjust {{the speed of}} the pigeons.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume control}} of Jeremy, a sword-wielding, melee-focused character, and Alysa, who uses {{crossbows}} to deliver ranged attacks. The game {{can be played}} as a single player game, in which the player alternates between controlling Jeremy and Alysa, or as a local co-op game, in which two players play cooperatively, with one controlling each character. Blood Knights does not support online co-op. Like most hack and slash games, the control scheme is minimal. When controlling Jeremy, players can chain attacks using one button (the X <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the Xbox 360), and can use a number of special attacks that have a cooldown timer, including a heavy blow, a whirlwind attack, and a power that draws distant enemies to Jeremy. While controlling Alysa, the game functions as a twin-stick shooter, in which movement is controlled by one thumbstick or set of keys, and firing weapons {{is controlled by the}} other thumbstick or another set of keys. Alysa also has special attacks, including the ability to fire flaming arrows and a grenade attack. In single player gameplay, the player can switch between Jeremy and Alysa by pressing a button (the Y <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the Xbox 360). Players can transfer health, in the form of blood, between the two playable characters, healing one {{at the expense of the}} other.|$|E

Senior NCO's mess jackets are the same except that the mess jacket has a shawl collar and there are three <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> {{each side of the}} jacket rather than four, and rank stripes are worn on the right upper arm, and the <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> the cuffs are smaller (female Senior NCO's mess jackets do not have cuff buttons). A royal blue waistcoat is worn with both variations.|$|R
5|$|Released {{as part of}} a shift by Microsoft towards regular yearly major updates for its {{software}} platforms and services, Windows 8.1 aims to address complaints of Windows 8 users and reviewers on launch. Visible enhancements include an improved Start screen, additional snap views, additional bundled apps, tighter OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) integration, Internet Explorer 11, a Bing-powered unified search system, restoration of a visible Start <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the taskbar, and the ability to restore the previous behavior of opening the user's desktop on login instead of the Start screen. Windows 8.1 also added support for such emerging technologies as high-resolution displays, 3D printing, Wi-Fi Direct, and Miracast streaming, as well as the ReFS file system.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is {{the first}} mass {{production}} car manufactured by Hyundai to include the warning sound system. In 2010 the carmaker {{decided to have a}} <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the Sonata Hybrid's instrument panel to turn the VESS on and off, but after the enactment of the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010, signed into law by President Obama in early 2011, and learning that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would not allow such switches to avoid the noise device to be turned off, Hyundai decided not to install the button, and the first Sonata Hybrids destined for the U.S. market had to be altered to remove the switch.|$|E
5|$|The Leaf's {{electric}} warning sound had to {{be removed}} for cars delivered in the U.K., as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am, and the Leaf's audible warning system does not allow for such temporary deactivation. For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system is enabled by default, though a <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the dash permits drivers to disable the system until the next time the car is switched on.|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{arranging}} the buttons in B-Griff order {{goes back to}} a musician named Franz Walter. The oldest known and still usable instrument dates from 1874. The first instruments had fewer <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> the treble side - 46, 49, and later 52 <b>Buttons</b> <b>on</b> three rows.|$|R

5|$|The girl can {{stabilize}} wobbling dishes {{by pressing}} the <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the controller. If a plate falls, the player {{is able to}} capture it if the girl touches it before it hits the ground, and a new one appears {{at the top of}} the pole. The number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level; there are six on the easiest setting, and ten on the hardest. The player loses if they let four dishes hit the ground.|$|E
5|$|In the game's primary single-player mode, titled GH Live {{within the}} game, the player completes songs while {{experiencing}} full-motion video {{taken from the}} first-person perspective of a band's lead guitarist. The video includes shots of the audience and the band members. As the player performs the songs, the audience responds positively to good performances when few mistakes are made. If the player makes several mistakes in a row, the audience will become critical and start to jeer at the performer. To win back the crowd, the player can either match more notes correctly, or can use collected Hero Power to rapidly regain their interest. Hero Power, replacing Star Power from previous Guitar Hero games, is collected by correctly playing marked series of notes on the track; Hero Power can be accumulated, marked as on-screen guitar picks next to the track, to be used at later times. The player can release Hero Power for a limited time by either tilting the guitar controller upward or hitting a special <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the controller.|$|E
5|$|The Magnavox Odyssey is {{the first}} {{commercial}} home video game console. It was developed by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer at Sanders Associates and released by Magnavox in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year. The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box which connects to a television set and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. It is capable of displaying three square dots on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played, and with no sound capabilities. Players place plastic overlays on the screen to create visuals, and {{the one or two}} players for each game control their dots with the three knobs and one <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the controller in accordance with the rules given for the game. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia {{to go along with the}} games, and a peripheral controller—the first video game light gun—was sold separately.|$|E

5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing a <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E
5|$|Following the pitstops {{and safety}} car deployment, Petrov had gained sixth place while Barrichello, Alguersuari, Rosberg and Maldonado {{were in the}} {{remaining}} point scoring positions. Schumacher and Webber, who had contested second place before the safety car, resumed their fight as the race resumed on lap 61. Barrichello was passed by Rosberg and Alguersuari before Massa, {{who had been in}} eleventh place, overtook both Williams cars for ninth. Kobayashi lost fifth place to Petrov, and Maldonado retired by spinning off on the wet track at turn two. Webber, passing Schumacher using DRS, cut the chicane on lap 64 and ceded the position back to avoid a penalty. Button passed Webber, after he again cut the chicane, and Schumacher on the same lap, and gained second place. As Button began catching race leader Vettel, Webber overtook Schumacher for third place on lap 67. On the same lap di Resta retired because of a puncture, and Massa gained eighth position from Alguersuari. The fastest lap of the race was set by <b>Button</b> <b>on</b> lap 69, setting a time of 1:16.956 as he was closing to Vettel for the race lead.|$|E
5|$|One lap later, Daniil Kvyat {{suffered}} a heavy impact at the penultimate corner, causing another safety car period. Both Hamilton and Vettel used this to change tyres again, as did <b>Button</b> <b>on</b> lap 45. The safety car {{came back in}} {{at the end of}} lap 46, with the order being: Rosberg, Hamilton, Verstappen, Vettel, Alonso, Pérez, Button and Maldonado. At the restart, Verstappen tried to move past Hamilton but failed and was in turn overtaken by Vettel. On lap 48, Nico Rosberg lost the lead to Hamilton after sliding off track due to wheelspin in his rear tyres. The German later declared that his mistake was caused by a strong gust of wind. Hamilton soon opened up a gap to his teammate, while Jenson Button moved up into sixth ahead of Alonso on lap 50, but lost the position again to Sainz {{before the end of the}} race. His teammate Alonso had been running fifth, but a loss of power from his engine moved him down the order to eventually finish eleventh. In the closing laps, Vettel edged closer to Rosberg in second, but was unable to overtake. This meant that Hamilton, who crossed the line as race winner, also took his third career championship title, with both Vettel and Rosberg now too far behind.|$|E

5|$|The PlayStation 3 {{version of}} Flow {{features}} enhanced visuals and three additional playable organisms: {{one that can}} move with a short burst of speed, one that can paralyze other creatures, and one that lunges toward its prey's weak point. The worm creature from the original game was given {{the ability to move}} faster, while the jellyfish may now create a vortex to attract small creatures. These special moves are activated by hitting any <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the controller. When the player reaches the bottom plane with each creature, the next creature type is unlocked and becomes selectable {{at the beginning of the}} game. The PlayStation 3 version features a multiplayer mode for up to four players; a game in progress can be joined at any time, players may play different creatures if they desire so. The PlayStation Portable version contains all of the features introduced by PlayStation 3 version, but reduces the size of each plane. On November 20, 2007, the PlayStation 3 version received an add-on pack that allows players joining a multiplayer game to select their creatures. The pack also includes new enemies, food types, and a playable creature with a shield ability.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock {{is similar}} to {{previous}} titles in the series. The player hits notes as they scroll towards {{the bottom of the}} screen in time with music to maintain their performance and earn points. To hit notes using the guitar controller, the player hits the strum bar while holding down the corresponding colored fret buttons. If the player uses the standard controller instead of the guitar controller, the correct buttons need to be pressed, but the player is not required to strum. Notes can be sustained, during which the fret button is held until the note is complete, and they can also form two- to four-note chords. The game simulates hammer-ons and pull-offs for sections with a rapid series of notes, allowing the player to forgo strumming on specifically marked notes. Missing a note causes the performance meter to drop. When the meter drops too low, the player fails the song, represented in-game by the band being booed off the stage. A string of 10 consecutive correct notes earns a multiplier to increase the player's score, which can occur up to four times. Special sections, marked by starred notes, can be used to build Star Power. When the player has enough Star Power, they can activate it and further double the scoring multiplier either by tilting the guitar controller vertically or by pressing a specific <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the controller. While Star Power enabled, the performance meter increases more quickly when a correct note is hit, and missing notes have a decreased penalty. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock contains four difficulty levels: Easy, which uses three of the fret buttons; Medium, which makes use of four of the fret buttons; Hard, which uses all five fret buttons; and Expert, which adds no new fret buttons, but increases the number of notes and the general difficulty.|$|E
