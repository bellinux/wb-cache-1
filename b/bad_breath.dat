5|$|But from {{whichever}} it is made, {{whether from}} oats, barley or wheat, it harms {{the head and}} the stomach, it causes <b>bad</b> <b>breath</b> and ruins the teeth, it fills the stomach with bad fumes, {{and as a result}} anyone who drinks it along with wine becomes drunk quickly; but it does have the property of facilitating urination and makes one's flesh white and smooth.|$|E
6000|$|She {{longed to}} see Guy Pollock, for the {{confirming}} of the brethren in the faith. But Kennicott's dominance was heavy upon her. She could not determine {{whether she was}} checked by fear or him, or by inertia--by dislike of the emotional labor of the [...] "scenes" [...] which {{would be involved in}} asserting independence. She was like the revolutionist at fifty: not afraid of death, but bored by the probability of bad steaks and <b>bad</b> <b>breaths</b> and sitting up all night on windy barricades.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He's been consumptive for a {{long time}} past,' said Mr. Roker, 'and he's taken wery <b>bad</b> in the <b>breath</b> to-night. The doctor said, six months ago, that nothing but change of air could save him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>bad</b> no <b>breath,</b> no being, but in hers; [...] She was his voice; he did {{not speak}} to her, [...] But trembled on her words; she was his sight. [...] For his eye {{followed}} hers, and saw with hers, [...] Which colored all his objects; he had ceased [...] To live within himself; she was his life, [...] The ocean to the river of his thoughts, [...] Which terminated all; upon a tone, [...] A touch of hers, his blood would ebb and flow, [...] And his cheek change tempestuously--his heart [...] Unknowing of its cause of agony." ...|$|R
5|$|Oral hygiene is the {{practice}} of keeping the mouth clean and {{is a means of}} preventing dental caries, gingivitis, periodontal disease, <b>bad</b> <b>breath,</b> and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E
25|$|Tonsillectomy may be {{indicated}} if <b>bad</b> <b>breath</b> due to tonsillar stones persists despite other measures.|$|E
25|$|Acne-form {{dermatitis}} {{and other}} forms of skin disease may also be seen, as well as mucous hypersecretion in the lungs. Asthma and rhinitis may worsen. Rarely, tongue disorder, aphten, <b>bad</b> <b>breath,</b> and obstipation occur.|$|E
50|$|One Midwinter, when Ingjald and Alf {{were six}} years old, {{many people had}} {{assembled}} at Uppsala for the sacrifices. Alf and Ingjald played, but Ingjald {{found that he was}} the weaker boy and became so angry that he almost started to cry (which was strange because people named Ingjald were known to be stronger than average). His foster-brother Gautvid led him to his foster-father Svipdag the Blind and told Svipdag about Ingjald's lack of manliness and strength. Svipdag said that it was a shame and the next day he gave Ingjald a roasted wolf's heart to eat. From that day, Ingjald became a very ferocious person and had a <b>bad</b> disposition and <b>breath.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Duncan Dhu made {{haste to}} bring out the pair of pipes that was his {{principal}} possession, and to set before his guests a mutton-ham and a bottle of that drink which they call Athole brose, and which is made of old whiskey, strained honey and sweet cream, slowly beaten together in the right order and proportion. The two enemies were still on the very breach of a quarrel; but down they sat, one upon each side of the peat fire, with a mighty show of politeness. Maclaren pressed them to taste his mutton-ham and [...] "the wife's brose," [...] reminding them the wife was out of Athole and had a name far and wide for her skill in that confection. But Robin put aside these hospitalities as <b>bad</b> for the <b>breath.</b>|$|R
50|$|Marr's writing {{career began}} in the early 1970s when he wrote three popular books for {{children}} on health issues (The Good Drug and the <b>Bad</b> Drug, A <b>Breath</b> of Air and a Breath of Smoke, and The Food You Eat). A New York Times article featured The Good Drug and the Bad Drug and a special teacher's guide was developed for city schools. The book was later featured in a 1971 NBC-TV special on drugs hosted by Bill Cosby, in which Marr appeared. Marr went on to co-author a thriller about a pneumonic plague outbreak in New York, inspired by research he'd done as the city's epidemiologist. Written with Gwyneth Cravens and published in 1978, The Black Death was later filmed by CBS as a movie of the week under the title Quiet Killer.|$|R
25|$|Food debris, desquamated {{epithelial}} cells and bacteria often form a visible tongue coating. This coating {{has been identified}} as a major contributing factor in <b>bad</b> <b>breath</b> (halitosis), which can be managed by using a tongue cleaner.|$|E
25|$|Dental caries {{can also}} cause <b>bad</b> <b>breath</b> and foul tastes. In highly progressed cases, an {{infection}} can spread from the tooth to the surrounding soft tissues. Complications such as cavernous sinus thrombosis and Ludwig angina can be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Halitosis (<b>bad</b> <b>breath)</b> {{is often}} stated to be {{a symptom of}} chronic rhinosinusitis; however, gold {{standard}} breath analysis techniques have not been applied. Theoretically, there are several possible mechanisms of both objective and subjective halitosis that may be involved.|$|E
5000|$|In 1940 the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York {{seized a}} {{shipment}} of the devices as misbranded. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's subsequent Drugs and Devices Court Case Notice of Judgment (captioned [...] "U.S. v. 67 Sets of Dr. Young's Rectal Dilators and 83 Packages of Dr. Young's Piloment") the product's labeling claimed it corrected constipation, promoted more refreshing sleep, and could relieve foul <b>breath,</b> <b>bad</b> taste in the mouth, sallow skin, acne, anemia, lassitude, mental hebetude, insomnia, anorexia, headaches, diarrhea, hemorrhoids, flatulence, indigestion, nervousness, irritability, cold extremities, and numerous other ailments. The instructions warned, [...] "Do not neglect to use your Dilators... It is advisable to use them occasionally as a precautionary measure. You need have no fear of using them too much".|$|R
60|$|Our party {{walked all}} through the house, and then the nobility escorted {{them all over the}} grounds, and finally brought them back to the palace about half-past two o'clock to breakfast. They called it breakfast, but we would have called it luncheon. It {{consisted}} of two kinds of wine; tea, bread, cheese, and cold meats, and was served on the centre-tables in the reception room and the verandahs--anywhere that was convenient; there was no ceremony. It was a sort of picnic. I had heard before that we were to breakfast there, but Blucher said he believed Baker's boy had suggested it to his Imperial Highness. I think not--though it would be like him. Baker's boy is the famine-breeder of the ship. He is always hungry. They say he goes about the state-rooms when the passengers are out, and eats up all the soap. And they say he eats oakum. They say he will eat any thing he can get between meals, but he prefers oakum. He does not like oakum for dinner, but he likes it for a lunch, at odd hours, or any thing that way. It makes him very disagreeable, because it makes his <b>breath</b> <b>bad,</b> and keeps his teeth all stuck up with tar. Baker's boy may have suggested the breakfast, but I hope he did not. It went off well, anyhow. The illustrious host moved about from place to place, and helped to destroy the provisions and keep the conversation lively, and the Grand Duchess talked with the verandah parties and such as had satisfied their appetites and straggled out from the reception room.|$|R
25|$|Larger tonsilloliths {{may cause}} {{multiple}} symptoms, including recurrent halitosis, which frequently accompanies a tonsil infection, sore throat, white debris, a bad taste {{in the back}} of the throat, difficulty swallowing, ear ache, and tonsil swelling. A medical study conducted in 2007 found an association between tonsilloliths and <b>bad</b> <b>breath</b> in patients with a certain type of recurrent tonsillitis. Among those with <b>bad</b> <b>breath,</b> 75% of the subjects had tonsilloliths, while only 6% of subjects with normal halitometry values (normal breath) had tonsilloliths. A foreign body sensation may also exist {{in the back of}} the throat. The condition may also be an asymptomatic condition, with detection upon palpating a hard intratonsillar or submucosal mass.|$|E
25|$|Protruding tonsilloliths {{may feel}} like foreign objects {{lodged in the}} tonsil crypt. They may be a {{nuisance}} and difficult to remove, but are usually not harmful. They {{are one of the}} causes of halitosis (<b>bad</b> <b>breath)</b> and always give off a putrid smell.|$|E
25|$|Larger tonsil stones {{may require}} removal by {{curettage}} (scooping) or otherwise, although thorough irrigation {{will still be}} required afterwards to effectively wash out smaller pieces. Larger lesions may require local excision, although these treatments may not completely help the <b>bad</b> <b>breath</b> issues that are often associated with this condition.|$|E
25|$|Triclosan, an {{antibacterial}} agent, is {{a common}} toothpaste ingredient in the United Kingdom. Triclosan or zinc chloride prevent gingivitis and, according to the American Dental Association, helps reduce tartar and <b>bad</b> <b>breath.</b> A 2006 review of clinical research concluded there was evidence for the effectiveness of 0.30% triclosan in reducing plaque and gingivitis.|$|E
25|$|Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), {{also known}} as acid reflux, is a {{long-term}} condition where stomach contents come back up into the esophagus resulting in either symptoms or complications. Symptoms include the taste of acid {{in the back of}} the mouth, heartburn, <b>bad</b> <b>breath,</b> chest pain, vomiting, breathing problems, and wearing away of the teeth. Complications include esophagitis, esophageal strictures, and Barrett's esophagus.|$|E
25|$|Dipping tobacco, {{commonly}} referred to as snuff, is also put in the mouth, but it is a flavored powder. it is placed between the cheek and gum. Dipping tobacco doesn't need to be chewed for the nicotine to be absorbed into your body. First-time users of these products often become nauseated and dizzy. Long-term effects include <b>bad</b> <b>breath,</b> yellowed teeth, and an increased risk of oral cancer.|$|E
25|$|Used as {{a ritual}} {{beverage}} in the Eleusinian Mysteries, kykeon {{was also a}} popular beverage, especially in the countryside: Theophrastus, in his Characters, describes a boorish peasant as having drunk much kykeon and inconveniencing the Assembly with his <b>bad</b> <b>breath.</b> It also {{had a reputation as}} a good digestive, and as such, in Peace, Hermes recommends it to the main character who has eaten too much dried fruit.|$|E
25|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} ORS is excessive thoughts of having offensive body odor(s) which are detectable to others. The individual may {{report that the}} odor comes from: the nose and/or mouth, i.e. halitosis (<b>bad</b> <b>breath),</b> the anus, the genitals, the skin generally, or specifically the groin, armpits or feet. The source(s) of the supposed odor may also change over time. There are also some who are unsure of the exact origin of the odor. The odor is typically reported to be continuously present. The character of the odor may be reported as similar to bodily substances, e.g. feces, flatus, urine, sweat, vomitus, semen, vaginal secretions; or alternatively {{it may be an}} unnatural, non-human or chemical odor, e.g. ammonia, detergent, rotten onions, burnt rags, candles, garbage, burning fish, medicines, old cheese. Again, the reported character of the odor complaint may change over time. Halitosis appears to be the most common manifestation of ORS, with 75% complaining of <b>bad</b> <b>breath,</b> alone or in combination with other odors. The next most common complaint was sweat (60%).|$|E
25|$|Gum chewing is {{regarded}} as a helpful way to cure halitosis (<b>bad</b> <b>breath).</b> Chewing gum not only helps to add freshness to breath but can aid in removing food particles and bacteria associated with <b>bad</b> <b>breath</b> from teeth. It does this by stimulating saliva, which essentially washes out the mouth. Chewing sugar-free gum for 20 minutes after a meal helps prevent tooth decay, according to the American Dental Association, because the act of chewing the sugar-free gum produces saliva to wash away bacteria, which protects teeth. Chewing gum after a meal replaces brushing and flossing, if that's not possible, to prevent tooth decay and increase saliva production. Chewing gum can also help with the lack of saliva or xerostomia since it naturally stimulates saliva production. Saliva is made of chemicals, such as organic molecules, inorganic ions and macromolecules. 0.5% of saliva deals with dental health, since tooth enamel is made of calcium phosphate, those inorganic ions in saliva help repair the teeth and keep them in good condition. The pH of saliva is neutral, which having a pH of 7 allows it to remineralize tooth enamel. Falling below a pH of 5.5 (which is acidic) causes the saliva to demineralize the teeth.|$|E
25|$|When wisdom teeth {{communicate}} with the mouth, the most common symptom is localized pain, swelling and bleeding of the tissue overlying the tooth. This tissue is called the operculum and the disorder called pericoronitis which means inflammation around the crown of the tooth. Low grade chronic periodontitis commonly occurs on either the wisdom tooth or the second molar, causing less obvious symptoms such as <b>bad</b> <b>breath</b> and bleeding from the gums. The teeth can also remain asymptomatic (pain free), even with disease. As the teeth near the mouth during normal development, people sometimes report mild pressure of other symptoms similar to teething.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of raw feeding {{believe that}} the natural diet of raw meat, bones, and organs is nutritionally {{superior}} to cooked meat and commercial pet food. They argue that a careful plan of a raw diet gives the animal numerous health benefits, including a healthier coat and cleaner teeth and elimination of <b>bad</b> <b>breath.</b> Critics of raw feeding assert {{that the risk of}} nutritional imbalance, intestinal perforations and foodborne illnesses posed by the handling and feeding of raw meat and bones outweigh any benefits. The assertion that raw feeding is inherently better because it is natural has also been criticized by proponents of commercial pet foods.|$|E
500|$|Common {{marginal}} gingivitis {{in response}} to subgingival plaque is usually a painless condition. However, an acute form of gingivitis/periodontitis, termed acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), can develop, often suddenly. It is associated with severe periodontal pain, bleeding gums, [...] "punched out" [...] ulceration, loss of the interdental papillae, and possibly also halitosis (<b>bad</b> <b>breath)</b> and a bad taste. Predisposing factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, malnutrition, psychological stress, and immunosuppression. This condition is not contagious, but multiple cases may simultaneously occur in populations who share the same risk factors (such as students in a dormitory {{during a period of}} examination). ANUG is treated over several visits, first with debridement of the necrotic gingiva, homecare with hydrogen peroxide mouthwash, analgesics and, when the pain has subsided sufficiently, cleaning below the gumline, both professionally and at home. Antibiotics are not indicated in ANUG management unless there is underlying systemic disease.|$|E
500|$|A common local {{belief is}} that the durian is harmful when eaten with coffee or {{alcoholic}} beverages. The latter belief {{can be traced back}} at least to the 18th century when Rumphius stated that one should not drink alcohol after eating durians as it will cause indigestion and <b>bad</b> <b>breath.</b> In 1929, J. D. Gimlette wrote in his Malay Poisons and Charm Cures that the durian fruit must not be eaten with brandy. In 1981, J. R. Croft wrote in his Bombacaceae: In Handbooks of the Flora of Papua New Guinea that [...] "a feeling of morbidity" [...] often follows the consumption of alcohol too soon after eating durian. Several medical investigations on the validity of this belief have been conducted with varying conclusions, though a study by the University of Tsukuba finds the fruit's high sulphur content inhibits the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase, causing a 70% reduction of the ability to clear toxins from the body.|$|E

2500|$|Tonsilloliths {{may produce}} no symptoms, [...] {{or they may}} be {{associated}} with <b>bad</b> <b>breath,</b> or produce pain when swallowing.|$|E
2500|$|In modern times, {{commercial}} advertising pressures {{have altered the}} public's attitude towards problems such as halitosis, which have taken on greater negative psychosocial sequelae as a result. For example, in the United States, a poll reported that 55–75 million citizens consider <b>bad</b> <b>breath</b> a [...] "principal concern" [...] during social encounters.|$|E
2500|$|The Slitheen {{disguise}} {{themselves by}} fitting into the skins of their victims, using compression fields {{created by a}} collar worn around their necks to squeeze their huge size into a slightly smaller space. Initially the compression ratio was limited, so the disguises tended to be obese people. This issue was overcome by new technology {{by the time of}} The Lost Boy, in which the skins of thinner people were used (by the time of [...] "From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love" [...] short people could also be used). The exchange of gases that compression entails also builds up within the acquired skin, causing very loud flatulence in humans (the expelled gas smells like <b>bad</b> <b>breath,</b> which the Doctor noted was a form of calcium decay—though, in reality, bacteria that cause tooth decay are different from those that cause <b>bad</b> <b>breath).</b> This side-effect is also overcome by the newer technology in The Lost Boy.|$|E
2500|$|Garlic {{is known}} to cause <b>bad</b> <b>breath</b> (halitosis) and body odor, {{described}} as a pungent [...] "garlicky" [...] smell to sweat. This is caused by allyl methyl sulfide (AMS). AMS is a volatile liquid which is absorbed into the blood during the metabolism of garlic-derived sulfur compounds; from the blood it travels to the lungs (and {{from there to the}} mouth, causing bad breath; see garlic breath) and skin, where it is exuded through skin pores. Washing the skin with soap is only a partial and imperfect solution to the smell. Studies have shown sipping milk {{at the same time as}} consuming garlic can significantly neutralize <b>bad</b> <b>breath.</b> Mixing garlic with milk in the mouth before swallowing reduced the odor better than drinking milk afterward. Plain water, mushrooms and basil may also reduce the odor; the mix of fat and water found in milk, however, was the most effective.|$|E
2500|$|GERD may be {{difficult}} to detect in infants and children, since they cannot describe what they are feeling and indicators must be observed. Symptoms may vary from typical adult symptoms. [...] GERD in children may cause repeated vomiting, effortless spitting up, coughing, and other respiratory problems, such as wheezing. Inconsolable crying, refusing food, crying for food and then pulling off the bottle or breast only to cry for it again, failure to gain adequate weight, <b>bad</b> <b>breath,</b> and burping are also common. Children may have one symptom or many; no single symptom is universal in all children with GERD.|$|E
