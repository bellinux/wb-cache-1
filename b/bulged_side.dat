60|$|It is {{necessary}} {{that the position}} occupied by the Allies should be perfectly comprehended, {{in order to understand}} the battles and operations which subsequently took place. It may be described as a triangle with one <b>bulging</b> <b>side.</b> The apex of the triangle were the heights on the seashore, known as the Marine Heights.|$|R
50|$|In {{the figure}} {{it can be}} seen that the {{compressive}} loading (indicated by the arrow) has caused deformation in the cylinder so that the original shape (dashed lines) has changed (deformed) into one with <b>bulging</b> <b>sides.</b> The <b>sides</b> <b>bulge</b> because the material, although strong enough to not crack or otherwise fail, is not strong enough to support the load without change, thus the material is forced out laterally. Internal forces (in this case at right angles to the deformation) resist the applied load.|$|R
50|$|Spišská Nová Ves is {{a popular}} tourist {{attraction}} today, both because of the town itself {{and because of the}} unique natural beauty of the nearby Slovak Paradise mountains. The core of the town is a lens-shaped square (a square with <b>bulging</b> <b>sides),</b> typical of medieval towns. It is a cultural, administrative and business centre of the Spiš region, and is rich in art and historical monuments.|$|R
50|$|It is {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} Aldabrachelys by a massive, flattened or depressed carapace, <b>bulging</b> <b>sides</b> of the carapace, short gulars, top of the nasal aperture {{is higher than the}} top of orbits, diverging quadrates, broad postorbitals, and a very large processus vomerinus dorsalis. It also had an unusually thick, strong carapace, possibly an adaptation to heavy predation. It seems to have been predominantly a grazer of meadows and wetlands.|$|R
60|$|Yaqui {{left the}} gulch and clambered {{up over a}} jumble of {{weathered}} slides and traced a slow course along {{the base of the}} giant wall. He looked up and seemed to select a point for ascent. It was the last place in that mountainside where Gale would have thought climbing possible. Before him the wall rose, leaning over him, shutting out the light, a dark mighty mountain mass. Innumerable cracks and crevices and caves roughened the <b>bulging</b> <b>sides</b> of dark rock.|$|R
500|$|The Charles Martel {{group of}} battleships all {{shared the same}} layout for their main and {{secondary}} armament—a design that minimised the cramped upper decks produced by the pronounced tumblehome favoured by French designers, and capitalised on the <b>bulging</b> <b>sides</b> of the vessels. The bow and stern turrets had only a single gun and were placed uncomfortably close to the extremities of the ship in Jauréguiberry because she was some [...] shorter than the other ships in the group. The single turrets of the secondary armament were mounted on the ship's beam, while the [...] guns were mounted in four twin turrets sited symmetrically behind and outboard of the main gun turrets.|$|R
2500|$|The K-1200 K-MAX [...] "aerial truck" [...] is the world's first {{helicopter}} specifically designed, tested, {{and certified}} for repetitive external lift operations and vertical reference flight (Kaman received IFR Certification in 1999), an important feature for external load work. Other rotorcraft used for these tasks are adapted from general-purpose helicopters, or those intended to primarily carry passengers or internal cargo. The K-MAX can lift {{almost twice as}} much as the Bell 205 using a different version of the same engine. The aircraft's narrow, wedge-shaped profile and <b>bulging</b> <b>side</b> windows give the pilot {{a good view of the}} load looking out from either side of the aircraft.|$|R

500|$|After {{returning}} to Philadelphia on 1 January 1931, Wyoming {{was placed on}} reduced commission. Under {{the terms of the}} London Naval Treaty signed the previous year, Wyoming was to be demilitarized. During the demilitarization process, her anti-torpedo <b>bulges,</b> <b>side</b> armor, and half of her main battery guns were removed. She was back in service by May, and on the 29th, she took on a crew of midshipmen from Annapolis for a training cruise to Europe, which began on 5 June. While en route on 15 June, Wyoming rescued the disabled submarine [...] and took it under tow to Queenstown, Northern Ireland. While in Europe, she stopped in Copenhagen, Denmark, Greenock, Scotland, Cadiz, Spain, and Gibraltar. The ship was back in Hampton Roads on 13 August; while on the cruise, Wyoming was reclassified as [...] "AG-17", to reflect her new role as a training ship.|$|R
60|$|Don, as befitted {{a gentleman}} {{and the leader}} of the {{greatest}} pack in the West, had to be fed by hand. I believe he would rather had starved than have demeaned himself by fighting. Starved he certainly would have, if Jim had thrown meat indiscriminately to the ground. Sounder asserted his rights and preferred large portions at a time. Jude begged with great solemn eyes but was no slouch at eating for all her gentleness. Ranger, because of imperfectly developed teeth rendering mastication difficult, had to have his share cut into very small pieces. As for Moze--well, great dogs have their faults as do great men--he never got enough meat; he would fight even poor crippled Jude, and steal even from the pups; when he had gotten all Jim would give him, and all he could snatch, he would growl away with <b>bulging</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R

5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the 1930 London Naval Treaty, Wyoming was to be demilitarized and {{converted}} into a training ship. During the demilitarization process, her anti-torpedo <b>bulges,</b> <b>side</b> armor, and half of her main battery guns were removed. Wyoming was modernized at Norfolk Navy Yard from 12 January to 3 April 1944; the reconstruction removed the last of her three 12-inch gun turrets, and replaced them with four twin and two single enclosed mounts for 5-inch/38 caliber guns. New fire control radars were also installed; these modifications allowed Wyoming to train anti-aircraft gunners with the most modern equipment they would use while in combat with the fleet. Modifications to Arkansas during World War II were kept to a minimum. In 1942, Arkansas received a new tripod foremast and bridgework, along with more anti-aircraft guns throughout the war. By 1945, she carried nine quadruple 40 mm Bofors mounts and twenty-eight 20 mm Oerlikons, and the number of 3-inch guns had been increased to ten.|$|R
60|$|Life {{and death}} were powerfully {{suggested}} to him. Many a time had he {{seen such a}} craft breasting the waves of the broad Saint Lawrence, when every dip of the bow, every bend of the taper masts, every rattle of the ropes, and every mellow shout of the seamen, told of vigorous life and energy; and now, the broken masts and yards tipped and fringed with snow-wreaths, the shattered stern, out of which the cargo had been evidently washed long ago, the decks crushed down with snow, the <b>bulged</b> <b>sides,</b> the bottom pierced by rocks, the bowsprit burst to shivers by the opposing cliff, the pendant and motionless cordage, even the slight ripple of the sleeping sea, which deepened rather than broke the prevailing silence, all told eloquently of death,--death, perchance to passengers and crew, at all events to sanguine hopes and prospects. Nevertheless there was much life connected with that death-like scene, as the sequel of our tale will show.|$|R

5000|$|All {{eyes were}} again turned towards the west. The sun seemed to sink with greater rapidity as it {{approached}} the sea it threw a long trail of dazzling {{light over the}} trembling {{surface of the water}} its disk soon changed from a shade of old gold, to fiery red, and, through their half-closed eyes, seemed to glitter with all the varying shades of a kaleidoscope. Faint, waving lines streaked the quivering trail of light cast {{on the surface of the}} water, like a spangled mass of glittering gems. Not the faintest sign of cloud, haze, or mist was visible along the whole of the horizon, which was as clearly defined as a black line traced on white paper. Motionless, and with intense excitement, they watched the fiery globe as it sank nearer and nearer the horizon,and, for an instant, hung suspended over the abyss. Then, through the refraction of the rays, its disk seemed to change till it looked like an Etruscan vase, with <b>bulging</b> <b>sides,</b> standing on the water.|$|R

[...] "On the western and northern side it was surrounded by an enormous sea", [...] "but in the east there was a land bridge which cut off the sea in the east forming the German Sea". [...] "There were also many small islands" [...] (the Swedish and Finnish archipelagos) [...] "where wolves could pass when the sea was frozen. In winter the country was not only cruel to people but also to wild beasts. Due to the extreme cold there were no swarms of honey-making bees." ...|$|R

40|$|Plagiocephaly has {{traditionally}} been corrected by unilateral or bilateral frontal bone advancement or rotation using bone-molding forceps and distraction devices. Complete symmetrical correction of deformed frontal bones is considered almost impossible because the curvature of each frontal bone varies. We evaluated the feasibility of measuring the optimal curvature of frontal and occipital bones using a plaster skull model and applying these measurements to “switch” them for simultaneous correction of frontal and occipital plagiocephaly. A 2 -year-old girl suffering from unifrontal flattening visited our clinic. Unilateral coronal synostosis was observed. The 3 -D rapid prototype model and skull replica method using thin paper clay were used for preplanned virtual surgery. The triangular bone was harvested from the contralateral <b>bulging</b> <b>side</b> of the occipital bone (“occipitofrontal switching”) for the best optimal curvature in the affected frontal bone. Another triangular bone was harvested from the ipsilateral flattened side of the frontal bone, and bones were switched with each other. Further bending of the frontal or occipital segment was not necessary for optimal curvature. Symmetrical correction was made by switching the triangular bone of the frontal area {{with that of the}} contralateral occipital area. Revision has not been necessary, and infection was not observed at 1 -year follow-up. Our novel technique of preplanning surgery using a 3 -D plaster model for simultaneous correction of frontal and occipital plagiocephaly is effective and time-saving...|$|R

When examined by electron microscopy, isolated particles have an appearance that is similar in size and shape to the corresponding morphological features of the 30 S subunit.
