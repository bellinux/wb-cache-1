The aim in this research is to identify the differ¬ences and similarities between accounting practiced today and double-entry bookkeeping taught at the School of Commerce in 1765. The main bibliographic base used is the manuscript dictated through the first lens (teacher) of the School, João Henrique de Souza. The historical documentary research method was applied. The main doc¬umentary source, the abovementioned manuscript, is primary. The theme is important as it addresses the begin¬nings of Portuguese-Brazilian accounting education. It should be highlighted that the <b>bookkeeping</b> <b>method</b> at that time – double-entry – contains both differences and similarities with the procedures adopted today to recognize similar operations. Analyzing the text and presenting different examples transcribed from the manuscript, the pa¬per addresses the bookkeeping of the registers used at that time (daybook, journal and ledger), the accounts used in trade and industrial activities and the method to verify the balance of the transactions that took place in that pe¬riod.

Accordingly, we introduce the cameral accounting as an alternative framework, which allows using the money (cash) accounts to report the money effects of revenues and expenditures.

In this paper, we give a simple O(mn) time algorithm for optimal buffer insertion, where m {{is the number of}} sinks and n is the number of buffer positions. This is the first linear time buffer insertion algorithm for nets with constant number of sinks. When m is small, it is a significant improvement over our recent O(n log 2 n) time algorithm, and the O(n 2) time algorithm of van Ginneken. For b buffer types, the new algorithm runs in O(b 2 n + bmn) time, an improvement of our recent O(bn 2) algorithm. The improvement is made possible by a clever <b>bookkeeping</b> <b>method</b> and an innovative linked list data structure that can perform addition of a wire, and addition of a buffer in amortized O(1) time.

40|$|Shrub fuels {{are capable}} of extreme fire {{behaviour}} under conditions that are often moderate in other fuels. There is also a narrow range of conditions that determine fire success in these fuels, below which fires may ignite but hardly spread and above which they ignite and develop into fast moving and high intensity fires. This {{is due to the}} elevated dead fine fuels that dry rapidly and carry fire. Fire danger rating systems designed for forest and grassland fuels do not predict fire potential in shrub fuels very well. Fire management requires fire danger rating systems to provide accurate and timely information on fire potential for all important fuel types. Studies of fuel moisture, ignition and fire spread were carried out in the field in gorse (Ulex europaeus L.) shrub fuels to predict the moisture content of the elevated dead fuels and to define the conditions that govern fire development. The accuracy of the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System to predict moisture content of this layer was assessed. A <b>bookkeeping</b> <b>method</b> to predict moisture content was developed based on semi-physical models of equilibrium moisture content, fuel response time and the FFMC. The FFMC predicted moisture content poorly, because the FWI System is based on the litter layer of a mature conifer forest. The gorse elevated dead fuel layer is more aerated and dries faster than this conifer forest litter layer. The <b>bookkeeping</b> <b>method</b> was reliable and allowed adjustment of fuel response time based on weather conditions. Difficulties in modelling meteorological conditions under the gorse canopy limited its accuracy. Separate thresholds determined ignition and fire spread success, with both based on the elevated dead fuel moisture content. Options to improve the shrub fire danger rating system were presented based on these findings. The results are significant because they are based on data collected in the field under real conditions. Validation of these results and extension to other shrub fuels is required before the findings are used to change current models. However, the study has significantly advanced the knowledge of fire behaviour in shrub fuels and will contribute to safe and effective fire management in these fuels...|$|R

We critically investigate the use of octree grids in Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer, with two different octree construction algorithms (regular and barycentric subdivision) and three different octree traversal algorithms (top-down, neighbour list, and the <b>bookkeeping</b> <b>method).</b> In general, regular octree grids need higher levels of subdivision compared to the barycentric grids for a fixed maximum cell mass threshold criterion. The total number of grid cells, however, depends on the geometry of the model. Surprisingly, regular octree grid simulations turn out to be 10 to 20 % more efficient in run time than the barycentric grid simulations, even for those cases where the latter contain fewer grid cells than the former. Furthermore, we find that storing neighbour lists for each cell in an octree, ordered according to decreasing overlap area, is worth the additional memory and implementation overhead: using neighbour lists can cut down the grid traversal by 20 % compared to the traditional top-down method. In conclusion, the combination of a regular node subdivision and the neighbour list method results in the most efficient octree structure for Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{inclusive}} fitness {{plays a key}} role in much of sociobiology. Yet most theoretical studies concerning the evolution of social behavior circumvent inclusive fitness by mobilizing the concept of frequency dependent individual fitness. Given certain assumptions, it is shown that models based on these two different concepts are dynamically equivalent. The models do differ, however, in <b>bookkeeping</b> <b>methods</b> which are advantageous under different circumstances. A knowledge of these circumstances should prove of value to students of social behavior. It is then shown that evolution acts according to an adaptive landscape based on Hamilton's inclusive fitness in the absence of strong selection and inbreeding. This yields an inclusive fitness analogue to much of traditional population genetics. For example, heterozygote superiority in inclusive fitness yields stable polymorphisms, while intermediate dominance results in fixation of one of the alleles. When individuals do not affect one another's fitnesses, the inclusive fitness topography collapses to one based on individual fitness. A general rule for the evolution of social behavior under intermediate dominance is shown to yield Hamilton's Rule as a special case. Next, a general model for examining the evolution of social behavior is developed which, unlike inclusive fitness models, does not require that benefits received be linear functions of the number of social donors encountered. The subsocial route for the evolution of eusociality in haplodiploid organisms is then examined within the context of this model. Nonlinearities render conditions for frequency independent fixation or loss of sister-helping alleles more stringent than expected from models based on the assumption of linear benefits. In particular, both stable polymorphisms and frequency dependent selective thresholds for sister-helping behavior may commonly obtain...|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} of the engine with the airframe is investigated in the German-Dutch Wind tunnels (DNW) using special scale engines called Turbofan Powered Simulators (TPS). The bookkeeping of thrust and drag must be clear. The TPS thrust is determined under static conditions in a calibration facility, and then subtracted in the wind tunnel test from the balance force of the aircraft model (airframe + TPS) to obtain the airframe drag including jet interference drag. A critical assumption valid for traditional turbofan engines is that the external flow {{does not affect the}} statically calibrated thrust. However, with the rise of more efficient engines with higher bypass ratio {{this may not be the}} case due to the close coupling between the engine flow and the wing. The objective of this Thesis is to identify the current limitations of the testing procedure as well as to produce scientific basis to deal with these limitations. This is achieved by means of a consistent thrust/drag <b>bookkeeping</b> combining numerical <b>methods</b> and a modified experimental setup. External flow effects are identified by means of the analysis of theoretical models, the comparison with testing procedures undertaken in similar facilities, the review of standard bookkeeping techniques of full-scale turbofan engines and the analysis of previous test data. The change in thrust is quantified using a mathematical model integrated in an error propagation study by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The influence of the external flow and wing pressure field is further studied through a numerical analysis in RANS-SST for a very high bypass ratio TPS unit, and a Through-Flow Nacelle respectively. The latter configuration is also tested in the Low Speed Tunnel in DNW to investigate which instrumentation can be used to detect external flow effects in the future. In this case the velocity in the fan exhaust plane is measured with a hot wire and static pressure sensors are placed in the intake, exhaust and boattail. The theoretical, numerical and experimental approach show that the external flow and wing pressure field change the conditions in the TPS exhaust with respect to static calibration. In the wind tunnel, the nozzle exhaust shear layer decreases in size as the difference in velocities between plume and free air is decreased, reducing the flow spreading rate and increasing the local pressure at the nozzle exit plane. The local Nozzle Pressure Ratio is reduced. This leads to flow suppression, the reduction of the fan mass flow and exhaust velocity. In addition, the scrubbing and boattail drag, currently bookkept as loss of thrust in the modified standard net thrust, are changed from static to wind tunnel conditions. These effects change the TPS thrust leading towards an improperly bookkeeping of the aircraft installation drag. The bias error produced by external flow effects is one order of magnitude higher than the random instrumentation error and should be corrected for, especially at low power settings. Differences decrease proportionally to the Fan Nozzle Pressure Ratio until chocked conditions are reached, where the freestream velocity has no influence in the TPS performance. A possible solution lies in the advanced derivation of thrust and drag. The current approach neglects the thrust contribution from the nozzle exhaust to infinite downstream. According to the definition of the Jones thrust, a better solution lies in the assumption that the flow is expanded from the exhaust to infinity downstream without any transfer of energy of momentum. The decrease in mass flow and velocity can be effectively captured by pressure taps located at the intake or fan plane. A linear correlation exists between both stations, that can be used for the bookkeeping of the TPS thrust in the wind tunnel according to additional calibration in the wind tunnel. The new <b>bookkeeping</b> <b>method</b> can also be used to correct for the decrease in local jet exhaust Mach number from design conditions, the parameter of interest in engine/airframe integration tests. The research presents and solves the limitations of the new generation of turbofan engines by accounting for the local conditions at the TPS exhaust due to external flow effects. The new thrust/drag <b>bookkeeping</b> <b>method</b> leads to optimized configurations by improving the accuracy of engine/airframe integration tests...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of {{the total}} mission life of a {{spacecraft}} {{is an important issue}} for the communication satellite industries. For accurate determination of the remaining mission life of the satellite it is essential to estimate the amount of propellant present in the propellant tank of the spacecraft at various stages of its mission life. Because the annual revenue incurred from a typical communication satellite operating at its full capacity is on the order of millions of dollars, premature removal of spacecraft from their orbits results in heavy losses. Various techniques such as the bo okkeeping method, the gas law method, numerical modeling techniques, and use of capacitive sensors have been employed in the past for accurate determination of the amount of propellant present in a spacecraft. First half of the thesis is concerned with sensitivity analysis of the various propellant gauging techniques, that is, estimating the e ects of the uncertainty in the instruments employed in the propellant gauging system on the onboard propellant estimation. This sensitivity analysis is done for three existing propellant gauging techniques – gas injection method, book-keeping method and the propellant tank heating method. A comparative study of the precision with which the onboard propellant is estimated by the three techniques is done and the primary source of uncertainty for all the three techniques is identified. It is illustrated that all the three methods — the gas injection method, the book-keeping method and the propellant tank heating method — are inherently indirect methods of propellant gauging, as a consequence of which, the precision with which the three techniques estimate the residual propellant decreases towards the end of mission life of the spacecraft. The second half of the thesis explores the possibility of using a new propellant tank configuration, consisting of a truncated cone centrally mounted within a spherical propellant tank, to measure the amount of liquid propellant present within the tank. The liquid propellant present within the propellant tank orients itself in a geometry, by virtue of its dominant surface tension force in zero-g condition, which minimizes its total surface energy. Study reveals that the amount of liquid propellant present in the tank can thus be estimated by measuring the height of the propellant meniscus within the central cone. It is also observed that, unlike gas law metho d, <b>bookkeeping</b> <b>method</b> or the propellant tank heating metho d, where the precision of the estimated propellant fill-fraction decreases towards the end-of-life of the spacecraft, for the proposed new configuration the precision increases...|$|R
