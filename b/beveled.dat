5|$|Escher {{learned his}} wood {{engraving}} technique from Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita. He illustrated the octahedral compound of Stars in the <b>beveled</b> wire-frame style {{that had been}} used by Leonardo da Vinci in his illustrations for Luca Pacioli's 1509 book, De divina proportione.|$|E
5|$|The type-B plug has a near square {{cross-section}} {{with the}} top exterior corners <b>beveled.</b> As part of a removable cable, it inserts into an upstream port on a device, such as a printer. On some devices, the type-B receptacle has no data connections, being used solely for accepting power from the upstream device. This two-connector-type scheme (A/B) prevents a user from accidentally creating a loop.|$|E
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} returned briefly, {{creating the}} White Throne member, but encroaching seas again <b>beveled</b> the coastline, forming a regional unconformity. Thin beds of clay and silt {{mark the end}} of this formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation make up the capstone of West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example). Temple Cap iron oxide is also the source of the red-orange color of much {{the lower half of the}} Navajo Formation.|$|E
5|$|Early Philippine {{sculpture}} {{is characterized}} by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures {{are related to the}} ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought <b>beveled</b> type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu. The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches. Filipinos' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery.|$|E
5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 the DeKalb County Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for DeKalb County. The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front doors to the courthouse hide the original, <b>beveled</b> glass front doors from view. Once inside the modern doors, the nonfunctional original doors can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the doors, in the building's main lobby, is the large, marble staircase to the second floor. The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the first floor is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, first floor courtrooms. The plasterwork along the walls and ceilings of the lobby is ornately decorated.|$|E
5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly <b>beveled</b> (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly <b>beveled.</b> In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Charvet {{launched}} a toilet water, in a rectangular <b>beveled</b> bottle. One {{of the customers}} for this perfume was Boy Capel, Coco Chanel's lover. In 1921, two years after his accidental death, the flacon of Chanel's famous Nº5 perfume was produced {{in the image of}} the Charvet bottle.|$|E
25|$|The Llama M-87 was {{introduced}} in 1986. This was a high-grade competition pistol based on M-82 with extended barrel, compensator, muzzle weight, target sights, target trigger, additional manual safety, extended magazine release, extended safety levers, <b>beveled</b> magazine well, and two-tone finish (chrome with blued slide). Despite the high price, (Retail $US1,450) the M-87 was greeted with excellent reviews on release. However the glowing reviews were unable to overcome distrust of so many innovations on such an expensive gun.|$|E
25|$|The M9A3 (the M9A2 concept {{never went}} into production) was {{released}} in 2015 {{as part of the}} Modular Handgun System trials. The main updates to the M9A3 were a 3-slot Picatinny rail, thinner vertical grip, removable wrap-around grips that can be swapped between Vertec-style and 'old' M9 style, fully removable sights and a universal slide, which makes the gun convertible from decocker-safety to decocker-only mode. Additionally, the M9A3 comes with 17-round sand-resistant magazines in a <b>beveled</b> shape for easier reloading.|$|E
25|$|On {{the north}} (front) facade, the {{original}} church has corner buttresses. The entrances are heavy wooden lancet arched doors with <b>beveled</b> leaded glass panels set in angled reveals. Colonettes at {{the outer edge}} gradually become convex moldings at the doors' edge. Above the main entrance is a tripartite lancet-arch Gothic window topped by a blind quatrefoil in the gable field. The side entrance is separated by a buttress, topped with a small square pinnacle above the roofline and complemented by a larger conical pinnacle rising from the corner buttress.|$|E
25|$|The base of skull {{was found}} intact. The {{back of the}} skull cavity {{contains}} the shrunken and desiccated brain and dura mater of the Lady. There {{is no evidence of}} embalming material within the cranial cavity. Researchers located an oval defect in the skull. It is located in {{the central part of the}} frontal bone, in front of the coronal suture. The defect has sharp, <b>beveled,</b> and festooned edges. The lack of evidence for attempted healing or sclerosis indicate that the defect was caused by a postmortem alteration of the body, probably during the embalming process. The embalmers likely used a sharp instrument on the skull.|$|E
25|$|The {{doors of}} the mosques in Cairo were of two kinds; those which, externally, were cased with sheets of bronze or iron, cut out in {{decorative}} patterns, and incised or inlaid, with bosses in relief; and those in wood, which were framed with interlaced designs of the square and diamond, this latter description of work being Coptic in its origin. The {{doors of the}} palace at Palermo, which were made by Saracenic workmen for the Normans, are fine examples and in good preservation. A somewhat similar decorative class of door to these latter is found in Verona, where {{the edges of the}} stiles and rails are <b>beveled</b> and notched.|$|E
25|$|The Old Courthouse {{interior}} {{is composed of}} quadrants which are set apart by broad hallways which meet at the building's center. There they form a large, open three story rotunda. The rotunda is the dominating feature of the interior. It rises over 100 {{feet into the air}} and at the top features an allegorical painting representing peace and prosperity. The halls have mosaic floors and wall treatment composed of white marble dado which is capped with antique verde serpentine stone. Marbleized plaster, scagliola, panels complete the walls. The building's ceilings are decorated with plaster cornices and molded leaf and rosette compliments. The Honduras mahogany doors have a rail and panel design and <b>beveled</b> glass is used for decorative side lights and panels.|$|E
25|$|All titanosaurs {{had what}} is called wide-gauge posture, a {{relative}} term to describe a stance in which the feet fell apart from the body midline. More derived titanosaurs had {{a greater degree of}} wide-gauge posture, with their limbs held more widely than their ancestors and contemporaneous counterparts. The stance of Dreadnoughtus schrani was clearly wide-gauge, but not to the degree of saltasaurids because the femoral condyles are perpendicular to its shaft rather than <b>beveled.</b> This {{and the fact that the}} head of the femur was not turned in towards the body as in saltasaurids support the phylogenetic conclusion that Dreadnoughtus was not a saltasaurid. The animal’s broad sternal bones also demonstrate a wide pectoral girdle, giving it a broad-shouldered, broad-chested appearance. Paleontologist Kenneth Lacovara compared the animal's gait to an Imperial Walker.|$|E
25|$|Modern marching {{bands and}} drum corps use multi-tenors, which consist of several {{single-headed}} tom-toms {{played by a}} single drummer. The bottoms of the shells are open and <b>beveled</b> to project {{the sound of the}} drum forward. Double-ply PET film heads are typically used for increased sound projection and durability. They are typically played with wooden- or aluminum-shafted mallets that have disc-shaped heads made of nylon. Mallets with felt or fleece heads, drum sticks, drum brushes, and other implements are occasionally used to achieve different timbres. The playing technique used for multi-tenors is somewhat different from that of a snare drum, and more like that of a timpani because the drumhead is struck closer to the edge instead of in the center. This creates a sound with more overtone, as opposed to striking the drumhead in the center, which produces a very short, dull sound with few overtones that is considered undesirable for multi-tenors.|$|E
25|$|Flat, circular, and unusually shaped walls can {{be covered}} with copper cladding. Most are field-formed from sheet material. They can also be pre-manufactured. In addition, {{engineered}} systems such as insulated panels, non-insulated honeycomb panels, copper screen panels, and structural wall claddings are available. Horizontal copper siding provides a relatively flat appearance with fine horizontal lines. <b>Beveled</b> copper panels have depth for heavy-shadowed effects. Flat siding has minimal shadows. Structural panels {{are designed to be}} attached directly to a wall structure without the use of a continuous substrate. Diagonal flat lock panels are used on curved surfaces, such as domes, spires and vaults. Horizontal flat lock panels are basically identical to flat seam roofing applied on a vertical surface. Copper screen panels are a lightweight finish screen that can be perforated or have shaped openings to function as sun or decorative screens. A copper alloy curtain wall is a non-structural outer building covering that keeps out weather. Composite copper cladding is made by attaching copper sheeting to both sides of rigid thermoplastic sheet.|$|E
25|$|The bird is shiny blue-black {{with white}} {{markings}} on its neck {{and back and}} extensive white on {{the trailing edge of}} both the upper- and underwing. The underwing is also white along its forward edge, resulting in a black line running along the middle of the underwing, expanding to more extensive black at the wingtip. In adults, the bill is ivory in color, and chalky white in juveniles. Ivory-bills have a prominent crest, although in juveniles it is ragged. The crest is black in juveniles and females. In males, the crest is black along its forward edge, changing abruptly to red on the side and rear. The chin of an ivory-billed woodpecker is black. When perched with the wings folded, birds of both sexes present a large patch of white on the lower back, roughly triangular in shape. These characteristics distinguish them from the smaller and darker-billed pileated woodpecker. The pileated woodpecker normally is brownish-black, smoky, or slaty black in color. It also has a white neck stripe, but the back is normally black. Pileated woodpecker juveniles and adults have a red crest and a white chin. Pileated woodpeckers normally have no white on the trailing edges of their wings and when perched, normally show only a small patch of white {{on each side of the}} body near the edge of the wing. However, pileated woodpeckers, apparently aberrant individuals, have been reported with white trailing edges on the wings, forming a white triangular patch on the lower back when perched. Like all woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker has a strong and straight bill and a long, mobile, hard-tipped, barbed tongue. Among North American woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker is unique in having a bill whose tip is quite flattened laterally, shaped much like a <b>beveled</b> wood chisel.|$|E
500|$|Volcanoes {{continued}} to erupt through the Early Triassic on the north–south trending island arc to the west, which was located along {{what is now}} the border between California and Nevada. Shallow, marine water stretched from eastern Utah to eastern Nevada over a <b>beveled</b> continental shelf. As the sea withdrew around 230million years ago, fluvial, mudflat, sabkha, and shallow marine environments developed, depositing [...] gypsum (from lagoon evaporites), mudstones, [...] limestones, sandstones, shales, and siltstones.|$|E

500|$|The gun turrets, {{designed}} by Captain Coles of the Royal Navy, sat on circular turntables that were built on an iron radial platform with arms that rested on <b>beveled</b> wheels [...] in diameter. Each turret required {{a crew of}} 18 men to rotate them via a system of rack and pinion gears; one minute was required for a full 360° rotation. They could be rotated from inside the turret as well from outside. In emergencies the turret could be turned by a block and tackle as well as use of handspikes. A leather flap extended around {{the bottom of the}} turret and over the gap between the turret and the deck to reduce any water leakage through the gap. Like most contemporary ironclads they were fitted with a forged iron ram.|$|E

500|$|The product {{improvement}} program kit replaced the original steel tubular stock {{with a plastic}} stock based upon {{the shape of the}} heavier M240 machine gun. The change in stocks allowed for the addition of a hydraulic buffer system to reduce recoil. In addition, the dual gas port settings were reduced to only one; variants with the {{product improvement}} kit can no longer fire at a higher cyclic speed. A handguard was added above the barrel to prevent burns, and the formerly fixed barrel changing handle was swapped for a folding unit. Certain parts were <b>beveled</b> or chamfered to prevent cutting soldiers' hands and arms. Other changes involved the bipod, pistol grip, flash suppressor, and sights. Over the years, additional modifications have been introduced as part of the Soldier Enhancement Program and Rapid Fielding Initiative. These include an improved bipod, 100– and 200–round fabric [...] "soft pack" [...] magazines (to replace the original plastic ammunition boxes), and Picatinny rails for the feed tray cover and forearm so that optics and other accessories may be added.|$|E
500|$|The World Trade Center towers {{included}} many structural engineering innovations in skyscraper design and construction, which allowed the buildings to reach new heights {{and become the}} tallest in the world. Traditionally, skyscrapers used a skeleton of columns distributed throughout the interior to support building loads, with interior columns disrupting the floor space. The tube-frame concept, earlier introduced by Fazlur Khan, was a major innovation, allowing open floor plans and more space to rent. The buildings used high-strength, load-bearing perimeter steel columns called Vierendeel trusses that were spaced closely {{together to form a}} strong, rigid wall structure. There were 60 perimeter columns, narrowly spaced, {{on each side of the}} buildings. In all, the perimeter walls of the towers were [...] on each side, and the corners were <b>beveled.</b> [...] The perimeter columns were designed to provide support for virtually all lateral loads (such as wind loads) and to share the gravity loads with the core columns. Structural analysis of major portions of the World Trade Center were computed on an IBM 1620.|$|E
500|$|Development of the second-generation LS 400 {{began after}} {{worldwide}} {{launch of the}} first generation under program code 250T. Given the first-generation model's successful reception and high level of customer satisfaction with its design, replicating the original LS 400's attributes with its successor was one of chief engineer Kazuo Okamoto's primary goals (he stated that [...] "a tradition cannot be founded if you reject the first generation"). Externally, the most significant change was an increase in wheelbase length of , resulting in more interior space and an additional [...] of rear-seat legroom. However, as the overall length remained the same, trunk capacity was slightly reduced. The more aerodynamic body (C'd 0.28) retained the general profile and contours of the original LS 400 and was the work of the Calty Design Research center in the U.S. Designers had evaluated 20 competing concepts, including several with a radically changed body, before selecting a winning entry in 1991 that included forms and contours similar to the original LS 400. Upon final approval in 1992, an evolutionary redesign was the ultimate result, with new design features consisting of sharper angles, curved body lines, and a <b>beveled</b> grille. More prominent side lines provided a reference point for parking maneuvers, and forward visibility was improved. Production development lasted from 1991 until conclusion {{in the second quarter of}} 1994.|$|E
500|$|Shoin-zukuri, a new {{architectural}} style influenced by zen Buddhism, developed {{during that time}} from the shinden-zukuri of earlier Heian period palaces and the subsequent residential style favored by the warrior class during the Kamakura period. The term , meaning study or drawing room, {{has been used to}} denote reception rooms in residences of the military elite as well as study rooms at monasteries. A shoin has a core area surrounded by aisles, with smaller areas separated by fusuma sliding doors, or shōji partitions constructed of paper on a wooden frame or wooden equivalents, [...] and [...] A main reception room is characterized by specific features: a recessed alcove (tokonoma); staggered shelves; built-in desks; and ornate sliding doors. Generally the reception room is covered with wall-to-wall tatami, has square <b>beveled</b> pillars, a coved and/or coffered ceiling, and [...] The entrance hall (genkan) emerged as an element of residential architecture during the Momoyama period. The oldest extant shoin style building is the Tōgu-dō at Ginkaku-ji from 1485. Other representative examples of early shoin style, also called shuden, include two guest halls at Mii-dera. In the early Edo period, shoin-zukuri reached its peak and spread beyond the residences of the military elite. The more formal shoin-style of this period is apparent in the characteristics of Ninomaru Palace at Nijō Castle as well as the shoin at Nishi Hongan-ji.|$|E
