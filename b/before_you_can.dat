25|$|Pieces {{that can}} slide forward promote far {{more easily than}} steppers or jumpers. As the board thins out their {{promotion}} becomes unavoidable, while steppers can almost always be met by an opponent stepper to neutralize it {{by the time it}} arrives at the promotion zone. The potential promotion gain of the sliders is thus always {{an important part of the}} material balance, but if it makes up too large a part of your total strength, you might be overwhelmed <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> develop this potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{left and}} right board edge are {{controlled}} by the battery formed by Lance and Chariot. Usually little can be achieved here before you somehow acquire a majority by taking {{out some of the}} opponent's pieces there from the side. But even if the opponent's edge would be completely annihilated, it will take an impractically long time <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> cash in on that, and promote Lance and Chariot so they can get involved on the real battle, as you would first have to get your Pawn out of the way by walking it to promotion. So a majority here is more a tie breaker in case the main battle ends undecided than an immediate advantage.|$|E

25|$|The {{valuable}} long-range sliders {{have to be}} {{shielded from}} attack by the enemy's much less-valuable steppers by operating from behind your own steppers, or they would get quickly lost through fork attacks. As the steppers start on the back rank, {{they need to be}} developed <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> engage the opponent. This is usually done by pushing the Pawns one rank forward, creating a passage through the 3rd rank by moving up some of the sliders there, and walk Copper, Silver and Leopard to the 4th rank and beyond through the resulting corridor. One of the Side Movers is usually moved up to 4th rank, so that when your own camp empties as a result of launching your attack, the Side Movers prevent entry of the enemy Lion by controlling 3rd and 4th rank.|$|E
25|$|For an {{organization}} {{to be focused}} on a democratic leadership style, traits, functions and relationships have to be obtained. <b>Before</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> classify someone to leadership position, certain qualities have to follow. The common assumptions of leaders are: leaders are born; however, this is not the case. Leaders are developed through different types of training and experience. Through the training and experience, the leader gains different traits to help make the organization functional. Leaders need to be interpersonal, cognitive, and motivational. An interpersonal leader allows for relationships to be built and to communicate messages to their followers. Cognitive leaders are able to problem solve more effective because of their intellectual ability to process information and come up with creative ideas to help eliminate the problem in the organization. Finally, having motivational leaders gets the organization excited about new tasks and this allows for positive productions to occur. Motivation has been associated with ratings of leadership potential, career achievement, and promotion. The three traits will help a leader become successful because others will look up to them, and create a positive organization to work in.|$|E
500|$|Todd {{found the}} pack's {{difficulty}} to be [...] "wildly careening" [...] and stated, [...] "Some battles are amazingly easy. You can soar through many scraps in moments, with your party carving up the opposition <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tell if you're fighting a mummy or a zombie. However, others are absolutely brutal ... There {{are more than}} a couple of moments in the game in which your party is ambushed by enemy spellcasters that rip you to pieces <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> even think about a proper response." [...] He praised the game's music as blending in seamlessly with that of the original game, but criticized it for having a minimal amount of voice acting, with sequences of dialogue that begin with audio and transition into text. Steve Butts commented on this, saying, [...] "the dialogue here really needs some work ... you'll even be treated to some truly tortured sentences. 'Wait till you see how deep into the backside of evil I insert my boot in the name of justice!' is probably my favorite. It's too bad there's not more voice acting in the game, because hearing someone speak lines like that out loud may have given the developers an opportunity to edit some of the worst offenders." ...|$|E

Davide Ambrosiani (IGN) said Fallout 4s last expansion pack added some interesting mechanics and expands the world further. Juan Garcia (IGN) wrote about how he believed the expansion added a [...] "great new location" [...] which added a few more hours of gameplay, although it was more limited and repetitive than he wanted. Andrew Webster (The Verge) enjoyed exploring the map and discovering every detail of Fallouts world. He regarded it as a [...] "superb piece of worldbuilding." ...|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} filming, {{in early}} February 1964, Sellers met Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi. On 19 February 1964, just ten days after their first meeting, the couple married. Sellers soon showed signs of {{insecurity}} and paranoia; he would become highly anxious and jealous, for example, when Ekland starred opposite attractive men. Shortly after the wedding, Sellers started filming on location in Twentynine Palms, California for Billy Wilder's Kiss Me, Stupid, opposite Dean Martin and Kim Novak. The relationship between Wilder and Sellers became strained; both had different approaches to work and often clashed as a result. On the night of 5 April 1964, prior to having sex with Ekland, Sellers inhaled amyl nitrites (poppers) as a sexual stimulant in his search for [...] "the ultimate orgasm", and suffered a series of eight heart attacks {{over the course of}} three hours as a result. His illness forced him to withdraw from the filming of Kiss Me, Stupid and he was replaced by Ray Walston. Wilder was unsympathetic about the heart attacks, saying that [...] "you have to have a heart <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have an attack".|$|E

500|$|Despite being {{a member}} of Slipknot since 1999, it was the first album where guitarist Jim Root had been {{significantly}} involved. He had joined them during the later recording stages of Slipknot and subsequently became more involved with this album. During an interview with Guitar magazine in November 2001 he explained, [...] "it was so exciting as well as scary {{to be part of this}} whole huge process", adding that there was a lot of pressure from fellow guitarist Mick Thomson to perform well on the record. In an interview with FHM in December 2001, vocalist Corey Taylor revealed that he put himself in specific situations to achieve his performance on the album. While recording vocals for the final song [...] "Iowa" [...] he was completely naked, vomiting all over himself and cutting himself with broken glass. Explaining this, he said, [...] "that's where the best stuff comes from. You've got to break yourself down <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> build something great." [...] While producing the album, Ross Robinson was injured from a dirt bike accident, fracturing his back. He returned to the studio after a day of hospital treatment, reportedly [...] "putting all of his pain into the album", much to the admiration of the band.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene of}} Sniper Wolf {{wounding}} Meryl {{to set a}} trap for Snake was included among the top ten cutscenes in the Metal Gear series by Jeremy M. Loss of Joystick Division in 2010 and ranked as the seventh most shocking surprise in video games ("subverting the power fantasy") by George Reith of GamingBolt in 2012. In Trigger Happy, Steven Poole noted how the [...] "brillantly manipulative" [...] Metal Gear Solid can make the player feel guilty, even as [...] "it {{makes no sense to}} wish that you hadn't killed Sniper Wolf — that is, [...] properly to regret your actions — because it is a task that the game demands be fulfilled <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> progress." [...] In 2012, Ryan King of PLAY included the character of Sniper Wolf among the six [...] "things you didn’t want to kill (but you did anyway)" [...] and Ian Dransfield from the same magazine included her among the top [...] "bad guys you wanted to win". In 2015, Aleksander Gilyadov from VentureBeat included Sniper Wolf's death among six most memorable Metal Gear moments opining it [...] "still remains {{as one of the most}} poignant and beautiful scenes in the entire series. It also displays just how multilayered, benign, and well-written Kojima’s characters (both heroes and villains) really are." [...] That same year, Javy Gwaltney from Paste had this scene top his list of the saddest moments in Metal Gear.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{began writing}} the series very early on, hoping to avoid {{publication}} delays {{such as those}} faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000. When writing the script for the first issue, Moore said he realized, [...] "I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!" [...] His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that [...] "he script for {{the first issue of}} Watchmen was, I think, 101 pages of typescript—single-spaced—with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages." [...] Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page [...] "in case I drop them on the floor, because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order", and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, [...] "It takes quite a bit of organizing <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> actually put pen to paper." [...] Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note [...] "If that doesn't work for you, do what works best"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script: a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach, as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons {{had a great deal of}} autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen, and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.|$|E

2500|$|Lerner {{points out}} that grey and black {{operations}} ultimately have a heavy cost, in that the target population sooner or later recognizes them as propaganda and discredits the source.

People and situations change and come back again, and your experiences in the past give you foresight into the future <b>before</b> <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> choose to change or break the cycle, or choose to let it happen again.
