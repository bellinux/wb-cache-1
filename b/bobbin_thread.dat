The <b>bobbin</b> <b>threads</b> are carried on brass bobbins that are held in {{carriages}} that are swung back and forth on combs in a pushing and catching routine. Pillaring is controlled by the pillaring cam; in net formation the pillars must be connected and this can be done by the spool threads (top or bottom board). These are secured each time by the <b>bobbin</b> <b>threads.</b> Patterning or gimping is created by using longer shogs on the spool threads.|$|R
50|$|It has two warp beams, {{though it}} can be run using just one or none. An S-twist thread is out on the front warp (right warp) and a Z- twist on the back warp (left warp, reverse warp). All the warp ends pass through a sley with {{individual}} perforations- to keep the threads from tangling.On a machine with 3000 front warp ends, that will mean 6000 perforations, all front warp ends will be of the same count, and all back warp ends will be of the same count, though the two warps can carry different counts. The warp threads interact with the brass <b>bobbin</b> <b>threads</b> to form the net or openwork ground. The reverse warp threads (introduced in 1830) lock the front warp <b>threads</b> against the <b>bobbin</b> <b>threads.</b> The warp threads are tensioned by a spring.|$|R

These software packages are capable on calculating thread consumption for varying parameters such as stitch lengths, stitch densities, fabric thickness etc. Majority of stitch-classes used in the apparel sector have been defined in these systems. Parameters such as seam widths are also included with the appropriate stitch type. Unlike previous techniques, thread consumptions are calculated separately for needle <b>threads,</b> <b>bobbin</b> <b>threads</b> and looper threads. Though certain software solutions address thread properties such as ticket number for thread consumption calculations, majority of solutions have not addressed some critical physical properties which associates stitch formation.|$|R

50|$|To {{make one}} stitch, the machine lowers the {{threaded}} needle through the cloth into the bobbin area, where a rotating hook (or other hooking mechanism) catches the upper thread {{at the point}} just after it goes through the needle. The hook mechanism carries the upper thread entirely around the bobbin case, so that it has made one wrap of the <b>bobbin</b> <b>thread.</b> Then the take-up arm pulls the excess upper thread (from the bobbin area) back to the top, forming the lockstitch. Then the feed dogs pull the material along one stitch length, and the cycle repeats.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, two {{approaches}} in fabricating textile antennas with double-layer embroidery technique, {{as one of}} the way to increase the textile antennas' efficiency, are discussed and compared. In the first approach, a conductive thread is used for both the upper and lower (<b>bobbin)</b> <b>threads,</b> while in the second, the conductive thread is used only for the lower thread but the embroidery process is done twice. To study the effect of each approach, two embroidered rectangular patch antennas operating at 2. 45 GHz ISM band were fabricated and measured. The embroidered layers were then placed on top of a 3. 175 mm thick Rogers TMM 3 substrate, tested, and compared with an etched copper version of the patch antenna. The results show that both approaches give a comparable radiation performance to the etched copper version with a slightly higher efficiency in the first one. However, the second approach allows faster and cost efficient fabrication. 2 page(s...|$|R

This paper {{presents}} some {{development work}} {{following up on}} previous research on monitoring and control techniques for high-speed industrial sewing machines. The main objective of the studies is to develop techniques and devices to allow a faster set-up, greater flexibility and higher product quality in industrial sewing operations. One of the main aspects of the sewing process is the interlacing of threads – stitch formation. It {{has been found that}} the on-line measurement of thread consumption can provide information about stitch adjustment and serve as a feedback variable for thread tension control. In this paper, an overview of this technique will be given, with particular focus on the quantification of <b>bobbin</b> <b>thread</b> consumption in lockstitch machines, {{one of the most widely}} used type of machine. In this specific case, measurement is difficult due to lack of physical space for the sensors. Fundação para a Ci~Encia e Tecnologia - Fundação para a Ciência - POSI/SRI/ 38944 / 2001...|$|E

The <b>thread</b> <b>bobbin</b> technique has proven successful for gathering ecological information in a range of habitats, but has not yet been used in tropical rainforests. Here we test the method {{for the first time in}} a humid tropical forest habitat on 14 herpetofaunal species. We found <b>thread</b> <b>bobbins</b> to be effective for large anurans (one leptodactylid and one bufonid), medium-large terrestrial snakes (one boid, three colubrids and one viperid), and testudines (one chelid), but largely unsuccessful for arboreal snakes (one boid and one colubrid), small and slender snakes (two colubrids), and small anurans (one strabomantid). We tracked 18 individuals for 1. 2 – 15 d (mean 4. 6 d) for distances of 5. 5 – 469. 3 m (mean 159. 2 m). The thread trail revealed the exact movements of the tracked animal, providing detailed information on activity and microhabitat use that many alternative tracking methods cannot provide. Conservation projects rely heavily upon understanding the life history of species and without this prior knowledge, conservation efforts can fail, wasting funds and resources. We show that the <b>thread</b> <b>bobbin</b> method is a cost-effective technique that can be used to rapidly gather detailed ecological information on the life history of relatively unknown rainforest reptiles and amphibians...|$|R
5000|$|Some modern weavers thread each card individually, {{but this}} is time consuming. The {{traditional}} threading method is to put all the threads through the holes of an entire deck.

5000|$|Machinery {{created during}} the 18th- and 19th-century Industrial Revolution changed garment {{production}} with technology such as power looms and sewing machines, making fabrics of more uniform quality and greatly increased production efficiency. Embroidery—once a time-consuming hand-made stitch-by-stitch process—was revolutionized by {{the introduction of}} the Schiffli embroidery machine, invented by Isaak Groebli of Switzerland in 1863. Like the game-changing sewing machine, it operated with a two-thread system. Early production from the multi-needle machine, powered by a hand-turned crank, wasn’t much quicker than handwork, but significantly, multiple copies of identical designs could be created. Groebli's machine utilized the combination of a continuously threaded needle and shuttle containing a <b>bobbin</b> of <b>thread.</b> The shuttle itself looked similar to the hull of a sailboat. [...] "Schiffli" [...] means [...] "little boat" [...] in the Swiss dialect of the German language, so his machine {{came to be known as}} a schiffli machine. [...] An automatic machine, refined by Isaak’s eldest son in 1898, simplified the mechanical system so it could be run by a single operator.|$|R

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the cap frame ca.1828 was a step forward in attaining higher production and finer yarn spinning. It is suitable for producing yarns made from botany and fine crossbred quality wools. Unlike the flyer frame where the spindle and flyer rotate, on the cap frame the spindle is stationary and carries a steel cap. Moving {{up and down the}} spindle is a lifter plate which carries the spinning tube on which the bobbin fits. The revolving tube and bobbin impart twist to the yarn until it becomes strong enough to wind onto the bobbin. The speed of the <b>bobbin</b> causes the <b>thread</b> to balloon, and the air resistance to this balloon, combined with friction on the cap edge, is sufficient to give enough tension for winding on at the line of the cap edge as the bobbin moves up and down inside the cap. This machine is hand doffed.|$|R

Many of the children worked barefoot, which made it easier to climb the machinery to reach <b>bobbins</b> or broken <b>threads.</b> Children met with accidents more often than adults.Hines was told by the overseer of one mill [...] "We don't have any accidents in this mill .... Once in a while a finger is mashed, or a foot, but it don't amount to anything." [...] Conditions were demanding. There was a constant racket of machinery. The mill windows were kept closed, creating a hot and humid atmosphere in which cotton threads were less likely to break. The air was filled with lint and dust, making breathing difficult, and often leading to diseases such as tuberculosis and chronic bronchitis. Some workers suffered from Byssinosis, or brown lung, caused by prolonged exposure to cotton dust.|$|R
5000|$|Operation of weaving in {{a textile}} mill is {{undertaken}} by a specially trained operator {{known as a}} weaver. Weavers are expected to uphold high industry standards, and are tasked with monitoring anywhere from ten, {{to as many as}} thirty separate looms at any one time. During their operating shift, weavers will first utilize a wax pencil or crayon to sign their initials onto the cloth to mark a shift change, and then walk along the cloth side (front) of the looms they tend, gently touching the fabric as it comes from the reed. This is done to feel for any broken [...] "picks" [...] or filler thread. Should broken picks be detected, the weaver will disable the machine and undertake to correct the error, typically by replacing the <b>bobbin</b> of filler <b>thread</b> in as little time as possible. They are trained that, ideally, no machine should stop working for more than one minute, with faster turn around times being preferred.|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{studies of}} {{movements}} in animals require extensive knowledge of direction, distance {{and frequency of}} movements. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the daily and seasonal movements in a population of the South American rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus. The study population inhabits a cerrado area in southeastern Brazil. Snakes were tracked with externally attached radio-transmitters and <b>thread</b> <b>bobbins.</b> Larger animals tended to make more extensive daily movements, moving further from the initial site of capture. There were no differences in average daily movements between sexes. Site fidelity was higher in the dry season for both sexes. Both sexes moved distances twice as long as those calculated by drawing a straight line between consecutive points. The movement pattern of C. durissus seemed to be similar to that observed in other tropical pit vipers, such as species of the genus Bothrops.

40|$|A new highway {{alignment}} for relocated Route 44 in Carver, Massachusetts, {{resulted in}} the direct alteration of 2. 5 acres and indirect alteration of 3. 9 acres of habitat for three statelisted turtle species: the wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta), spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), and eastern box turtle (Terrapene c. carolina). As part of the mitigation requirements for impacts to rare species habitat, the Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) conducted a two year preconstruction study to determine the habitat preferences and seasonal movements of the statelisted species. The study determined that no wood turtles {{were present in the}} study area, that there was a large but declining population of box turtles, and that two highly used spotted turtle habitats would be bisected by the proposed highway entrance ramp. An intermittent stream channel proposed to be piped under the new entrance ramp was identified as a primary travel corridor between the two habitats. Based on the findings of the preconstruction study, MassHighway identified a simple solution to allow the stream channel to continue to provide a migratory corridor for spotted turtles. To achieve this goal, MassHighway increased the proposed culvert size from a 24 inch pipe to a 6 foot by 6 foot box culvert. In {{the spring and summer of}} 2004, postconstruction monitoring was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the culvert as a spotted turtle crossing structure. Nine turtles were fitted with radio transmitters and <b>thread</b> <b>bobbins</b> and followed three times per week in the spring and early summer, and once per week in the late summer to determine culvert effectiveness. Direct evidence (thread trails, visual observation) was documented for seven turtles, and indirect evidence (radio telemetry points on both sides of the culvert, visual observation) was documented for 13 turtles, confirming the use of the culvert as a crossing structure. A future study is recommended to document potential effects of traffic and noise on the spotted turtle population, continued use of the culvert, and potential changes to rare species habitat from the highway construction...|$|R

Wyróżniając charakterystyczne fazy działania podciągacza, tj. zasilanie nicią oraz wybieranie nici kończące się tzw. zaciąganiem ściegu, zwrócono uwagę na warunki lokowania przeplotu w materiale i możliwość ich poprawiania poprzez budowę podciągacza. Temu celowi służyło modelowanie procesu zaciągania ściegu. Zaprojektowany i zbudowany podciągacz nici pozwolił ponad dwukrotnie obniżyć szczytowe wartości siły zaciągania ściegu, co jest znaczącym osiągnięciem techniczno-technologicznym. Ponadto spowodował spadek strat wytrzymałości nici na zrywanie. Analysis of {{literature}} {{described in the}} dissertation showed the complexity of phenomena of machine stitch creation processes. The reference to the lockstitch proves particularly difficult working conditions of needle thread. Tools forming the stitch (needle, <b>bobbin,</b> needle <b>thread</b> take-up, thread tensioner, transporter of the textile package) cause the weakening of thread inserted into the seam structure, what can lead to thread breakage. Hence, a great {{attention is paid to}} the action on thread of stitch forming mechanisms in the sewing machines. A particular role of thread take-up mechanism was stressed during discussing the process of thread control conditions by the take-up in the lockstitch machines. Characteristic working phases of the take-up were distinguished i. e., supplying by the thread and drawing of thread end during the stitch tightening. One has paid the attention to the conditions of interlacement location in the material and the possibility of correcting them by the improving the structure of the thread take-up mechanism. Changing the stitch tightening modelling process was to achieve this aim. So, a physical model, and next a mathematical model of the zone of stitch creation were elaborated. Due to the possibility of configuration of multibarrier take-ups creation a model of the stitch tightening considering the take-up disc was built. The presented results of model research required the experimental verification. The dynamic tensions in threads and the thread strength decrease after the sewing through process as well as a reaction of the take-up to changes thread length in the link of the stitch were studied. Carrying out the experimental analysis required the building the take-up disc installed on the chosen machine. Thus, {{there is a need for}} elaboration of the methodology of the take-ups disc designing using genetic algorithms as well as a classical programming in Fortan and C++ languages. The determination of requirement take-up disc configuration was preceded by a definition of the curve of the thread controlled by the take-up disc. Next, one made an estimation of defined curve of the thread controlled by take-up disc with a software called "Take-up disc 2. 0 " elaborated on the basis of genetic algorithm. The designed and built thread take-up disc allow decreasing peaks of strength of the stitch tightening over twice of the basic value, which is the significant achievement from a technical-technological point of view. Moreover, it causes the decrease of thread breaking strength losses. In the case of the take-up disc, holding the position of the interlacement in the stitch link on the set level requires the extending the part of machine working cycle corresponding to the stitch tightening in comparison to the generally used take-ups...|$|R
