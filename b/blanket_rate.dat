40|$|The {{back end}} of the line (BEOL) copper (Cu) {{interconnect}} line width and spacing is decreasing with each advancement in technology node. It is important to understand how the decreasing dimensions will impact BEOL chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process. This study is focused on evaluation of Cu CMP using three categories of slurry formulations (i. e. alumina abrasive, silica abrasive and abrasive-less) by utilizing test structures with dimensions relevant to sub- 20 nm technology. The results presented in this study show the key factors driving the performance of slurry formulation (e. g. liner selectivity, defects) are strongly dependent on the copper (Cu) interconnect line width and spacing. The results show the <b>blanket</b> <b>rate</b> selectivity does not translate to equivalent selectivity on patterned structures. In addition, the slurry formulations lost selectivity to liner as interconnect width/spacing is reduced from 40 nm to 32 nm highlighting the need to account for pattern density when predicting selectivity. Furthermore, evaluation of Cu CMP slurry formulations with cobalt (Co) liner indicates that existing formulations exhibit no Cu to Co selectivity. Overall, the results on multiple interconnect dimensions from this study are very important for researchers focused on slurry formulation development and CMP modeling...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{adjustments}} programs (SAPs) in {{the last}} two decades have eliminated all farm-support programs leading to low usage of fertilizers by Kenyan smallholders. One way of addressing this problem is use of organic nutrient resources. This paper examines their cost-effectiveness as capital investments in replenishment of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) and soil organic matter (SOM) in smallholder, Maize-based cropping systems. On-farm trials were established in Maragwa and Kirinyaga Districts in 2003 / 04. Maize was planted in 3 replicates in randomised complete block design (RCBD) using different levels of organic and inorganic fertilizer resources. A <b>blanket</b> <b>rate</b> of 40 kg P/ha was applied in all treatment except the control to increase organic N-utilization efficiency. The test crop was harvested, oven-dried and weighed. Net Present Values (NPV) were computed using Partial Budgeting Analysis Model. Increasing levels of inorganic N increased maize yields significantly (P< 0. 05). However, higher yields were necessary but not sufficient criteria to determine profitability of different treatments. Manure + 60 kg N/ha gave highest NPV (USD 564), Manure + 40 kg N/ha gave second highest NPV (USD 511) in Maragwa District while Manure + 60 kg N/ha gave highest NPV (USD 633) and Manure + 40 kg N/ha second highest NPV (USD 618) in Kirinyaga District. These results suggested that higher N-levels were not necessarily the most economical. Use of organic resources with modest amounts of mineral fertilizers seemed more profitable and held the key to enhancement of nutrient budgets, food security and rural livelihoods.

40|$|Vacuum Beam Studies of Ruthenium EtchingRu {{is known}} to have two {{volatile}} oxidation products, RuO 3 and RuO 4, although the etch rate is negligible when Ru is exposed to an O 2 plasma discharge. The introduction of a small amount of additive gas, such as Cl 2, has been shown to increase the Ru etch rate sixfold. The reason for this dramatic shift in etching is poorly understood, primarily because it is difficult if not impossible to study plasma-surface interactions in a plasma environment. The unique capabilities of the beam system have made it possible to explore the mechanism of Ru etching. It has been shown that under 500 eV Ar+ ion bombardment, the addition of O radicals lowered the etch rate by a factor of 2. 5. This process was relatively insensitive to temperature over the range studied (room temperature to ~ 175 °C). It was also shown that O radicals alone spontaneously etched Ru at a very slow rate over the entire temperature range. Statistical Analysis of Polysilicon Etching and Gate Profile Evolution in Dual-Doped Polysilicon GatesPolysilicon gate etching for the 90 nm lithography node and below requires extremely precise control of the gate CD and profile. Generally speaking, the current requirement for Gate CD control is that the 3 sigma should less than ~ 5 nm for all gates, including across the chip, across the wafer, wafer-to-wafer, lot-to-lot, and tool-to-tool variations. Similarly, for gate sidewall angle control, the 3 sigma angle variation should be less than ~ 1 degree, inclusive of all sources of variation. This is particularly challenging for technologies which employ dual-doped gates, since the chemistry and physics of the etching process induces a different profile evolution between gates with different doping. The goal of this project was to identify a parameter space where the differences in gate profile evolution across different polysilicon dopant types were minimized. <b>Blanket</b> etch <b>rates</b> and patterned wafers were used to determine the effect of different gate etch process variables on the gate profile.

40|$|Drought {{stress and}} sub-optimal soil {{fertility}} management are major constraints to crop production {{in general and}} to cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) in particular in the rain-fed cropping systems in West Africa. Cassava is {{an important source of}} calories for millions of smallholder households in sub-Sahara Africa. The prime aim of this research was to understand cassava productivity in order to contribute to improving yields, food security and farm incomes in rain-fed cassava production systems in West Africa. A long-term goal was to contribute to a decision support tool for site-specific crop and nutrient management recommendations. Firstly, we studied farmers’ perception of cassava production constraints, assessed drivers of diversity among households and analysed the suitability of farmers’ resource endowment groups to the intensification of cassava production. The results indicate that farmers perceived erratic rainfall and poor soil fertility to be prime constraints to cassava production. The agricultural potential of the area and the proximity to regional markets were major drivers for the adoption of crop intensification options including the use of mineral and organic fertilizers. While the use of mineral and organic fertilizers was common in the Maritime zone that had a low agricultural potential, storage roots yields were below the national average of 2. 2 Mg dry matter per hectare, and average incomes of 0. 62, 0. 46 and 0. 46 US$ per capita per day for the high, medium and low farmer resource groups (REGs – HRE, MRE and LRE, respectively) were below the poverty line requirement of 1. 25 US$. In the high agricultural potential Plateaux zone, HRE and MRE households passed this poverty line by earning 2. 58 and 2. 59 US$ per capita per day, respectively, unlike the LRE households with 0. 89 US$ per capita per day. Secondly, we investigated the effects of mineral fertilizer on nutrient uptake, nutrient physiological use efficiency and storage roots yields of cassava since soil fertility was a major issue across the zones. We used an approach based on the model for the Quantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils (QUEFTS). This model was successfully adapted for cassava and it appropriately assessed the response of cassava to N, P and K applications, especially in years with good rainfall. Under high drought stress, the model overestimated cassava yields. Thirdly, we investigated the impact of balanced nutrition on nutrient use efficiency, yield and return on investment compared to blanket fertilizer use as commonly practiced in cassava production systems in Southern Togo, and in Southern and Northern Ghana. The balanced nutrition approach of the QUEFTS model aimed to maximize simultaneously nutrient use efficiency of N, P and K in accordance with the plant’s needs. Larger nutrient use efficiencies of 20. 5 to 23. 9 kg storage root dry matter (DM) per kilo crop nutrient equivalent (1 kCNE of a nutrient is the quantity of that nutrient that has the same effect on yield as 1 kg of N under balanced nutrition conditions) were achieved at balanced nutrition at harvest index (HI) of 0. 50 compared to 20. 0 to 20. 5 kg storage root DM per kilo CNE for the <b>blanket</b> <b>rates</b> recommended by national research services for cassava production. Lower benefit:cost ratios of 2. 4 ± 0. 9 were obtained for the <b>blanket</b> fertilizer <b>rates</b> versus 3. 8 ± 1. 1 for the balanced fertilizer rates. Our study revealed that potassium (K) was a major yield limiting factor for cassava production, especially on the Ferralsols in Southern Togo. Hence, we fourthly studied the effect of K and its interaction with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and the timing of harvest on the productivity of cassava in relation to the effects of K on radiation use efficiency (RUE), light interception, water use efficiency (WUE) and water transpiration. The results suggest that K plays a leading role in RUE and WUE, while N is the leading nutrient for light interception and water transpiration. Potassium effects on RUE and WUE depended on the availability of N and harvest time. Values of RUE and WUE declined with harvest at 4, 8 and 11 months after planting. Thus, enhanced K management with sufficient supply of N during the early stage of development of cassava is needed to maximize RUE and WUE, and consequently attain larger storage root yields. Given that erratic rainfall was another major constraint to cassava production according to the results of the farm survey, and due to the inability of QUEFTS modelling to assess drought effects on cassava yield successfully, another modelling approach based on light interception and utilization (LINTUL) was used. We quantified drought impacts on yields and explored strategies to improve yields through evaluation of planting dates in Southern Togo. The evaluation of the model indicated good agreement between simulated and observed leaf area index (Normalised Root Mean Square Error - NRMSE - 17 % of the average observed LAI), storage roots yields (NRMSE 5. 8 % of the average observed yield) and total biomass yield (NRMSE 5. 8 % of the average observed). Simulated yield losses due to drought ranged from 9 - 60 % of the water-limited yields. The evaluation of planting dates from mid-January to mid-July indicated that the best planting window is around mid-February. Higher amount of cropping season rainfall was also achieved with early planting. These results contradict current practices of starting planting around mid-March to mid-April. However, the results indicate the possibility to increase cassava yields with early planting, which led to less yield losses due to drought. By contrast, late planting around June-July gave larger potential yields, and suggested these periods to be the best planting window for cassava under irrigated conditions in Southern Togo. This shows that appropriate water control and planting periods can contribute to attaining larger yields in Southern Togo. Further improvement of the LINTUL model is required towards using it to assess water-limited yield, which can be used as boundary constraint in QUEFTS to derive site-specific fertilizer requirements for enhanced cassava yield and returns on investments in West Africa...|$|R

However, in the present study at the 24  h of equilibration time, the SPRf of the soils ranged from 50.50 to 154.02  mg P kg− 1 which was equivalent to the application of 115.64 to 352.71  kg P ha− 1 and superior than the blanket recommendation in Ethiopia by about a factor of 6 – 18.The differences in the SPRf of the soils in the study sites indicate that application of <b>blanket</b> P fertilizer <b>rates</b> for all study sites is not feasible.

Soils of the study area were found to have analogous SPRf values with soils appraised by Asmare (2014), where the application of P fertilizers based on the blanket recommendation in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia could result in a substantial yield deficit. Therefore, a mechanism has to be devised to increase availability of P by attenuating the P high adsorption capacity of the soils in order to increase productivity especially for soils with relatively high P fixing capacity (Cheha district).|$|R
40|$|Insufficient and {{unbalanced}} fertiliser use widens cassava yield gaps.

Two datasets comprised of five fertiliser experiments conducted at eight locations across Southern Togo, Southern Ghana and Northern Ghana from 2007 to 2012 were used. The ratio of storage roots dry matter yield over the sum of available N, P and K expressed in crop nutrient equivalent from the soil and nutrient inputs {{was used as a}} proxy to estimate nutrient use efficiency. Nutrient use efficiencies of 20. 5 and 31. 7 kg storage roots dry matter per kilo crop nutrient equivalent were achieved at balanced nutrition at harvest index (HI) values of 0. 50 and 0. 65, respectively. N, P and K supplies of 16. 2, 2. 7 and 11. 5 kg at an HI of 0. 50, and 10. 5, 1. 9 and 8. 4 kg at an HI of 0. 65 were required to produce 1000 kg of storage roots dry matter. The corresponding optimal NPK supply ratios are 6. 0 - 1. 0 - 4. 2 and 5. 3 - 1. 0 - 4. 2. Nutrient use efficiencies decreased above yields of 77 - 93 % of the maximum. Evaluation of the performance of <b>blanket</b> fertiliser <b>rates</b> recommended by national research services for cassava production resulted in average benefit:cost ratios of 2. 4 ± 0. 9, which will be unattractive to many farmers compared to 3. 8 ± 1. 1 for the balanced fertiliser rates. The indigenous soil supply of nutrients revealed that, at balanced nutrition, K was the most limiting nutrient to achieve storage roots yields up to 8 Mg dry matter ha - 1 at most sites, whereas N and P were needed at greater yields. Dry weight of storage roots measured on the control plots in our researcher managed experiment ranged from 5. 6 to 12. 2 Mgha - 1, and were larger than the average weight in farmers' fields in West Africa of 4 Mgha - 1.

30|$|The {{adsorption}} {{study was}} conducted to found the relationship between adsorbed P and solution P to appraise the P adsorption properties of the soils by making use of appropriate empirical model and evaluate the correlation between adsorption indices and soil properties. The Freundlich model could be considered as the best model for the description of the P adsorption characteristics of the soils in this particular study area. The Freundlich coefficient Kf (adsorption capacity) value ranged from 123.32 to 315.31  mg P kg− 1 and depended on amorphous form of Fe and Al (i.e. Feox and Alox). Consequently, the standard P requirements of the soils varied from 50.50 to 154.02  mg P kg− 1 of soil, implying the blanket recommendation of P fertilizer for Ethiopian soils is therefore, inadequate for optimal crop production in the study area and was much below the soils’ actual P requirements. Phosphorous buffer capacity (PBCf) of the soils varied from 140.06 (SD 5) to 342.82  L kg− 1 (SC 1) and all of the premeditated acidic soils (100 %) was classified under very high (>[*] 90) phosphorous buffering capacity soils and would maintain low P supply in soil solution for a longer period. Strong and positive significant relationship was observed between the Freundlich adsorption parameters (Kf, PBCf and SPRf) and oxalate extractable Al and Fe (P[*]≤[*] 0.01). The Freundlich adsorption coefficients play a prominent role in explaining P adsorption characteristics of the soils in terms of oxides of Fe and Al in the study area. The amount of P adsorbed, Phosphorous buffering capacity, standard phosphorous requirement of the soils were best predicted from CEC, Mehlich- 3 P HCl-P, NH 4 Cl-P, clay, Feox, Alox, NaOH-pi and exAl and Pox and therefore put forth a considerate influence on the rate of P adsorbed onto the soils. Therefore, a mechanism has to be devised to increase availability of P by attenuating the P adsorption capacity of the soils in order to increase productivity especially for soils with relatively high P fixing capacity. The <b>blanket</b> P fertilizer <b>rate</b> recommendations in Ethiopia without the knowledge of external P requirement of each crop might have decreased yield in the study areas as it could have resulted in under-application of fertilizer P. Thus it could be inferred that the external and internal P requirement of a crop as well as variety has to be investigated to find a reasonable amount of fertilizer to be applied to a particular soil with respect to crops and sites.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} series of studies related to the characterization and optimization of consumables during Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP). These studies are also evaluated with the purpose of reducing the cost of ownership as well as minimizing the potential environmental impacts. It is well known that pad-wafer contact and pad surface micro-structure have significant impacts on polishing performance. The first study in this dissertation investigates the effect of pad surface contact and topography on polishing performance during copper CMP. Two different types of diamond discs (3 M A 2810 disc and MMC TRD disc) are used to condition the polishing pad. Pad surface contact area and topography are analyzed using laser confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to illustrate how variations in pad surface micro-texture affect the copper removal rate and the coefficient of friction (COF). Polishing results show that the 3 M A 2810 disc generates significantly higher COF (16 %) and removal rate (39 %) than the MMC TRD disc. Pad surface analysis results show that the 3 M A 2810 disc and MMC TRD disc generate similar pad surface height probability density function and pad surface abruptness. On the other hand, the MMC TRD disc generates large flat near contact areas that correspond to fractured and collapsed pore walls while the 3 M A 2810 disc generates solid contact area and clear pore structures. The fractured and collapsed pore walls generated by the MMC TRD disc partly cover the adjacent pores, making the pad surface more lubricated during wafer polishing and resulting in a significantly lower COF and removal rate. In the next study, the individual "large" pad surface contact areas are differentiated from the "small" contact areas and their role in copper CMP is investigated. Surface topography and the structure of a typical individual large contact area are examined via laser confocal microscopy and SEM. In addition, the Young's Modulus of the pad surface material is simulated. A case study is presented to illustrate the role of the individual large contact area of IC 1000 K-groove pad in copper CMP. SEM analysis shows that the individual large pad surface contact areas are induced by fractured pore walls and loosely attached pad debris. Simulation results indicate that individual large contact areas correspond to very low values of the Young's modulus (about 50 MPa). Such low values indicate that the pad material is soft and the summit underlying the individual large contact is not fully supported. As a result, individual large contact area implies low contact pressure and may contribute little to removal rate. Case study results confirm that the individual large contact area has minimal contribution to removal rate and indicate that the removal rate is mainly caused by small individual contact areas. In our case, small contact areas correspond to those smaller than 9 square microns. We believe that this methodology can be also applied for other kinds of pad, although the threshold values that may define "small" and "large" individual contact areas for different pads and processes need to be further investigated. In the third study, the effect of pad surface micro-texture in interlayer dielectric CMP is also investigated. Blanket 200 -mm oxide wafers are polished and the polishing pad is conditioned under two different conditioning forces (26. 7 and 44. 5 N). Results show that when conditioning force is increased from 26. 7 to 44. 5 N, oxide removal rate increases by 65 % while COF increases by only 7 %. Pad surface contact area and topography are measured and analyzed to illustrate their effects on the oxide removal rate. While the two conditioning forces generate similar pad surface abruptness, pad surface contact area is significantly lower (by 71 %) at the conditioning force of 44. 5 N. Such dramatic decrease in pad surface contact area leads to a significant increase in local contact pressure and therefore results in a significant increase in oxide removal rate. The oxide removal rate and local contact pressure exhibits a Prestonian relationship. Besides the above studies on the effect of the pad surface micro-texture during blanket wafer polishing, the fourth study investigates how pad micro-texture affects dishing and erosion during shallow trench isolation (STI) patterned wafer polishing. Two different types of diamond discs (3 M A 2810 disc and MMC TRD disc) are used to condition the pad during wafer polishing. Dishing and erosion analysis for the patterned wafer polishing is performed using a surface profiler. To illustrate the effect of pad surface micro-texture on dishing and erosion, pad surface abruptness and mean pad summit curvature are analyzed using laser confocal microscopy. Polishing results show that the two discs generate similar <b>blanket</b> wafer removal <b>rates,</b> while the MMC TRD disc generate significantly higher dishing and erosion than the 3 M A 2810 disc during patterned wafer polishing. Results of pad surface micro-texture analysis show that the MMC TRD disc generates sharper asperities with higher mean pad summit curvature than the 3 M A 2810 disc, resulting in higher dishing and erosion. Another contribution of this dissertation is the development of a slurry film thickness quantification technique using ultraviolet-enhanced fluorescence. The technique is developed to measure slurry film thickness at any location of interest. In the next study of this dissertation, this new technique is applied to determine how two different slurry application/injection schemes (standard pad center area application method and novel slurry injection system) along with various polishing conditions such as sliding velocity, ring pressure and slurry flow rate affect slurry availability in the bow wave region of the polisher. For the standard pad center area application method, slurry is directly applied onto the pad center area and a large amount of fresh slurry flow directly off the pad surface without flowing to the pad-retaining ring interface due to the centrifugal forces. For the novel slurry injection system, slurry is introduced through an injector that is placed adjacent (< 3 cm) to the retaining ring on the pad surface. Such a close distance between the injector and retaining ring allows most of the fresh slurry to be delivered efficiently to {{the leading edge of the}} retaining ring after it is injected onto the pad surface. Results show that the novel slurry injection system generates consistently thicker bow waves (up to 104 percent) at different sliding velocities, slurry flow rates and ring pressures, therefore providing more slurry availability for the pad-retaining ring interface and potentials for slurry consumption reduction in CMP processes. First order calculations yield estimates of slurry savings associated with the novel slurry injection system ranging between 8 and 48 percent depending on specific process conditions. In the last study of this dissertation, the effect of retaining ring slot design and polishing conditions on slurry flow dynamics at the bow wave is investigated. The ultraviolet-enhanced fluorescence technique is employed to measure the slurry film thickness at the bow wave for two retaining rings with different slot designs. Multiple sliding velocities, slurry flow rates and ring pressures are investigated. Results show that the retaining ring with the sharp angle slot design (PEEK- 1) generates significantly thicker (on average 48 %) slurry films at the bow wave than PEEK- 2 which has a rounded angle slot design. For PEEK- 1, film thickness at the bow wave increases with the increasing of flow rate and ring pressure and decreases with the increasing of sliding velocity. On the other hand, film thickness at bow wave does not change significantly for the PEEK- 2 ring at different polishing conditions indicating an apparent robustness of the PEEK- 2 design to various operating conditions. With retaining rings having different designs, and all else being the same, a thinner bow wave is preferred since it is indicative of a ring design that allows more slurry to flow into the pad-wafer interface. Therefore, the work underscores the importance of optimizing retaining ring slot design and polishing conditions for efficient slurry utilization...|$|R
