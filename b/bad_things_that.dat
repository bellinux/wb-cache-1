25|$|Other {{studies have}} {{examined}} specific subgroups of Mormon women. A study by Ann Pritt in 1998 found that Mormon women who were sexually abused {{were more likely to}} feel distant from God, blame themselves for <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> happen to them, and be more pessimistic in general compared to Mormon women who were not sexually abused (with both parties having received counseling at some point). Another study by Jacobsen and Wright in 2014 found that Mormon women who experience same-sex attraction feel isolation and worthlessness and need to form a positive self-identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{album cover}} is an {{illustration}} (in pencil) by artist Nick Price, {{who had also}} designed the cover for the programme for her 1979 tour. Bush {{was pleased with the}} results (it depicts a multitude of animals and monsters emerging from under her skirt). Of the concept, Bush said that it reflects the title, depicting good and <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> emerge from you. The album was released on compact disc in Japan in 1987 with the cover art modified. A section of the original cover art was enlarged, creating two different booklet covers: the outer one modified; and underneath the original. The album's cover was voted 'Greatest Album Cover of 1980' by Record Mirror.|$|E
500|$|Executives who {{eventually}} {{escaped from the}} Hole have said that its occupants were forced to practice group confessions {{in which they would}} confess supposed transgressions against Miscavige, bad thoughts that they had had about Scientology and disclose their sexual fantasies. Debbie Cook, who spent seven weeks in the Hole in 2007, said that [...] "most of the time the activities [...] were either you confessing your own sins or <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> you'd done, or getting other people to confess theirs." [...] Mike Rinder commented on the bizarre personal dynamics of the Hole: [...] "These were your friends, people you had traveled with. But then, you get in the Hole?

The magazine highlighted alleged crimes committed by foreigners. Arudou, calling the magazine [...] "ignorant propaganda" [...] that [...] "focuses exclusively on the <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> some foreigners do, but has absolutely nothing about crimes committed by Japanese". [...] Arudou posted a bilingual letter for readers to take to FamilyMart stores protesting discrimination against non-Japanese residents of Japan.|$|E

If she is deaf and can't speak, she might at least laugh; depend upon it, those who don't laugh have a bad conscience.' At first the King paid no heed to her words, but the old woman harped so long on the subject, and accused the young Queen of so many <b>bad</b> <b>things,</b> <b>that</b> at last he let himself be talked over, and condemned his beautiful wife to death.|$|E

I declare to you that I literally blushed for my country; I did indeed. It was useless to say anything then, but it was quite clear that there was nothing that one of them could eat.

60|$|Uncle Ebenezer trudged in the ditch, jogging {{from side}} to side like an old ploughman coming home from work. He never said a word the whole way; and I was thrown for talk on the cabin-boy. He told me his name was Ransome, and that he had {{followed}} the sea since he was nine, but could not say how old he was, as he had lost his reckoning. He showed me tattoo marks, baring his breast in the teeth of the wind and in spite of my remonstrances, for I thought it was enough to kill him; he swore horribly whenever he remembered, but more like a silly schoolboy than a man; and boasted of many wild and <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> he had done: stealthy thefts, false accusations, ay, and even murder; but all with such a dearth of likelihood in the details, and such a weak and crazy swagger in the delivery, as disposed me rather to pity than to believe him.|$|E
6000|$|All the same, if the {{communication}} in the Reverberator let them down, at the hotel, more gently than had seemed likely and bristled so much less than {{was to have been}} feared with explanations of the anguish of the Proberts, this didn't diminish the girl's sense of responsibility nor make the case a whit less grave. It only showed how sensitive and fastidious the Proberts were and therefore with what difficulty they would come round to condonation. Moreover Francie made another reflexion as she lay there--for Delia kept her in bed nearly three days, feeling this to be for the moment at any rate an effectual reply to any absurd heroics about leaving Paris. Perhaps they had got [...] "case-hardened" [...] Francie said to herself; perhaps they had read so many such <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they had lost the delicacy of their palate, as people were said to do who lived on food too violently spiced. Then, very weak and vague and passive as she was now, in the bedimmed room, in the soft Parisian bed and with Delia treating her as much as possible like a sick person, she thought of the lively and chatty letters they had always seen in the papers and wondered if they ALL meant a violation of sanctities, a convulsion of homes, a burning of smitten faces, a rupture of girls' engagements. It was present to her as an agreeable negative, I must add, that her father and sister took no strenuous view of her responsibility or of their own: they neither brought the matter home to her as a crime nor made her worse through her feeling them anxiously understate their blame. There was a pleasant cheerful helplessness in her father on this head as on every other. There could be no more discussion among them on such a question than there had ever been, for none was needed to show that for these candid minds the newspapers and all they contained were a part of the general fatality of things, of the recurrent freshness of the universe, coming out like the sun in the morning or the stars at night or the wind and the weather at all times.|$|E
