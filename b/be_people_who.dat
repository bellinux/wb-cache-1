Yet it is as comedy, rather than mystery, that it must stand or fall. Miss Lockwood, though born to be sincere, has the job here of hauling rather substantial red herrings all over the stage to try and give us the impression that she is a sly minx who has either done the deed herself or else is shielding her neurotic little stepdaughter. Tonight's audience evidently fell deeply for the wiles of Miss Lockwood.

They added [...] "Perkins has selflessly shared the good lines around the great cast, {{and there are lots}} of guest stars to look forward to later in the series, including Sue's partner in cake, Mel.

2500|$|Also {{published}} on 26 February 2015 was Kate Lampard's report into {{lessons to be}} learned from the health service's handling of the Savile scandal. [...] She concluded that:"Savile was a highly unusual personality whose lifestyle, behaviour and offending patterns were equally unusual. As a result of his celebrity, his volunteering, and his fundraising he had exceptional access to a number of NHS hospitals and took the opportunities that that access gave him to abuse patients, staff and others on a remarkable scale. Savile’s celebrity and his roles as a volunteer and fundraiser also gave him power and influence within NHS hospitals which meant that his behaviour, which was often evidently inappropriate, was not challenged as it should have been. Savile’s ability to continue to pursue his activities without effective challenge was aided by fragmented hospital management arrangements; social attitudes of the times, including reticence in reporting and accepting reports of sexual harassment and abuse, and greater deference than today towards those in positions of influence and power; and less bold and intrusive media reporting. [...] While it might be tempting to dismiss the Savile case as wholly exceptional, a unique result of a perfect storm of circumstances, the evidence we have gathered indicates that there are many elements of the Savile story that could be repeated in the future. There is always a risk of the abuse, including sexual abuse, of people in hospitals. There will always <b>be</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> seek to gain undue influence and power within public institutions including in hospitals. And society and individuals continue to have a weakness for celebrities. Hospital organisations {{need to be aware of}} the risks posed by these ...|$|E

[...] It went on to say [...] "In North Carolina, we continue to <b>be</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> take our religious beliefs and practices very seriously. But we no longer live in the Bible Belt. Today, we live in the Bible-Talmud-Qur'an-Veda-Dhammapada-Guru Granth Sahib-Kitabi Iqan Belt. It is imperative for our civic leaders, school teachers, judges, and law enforcers to appreciate and respect the religious differences found in our population." [...] The executive director of FaithAction (an interfaith organization) Rev. Mark Sills, signed the letter and said that the Qur'an oath case [...] "struck us as an issue that needs to be confronted". He asked Christians to {{imagine what it would be}} like to live in a place where the Bible was not allowed for oaths, saying [...] "That just feels like a slap in the face." [...] Rev. Julie Peeples, pastor of Greensboro's Congregational United Church of Christ, signed the letter and said [...] "I think it's an opportunity to foster greater respect for all the traditions we have in Greensboro."
