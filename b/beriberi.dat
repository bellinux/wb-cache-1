5|$|As a prisoner, he battled starvation, {{receiving}} {{only a small}} meal of mush {{served in}} a tin cup—a utensil he kept {{for the rest of}} his life. With a weight below , Buckles developed <b>beriberi,</b> and led fellow captives in calisthenics to counter the effects of imprisonment. Their captors showed little mercy, but Buckles was allowed to grow a small garden, which he often used to help feed children who were imprisoned there.|$|E
5|$|Other {{conditions}} that are closely linked to cerebellar degeneration include the idiopathic progressive neurological disorders multiple system atrophy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I, and the autoimmune disorder paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, in which tumors elsewhere in the body elicit an autoimmune response that causes neuronal loss in the cerebellum. Cerebellar atrophy can result from an acute deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) as seen in <b>beriberi</b> and in Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, or from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Well-known human vitamin {{deficiencies}} involve thiamine (<b>beriberi),</b> niacin (pellagra), vitamin C (scurvy), {{and vitamin}} D (rickets). In {{much of the}} developed world, such deficiencies are rare; {{this is due to}} (1) an adequate supply of food and (2) the addition of vitamins and minerals to common foods (fortification). In addition to these classical vitamin deficiency diseases, some evidence has also suggested links between vitamin deficiency and a number of different disorders.|$|E
5|$|In his Essential Medical Treasures of the Golden Chamber (Jinkui yaolue), Zhang Zhongjing (c. 150– c. 219 CE) was {{the first}} to suggest a {{regulated}} diet rich in certain vitamins could prevent different types of disease, an idea which led Hu Sihui (fl. 1314–1330 CE) to prescribe a diet rich in Vitamin B1 as a treatment for <b>beriberi.</b> Zhang's major work was the Treatise on Cold Injury and Miscellaneous Disorders (Shanghan zabing lun). His contemporary and alleged associate Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was a physician who had studied the Huangdi neijing and became knowledgeable in Chinese herbology. Hua Tuo used anesthesia on patients during surgery and created an ointment that was meant to fully heal surgery wounds within a month. In one diagnosis of an ill woman, he deciphered that she bore a dead fetus within her womb which he then removed, curing her of her ailments.|$|E
25|$|In 1907 a {{laboratory}} animal model which {{would help to}} isolate and identify the antiscorbutic factor was discovered: Axel Holst and Theodor Frølich, two Norwegian physicians studying shipboard <b>beriberi</b> in the Norwegian fishing fleet, wanted a small test mammal to substitute for the pigeons then used in <b>beriberi</b> research. They fed guinea pigs their test diet of grains and flour, which had earlier produced <b>beriberi</b> in their pigeons, and were surprised when classic scurvy resulted instead.|$|E
25|$|Well-known syndromes {{caused by}} {{thiamine}} deficiency include <b>beriberi,</b> Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and optic neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{sulbutiamine}} is {{closely tied to}} the study of thiamine in Japan. A deficiency of thiamine causes a nervous system disorder called <b>beriberi.</b> Until the twentieth century, <b>beriberi</b> was prevalent in Japan and other Asian countries due to the widespread dependence on white rice as a staple food. The relationship between <b>beriberi</b> and diet was first noted by a navy surgeon named Takaki Kanehiro. Additional work resulted in the discovery of thiamine, which was isolated in 1926 and synthesized in 1936. The establishment of a Vitamin B Research Committee in Japan led to additional scientific investigation into the properties of thiamine and its derivatives.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, Eugen Baumann {{observed}} iodine in thyroid glands. In 1897, Christiaan Eijkman {{worked with}} natives of Java, who also suffered from <b>beriberi.</b> Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed {{the symptoms of}} <b>beriberi</b> but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice, discovering that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B1, also known as thiamine.|$|E
25|$|Uncooked bracken {{contains}} the enzyme thiaminase, which breaks down thiamine. Eating excessive quantities of bracken can cause <b>beriberi,</b> especially in creatures with simple stomachs. Ruminants are less vulnerable because they synthesize thiamine.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{connection to}} grain {{was made in}} 1897 by Christiaan Eijkman (1858–1930), a military doctor in the Dutch Indies, discovered that fowl fed on a diet of cooked, polished rice developed paralysis, which could be reversed by discontinuing rice polishing. He attributed <b>beriberi</b> to a nerve poison in the endosperm of rice, from which the outer layers of the grain gave protection to the body. An associate, Gerrit Grijns (1865–1944), correctly interpreted the connection between excessive consumption of polished rice and <b>beriberi</b> in 1901: He concluded that rice contains an essential nutrient in the outer layers of the grain that is removed by polishing.|$|E
25|$|Transketolase {{activity}} is decreased in deficiency of thiamine, which {{in general is}} due to malnutrition. Several diseases are associated with thiamine deficiency, including <b>beriberi,</b> Biotin-Thiamine-Responsive Basal Ganglia Disease, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and others (see thiamine for a comprehensive listing).|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} DNA {{damage caused by}} ptaquiloside it is shown that {{chemicals}} in the fern can damage blood cells and can destroy Vitamin B1. This in turn causes <b>beriberi,</b> a disease normally linked to nutritional deficiency.|$|E
25|$|The {{lingering}} {{symptoms of}} neuropathy associated with cerebral <b>beriberi</b> {{are known as}} Korsakoff's syndrome, or the chronic phase of Wernicke-Korsakoff's. Wernicke encephalopathy is a neurological disorder resulting from a deficiency in thiamine, sharing the same predominant features of cerebral <b>beriberi,</b> as characterized by ocular abnormalities, ataxia of gait, a global state of confusion, and neuropathy. The state of confusion associated with Wernicke's may consist of apathy, inattention, spatial disorientation, inability to concentrate, and mental sluggishness or restlessness. Clinical diagnosis of Wernicke's disease cannot be made without evidence of ocular disturbance, yet these criteria may be too rigid. Korsakoff's likely represents {{a variation in the}} clinical manifestation of Wernicke encephalophathy, as they both share similar pathological origin.|$|E
25|$|This {{alone would}} not have ended the conflict, {{if it were not}} because there was a <b>beriberi</b> and yellow fever {{outbreak}} within the Peruvian army in the area, causing a great number of casualties. For now the conflict was resolved, but it would again surface in 1934 with the Colombia–Peru War.|$|E
25|$|Casimir Funk, {{who helped}} {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} thiamin in the etiology of <b>beriberi,</b> was an early investigator {{of the problem of}} pellagra. Funk suggested that a change in the method of milling corn was responsible for the outbreak of pellagra, but no attention was paid to his article on this subject.|$|E
25|$|Scurvy {{is one of}} the {{accompanying}} diseases of malnutrition (other such micronutrient deficiencies are <b>beriberi</b> or pellagra) and thus is still widespread in areas of the world depending on external food aid. Although rare, there are also documented cases of scurvy due to poor dietary choices by people living in industrialized nations.|$|E
25|$|To {{confirm the}} diagnosis, a {{physician}} must rule out other causes of similar clinical syndromes. Other neuropathies can be differentiated {{on the basis}} of typical clinical or laboratory features. Differential diagnoses to alcoholic polyneuropathy include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, <b>beriberi,</b> Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, diabetic lumbosacral plexopathy, Guillain Barre Syndrome, diabetic neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex and post-polio syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Java Man was {{discovered}} by Eugène Dubois in 1891. Komodo dragon was first described by Peter Ouwens in 1912, after an aeroplane crash accident in 1911 and rumours about living dinosaurs in Komodo Island in 1910. Vitamin B1 {{and its relation to}} <b>beriberi</b> disease {{was discovered}} by Eijkman during his work in the Indies.|$|E
25|$|Thiamine, {{also known}} as thiamin or vitamin B1, is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary {{supplement}}. As a supplement {{it is used to}} treat and prevent thiamine deficiency and disorders that result from it, including <b>beriberi,</b> Korsakoff's syndrome, and Korsakoff's psychosis. Other uses include maple syrup urine disease and Leigh's disease. It is taken by mouth or by injection.|$|E
25|$|As a result, it {{is likely}} that the deaths of Burke and Wills {{resulted}} in part from a vitamin deficiency disease called <b>beriberi.</b> Evidence to this effect is further provided by King's account, which revealed that Burke complained of leg and back pain shortly before his death. However, other research suggests that scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) and environmental factors also contributed to their deaths.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Kanehiro Takaki {{observed}} that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted {{almost entirely of}} white rice) developed <b>beriberi</b> (or endemic neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease, (not because of the increased protein as Takaki supposed but because it introduced a few parts per million of thiamine to the diet, later understood as a cure).|$|E
25|$|The {{seeds of}} the rice plant are first milled using a rice huller to remove the chaff (the outer husks of the grain). At {{this point in the}} process, the product is called brown rice. The milling may be continued, {{removing}} the bran, i.e., the rest of the husk and the germ, thereby creating white rice. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the disease <b>beriberi.</b>|$|E
25|$|Victims of {{starvation}} are often {{too weak to}} sense thirst, and therefore become dehydrated. All movements become painful due to muscle atrophy and dry, cracked skin that is caused by severe dehydration. With a weakened body, diseases are commonplace. Fungi, for example, often grow under the esophagus, making swallowing painful. Vitamin deficiency is also a common result {{of starvation}}, often leading to anemia, <b>beriberi,</b> pellagra, and scurvy. These diseases collectively can also cause diarrhea, skin rashes, edema, and heart failure. Individuals are often irritable and lethargic as a result.|$|E
25|$|From {{the middle}} of the 18th century, it was noted that lemon and lime juice could help prevent sailors from getting scurvy. At first, it was {{supposed}} that the acid properties were responsible for this benefit; however, {{it soon became clear that}} other dietary acids, such as vinegar, had no such benefits. In 1907, two Norwegian physicians reported an essential disease-preventing compound in foods that was distinct from the one that prevented <b>beriberi.</b> These physicians were investigating dietary-deficiency diseases using the new animal model of guinea pigs, which are susceptible to scurvy. The newly discovered food-factor was eventually called vitamin C.|$|E
25|$|John Cutting Berry, another missionary of the American Board, {{directed}} {{not only}} the International Hospital of Kobe but also Kobe Hospital, and was energetic in his medical practice in Kobe, Himeji, and Sanda. In January 1873, Berry conducted the first human dissection in the prefecture at Kobe Hospital. He visited Kobe's prison in 1877, on the prefecture's request, {{in response to an}} outbreak of <b>beriberi</b> within, and saw with his own eyes the unsanitary conditions and inhumane treatment of prisoners there. He pushed the prefecture to reform its prison system, and many other missionaries followed him in visiting the prisons and presenting plans to the government for their reform.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, {{the wheat}} {{industry}} began to adopt voluntary widespread enrichment (fortification) of wheat flour with vitamins, folic acid, and iron, {{the outcome of}} a recommendation by the National Nutrition Conference for Defense, charged with investigating the causes of poor health among many World War II recruits. By 1942, some 75 percent of breads in the United States were fortified. Mandatory fortification requirements went into effect in 1943, following the publication of the first U.S. government recommended dietary allowances. The removal of naturally occurring nutrients that occurs in grain processing led to a number of diseases caused by nutritional deficiency, including <b>beriberi,</b> pellagra, neural tube defect, and iron deficiency anemia. Enrichment helped eradicate or reduce the frequency of these conditions in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The first {{description}} of symptoms associated with alcoholic polyneuropathy were recorded by John C. Lettsome in 1787 when he noted hyperesthesia and paralysis in legs more than arms of patients. Jackson {{has also been}} credited with describing polyneuropathy in chronic alcoholics in 1822. The clinical title of alcoholic polyneuropathy was widely recognized by the late nineteenth century. It was thought that the polyneuropathy was {{a direct result of}} the toxic effect alcohol had on peripheral nerves when used excessively. In 1928, George C. Shattuck argued that the polyneuropathy resulted from a vitamin B deficiency commonly found in alcoholics and he claimed that alcoholic polyneuropathy should be related to <b>beriberi.</b> This debate continues today over what exactly causes this disease, some argue it is just the alcohol toxicity, others claim the vitamin deficiencies are to blame and still others say it is some combination of the two.|$|E
500|$|In East Asia, where {{polished}} {{white rice}} was the common staple food {{of the middle}} class, <b>beriberi</b> resulting from lack of vitamin B1 was endemic. In 1884, Takaki Kanehiro, a British trained medical doctor of the Imperial Japanese Navy, observed that <b>beriberi</b> was endemic among low-ranking crew who often ate nothing but rice, but not among officers who consumed a Western-style diet. With {{the support of the}} Japanese navy, he experimented using crews of two battleships; one crew was fed only white rice, while the other was fed a diet of meat, fish, barley, rice, and beans. The group that ate only white rice documented 161 crew members with <b>beriberi</b> and 25 deaths, while the latter group had only 14 cases of <b>beriberi</b> and no deaths. This convinced Takaki and the Japanese Navy that diet was the cause of <b>beriberi,</b> but they mistakenly believed that sufficient amounts of protein prevented it. That diseases could result from some dietary deficiencies was further investigated by Christiaan Eijkman, who in 1897 discovered that feeding unpolished rice instead of the polished variety to chickens helped to prevent <b>beriberi</b> in the chickens. The following year, Frederick Hopkins postulated that some foods contained [...] "accessory factors"— in addition to proteins, carbohydrates, fats etc.— that are necessary for the functions of the human body. Hopkins and Eijkman were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1929 for their discoveries.|$|E
500|$|On New Year's Day of 1894, Sakakibara {{passed on}} the Jikishinkage headmastership to his disciple Jirōkichi Yamada. Sakakibara died of heart failure due to <b>beriberi</b> on 11 September the same year, {{at the age of}} 63. He was entombed at Saiō-ji temple Yotsuya, Tokyo and given the posthumous Buddhist name [...] In 2003 he was {{inducted}} into the All Japan Kendo Federation's [...]|$|E
500|$|The term vitamin {{was derived}} from [...] "vitamine", a {{compound}} word coined in 1912 by the Polish biochemist Kazimierz Funk when working at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine. The name is from vital and amine, meaning amine of life, because it was suggested in 1912 that the organic micronutrient food factors that prevent <b>beriberi</b> and perhaps other similar dietary-deficiency diseases might be chemical amines. This was true of thiamine, but after {{it was found that}} other such micronutrients were not amines the word was shortened to vitamin in English.|$|E
500|$|Another {{concern was}} the health and medical care of the internees. [...] Although medical {{facilities}} were inadequate, the internees counted amongst them about 40 doctors, two dentists, six pharmacists, 100 trained nurses, {{and a large number}} of volunteer auxiliary nurses. Because of this, according to historian G. B. Endacott, no major epidemic occurred. The most common sickness amongst the internees were malaria, malnutrition and its associated diseases, <b>beriberi,</b> and pellagra. [...] The shortage of medical supplies and equipment posed a challenge for those in charge of medical care, with the lack of soap and disinfectant being a particularly troublesome concern.|$|E
500|$|The serow {{has long}} been hunted in Japan, {{especially}} in northern Japan where, along with bear-hunting, serow-hunting was strongly associated with matagi culture. [...] Throughout Japan's mountainous regions the serow has been a valued catch, its various body parts used without waste. [...] Prized in particular its meat—until the mid-20th century serow meat was so widely eaten in these regions the animal itself was known as [...] "meat". [...] Its waterproof hides were used for rafters' backflaps, its horns were ground as a preventative against diseases such as <b>beriberi,</b> and a cure for stomachaches was made from the serow's small intestines and gall bladder.|$|E
500|$|By May, Belgian numbers {{had risen}} to 2,500 men, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Leopold Dronkers-Martens. The rainy season had begun, turning the main road from Sudan into mud, cutting off their {{communications}} and supplies. The Baro and Sobat rivers were still too low to permit the passage of supply barges from the White Nile, and the nearby Gambela airfield was too small for transport aircraft to land. The only means of supply was by airdrop, forcing the Belgians and Congolese to halve their rations. Several porters attempted to bring food in by foot [...] from Sudan, but died of fatigue and undernourishment. Some of the officers resorted to stripping the camouflage netting from their trucks and seining the Baro River for fish amid frequent outbreaks of <b>Beriberi.</b> The Italians, encamped on fertile soil and well supplied, faced no such problems. The Belgians were also subject to regular air attack.|$|E

500|$|Crewmen aboard Minas Geraes began {{planning}} for a revolt years before 1910, according to João Cândido Felisberto, an experienced sailor who would later become {{the leader of the}} Revolt of the Lash. The conspirators were motivated by the treatment of enlisted men in the Brazilian Navy, extending beyond the lash to even their substandard food, which led to not-uncommon outbreaks of <b>beriberi.</b> Some had formed a committee and had been meeting secretly for years in Rio de Janeiro. This semi-formal organization was only expanded when they were sent to Newcastle in the United Kingdom for training—the operation of such large and complex warships required specific skills. When interviewed years after the mutiny, Felisberto said that they [...] "maintained the committees in the very hotels where we were residing, awaiting the construction of the ships. Almost two years paid by the Brazilian government, we sent messengers to sound out the situation here [...] We did this so that when we arrive, we would be prepared to act"—they were just [...] "waiting for a date and for power," [...] referring to the brand-new warships.|$|E
2500|$|The {{body has}} only small stores of B1; accordingly, there is risk of {{deficiency}} if {{the level of}} intake is reduced {{only for a few}} weeks. Thiamin deficiency during critical periods of early development can disrupts neurogenesis in animal models.

Dry <b>beriberi</b> is also known as cerebral <b>beriberi.</b> Characteristics of wet <b>beriberi</b> include prominent edema and cardiac involvement, whereas dry <b>beriberi</b> is mainly characterized by a polyneuritis. Severe thiamin deficiency can also result in acute neurodegeneration leading to peripheral neuropathy and memory loss.|$|E
