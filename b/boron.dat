5|$|Elemental <b>boron</b> is a {{metalloid}} that {{is found}} in small amounts in meteoroids but chemically uncombined <b>boron</b> is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure <b>boron</b> is produced with difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or other elements. Several allotropes of <b>boron</b> exist: amorphous <b>boron</b> is a brown powder; crystalline <b>boron</b> is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature. The primary use of elemental <b>boron</b> is as <b>boron</b> filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{average cost}} of {{crystalline}} <b>boron</b> is $5/g. Free <b>boron</b> is chiefly used in making <b>boron</b> fibers, where it is deposited by chemical vapor deposition on a tungsten core (see below). <b>Boron</b> fibers are used in lightweight composite applications, such as high strength tapes. This use {{is a very small}} fraction of total <b>boron</b> use. <b>Boron</b> is introduced into semiconductors as <b>boron</b> compounds, by ion implantation.|$|E
5|$|The major global industrial-scale use of <b>boron</b> {{compounds}} (about 46% of end-use) is {{in production}} of glass fiber for boron-containing insulating and structural fiberglasses, especially in Asia. <b>Boron</b> {{is added to}} the glass as borax pentahydrate or <b>boron</b> oxide, to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers. Another 10% of global <b>boron</b> production is for borosilicate glass as used in high strength glassware. About 15% of global <b>boron</b> is used in <b>boron</b> ceramics, including super-hard materials discussed below. Agriculture consumes 11% of global <b>boron</b> production, and bleaches and detergents about 6%.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> carbide and cubic <b>boron</b> nitride powders {{are widely}} used as abrasives. <b>Boron</b> nitride is a {{material}} isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN {{is used as a}} high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. Heterodiamond (also called BCN) is another diamond-like <b>boron</b> compound.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> carbide's {{ability to}} absorb {{neutrons}} without forming long-lived radionuclides (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of <b>boron</b> carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, <b>boron</b> carbide is often powdered, {{to increase its}} surface area.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> fibers (<b>boron</b> filaments) are high-strength, {{lightweight}} {{materials that are}} used chiefly for advanced aerospace structures {{as a component of}} composite materials, as well as limited production consumer and sporting goods such as golf clubs and fishing rods. The fibers can be produced by chemical vapor deposition of <b>boron</b> on a tungsten filament.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> {{interacts with}} carbon interstitials forming a neutral boron–interstitial complex {{with a sharp}} optical {{absorption}} at 0.552 eV (2250 nm). No evidence is known so far (2009) for complexes of <b>boron</b> and vacancy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbolB and atomic number5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae {{and not by}} stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. <b>Boron</b> is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known <b>boron</b> deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of <b>boron</b> minerals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> is {{a useful}} dopant for such {{semiconductors}} as silicon, germanium, and silicon carbide. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in p-type conductivity. Traditional method of introducing <b>boron</b> into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B2O3), liquid (BBr3), or gaseous <b>boron</b> sources (B2H6 or BF3). However, after the 1970s, it was mostly replaced by ion implantation, which relies mostly on BF3 as a <b>boron</b> source. <b>Boron</b> trichloride gas {{is also an important}} chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides. Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a <b>boron</b> source. Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride-boron nitride films, and for doping of diamond film with <b>boron.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> is an {{essential}} plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to <b>boron</b> in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil <b>boron,</b> will show at least some symptoms of <b>boron</b> toxicity when soil <b>boron</b> content is greater than 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> {{is found}} in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often {{associated}} with other elements. More than one hundred borate minerals contain <b>boron</b> in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although <b>boron</b> is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the <b>boron</b> minerals never contain <b>boron</b> with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> is {{primarily}} used in chemical compounds. About {{half of all}} <b>boron</b> consumed globally is an additive in fiberglass for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. <b>Boron</b> compounds are used as fertilizers in agriculture and in sodium perborate bleaches. A small amount of <b>boron</b> {{is used as a}} dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural <b>boron</b> is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> {{is similar}} to carbon in its {{capability}} to form stable covalently bonded molecular networks. Even nominally disordered (amorphous) <b>boron</b> contains regular <b>boron</b> icosahedra which are, however, bonded randomly to each other without long-range order. Crystalline <b>boron</b> is a very hard, black material with a melting point of above 2000°C. It forms four major polymorphs: α-rhombohedral and β-rhombohedral (α-R and β-R), γ and β-tetragonal (β-T); α-tetragonal phase also exists (α-T), but {{is very difficult to}} produce without significant contamination. Most of the phases are based on B12 icosahedra, but the γ-phase can be described as a rocksalt-type arrangement of the icosahedra and B2 atomic pairs. It can be produced by compressing other <b>boron</b> phases to 12–20GPa and heating to 1500–1800°C; it remains stable after releasing the temperature and pressure. The T phase is produced at similar pressures, but higher temperatures of 1800–2200°C. As to the α and β phases, they might both coexist at ambient conditions with the β phase being more stable. Compressing <b>boron</b> above 160GPa produces a <b>boron</b> phase with an as yet unknown structure, and this phase is a superconductor at temperatures 6–12 K. Borospherene (fullerene-like B40) molecules) and borophene (proposed graphene-like structure) have been described in 2014.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> nitride {{exists in}} {{multiple}} forms that {{differ in the}} arrangement of the <b>boron</b> and nitrogen atoms, giving rise to varying bulk properties of the material.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> was not {{recognized}} as an element until it was isolated by Sir Humphry Davy and by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard. In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate {{on one of the}} electrodes. In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough <b>boron</b> to confirm a new element and named the element boracium. Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. By oxidizing <b>boron</b> with air, they showed that boric acid is an oxidation product of <b>boron.</b> Jöns Jakob Berzelius identified <b>boron</b> as an element in 1824. Pure <b>boron</b> was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{containing}} <b>boron</b> as a substitutional impurity are termed type IIb. Only {{one percent}} of natural diamonds are of this type, and most are blue to grey. <b>Boron</b> is an acceptor in diamond: <b>boron</b> atoms have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each <b>boron</b> atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an electron hole in the band gap that can accept an electron from the valence band. This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the valence band, holes can be thermally released from the <b>boron</b> atoms to the valence band even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond electrically conductive (i.e., a p-type semiconductor). Very few <b>boron</b> atoms are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one <b>boron</b> atom per 1,000,000 carbon atoms.|$|E
5|$|Estimated global {{consumption}} of <b>boron</b> (almost entirely as <b>boron</b> compounds) was about 4million tonnes of B2O3 in 2012. <b>Boron</b> mining and refining capacities {{are considered to}} be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that <b>boron</b> plays several {{essential}} roles in animals, including humans, but the exact physiological role is poorly understood. A small human trial published in 1987 reported on postmenopausal women first made <b>boron</b> deficient and then repleted with 3 mg/day. <b>Boron</b> supplementation markedly reduced urinary calcium excretion and elevated the serum concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} on melting {{behavior}} of <b>boron</b> nitride. It sublimates at 2973°C at normal pressure releasing nitrogen gas and <b>boron,</b> but melts at elevated pressure.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} of <b>boron</b> is nonmetallic in nature. Unlike its heavier congeners, {{it is not known}} to form a simple B3+ or hydrated 3+ cation. The small size of the <b>boron</b> atom enables the preparation of many interstitial alloy-type borides. Analogies between <b>boron</b> and transition metals have been noted in the formation of complexes, and adducts (for example, BH3 + CO →BH3CO and, similarly, Fe(CO)4 + CO →Fe(CO)5), {{as well as in the}} geometric and electronic structures of cluster species such as 2− and 2−. The aqueous chemistry of <b>boron</b> is characterised by the formation of many different polyborate anions. Given its high charge-to-size ratio, <b>boron</b> bonds covalently in nearly all of its compounds; the exceptions are the borides as these include, depending on their composition, covalent, ionic and metallic bonding components. Simple binary compounds, such as <b>boron</b> trichloride are Lewis acids as the formation of three covalent bonds leaves a hole in the octet which can be filled by an electron-pair donated by a Lewis base. <b>Boron</b> has a strong affinity for oxygen and a duly extensive borate chemistry. The oxide B2O3 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Organometallic compounds of <b>boron</b> have been known since the 19th century (see organoboron chemistry).|$|E
5|$|Not all {{fiberglass}}es contain <b>boron,</b> but on {{a global}} scale, most of the fiberglass used does contain it. Because the ubiquitous use of fiberglass in construction and insulation, boron-containing fiberglasses consume half the global production of <b>boron,</b> and are the single largest commercial <b>boron</b> market.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide is a semiconductor, {{which can}} be doped n-type by {{nitrogen}} or phosphorus and p-type by beryllium, <b>boron,</b> aluminium, or gallium. Metallic conductivity has been achieved by heavy doping with <b>boron,</b> aluminium or nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|The 10B isotope {{is useful}} for {{capturing}} thermal neutrons (see neutron cross section#Typical cross sections). The nuclear industry enriches natural <b>boron</b> to nearly pure 10B. The less-valuable by-product, depleted <b>boron,</b> is nearly pure 11B.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{routes to}} elemental <b>boron</b> involved {{the reduction of}} boric oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium. However, the product is almost always contaminated with borides of those metals. Pure <b>boron</b> can be prepared by reducing volatile <b>boron</b> halides with hydrogen at high temperatures. Ultrapure <b>boron</b> {{for use in the}} semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified with the zone melting or Czochralski processes.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of <b>boron</b> compounds {{does not involve}} the formation of elemental <b>boron,</b> but exploits the convenient availability of borates.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{chemistry of}} <b>boron</b> {{is dominated by}} its small atomic size, and relatively high ionization energy. With only three valence electrons per <b>boron</b> atom, simple covalent bonding cannot fulfil the octet rule. Metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenors of <b>boron</b> but this generally requires low ionization energies. Instead, because of its small size and high ionization energies, the basic structural unit of <b>boron</b> (and nearly all of its allotropes) is the icosahedral B12 cluster. Of the 36 electrons associated with 12 <b>boron</b> atoms, 26 reside in 13 delocalized molecular orbitals; the other 10 electrons are used to form two- and three-centre covalent bonds between icosahedra. The same motif can be seen, as are deltahedral variants or fragments, in metal borides and hydride derivatives, and in some halides.|$|E
5|$|All {{other forms}} of <b>boron</b> nitride are crystalline.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these are}} not found on Earth naturally, <b>boron</b> forms a variety of stable {{compounds}} with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in <b>boron</b> hydrides and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N2, cannot be isolated in condensed form, but B2F4 and B4Cl4 are well characterized.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the lighter}} metalloids, alloys with {{transition}} metals are well-represented. <b>Boron</b> can form intermetallic compounds and alloys with such metals {{of the composition}} MnB, if n > 2. Ferroboron (15% <b>boron)</b> is used to introduce <b>boron</b> into steel; nickel-boron alloys are ingredients in welding alloys and case hardening compositions for the engineering industry. Alloys of silicon with iron and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries, respectively. Germanium forms many alloys, most importantly with the coinage metals.|$|E
5|$|Amorphous <b>boron</b> {{is used as}} {{a melting}} point {{depressant}} in nickel-chromium braze alloys.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{excellent}} thermal and chemical stability, <b>boron</b> nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. <b>Boron</b> nitride has potential use in nanotechnology. Nanotubes of BN can be produced that have a structure {{similar to that of}} carbon nanotubes, i.e. graphene (or BN) sheets rolled on themselves, but the properties are very different.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{distinctive}} green flame, amorphous <b>boron</b> {{is used in}} pyrotechnic flares.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{extremely}} rigid lattice, it can {{be contaminated}} by very few types of impurities, such as <b>boron</b> and nitrogen. Small amounts of defects or impurities (about one per million of lattice atoms) color diamond blue (<b>boron),</b> yellow (nitrogen), brown (lattice defects), green (radiation exposure), purple, pink, orange or red. Diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion (ability to disperse light of different colors).|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> carbide's {{structure}} is only approximately B4C, {{and it shows}} a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B6) octahedra are present as well (see the <b>boron</b> carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of <b>boron</b> carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other structural applications.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> {{fibers and}} sub-millimeter sized {{crystalline}} <b>boron</b> springs {{are produced by}} laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition. Translation of the focused laser beam allows to produce even complex helical structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties (elastic modulus 450GPa, fracture strain 3.7%, fracture stress 17GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in micromechanical systems.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boron</b> has two {{naturally}} occurring and stable isotopes, 11B (80.1%) and 10B (19.9%). The mass difference {{results in a}} wide range of δ11B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of <b>boron,</b> the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay. It has a half-life of 3.5×10−22 s. Isotopic fractionation of <b>boron</b> is controlled by the exchange reactions of the <b>boron</b> species B(OH)3 and −. <b>Boron</b> isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the − ion onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in 11B(OH)3 and therefore may be responsible for the large 11B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust; this difference may act as an isotopic signature.|$|E
