5|$|A 2007 report {{described}} pathologies in {{the bones}} of Majungasaurus. Scientists examined the remains of at least 21 individuals and discovered four with noticeable pathologies. While pathology had <b>been</b> <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> large tetanuran theropods like allosaurids and tyrannosaurids, {{this was the first}} time an abelisauroid had been examined in this manner. No wounds were found on any skull elements, in contrast to tyrannosaurids where sometimes gruesome facial bites were common. One of the specimens was a phalanx (toe bone) of the foot, which had apparently been broken and subsequently healed.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion, {{when used}} for {{treating}} obesity {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in weight loss of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other medications, such as sibutramine or orlistat. It has <b>been</b> <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> combination with naltrexone.

5|$|Regularity {{and order}} are common {{features}} in Toraja wood carving (see table below), {{as well as}} abstracts and geometrical designs.

5|$|The {{evolution}} of TBR1 has <b>been</b> <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> amphioxi, {{also known as}} lancelets. A T-box-containing cDNA was isolated in the lancelet Branchiostoma belcheri and found to possess a T-domain orthologous {{to that of the}} T-Brain subfamily of T-box genes, specifically TBR1. However, lancelets lack a true brain and no TBR1 transcripts were found in the neural tissue of the lancelet. This suggests that the neuronal role of TBR1 evolved in vertebrates after the lancelet lineage had already diverged from that of vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have <b>been</b> <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E

However, {{the composition of the}} forests has changed, so that there are now more hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer eastern white pine and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state.

5|$|Cockroaches {{are social}} insects; {{a large number}} of species are either gregarious or {{inclined}} to aggregate, and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care. It used to be thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues, but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors. Some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved, while others use glands located on their mandibles. Pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor. The behaviors involved have only <b>been</b> <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> a few species, but German cockroaches leave fecal trails with an odor gradient. Other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food and water, and where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches have emergent behavior, in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.|$|E
