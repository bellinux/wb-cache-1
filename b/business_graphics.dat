5000|$|Graphics {{capability}} was {{not taken}} seriously {{in the original}} IBM design brief; graphics were considered only {{from the perspective of}} generating static <b>business</b> <b>graphics</b> such as charts and graphs. MS-DOS did not have an API for graphics, and the BIOS only included the rudimentary graphics functions such as changing screen modes and plotting single points. To make a BIOS call for every point drawn or modified increased overhead considerably, making the BIOS interface notoriously slow. Because of this, line-drawing, arc-drawing, and blitting had to be performed by the application to achieve acceptable speed, which was usually done by bypassing the BIOS and accessing video memory directly. Software written to address IBM PC hardware directly would run on any IBM clone, but would have to be rewritten especially for each non-PC-compatible MS-DOS machine.|$|E
5000|$|SPC's first product, its [...] "PFS" [...] brand {{database}} for Apple II computers, was reworked, improved, and then released as pfs:File, a flat-file {{database for}} DOS.

While relatively limited in their capabilities compared with better-known and more powerful products like the DOS database dBase III, the DOS spreadsheet Lotus 1-2-3, and the DOS word processor WordPerfect, the trio of SPC products proved popular, because of their simplicity and ease-of-use, with beginning and intermediate DOS PC users.|$|E

The agency would design an ad (or campaign) and pitch it to a client that they wanted to work with. This was done in order to convince the client to sign a long-term contract that would result in work for years to come. While these agencies did not bill for the actual spec work, their contract billing would factor it into the cost.|$|R
