25|$|This new technique, {{also known}} as an {{extended}} mini abdominoplasty, allows for tightening and shaping through a smaller incision that isn't placed around the <b>belly</b> <b>button.</b> Through this smaller incision, excess skin is removed and the <b>belly</b> <b>button</b> is temporarily detached, floating above the muscles during this process. The muscles are tightened and reshaped from sternum to pubic area. The skin is then tightened and the <b>belly</b> <b>button</b> is reattached, or moved down one or two cm if desired. Liposuction may also be performed to achieve desirable results.|$|E

25|$|Georg Steinhauser, {{a chemist}} {{writing in the}} journal Medical Hypotheses, said that small pieces of fluff first form in the hair and then {{end up in the}} navel {{at the end of the}} day. He further said that {{abdominal}} hair often seems to grow in concentric circles around the navel; the scaly structure of the hair enhances the abrasion of minuscule fibres from the shirt and directs the lint towards the <b>belly</b> <b>button.</b> Steinhauser established that shaving one's belly will result in a fluff-free navel but only until the hairs grow back. His other suggestions include wearing old clothes, which tend to shed less lint than newer garments, which can lose up to one-thousandth of their weight to the <b>belly</b> <b>button</b> over the course of a year. A body piercing can also be used, with <b>belly</b> <b>button</b> rings particularly effective at sweeping away fibres before they lodge.|$|E

25|$|Navel lint (also {{known by}} {{names such as}} navel fluff, <b>belly</b> <b>button</b> lint, <b>belly</b> <b>button</b> fluff, and dip lint) is an {{accumulation}} of fluffy fibers in the navel cavity. Many people find that, {{at the beginning and}} end of the day, a small lump of fluff has appeared in the navel cavity. This lint is an accumulation of cloth fibers that are scraped by body hair. The reasons for its accumulation in the navel are a subject of speculation. A likely hypothesis is that rubbing of navel hairs and clothing contributes to a build-up of static electricity, resulting in the collection of clothing fibers and to a lesser extent, dead skin cells.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of bruises {{may be seen}} in patients with platelet or coagulation disorders, or those who are being treated with an anticoagulant. Unexplained bruising may be a warning sign of child abuse, domestic abuse, or serious medical problems such as leukemia or meningoccocal infection. Unexplained bruising can also indicate internal bleeding or certain types of cancer. Long-term glucocorticoid therapy can cause easy bruising. Bruising present around the navel (<b>belly</b> <b>button)</b> with severe abdominal pain suggests acute pancreatitis. Connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome may cause relatively easy or spontaneous bruising depending on the severity.|$|E
50|$|Some Japanese parents {{tell their}} {{children}} to hide their <b>belly</b> <b>buttons</b> (or navels) during thunderstorms.

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their <b>belly</b> <b>button</b> and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Studies in Philosophy and Education, Doret de Ruyter {{approved}} of Levinson's emphasis on autonomy and concurred that Levinson's definition of autonomy would be agreeable to citizens of Western liberal countries. De Ruyter was unsure about edge cases of autonomy, {{such as whether}} being closed-minded to {{the prospect of a}} pierced <b>belly</b> <b>button</b> would make her a less autonomous person in Levinson's view. She also disagreed with Levinson's position of parental [...] "privilege" [...] (rather than right) over their children, and invoked Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld to argue that parents instead have the opposite of a privilege, a [...] "duty", to their children's interests and require the liberty to fulfill it, including through education. To defend this parental duty to children and freedom from society in fulfillment of the duty, de Ruyter cited John Eekelaar's parental duty-right to educate children: a positive right to educate as they see fit and a negative right that prevents others from impeding. She concluded that the state's duty conflicts with the duty of parents and thus the state's duty is [...] "primarily ... against children".|$|E

5000|$|During the 1990s, {{the fashion}} trend among young South Korean women for wearing cropped T-shirts that leave the midriff exposed had started, {{due to the}} hot climatic conditions.

It further became popular due to Korean pop culture, where K-pop stars started wearing body piercings and midriff-exposing shirts.

500|$|The {{rush for}} Madonna's fashion {{started with the}} music video for [...] "Lucky Star". In the video, Madonna wore an all-black outfit with leggings, ankle boots, and <b>belly</b> <b>button,</b> with her tangled hair tied in a floppy black ribbon. This was coupled with a shiny black miniskirt, an earring on her right ear, cut-off gloves and rubber bangles. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was {{credited}} with designing the outfit, although biographer Mary Cross noted that Madonna was after all wearing her day-to-day outfit. Mary Lambert, then a Rhode Island School of Design graduate, was decided for directing the video. However, Arthur Pierson replaced her as the director. Warner Bros. gave Pierson a small budget to make the video, shot in an afternoon. Madonna's brother, Christopher Ciccone, is a back-up dancer in the video. In his book Life with My Sister Madonna he says that although he was only paid $200 to dance in the video, {{at the time he}} was [...] "just happy to be part of it." [...] The video starts with the close-up of Madonna's face, as she slides her sunglasses down her nose. This scene was a reference to the character of Lolita in Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film of the same name, and Audrey Hepburn in the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961). The image then fades to white, denoting the celestial stars dazzle, and then resumes itself in color. Madonna is shown dancing against a stark white background, along with closeups of her mesmerised gaze. She is accompanied by Belle and brother Christopher, as backup dancers. The video ends with the initial black-and-white image repeated, but in retrograde, as Madonna puts back on the sunglasses. The taking down and putting up of those sunglasses provided a frame to contain the song, functioning like a curtain that marks the opening and closing of a stage performance.|$|E

Magazines and TV shows ran lookalike competitions." [...] This frenzy regarding Madonna {{gave rise to a}} new term called Madonna wannabe—a word that was ultimately officially recognized by the Webster's Dictionary in May 1991. Madonna was mystified as to why all the women would want to copy her look. She commented,"I never set out to be a role model. I am a strong woman, a successful woman, and I don't conform to a stereotype. For so long women have been told that there are certain ways they mustn't look if they want to get ahead in life.
