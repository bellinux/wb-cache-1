5|$|The artwork for X was {{designed}} by graphic design duo Tappin Gofton, formed by Mark Tappin and Simon Gofton; Mark Tappin had previously worked for Coldplay on the Parachutes album cover and the covers of the singles therefrom. The image, which is visualized {{through a combination of}} colours and blocks, is a graphical representation of the <b>Baudot</b> code, an early form of telegraph communication using a series of ones and zeros to communicate. The code was developed by Frenchman Émile <b>Baudot</b> in the 1870s, and was a widely used method of terrestrial and telegraph communication.|$|E
5|$|X (stylized as X & Y) is {{the third}} studio album by the British rock band Coldplay. It was {{released}} on 6 June 2005 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom, and a day later by Capitol Records in the United States. The album was produced by Coldplay and producer Danton Supple. It is noted for its troubled and urgent development, with producer Ken Nelson having originally been tasked with producing much of the album; however, many songs written during his sessions were discarded owing to the band's dissatisfaction with them. The album's cover art {{is a combination of}} colours and blocks, which is a representation of the <b>Baudot</b> code.|$|E

25|$|The next {{improvement}} was the <b>Baudot</b> code of 1874. French engineer Émile <b>Baudot</b> patented a printing telegraph {{in which the}} signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a unique code based on the sequence of just five contacts. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.|$|E
25|$|A revolutionary new {{building}} material, reinforced concrete, {{appeared at the}} beginning of the 20th century and quietly began to change the face of Paris. The first church built in the new material was Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre, at 19 Rue des Abbesses at the foot of Montmartre. The architect was Anatole de <b>Baudot,</b> a student of Viollet-le-Duc. The nature of the revolution was not evident, because <b>Baudot</b> faced the concrete with brick and ceramic tiles in a colorful Art Nouveau style with stained glass windows in the same style.|$|E
25|$|Common carrier shifts are 85Hz (used on LF and VLF frequencies), 170Hz, 425Hz, 450Hz and 850Hz, {{although}} some stations use non-standard shifts.

40|$|Émile <b>Baudot’s</b> {{printing}} telegraph was {{the first}} widely adopted device to encode letters, numbers, and symbols as uniform-length binary sequences. Donald Murray introduced a second successful code of this type, the details of which continued to evolve until versions of <b>Baudot’s</b> and Murray’s codes were standardized as International Telegraph Alphabets No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. These codes were used for decades before the appearance of computers and the changing needs of communications required the design and standardization of a new code. Years of debate and compromise resulted in the ECMA- 6 standard in Europe, the ASCII standard in the United States, and the ISO 646 and International Alphabet No. 5 standards internationally.

25|$|Landline {{teleprinter}} operations {{began in}} 1849 when a circuit {{was put in}} service between Philadelphia and New York City.

500|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{theme in}} the album is that everything is broken, out of place or missing; This is apparent in nearly all songs in the album. Examples include [...] "Fix You" [...] ("When you lose something you can't replace") and also in [...] "X" [...] ("When something is broken, {{and you try to}} fix it, trying to repair it, any way you can") and [...] "Talk" [...] ("Are you lost or incomplete? Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?"). This theme is also reflective of the random, incomprehensible pattern on the album's cover (until you [...] "fix" [...] it using the <b>Baudot</b> Code).|$|E
500|$|The {{alphabet}} of {{the code}} {{is presented in the}} liner notes of X. The track listing, included on the booklet, CD, and back of the album, uses [...] "X#" [...] on tracks 1 to 6 and [...] "Y#" [...] on tracks 7 to 12, rather than the conventional track numbering system. This is a reference to the title of the album. Many pages in the booklet include photos of the band working on the album. The final page of the booklet contains the slogan [...] "Make Trade Fair" [...] in the <b>Baudot</b> code, a reference to the name of the international organization which Chris Martin continues to support. The band dedicates the album to [...] "BWP" [...] that is presented also inside the liner notes; it stands for Bruce W. Paltrow, the late father of Martin's wife at the time, Gwyneth Paltrow. All singles released from the album feature their titles in the same code on their respective covers. Martin sometimes wears coloured tape on his hands while on stage, as a reference to the album.|$|E

5000|$|During 1901 <b>Baudot's</b> {{code was}} {{modified}} by Donald Murray (1865-1945), prompted by his {{development of a}} typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate step, a keyboard perforator, which allowed an operator to punch a paper tape, and a tape transmitter for sending the message from the punched tape. At {{the receiving end of}} the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a reperforator could be used to make a perforated copy of the message. As there was no longer a direct correlation between the operator's hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue, and instead Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery, assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most frequently used characters. The Murray code also introduced what became known as [...] "format effectors" [...] or [...] "control characters" [...] - the CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed) codes. A few of <b>Baudot's</b> codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Baudot's</b> {{original}} {{code was}} adapted {{to be sent}} from a manual keyboard, and no teleprinter equipment was ever constructed that used it in its original form. The code was entered on a keyboard which had just five piano type keys, operated with two fingers of the left hand and three fingers of the right hand. Once the keys had been pressed they were locked down until mechanical contacts in a distributor unit passed over the sector connected to that particular keyboard, when the keyboard was unlocked {{ready for the next}} character to be entered, with an audible click (known as the [...] "cadence signal") to warn the operator. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.|$|R

2500|$|By 1935, {{message routing}} {{was the last}} great barrier to full automation. Large {{telegraphy}} providers began to develop systems that used telephone-like rotary dialling to connect teletypewriters. These machines were called [...] "Telex" [...] (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style pulse dialling for circuit switching and then sent data by <b>Baudot</b> code. This [...] "type A" [...] Telex routing functionally automated message routing.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{teleprinters}} {{used the}} ITA-1 <b>Baudot</b> code, a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, {{so it was}} over-defined into two [...] "shifts", [...] "letters", and [...] "figures". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901, Baudot's code was modified by Donald Murray and around 1930, the CCITT introduced the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) code as an international standard.|$|E

A few of <b>Baudot's</b> codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent, but the same code was used to encode the space separation between words. Sequences of DEL codes (fully punched columns) were used at start or end of messages or between them, allowing easy separation of distinct messages (BELL codes could be inserted in those sequences to signal to the remote operator that a new message was coming or that transmission of a message was terminated).|$|R
40|$|Multiplexing {{has evolved}} over the years from Emile <b>Baudot's</b> method of {{transmitting}} six simultaneous telegraph signals over one wire to the high-speed mixed-signal communications systems that are now commonplace. The evolution started with multiplexing identical information sources, such as {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS) devices. Recently, however, methods to combine signals from different information sources, such as telephone and video signals for example, have required new approaches to the development of software and hardware, and fundamental changes in the way we envision the basic block diagrams of communication systems. The importance of multiplexing cannot be overstated. To say that much of the current economic and technological progress worldwide {{is due in part to}} mixed-signal communications systems would not be incorrect. Along the vein of advancing the state-of-the-art, this dissertation research addresses a new area of multiplexing by taking a novel approach to network different-type sensors using software and signal processing. Two different sensor types were selected, fiber optics and MEMS, and were networked using code division multiplexing. The experimentation showed that the interconnection of these sensors using code division multiplexing was feasible and that the mixed signal demultiplexing software unique to this research allowed the disparate signals to be discerned. An analysis of an expanded system was performed with the results showing that the ultimate number of sensors that could be multiplexed with this technique ranges from the hundreds into the millions, depending on the specific design parameters used. Predictions about next-next generation systems using the techniques developed in the research are presented. iii Acknowledgments I [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} (or [...] "Baudot") radioteletype {{system is}} based almost invariably on the <b>Baudot</b> code or ITA-2 5 bit alphabet.
