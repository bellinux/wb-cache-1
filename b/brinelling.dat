50|$|The {{distinction}} between false <b>brinelling</b> and fretting corrosion {{has been extensively}} discussed in the literature. The main difference is that false <b>brinelling</b> occurs under lubricated and fretting under dry contact conditions. Between false <b>brinelling</b> and fretting corrosion also exists a time-dependend connection.|$|E

50|$|Bearings {{of modern}} wind {{turbines}} are often affected by false <b>brinelling.</b> Especially the pitch bearing, {{which is used}} under oscillation, shows often false <b>brinelling</b> damages.|$|E
50|$|False <b>brinelling</b> {{was first}} {{mentioned}} by Almen in 1937. Almen found that wheel bearings were damaged {{before they were}} used by customers. Furthermore, {{he found that the}} bearings were more damaged for long-distance shipping of the cars and that the season of shipping also had an influence. The reason for the damaged bearings were micro-oscillations which occurred due to the shipping. Because the damage has a similar look to <b>brinelling,</b> it was called false <b>brinelling.</b>|$|E
50|$|A similar-looking kind {{of damage}} is called false <b>brinelling</b> and {{is caused by}} {{fretting}} wear. This occurs when contacting bodies vibrate {{against each other in}} the presence of very small loads, which pushes lubricant out of the contact surface area, and the bearing assembly cannot move far enough to redistribute the displaced lubricant. The result is a finely polished surface that resembles a brinell mark, but has not permanently deformed either contacting surface. This type of false <b>brinelling</b> usually occurs in bearings during transportation, between the time of manufacture and installation. The polished surfaces are often mistaken for <b>brinelling,</b> although no actual damage to the bearing exists. The false <b>brinelling</b> will disappear after a short break-in period of operation.|$|E

50|$|Also if {{a bearing}} is not rotating, {{oscillating}} {{forces on the}} bearing can cause impact damage to the bearing race or the rolling elements, known as <b>brinelling.</b> A second lesser form called false <b>brinelling</b> occurs if the bearing only rotates across a short arc and pushes lubricant out away from the rolling elements.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Brinelling</b> is a {{material}} surface failure caused by Hertz contact stress that exceeds the material limit. It usually occurs {{in situations where}} a significant load force is distributed over a relatively small surface area. <b>Brinelling</b> typically results from a heavy or repeated impact load, either while stopped or during rotation, though {{it can also be}} caused by just one application of a force greater than the material limit.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brinelling</b> [...] is the {{permanent}} indentation {{of a hard}} surface. It is named after the Brinell scale of hardness, in which a small ball is pushed against a hard surface at a preset level of force, and the depth and diameter of the mark indicates the Brinell hardness of the surface. <b>Brinelling</b> {{is a process of}} wear in which similar marks are pressed into the surface of a moving part, such as bearings or hydraulic pistons. The <b>brinelling</b> is usually undesirable, as the parts often mate with other parts in very close proximity. The very small indentations can quickly lead to improper operation, like chattering or excess vibration, which in turn can accelerate other forms of wear, such as spalling and galling.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brinelling</b> {{may occur}} with poor quality washers, {{leading to a}} loss of clamp load and {{subsequent}} failure of the joint.|$|E
5000|$|Rotor overspeed, {{which can}} over-stress the rotor hub pitch {{bearings}} (<b>brinelling)</b> and, if severe enough, cause blade {{separation from the}} aircraft.|$|E
50|$|A {{common cause}} of <b>brinelling</b> {{is the use of}} {{improper}} installation procedures. <b>Brinelling</b> often occurs when pressing bearings into holes or onto shafts. Care must usually be taken to ensure that pressure is applied to the proper bearing race to avoid transferring the pressure from one race to the other through the balls or rollers. If pressing force is applied to the wrong race, <b>brinelling</b> can occur to either or both of the races. The act of pressing or clamping can also leave brinell marks, especially if the vise or press has serrated jaws or roughened surfaces. Flat pressing plates are often used in the pressing of bearings, while soft copper, brass, or aluminum jaw covers are often used in vises to help avoid brinell marks from being forced into the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|Engineers {{can use the}} Brinell {{hardness}} {{of materials}} in their calculations to avoid this mode of failure. A rolling element bearing's static load rating is defined to avoid this failure type. Increasing the number of elements can provide better distribution of the load, so bearings intended for a large load may have many balls, or use needles instead. This decreases the chances of <b>brinelling,</b> but increases friction and other factors. However, although roller and ball bearings work well for radial and thrust loading, they are often prone to <b>brinelling</b> when very high impact loading, lateral loading, or vibration are experienced. Babbitt bearings or bronze bushings are often used instead of roller bearings in applications where such loads exist, such as in automotive crankshafts or pulley sheaves, to decrease the possibility of <b>brinelling</b> by distributing the force over a very large surface area.|$|E
50|$|Washers {{are usually}} metal or plastic. High-quality bolted joints require {{hardened}} steel washers {{to prevent the}} loss of pre-load due to <b>Brinelling</b> after the torque is applied.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{spalling}} {{occurs at}} high stress contact points, for example, {{in a ball}} bearing. Spalling occurs in preference to <b>brinelling</b> where the maximal shear stress occurs not at the surface, but just below, shearing the spall off.|$|E
50|$|Brinell {{is noted}} as {{the creator of}} a method for {{quantifying}} the surface hardness of materials, {{now known as the}} Brinell hardness test. His name is also commemorated in the description of a failure mechanism of material surfaces known as <b>Brinelling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brinelling</b> can {{be caused}} by a heavy load resting on a {{stationary}} bearing for an extended length of time. The result is a permanent dent or [...] "brinell mark". The brinell marks will often appear in evenly spaced patterns along the bearing races, resembling the primary elements of the bearing, such as rows of indented lines for needle or roller bearings or rounded indentations in ball bearings. It is a common cause of roller bearing failures, and loss of preload in bolted joints when a hardened washer is not used. For example, <b>brinelling</b> occurs in casters when the ball bearings within the swivel head produce grooves in the hard cap, thus degrading performance by increasing the required swivel force.|$|E
50|$|Fretting wear {{can also}} occur during operation, causing deeper indentations. This occurs when small {{vibrations}} {{form in the}} rotating shaft and become harmonically {{in sync with the}} speed of rotation, causing circular oscillations in the shaft. The oscillation causes the shaft to move in precession, and the timing of the rotation speed causes the balls or rollers to contact the races only when they are in similar positions. This forms wear marks caused by contact with the bearings and the races in specific areas, but not in others, leaving an uneven wear-pattern that resembles <b>brinelling.</b> However, the marks are usually too wide and do not exactly match the shape of the bearing, and therefore this type of wear can be differentiated from true <b>brinelling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{load and}} {{operating}} situation of pitch bearings are for rolling element bearings comparatively unfavorable. The bearings {{are exposed to}} high loads and small reciprocating movements created by the pitch system or vibrations from the wind profile. The small reciprocating movements between rolling elements and raceway can lead to wear phenomena like false <b>brinelling</b> and fretting corrosion. Furthermore, the high loads can lead to truncation of the contact ellipse. Due to the small reciprocating movements calculation methods to estimate the bearing service life [...] and the friction torque are not useable for pitch bearings. Newer controlling concepts of pitch control, like individual pitch control, will lead to smaller and more frequent oscillation amplitudes which could favor false <b>brinelling</b> and fretting corrosion.|$|E
5000|$|Until recently, bicycle {{headsets}} {{tended to}} suffer from false <b>brinelling</b> in the [...] "straight ahead" [...] steering position, due to small movements caused by flexing of the fork. Good modern headsets incorporate a plain bearing to accommodate this flexing, leaving the ball race to provide pure rotational movement.|$|E
5000|$|On {{bicycles}} ridden only in dry conditions and/or with fenders, {{the normal}} failure mode is a progressive notchiness in the steering, described as [...] "indexing" [...] in the bicycle world, caused by pitting {{of the races}} or false <b>brinelling,</b> although the term stems from a misunderstanding of the cause; true <b>brinelling</b> is caused merely by pressing the ball axially into the race, and {{it is almost impossible}} to replicate this damage even by striking the fork crown repeatedly with a hammer. The pits are by far deepest at the front and back of the head tube, and are actually caused by flexing of the fork blades, which is transmitted to the steerer tube. This misaligns the bearings and causes fretting, a small amplitude, large stress movement which tears metal from the races at the points where the balls rest.|$|E
50|$|The Frey {{mechanism}} uses a {{steel ball}} and an out-of-flat {{end for the}} intermediate pin to force the intermediate pin to cock at reset. This means the intermediate spring doesn't need a special end, but the high stresses at the contact with the steel ball can lead to <b>brinelling</b> of the intermediate pin end or {{the top of the}} punch by the ball.|$|E
50|$|Doyoyo's honors thesis was on {{the design}} and {{construction}} of mechanical equipment to investigate false <b>brinelling</b> of heavy-duty bearings in electric motors. Having completed his requirements of a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering before graduation, he was admitted by Brown University as a visiting undergraduate student, taking graduate courses in solid mechanics, materials science, and applied mathematics. He earned masters' degrees in solid mechanics and applied mathematics in 1995 and 1996, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{solution}} {{is to have a}} 45 degree interface in the headset where this flexing movement can be accommodated, preserving the relative alignment of the races and allowing the ball bearings to take pure axial and rotational loads. Shimano cartridge bearing headsets do this by allowing the cartridges to move relative to the pressed-in cups, while Stronglight roller bearing headsets, and most threadless headsets, now have loose upper and lower races which can move relative to the cups. Modern headsets, therefore, rarely suffer from false <b>brinelling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rolling-element {{bearings}} {{often work}} well in non-ideal conditions, but sometimes minor problems cause bearings to fail quickly and mysteriously. For example, with a stationary (non-rotating) load, small vibrations can gradually press out the lubricant between the races and rollers or balls (false <b>brinelling).</b> Without lubricant the bearing fails, {{even though it is}} not rotating and thus is apparently not being used. For these sorts of reasons, much of bearing design is about failure analysis. Vibration based analysis can be used for fault identification of bearings.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{cause of}} false <b>brinelling</b> {{is that the}} design of the bearing does not have a method for {{redistribution}} of lubricant without large rotational movement of all bearing surfaces in the raceway. Lubricant is pushed out of a loaded region during small oscillatory movements and vibration where the bearings surfaces repeatedly do not move very far. Without lubricant, wear is increased when the small oscillatory movements occur again. It is possible for the resulting wear debris to oxidize and form an abrasive compound which further accelerates wear.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there are}} many other {{apparent}} causes of bearing failure, most can be reduced to these three. For example, a bearing which is run dry of lubricant fails not because it is [...] "without lubricant", but because lack of lubrication leads to fatigue and welding, and the resulting wear debris can cause abrasion. Similar events occur in false <b>brinelling</b> damage. In high speed applications, the oil flow also reduces the bearing metal temperature by convection. The oil becomes the heat sink for the friction losses generated by the bearing.|$|E
5000|$|Rolling element {{bearing life}} is {{determined}} by load, temperature, maintenance, lubrication, material defects, contamination, handling, installation and other factors. These factors can all {{have a significant effect}} on bearing life. For example, the service life of bearings in one application was extended dramatically by changing how the bearings were stored before installation and use, as vibrations during storage caused lubricant failure even when the only load on the bearing was its own weight; [...] the resulting damage is often false <b>brinelling.</b> [...] Bearing life is statistical: several samples of a given bearing will often exhibit a bell curve of service life, with a few samples showing significantly better or worse life. Bearing life varies because microscopic structure and contamination vary greatly even where macroscopically they seem identical.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) occurs due to {{the result}} of cyclic stress developed during operation and mechanism that involve in fretting failure of rolling element bearing. As bearing raceways of non-rotating rolling element bearings exposed to vibration or sliding oscillation false <b>Brinelling</b> occurs. Bearing surface due to false <b>Brinelling</b> tends to damage within a short period, due to cavities created on the bearing raceway. Recommendation towards enhancement of bearing life is also suggested...|$|E
