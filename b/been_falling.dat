Rain had <b>been</b> <b>falling</b> for several hours, turning the field into a muddy mess that would hinder play throughout the game. 62,850 tickets were sold for the game, and that number was given as the official attendance. Real attendance estimates range from 40,000-50,000, due to the poor weather {{and the fact that}} the stadium was half-empty through much of the game.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, {{the upper}} Caroline Street {{corridor}} and Key West Bight {{have been part}} of ongoing improvement efforts spearheaded by the City of Key West and funded by a special property tax system. At the beginning of the project, the area, once dominated by commercial fishing, had <b>been</b> <b>falling</b> into disarray as its practical future became uncertain. The dynamics of the project changed throughout its course; in early 2011, the city approved spending for specific updates to infrastructure along the corridor, including improved lighting and signs, a more extensive sidewalk system, and versatility with regard to bicycle and pedestrian traffic. As recently as February 2012, additional requests for improvements were lodged with $720,000 available for the project.|$|E

5|$|While {{wandering}} in the woods, Finn and Jake fall down two separate holes. Finn {{lands in the}} Kingdom of Huge, where he is greeted by its sovereign, King Huge. The king lavishes Finn with food and asks that he stay and watch the chiming of his cuckoo clock. However, it soon becomes apparent that King Huge is insane; he demands that Finn remain and watch every time the clock chimes the hour. Meanwhile, Jake lands on the barge of a bear named Seven. According to Seven, the barge has <b>been</b> <b>falling</b> for years, and he warns Jake not to try and escape, lest he die.|$|E
5|$|Cortés {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} Aj Kan Ek', {{the king of the}} Itza, to visit Nojpetén (also known as Tayasal), and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore. On his departure from Nojpetén, Cortés left behind a cross and a lame horse. The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of Franciscan priests in 1618, when Cortés' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpetén. From the lake, Cortés continued south along the western slopes of the Maya Mountains, a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover , during which he lost more than two-thirds of his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had <b>been</b> <b>falling</b> during the expedition, Cortés turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.|$|E
5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by the other. A new plan was made to attack Ascalon and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, {{due to the lack}} of trust that had {{resulted}} from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had <b>been</b> <b>falling</b> apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.|$|E

5|$|On Bermuda, the {{hurricane}} brought sustained winds estimated between , with higher gusts. A minimum pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.30inHg) was recorded, though a lower pressure {{may have occurred}} on the island as the barometer had <b>been</b> <b>falling</b> at the time. The strong winds downed power lines and felled trees, littering insular streets with debris. As a result, power outages occurred and loss of telecommunications was reported. Radio stations based on the island went silent due to the power loss. An emergency backup power generator at King Edward Memorial Hospital was used to restore electrical power to the facility. However, oil lamps were still used in place of any form of electrical lighting. Several slate roofs were torn from their buildings from the strong winds. Heavy rainfall associated with {{the hurricane}} flooded long stretches of roadway. Some roads were blocked and rendered impassable by the rainfall. At the local harbor, six vessels were inundated by the strong offshore wave action. Overall, property damage on the island was estimated at $400,000.|$|E
5|$|That night, a {{force of}} around 300 Japanese who had <b>been</b> <b>falling</b> back since they had run into the 61st Infantry Battalion on Stephen's Ridge, {{encountered}} positions manned by the 2/12th and 9th Infantry Battalions around the Gama River. In a surprise attack, the Australians inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese. After the battle the Australians estimated that up to 90 had been killed. Following this the Japanese began to employ infiltration techniques {{in an attempt to}} pass through the numerous listening posts that had been set up {{along the side of the}} track which formed the front of one side of the 2/12th's position. Elsewhere, at the mission, starting at around 8:00pm, they carried out harassment operations in an effort to distract the Australians and assist their comrades to try to break through the Australian positions from the Gama River. This lasted throughout the night.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake stumble into two {{different}} holes and meet two different fates: Finn becomes the guest of the unstable King Huge (voiced by Jones), who insists that Finn remain with him and stare at his idiosyncratic cuckoo clock; whereas Jake meets Seven (voiced by Isaak), a bear whose makeshift air raft has <b>been</b> <b>falling</b> down the hole for years. Eventually, {{it turns out that}} the hole Jake and Seven are falling through is the chimney to the kitchen where Finn is being held captive. As such, Jake is eventually able to save Finn.|$|E

5|$|The {{survival}} {{of this species}} is tied closely to rainfall because of the susceptibility of seedlings to drought. It is thus especially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} climate change. This was recognised as early as 1992, when it was noted that winter rainfall in the Quairading region had <b>been</b> <b>falling</b> by about 4% per decade, and that a continuation of this trend may reduce the species' distribution. Recently, a more thorough assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to extinction, and mild change to a reduction of its range by 80% by 2080. However, there may not be any range reduction at all under mid-severity climate change, depending on how effectively this species can migrate into newly habitable areas.|$|E
