5|$|The {{authorities}} had initially {{planned for the}} replica to replace the red Berlayer <b>Beacon,</b> but the Singapore Heritage Society was against the decision, saying the <b>beacon</b> was itself a heritage site {{and should not be}} destroyed because the <b>beacon</b> has been at Labrador Park since the end of World War II. The replica was finally built just meters away from the <b>beacon.</b> The authorities hope the symbolic replica can serve to preserve the memory of Long Ya Men, which {{is an important part of}} Singapore's maritime history, for future generations and visitors familiar with the historical voyages of Zheng He.|$|E

Lighted <b>beacons</b> are called lights; unlighted <b>beacons</b> are called daybeacons.|$|R
50|$|Since 1 February 2009, only 406 MHz <b>beacons</b> are {{detected}} {{by the international}} Cospas-Sarsat SAR satellite system.

5|$|<b>Beacon</b> Hill Station {{opened to}} the public on July 18, 2009 during a weekend of free service celebrating the inaugural day of Central Link service. The line's opening was delayed from its {{projected}} July 3 date due in part to slowdowns in <b>Beacon</b> Hill construction. The year after the line opened, nine air pockets above the tunnel, caused by soil slides above the tunnel boring machine, were discovered and filled with cement to prevent sinkholes. Service to the southbound platforms at <b>Beacon</b> Hill and Mount Baker were suspended for a daylong emergency drill in November 2010, briefly restricting service to the northbound platform while maintaining a 10-minute headway. During a winter storm in January 2012, an overnight train running to keep the overhead catenary free of ice stalled inside the <b>Beacon</b> Hill Tunnel, allowing for ice build up that canceled Link service for several hours. In late 2013, <b>Beacon</b> Hill Station was closed for two hours after the discovery of smoke in the tunnel, station, and nearby Mount Baker Station, coming from a homeless encampment {{on the west side of}} <b>Beacon</b> Hill. The incident prompted Sound Transit to hold meetings with the Seattle Fire Department on preventing a total system shut-down in the event of an electrical fire.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beacon</b> Hill Station {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1998 and was opened on July 18, 2009, {{as part of}} the inaugural Link line, after five years of tunnel boring and station construction. It consists of a single island platform, divided into two sections by the twin bores of the <b>Beacon</b> Hill Tunnel; four high-speed elevators ferry passengers from the platform to the surface entrance. Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. <b>Beacon</b> Hill Station is also served by two King County Metro buses that stop at a pair of sheltered bus stops on <b>Beacon</b> Avenue.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beacon</b> Hill {{station is}} also served by three bus routes {{operated}} by King County Metro that use bus stops {{adjacent to the}} station: Route 36, an electric trolleybus route, runs along <b>Beacon</b> Avenue from Othello station to the International District and Downtown; Route 60 runs between West Seattle, Georgetown, <b>Beacon</b> Hill, First Hill and Capitol Hill; and Route 107, which terminates at the station and travels southeasterly to Georgetown, Rainier Beach station, Skyway and Renton.|$|E
40|$|Vehicular {{communication}} requires {{vehicles to}} self-organize through {{the exchange of}} periodic <b>beacons.</b> Recent analysis on <b>beaconing</b> indicates that the standards for <b>beaconing</b> restrict the desired performance of vehicular applications. This situation {{can be attributed to}} the quality of the available transmission medium, persistent change in the traffic situation and the inability of standards to cope with application requirements. To this end, this paper is motivated by the classifications and capability evaluations of existing adaptive <b>beaconing</b> approaches. To begin with, we explore the anatomy and the performance requirements of <b>beaconing.</b> Then, the <b>beaconing</b> design is analyzed to introduce a design-based <b>beaconing</b> taxonomy. A survey of the state-of-the-art is conducted with an emphasis on the salient features of the <b>beaconing</b> approaches. We also evaluate the capabilities of <b>beaconing</b> approaches using several key parameters. A comparison among <b>beaconing</b> approaches is presented, which is based on the architectural and implementation characteristics. The paper concludes by discussing open challenges in the field...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to identifying propagation, microwave <b>beacons</b> {{are also used}} as signal sources to test and calibrate antennas and receivers.

40|$|The ad hoc {{wireless}} devices may relay completely or partially on batteries. The {{technology for}} battery lifetime improvement is slower then the processor speed and memory capacity. Therefore power conservation {{becomes one of}} the design requirements for ad hoc wireless network protocols. Several protocols use <b>beaconing</b> messages for route updating. An experiment implementing Associativity Based Routing ABR protocol analyses the effect of <b>beaconing</b> interval on battery lifetime. Also the time for power down is observed in diverse configurations: beaconig standalone and <b>beaconing</b> with neighbors. The experiment demonstrates that high frequency <b>beaconing</b> consumes more battery lifetime then low frequency <b>beaconing.</b> The power consumption {{in the presence of}} the neighbor mobile hosts as a result of receiving <b>beacons</b> does not contribute much to the overall power degradation when the <b>beaconing</b> interval is small. That is because the receiving <b>beacons</b> consume less then to transmit <b>beacons...</b>|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, 100,000 {{copies of}} The <b>Beacon</b> Street Collection had been sold, over three times as many as their first album, No Doubt. These sales were mostly due to the release of Tragic Kingdom, which was {{released}} seven months after The <b>Beacon</b> Street Collection in October 1995. Tragic Kingdom was a massive commercial success, reaching sales of over 10 million in the United States and 16 million worldwide, peaking at number one on several charts and being certified Diamond (10,000,000 units) in the US and Canada and Platinum in the UK and Australia. This success created an extensive interest in the band's back catalog so, in October 1997, The <b>Beacon</b> Street Collection was re-released on Interscope.|$|E

5|$|The game's ending changes {{depending}} on whether the player has a radio <b>beacon</b> to call for extraction, and when the nuclear device is set to explode. Forgetting to set the bomb, or setting it to explode at any time past the awakening of the dreaming god, results in Earth's destruction. The device's detonation before the player reaches a minimum safe distance results in a pyrrhic victory. The most favorable endings are achieved by leaving the pyramid with a <b>beacon</b> for evacuation at least twenty game minutes before the device is set to go off; if the game ends with enough time for the player to escape on foot, the player survives without a <b>beacon.</b>|$|E

50|$|Distress radiobeacons, also collectively {{known as}} {{distress}} <b>beacons,</b> emergency <b>beacons,</b> or simply, <b>beacons,</b> are those tracking transmitters that operate {{as part of}} the international Cospas-Sarsat Search and Rescue satellite system. When activated, these <b>beacons</b> send out a distress signal that, when detected by non-geostationary satellites, can be located by triangulation. In the case of 406 MHz <b>beacons</b> which transmit digital signals, the <b>beacons</b> can be uniquely identified almost instantly (via GEOSAR), and furthermore, a GPS position can be encoded into the signal (thus providing both instantaneous identification & position.) Distress signals from the <b>beacons</b> are homed by Search and Rescue (SAR) aircraft and ground search parties who can in turn {{come to the aid of}} the concerned boat, aircraft, and/or persons.|$|R

5|$|<b>Beacon</b> Hill {{station is}} part of Sound Transit's Central Link line, which runs from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport through the Rainier Valley and Downtown Seattle to the University of Washington. It is the eighth {{northbound}} station from Angle Lake station and ninth southbound station from University of Washington station, and is situated between Mount Baker and SODO stations. Central Link trains serve <b>Beacon</b> Hill 20 hours a day on weekdays and Saturdays, from 5:00am to 1:00am, and 18 hours on Sundays, from 6:00am to 12:00am; during regular weekday service, trains operate roughly every 6 to 10 minutes during rush hour and midday operation, with longer headways of 15 minutes {{in the early morning}} and 20 minutes at night. During weekends, Central Link trains arrive at <b>Beacon</b> Hill Station every 10 minutes during midday hours and every 15 minutes during mornings and evenings. The station is approximately 24 minutes from SeaTac/Airport station and 15 minutes from Westlake station in Downtown Seattle.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beacon</b> Park {{stands on}} land which was {{originally}} low lying, poorly drained pasture alongside the Leamonsley Brook.

The waterlogged marshland surrounding Bishops Fish Pool became known as 'The Moggs' from the 15th century and later 'Swan Moggs'.|$|E
5|$|Between 1631 and 1890, {{the city}} tripled its area through land {{reclamation}} by filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between wharves along the waterfront.

30|$|In {{vehicular}} {{cyber-physical system}} (VCPS), <b>beaconing</b> mechanism is commonly deployed for the solar-powered roadside infrastructure to detect available passing-by vehicles for data dissemination. The traditional <b>beaconing</b> mechanism {{would cause a}} higher energy consumption due to the periodical <b>beaconing</b> procedure. To tackle this problem, we propose a new data dissemination strategy for roadside infrastructures by adjusting the <b>beaconing</b> interval to reduce the energy consumption. We model the <b>beaconing</b> procedure as a Markov model by observing the periodical <b>beaconing</b> results and then using the modeling result to obtain {{the relationship between the}} <b>beaconing</b> interval and the expectation of the single-vehicle discovery time. Then, with the average data transmission rate requirement, we can calculate the maximum <b>beaconing</b> interval. We also introduce a satisfaction degree based on the Sigmoid function to combine the decreased energy consumption and the decreased data rate. The satisfaction degree function allows the roadside infrastructure to obtain the optimal <b>beaconing</b> interval based on the required quality of service. The analysis of the results show that careful tuning of key parameters leads to improved energy efficiency and increased data rate of the data dissemination strategy.|$|R
