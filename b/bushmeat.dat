5|$|Livestock {{are raised}} {{throughout}} the country. Fishing employs 5,000 people and provides over 100,000 tons of seafood each year. <b>Bushmeat,</b> long a staple food for rural Cameroonians, is today a delicacy in the country's urban centres. The commercial <b>bushmeat</b> trade has now surpassed deforestation {{as the main}} threat to wildlife in Cameroon.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that humans who participate in <b>bushmeat</b> activities, either as hunters or as <b>bushmeat</b> vendors, commonly acquire SIV. However, SIV is a weak virus, and it is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into HIV. Furthermore, due to its relatively low person-to-person transmission rate, it can only spread throughout {{the population in the}} presence of one or more high-risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa prior to the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans may {{be killed}} for the <b>bushmeat</b> trade, crop protection, or for use for {{traditional}} medicine. Orangutan bones are secretly traded in souvenir shops in several cities in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Mother orangutans are killed so their infants {{can be sold}} as pets, {{and many of these}} infants die without the help of their mother. Since 2004, several pet orangutans were confiscated by local authorities and sent to rehabilitation centres.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are {{threatened}} by deforestation and the wildlife trade, which includes the exotic pet trade, traditional medicine, and <b>bushmeat.</b> Other threats includes road construction, selective logging, and slash and burn agriculture. Habitat fragmentation obstructs biological dispersal for these species that rely on vines and lianas to move from tree to tree. Consequently, slow lorises are found dead on power lines or are victims of roadkill in areas where roads cut between forest patches.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{assessed}} both Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} {{and the northern}} giant mouse lemur as endangered. Prior to that, both species had been listed as vulnerable. Populations of both species are in decline due to habitat destruction, primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production. Also, they are both hunted for <b>bushmeat.</b> The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF. Its forests {{were not included in}} the protected area due to existing concessions for mining activities.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} {{non-human}} primates, strepsirrhines face an elevated risk of extinction due to human activity, particularly deforestation in tropical regions. Much of their habitat {{has been converted}} for human use, such as agriculture and pasture. The threats facing strepsirrhine primates fall into three main categories: habitat destruction, hunting (for <b>bushmeat</b> or traditional medicine), and live capture for export or local exotic pet trade. Although hunting is often prohibited, the laws protecting them are rarely enforced. In Madagascar, local taboos known as fady sometimes help protect lemur species, although some are still hunted for traditional medicine.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{antelope}} prefers {{areas with}} fresh and dense growth of shrubs and other plants. It inhabits the warm, moist lowland forests prevalent in western African {{countries such as}} Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The royal antelope has been categorised as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The populations are feared to be declining due to habitat deterioration and expanding human settlement. A significant threat {{to the survival of}} this antelope is hunting for <b>bushmeat.</b>|$|E
5|$|The royal {{antelope}} {{has been}} categorised as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated {{the total population}} to be about 62,000, however {{this is likely to}} be an underestimate. The populations are feared to be declining due to habitat deterioration and expanding human settlement. A significant threat to the survival of this antelope is hunting for bushmeat; it is seldom hunted in Sierra Leone and Liberia, whereas it is a major source of <b>bushmeat</b> in Côte d'Ivoire. Protected areas where the royal antelope occurs include the Tai National Park, Haut Bandama Fauna and Flora Reserve and Mabi-Yaya Classified Forest (Côte d'Ivoire); Kakum National Park and Assin-Attandanso Game Production Reserve (Ghana); Ziama and Diecke Forest Reserves (Guinea); Tiwai Island and Gola Rainforest National Park (Sierra Leone).|$|E
5|$|The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the okapi as Endangered. It {{is fully}} {{protected}} under Congolese law. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve and Maiko National Park support significant {{populations of the}} okapi, though {{there has been a}} steady decline in numbers due to several threats. Other areas of occurrence are the Rubi Tele Hunting Reserve and the Abumombanzi Reserve. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Extensive hunting for <b>bushmeat</b> and skin and illegal mining have also led to population declines. A threat that has emerged quite recently is the presence of illegal armed groups around protected areas, inhibiting conservation and monitoring actions. A small population occurs north of the Virunga National Park, but is bereft of protection due to the presence of armed groups in the vicinity. In June 2012, a gang of poachers attacked the headquarters of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, killing six guards and other staff as well as all 14 okapis at their breeding center.|$|E
25|$|In late 2014, {{the fear}} of {{contracting}} the Ebola virus disease from <b>bushmeat</b> led {{at least one major}} Nigerian newspaper to imply that eating dog meat was a healthy alternative. That paper documented a thriving trade in dog meat and slow sales of even well smoked <b>bushmeat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Endangered {{species are}} hunted for human {{consumption}} as <b>bushmeat</b> in Liberia. Species hunted for food in Liberia include elephants, pygmy hippopotamus, chimpanzees, leopards, duikers, and other monkeys. <b>Bushmeat</b> is often exported to neighboring Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast, despite {{a ban on the}} cross-border sale of wild animals.|$|E
25|$|Road {{construction}} from {{logging and}} mining operations decreases the distance hunters {{have to walk}} to reach a given section of the forest to hunt, making what was previously a multi-day trip possible to complete within a day. Additionally {{it has been shown}} that as logging increases, wages and demand for <b>bushmeat</b> increases as well; this leads to the increased export of <b>bushmeat</b> from the forest.|$|E
25|$|In {{the northeastern}} {{part of the}} Republic of the Congo, even though {{poaching}} is illegal, western lowland gorillas are still being hunted for their <b>bushmeat</b> and the young for pets; {{five percent of the}} species is killed each year because of this. Deforestation of this area allows for the trade of <b>bushmeat</b> and even more poaching. Commercial poaching of chimpanzees, forest elephants and western gorillas in The Republic of the Congo resulted from the increased amount of commercial logging and infrastructure. Deforestation and logging allowed for the creation of roads which allowed hunters to hunt deeper into the forests, increasing the amount of poaching and <b>bushmeat</b> trade in the area. The Republic of the Congo has put in place a conservation effort to conserve different species such as chimpanzees, forest elephants and western gorillas from poaching and deforestation. This conservation effort would allow these species to benefit from vegetation and ecologically important resources.|$|E
25|$|Even {{elephants}} {{which are}} known for being hunted for ivory are considered targets for <b>bushmeat</b> trade as a single elephant can provide thousands of kilos of meat which can be easier to sell than its ivory. From 2002 to 2013, the DRC elephant population decreased dramatically from roughly 62,000 to 5,000. In the DRC, with the wide expanses of forest, high income {{can be obtained from}} the meat trade; consequently, almost no sort of wildlife protection enforcement can prevent the consumption and trade of <b>bushmeat,</b> which continues to rise.|$|E
25|$|Meat {{often comes}} from hunting. Conservation groups are {{concerned}} that, {{with the rise}} in the human population, many animal species are in danger of extinction because of the trade in <b>bushmeat.</b> Chimpanzee, bonobo, wild boar, monkey, antelope, and other wild animals are often sold in the market or at impromptu stalls around the town. In 1998, Jeff Dupain and others catalogued the types of <b>bushmeat</b> available in the two main Basankusu markets; they interviewed the stallholders to find out where the animals were hunted. Many people keep livestock around the family home. Chickens, pigs, and, less frequently, sheep and goats provide fresh food and a source of income.|$|E
25|$|As the {{mammalian}} and avian game {{populations are}} gradually depleted in the Congo Basin, {{the proportion of}} large-bodied snakes offered at rural <b>bushmeat</b> markets increases. Consequently, {{a large proportion of}} the human population faces the threat of Armillifer armillatus infections, a python-borne zoonotic disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{per capita}} income of the Republic is often listed as being {{approximately}} $400 a year, {{one of the lowest}} in the world, but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of exports and largely ignores the unregistered sale of foods, locally produced alcoholic beverages, diamonds, ivory, <b>bushmeat,</b> and traditional medicine.|$|E
25|$|One {{threat to}} the large flying fox is habitat destruction. Flying foxes are {{sometimes}} hunted for food, and the controls on hunting seem to be unenforceable. In some areas, farmers consider them pests as they sometimes feed on their orchards. This species is also hunted for <b>bushmeat</b> in Indonesia, contributing to its decline.|$|E
25|$|Transmission is {{believed}} to be by contact with the blood and body fluids of those infected with the virus, as well as by handling raw <b>bushmeat</b> such as bats and monkeys, which are important sources of protein in West Africa. Infectious body fluids include blood, sweat, semen, breast milk, saliva, tears, feces, urine, vaginal secretions, vomit, and diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|The eastern {{mountain}} gorilla's {{population has}} diminished as well. Miners {{are far from}} food sources and have been hunting gorillas. The gorilla population has been seriously reduced and is now critically endangered. In Central and West Africa an estimated 3–5 million tons of <b>bushmeat</b> is obtained by killing wild animals (including gorillas) each year.|$|E
25|$|In these areas, {{hunting and}} {{poaching}} of wild <b>bushmeat</b> has declined dramatically. The approach holds promise {{for the area}} surrounding the park. Other ways to protect the endangered species include creating corridors or eco-ducts, highway diversion and improved policing. All would be expensive and depend on committed government officials {{at the state and}} federal levels.|$|E
25|$|Cyclones have precipitated illegal {{rosewood}} {{logging in}} other ways. When Cyclone Hudah hit {{the island in}} April 2000, affecting 50,000 people, it exacerbated local poverty. Its devastating effects, later coupled with the downturn in the vanilla market, drove the local people to increase their slash and burn agriculture (called tavy), the use of <b>bushmeat,</b> and the logging of precious hardwoods.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bushmeat,</b> an {{important}} source of protein in the diet of some Africans, should be handled and prepared with appropriate protective clothing and thoroughly cooked before consumption. Some research suggests that an outbreak of Ebola disease in the wild animals used for consumption may result in a corresponding human outbreak. Since 2003, such animal outbreaks have been monitored to predict and prevent Ebola outbreaks in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bushmeat</b> {{has also}} been implicated in {{spreading}} Ebola disease, either by handling the raw meat or through droppings from the animals. It is the raw blood and meat that {{is thought to be}} more dangerous, so it is those that hunt and butcher the raw meat that are more at risk as opposed to cooked meat sold at market. Health care workers in Sierra Leone have been warned not to go to markets.|$|E
25|$|Human-to-human {{transmission}} of EBOV {{through the air}} has not been reported to occur during EVD outbreaks, and airborne transmission has only been demonstrated in very strict laboratory conditions, and then only from pigs to primates, but not from primates to primates. Spread of EBOV by water, or food other than <b>bushmeat,</b> has not been observed. No spread by mosquitos or other insects has been reported. Other possible methods of transmission are being studied.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{supports}} many conservation projects including Okapi Conservation - Epulu Research Station, Zaire, International Rhino Foundation, Chimp Haven, <b>Bushmeat</b> Crisis Task Force, Gray's Monitor Lizard In The Philippines, Taxon Advisory Groups (Tag), Bowling For Rhinos, and the Thailand Hornbill Project - Adopt A Hornbill Nest. In {{addition to}} conservation, sustainability {{efforts by the}} zoo include growing bamboo and cabbage to function {{as part of the}} landscape aesthetic throughout the zoo. The overgrowth is harvested and used as food for the zoo's herbivores.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 it was {{discovered}} that samples of suspected Lassa fever showed evidence of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus in Sierra Leone as early as 2006. Prior to the current Zaire strain outbreak in 2014, Ebola had not really been seen in Sierra Leone, or even in West Africa among humans. It is suspected that fruit bats are natural carriers of disease, native to this region of Africa including Sierra Leone and also a popular food source for both humans and wildlife. The Gola forests in south-east Sierra Leone are a noted source of <b>bushmeat.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{tropical}} forests, gorillas are hunted {{to provide}} meat for the <b>bushmeat</b> trade. Logging also destroys gorilla habitats. Although logging diminishes gorilla habitats, {{it may also}} provide for increased herbaceous vegetation {{as a result of}} gaps in the tree cover. Destruction of gorilla habitat may harm the overall forest ecosystem. Western lowland gorillas are seed dispersers, which mean they carry seeds from one place to another, and this trait is beneficial to many of the animals in the forest. Therefore, if there are no western lowland gorillas to disperse the needed seeds to other animals, not only will the gorillas become extinct but so will many other animals, which could over time destroy an entire ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|As the bonobos' {{habitat is}} shared with people, the {{ultimate}} success of conservation efforts still rely on local and community involvement. The issue of parks versus people is salient in the Cuvette Centrale the bonobos' range. There is strong local and broad-based Congolese resistance to establishing national parks, as indigenous communities {{have often been}} driven from their forest homes by the establishment of parks. In Salonga National Park, the only national park in the bonobo habitat, there is no local involvement, and surveys undertaken since 2000 indicate the bonobo, the African forest elephant, and other species have been severely devastated by poachers and the thriving <b>bushmeat</b> trade. In contrast, areas exist where the bonobo and biodiversity still thrive without any established parks, due to the indigenous beliefs and taboos against killing bonobos.|$|E
25|$|Disease {{has also}} been a factor in the {{survival}} of the western lowland gorilla. The Ebola epizootic in western and central Africa has caused more than 90% mortality rate in western lowland gorillas. From 2003–2004, two epizootics infected the western lowland gorilla, which caused two thirds of their population to disappear. The outbreak was monitored in the Republic of Congo by Magdalena Bermejo and other field-based primatologists, as it also spread to humans through contact with <b>bushmeat.</b> The catastrophe led the World Conservation Union to designate the western lowland gorilla a critically endangered species. Malaria is also an issue that has been arising for the western lowland gorillas. Out of 51 faecal samples from habituated individuals, 25 were shown to have Plasmodium DNA. Laverania, which is a sub-genus of the Plasmodium genus of parasitic protozoa, was found in these studies. Varying exposure to different Anopheles mosquitoes transmitting Plasmodium species is known to be the origin of malaria in western lowland gorillas.|$|E
25|$|The western {{lowland gorilla}} {{population}} in the wild is faced {{by a number of}} factors that threaten its extinction. Such factors include deforestation, farming, grazing and the expanding human settlements that cause forest loss. There is a correlation between human intervention in the wild with the destruction of habitats and increase in <b>bushmeat</b> hunting. Another of these factors is infertility. Generally, female gorillas mature at 10–12 years of age (or earlier at 7–8 years) and their male counterparts mature more slowly, rarely strong and dominant enough to reproduce before 15–20 years of age. The fecundity of females, or capacity of producing young in great numbers, appears to decline by the age of 18. Of one half of captive females of viable reproductive age, approximately only 30% of those had only a single birth. However, these non-reproductive gorillas may prove to be a valuable resource since the use of assisted reproductive techniques aid in the maintaining of genetic diversity in the limited populations in zoos.|$|E
25|$|Control of {{outbreaks}} requires coordinated medical services, {{alongside a}} certain level of community engagement. The medical services include rapid detection of cases of disease, contact tracing of those who have come into contact with infected individuals, quick access to laboratory services, proper healthcare for those who are infected, and proper disposal of the dead through cremation or burial. Samples of body fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution. Prevention includes limiting the spread of disease from infected animals to humans. This may be done by handling potentially infected <b>bushmeat</b> only while wearing protective clothing and by thoroughly cooking it before eating it. It also includes wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease. No specific treatment or vaccine for the virus is available, although a number of potential treatments are being studied. Supportive efforts, however, improve outcomes. This includes either oral rehydration therapy (drinking slightly sweetened and salty water) or giving intravenous fluids as well as treating symptoms.|$|E
500|$|A newly {{emergent}} threat {{facing the}} golden-crowned sifaka is hunting by the gold miners {{moving into the}} region's forests. [...] Although mining operations are small scale, the practice of gold mining takes a toll on the forested regions because deep mining pits are often dug near or underneath large trees, disturbing the extensive root systems and ultimately killing {{the trees in the}} area. The influx of gold miners has also increased poaching pressure. Although the species is protected from hunting by local fady (taboo) around Daraina, due to their likeness to humans, and by Malagasy law, the gold miners who have immigrated to the area have begun to hunt the golden-crowned sifaka as a source of <b>bushmeat.</b> In 1993, David M. Meyers, a researcher who has studied the golden-crowned sifaka, speculated that if <b>bushmeat</b> hunting were to escalate, the species would go extinct in less than ten years since it is easy to find and not fearful of humans. [...] Indeed, <b>bushmeat</b> hunting by people from nearby Ambilobe has already extirpated at least one isolated population.|$|E
500|$|In general, lemur {{diversity}} {{has declined}} since {{the arrival of}} humans due to habitat loss, forest fragmentation, and <b>bushmeat</b> hunting. [...] At some subfossil sites, Pachylemur lived alongside as many as 19 or 20 other lemur species, but now as few as 20% of those species remain in those areas.|$|E
500|$|Humans {{arrived in}} Madagascar around 350BCE, {{but did not}} cause the {{extinction}} of Pachylemur and the other giant lemurs immediately. [...] Instead, many human-related factors, such as habitat loss, forest fragmentation, <b>bushmeat</b> hunting, {{and the introduction of}} invasive species, along with the gradual desiccation of certain parts of the island, caused their decline and eventual extinction over more than a millennium. [...] The same factors threaten all living lemur species today.|$|E
500|$|Okapis inhabit canopy forests at altitudes of [...] They are {{endemic to}} the {{tropical}} {{forests of the}} Democratic Republic of the Congo, where they occur across the central, northern and eastern regions. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the okapi as Endangered. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Extensive hunting for <b>bushmeat</b> and skin and illegal mining have also led {{to a decline in}} populations. The Okapi Conservation Project was established in 1987 to protect okapi populations.|$|E
