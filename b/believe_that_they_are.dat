5|$|Black Hebrew Israelites (also called Black Hebrews, African Hebrew Israelites, and Hebrew Israelites) are {{groups of}} African Americans who <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{descendants}} of the ancient Israelites. Black Hebrews adhere in varying degrees to the religious beliefs and practices of both Christianity and Judaism. They are not recognized as Jews by the greater Jewish community. Many choose to identify themselves as Hebrew Israelites or Black Hebrews rather than Jews in order to indicate their claimed historic connections.|$|E
5|$|Fielding was {{concerned}} with the audience's reaction to his various scenes. This is internally reflected in {{the actions of the}} character Merital in Love in Several Masques in controlling the behaviour of Helen and that many of his characters <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> either actors or are performing on a stage. Also, this is a primary concern of Fielding's when he crafted his Scriblerian plays.|$|E
5|$|Individuals who are {{intentional}} {{in their}} actions display regularity in their behavior. Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, {{and then use}} hands {{to make contact with}} and manipulate the object. Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness. They <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> experiencing the same world as others.|$|E
5000|$|Defenses {{of slavery}} were common among {{eighteenth-century}} Protestants, especially missionaries {{who used the}} institution to emphasize God's providence. Whitefield was at first conflicted about slaves. He <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> [...] "human", but he also <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> [...] "subordinate Creatures".|$|R

25|$|Four factors {{exist that}} cause {{a person to}} be optimistically biased: their desired end state, their {{cognitive}} mechanisms, the information they have about themselves versus others, and overall mood. The optimistic bias is seen {{in a number of}} situations. For example: people <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> less at risk of being a crime victim, smokers <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> less likely to contract lung cancer or disease than other smokers, first-time bungee jumpers <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> less at risk of an injury than other jumpers, or traders who think <b>they</b> <b>are</b> less exposed to losses in the markets.|$|R
5|$|Rose Tyler and the Doctor {{decide to}} visit Rose's mother Jackie. Jackie {{is pleased to}} see them, but makes a strangely happy remark that her {{deceased}} father will be joining them shortly. Despite Rose's protestations that her grandfather is dead, Jackie insists that he has returned and has been visiting her for some time. A vaguely humanoid and luminous silhouette appears in the flat, surprising both the Doctor and Rose but delighting Jackie before disappearing. TV broadcasts confirm {{that this is a}} worldwide phenomenon and Jackie explains that a few months previously millions of ghosts began appearing all over the world. Humans have come to accept them and <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the manifestations of loved ones.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{exist in}} an {{alternate}} Domain, and {{are referred to}} as creatures with no natural defenses. Most <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> fictional creatures; but a few, including the Dewclaws, know that they exist. This was developed further in 2003 by the introduction of the character Danielle, a human who enters the animal world via the Bermuda Triangle and transforms into a rabbit. However, she later has a son, Francis, who is born human. The series features jokes on a variety of topics. Many draw satirical parallels between its world and ours, making fun and sometimes social commentary on politics, sports, society, class-snobbery, school, technology, pop culture and corporate culture, for example; in January 2008 the Predator's Union was described as going on strike, in a parody of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E
5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing.|$|E

50|$|Geometrical {{designs were}} {{recorded}} at Freiha in four places. They measure 11 to 15 cm in width and 11 to 12 cm in height. Peter Glob <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> carved by an ancient fertility cult. This theory was disputed by Muhammad Abdul Nayeem, who <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> simply abstract symbols or tribal marks.|$|R

5|$|The {{number five}} {{is also found}} in the {{structure}} of the poem itself. Sir Gawain is 101stanzas long, traditionally organised into four 'Fits' of 21, 24, 34, and 22stanzas. These divisions, however, have since been disputed; scholars have begun to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the work of the copyist and not of the poet. The surviving manuscript features a series of capital letters added after the fact by another scribe, and some scholars argue that these additions were an attempt to restore the original divisions. These letters divide the manuscript into nine parts. The first and last parts are 22stanzas long. The second and second-to-last parts are only one stanza long, and the middle five parts are eleven stanzas long. The number eleven is associated with transgression in other medieval literature (being one more than ten, a number associated with the Ten Commandments). Thus, this set of five elevens (55 stanzas) creates the perfect mix of transgression and incorruption, suggesting that Gawain is faultless in his faults.|$|E

25|$|Optimism bias (also {{known as}} {{unrealistic}} or comparative optimism) is a cognitive bias that causes {{a person to}} <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> at a lesser risk of experiencing a negative event compared to others. Optimism bias is quite common and transcends gender, race, nationality and age.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the present}} church in Gamla Uppsala {{have been found}} the remains of one or several large wooden buildings. Some archaeologists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{the remains of the}} Temple of Uppsala, while others hold that comes from an early Christian wooden church.

25|$|Adventists {{believe that}} the Sabbath {{is not just a}} holiday but rather is {{intended}} as a rest for believers to grow spiritually.

25|$|For example, many smokers <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{taking all}} {{necessary}} precautionary measures {{so that they}} won't get lung cancer, such as smoking only once a day, or using filtered cigarettes, and believe that others are not taking the same precautionary measures.

25|$|Police {{officers}} are legally permitted to use force, and their superiors — {{and the public}} — expect them to do so. According to Jerome Herbert Skolnick, in dealing largely with disorderly elements of the society, some people working in law enforcement may gradually develop an attitude or sense of authority over society, particularly under traditional reaction-based policing models; {{in some cases the}} police <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> above the law.|$|E

25|$|Successful {{training}} of owls {{is much different}} from the {{training of}} hawks and falcons, as they are hearing- rather than sight-oriented (owls can only see black and white, and are long-sighted). This often leads falconers to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> less intelligent, as they are distracted easily by new or unnatural noises and they do not respond as readily to food cues. However, if trained successfully, owls show intelligence on the same level as that of hawks and falcons.|$|E
