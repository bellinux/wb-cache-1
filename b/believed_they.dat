5|$|The tarpan was a Eurasian {{wild horse}} that became extinct {{in the wild}} in 1879, due to hunting and {{crossbreeding}} with domesticated horses, and in 1887 the last captive horse died in Russia. The Heck horse {{was created by the}} German zoologist brothers Heinz Heck and Lutz Heck, director of the Berlin Zoo, at the Tierpark Hellabrunn (Munich Zoo) in Germany in their attempt to breed back the tarpan. The Hecks <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> could recreate the extinct tarpan subspecies by back breeding living descendants. They <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> could combine and rearrange the genetic material from these living descendants into a recreation of the extinct horse. Other breeders had the same idea, and used different genetic stock to attempt to recreate the tarpan or a reasonable look-alike. One result was a line of horses bred from American Mustangs by a breeder named Harry Hegardt.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} better {{team for the}} {{majority}} of the match, Liverpool were unable to beat the Independiente defence, with their shooting in front of goal being the culprit.

Incidentally, the referee had served half of his two match ban handed out by the Brazilian Football Association.|$|E
5|$|From the {{earliest}} times, the Chinese {{were concerned with}} the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91BC that in 780BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known {{at the time that}} earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.500–428BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460–370BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.585–c.525BC) <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384–322BC) <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> were caused by instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.|$|E

Shortly after the protest was rejected, Germany issued threats {{that they would}} punish all captured American soldiers that {{were found to be}} armed with a shotgun. This led to the United States issuing a retaliation threat, stating that any measures unjustly taken against captured American soldiers would lead to an equal act by the United States on captured German soldiers.|$|E

5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E

5|$|A few teams {{expressed}} interest in St. Louis. He chose to sign with the Tampa Bay Lightning as he <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> were {{the most likely to}} give him playing time in the NHL. He made his debut with the team on October 6, 2000. He struggled at first, failing to score a goal in the first six weeks of the season and again found himself out of the lineup at times. Realizing that he was at a career crossroads, St. Louis abandoned the changes to his game that his NHL coaches had impressed on him, trusting his own instincts. He scored his first goal of the season in late November, and finished the season with 18 goals and 40 points – 34 of which came after December 1.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> had consumed the edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had {{central nervous system}} manifestations and cholinergic symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the central nervous system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and muscimol, the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E

The next morning at 08:30 they arrived at Deir El Belah, where the division was now located. Casualties during the battle had again been rather light, at one dead and nineteen wounded. They had captured 197 prisoners, {{as well as the}} guns and field hospital.|$|E
