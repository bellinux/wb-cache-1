After the tide had been excluded, pits and <b>borings</b> were made to determine {{the nature of the}} bottom. A much narrower dock had been planned, but it was decided to move the south wall further south. A mole was added running along the middle of the dock, which increased the length of the quays.|$|E
5|$|The {{relocation}} {{and extension}} of the BMT Canarsie Line in the median of the proposed Queens Interborough and Cross–Brooklyn expressways to East Flatbush. On June 3, 1969, the Utica Avenue Line {{was approved by the}} Board of Estimate with a slight modification. Instead of ending at Kings Highway, it would end at Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U, with <b>borings</b> underway in 1970. Studies for the midtown people mover commenced in November 1969.|$|E
5|$|When <b>borings</b> {{were made}} in the 1870s prior to the {{building}} of chemical works a deep gorge measuring around 100 feet (30 m) was found in the bedrock which was filled with glacial deposits. From this it was concluded that before the Ice Age the Mersey had flowed in a more northerly course, and when it was blocked by glacial deposits it had made a new channel through Runcorn Gap.|$|E

5|$|Various {{estimates}} {{place the}} tree's seeding sometime between 1354 and 1361 AD. Using <b>borings</b> from the tree, the Smithsonian Institution {{determined that the}} Mingo Oak was the oldest tree of its species. In September 1932, West Virginia state forester D.B. Griffin and Emmett Keadle, president of the Mingo County Fish and Game Protective Association in Williamson, used an increment borer to estimate the tree as having begun its growth around 1356, with {{a margin of error}} within 25 or 30 years. Blueprints and boring samples were given to the West Virginia State Museum in Charleston and to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|There are argentiferous (i.e. silver-bearing) galena {{deposits}} on Flat Holm; {{the pits}} and mounds {{visible on the}} surface of the island are a result of trial <b>borings.</b> A dispute over lead mining rights in the 1780s ended with John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart making an official complaint that the lighthouse keeper was using the coals intended for the lighthouse for processing lead. Mining for lead was not profitable, however, and the works were abandoned. Red marl from the Triassic Period fills joints in the Carboniferous Limestone showing evidence of karstic (cave forming) processes during this period. Caves on the western and north-eastern sides of the island were used during the years of smuggling.|$|E
5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} MPC-D 107/15 {{has provided}} much {{information about the}} taphonomic processes (changes during fossilisation) in the Baruungoyot Formation. The specimen is preserved in facies that {{are thought to have}} been deposited through a sandstorm or dune-shift. It {{does not seem to have}} been transported after death, but the body appears to have shifted slightly to the right, indicating the sediment in which it was deposited came towards it from its left side. The neck is curved to the left, the left hand is folded backwards, and the legs are folded into a crouching position. The vertebral column, neck, and hips deteriorated during burial, and much of the damage to the skeleton is thought to have been caused by the activity of invertebrates. <b>Borings</b> in the bones, burrows, and reworked sediments (perhaps caused by the construction of pupal chambers) in the specimen indicate it was scavenged upon by colonies of skin beetles (Dermestidae) and perhaps other scavenging insects. There are many feeding traces in the joints of the skeleton, and almost all the surfaces where the bones articulated have been obliterated. There are also tunnels in the nest under the neck and skull, and no egg remains have been found in parts with such traces. Modern skin beetles mainly feed on muscle tissue but not on moist materials, and their activity is prevented by rapid burial. It is therefore thought that specimen MPC-D107/15 was only partially buried at first, with the upper part being exposed enough for a colony of skin beetles to develop. Some damage to the skeleton (especially in the vertebral column) may also have been caused by the scavenging of small mammals.|$|E
25|$|Even with <b>Boring's</b> {{influence}} {{on the field of}} psychology, he influenced other disciplines as well. In 1945, he was elected as the chairman of the Publications Committee of the American Philosophical Society.|$|R
25|$|<b>Boring's</b> minor {{research}} strayed too {{far from}} Titchener's definition of psychology. It was at Titchener's suggestion {{that he decided to}} do his thesis on visceral sensibility. He conducted the study by placing a stomach tube in his own stomach {{to learn more about the}} sensations of the alimentary tract. The results indicated that the stomach and esophagus were more sensitive to temperature and pressure than had been realized. The studies indicate his interest, from an early age, in the physical and experimental components of psychology. In 1914, <b>Boring's</b> efforts were rewarded when he received his Ph.D.|$|R
25|$|In 1933, James B. Conant became {{president}} of Harvard. Conant's interest in psychology was considerably greater than the former president's, and in 1934, he accepted <b>Boring's</b> motion to separate the psychology and philosophy departments. By removing the philosophy go-between, the official break between the disciplines freed the psychological science faculty {{to focus on the}} research and experimental psychology questions that they wanted to answer. Boring emphasized the use of the experimental method, rather than the tools of philosophy, to investigate psychological questions. <b>Boring's</b> mission was finally complete. Boring was made the first chair of the Department of Psychology, but 2 years later, he resigned the position to Gordon W. Allport.|$|R
25|$|<b>Borings</b> come in {{two main}} varieties, large-diameter and small-diameter. Large-diameter <b>borings</b> are rarely used due to safety {{concerns}} and expense but are sometimes used to allow a geologist or engineer to visually and manually examine the soil and rock stratigraphy in-situ. Small-diameter <b>borings</b> are frequently used to allow a geologist or engineer to examine soil or rock cuttings or to retrieve samples at depth using soil samplers, and to perform in-place soil tests.|$|E

50|$|Titchener's {{effect on}} the history of psychology, as it is taught in classrooms, was {{partially}} the work of his student Edwin Boring. <b>Boring's</b> experimental work was largely unremarkable, but his book History of Experimental Psychology was widely influential, as, consequentially, were his portrayals of various psychologists, including his own mentor Edward Titchener. The length at which Boring detailed Titchener's contributions—contemporary Hugo Münsterberg received roughly a tenth as much of <b>Boring's</b> attention—raise questions today {{as to whether or not}} the influence credited to Titchener {{on the history of}} psychology is inflated as a result. Boring recorded that Titchener had supervised 56 doctoral students, including 21 women. Two others did not formally graduate due to personal circumstances.|$|R

The United States Army Corps of Engineers and President Franklin D. Roosevelt endorsed the project but Congress never appropriated funds.

25|$|Titchener {{presented}} Boring {{with his}} first opportunity not only to teach but also to practice writing {{about the history of}} experimental psychology. Titchener wanted to redesign a systematic psychology course and enlisted his graduate students to do the job. It was a large task; the course covered the entire history of psychology in 3 lectures a week for 2 years. Boring {{and the rest of the}} team read through German literature on experimental psychology and many other primary sources of information to complete this project. The finished product was a 200-lecture course. The task sparked <b>Boring's</b> interest in the history that shaped the field; it would also serve as great training for <b>Boring's</b> later publication of his own text, The History of Experimental Psychology, in 1929. The work also gave Boring experience in teaching psychology. He continued to teach psychology at Cornell for 4 years but was glad when the war forced him to leave this position, as he felt that Cornell did not need him.|$|R
50|$|Brett's main {{contribution}} to psychology was his 3-volume History of Psychology (1912-1921), {{which was the}} first history of psychology written in the English language, pre-dating Edwin <b>Boring's</b> canonical History of Experimental Psychology (1929). Brett's text assesses the philosophy of mind theories of the time and presents psychology as the study of the immediate data of the inner life, distinguishes it from other sciences, and resists the new experimentalist approach.|$|R
