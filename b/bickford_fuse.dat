5000|$|A 3.7 {{inch pipe}} gun {{was an early}} improvised mortar. 18 were {{initially}} made by the Indian Corps in France by December 1914. It was a smooth tube firing a 4½ pound [...] "tin-pot" [...] filled with ammonal. The fuze was a length of <b>Bickford</b> <b>fuse</b> ignited by the burning of the propellant, which made it too dangerous for longterm use. By the end of June 1915 another 100 had been manufactured and sent to France and 20 to Gallipoli.|$|E
5000|$|Given the {{unreliability}} of fuses {{and means}} of detonation prior to <b>Bickford’s</b> <b>fuse,</b> this new technology changed the safety and conditions of mining. Due to poor record keeping or lack thereof, it is relatively difficult to determine {{the exact number of}} mining accidents and related statistics prior to the invention of the safety fuse. However [...] "this fuse soon replaced the less reliable fuses which were made of straws or quills filled with black powder, thus greatly reducing the hazard of accidental explosions in mining or construction." [...] Word of the reliability of <b>Bickford's</b> safety <b>fuse</b> spread, and was soon in large demand across world markets.|$|R
5000|$|The Ensign-Bickford Company (EBCo) {{was started}} in 1836 in Simsbury, Connecticut as a {{manufacturer}} of William <b>Bickford's</b> safety <b>fuse</b> for use in mining. Safety fuse was a great advance in mining technology over the practice of filling holes with black powder.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of special operations, {{conducted}} on 2-3 November, Abu Jafar {{and other members of}} the group, Mirza Babayev, Gadir Hajiyev, Vugar Aliyev, Emin Cami, Logman Muradov, Habil Masmaliyev and Parviz Karimov, were detained. Due to the witty measures of the National Security Ministry’s [...] "Gartal" [...] ("Eagle") special team, Abu Jafar was detained without damage. 1 AKMS submachine gun, 3 pistols, 1 rifle, 12 hand grenades, 11 special lighters, 1.075 grams of explosives, 4-meter long <b>Bickford's</b> <b>fuse,</b> 91 detonators, 4 pistol magazines, 4 submachine gun magazines, 25 bullets, about 600 cartridges, 3 special lanterns, 2 compasses, 1 signal firework unit, 1 electricity conducting device, maps and other supplies were discovered. Proceedings were instituted under articles 279.2, 315.2 and 228.2.1 of the Criminal Code of Azerbaijan.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bickford’s</b> <b>fuse</b> {{not only}} {{dramatically}} improved the safety conditions of mines around the world, but {{also contributed to}} the development of dynamite. Alfred Nobel created dynamite in 1867, by moulding nitroglycerine and a mud-like compound found near his laboratories called kieselguhr into individual cylinders. At the end of each cylinder Nobel inserted a blast cap which could be ignited in one of two ways. First, by inserting a safety fuse into the blast cap and igniting the fuse, it will set the blast cap off and produce enough energy to detonate the dynamite. Second, it is possible to detonate dynamite by inserting a blast cap into the end of the cylinder and then by attaching an electrical wire into the blast cap and producing a current which will travel from the source to the blast cap will also set off the dynamite.|$|R
5000|$|William Bickford {{took out}} a patent in 1831 for the safety fuse; a device for igniting {{gunpowder}} that saved many lives. With his son-in-law George Smith, he established a factory and {{in its first year}} produced [...] of <b>fuse.</b> <b>Bickford</b> died just before the factory opened.|$|R
5000|$|The British {{entered the}} war with the long-handled impact detonating [...] "Grenade, Hand No 1". The No. 15 [...] "Ball Grenade" [...] {{partially}} overcame its inadequacies. British forces however mainly used an improvised hand explosive that was at times more difficult to use, yet still useful in battle. This was the Double Cylinder [...] "jam tin" [...] which consisted of a tin filled with dynamite or guncotton, packed round with scrap metal or stones. To ignite, {{at the top of}} the tin there was a <b>Bickford</b> safety <b>fuse</b> connecting the detonator, which was lit by either a cigar, or a second person. The [...] "Mills bomb" [...] (Grenade, Hand No. 5") was invented during the war and came into use in 1915. Its improved fusing system killed more of the enemy and fewer of its users. The French meanwhile introduced the F1 defensive grenade.|$|R
50|$|An {{expedient}} formerly used {{to ignite}} <b>bickford</b> style safety <b>fuses</b> was {{to split the}} end of a safety fuse, place a match head into the split and tie the split back together, holding the match head against the powder core. This technique was slower, cumbersome and more failure prone than piercing and cross matching. Also, a single length of igniter cord could pass through and serially ignite multiple pieces of safety fuse attached to various charges in more complex, multiple charge blasting schemes. This technique and the several burn rate types of igniter cord manufactured by ICI could be used to implememt quite complex ignition sequences.|$|R
