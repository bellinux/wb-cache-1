The gap between assessment policy and practice can be bridged by aligning the policies with the assessment norms and developing teachers’ assessment literacy (Carless 2009).

40|$|Diffusion is an {{important}} dynamics that helps spreading information within an online social network. While there are already numerous models for single item diffusion, few have studied diffusion of multiple items, especially when items can {{interact with one another}} due to their inter-similarity. Moreover, the well-known homophily effect is rarely considered explicitly in the existing diffusion models. This work therefore fills this gap by proposing a novel model called Topic level Interaction Homophily Aware Diffusion (TIHAD) to include both latent factor level interaction among items and homophily factor in diffusion. The model determines item interaction based on latent factors and edge strengths based on homophily factor in the computation of social influence. An algorithm for training TIHAD model is also proposed. Our experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that: (a) homophily increases diffusion significantly, and (<b>b)</b> <b>item</b> interaction at topic level boosts diffusion among similar items.

Bifactor model estimation accuracy was evaluated through a simulation study with manipulated factors of percentage of common items, sample size, and degree of construct shift. In addition, the unidimensional IRT (UIRT) model, which ignores construct shift, was also estimated to represent current practice.

Specifically, teachers were asked to rate {{the degree to which they}} perceived their capabilities of performing 14 computer tasks on a three-point rating scale (0  = I do not think I can do this, 1  = I could work out how to do this, 2  = I know how to do this). Based on Bandura’s (1997) recommendations on measuring self-efficacy, the item stimulus referred to the degree to which they believed they can do these tasks. In total, 14 items were used to measure three factors of the construct with sufficient reliabilities: Self-efficacy in basic operational skills (ω = . 79, 6 items), self-efficacy in advanced operational and collaborative skills (ω = . 72, 4  items), and self-efficacy in using computers for instructional purposes (ω = . 76, 4  items).

40|$|We {{propose a}} method to {{exponentially}} speed up computation of various fingerprints, {{such as the ones}} used to compute similarity and rarity in massive data sets. Rather then maintaining the full stream of <b>b</b> <b>items</b> of a universe [u], such methods only maintain a concise fingerprint of the stream, and perform computations using the fingerprints. The computations are done approximately, and the required fingerprint size k depends on the desired accuracy ϵ and confidence δ. Our technique maintains a single bit per hash function, rather than a single integer, thus requiring a fingerprint of length k = O(1 /δ/ϵ^ 2) bits, rather than O(u · 1 /δ/ϵ^ 2) bits required by previous approaches. The main advantage of the fingerprints we propose is that rather than computing the fingerprint of a stream of <b>b</b> <b>items</b> in time of O(b · k), we can compute it in time O(b k). Thus this allows an exponential speedup for the fingerprint construction, or alternatively allows achieving a much higher accuracy while preserving computation time.

The predictions were empirically tested for twoalternative forced-choice, yes–no, and ratings recognition tasks. In the current article, the authors found that discrimination of low-frequency words increased as the proportion of high-frequency words studied increased. The results disconfirm the ALT prediction that recognition is insensitive to list composition, and they disconfirm the predictions of the REM model described by R. M. Shiffrin and M. Steyvers (1997). The current authors discuss a slightly modified version of REM that can better predict our findings, and we discuss the challenges the present findings pose for ALT and REM.

Background: Clinical practice guidelines recommend patient involvement in pressure injury prevention. There is some evidence that patients are willing to participate in this activity but there are currently no instruments to measure this participation. Design: This methodological study used data collected as part of a cluster randomised trial to modify and test the PPPIP scale. Methods: A sample of 688 of patients with complete PPPIP scale data was used. A stratified random subsample, (Subsample A) was created and the remainder became Subsample <b>B.</b> <b>Item</b> analysis, exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach’s alpha reliability were undertaken in Subsample A. Confirmatory factor analysis and Cronbach’s alpha reliability were undertaken in Subsample B. Data collection occurred between June, 2014 and May, 2015. Results: In Subsample A (n = 320), inter-item correlations, item total correlations met the acceptance criteria and an exploratory factor analysis identified a one factor solution. In subsample B (n = 368) the confirmatory factor analysis supported this one factor. In both subsamples the Cronbach’s alpha was 0. 86. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence of acceptable reliability and validity of the PPPIP scale in two subsamples of hospitalised patients who have limited mobility.
