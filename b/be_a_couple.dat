25|$|The exact {{location}} of the Chera capital has been subject to some speculation. The Chera capital has been called, 'Vanchi' and 'Karur' in several works. This has led to several theories identifying the Chera capital in places named Karur in both Kerala and Tamil Nadu. However, it is fairly clear that the capital was near the famous port known as Muziris, now identified to be near modern-day Kodungallur. Pliny refers to Muziris as the Chera capital, while {{the author of the}} Periplus identifies the capital to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of miles away {{from the mouth of the}} river at Muziris. Ptolemy who identifies the capital as 'Karoura' gives a geographical location that is very close to Muziris as well. The capital of the Cheras and the port of Muziris were very close and almost indistinguishable.|$|E

25|$|At Monza, he {{qualified}} in tenth, and had {{a rather}} lonely run {{in the race to}} finish in the same place to score another point. In Singapore, the FW32 sported a new front wing, and Barrichello put this to good use to set the sixth fastest time in qualifying, although Williams technical director Sam Michael reckoned the car was fast enough to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of positions higher. In the race despite losing places to Robert Kubica and Nico Rosberg at the start, Barrichello had a solid run to sixth at the finish. In Japan, he qualified in a strong seventh, he raced strongly before fading to ninth as he was overtaken by the two Saubers towards the closing stages of the race. It was later revealed that an apparent loss of grip he had suffered during the race was caused by a six per cent loss of downforce.|$|E
25|$|Sedimentary {{rocks are}} {{laid down in}} layers called beds or strata. A bed {{is defined as a}} layer of rock that has a uniform {{lithology}} and texture. Beds form by the deposition of layers of sediment on top of each other. The sequence of beds that characterizes sedimentary rocks is called bedding. Single beds can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of centimetres to several meters thick. Finer, less pronounced layers are called laminae, and the structure it forms in a rock is called lamination. Laminae are usually less than a few centimetres thick. Though bedding and lamination are often originally horizontal in nature, this is not always the case. In some environments, beds are deposited at a (usually small) angle. Sometimes multiple sets of layers with different orientations exist in the same rock, a structure called cross-bedding. Cross-bedding forms when small-scale erosion occurs during deposition, cutting off part of the beds. Newer beds then form at an angle to older ones.|$|E

[...] Pemberton suggested that a partial influence for the episode {{may have been the}} children's television series Brum. He said that he and Shearsmith had [...] "always wanted to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of robbers in that, so that might be where the idea came from".

The Telegraph includes {{it as one of}} its [...] "20 best travel books of all time", describing Newby and Carless's meeting with the explorer Wilfred Thesiger as a [...] "hilarious segment".

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{reviewed the}} episode, saying it [...] " [...] {{the bar for}} the rest of the season" [...] and was [...] "filled to capacity with comedy." [...] Jeremy Medina of Paste magazine commented that [...] "Do-Over" [...] was [...] "sort of like the first day of school after summer vacation: sort of awkward at times, but fast and buoyant and warmly familiar all the same." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote [...] "...this episode manages to do what the show has always done, mix crazy, almost surreal humor with a genuine (not manufactured) heart." [...] TV Guide contributor Matt Mitovich enjoyed [...] "Do-Over", and enjoyed Jack's story of trying to reclaim his job, along with Jack and Liz pretending to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> in front of Kathy. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin opined that premiere episodes [...] "tend to be 30 Rocks Achilles Heel. But the show comes roaring out of the gate with 'Do-Over', a show that definitively breaks the premiere jinx." [...] He said that the [...] "frenetic farcical plotting" [...] of Megan Mullally's character—in which she endured a disastrous trip to the 30 Rock studios, bumped her head, and lost her memory—"felt a little sitcommy but the laughs kept coming". In conclusion, Rabin gave this episode an A- grade rating.|$|E
500|$|Kevin McHale deemed [...] "Wheels" [...] the [...] "most serious" [...] {{episode of}} Glee so far. He enjoyed Artie's {{character}} {{development in the}} episode, explaining {{that when he was}} cast in the role, he did not know Artie's background and thus made up his own backstory for him. He believed that Artie became paralysed later in life, rather than being born that way, which was proven correct in [...] "Wheels". Of the burgeoning romance between Artie and Tina, McHale opined: [...] "I think Tina and Artie will be together. I think they will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> for a long time." [...] He explained that {{from the beginning of the}} show's production, creator Ryan Murphy expressed the belief that Artie and Tina should be together, and so he and Jenna Ushkowitz deliberately sat close to one another during filming, assuming that it would eventually happen. McHale was shocked by Artie's reaction to Tina's faked stutter, and was initially unsure [...] "why he was being so dramatic". He concluded however: [...] "I really think Artie fell for Tina because they were set apart by their disabilities. They're already kind of outcasts being in glee, but within that group they shared a connection. So he based their whole relationship on that and when it went away, Artie didn't know what to do." [...] McHale and Ushkowitz hope that their characters will ultimately become a couple, as they are best friends in real life.|$|E
500|$|Stan {{is modeled}} after Parker, while Kyle is modeled after Stone. Stan and Kyle are best friends, and their relationship, which is {{intended}} to reflect the real-life friendship between Parker and Stone, is a common topic throughout the series. The two do have their disagreements, but always reconcile without any long-term damage to their friendship. As {{is the case with}} his other friends and classmates, Stan is frequently at odds with Cartman, resenting Cartman's behavior and openly mocking his weight. Stan also shares a close friendship with Kenny, while Kenny professes that Stan is one of [...] "the best friends a guy could have". Stan can understand Kenny's muffled voice perfectly, and typically exclaims the catchphrase [...] "Oh my God! They killed Kenny!", following one of Kenny's trademark deaths, allowing Kyle to follow up with [...] "You bastards!" [...] Stan is the only character in the group to have had a steady girlfriend, Wendy Testaburger, and their relationship was a recurring topic in the show's earlier seasons. Despite reconciling and declaring to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> again in the season 11 (2007) episode [...] "The List" [...] after Wendy had dumped him in the season seven (2003) episode [...] "Raisins", their relationship has received relatively less focus in recent seasons. As a running gag, a nervous Stan often vomits whenever Wendy approaches to kiss or speak to him. In many episodes, Stan contemplates ethics in beliefs, moral dilemmas, and contentious issues, and will often reflect on the lessons he has attained with a speech that often begins with [...] "You know, I learned something today...".|$|E

500|$|Initial {{critical}} response towards Aurora {{was generally}} unfavorable. During the 1950s, Disney received [...] "harsh criticism" [...] for depicting both Cinderella and Aurora as [...] "naïve and malleable" [...] characters, {{and failing to}} acknowledge {{the ways in which}} women's roles in society had evolved since Snow White's debut in 1937. Critics agree that Aurora represents [...] "the classic damsel in distress" [...] by being depicted as a beautiful young woman who is rescued by a stranger. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times felt that the character was too similar to Snow White, writing, [...] "The princess looks so much like Snow White they could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of Miss Rheingolds separated by three or four years." [...] Time Out dismissed Aurora as a [...] "delicate" [...] and [...] "vapid" [...] character. Bustle's Mary Grace Garis wrote that the character [...] "suffers from having very little definable personality and ... serious Damsel-in-Distress syndrome". Sonia Saraiya of Jezebel echoed this sentiment, criticizing Aurora for lacking [...] "interesting qualities"; Saraiya also ranked Aurora Disney's least feminist princess. Similarly, Bustle also ranked Aurora the least feminist Disney Princess, with author Chelsea Mize expounding, [...] "Aurora literally sleeps for like three quarters of the movie ... Aurora just straight-up has no agency, and really isn't doing {{much in the way of}} feminine progress." [...] Dismissing the character as [...] "barely more than a cipher", Leigh Butler of Tor.com panned Aurora as [...] "a Barbie doll knockoff who does nothing the whole film but sing wistfully about Finding Her Man, before becoming the ultimate passive Damsel in Distress". However, Butler went on to defend the character somewhat, writing, [...] "Aurora’s cipher-ness in Sleeping Beauty would be infuriating if she were the only female character in it, but the presence of the Fairies and Maleficent allow her to be what she is without it being a subconscious statement on what all women are." [...] Similarly, Refinery29 ranked Aurora the fourth most feminist Disney Princess because [...] "Her aunts have essentially raised her in a place where women run the game." ...|$|E
