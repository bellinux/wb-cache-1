40|$|Public safety mobile {{wireless}} communication systems (PMCSs) {{are widely used}} by public safety personnel, such as firefighters and police, {{as well as local}} governments. PMCSs are crucial to protect safety and security of communities. Conventional PMCSs effectively cover underpopulated areas as well as urban areas by employing long-zone scheme. Since the PMCSs can cover areas that are not covered by commercial cellule systems, they play the important role as the only communication tool. Moreover, the conventional PMCSs have enhanced robustness and reliability. The conventional PMCSs can keep their services even if backbone lines are cut off. In contrast, short-zone scheme systems cannot offer stable and wide service area without <b>backbone</b> <b>line</b> connection. For example, the Great East Japan Earthquake in Japan, police mobile communication systems had kept their functions while cellular phones became disabled. PMCSs are required to be quite high robustness and reliability in order to save human life. Recently, conventional PMCSs are required to realize further expansion of service areas and high speed transmission although they have stably provided users with wide service areas so far. Nowadays, in order to solve complicated public affair quickly, more stable service areas and broadband communication are required. Compared with conventional PMCSs in urban areas, commercial wireless mobile communication systems (CWMCSs) such as cellular systems supply stable service areas and broadband communication in times of peace. In accordance with development of wireless technology, PMCSs need to keep pace with CWMCSs. However, conventional PMCSs can hardly realize further stable service areas and high speed transmission because of large-zone scheme. In terms of realization of further stable service areas, no-service areas cannot be eliminated easily. This is because no-service areas are mostly attributed to shadowing; in large-zone scheme, a no-service area that must essentially be covered by a certain base station is seldom covered by other neighboring base stations. Although new allocation of base stations is fundamental answer to solve no-service area problem in PMCSs, building new base stations of PMCSs that are not used for a commercial purpose is restricted by national and local budget. Realization of high speed transmission of PMCSs is also difficult because of large-zone scheme. To realize high speed transmission, increase of transmit power or shrinking of service area coverage is required to compensate Signal to Noise Power Ratio (SNR) deterioration caused by expanding bandwidth. Increase of transmission power of mobile station used in large-zone scheme systems is almost impossible because transmission power of mobile station is originally high. Thus, shrinking of service areas is necessary for high speed communication. Currently, to realize high speed transmission, next generation broadband PMCSs (BPMCSs) employing short-or middle-zone scheme are being developed. In the 3 GPP, it is considered that the Long Term Evolution (LTE) is used for communication of public safety. In Japan, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) has researched and developed Public Broadband Wireless Communication System (PBWCS), which employs 200 MHz as carrier frequency. The PBWCS has already been equipped in national police agency in Japan. However, we consider that the conventional narrowband PMCSs (NPM-CSs) are not replaced with the BPMCSs completely. This is because the BPMCSs cannot cover all the areas that the conventional NPM-CSs have covered. Moreover, there are problems of robustness and reliability when accidents happen. Hence, users of PMCSs will utilize both of NPMCSs and BPMCSs in accordance with the situation. In this case, users equipping several terminals feel inconvenient and also radio resources are not used effectively. The best solution to realize optimal PMCSs is employing heterogeneous cognitive radio (HCR) for PMCSs. By applying the HCR to PMCSs, service areas expansion and high speed transmission in PM-CSs will be realized effectively. We propose an integrated system combining NPMCSs with CWMCSs and BPMCSs to make communication quality of the PMCSs improve. The proposed HCR recognizes communication conditions of several systems and then provides PMCS 2 ̆ 7 s users with optimal communication quality. Although software defined radio techniques (SDR) are ideal to operate cognitive radio more flexibly, we deal with HCR mainly to realize combined systems in this thesis. We study advantages, problems, and their solution to realize the HCR for PMCSs. Firstly, we research service area expansion of NPMCSs using HCR. The proposed HCR is utilized for stabilization of NPMCS 2 ̆ 7 s service area. If communication quality of a NPMCS deteriorates owing to shadowing, the proposed HCR terminal obtains a part of NPMCS 2 ̆ 7 s data called subsidiary information (SI) from CWMCSs or BPMCSs. The proposed HCR terminal can improve PMCS 2 ̆ 7 s bit error rate (BER) performance by combining the SI with received signals of the NPMCS and then decoding the combined signals using forward error correction (FEC). Since convolutional codes are often used in FEC of NPMCSs, we consider BER improvement methods of the convolutional code. We derive modified Viterbi algorithm from maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) of the combined signals. Moreover, we introduce the distance spectrum to evaluate characteristics of the convolutional codes. The distance spectrum is used for estimating improvement of BER performances. Next, we consider synchronization methods to realize the proposed HCR. In the HCR, {{there are two types of}} synchronization method; one is the self-synchronization method to synchronize each system itself. The other is the co-synchronization method to combine different systems. In this thesis, we consider self-synchronization methods of NPMCSs mainly. This is because the HCR aims to improve communication quality of NPMCSs equipping conventional self-synchronization methods that are not probably available in low SNR environments. In this environment, since NPMCSs can hardly obtain their self-synchronization alone, powerful self-synchronization methods using HCR techniques are required. We propose two synchronization methods that are utilization of global portioning system (GPS) signals and utilization of the SI, respectively. The synchronization methods utilizing GPS signals can acquire timing synchronization. To obtain timing synchronization, the proposed HCR acquires accurate time and own location using the GPS signals. The HCR also gets the location of base stations and the frame timing by making the SI convey their information. Since the HCR can know accurate time and distance between the base station and the HCR, synchronization timing can be calculated. However, in GPS based method, preciseness of timing synchronization may be deteriorated by measurement error of GPS signals, diffraction caused by mountains, and propagation delay caused by reection. For this reason, we consider a mitigation method of the timing error and then evaluate BER performances using computer simulation. Moreover, we propose a SI based synchronization method that can obtain timing synchronization without GPS signals. The proposed method is employed when a NPMCS uses differential coded π/ 4 shift QPSK as the modulation scheme. The notable feature of the proposed method is to convey the phase rotation of the π/ 4 shift QPSK as the SI. The HCR can forecast PMCS 2 ̆ 7 s envelopes from the obtained SI and then obtain the timing synchronization by correlating the forecasted envelopes with real received envelopes. Since the proposed method can also be used for co-synchronization and BER improvement, CWMCS 2 ̆ 7 s resource consumption to convey the SI is suppressed. Finally, we consider HCRs combining several PMCSs. In this thesis, the combination of NPMCSs and the combination of a NPMCS and a BPMCS are researched. In the combination of NPMCSs, we consider that several PMCSs are integrated by SDR. In the combination of a NPMCS and a BPMCS, we propose site diversity based on HCR to improve uplink communication quality of the BPMCS. In this diversity, since uplink interference must be avoided, we employ combination of the adaptive array and HCR techniques. Moreover, we propose information compression methods for narrow band backbone lines so that received data can be conveyed to head office with little BER deterioration. PMCSs will have played an important role to ensure social safety. In the thesis, we consider the one of the next generation PMCSs employing SDR and HCR. Using this research, we can obtain a direction of optimal PMCSs. The next step that we need to perform is to apply our proposed method to actual radio systems. We must continue this research so that high reliable and compact PMCSs can be realized. 電気通信大学 201...|$|E

We propose a novel clustering algorithm in the framework of affinity propagation, which is a state-of-the-art message-passing technique with a graphical model approach developed in the machine learning field. Unlike conventional clustering approaches, the proposed clustering algorithm minimizes the total energy consumption while guaranteeing link reliability by adjusting the number of GOs. Simulation results verify that the IPSN optimized by the proposed clustering algorithm reduces the total energy consumption of the network by up to 31 % compared to the conventional clustering approaches.|$|R

Fiber-optic cables are the medium of choice for Internet backbone providers for many reasons.

We do this in two ways: 1) by expanding f (x) in a power series and using a perturbation method to compute the coefficients, and 2) by starting with a simple harmonic oscillator (which has a straight <b>line</b> <b>backbone</b> curve), and choosing a transformation which puts the resulting equation in the above form. We show that both methods result in a closed form expression for f (x) which involves the imaginary error function erfi(z) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} {{bandwidth}} allocation system by using GVA (Generalized Vickrey Auction), {{which can be}} used for leasing lines, reselling lines, or allocating bandwidth to individual users. In the proposed system, network resources, which are composed of many links at various bandwidths, are regarded as multiple items with multiple units. It is described how to apply the GVA protocol to bandwidth allocations among multiple users. Algorithmic and accounting issues are investigated, inside multiple nodes, in an end-to-end approach. Then, the performance of the proposed method is analyzed by using a computer simulation. In the simulation, the proposed method is compared with the other method in the conventional study and the simple first come, first served method. This analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed system. By adopting the proposed system, the total utility of users can be maximized and the utilization rate of network resources can also be improved.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing an ATM VP-based leased <b>line</b> <b>backbone</b> network. Given point-to-point communication demands having predefined sizes in a network, the problem is to find configurations of demand routes and link facilities installed on each edge satisfying all demands at minimum cost under some constraints. One {{of the most important}} constraints is that a single demand cannot be split over multiple link facilities. This is a sort of bin packing constraint. We propose an integer programming formulation of the problem and an algorithm to solve it. An efficient column generation technique to solve the linear programming relaxation is proposed, and a valid inequality is used to strengthen the integer programming formulation. The algorithm incorporates the column generation technique and the cutting plane approach into a branch-and-bound scheme. We test the proposed algorithm on some real problems. The results show that the algorithm can be used to solve the problems within reasonably small computing times. Ó 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{androgen}} receptor (AR) transcription factor {{plays a key}} role in the development and progression of prostate cancer, as is evident from the efficacy of androgen-deprivation therapy, AR is also the most frequently mutated gene, in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). AR has therefore become an even more attractive therapeutic target in aggressive and disseminated prostate cancer. To investigate mechanisms of AR and AR target gene activation in different subpopulations of prostate cancer cells, a toolkit of AR expressor and androgen response element (ARE) reporter vectors were developed. Three ARE reporter vectors were constructed with different ARE consensus sequences in promoters linked to either fluorescence or luciferase reporter genes in lentiviral vector <b>backbones.</b> Cell <b>lines</b> transduced with the different vectors expressed the reporters in an androgen-dependent way according to fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and multi-well fluorescent and luminescence assays. Interestingly, the background reporter activity in androgen-depleted medium was significantly higher in LNCaP cells compared to the prostate transit amplifying epithelial cell lines, EP 156 T-AR and 957 E/hTERT-AR with exogenous AR. The androgen-induced signal to background was much higher in the latter benign prostate cells than in LNCaP cells. Androgen-independent nuclear localization of AR was seen in LNCaP cells and reduced ARE-signaling was seen following treatment with abiraterone, an androgen synthesis inhibitor. The ARE reporter activity was significantly stronger when stimulated by androgens than by β-estradiol, progesterone and dexamethasone in all tested cell types. Finally, no androgen-induced ARE reporter activity was observed in tumorigenic mesenchymal progeny cells of EP 156 T cells following epithelial to mesenchymal transition. This underscores the observation that expression of the classical luminal differentiation transcriptome is restricted in mesenchymal type cells with or without AR expression, and presence of androgen...|$|R
40|$|In <b>backbone</b> networks, the <b>line</b> {{cards that}} drive {{the links between}} {{neighboring}} routers consume {{a large amount of}} energy. Since these networks are typically overprovisioned, selectively shutting down links during periods of low demand seems like a good way to reduce energy consumption. However, removing entire links from the topology often reduces capacity and connectivity too much, and leads to transient disruptions in the routing protocol. In this paper, we exploit the fact that many links in core networks are actually “bundles ” of multiple physical cables and line cards that can be shut down independently. Since identifying the optimal set of cables to shut down is an NP-complete problem, we propose several heuristics based on linear optimization techniques. We evaluate our heuristics on topology and traffic data from the Abilene backbone as well as on two synthetic topologies. The energy savings are significant, our simplest heuristic reduces energy consumption by 79 % on Abilene under realistic traffic loads and bundled links consisting of five cables. Our optimization techniques run efficiently using standard optimization tools, such as the AMPL/CPLEX solver, making them a practical approach for network operators to reduce the energy consumption of their backbones. 1...|$|R
40|$|Besides helping in the {{creation}} of protein, many RNA sequences fold into structures that are themselves important for regulatory, catalytic, and structural roles in cells. RNA structure is determined by base-pair interactions. These base-paired structures are called an RNA’s secondary structure. There are two approaches for RNA secondary structure prediction. The first and most reliable is Comparative Sequence Analysis: covarying residues are identified in a multiple sequence alignment of RNA with similar structures but different sequences (see Woese and Pace 1993). Unfortunately this method can not be applied in situations where we have only one RNA sequence or a small family of them. In those situations we can use a second method, energy minimization algorithms. It is these algorithms we will present in the next section. 1. 1 Algorithms for Prediction of Secondary Structure In this section b we present two algorithms for RNA secondary structure prediction. Both of the algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. First we will give some notation and definitions: • A horizontal continuous <b>line</b> represents the <b>backbone</b> of a RNA structure. • Base pairs will be represented by a wavy line. • Surface: a closed loop of solid (sequence or <b>backbone)</b> and wavy <b>line.</b> • Irreducible Surface (IS) : a special surface in which you cannot remove any line without breaking a surface (eg. A Hairpin). • Order (O) : the order of an IS is the number of base-pairs (wavy lines) that make it up (eg. Hairpin is O(1), bulge is O(2)). It {{is important to note that}} RNA secondary structure can be partitioned into irreducible surfaces and you can calculate the energy of the entire RNA 1 structure knowing the energy of each irreducible structure, i. e...|$|R
