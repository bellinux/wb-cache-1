5|$|MacArthur did not {{get along}} with Carpender, and twice asked {{for him to be}} {{replaced}}, only to <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed</b> in November 1943 when King replaced Carpender with Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid without informing MacArthur or seeking the approval of the Australian government. However, a face-saving formula was agreed upon. For the invasion of Leyte, the Seventh Fleet was massively reinforced by ships from the Pacific Fleet. Cover was provided by Admiral William F. Halsey's Third Fleet, which remained under Nimitz. At the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the divided command brought the Allies to the brink of disaster when misunderstandings arose between Kinkaid and Halsey. Allied Naval Forces was abolished, along with SWPA, on 2 September 1945.|$|E

25|$|One view of {{difference}} between shame and embarrassment says that shame does not necessarily involve public humiliation while embarrassment does; that is, one can feel shame for an act known only to oneself {{but in order to}} <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed</b> one's actions must be revealed to others.

25|$|In {{the prelude}} to the patriation of the Canadian {{constitution}} in 1982, some First Nations leaders campaigned for and some against the proposed move, many asserting that the federal ministers of the Crown {{had no right to}} advise the Queen that she sever, without consent from the First Nations, the treaty rights she and her ancestors had long granted to Aboriginal Canadians. Worrying to them was the fact that their relationship with the monarch had, over the preceding century, come to be interpreted by Indian Affairs officials as one of subordination to the government—a misreading on the part of non-Aboriginals of the terms Great White Mother and her Indian Children. Indeed, First Nations representatives were locked out of constitutional conferences in the late 1970s, leading the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) to make plans to petition the Queen directly. The Liberal Cabinet at the time, not wishing to <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by having the monarch intervene, extended to the NIB an invitation to talks at the ministerial level, though not the first ministers' meetings. But the invite came just before the election in May 1979, which put the Progressive Conservative Party into Cabinet and the new ministers of the Crown decided to advise the Queen not to meet with the NIB delegation, while telling the NIB that the Queen had no power. The ministers of the Crown eventually reversed their position and offered a similar invitation to constitutional talks, but the NIB party, consisting of over 200 people, had already departed for London.|$|E

Montreal rebounded to make the playoffs in 1995–96, but the future of the team was altered on December 2, 1995, when the Canadiens were embarrassed 11–1 by the Red Wings.

When describing the lyrics for his songs using Hatsune Miku as the vocalist, Ryo felt that writing without hesitation based on his initial ideas with minimal editing was best, because the singer, as a computer program, would not feel embarrassed about singing the lyrics. He admitted that his friends would laugh when he played the songs, but he thought that [...] "if a 16-year-old girl {{is supposed to be}} singing...it is best if she sings about romance."

500|$|Cott was a protege of John Graham Kerr who had quarrelled with Norman Wilkinson in the First World War about dazzle {{camouflage}} for ships. Wilkinson remained {{influential in}} 1939 as an inspector of camouflage, so a political argument developed. Cott {{was invited to}} camouflage a 12-inch rail-mounted gun, alongside a similar gun camouflaged conventionally. Cott carefully combined disruptive contrast {{to break up the}} gun barrel's outlines with countershading to flatten out its appearance as a solid cylinder. The guns were then photographed from the air from various angles, and in Peter Forbes's view [...] "the results were remarkable." [...] Cott's gun is [...] "invisible except to the most minute scrutiny by someone who knows exactly where to look and what to look for. The other gun is always highly visible." [...] The authorities hesitated, appearing to <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by the evidence that Cott was right, and argued that countershading would be too difficult to use as an expert zoologist would be needed to supervise every installation. Cott was posted to the Middle East, and Kerr unsuccessfully intervened, pleading for guns to be painted Cott's way and Cott to be brought home.|$|E

[...] Technical problems over the medal and {{the work on the}} mountain caused tensions, and political differences between Borglum, a Republican, and Randolph, an active Democrat, led to poor relations between the two. [...] Borglum, Venable, and Randolph backed different KKK members for national leadership.

[...] Borglum accused Randolph of using donations for his own benefit, and spending freely on an expense account. These dissensions became public, and in February 1925, the Association fired Borglum.

500|$|Though FreeStyleGames {{experimented with}} other options {{including}} a controller-less game, camera and motion detection, and social-based games, but recognized quickly that the guitar controller {{was a key}} part of the series' success. The developers recognized they wanted to have a guitar controller that players would not <b>be</b> <b>embarrassed</b> to have in their living rooms and spent time getting the look of the controller accurate to a real guitar. The design of the game's guitar controller was overhauled, using rapid prototyping to test potential guitar designs. The final design of the controller for Live utilizes a new design with six buttons arranged into two rows of three frets, designated by black and white-colored notes in-game, instead of using the traditional row of five colored frets used by previous Guitar Hero games. Jackson explained that the new layout was meant to make the game easier for new players, as the three-button layout avoids the need to use one's pinkie finger, a difficulty they recognized new players had on the traditional five-button controller. The layout was also designed to provide a new challenge to experienced players, including more realistic simulations of chords. The choice to use only three buttons also came from statistical analysis of past games, where about 80% of the players would never play harder than the Medium difficulty level which typically only required the use of three fingers with the previous five-button controllers. The initial controller iterations, presented both in-studio and to Activision, were met with skepticism but they found that players quickly adapted to the new scheme as an improvement over the older controllers. The [...] "note highways" [...] for the songs were created by both programmers and musicians using MIDI software as to map to each of the six controller buttons and the open strum bar. Note highways were developed first for the Expert difficulty level, essentially recreating the guitar part of the song note for note, while highways for lower difficulty levels were then constructed by removing notes while assuring the core rhythm of the song remained.|$|E
