5|$|Jagger {{has also}} had an {{intermittent}} acting career, most well-known {{for his role in}} Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg's Performance (1968), and as Australian bushranger Ned Kelly (1970). He composed an improvised soundtrack for Kenneth Anger's film Invocation of My Demon Brother on the Moog synthesiser in 1969. Jagger auditioned for the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter in the 1975 film adaptation of The Rocky Horror Show, a role that was eventually played by Tim Curry the original performer from its run on London's West End. The same year he was approached by director Alejandro Jodorowsky {{to play the role of}} Feyd-Rautha in Jodorowsky's proposed adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> never made it to the screen. Jagger appeared as himself in the Rutles' film All You Need Is Cash in 1978 and was cast as Wilbur, a main character in Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo, in the late 1970s. However, the illness of main actor Jason Robards (later replaced by Klaus Kinski), and a delay in the film's notoriously difficult production, resulted in him being unable to continue due to schedule conflicts with a band tour; some footage of Jagger's work is shown in the documentaries Burden of Dreams and My Best Fiend. In 1983 he starred in Faerie Tale Theatre's The Nightingale as the emperor. Jagger developed a reputation for playing the heavy later in his acting career in films including Freejack (1992), Bent (1997), and The Man From Elysian Fields (2002).|$|E

25|$|The 1951 movie , {{based on}} Young's biography, portrayed Rommel sympathetically, as a loyal, humane soldier and a firm {{opponent}} to Hitler's policies. The movie exaggerated Rommel's disputed {{role in the}} conspiracy against Hitler, while omitting Rommel's early association with the dictator. Critical and public reception in the US was muted, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> was a success in Britain, along with a less-known 1953 movie The Desert Rats, in which Mason reprised his portrayal of Rommel.|$|E

25|$|Later works, {{including}} Arthur Murphy's The Upholster, or What News? (1758) and William Hodson's The Adventures of a Night (1783), {{borrowed from}} the play and met with mixed results. The play was also transformed by Bernard Miles into the musical Lock up your Daughters (1959). The show was performed at the Mermaid Theatre on 28 May 1959 and lasted for 330 shows. It was shown in Boston, New Haven, and Toronto in 1960, Melbourne in 1961, again at the Mermaid Theatre in 1962, and later Pasadena and Fort Lauderdale in 1968 and at East Haddam and the West End in 1969. A film version was made in 1969, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> has little connection to the original play.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 1978, {{he started}} an ambitious tour of SFR Yugoslavia with Lokice dance group {{in support of}} the album that had already sold 150,000 copies. Čolić also started to play the guitar {{occasionally}} on stage. Putujući zemljotres (Traveling Earthquake Tour) produced and organized by Maksa Ćatović moved all over the country, soon becoming a phenomenon the likes of which the country had not seen before. The scenes of screaming girls rushing the stage were repeated in city after city. The tour's climax took place in Belgrade at Red Star FC stadium on 5 September 1978 with 70,000 people in attendance despite the fact that Čolić already played two sold out shows in Belgrade a few months earlier on 4 and 8 April at Hala Pionir. Supporting Čolić on stage that night were Chris Nicholls on keyboards and Dado Topić on bass guitar with old favourites Kornelije Kovač, Arsen Dedić, Kemal Monteno, Josip Boček, Trio Strune and RTV Belgrade singing quintet appearing as guests. Čolić and the massive tour essentially became a cultural phenomenon transcending musical boundaries such that in the lead up to the big Belgrade concert journalist Dušan Savković and film director Jovan Ristić decided to make a movie about Čolić. Savković wrote a rudimentary screenplay, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> ended up being a 90-minute feature documentary titled Pjevam danju, pjevam noću that follows Čolić from Belgrade concert onwards and looks back on his career up to that point. Two days after the Belgrade concert, Čolić was in his hometown Sarajevo at Koševo Stadium for the tour's grand finale, however the rain interrupted much of the concert and the whole thing {{turned out to be a}} little anticlimactic. By the end of its promotion cycle, the album sold more than 700,000 copies and with later re-releases during the 1990s went over the million mark.|$|E
500|$|The film faced {{allegations}} of plagiarism with similarities to [...] (1991), the Batman series, Iron Man (2008), The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010) and [...] (2010). Khan denied the allegations, saying, [...] "I got inspired {{from a lot}} of superhero movies <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> is original. In fact, Ra.One will be the first superhero-based movie in the world in which the superhero lives in a family." ...|$|E

500|$|When Niagara was {{released}} in January, women's clubs protested that the film was immoral, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> proved popular with audiences and grossed $6 million at the box office. While Variety deemed it [...] "clichéd" [...] and [...] "morbid", The New York Times commented that [...] "the falls and Miss Monroe are something to see", as although Monroe may not be [...] "the perfect actress at this point ... she can be seductive– even when she walks".|$|E
500|$|Quentin Tarantino {{was quoted}} as saying about the film's box office results, [...] "It was disappointing, yeah. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> worked with the audience. [...] People who saw it loved it and applauded. [...] I'm proud of my flop." [...] Harvey Weinstein said that he was so [...] "incredibly disappointed" [...] with the film's opening weekend that he was {{considering}} re-releasing it as two separate films and possibly adding back the [...] "missing" [...] scenes. The film altogether earned $25,422,088 in ticket sales.|$|E
500|$|Monroe and Miller {{separated}} after filming wrapped up, and she {{was granted}} a quick divorce in Mexico in January 1961. The Misfits was released the following month, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> failed at the box office. Its reviews were mixed, with Variety complaining of frequently [...] "choppy" [...] character development, and Bosley Crowther calling Monroe [...] "completely blank and unfathomable" [...] and stating that [...] "unfortunately for the film's structure, everything turns upon her". Despite the film's initial failure, it has received more favorable reviews from critics and film scholars in the twenty-first century. Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute has called it a classic, Huston scholar Tony Tracy has described Monroe's performance the [...] "most mature interpretation of her career", and Geoffrey McNab of The Independent has praised her for being [...] "extraordinary" [...] in portraying Roslyn's [...] "power of empathy".|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, writing, [...] "This premise is promising, <b>but</b> somehow <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> never really takes off." ...|$|R

500|$|In her {{review for}} The New York Times, {{based on a}} {{screening}} at the New York Film Festival, Manohla Dargis observes that [...] "throughout the movie Mr. Soderbergh mixes the wild beauty of his landscapes with images of Che heroically engaged in battle, thoughtfully scribbling and reading, and tending to ailing peasants and soldiers". According to Dargis, [...] "Che wins, Che loses, but Che remains the same in what plays like a procedural about a charismatic leader, impossible missions and the pleasures of work and camaraderie", referring to the [...] "historical epic" [...] as [...] "Ocean's Eleven with better cigars". However, Dargis notes that [...] "Mr. Soderbergh cagily evades Che's ugly side, notably his increasing commitment to violence and seemingly endless war, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> is without question political—even if it emphasizes romantic adventure over realpolitik—because, like all films, it is predicated on getting, spending and making money".|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Insurrection was mixed. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film {{a score of}} 55% based on 67 reviews, with critic consensus being that, [...] "Although not terrible, the sluggishly paced Insurrection plays like an extended episode of the TV series." [...] The Los Angeles Daily News said that the film had the [...] "bare bones {{of one of those}} pseudo-philosophical political allegories Trek has always done so entertainingly. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> blows it." [...] It praised the directing of Jonathan Frakes and the computer generated special effects and gave the film {{two and a half stars}} overall. The Daily Herald also gave the film two and a half stars, describing it as a [...] "slickly made" [...] movie with a plot [...] "scaled down to its TV roots", and criticized the [...] "frivolous" [...] romance between Riker and Troi. The Washington Times gave the film one and a half stars, saying that it was [...] "consistently flat-footed and slow on the uptake", and that there was [...] "ramshackle confusion during the climactic scenes".|$|E
500|$|Paramount Pictures {{dropped its}} {{original}} {{protest against the}} film after their director Ivan Reitman, re-titled his film No Strings Attached. Screen Gems then moved forward with the title Friends with Benefits. At the same time, NBC was developing a sitcom with the same title, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> production company stated that due to its production schedule, they didn’t expect an issue to arise. Screen Gems chose to accelerate production fearing that they would lose their title to the competing Paramount project. Director Will Gluck spoke about the frustration of comparing the two films, stating: [...] "I wish there was more space between them. The thing that's irking me now is people are saying we're remaking No Strings Attached. We're not remaking it. The two movies were being made at the same time." [...] Gluck, {{in an interview with}} The New Zealand Herald, said that both films are different. Similar sentiments were expressed by Kunis, stating, [...] "It's just two different movies. There's only [...] so many stories you can tell in the world. This {{is just one of the}} many." ...|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{hailed the}} film as a [...] "gentle, {{whimsical}} comedy", giving it a 3 and half stars of four, also stating: [...] "What makes [...] "Roxanne" [...] so wonderful is not this fairly straightforward comedy, however, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> creates a certain ineffable spirit".|$|R

5000|$|Brown {{began an}} acting career before the 1964 season, playing a buffalo soldier in a Western action film called Rio Conchos. The film premiered at Cleveland's Hippodrome theater on October 23, with Brown {{and many of}} his {{teammates}} in attendance. The reaction was lukewarm. Brown, one reviewer said, was a serviceable actor, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie's</b> overcooked plotting and implausibility amounted to [...] "a vigorous melodrama for the unsqueamish." ...|$|R
500|$|Blaxploitation was {{the first}} {{exploitation}} genre in which the major studios were central. Indeed, the United Artists release Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970), directed by Ossie Davis, {{is seen as the}} first significant film of the type. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> that truly ignited the blaxploitation phenomenon was completely independent: Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (1971) is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form: wildly experimental, borderline pornographic, and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution. Melvin Van Peebles wrote, co-produced, directed, starred in, edited, and composed the music for the film, which was completed with a loan from Bill Cosby. Its distributor was small Cinemation Industries, then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian Mondo Cane [...] "shockumentaries" [...] and the Swedish skin flick Fanny Hill, as well as for its one in-house production, The Man from O.R.G.Y. (1970). These sorts of films played in the [...] "grindhouses" [...] of the day—many of them not outright porno theaters, but rather venues for all manner of exploitation cinema. The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.|$|E
500|$|Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote, [...] "'Chennai Express' {{feels like}} a sumptuous meal with {{carefully}} chosen wine and tasty appetizers but a botched main course. Money and visual care have been lavished on this Bollywood action-comedy-romance and glossy stars engaged (Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone). <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> chugs along {{for most of its}} 2 hours and 20 minutes searching for comedy and characters in a frantically overplotted story." [...] Sneha May Francis of Emirates 24/7 wrote, [...] "Rohit Shetty's s(h)tyle of romance relies heavily on buffoonery and will be applauded mainly by Shah Rukh Khan loyalists". She added, [...] "Rohit's carnival-like comedy coaxes some laughs, but can leave you exhausted." [...] Sneha said that Padukone's performance [...] "outshines" [...] that of Khan. Ronnie Scheib of Variety wrote, [...] "Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone are ill matched in this overworked comedy/romance/actioner...Shetty's need to maintain his characters' romantic heroism constantly grates against his depictions of their ridiculousness." [...] Simon Foster of the Special Broadcasting Service gave the film 2 stars out of 5 and described it as [...] "a loud, lame-brained romantic comedy from the (very) broad directorial brush of Rohit Shetty, SRK's over-hyped vehicle sees the charismatic but ageing actor badly miscast and easily overshadowed by his leading lady, Deepika Padukone." ...|$|E
500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{reported}} that 92% of critics gave the film positive write-ups, {{based on a}} sample of 154, with an average score of 8/10, with del Toro receiving widespread acclaim, and the consensus being [...] "Soderbergh successfully pulls off the highly ambitious Traffic, a movie with three different stories and a very large cast. The issues of ethics are gray rather than black-and-white, with no clear-cut good guys. Terrific acting all around." [...] At Metacritic the film has received an average score of 86, based on 34 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "The movie is powerful precisely because it doesn't preach. It is so restrained that at one momentthe judge's final speechI wanted one more sentence, making a point, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> lets us supply that thought for ourselves". Stephen Holden, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "Traffic is an utterly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller. Or rather it is several interwoven thrillers, {{each with its own}} tense rhythm and explosive payoff". In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Traffic marks [...] definitively as an enormous talent, one who never lets us guess what he's going to do next.

500|$|The New York Times critic Janet Maslin {{felt the}} film lacked any real plot, failed in its attempt at satire, should have {{included}} Myron's only mentioned son and [...] "mostly wasted" [...] Hartman, while Levant's direction was [...] "listless". Similarly, the BBC's Neil Smith criticized the film's script, {{its focus on}} the commercialization of Christmas, as well as Schwarzenegger's performance which shows [...] "the comic timing of a dead moose," [...] but singled out Hartman for praise. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Wilmington panned the film, wondering why the characters (primarily Howard) acted so illogically: [...] "Howard Langston {{is supposed to be}} a successful mattress manufacturer, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> paints him as a hot-tempered buffoon without a sensible idea in his head." [...] Jack Garner of USA Today condemned the film, finding it more [...] "cynical" [...] than satirical, stating [...] "this painfully bad movie has been inspired strictly by the potential jingle of cash registers." [...] He wrote of Levant's directorial failure as he [...] "offers no...sense of comic timing," [...] while [...] "pauses in the midst of much of the dialogue are downright painful." [...] Trevor Johnston suggested that the film [...] "seems to mark a point of decline in the Schwarzenegger career arc" [...] and the anti-consumerism message largely failed, with [...] "Jim Belushi's corrupt mall Santa with his stolen-goods warehouse...provid the film's sole flash of dark humour." ...|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{called it}} [...] "a true movie milestone, {{presenting}} awe- and fear-inspiring sights {{never before seen}} on the screen... On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents... t becomes less crisp on screen than {{it was on the}} page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away." [...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers described the film as [...] "colossal entertainment—the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen." [...] Roger Ebert noted, [...] "The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values." [...] Henry Sheehan argued, [...] "The complaints over Jurassic Parks lack of story and character sound a little off the point," [...] pointing out the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond's grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them.
