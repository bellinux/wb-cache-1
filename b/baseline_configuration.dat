5|$|At {{the time}} it was known that the drag at {{supersonic}} speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing. This led to the use of very short-span, very thin rectangular wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter or the Avro 730 that the team studied. The team outlined a <b>baseline</b> <b>configuration</b> that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, a twinjet layout, {{similar to}} the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the <b>baseline</b> <b>configuration.</b> The {{decision}} to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.|$|E

The <b>baseline</b> slot <b>configurations</b> are simply modified by thickening the slot lip and by elevating {{the location of the}} slot exit above the flat plate.

25|$|The Terrex AV81 is an {{armoured}} fighting vehicle weighing between 25 and 30 tons an 8×8 {{wheeled chassis}} and modern armour. Multiple weapon platforms are supported, including both the remote and overhead weapons stations. The Terrex's modular design allows for different level of armour protection and weapon systems. It {{is designed to}} be air-portable by C-130s or equivalent cargo aircraft. The Terrex uses a patented independent double wishbone suspension, which greatly improves ground mobility and comfort during rides over rough terrains. The use of automatic traction control and the capacity for large footprint off-road tyres enables the Terrex to reach high speed on soft ground. The vehicle has a double hull with an external V-hull that improves mine blast survivability. Add-on armour provides further protection for troops. It is also capable of providing full chemical, biological and nuclear protection in extreme operational conditions. The <b>baseline</b> <b>configuration</b> is fully amphibious. Two water jets mounted on either side {{at the back of the}} hull propel the vehicle through water at 10km/h. Initially developed for export sales from the number of emerging wheeled armoured vehicle requirements including U.S. Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) concept, which calls for the need of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles (AFV) as opposed to tracked AFVs. In 2006, the SAF decided to purchase 135 units to replace their aging V-200 armoured vehicles. The Indonesian Army also indicated plans to purchase 420 units and to produce the Terrex under license locally.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary human {{acceptability}} {{studies of}} sonic booms indicate that supersonic flight {{is unlikely to}} be acceptable even at noise levels significantly below 1994 low boom designs (reference 1, p. 288). Further, these low boom designs represent considerable changes to <b>baseline</b> <b>configurations,</b> and changes translate into additional effort and uncertain structural weight penalties that may provide no annoyance benefit, increasing the risk of including low boom technology. Since over land sonic boom designs were so risky (and yet the acceptability studies highlight how annoying sonic booms are), boom softening studies were undertaken to reduce the boom of <b>baseline</b> <b>configurations</b> using minor modifications that would not significantly change the designs. The goal of this work is to reduce boom levels over water. Even though Concorde over water boom has not been found to have any adverse environmental impact, boom levels for baseline HSCT designs are 50 % higher in overpressure than the Concorde (due to a doubling in configuration weight with only a 50 % increase in length) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{previously}} validated computational approach {{applied to}} an 18 %-scale, semi-span Gulfstream aircraft model {{was extended to}} the full-scale, full-span aircraft in the present investigation. The full-scale flap and main landing gear geometries used in the simulations are nearly identical to those flown on the actual aircraft.
