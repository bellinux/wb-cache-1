40|$|Up to {{now it was}} not {{possible}} to design and use rotating <b>biological</b> <b>disc</b> units for a specific nitrogen removal. To fullfil the stringent requirements regarding the effluent concentrations of total nitrogen, it was often necessary to rebuild these treatment plants with high financial expenses. The scope of this research project was to prove the suitability of rotating biological contactors (RBC) for controlled nitrogen removal and to find design criteria for pre-denitrification. With two full-scale RBCs (1, 200 m" 2 disc-area each) investigations of pre-denitrification were carried out for a period of one year. By an air-tight plastic cover the transfer of oxygen to the partially submerged discs was prevented. The two experimental RBCs were integrated as the first stage in an existing, nitrifying RBC treatment plant. The large-scale pilot plant was charged with domestic wastewater from the treatment plant of the University of Stuttgart. It was possible to prove successfully the use of covered RBCs for controlled nitrogen removal by pre-denitrification. The operation was stable and without any problems. The denitrification capacities, reached during the experiments, are comparable to similar reactors for pre-denitrification. With the found design criteria and operation instructions it is possible to design and operate covered RBCs for pre-denitrification. (orig.)

40|$|Low {{back pain}} that is {{associated}} with disc degeneration contributes to a huge economic burden in the worldwide healthcare system. Traditional methods, such as spinal fusion, have been adopted to relieve mechanical back pain, but this is compromised by decreased spinal motion. Tissue engineering has attracted much attention, and aims to correct the changes fundamentally occurring in the discs by a combination of cell biology, molecular biology and engineering. Synthetic materials including poly(l-lactic acid) or poly(glycolic acid) and biomolecules like hyaluronic acid or collagen have been adopted in the development of disc scaffolds for studying therapeutic approaches. Nevertheless, the complex biological and mechanical environment of the intervertebral disc (IVD) makes the synthesis of an artificial IVD with biomaterials a difficult task. Thus the aim {{of this study was to}} develop a natural disc scaffold for culturing disc cells for future development of <b>biological</b> <b>disc</b> constructs. We adopted a combination of currently used decellularization techniques to decellularize bovine IVD to create a complete endplate-to-endplate IVD scaffold. By altering the chemical and physical decellularization parameters, we reported the removal of up to 70 % of the endogenous cells, and were able to preserve the glycosaminoglycan content, collagen fibril architecture and mechanical properties of the discs. The reintroduction of nucleus pulposus cells into the scaffold indicated a high survival rate over 7 days, with cell penetration. We have shown here that conventional methods used for decellularizing thin tissues can also be applied to large organs, such as IVD. Our findings suggest the potential of using decellularized IVD as a scaffold for IVD bioengineering and culturing of cells in the context of the IVD niche. © 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|Purpose Regenerative {{strategies}} aim {{to restore}} the original biofunctionality of the intervertebral disc. Different biomaterials are available, which might support disc regeneration. In the present study, the prospects of success of two hydrogels functionalized with anti-angiogenic peptides and seeded with bone marrow derived mononuclear cells (BMC), respectively, were investigated in an ovine nucleotomy model. Methods In a one-step procedure iliac crest aspirates were harvested and, subsequently, separated BMC were seeded on hydrogels and implanted into the ovine disc. For the cell-seeded approach a hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel was used. The anti-angiogenic potential of newly developed VEGF-blockers was investigated on ionically crosslinked metacrylated gellan gum hydrogels. Untreated discs served as nucleotomy controls. 24 adult merino sheep were used. After 6 weeks histological, after 12 weeks histological and biomechanical analyses were conducted. Results Biomechanical tests revealed no differences between any of the implanted and nucleotomized discs. All implanted discs significantly degenerated compared to intact discs. In contrast, there was no marked difference between implanted and nucleotomized discs. In tendency, albeit not significant, degeneration score and disc height index deteriorated for all {{but not for the}} cell-seeded hydrogels from 6 to 12 weeks. Cell-seeded hydrogels slightly decelerated degeneration. Conclusions None of the hydrogel configurations was able to regenerate biofunctionality of the intervertebral disc. This might presumably be caused by hydrogel extrusion.

40|$|Low {{back pain}} affects 85 % of the {{population}} and carries a socioeconomic price tag of $ 100 billion USD per year. Lumbar intervertebral disc disease is strongly implicated as a causative factor in back pain, as degeneration, which is ubiquitous in the population, leads to loss of normal spine function. For these reasons, our lab has developed disc-like angle ply structures (DAPS) for total disc replacement. These cell-seeded replacements are designed to match the natural hierarchical structure and function of the native disc and correct spinal kinematics after end-stage disc disease. ^ In this dissertation, I describe the development of a rat caudal spine (tail) model of total disc replacement as a platform to evaluate DAPS in vivo; an external fixation system that immobilized caudal vertebrae at the site of implantation was required for DAPS retention and a radiopaque scaffold was developed to confirm intervertebral DAPS positioning. A detailed analysis of the DAPS in vitro growth trajectory was performed to select the optimum pre-culture duration before implantation. Cell-seeded DAPS were subsequently implanted in the rat tail and evaluated by histological, mechanical, and MRI analyses. DAPS successfully restored the mechanical properties of the native motion segment in compression, providing the first evidence of the efficacy of engineered disc replacements. Adaptations of the implant to the in vivo environment were identified; there was a reduction in glycosaminoglycan after implantation, structural modifications to the NP material, and no evidence of vertebral integration. In tackling the first of these issues, a pre-culture strategy that primed DAPS for the in vivo environment was developed; using a rat subcutaneous model, implant phenotype was best conserved post-implantation using a pre-culture strategy with a transient high dose of TGF-b 3. Future work will address maintenance of NP structure, vertebral integration and scaling up to human sizes. ^ In my work, the most promising finding was that DAPS replicated compressive motion segment mechanical properties after implantation supporting the idea that engineered <b>biological</b> <b>disc</b> replacement is a possibility for clinical treatment of advanced disc disease. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECT: There is an unmet {{need for}} a {{procedure}} that could generate a <b>biological</b> <b>disc</b> substitute {{while at the same}} time preserving the normal surgical practice of achieving anterior cervical decompression. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that adult allogeneic mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) formulated with a chondrogenic agent could synthesize a cartilaginous matrix when implanted into a biodegradable carrier and cage, and over time, might serve as a dynamic interbody spacer following anterior cervical discectomy (ACD). METHODS: Eighteen ewes were divided randomly into 3 groups of 6 animals. Each animal was subjected to C 3 - 4 and C 4 - 5 ACD followed by implantation of bioresorbable interbody cages and graft containment plates. The cage was packed with 1 of 3 implants. In Group A, the implant was Gelfoam sponge only. In Group B, the implant consisted of Gelfoam sponge with 1 million MPCs only. In Group C, the implant was Gelfoam sponge with 1 million MPCs formulated with the chondrogenic agent pentosan polysulfate (PPS). In each animal the cartilaginous endplates were retained intact at 1 level, and perforated in a standardized manner at the other level. Allogeneic ovine MPCs were derived from a single batch of immunoselected and culture-expanded MPCs isolated from bone marrow of outbred sheep (mixed stock). Radiological and histological measures were used to assess cartilage formation and the presence or absence of new bone formation. RESULTS: The MPCs with or without PPS were safe and well-tolerated in the ovine cervical spine. There was no significant difference between groups in the radiographic or histological outcome measures, regardless of whether endplates were perforated or retained intact. According to CT scans obtained at 3 months after the operation, new bone formation within the interbody space was observed in the Gelfoam only group (Group A) in 9 (75 %) of 12 interbody spaces, and 11 (92 %) of 12 animals in the MPC cohort (Group B) had new bone formation within the interbody space. Significantly, in the MPC & PPS group (Group C), there were only 1 (8 %) of 12 levels with new bone formation (p = 0. 0009 vs Group A; p = 0. 0001 vs Group B). According to histological results, there was significantly more cartilaginous tissue within the interbody cages of Group C (MPC & PPS) compared with both the control group (Group A; p = 0. 003) and the MPC Group (p = 0. 017). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the feasibility of using MPCs in combination with PPS to produce cartilaginous tissue to replace the intervertebral disc following ACD. This biological approach may offer a means preserving spinal motion and offers an alternative to fusion to artificial prostheses.

40|$|Current {{treatments}} to intervertebral disc degeneration alter spine biomechanics and have complications. Tissue engineering offers {{an approach to}} regenerate a <b>biological</b> <b>disc</b> that provides flexibility and stability to, and integrates with the spine. To date, a scaffold that mimics the extracellular matrix composition and mechanical strength of a native disc is lacked. In this project, a biphasic scaffold was fabricated using glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen, the prevalent ma-trix components in a native disc. It also adapted {{the structure of the}} disc, with la-mellae of collagen surrounding a collagen-GAG (CG) core. The first part of this project studied chemical modification of CG and evaluated the physiochemical and biological properties of modified CGs. As only loosely bound by GAG under physiological environment, collagen was modified by deamination, methylation and amination, and yielded Deaminated, Methylated and Aminated CGs upon co-precipitation with GAG. While GAG was mostly lost within 1 day in Untreated and Deaminated CGs, 20 % and 40 % GAG was retained after 6 days in Methylated and Aminated CGs respectively. In cell-seeded Aminated CG, over 60 % GAG was retained after 8 days. Aminated CG, having the highest GAG/HYP of 4. 5, best simulated the GAG-rich nucleus pulposus tissue. In ultrastructural analysis, Aminated CG consisted of abundant granular sub-stances that resembled the nucleus pulposus. Despite the differential initial number adhered to the CG scaffolds, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) had over 90 % viability at all time points. Cell morphology was distinct, being round in Untreated and Methylated CGs but elongated in Deaminated and Aminated ones. The adhesion of hMSCs via collagen receptor, integrin alpha 2 beta 1, was observed in all CG scaffolds, while adhesion via general matrix receptor, integrin alphaV, was extensive in all but Aminated CG. Based on improved GAG incor-poration and retention, which approximate the matrix composition of nucleus pulposus, Aminated CG was chosen as the core of the biphasic scaffold. The second part of this project studied lamination in biphasic disc scaffold and evaluated its mechanical properties in creep, recovery and dynamic loadings. A process was optimized to encapsulate a CG under physiological condition whilst producing an intact collagen gel, which allowed the CG to retain more GAGs and to be confined by the annulus structurally as was in the disc. This encasing approach was repeated for multiple lamellae, one lamella per day. Scaffolds with more lamellae had increased viscous compliance in creep and recovery, which was explained by the less laminated scaffolds being overloaded. Another lamination approach replaced most encasing lamellae with coiling ones. Despite low sample size, it was shown that this combined approach produced scaffolds with lower elastic and viscous compliances and longer equilibrating time in both creep and recovery, and higher complex modulus under dynamic loading. Full recovery was not achieved by any scaffold. This study demonstrated that a biphasic disc scaffold, made of GAG and collagen, contained similar matrix components to native disc, was almost mechanically comparable to the disc, and was cyto-compatible. It paved way towards tissue engineering of intervertebral disc and the intervertebral disc motion segment. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|The "gold standard" for {{treatment}} of intervertebral disc herniations and degenerated discs is still spinal fusion, corresponding to the saying "no disc - no pain". Mechanical prostheses, which are currently implanted, do only have medium outcome success and have relatively high re-operation rates. Here, we discuss some of the <b>biological</b> intervertebral <b>disc</b> replacement approaches, which can be subdivided into at least two classes in accordance to the two different tissue types, the nucleus pulposus (NP) and the annulus fibrosus (AF). On the side of NP replacement hydrogels have been extensively tested in vitro and in vivo. However, these gels are usually a trade-off between cell biocompatibility and load-bearing capacity, hydrogels which fulfill both are still lacking. On the side of AF repair much less is known {{and the question of}} the anchoring of implants is still to be addressed. New hope for cell therapy comes from developmental biology investigations on the existence of intervertebral disc progenitor cells, which would be an ideal cell source for cell therapy. Also notochordal cells (remnants of the embryonic notochord) have been recently pushed back into focus since these cells have regenerative potential and can activate disc cells. Growth factor treatment and molecular therapies could be less problematic. The biological solutions for NP and AF replacement are still more fiction than fact. However, tissue engineering just scratched the tip of the iceberg, more satisfying solutions are yet {{to be added to the}} biomedical pipeline...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{describe}} a direct-detection immunoassay that uses high-speed optical interferometry on a <b>biological</b> compact <b>disc</b> (BioCD). Methods: We fabricated phase-contrast BioCDs from 100 -mm diameter 1. 1 -mm thick borosilicate glass disks {{coated with a}} 10 -layer dielectric stack of Ta 2 O 5 /SiO 2 {{that serves as a}} mirror with a center wavelength at 635 nm. The final layer is a lambda/ 4 layer of SiO 2 onto which protein patterns are immobilized through several different chemical approaches. Protein on the disc is scanned by a focused laser spot as the disc spins. Interaction of the light with the protein provides both a phase-modulated signal and a local reference that are combined interferometrically to convert phase into intensity. A periodic pattern of protein on the spinning disc produces an intensity modulation as a function of time that is proportional to the surface-bound mass. The binding of antigen or antibodies is detected directly, without labels, by a change in the interferometric intensity. The technique is demonstrated with a reverse assay of immobilized rabbit and mouse IgG antigen incubated against anti-IgG antibody in a casein buffer. Results: The signal increased with increased concentration of analyte. The current embodiment detected a concentration of 100 ng/L when averaged over similar to 3000 100 -micron-diameter protein spots.

In this study, we have seeded multipotent, adult human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into a novel biomaterial amalgam to develop a biphasic construct that consisted of electrospun, biodegradable nanofibrous scaffold (NFS) enveloping a hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel center.

[...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of <b>Biological</b> SciencesIntervertebral <b>discs</b> {{within the}} human spine act as shock {{absorbers}} between {{each of the}} vertebrae in the spinal column. As people age, disc cells are constantly subjugated to degenerating stress by various mechanical and environmental factors leading to musculoskeletal impairment and lower back pain. Nucleus pulposus cells (NP cells), jelly-like avascular tissue within {{the middle of the}} intervertebral disc, are crucial component of the disc Disc degeneration starts here in these cells. Research into regenerating the NP cells in degenerating intervertebral discs may provide a breakthrough in treating spine disorders. This project is designed to fabricate and characterize hydrogel composites to investigate the growth and viability of human nucleus pulposus (HNP) cells and the extracellular matrix gene expression by the HNP cells in the hydrogel. Specifically, we fabricated type II collagen and hyaluronic acid hydrogels that were cross-linked with the ethyl- 3 (3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide crosslinker (NHS). The hydrogels were cross-linked using varying concentrations of the crosslinkers. HNP were seeded into crosslinked and non-crosslinked hydrogels. Results from cell viability assays such as live/dead assay and AlamarBlue assay showed cell growth and proliferation in both non-crosslinked and crosslinked hydrogels. Quantitative PCR assay demonstrated the extracellular matrix gene expression by the cells cultured in these gels. The results of gene expression studies indicated the formation of extracellular matrix by the cells and adaption of cells to the environment after long-term cell culture in these hydrogels. This study suggests that the type II collagen-HA hydrogel and crosslinked hydrogel with EDC at low concentration are a permissive matrix for the growth of HNP cells and can potentially be applied to NP repair...|$|R
40|$|The writer {{recognised}} in {{the early}} 1970 s {{that there was a}} need to focus on improvements to on-site wastewater treatment technology, effluent disposal and associated aspects of water pollution control. At the time there was considerable potential for applied research in the development of improved treatment and effluent disposal technologies since some 16 to 20 % of the populations in New Zealand and Australia relied on on-site or decentralised wastewater treatment and effluent disposal. This thesis covers applied research projects undertaken in New Zealand, during the period 1974 - 1990, and in Queensland from 1992 to the present day. These experiences have been written up {{in the form of a}} guide to the dissertation (contained within the initial three chapters) and eight technical portfolios. During University of Auckland post-graduate studies in 1974 the writer reviewed the unique problems of widely fluctuating wastewater loads from coastal and lakeside communities, camping grounds and resort areas. The review evaluated improvements to septic tanks, alternative effluent disposal systems, upflow pebble filters, lagoons, rotating <b>biological</b> <b>discs,</b> and composting toilets. Solutions for handling fluctuating wastewater loads have been further extended. Due to failed effluent trenches in Northland New Zealand, associated mainly with problem clay type soils, the writer undertook experimental work on the determination of soil permeability by field and laboratory techniques, investigated soil properties impacting on effluent disposal and researched alternative methods of on-site effluent treatment during the period 1976 - 1979. This included experimental work on evapotranspiration (ET) systems and the compilation of selected plants, shrubs and trees for planting within ET systems in the Northland and Auckland areas. This work has been directly applied to much of Queensland. An experimental Clivus Type domestic composting toilet was established in 1976 and monitored in Kerikeri, Northland, New Zealand. The design of associated greywater and disposal systems consequently took place in New Zealand and Queensland. The then Queensland Department of Primary Industries (Water Resources) identified the need to develop alternative wastewater treatment technologies in the early 1990 s. The writer set up an Artificial Wetlands Research and Advisory Committee to develop this technology within the range of climatic conditions in Queensland. This thesis focuses on the design rationale, nitrification and de-nitrification of effluent in reed/gravel beds or sub-surface wetlands. A postal survey of Australian effluent disposal systems was undertaken during the period 2000 - 2001. This showed that a broad range of disposal techniques were being used. A range of innovative (more non-conventional) treatment and disposal systems have been presented for use in Australasia. Raised sand mounds for effluent treatment have not been used on a wide spread basis in New Zealand and much of Australia. The performance of an existing sand mound, the design based on AS/NZS 1547 : 2000, located in Morayfield, Queensland has been assessed. A survey of deep shaft disposal was undertaken over much of the North Island of New Zealand over the period 1976 - 1977. This unique method of post-treatment and effluent disposal has merit in locations where shallow trenching is not appropriate and in deeper more permeable soils, that are clear of the groundwater. Experimental work on the use of lime and solar salt brines with seawater and magnesium salts, for treating municipal wastewater and a range of process waters was undertaken in New Zealand over the period 1984 - 1986. This work was extended as a joint research project with the Queensland University of Technology in the mid- 2000 s. This thesis reflects on past experimental and innovative work on on-site wastewater treatment and effluent disposal in Australasia and it recommends improvements and/or alternative technologies that can used to achieve higher standards of treatment. It consists of three chapters and eight portfolios covering separate topics. The connections between the chapters and the portfolios are shown in Figure 2 a of Chapter 2. The conclusions drawn from each portfolio are collated and summarized in Chapter 3. Copies of selected papers and technical reports are compiled in a separate Volume 2. ...|$|R

Perturbation of the <b>biological</b> pathways involving <b>DISC</b> 1 is known to lead to behavioral changes in rodents, which supports a clinical report of a Scottish pedigree in which the majority of family members with disruption of the DISC 1 gene manifest depression, schizophrenia, and related mental conditions.

Cultivation of rabbit AF cells with chondrogenic media significantly increased expressions of collagen and aggrecan. Upon exposure to osteogenic conditions, the cultures showed increased mineralization and expression of osteopontin, runx 2, and bmp 2 genes. Two models were used in the in vivo subcutaneous implantation experiments: 1) rabbit AF tissue in a demineralized bone matrix (DBM) cylinder (DBM/AF), and, 2) rat intact and needle punctured lumbar discs. Bone formation in the AF tissue was detected and hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteoblasts were present 1 month after implantation of the DBM/AF to nude mice.

Almost the entire needle punctured disc had ossified at 6 months.

To assess the efficacy of the regenerative approach, animal models of IVD degeneration are needed. Among these animal models, chemonucleolysis based on the enzymatic degradation of the Nucleus Pulposus (NP) is often used, but this technique remains far from the natural physiopathological process of IVD degeneration. Recently, we developed an innovative animal model of IVD degeneration based on the use of a laser beam. In the present study, this laser model was compared with the chemonucleolysis model in a longitudinal study in rabbits. The effects of the treatments were studied by MRI (T 2 -weighted signal intensity (T 2 wsi)), radiography (IVD height index), and histology (NP area and Boos’ scoring). The results showed that both treatments induced a degeneration of the IVD with a decrease in IVD height and T 2 wsi as well as NP area and an increase in Boos’ scoring. The enzyme treatment leads to a rapid and acute process of IVD degeneration. Conversely, laser radiation induced more progressive and less pronounced degeneration. It can be concluded that laser treatment provides an instrumental in vivo model of slowly evolving IVD degenerative disease that can be of preclinical relevance for assessing new prophylactic <b>biological</b> treatments of <b>disc</b> degeneration...|$|R
