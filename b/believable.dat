5|$|After {{producing}} several interactive games {{aimed at}} children, the Miller brothers {{decided to create}} an adult-targeted game with a non-linear story, <b>believable</b> characters, and an ethical dilemma. Initially turned down by Activision, Cyan was later approached by Sunsoft, who helped fund Myst. The game took two years to develop and was Cyan's largest project.|$|E
5|$|In the play, the Ilsa {{character}} is an American named Lois Meredith; {{she does not}} meet Laszlo until after her relationship with Rick in Paris has ended. Rick is a lawyer. To make Rick's motivation more <b>believable,</b> Wallis, Curtiz, and the screenwriters decided to set the film before the attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|James Van Hise and Hal Schuster {{wrote in}} their 1995 book, The Complete Next Generation, {{that they thought}} the {{relationship}} between Picard and Daren was <b>believable,</b> and that the story itself was very effective. They thought that the loneliness Picard feels {{at the end of}} the episode was part of an ongoing story which would culminate in the subplot about Picard's loneliness in Star Trek Generations.|$|E
5|$|The Allies had {{previously}} employed several deceptions against the region (for example Operation Hardboiled in 1942 and Operation Cockade in 1943). As a result, John Bevan, {{head of the}} London Controlling Section (LCS) and charged with overall organisation of Bodyguard, was concerned that visual/wireless deception {{would not be enough}} to create a <b>believable</b> threat.|$|E
5|$|The casting of {{low-profile}} actors aided {{in keeping}} the production budget low by avoiding the larger salaries attached to stars. To prepare for the role and create a <b>believable</b> friendship between the leads, Brown, Cooper, and Mann were sent to Disneyland together and spent a weekend in a cabin at Big Bear City, California.|$|E
5|$|The {{design and}} {{personality}} of Drake have drawn comparisons to other video game and film characters, such as Lara Croft and Indiana Jones. Many reviewers have called Drake a likable and <b>believable</b> character, and {{have noted that}} he is a rare example of a physically attractive character who is not hypermasculine.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} favorable reviews by critics. The Morning Telegraph {{said the}} story was too far-fetched to be <b>believable,</b> but {{it was done in}} an amusing way. The Moving Picture World stated that the acting and camerawork was satisfactory. The film was advertised in numerous states, sometimes as a comedy, by theaters in Indiana, Kansas, New York, and Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|After {{directing}} Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar {{had created}} <b>believable</b> simulations of underwater physics and {{was willing to}} direct a film set largely in space. WALL-E has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes consumerism, corporatism, nostalgia, waste management, human environmental impact and concerns, obesity, and global catastrophic risk. It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film titled Presto for its theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the voices were added, he could see the characters as <b>believable</b> people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Animal House {{was a great}} {{box office}} success despite its limited {{production}} costs and started an industry trend, inspiring other comedies such as Porky's, the Police Academy films, the American Pie films, Up the Academy (made by their rival magazine company: MAD), and Old School among others. Belushi became the most successful male comedy star in the world until his 1982 death; Bacon also became a star, and he, Matheson, and Allen are {{among those who have}} had lengthy acting careers. Reitman, Landis, and Ramis became successful filmmakers; Landis' use of dramatic actors and soundtrack to make the comedy <b>believable</b> became the traditional approach for film comedies.|$|E
5|$|As The World Ends with You {{focuses on}} the {{character}} of Neku Sakuraba, {{in order to create a}} <b>believable</b> story the developers put a lot of focus on his development, such as how he would feel, what thoughts lie behind his actions, how he interacted with other characters, and how the people around him feel about him. The developers included aspects and daily concerns, hoping that they could be things that players would have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist {{campaign}} was also generally praised. According to IGN's McCaffrey, the game's story {{is superior to}} those of its predecessors: well-balanced and <b>believable.</b> He criticized Sam Fisher's new voice actor, who he thought failed to replicate Ironside's charm. Ben Reeves praised the story's plot twists and sympathetic characters. On the Joystiq blog, Xav De Matos liked the game's narrative urgency and engaging plot twists but criticized its rushed ending. Simon Miller of VideoGamer.com called the game forgettable and boring, with Fisher's new voice actor failing to bring personality to the character. Eurogamer Bramwell also criticized the game's lack of character development.|$|E
5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and did not think it would be <b>believable</b> until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E
5|$|Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera {{thought the}} episode flowed well, {{and that the}} treknobabble was {{reasonable}} and logical, but that the episode didn't {{make good use of}} the characters. He said that each character fitted a certain role: Neelix was the jealous boyfriend, B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) was the shoot-first Klingon, and Kes was the perky-looking alien sounding board for other characters. Furthermore, Kutzera felt that the themes of the episode were more appropriate for an early first-season episode, not being as pertinent or <b>believable</b> a year later. He gave the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars.|$|E
5|$|During Oblivions development, Bethesda {{concentrated}} on creating {{a system with}} a more realistic storyline, <b>believable</b> characters, and meaningful quests than had {{been done in the}} past. In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks to the use of Bethesda proprietary Radiant A.I. software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivions terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles.|$|E
5|$|Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon's Jedi Padawan, {{who holds}} his master in high regard but {{questions}} his motives at times. McGregor was cast from a shortlist of fifty actors, {{all of whom}} had to be compared to pictures of young Alec Guinness, who portrayed the elderly Obi-Wan, to make a <b>believable</b> younger version. McGregor had a vocal coach to help his voice sound closer to Guinness'. He also studied several of Guinness' performances, from his early work and the Star Wars movies.|$|E
5|$|For {{the role}} of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose {{popularity}} was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for The Terminator. Cameron was dubious about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even bigger to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson were offered the Terminator role, but both turned it down. The studio suggested O. J. Simpson for the role, but Cameron {{did not feel that}} Simpson would be <b>believable</b> as a killer.|$|E
5|$|It's a touching, <b>believable,</b> often funny but {{ultimately}} sad tale {{of how one}} class {{can take advantage of}} another, even in the guise of patronizing benevolence. Though sometimes shifting abruptly in time, Vanaja is an arresting story of modern-day hardship and class exploitation, recalling Charles Dickens as well as Western fairy-tale lore. Domalpalli's settings are ultra-real in detail and color, from the crude, almost feudal deprivations of Vanaja's dirt-floor background to the stately rituals and autocratic entitlement of the well-to-do.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{cinematography}} {{was shot}} at night, because Bakshi felt that the daylight made the scenes less <b>believable.</b> Bakshi recounts that during {{the first day of}} shooting, the actors were unable to play their roles naturally, but began casually talking and acting the way he wanted their characters to act when the cameras were off, including flirting with an actress. However, the camera man was not around to capture these events, so Bakshi filmed them himself. When Bakshi excitedly told William A. Fraker about this, Fraker quit the production, and was replaced by a young cinematographer who had never worked in film before.|$|E
5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall out of his pocket so that it would not disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. It became more difficult for writers to develop <b>believable</b> scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{debate whether}} Macbeth's vision of Banquo is real or a {{hallucination}}. Macbeth {{had already seen}} a hallucination before murdering Duncan: a knife hovering in the air. Several performances of the play have even ignored the stage direction to have the Ghost of Banquo enter at all, heightening the sense that Macbeth is growing mad, since the audience cannot see what he claims to see. Scholars opposing this view claim that while the dagger is unusual, ghosts of murdered victims are more <b>believable,</b> having a basis in the audience's superstitions. Spirits in other Shakespeare plays—notably Hamlet and Midsummer Night's Dream—exist in ambiguous forms, occasionally even calling into question their own presence.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Parker {{reunited with}} Prince-Bythewood playing the male lead in her film Beyond the Lights. His {{performance}} {{was nominated for}} a 2015 Black Reel Award for Best Actor and an Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture. In Parker's role as a police officer moonlighting as a bodyguard, his onscreen chemistry with co-star Gugu Mbatha-Raw was praised by Dana Stevens of Slate. Stevens noted Parker was destined for more substantive performances. The story was hailed as a well-written <b>believable</b> romance with depth by many critcs such as Travers and Ebiri, earning an 82% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} were similarly well received. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com and Martin Robinson of Eurogamer called them <b>believable</b> and {{easy for the}} player to care about. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas was satisfied by development of each character, while Mike Manson of Nintendo Life considered each characters' motives to be unique and interesting. In contrast, Boosinger found the characters to be uncompelling and poorly written, and believed {{that there was little}} reason to care for them until their backstories were revealed.|$|E
5|$|A team at Naughty Dog {{designed}} the character appearances, and Amy Hennig {{was the main}} writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The voice actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, and also performed the motion capture work for their characters. Many of the characters were meant to highlight different aspects of Drake's personality. Reception to {{the characters in the}} series have been fairly positive, with most commentators focusing on the <b>believable</b> nature of the characters and their interactions with each other. The inclusion of strong female characters has also received praise, though one commentator pointed out that the women still fall into cliché roles. The voice acting has also received acclaim, including two Interactive Achievement Award nominations.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This {{is far more than}} in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more <b>believable</b> sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound, may often be the result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{pages were}} filmed per day, {{six days a}} week, with three shows {{completed}} per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed {{at a particular time}} with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed to bond with the dog and often groomed the dog at the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making the boy and dog scenes more <b>believable,</b> but, eventually the dog developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.|$|E
5|$|N. T. Rama Rao and Garikapati Varalakshmi {{were chosen}} {{as one of}} the leading pairs of actors. During the songs' shoot, Ghantasala taught Rama Rao to play {{harmonium}} and gave him a few music lessons so he would look <b>believable</b> in the film. Yandamuri Jogarao and Savitri, who had played minor roles in Shavukar and Pathala Bhairavi, were chosen as the other leading pair. In playing the role of the zamindar, S. V. Ranga Rao exhibited a strange body language, inspired by a stranger he had observed at a railway station. Dr. Sivarama Krishnayya and C.V.V. Panthulu played the role of Rama Rao's father in the Telugu and Tamil versions. Padmanabham played two roles; a postman and Ranga Rao's friend.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's {{greatest}} {{achievement was}} making India {{accessible to the}} outside world through his literature. He is {{regarded as one of the}} three leading English language Indian fiction writers, along with Raja Rao and Mulk Raj Anand. He gave his readers something to look forward to with Malgudi and its residents and is considered to be one of the best novelists India has ever produced. He brought small-town India to his audience in a manner that was both <b>believable</b> and experiential. Malgudi was not just a fictional town in India, but one teeming with characters, each with their own idiosyncrasies and attitudes, making the situation as familiar to the reader as if it were their own backyard. In 2014, Google commemorated Narayan's 108th birthday by featuring a doodle showing him behind a copy of Malgudi Days.|$|E
5|$|Reed's father, Charles Reed, was a {{successful}} London printer who later became a Member of Parliament (MP). Talbot attended the City of London School before leaving at 17 to join the family business in Fann Street. His literary career began in 1879, when the B.O.P. was launched. The family were staunchly Christian, pillars of the Congregational Church, and were heavily involved in charitable works. However, Reed did not use his writing {{as a vehicle for}} moralising, and was dismissive of those early school story writers who did, such as Dean Farrar. Reed's affinity with boys, his instinctive understanding of their standpoint in life and his gift for creating <b>believable</b> characters, ensured that his popularity survived through several generations. He was widely imitated by other writers in the school story genre.|$|E
5|$|Soraya {{is a young}} Afghan {{woman whom}} Amir meets and marries in the United States. Hosseini {{originally}} scripted the character as an American woman, but he later agreed to rewrite her as an Afghan immigrant after his editor did not find her background <b>believable</b> {{for her role in}} the story. The change contributed towards an extensive revision of Part III. In the final draft, Soraya lives with her parents, Afghan general Taheri and his wife, and wants to become an English teacher. Before meeting Amir, she ran away with an Afghan boyfriend in Virginia, which, according to Afghan tradition, made her unsuitable for marriage. Because Amir also had his own regrets, he loves and marries her anyway.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{positively}} reviewed by critics, but {{contained within the}} reviews were often criticism on {{the execution of the}} story and plot. A review in the The Moving Picture World was positive to the moral lesson the film asserted and found the acting to be satisfactory. Walton of the The Moving Picture News criticized the type of film as invoking sudden and unnatural changes in character {{for the sake of a}} moral lesson. The child's influence and ability to bring sense to her father was seen as cheap theatrics, but ended with the assertion that the film was not second rate for employing such theatrics. The New York Dramatic Mirror was positive, but said that the scene upon which the little girl follows her father was not <b>believable</b> because she was unaware of her father's intentions to kill himself. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Designs for {{the asylum}} {{departed}} from comic interpretations {{of a large}} mansion and instead developed an entire island, with hints of Alcatraz prison, composed of multiple buildings to allow for greater variety and exploration. Each building was designed with a different architectural style to make the facility appear <b>believable</b> and to imbue each location with a history. The medical building was inspired by Victorian architecture and its metalwork structure was intended to inspire feelings of horror. The intensive treatment unit has a Gothic, industrial aesthetic. The catacombs beneath the facility, inspired by early twentieth-century brickwork and Victorian industry, were meant to feel oppressive. The maximum security area was designed to feel claustrophobic and was retrofitted like a bunker, and the Arkham mansion displays a High Gothic style. The designers integrated crooked lines into environmental objects, such as trees and drainpipes, where possible. 40 rooms, 34 corridors, 3 exterior areas, and 3 Scarecrow-induced hallucination areas were designed for the game.|$|E
5|$|Evolves environments {{are based}} on Earth's as the design team {{wanted to create a}} world that felt <b>believable</b> for players and had regions that made {{geological}} sense after an early concept design was found to be too extreme. As a result, the design team drew inspiration from real-world landscapes. The design team wanted Evolve to be set in lush forests so that Hunters and Monsters could hide from each other. The design team tried using the Source game engine to create a forest landscape but they ultimately failed. The design team then researched Crytek's CryEngine, which powers games like Far Cry and Crysis. As the design team felt that Far Cry and Crysis set new standards for in-game environments, they decided to utilize CryEngine for Evolve. Evolves maps were designed to be dark and mysterious, so that the various characters can hide from each other, as well as presenting a sense of surprise when players are ambushed.|$|E
5|$|Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch, a {{linguist}} and cartographer at the Smithsonian who {{was recruited}} to decipher The Shepherd's Journal while directing {{an expedition to}} Atlantis. Kirk Wise, one of the directors, said that they chose Fox for the role because they felt he gave his character his own personality and made them more <b>believable</b> on screen. Fox said that voice acting was much easier than his past experience with live action {{because he did not}} have to worry about what he looked like in front of a camera while delivering his lines. The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for Titan A.E.; he allowed his son to choose which film he would work on, and he chose Atlantis. Viewers have noted similarities between Milo and the film's language consultant, Marc Okrand, who developed the Atlantean language used in the film. Okrand stated that Milo's supervising animator, John Pomeroy, sketched him, claiming not to know how a linguist looked or acted.|$|E
5|$|The film, under Hancock's {{direction}} and Tristan's writing, had originally a different tone and premise than what {{would eventually be}} seen in the final film. The two had envisioned Amity as a sort of ghost-town when the film opened with several businesses shuttered and the island's overall economy in ruins due to the events seen in the first film. The new resort and condos built on the island by developer Len Peterson were to help celebrate its rebirth giving the island's economy a much needed boost. Tristan had borrowed a subplot from the original Jaws novel and from a discarded early draft of the first film, in which Amity officials were in debt to the Mafia. Both Mayor Vaughn and Len Peterson were anxious for the new island resort to be a success not only to revive Amity but to pay back loans from the Mob that helped build it, thus leading to Vaughn's and Peterson's ignoring of Brody's warning. Tristan and Hancock felt this treatment would lead to more character development that would make the overall story that much more <b>believable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The realistic-looking {{effects of}} the astronauts {{floating}} weightless in space and inside the spacecraft were accomplished by suspending the actors from wires attached {{to the top of}} the set, and placing the camera underneath them. The actors' bodies blocked the camera's view of the suspension wires, creating a very <b>believable</b> appearance of floating. For the shot of Poole floating into the pod's arms during Bowman's rescue attempt, a stuntman replaced a dummy on the wire to realistically portray the movements of an unconscious human, and was shot in slow motion to enhance the illusion of drifting through space. The scene showing Bowman entering the emergency airlock from the E.V.A. pod was done in a similar way: an off-camera stagehand, standing on a platform, held the wire suspending Dullea above the camera positioned at the bottom of the vertically configured airlock. At the proper moment, the stagehand first loosened his grip on the wire, causing Dullea to fall toward the camera, then, while holding the wire firmly, he jumped off the platform, causing Dullea to ascend back up toward the hatch.|$|E
