Five test settings were chosen in urban, suburban, and rural areas in order to study propagation {{in a variety of}} environments. This paper reports the LOS measure-ments in different environments, all of which show variations of signal strength with distance that have distinct near and far regions separated by a break point. It was also found that the location of the break point for different frequencies and antenna heights can be calculated based on first Fresnel zone clearance. The regression analysis reveals a slope that is less than two before the break point, while it is greater than two after the break point.

40|$|Abstract — MANET {{is a type}} of {{temporary}} network in which the nodes are movable in nature. The infrastructural component is not used instead of that each node behaves as a router. Due to this dynamic updating topology, routing decisions have to be taken effectively. These routing decisions can also be affected by environmental factors like motion, traffic, power, delays etc. There are a variety of protocols which work on this routing dynamic behavior of the MANET. Out of these the AODV is the most used protocol which establishes the routes on demand. Initially a route request (RREQ) packet is broadcasted & in response to that route reply (RREP) is generated. During this route discovery the neighbor & intermediate nodes create a routing table & updates the entries for both sources & destination. Some factors lead the connection link to be failed or down. If this failure occurs between the data transfer, loss of data can occur. This work proposes a novel method & proves its improved performance & fault tolerant behavior. This link failure is handled either by source repair or by local repair depends on the link break point. It is a decision making problem in which the node does not know the triggering condition of starting those algorithms. Also when this link break occurs during the data exchange then loss of data occurs. So there must be a mechanism which is able to inform us prior the condition of link failure. This proposed Link <b>Break</b> <b>Distance</b> & Preemptive Threshold Alarm (LBD-PTA) mechanism is used for decision making based on previous information of data transfer. In this mechanism strength of links is regularly assessed for break point value according to its hop index. This hop index value is used for taking the decision about the repairing algorithms.

Physicochemical properties of the flour with differing particle sizes were investigated and utilized as raw material in rice noodle production; Sen Yai and Sen Mee. The protein content decreased whereas the ash content increased with decreasing particle size. The amylose content of each fraction was similar. Water absorption index (WAI) and water solubility index (WSI) were greater for fine flour. Fine flour also possessed high value of lightness (L*) and low yellowness (b*). Rapid visco analysis indicated that fine flour had lower gelatinization temperature while higher peak viscosity, breakdown and final viscosity than coarse flour. Thxtural characteristics of Sen Yai prepared from dry-milled rice flour were affected by particle sizes, flour slurry concentration, flour soaking and steaming time. Good qualities of Sen Yai were obtained from the finest flour (< 200 mesh) with 33 % flour concentration, 3 hrs soaking and 5 min steaming. Increasing in soaking time and steaming time improved the noodle qualities. A process for production of Sen Mee from dry-milled rice flour comprised a) mixing rice flour with 35 - 40 % pregelatinise flour, added some water then kneaded to obtain a dough b) extruding the dough to form the noodle c) steaming the noodles d) drying the noodle at 45 - 48 °C to a moisture content below 12 % by weight.

Especially, {{we are interested in}} Reinforce-ment Learning methods, where the training signal is only given in terms of success or failure. Our final goal is a learning system, where we only plug in ’win the match ’ – and our agents learn to generate the appropri-ate behaviour. This paper focuses on the application of Reinforcement Learning in the field of soccer simulation. 1 Design Principles The 3 D team is based on the following principles: – Two main modules: world module and decision making module – Linear and nonlinear regression models are used to approximate future world states – Input to the decision module is the approximate, complete world state – The soccer environment is modelled as an Markovian Decision Process (MDP) – Decision making is organized in complex and less complex behaviours – A steadily growing part of the behaviours is learned by Reinforcement Learning methods – Modern AI methods are applied wherever possible and useful The different skills are layered corresponding to their complexity as shown in Figure 1. The idea behind this architecture is to divide the team tactic into subtasks that can be solved more easily (divide and conquer). To avoid complicated nested switch or if statements, we created different classes for each type of player (the top box in Figure 1). The different players use the same medium level skills like GoalShot or Intersect. These depend on the low level skills like GoToPos. Whenever we {{can come up with a}} simple analytical algorithm, we use it. Reinforcement Learning methods are used in the remaining cases.

The spacecraft has strict magnetic cleanliness requirements that demand deviation from standard testing, analysis and data correction practices. We present advances made towards the detection of magnetometer zero offsets and the verification of unit magnetic field emissions {{in anticipation of the}} Solar Orbiter mission. We demonstrate an improvement to the detection of magnetometer zero offsets through the automatic calculation of a key parameter vital to the removal of the spacecraft field from measured data. The existing technique uses pre-existing rotations in the solar wind to calculate the magnetometer zero offsets. Our improvement uses the measured solar wind data to automatically calculate the important minimum compressional standard deviation (MCS) parameter, demonstrating an improvement in the offset calculation probability of up to 10 % at aphelion and 5 % at perihelion. We also suggest an improvement to the extrapolation of source emission measurements made close to equipment under test (EUT), in order to verify field emissions against strict magnetic cleanliness requirements. We propose the use of magnetic field scaling that follows an inverse square law close to the EUT and an inverse cube law beyond a chosen <b>break</b> <b>distance</b> 3 times the scale size of the EUT.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the causes of}} avalanche danger at a regional scale. Modelled snow stratigraphy variables were linked to [1] forecasted avalanche danger and [2] observed snowpack stability. Spatial variability of snowpack parameters in a region is an additional important factor that influences the avalanche danger. Snow depth and its change during individual snow fall periods are snowpack parameters which can be measured at a high spatial resolution. Hence, the spatial distribution of snow depth and snow depth change due to individual snow storms were observed [3]. Furthermore, this spatial dataset was characterised with a fractal analysis and results were related to deposition processes [4]. In the following, each subject is described in more detail: [1] In the past, numerical prediction of regional avalanche danger using statistical methods with meteorological input variables has shown insufficiently accurate results, possibly {{due to the lack}} of snow stratigraphy data. Detailed snow-cover data were rarely used because they were not readily available (manual observations). With the development and increasing use of snow-cover models this deficiency can now be rectified and model output can be used as input for forecasting models. We used the output of the physically based snow cover model SNOWPACK combined with meteorological variables to investigate and establish a link to regional avalanche danger. Snow stratigraphy was simulated for the location of an automatic weather station near Davos (Switzerland) over nine winters. Only dry-snow situations were considered. A variety of selection algorithms was used to identify the most important simulated snow variables. Data mining and statistical methods, including classification trees, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, hidden Markov Models and nearest-neighbour methods were trained on the forecasted regional avalanche danger (European avalanche danger scale). The best results were achieved with a nearest neighbour method which used the avalanche danger level of the previous day as additional input. A cross-validated accuracy (hit rate) of 73 % was obtained. This study suggests that modelled snow-stratigraphy variables, as provided by SNOWPACK, are able to improve numerical avalanche forecasting. [2] Snow stability, or the probability of avalanche release, is one of the key factors defining avalanche danger. Most snow stability evaluations are based on field observations, which are time-consuming and sometimes dangerous. Through numerical modelling of the snow cover stratigraphy, the problem of having sparsely measured regional stability information can be overcome. In this study we compared numerical model output with observed stability. Overall, 775 snow profiles combined with Rutschblock scores and release types for the area surrounding five weather stations were rated into three stability classes. Snow stratigraphy data were then produced for the locations of these five weather stations using the snow cover model SNOWPACK. We observed that (i) an existing physically based stability interpretation implemented in SNOWPACK was applicable for regional stability evaluation; (ii) modelled variables equivalent to those manually observed variables found to be significantly discriminatory with regard to stability, did not demonstrated equal strength of classification; (iii) additional modelled variables that cannot be measured in the field discriminated well between stability categories. Finally, with objective feature selection, a set of variables was chosen to establish an optimal link between the modelled snow stratigraphy data and the stability rating through the use of classification trees. Cross-validation was then used to assess the quality of the classification trees. A true skill statistic of 0. 5 and 0. 4 was achieved by two models that detected "rather stable" or "rather unstable" conditions, respectively. The interpretation derived could be further developed into a support tool for avalanche warning services for the prediction of regional avalanche danger. [3] Terrestrial and Airborne Laser Scanning (TLS and ALS) techniques have only recently developed to the point where they allow wide-area measurements of snow distribution in varying terrain. Multiple TLS measurements are presented showing the snow depth development for a series of precipitation events. We observe that the pattern of maximum accumulation is similar for the two years presented here (correlation up to r= 0. 97). Storms arriving from the Northwest show persistent snow depth distributions and contribute most to the final accumulation pattern. Snow depth patterns of maximum accumulation for the two years is more similar than the distribution created by any two pairs of individual storms. A decrease in variance of snow depth change with time was observed, while variance of snow depth was increasing. Based on the strong link between accumulation patterns and terrain, we investigated the ability of a model based on terrain and wind direction to predict accumulation patterns. This approach of Winstral, which describes wind exposure and shelter, was able to predict the general accumulation pattern over scales of slopes but failed to match observed variance. Furthermore, a high sensitivity to the local wind direction was demonstrated. We suggest that Winstral's model could form a useful tool for application from hydrology and avalanche risk assessment to glaciology. [4] We present analysis of high resolution laser scanning data of snow depths in the Wannengrat catchment (introduced in [3]) using omni-directional and directional variograms for three specific terrain features; cross-loaded slopes, lee slopes and windward slopes. A break in scaling behavior was observed in all sub-areas, which can be seen as the roughness scale of summer terrain which is modified by the snow cover. In the wind-protected lee slope a different scaling behavior was observed, compared to the two wind-exposed areas. The wind-exposed areas have a smaller ordinal intercept, a smaller short range fractal dimension D and a larger scale <b>break</b> <b>distance</b> L than the wind-protected lee slope. Snow depth structure inherits characteristics of dominant NW storms, which results e. g. in a trend towards larger break distances in the course of the accumulation season. This can be interpreted as a result of surface smoothing at increasing scales. Similar scaling characteristics were obtained for two different years at the end of the accumulation season. Since snow depth structure is altered strongly by NW storms, this inter-annual consistency may strongly depend on their frequency in an accumulation period. The analysis of directional variograms suggests that existing anisotropies can be explained by the orientation of terrain features with respect to the predominant wind direction...|$|E

This study examines the temporal consistency of snow depth scaling features at two sites using snow depth distributions derived from lidar datasets collected in 2003 and 2005.

Two distinct fractal regions are observed in each log–log variogram, separated by a scale break, which indicates a length scale at which a substantial change in the driving processes exists. The lag distance of the scale break is 15 m at the Walton Creek site and 40 m at the Alpine site. The datasets show consistent fractal dimensions and scale <b>break</b> <b>distances</b> between the two years, suggesting that the scaling features observed in spatial snow depth distributions are largely determined by physiography and vegeta-tion characteristics and are relatively insensitive to annual variations in snowfall.
