500|$|John Anderson, of Variety, said [...] "to simply call it {{harrowing}} or unsparing doesn’t quite cut it," [...] having {{felt that}} the film is [...] "courageous and uncompromising, a shaken cocktail of debasement and elation, despair and hope." [...] Anderson cited Carey's performance as [...] "pitch perfect" [...] and Patton's role as Ms. Blu Rain as [...] "disarming." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, praised Carey's performance, describing it as having been [...] "an authentically deglammed compassion" [...] and praised the film for 'capturing' [...] "how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead" [...] and for Daniels' showing [...] "unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives." [...] Gleiberman described the film as being a movie [...] "that makes you think, 'There <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>of</b> God go I.' [...] It's a potent and moving experience, because by the end you feel you've witnessed {{nothing less than the}} birth of a soul" [...] and {{felt that the}} [...] "final scene of revelation" [...] between Sidibe's and Mo'Nique's characters was strong {{enough to be able to}} leave viewers [...] "tearful, shaken, [...] dazed with pity and terror." [...] He identifies how Daniels uses one of the rich scenes created by Fletcher to position Mo'Nique in a painful confrontation with Sidibe that results in a masterful and thought-provoking performance that delivers the final [...] "push" [...] needed by Sidibe: [...] "The more Precious tries to get away from her mother, the more she's pulled back".|$|E
500|$|... "Born This Way" [...] {{was written}} by Gaga and Jeppe Laursen (formerly of the band Junior Senior), and {{produced}} with Paul Blair (a.k.a. DJ White Shadow) and Fernando Garibay, while it was mixed at Abbey Road Studios in London and Germano Studios in New York. The electropop song begins with Gaga's voice uttering the line [...] "It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M" [...] on a loop, backed by a rumbling synth sound and a humming bass. As the synths change into a beat, Gaga belts out the song's first verse, followed by the bass dropping off and the percussion-backed chorus, [...] "I'm beautiful in my way, 'cause God makes no mistakes; I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way", which Jocelyn Vena from MTV likened as being [...] "meant {{to be heard in}} a big space. It's fast and hard-hitting." [...] After the chorus she chants the line [...] "Don't be a drag, Just be a queen" [...] a number of times on top of handclaps, before moving to the second verse. After the second chorus an interlude follows, where Gaga chants the names of various communities. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that the interlude is a mixture of the music from American television show, Glee, and the song [...] "There <b>But</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grace</b> <b>of</b> God Go I" [...] by Machine. The music fades out for a moment as Gaga sings a cappella, before the addition of an organ and Gaga closes the song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Born This Way" [...] is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate dance beat tempo of 124 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major as Gaga's voice spans the tonal nodes of F3 to C5. [...] "Born This Way" [...] follows a chord progression of F5–F–E–B–F in the chorus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began as}} soon as the report was presented to that House of Commons. It is reported that Thatcher read the main conclusions of the report to cries of [...] "whitewash" [...] and ironic cheers from the opposition. In the parliamentary debate that followed its publication, the former Prime Minister James Callaghan said that [...] "for 338 paragraphs he painted a splendid picture, delineated the light and the shade, and the glowing colours in it, and when Franks got to paragraph 339 he got fed up with the canvas he was painting, and chucked a bucket of whitewash over it". David Owen, Foreign Secretary in the previous Labour government, was kinder in his interpretation. He said in Parliament that [...] "I do not agree with substantial parts of the Franks report, but anyone who pretends that the issue in 1982 was easy simply has not lived through such experience", and [...] "when I read the Franks report, I think 'There <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>of</b> God go I'".|$|E

They showed little reaction … I suppose it reminded them not just that they had been rather sneaky in the handling of Pete Best's sacking, never telling him to his face, <b>but</b> that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of God, or Brian Epstein, circumstances might have been different and they could have ended up [...]" [...] During the height of Beatlemania Best attempted to commit suicide, but his mother, Mona, and his brother, Rory, talked him out of it.|$|R

On 18 April 1623 Villiers was ennobled as Earl of Anglesey and Baron Villiers of Daventry. This {{had been in}} <b>the</b> air <b>for</b> more than a year, with the king seeking to persuade Villiers {{to give up a}} mistress, but in the event he had failed to do so. On 19 April, John Chamberlain wrote to Sir Dudley Carleton: [...] <b>But,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> more <b>grace</b> to <b>the</b> Lord of Buckingham in his absence, his brother, Kit Villiers, is presently to be made Baron of Daventry and Earl of Anglesey, with the endowment of £100 land, old rent, and the gift of a forest, which is to be sold or enclosed; so that his lady and cousin is like to be a worthy countess.|$|R
2500|$|Later in {{the early}} 13th century, the O’Donnell also gave succor to the Ó Cléirigh kings of Uí Fiachrach Aidhne. Onara Ultach was descended of the MacDonlevy (dynasty) royals of Ulidia (kingdom), who as above noted {{after the fall of}} that Ulster kingdom to the Anglo-Norman forces of Henry Plantagenet served as ollam lieghis or the {{official}} physicians to the O'Donnell kings of Tyrconnell. [...] Onara married Donnchadh Ó Cléirigh, a son of the Chief of the name of the Ó Cléirigh family then also of Tyconnell. The Ó Cléirigh were too a learned Irish royal family that had lost their sub-kingdom in Uí Fiachrach Aidhne in what is today County Galway to the Anglo-Norman forces of Henry Plantagenet. The Ó Cléirigh then went into service of the O’Donnell as poet historians, scribes and secretaries or official bards, called in Irish language [...] "ollam righ". Onara bore for Donnchadh a son Mícheál Ó Cléirigh (c. 1590 – 1643), anglicized Michael O’Cleary, who matured to become the principal author of the Annals of <b>the</b> Four Masters. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> manifold <b>grace</b> of <b>the</b> O’Donnell, this union would never have occurred, and Michael O’Cleary never lived to memorialize this history of Gaelic Ireland.|$|R

60|$|I {{walked slowly}} back {{reflecting}} on this conversation, upon the motives impelling Mr. Jason to become thus confidential; {{nor was it}} the most comforting thought {{in the world that}} the artist in me had appealed to the artist in him, that he had hailed me as a breather. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>of</b> God I might have been Mr. Jason and he Mr. Paret: undoubtedly that was what he had meant to imply... And I was forced to admit that he had succeeded--deliberately or not--in making the respectable Mr. Paret just a trifle uncomfortable.|$|E
6000|$|I pride {{myself on}} not {{being one of}} these susceptible: If you study the {{electric}} light with which I supply you in that Bumbledonian public capacity of mine over which you make merry from time to time, {{you will find that}} your house contains a great quantity of highly susceptible copper wire which gorges itself with electricity and gives you no light whatever. But here and there occurs a scrap of intensely insusceptible, intensely resistant material; and that stubborn scrap grapples with the current and will not let it through until it has made itself useful to you as those two vital qualities of literature, light and heat. Now if I am to be no mere copper wire amateur but a luminous author, I must also be a most intensely refractory person, liable to go out and to go wrong at inconvenient moments, and with incendiary possibilities. These are the faults of my qualities; and I assure you that I sometimes dislike myself so much that when some irritable reviewer chances at that moment to pitch into me with zest, I feel unspeakably relieved and obliged. But I never dream of reforming, knowing that I must take myself as I am and get what work I can out of myself. All this you will understand; for there is community of material between us: we are both critics of life as well as of art; and you have perhaps said to yourself when I have passed your windows, [...] "There, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>of</b> God, go I."

6000|$|... 'And yet {{it may be}} I am unjust to Bismarck,' said Karenin, {{following}} his own thoughts. 'You see, men belong to their own age; we stand upon a common stock of thought and we fancy we stand upon the ground. I met a pleasant man the other day, a Maori, whose great-grandfather was a cannibal. It chanced he had a daguerreotype of the old sinner, and the two were marvellously alike. One felt that a little juggling with time and either {{might have been the}} other. People are cruel and stupid in a stupid age who might be gentle and splendid in a gracious one. The world also has its moods. Think of the mental food of Bismarck's childhood; the humiliations of Napoleon's victories, the crowded, crowning victory of the Battle of the Nations.... Everybody in those days, wise or foolish, believed that the division of the world under a multitude of governments was inevitable, and that it was going on for thousands of years more. It WAS inevitable until it was impossible. Any one who had denied that inevitability publicly would have been counted--oh! a SILLY fellow. Old Bismarck was only just a little--forcible, on the lines of the accepted ideas. That is all. He thought that since there had to be national governments he would make one that was strong at home and invincible abroad. Because he had fed with a kind of rough appetite upon what we can see now were very stupid ideas, that does not make him a stupid man. We've had advantages; we've had unity and collectivism blasted into our brains. Where should we be now <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>of</b> science? I should have been an embittered, spiteful, downtrodden member of the Russian Intelligenza, a conspirator, a prisoner, or an assassin. You, my dear, would have been breaking dingy windows as a suffragette.' ...|$|E
6000|$|We must {{wake up to}} {{the fact}} that we shouldn't get Utopia by turning out Mr. Jason and the highly {{efficient}} gentlemen who hired and financed him. It wasn't so simple as that. Utopia was not an achievement after all, but an undertaking, a state of mind, the continued overcoming of resistance by a progressive education and effort. And all this talk of political and financial [...] "wickedness" [...] was rubbish; the wickedness they complained of did not reside merely in individuals it was a social disorder, or rather an order that no longer suited social conditions. If the so-called good citizens would take the trouble to educate themselves, to think instead of allowing their thinking to be done for them they would see that the [...] "evils" [...] which had been published broadcast were merely the symptoms of that disease which had come upon the social body through their collective neglect and indifference. They held up their hands in horror at the spectacle of a commercial, licensed prostitution, they shunned the prostitute and the criminal; but there was none of us, if honest, who would not exclaim when he saw them, [...] "there, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grace</b> <b>of</b> God, go I!" [...] What we still called [...] "sin" [...] was largely the result of lack of opportunity, and the active principle of society as at present organized tended more and more to restrict opportunity. Lack of opportunity, lack of proper nutrition,--these made sinners by the wholesale; made, too, nine-tenths of the inefficient of whom we self-righteously complained. We had a national philosophy that measured prosperity in dollars and cents, included in this measurement the profits of liquor dealers who were responsible for most of our idiots. So long as we set our hearts on that kind of prosperity, so long as we failed to grasp the simple and practical fact that the greatest assets of a nation are healthy and sane and educated, clear-thinking human beings, just so long was prostitution logical, Riverside Franchises, traction deals, Judd Jasons, and the respectable gentlemen who continued to fill their coffers out of the public purse inevitable.|$|E
6000|$|Anthropology {{has been}} {{compared}} to a great region, marked out indeed as within the sphere of influence of science, but unsettled {{and for the most part}} unsubdued. Like all such hinterland sciences, it is a happy hunting-ground for adventurers. Just as in the early days of British Somaliland, rascals would descend from nowhere in particular upon unfortunate villages, levy taxes and administer atrocity in the name of the Empire, and even, I am told, outface for a time the modest heralds of the government, so in this department of anthropology the public mind suffers from the imposition of theories and assertions claiming to be [...] "scientific," [...] which have no more relation to that organized system of criticism which is science, than a brigand at large on a mountain has to the machinery of law and police, by which finally he will be hanged. Among such raiding theorists none at present are in quite such urgent need of polemical suppression as those who would persuade the heedless general reader that every social failure is necessarily a [...] "degenerate," [...] and who claim boldly that they can trace a distinctly evil and mischievous strain in that unfortunate miscellany which constitutes [...] "the criminal class." [...] They invoke the name of [...] "science" [...] with just as much confidence and just as much claim as the early Victorian phrenologists. They speak and write with ineffable profundity about the [...] "criminal" [...] ear, the [...] "criminal" [...] thumb, the [...] "criminal" [...] glance. They gain access to gaols and pester unfortunate prisoners with callipers and cameras, and quite unforgivable prying into personal and private matters, and they hold out great hopes that by these expedients they will evolve at last a [...] "scientific" [...] revival of the Kaffir's witch- smelling. We shall catch our criminals by anthropometry ere ever a criminal thought has entered their brains. [...] "Prevention is better than cure." [...] These mattoid scientists make a direct and disastrous attack upon the latent self-respect of criminals. And not only upon that tender plant, but also upon the springs of human charity towards the criminal class. For the complex and varied chapter of accidents that carries men into that net of precautions, expedients, prohibitions, and vindictive reprisals, the net of the law, they would have us believe there is a fatal necessity inherent in their being. Criminals are born, not made, they allege. No longer are we to say, [...] "There, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>of</b> God, go I"--when the convict tramps past us--but, [...] "There goes another sort of animal that is differentiating from my species and which I would gladly see exterminated." ...|$|E
