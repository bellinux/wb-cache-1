40|$|Abstract. We propose simple {{transformation}} of the hidden states in variational <b>Bayesian</b> (VB) factor <b>analysis</b> models {{to speed up the}} learning procedure. The transformation basically performs centering and whitening of the hidden states taking into account the posterior uncertainties. The transformation is given a theoretical justification from optimisation of the VB cost function. We derive the transformation formulae for variational <b>Bayesian</b> principal component <b>analysis</b> and show experimentally that it can significantly improve the rate of convergence.

500|$|Two {{radiocarbon}} datings to {{find the}} age of the bones suggested dates of 1430–60 and 1412–49—both too early for Richard's death in 1485. Mass spectrometry carried out on the bones found evidence of much seafood consumption, which is known to make radiocarbon dating samples appear older than they are. [...] A <b>Bayesian</b> <b>analysis</b> suggested there was a 68.2% probability that the true date of the bones was between 1475 and 1530, rising to 95.4% for between 1450 and 1540. Although by itself not enough to prove that the skeleton was Richard's, it was consistent with the date of his death. The mass spectrometry result indicating the rich seafood diet was confirmed by a chemical isotope analysis of two teeth, a femur and a rib. From the isotope analysis of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in the teeth and bones the researchers discovered the diet included much freshwater fish and exotic birds such as swan, crane and heron, and a vast quantity of wine— all items at {{the high end of the}} luxury market. Close analysis of the soil immediately below the skeleton revealed that the man had been infested with roundworm parasites when he died.|$|E
