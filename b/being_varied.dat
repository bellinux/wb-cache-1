Blue jays can also copy the cries of local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult to tell which it is. Their voice is typical of most jays in <b>being</b> <b>varied,</b> but the most commonly recognized sound is the alarm call, which is a loud, almost gull-like scream. There is also a high-pitched jayer-jayer call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more agitated. This particular call can be easily confused with the chickadee's song because of the slow starting chick-ah-dee-ee. Blue jays will use these calls to band together to mob potential predators such as hawks and drive {{them away from the}} jays' nests.|$|E

The chess-board, we also say, is in the same place it was, if it remain in the same part of the cabin, though perhaps the ship which it is in sails all the while. And the ship is said {{to be in the same}} place, supposing it kept the same distance with the parts of the neighbouring land; though perhaps the earth hath turned round, and so both chess-men, and board, and ship, have every one changed place, in respect of remoter bodies, which have kept the same distance one with another. But yet the distance from certain parts of the board being that which determines the place of the chess-men; and the distance from the fixed parts of the cabin (with which we made the comparison) being that which determined the place of the chess-board; and the fixed parts of the earth that by which we determined the place of the ship,--these things may be said to be in the same place in those respects: though their distance from some other things, which in this matter we did not consider, <b>being</b> <b>varied,</b> they have undoubtedly changed place in that respect; and we ourselves shall think so, when we have occasion to compare them with those other.|$|E

5000|$|In Buddhism, sentient {{beings are}} beings with consciousness, sentience, {{or in some}} {{contexts}} life itself. Sentient beings are composed of the five aggregates, or skandhas: matter, sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness. In the Samyutta Nikaya, the Buddha is recorded as saying that [...] "just as the word 'chariot' exists {{on the basis of}} the aggregation of parts, even so the concept of 'being' exists when the five aggregates are available." [...] While distinctions in usage and potential subdivisions or classes of sentient <b>beings</b> <b>vary</b> from one school, teacher, or thinker to another, it principally refers to beings in contrast with buddhahood. That is, sentient beings are characteristically not enlightened, and are thus confined to the death, rebirth, and dukkha (suffering) characteristic of saṃsāra.|$|R

50|$|Elasticity can be {{quantified}} as {{the ratio of the}} percentage change in one variable to the percentage change in another variable, when the latter variable has a causal influence on the former.

2500|$|Some {{defenders}} of Warren-style arguments grant that these problems {{have not yet}} been fully solved, but reply that the [...] "natural capacities" [...] view fares no better. [...] It is argued, for example, that as human <b>beings</b> <b>vary</b> significantly in their natural cognitive capacities (some are naturally more intelligent than others), and as one can imagine a series or spectrum of species with gradually diminishing natural capacities (for example, a series from humans down to amoebae with only the slightest differences in natural capacities between each successive species), therefore the problems of arbitrariness and inequality will apply equally to the [...] "natural capacities" [...] view.

5000|$|The {{variation}} principle {{describes the}} process of altering, embellishing, and modifying of melodic, rhythmic, harmonic, and/or other parts of a musical structure.

In African music these variations are often improvised. Variation in African music are abundant and the musicians view them as necessary. Simha Arom states, [...] "All musical pieces are characterized by cyclic structure that generates numerous improvised variations: repetition and variation {{is one of the most}} fundamental principles of all Central African musics,as indeed of many other musics in Black Africa." [...] He continues, [...] "Finally, improvisation, which I have described as the driving force behind melodic and rhythmic variations, plays an important part in every group. But there is no such thing as free improvisation, that is, improvisation that does not refer back to some precise and identifiable piece of music. It is always subordinate to the musical structure in which it appears..." ...|$|E
50|$|This {{movement}} is the apotheosis of Hindemith's mastery of classical forms. It functions {{both as an}} unusual set of variations, as its name suggests, and as a full-fledged Sonata-Allegro movement. As indicated by the continuation of variations numbers from the previous movement, the theme <b>being</b> <b>varied</b> is the one from that movement, which functions as the second theme in Sonata-Allegro terminology. The first theme, introduced immediately {{at the beginning of}} the movement, is the very distinctive figure of a turn followed by an ascending scale. This figure is played and elaborated on by the soloist, with the pianist providing tonicizing changes of harmony at each instance of the turn figure. The viola then transforms this figure into the beginning of a more lyrical theme, which brings the music down in tempo and dynamic level. The main theme returns momentarily, only to falter and give way to a new quiet theme which is a continuance of the rhythmic developments made by the first softer section. This theme, quick downward steps followed by a gentle Mannheim rocket and another set of descending steps, may easily be mistaken for a second theme, when in fact it is an extension and transformation of the movement's opening gesture.|$|E
5000|$|The {{specially}} designed new starter areas met a mixed reception from critics. On the one hand, they were felt {{to give a}} strong new perspective to existing players or a solid introduction to the game to new players. The arrangement of quests and content in these areas was felt to be more finely tuned than for existing races, with players unlikely to face grinding in order to progress and an interesting backstory being gradually revealed. It was felt that Blizzard had learned from {{the release of the}} original game, with the new content <b>being</b> <b>varied</b> without becoming overwhelming to new players, and new concepts being gradually introduced. On the other hand, reviewers felt that the new starter areas were poorly integrated with the existing world, leaving them feeling [...] "tacked on." [...] They were also disappointed that the new areas had a definite finish, beyond which a player would have to switch back to older content in order to progress their character. This progression didn't feel as smooth to reviewers when compared to the movement between zones for new characters from the older starting areas. The experience was also felt to be short-lived, with players being able to progress through these new areas with a couple of days' play without any new introductory dungeons to explore. It was also felt that these changes didn't address existing problems, such as the travel time between quest locations.|$|E
