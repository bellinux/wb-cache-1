5000|$|Allen {{was born}} in Illinois in 1882 to a Mr. and Mrs (née Davis) Allen. From there he headed west to California, working as a hotelier. During his time as a hotelier, Allen came across a chemist or pharmacist, while doing {{business}} in Arizona. He had told Allen that he had allegedly perfected a mix for root beer. Intrigued by the prospect, Allen eventually purchased that recipe. He then opened a stand to sell it at Lodi, California in June 1919, originally charging 5¢. The first mugs of the drinks were sold to returning soldiers from the First World War. During that era, prohibition had helped the sale of soft drinks across the United States, and Allen found success in his root beer stand. The drink gained the name [...] "A&W Root Beer" [...] in 1922 when an employee of Allen's stand in Stockton, Frank Wright, joined Allen in a partnership. The following year, A&W opened its first drive-in restaurant, located in Sacramento. Though Frank Wright was bought out another year later, the chain of root beer stands retained the same name. In 1925, with restaurants already in California, Texas and Utah, Allen set out to expand and franchise the chain, becoming the first franchise of drive-in restaurants in the United States, with just under 200 locations in the Western and Midwestern United States by 1930. To ensure a consistent product across franchises, Allen used a system where the top-secret root <b>beer</b> <b>concentrate</b> was sold to each franchise owner. By 1941, there were around 260 stands across the United States, though World War II created problems for Allen's chain due to shortages in product and employees, with multiple franchises going out of business. However, as the war came to an end, the chain went on to expand once again.|$|E
40|$|History of Znojmo's brewery (1363 - 2010) - {{abstract}} The {{content of}} this Bachelor Degree Thesis is the complete history and building {{development of the}} only remaining Znojmo brewery {{in the period of}} 1720 to 2010, a brewery that is no longer operating. At the same time, this thesis describes the history of brewing in Znojmo begining from the first sings in the 13 th century (emphasising 1363 which was a legendary year for Znojmo's brewing) till 2010 when the last brewery in Znojmo was completely closed and the tradition of brewing in Znojmo lasting for almost 700 years was interrupted. The following chapters describe for example the origin of the name "Hostan", the present name of Znojmo's <b>beer,</b> <b>concentrating</b> to all products, once produced in Znojmo brewery, and awards that once famously delicious Znojmo's beer Hostan received all round the Czech Republic. The thesis completely summarizes all the years of Beer Festival - a modern tradition that arose thanks to the existence of brewery and ceased, when the brewery was closed. Everything is accompanied with period photographs, copies of old documents, portraits of important celebrities, graphs indicating beer production in Znojmo in the course of time, exterior and interior photographs of all buildings, etc. This Bachelor Degree Thesis is the first completely [...] ...|$|R

The foam is traditionally sliced off with a knife, known as ‘beheading’. This removes the larger bubbles, which tend to cause the head to deteriorate faster, protecting the liquid underneath from exposure to the air and maintaining the head’s bitter aromas.|$|R
50|$|The Landlords were {{an early}} {{hardcore}} punk band from Charlottesville, Virginia, United States. The band, consisting of four {{students from the}} University of Virginia, was formed at around October 1983. A month after the Landlords formed, the band began to break off {{into a number of}} other bands which included the Happy Flowers When <b>Beers</b> and Kramer <b>concentrated</b> on their Happy Flowers work, Landlords bassist Eddie Jetlag continued his association with them by writing sleevenotes for their releases. The Landlords continued for a few years after Happy Flowers started.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, {{while on}} hiatus from INXS, he joined Absent Friends as bass guitarist.

40|$|The {{markets and}} {{industrial}} utilization of agricultural commodities have undergone considerable {{change in the}} last few decades. In Zambia, sorghum was considered a traditional crop with limited industrial uses. Research and transformations in consumer tastes and preferences have {{led to the development of}} new uses for sorghum. Potential markets for industrial utilization of sorghum have been identified as food processing, <b>beer</b> brewing, feed <b>concentrates</b> and energy production. One of the success stories in industrial utilization of sorghum has been Eagle, a sorghum based clear beer produced by Zambian breweries. The study reported in this paper aims to examine the main linkages in Eagle lager value added supply chain. Conclusion and recommendations: Zambian breweries should invest more in improving the image of Eagle Lager. Zambian breweries should follow up on pricing and beer strength complaints expressed by consumers...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the only}} {{retailer}} of strong alcoholic beverages in Finland, Alko has an extensive {{range of products}} ranging from rare wines to bulk vodka. Its wine selection has grown in recent decades as {{there has been an}} increase in consumption and a government drive to change Finnish drinking habits to a more [...] "European" [...] style, which means a move from hard liquor to wine and beer. While wine consumption has increased, this has not replaced consumption of other alcoholic beverages, negating the [...] "Europeanisation" [...] argument. Nowadays wines occupy most of the shelf space in an Alko shop. Its <b>beer</b> selection is <b>concentrated</b> on stronger versions of the domestic bulk lagers and some high-quality strong beers from major beer-producing countries as well as traditional Sahti at some locations. Hard spirits include several Finnish brands of vodka and all major types of hard liquor. Alko also sells brands of drinks produced by the Finnish state-owned company Altia, which are traditional products and not sold abroad. Many of these date back to the first products launched after the end of prohibition in Finland. These are usually for mixing drinks.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research project is to study the impact of an innovative wort production method on flavour quality and flavour stability of lager beer. The innovation comprises 1) thick and fast mashing under anti-oxidative conditions to save time and energy; 2) high mashing-off temperature (95 &# 176;C) compared to conventional mashing-off temperature of 78 &# 176;C; 3) acidified sparging; and 4) in-line wort stripping with culinary steam and in-kettle stripping during filling of the kettle (till kettle is full) for continuously stripping of unwanted volatiles. After wort filtration and in-line stripping, no additional boiling is required. Special {{attention was paid to}} mashing-in conditions (O 2, pH, temperature), in order to prevent early oxidation. During transfer of the mash to the mash vessel, the malt aldehydes are to be stripped off as much as possible. Clean steam injectors in combination with over-sized chimneys and condensate traps and high mashing-off temperatures should facilitate the release and stripping of unwanted volatile aldehydes. Mashing-off at temperatures above 95 &# 176;C has three aims: 1. strip off unwanted volatile aldehydes; 2. partially degrade of SMM to DMS (flavour of Brussels sprouts); 3. coagulate and flocculate high molecular weight proteins. The holding time of the elevated mashing-off temperature will depend on these three items. The fastest and thickest mashing conditions were first evaluated to produce concentrated mashes in the shortest time frame. A thick mash results in smaller total volumes so that low water and reduced energy input is required during mashing. An efficient sparging will then lead to lowest volumes for boiling with highest extract content which is again beneficial in view of energy consumption and brewhouse capacity. Fine milling in combination with thinbed wort filtration resulted in highly comparable wort, beer, and ageing profiles compared to conventional coarse milling/lautertun operations. High mashing-off temperature resulted in a fast wort filtration, bright sweet wort and a low heat load (based on the TB-Index). Due to the high mashing-off and wort filtration temperature, SMM is already transformed into free DMS which evaporates partially at mashing-off. Sufficient conversion of SMM and removal of DMS is possible by in-line and in-kettle clean steam injection during filling of the combination vessel. Sparging with acidified water at high temperature minimised the extraction of extra proanthocyanidins during the sparging step ending up with comparable amounts compared to conventional wort production. High mashing-off temperature also resulted in decreased levels of haze sensitive proteins, in comparison with conventional mashing-off temperature. The use of steam to form and strip DMS however results in the formation of a low trub content, but the small protein flocks are difficult to remove. No striking differences have been found when comparing conventionally produced beers with the innovative beers. However, important differences have been observed when the beers were subjected to ageing. Due to the acidified sparging, high aldehyde contents have been found in the pitching wort upon innovative wort production. The low pH of sparging liquor seems to result in an enhanced release of imine-bound aldehydes. As apparent from analysis of pitching wort, these free aldehydes have not been efficiently stripped off (in contrast to DMS), but after fermentation, comparable levels of free aldehydes were found in the fresh beers. However, during ageing of the innovative beer, lower levels of aldehydes were found resulting in significantly lower overall ageing sensory scores. The release of aldehydes during acidified sparging, even at conventional sparge temperatures of 78 &# 176;C, is also malt dependent. In conclusion, the innovative wort production, executed in less than 3. 5 hours, results in a highly comparable fresh beer, but with an extended flavour stability compared to conventional <b>beer</b> production. <b>Concentrated</b> mashes and highest extract content due to low sparge rates will result in a decreased need of energy for wort production. The high throughput of the two vessel brewhouse with a thinbed filter will also reduce the investment cost.
