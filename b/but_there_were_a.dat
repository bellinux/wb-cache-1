The first ten were built without smoke deflectors, {{but these were}} added from August 1931, and the remaining thirty were fitted with them from new. Following the successful introduction of the Lemaître multiple jet blastpipes on to the Lord Nelson class, Maunsell's successor Oliver Bulleid began to fit them to the Schools class. However no discernible improvement to draughting was experienced, and only twenty examples were so modified, the most obvious change in their appearance being the large diameter chimney.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, {{due to a}} {{shrinking}} number of operational units and stepped up production, equipment shortages were {{a thing of the}} past. Indeed, the Army had more equipment that it actually needed. For example, a total of 368 25pounders were required for combat and 38 for training <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> total of 1,516 on hand. Additionally, a total of 530 2pounder and 6pounder anti-tank guns were required, but the Army had 1,941, while 68 3.7inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training, but there were 640 pieces available. Similar surpluses existed with small arms such as the Bren, of which 9,438 were required, but there were 21,139 in the system. The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required, due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare.|$|E
5|$|Lismore {{was part}} of the kingdom of Dalriada in the 6th century and {{probably}} thereafter until the arrival of the Vikings in the late 8th century, after which it is likely the island was absorbed into the Norse-Gael Kingdom of the Isles. Magnus Barelegs had established direct Norwegian overlordship over this sprawling sea kingdom by 1098. In that year, Edgar of Scotland signed a treaty with Magnus which settled much of the boundary between the Scots and Norwegian claims in these islands. Edgar formally acknowledged the existing situation by giving up his claims to the Hebrides <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> few exceptions including Luing and Lismore, which were retained by the Scots.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} Scottish landscape painting {{are in the}} tradition of Scottish house decoration for burgesses, lairds and lords, that arose after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, partly {{as a response to the}} loss of religious patronage. Most were of heraldry, classical myths and allegory, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> number of painted landscape scenes. These included the landscapes of four seasons in the Skelmorlie Aisle (1638) in the memorial chapel of the Montgomery family in Largs undertaken by James Stalker (fl. 1632–38). They indicate an awareness of contemporaneous Dutch landscape painting. The Flemish artist Alexander Keirincx (1600–52) was active in England and Scotland where he undertook commissions for Charles I, mainly of royal castles in Northern England and Scotland. These included one showing Seton House (1636–37) in its landscape, which is often said to be the earliest surviving painted landscape created in Scotland. The theme of house decoration with landscapes was taken up in the eighteenth century by James Norie (1684–1757), who worked beside the architect William Adam (1689–1748). Norie, with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with capriccios or pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes, bringing to Scotland the influence of French artists such as Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. The Nories were also important figures in professionalisation of Scottish art and the development of art education.|$|E

25|$|The Regia Marina had six battleships {{with which}} to contend {{for control of the}} Mediterranean, the four most modern of which were being re-fit at the {{outbreak}} of the war. In addition to the six capital ships, the Italians had 19 cruisers, 59 destroyers, 67 torpedo boats, and 116 submarines. Though the Regia Marina had a number of fast new cruisers with good range in their gunnery, the older classes were lightly built and had inadequate defensive armor. Numerically the Italian fleet was formidable, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> large number of older vessels, and the service suffered in general from insufficient time at sea for crew training.|$|E
25|$|Philip IV, who {{had seen}} {{over the course of}} his life the declining {{influence}} of Spain's empire, sank slowly into depression after he had to dismiss his favorite courtier, Olivares, in 1643. In 1646, his eldest son and heir Don Baltasar Carlos died at the age of 16. Charles was manipulated by various political factions throughout his life. For a short time under Don Juan José de Austria as valido the nobility came to dominate Spain once again. Most were self-serving, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> few such as the Count of Oropesa, who managed (despite ruinous deflation) to stabilize the currency.

25|$|Climate is a {{key factor}} that has been studied in the colony {{productivity}} of P. snelleni. Since there is always one founding queen in a P. snelleni nest, the denominator of colony productivity is always one. Productivity was found to vary drastically {{with a couple of}} very large nests that were found in Kanto, Japan. These nests had hundreds of cells in comparison to the usually 100 cells. In these nests, there was a female-biased sex ratio, which lines up with the resource availability hypothesis. This hypothesis states that colonies with better resources should be more heavily female based. The numbers of first brood workers in these nests were not greater than other nests, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> lot more females, so the sex ratio was heavily female.|$|E

25|$|In January 1678, {{a palace}} coup broke {{out against the}} queen-regent, and John {{established}} himself as prime minister. Mariana was driven from Madrid, and Valenzuela was exiled. By the Treaties of Nijmegen (1678), which brought to an end the Franco-Dutch War (1672–78), Spain ceded to France the Imperial County of Burgundy (Franche-Comté), and further territories of the Spanish Netherlands, including the town of Saint-Omer with the remaining northwestern part of the former Imperial County of Artois, the lands of Cassel, Aire and Ypres in southwestern Flanders, the Bishopric of Cambrai, {{as well as the}} towns of Valenciennes and Maubeuge in the southern County of Hainaut. Great hopes were entertained for his administration, but it proved disappointing and short. Most nobles were incompetent and self-serving, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> few good men such as the Count of Oropesa, who managed (despite ruinous deflation) to stabilize the currency.

25|$|The flying replicas were {{specifically}} {{chosen to}} be different enough that an ordinary audience member could distinguish them. They were all types reputed to have flown well, in or about 1910. In most cases this worked well, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> few surprises, adding to an accurate historical reassessment of the aircraft concerned. For example, in its early form, the replica of the Santos-Dumont Demoiselle, a forerunner of today's ultralight aircraft, was unable to leave the ground except in short hops. Extending the wingspan and fitting a more powerful Ardem 50hp engine produced only marginal improvement. When Doug Bianchi and the Personal Planes production staff who constructed the replica consulted with Allen Wheeler, he recalled that the Demoiselle's designer and first pilot, Alberto Santos-Dumont was a very short, slightly built man. A suitably small pilot, Joan Hughes, a wartime member of the Air Transport Auxiliary who was the Airways Flying Club chief instructor, was hired. With the reduced payload, the diminutive Demoiselle flew very well, and Hughes proved a consummate stunt flyer, able to undertake exacting manoeuvres.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{plans for}} building this canal were in late 1830s. The Treaty of Adrianopol (September 14, 1829) canceled the trade monopoly of the Ottoman Empire in the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, allowing these countries {{to build their}} own fleets by 1834. Both Romanian and non-Romanian ships used mostly the Danube port cities of Brăila and Galați, which saw an economic boom. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> number of barriers to this trade: the Ottomans controlled the navigation regime on the Danube, while the Russian Empire – the access to the Black Sea in the Danube Delta, and there was little the Danubian Principalities could do to rectify this situation. Both countries welcomed the Austrian Empire's 1834 decision, endorsed by Count István Széchenyi, to extend the route of the first pyroscaphe navigation company to the maritime Danube. The Austrian initiative was received unpleasantly by the Russians, who considered their trade through Odessa and ports in the Crimea threatened by the development of Brăila and Galați. Without resolving to direct measures, Russians, who controlled the Sulina branch, started to show rigidity, instituting on February 7, 1836 a compulsory quarantine on the island of Letea, collecting taxes to cover Russian financial deficit, and by not performing maintenance for the navigation on the Sulina branch to remove the continuous deposits of sand.|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} this period that the Mongols arrived in the Near East. Their {{presence}} further east had already displaced the Khwarazmians, and embassies had been sent by various popes as well as Louis IX to ally or negotiate with them, but they were uninterested in alliances. They sacked Baghdad in 1258, and Aleppo and Damascus in 1260, destroying both the Abbasid caliphate and {{the last vestiges of}} the Ayyubid dynasty. Hethum I of Armenia and Bohemond VI of Antioch had already submitted to the Mongols as vassals. Some of the Mongols were Nestorian Christians, including Kitbuqa, one of the generals at the sieges of Baghdad and Damascus, but despite this, the nobles of Acre refused to submit. As the kingdom was by now a relatively unimportant state, the Mongols paid little attention to it, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> few skirmishes in 1260: the forces of Julian of Sidon killed the nephew of Kitbuqa, who responded by sacking Sidon, and John II of Beirut was also captured by the Mongols during another raid. The apparently inevitable Mongol conquest was stalled when Hulagu, the Mongol commander in Syria, returned home {{after the death of his}} brother Möngke Khan, leaving Kitbuqa with a small garrison. The Mamluks of Egypt then sought, and were granted, permission to advance through Frankish territory, and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut in September 1260. Kitbuqa was killed and all of Syria fell under Mamluk control. On the way back to Egypt, the Mamluk sultan Qutuz was assassinated by the general Baibars, who was far less favourable than his predecessor to alliances with the Franks.|$|E
