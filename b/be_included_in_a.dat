For decades, there has been significant disagreement between traditionalists and innovators regarding which ingredients should and should not <b>be</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> salade niçoise. According to traditionalists, it excludes cooked vegetables. The salad may include raw red peppers, shallots, artichoke hearts and other seasonal raw vegetables. Raw green beans harvested in the spring, when they are still young and crisp, may be included. However, cooked green beans and potatoes are commonly served in variations of salade niçoise that are popular around the world.|$|E
