40|$|In this paper, we analyze an {{endogenous}} {{determination of}} efforts put into information acquisition {{and its impact}} on supply chain management. More specifically, we consider a supplier who sells a product to a buyer during a single selling season. Prior to placing an order with the supplier, the buyer has an option to acquire additional information about the demand by hiring experts (who are capable of providing forecasts). Because a commission fee must be paid to each hired expert, there exists a tradeoff between the cost and the value of the information, and the buyer needs to determine how much information to acquire. We derive the optimal information-acquisition level in an integrated setting and compare it with that determined in a decentralized setting. We also analyze several types of supply contracts to examine if they can coordinate the supply chain and allow an arbitrary division of system profit between the supplier and the <b>buyer.</b> <b>Information</b> acquisition Inventory Supply chain management...|$|E

40|$|We use {{the metaphor}} of the mutual {{assurance}} game to develop the notion that overseas suppliers may proactively manage uncertainty by making customized investments to serve their buyers. Using this game-theoretic conceptualization as a complement to the transactions cost analysis notion of credible commitments, we argue that such investments serve as assurances of commitment to the international buyer. The hypotheses are tested using data collected in a survey of U. S. purchasing managers regarding their relationships with their Pacific Rim suppliers. Consistent with our hypotheses, our primary results indicate that suppliers' relationship-specific investments are greater when technological uncertainty is high and buyers value supplier responsiveness. Further, our results suggest that relationship stability and <b>buyer</b> <b>information</b> sharing are greater when supplier relationship-specific investments are greater. These results provide some support for our argument that in the face of technological uncertainty, overseas suppliers may unilaterally commit to their buyers in attempts to obtain reciprocal benefits that help them manage external uncertainty. © 1999 JIBS.

40|$|When buyers possess little {{information}} about product characteristics, markets contract {{and the quality}} supplied by sellers is driven down. These effects are mitigated, sometimes eliminated, when grading and certification procedures are implemented. A significant literature explores the channels through which these procedures influence quality, the size of markets and, overall welfare. 1 The first channel is entry and exit. Grading raises the number of high quality firms {{at the expense of}} low quality producers and, in so doing it increases the share of high quality output. 2 The second channel operates through changes in the product specification. The standard finding is that sellers raise quality as buyers become more discerning about product characteristics. This paper is also concerned with the relationship <b>buyer</b> <b>information</b> and the quality supplied by sellers. It addresses two questions: (1) How do changes in the cost of grading affect the quality choices made by individual firms and, how do these changes influence the average quality produced by the industry as a whole; (2) how do changes in the cost of production affect individual grading decisions, how do they influence the quality composition of outpu...|$|E
40|$|Competition law in many {{countries}} prohibits firms from making false claims about product quality or performance to potential buyers and also requires that the truth of specific claims be supported by adequate prior testing. This paper explores the differences between these two policies and asks, among other questions, whether a policy of mandatory prior substantiation has any incremental effect if a ban on false claims is in place. This paper develops a model in which firms have private information about their probability of having a high quality product {{and are able to}} determine product quality with certainty through costly learning. Penalties for false claims and for unsubstantiated claims create an opportunity for firms to credibly reveal their information and for signaling to emerge in equilibrium. I show that the two kinds of penalties affect the possibility of signaling in different ways, and that the mandatory substantiation requirement in many circumstances improves <b>buyer</b> <b>information</b> and social welfare beyond what is achieved by a ban on false claims alone. It is therefore not redundant to a false claims ban, but is a useful additional policy tool in markets characterized by asymmetric information...|$|E

In fact, when the stakes are large, loss-aversion can eliminate trade altogether.

40|$|Dynamics in {{the global}} food system along with a cascade of {{technologies}} drive demands for capturing information and sharing information vertically within the supply chain. Food safety, genetic engineering, and animal welfare all {{have contributed to the}} need for enhanced information flow within the supply chain.

Components of this vertical information situation include farmer-supplier identity preservation to capture value and the <b>buyer</b> <b>information</b> needs concerning geographic location of production or seller identity in order to manage risk.

It reviews previous empirical evidence for the propositions and discusses the mixed support provided for the theory.

Finally, the article discusses the implications of the results for both economies and marketing.

Stigler's model has been revised (Rothschild 1974; Salop and Stiglitz 1977; Wilde and Schwartz 1979), but its basic thrust is still intact. His primary contribution lies in recognizing that not all buyers will be perfectly informed about marketplace alternatives because individual buyers place different values on the costs of and returns from search.

40|$|We {{consider}} sealed- and open-bid total-cost procurement auctions {{where two}} attributes {{are used for}} contract award decisions: price, which is bid by the supplier, and a fixed cost adjustment, which is included by the buyer to capture nonprice factors such as logistics costs. Suppliers know only their own true production cost and their own cost adjustment, and the buyer does not know the suppliers' true production costs but does know all suppliers' cost adjustments, which she herself sets {{in order to make}} an informed total-cost decision. The buyer, who seeks to minimize her total (price and cost adjustment) procurement cost, can choose to run a first-price sealed-bid auction, where suppliers' bids are affected by their beliefs about each other's total costs, or a descending open-bid auction, where only the actual realizations of suppliers' total costs drive the auction outcome. We characterize the buyer's choice between the two formats as a threshold decision over suppliers' cost adjustments and analyze the effect of supplier beliefs on her decision. We also study the impact of additional suppliers on the buyer's decision, the effect of correlation between suppliers' production costs and their cost adjustments, and additive as well as multiplicative total-cost functions. The results suggest that procurement managers can use their evaluations of suppliers' cost adjustments to make better auction format decisions. procurement auctions, informed <b>buyer,</b> <b>information</b> disclosure...|$|E

40|$|We study a {{bilateral}} trading relationship {{in which one}} agent, the seller, can make a non–recoverable investment in order to generate potential gains from trade. Afterwards, the seller makes a price offer that the buyer can either accept or reject. Economic theory predicts that if agents are selfish, neither the level of investment cost nor the <b>buyer’s</b> <b>information</b> about costs should affect the outcome. However, if agents are fairminded, sellers who are known by the buyer to have high investment costs are predicted to charge higher prices. If the investment cost is private information, low–cost sellers should price more aggressively and high–cost sellers price less aggressively than under complete information, giving rise to disagreement and/or underinvestment. Our experiments support these predictions. In particular, many low–cost sellers exploit the informational asymmetry by pretending to be fairminded when they are not: They offer the price that yields an even split of the net surplus for a high–cost seller.
