5|$|In 1622, several parishioners of Boxgrove, near Chichester in west Sussex, were {{prosecuted for}} playing cricket in a churchyard on Sunday, 5 May. There were three {{reasons for the}} prosecution: one was that it contravened a local bye-law; another {{reflected}} concern about church windows {{which may or may}} not have been broken; the third was that a little childe had like to have her braines beaten out with a cricket <b>batt!</b> The latter reason was because the rules at the time allowed the batsman to hit the ball twice and so fielding near the batsman was very hazardous, as the incidents involving Jasper Vinall and Henry Brand were to drastically confirm.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: There is a {{need for}} {{materials}} and battings which provide fire resistant properties and are lightweight, washable, and aesthetically accep-table. Thermal properties of <b>batts</b> constructed from a new carbonaceous fiber were evaluated to determine its usefulness in military and commercial applica-tions for thermal and fire protection. Carbonaceous <b>batts</b> were compared to <b>batts</b> available in commercial and military products on thermal transmittance (conductance and resistance) and thermal protective performance. Results indicated that experimental <b>batts</b> could be constructed to provide insulation comparable to available products. Thermal protective performance tests indicated that the carbonaceous <b>batts</b> provided flame protection superior to current military and commercial products...|$|R
