40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with business angels’ investments process and which aspects in their choice of target firms are considered important in that process. The problem statement of this thesis is; what aspects {{play a role in}} Business angels’ investment decision, and in what way? How do these aspects affect <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> when making investment decisions, and why? The aim subsequently {{is concerned with}} discerning what is most important for <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> when choosing their target firms and how <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> make their investment decisions. We also aim to be able to create a deeper understanding of <b>business</b> <b>angels,</b> and contribute to small entrepreneurial firms in their search for financiers. Our research can provide information on how entrepreneurs can attract <b>business</b> <b>angels.</b> The study is created with previous studies as a framework, and a wide selection of studies have been used. These have been examined and issues which in those studies {{have been found to be}} important for <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> have been reviewed and accounted for in the theory chapter. The approach we used for data collection was through qualitative interviews with the use of an interview guide. This is explained by our aspiration to understand business angels’ investment criteria rather than describe them. Due to this, the view of interpretivism along with constructionism was taken on when constructing the interviews and findings. The respondents were found through <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> networks, and the selection of <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> entailed a fair representation of the researched group. This thesis has been conducted in an academically correct manner, and the results are validated and confirmed by the respondents. The results we came to from our interviews were that the entrepreneur was most important for <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> in their evaluations, but other aspects also played a role. We analyzed our results with the use of our theory section and hence could see that some things we had come up with were unique, whilst some findings confirmed previous studies. We found that many <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> turn down investments due to their lack of time, which was a rather new emphasize for this study. Some qualities of the entrepreneur the <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> required were that they needed to be sales oriented and not overly optimistic about the future returns and prosperity of their ventures. We have shown that if entrepreneurs are overly optimistic about the value of their own firm it is likely that they will lose the deal. This was also of interest as it has not been stated as clearly in previous studies. We conclude the thesis by giving advice to entrepreneurs and <b>business</b> <b>angels,</b> what future <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> should keep in mind and also what entrepreneurs should know before they involve themselves with <b>business</b> <b>angels...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{exploration}} of informal venture capital {{the authors of the}} work frequently came across with various definitions of such terms as informal investors and <b>business</b> <b>angels.</b> This research showed that various investigators, organizations and associations have different interpretation of the above-mentioned terms and, accordingly, use them differently. The analysis carried out during this work allows one to confirm that, in process of data collection on the number of informal investors and <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> and its processing, a distortion of data describing the number of <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> takes place in some cases. The problem is that, even if the procedure is correct but the inquiry-making quality is poor, a significant distortion of data is possible. In the authors’ opinion, some mistakes in detection of the number of <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> can occur due to different understanding and usage of definition of <b>business</b> <b>angels,</b> and incorrect methods and organization of numeric data collection...|$|R

40|$|Today {{there are}} a number of {{different}} financing options but few of them are suitable for start-up companies. <b>Business</b> <b>angels</b> are in that case an exception and a suitable investor in these companies. <b>Business</b> <b>angels</b> are individuals who invest in young companies and differ from other financiers in the sense that the collaboration with the company is closer. <b>Business</b> <b>angels</b> are although few in numbers while the young companies often tend to be in most need of funding and has the greatest potential to grow. The purpose of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the cooperation between entrepreneurs and <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> and to identify which effects the financial gap have on these financial associations. <b>Business</b> <b>angels</b> and entrepreneurs collaboration are hard to interpret and therefore demanded a deeper examination. We thus used a qualitative method consisting of six different interviews in three different cases. The study shows that established collaborations between entrepreneurs and <b>business</b> <b>angel’s</b> seem to be affected by the financial gap to a great extent, which has been expressed in negative consequences. The financial gaps effects on the cooperation mainly takes form in the initial assessment process where the contractors expressed difficulties in the search of funders due too the limited number of stakeholders. We have identified communication problems and grievances between the entrepreneurs and <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> in the form of wills and we see these problems as a result of the initial problem...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} business angels’ behaviours towards {{agency costs}} by studying how <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> reduce conflicts of interests with entrepreneurs. The theoretical framework {{of this paper}} is based on the agency theory and the incomplete contract theory. In order to make this study more accurate, corporate governance mechanisms were also used to decipher and understand business angels’ behaviours. Using these theories, the research framework is based on four different areas of interest: contracts and the different rights these involve, informal and formal involvement of <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> in investments, the relationship between the entrepreneurs and the <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> and finally corporate governance mechanisms. This paper is based an analysis of the results of 5 interviews and a questionnaire that was sent to 78 British and French <b>business</b> <b>angels.</b> From these the impact of different factors on the agency costs was determined. The findings show that the business angels’ involvement, the trustworthy relationship between the <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> and the entrepreneurs and certain corporate governance mechanisms can successfully mitigate against agency costs. On the contrary, analysis results showed that using extensive control and monitoring rights or appointing non-executive directors onto the boards increased agency costs. Thus, this paper answers how <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> can mitigate agency costs with entrepreneurs...|$|R

40|$|A {{major focus}} of {{research}} on <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> has examined their decision-making processes and investment criteria. As <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> reject most of the opportunities that they receive, this article explores the reasons informing such decisions. In view of angel heterogeneity, investment opportunities {{might be expected to}} be rejected for differing reasons. Two sources of data are used to examine this issue. Face-to-face interviews with 30 <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> in Scotland and Northern Ireland provided information on typical ‘deal killers’ This was complemented by an internet survey of UK that attracted responses from 238 UK <b>business</b> <b>angels.</b> The findings confirm that the main reason for rejection relates to the entrepreneur/management team. However, angel characteristics do not explain the number of reasons given for opportunity rejection nor do they predict the reasons for rejecting investment opportunities. This could be related to the increasing trend for <b>business</b> <b>angels</b> to join organized groups which, in turn, leads {{to the development of a}} shared repertoire of investment approaches. We suggest the concept of ‘communities-of-practice’ as an explanation for this finding...|$|R
