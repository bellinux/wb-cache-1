5|$|Kant {{believed}} that morality is the objective law of reason: just as objective physical laws necessitate physical actions (apples fall {{down because of}} gravity, for example), objective rational laws necessitate rational actions. He thus {{believed that}} a perfectly rational being must also be perfectly moral because a perfectly rational being subjectively finds it necessary {{to do what is}} rationally necessary. Because humans are not perfectly rational (they partly act <b>by</b> <b>instinct),</b> Kant believed that humans must conform their subjective will with objective rational laws, which he called conformity obligation. Kant argued that the objective law of reason is a priori, existing externally from rational being. Just as physical laws exist prior to physical beings, rational laws (morality) exist prior to rational beings. Therefore, according to Kant, rational morality is universal and cannot change depending on circumstance.|$|E
25|$|Early acts {{of violent}} {{resistance}} were often motivated more <b>by</b> <b>instinct</b> and fighting spirit than by any formal ideology, but later several distinct political alignments and visions of post-liberation France developed among the Résistance organisations. These differences sometimes resulted in conflicts, but {{the differences among}} Résistance factions were usually papered over by their shared opposition to Vichy and the Germans; and over time, the various elements of the Résistance began to unite.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} debate {{on whether or}} not certain breeds of dogs are inherently more prone to commit attacks causing serious injury (i.e., so driven <b>by</b> <b>instinct</b> and breeding that, under certain circumstances, they are exceedingly likely to attempt or commit dangerous attacks). Regardless of the breed of the dog, it is recognized that the risk of dangerous dog attacks can be greatly increased by human actions (such as neglect or fight training) or inactions (as carelessness in confinement and control).|$|E

Sheltering in the stable in Bethlehem, it witnesses the birth of Jesus, the shepherds, the three wise men and the visitation of an angel. Inspecting the presents left by the three wise men for something to eat, the baby Jesus touches the donkey's ear and its character is transformed. It becomes the donkey that takes Joseph, Mary and Jesus into Egypt, once knowing <b>by</b> <b>instinct</b> when Herod's soldiers are near and hiding them.|$|E
25|$|Stein {{was first}} {{appointed}} manager of Scotland on a part-time {{basis in the}} spring of 1965, taking charge of their attempt to qualify for the 1966 World Cup. Scotland achieved good results in their first two qualifiers, a draw against Poland and a win against Finland. Stein was criticised by the Scottish press after the team conceded two late goals and lost 2–1 at home to Poland, but they managed to beat Italy 1–0 at Hampden Park through a last minute goal by John Greig to raise some hope of qualification. Scotland suffered from several players withdrawing from the return match against Italy due to injury. Stein, <b>by</b> <b>instinct</b> an attacking coach, set his team up defensively. A 3–0 defeat meant that they failed to qualify from UEFA Group 8. Stein relinquished the Scotland job after this defeat to concentrate on his full-time role with Celtic.|$|E

5000|$|Homo duplex {{is a view}} {{promulgated by}} Émile Durkheim, a macro-sociologist of the 19th century, saying that {{a man on the}} one hand is a {{biological}} organism, driven <b>by</b> <b>instincts,</b> with desire and appetite {{and on the other hand}} is being led by morality and other elements generated by society.

500|$|McCartney {{was largely}} a self-taught musician, and his {{approach}} was described by musicologist Ian MacDonald as [...] "by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored... produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely <b>by</b> <b>instinct,</b> his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ... natural melodist—a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony". McCartney commented, [...] "I prefer to think of my approach to music as... rather like the primitive cave artists, who drew without training." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Roberts {{had largely}} escaped {{criticism}} for his previous work, his novel Red Fox attracted attention from Burroughs {{and his allies}} after its publication in 1906. The work contains stories relating to a single animal, the eponymous Red Fox who was described by the author as [...] "fairly typical, both in his characteristics and in the experiences that befall him, {{in spite of the}} fact that he is stronger and cleverer than the average run of foxes." [...] Burroughs' critique of the book began by expressing his admiration for Roberts' [...] "genius", but again stressed his belief that animals were governed <b>by</b> <b>instinct,</b> rather than instruction or intuition. He pointed to particular passages, such as when the fox escaped a group of hounds by running across the backs of sheep on a field, as disingenuous and misleading.|$|E
500|$|Constantine's batting {{was based}} on good eyesight, quick {{reflexes}} and natural ability. He used his wrists to adjust {{the angle of the}} bat at the last second, allowing him to counter unexpected late movement of the ball. He batted <b>by</b> <b>instinct</b> and, according to Manley, [...] "his every stroke [...] more to energy than calculation". He was capable of scoring rapidly against any standard of bowling, but rarely survived for long periods because he chose not to defend. His best shots were the cut, pull and hook. Critics believed that Constantine's batting reached its peak once he became an accomplished league cricketer. By setting himself to master the variety of pitch conditions he encountered, and adopting a style of fast-scoring and occasionally unorthodox batting, he became an adaptable and effective batsman in all forms of cricket, improvising where necessary to prevent bowlers getting on top.|$|E

500|$|Also in 1908, Jack London {{broke his}} silence on his {{condemnation}} during the controversy by publishing {{an essay in}} Collier's Weekly entitled [...] "The Other Animals". Directly addressing Roosevelt's past criticism of his novels, London called the President [...] "homocentric" [...] and [...] "amateur". He further wrote: [...] "I have been guilty of writing two animal—two books about dogs. The writing of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which {{it seemed to me}} several 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not think these things; he merely did them,' etc. And I did this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; and I did it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but <b>by</b> <b>instinct,</b> sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers." ...|$|E

He also proposed a target to double the number of Lib Dem MPs within two elections, and before the 2008 local elections confirmed that he was pleased with their performance in the polls.|$|E
2500|$|That {{is such a}} {{difficult}} question. There are times when certain people are blessed—and cursed—with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. Callas {{was one of these}} people. It was as if her own wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us things about music that we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that is why singers admire her so. I think that's why conductors admire her so. I know it's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand." [...] She couldn't really explain what she did. It was all done <b>by</b> <b>instinct.</b> It was something embedded deep within her.|$|E
