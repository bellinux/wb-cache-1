In this study, both <b>biomasses</b> were assessed before and after acid pretreatment and following hydrolysis with Nasutitermes aquilinus and Cortaritermes fulviceps termite gut digestome. The chemical composition analysis of the <b>biomasses</b> after diluted acid pretreatment showed that the hemicellulose fraction was par-tially removed.

These organic compounds, also known as prebiotics, promote the growth of intestinal probiotic microorganisms thus improving the hosts&# 039; overall immune system. This work aimed at designing a thermochemical pretreatment of <b>biomasses</b> leading to production of high prebiotic yields and assessing the liquor quality based on resultant oligomer-monomer constituents. Four <b>biomasses,</b> namely Miscanthus sinensis, Panicum virgatum, Calamagrostis acutiflora and Bagasse, each having a dry weight xylan content of = 20 % were used. Identification and quantification using HPLC and ion chromatography systems showed xylooligomer yields of 65. 0 %, 84. 2 %, 87. 9 % and 92. 3 %, respectively.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} of <b>biomasses</b> originates different products, {{the most}} abundant of which are methane and carbon dioxide. During this process, a 60 - 70 % organic matter reduction occurs and the final product, the digestate, is charac- terized by high biological stability and high contents of recalcitrant organic molecules and nutrients. In the present work digestates obtained by different mixture of <b>biomasses</b> in a full-scale co-digestion plant operating in Italy were characterized as whole samples without any pre-treatment or extraction by means of Fourier transform infrared spec- troscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy in the synchronous-scan mode and results were compared to those obtained on the single fresh substrates. <b>Biomasses</b> considered were: beef cattle slurry, maize or sorghum silage, agro-industrial residues, olive residues and olive mill wastewater. These substrates exhibited typical spectra related to their different chemical composition. Results obtained on digestates provided evidence of distinctive characteristic of the final product {{as a function of}} the different composition of the <b>biomasses</b> loaded into the digestion plant. We concluded that FTIR and fluorescence spectra of digestates produced in a real co-digestion plant “inherit” the main spectroscopic features of the organic wastes from which they are produced.

40|$|Our goal is {{the study}} of {{interactions}} between sea ice and ocean and of their influence on planktonic communities. We use a physical model which includes explicitly melting dynamics and mixed-layer physics. A one-dimensional model of the water column with a k-l turbulent closure is applied. The sea-ice model is the one proposed by Semtner (1976); we add a parameterization of leads. We enlighten the importance, in this kind of model, of the sharing of the energy between lateral and basal meltings. The biological model comprises two state variables: phytoplankton and zooplankton <b>biomasses.</b> Melting induces a persistent shallow mixed layer and thus appropriate conditions for primary production. If ice melting is present, high <b>biomasses</b> are possible even with high losses. The absence of ice nearly forbids a massive bloom to form. Some sensitivity studies have shown that grazing pressure is a key factor governing the evolution of <b>biomasses.</b> The <b>biomasses</b> are also sensitive to little modifications of the photosynthetic production.

40|$|The {{detergent}} {{fiber and}} the insoluble dietary fiber methods {{were compared to}} quantitate lignin in commelinid and non-commelinid magnoliophyta <b>biomasses.</b> This comparison {{was based on the}} precision of these methods and on the correlation between these methods. The present study showed that the insoluble dietary fiber method was more reliable to quantitate lignin because of its higher precision and smaller bias, as compared to the detergent fiber method. Nevertheless, the less tedious and resource consuming detergent fiber method can reliably be used to predict the results of the insoluble dietary fiber method with the correction factors determined in this paper. These correction factors of commelinid <b>biomasses</b> are distinctive of those of non-commelinid magnoliophyta <b>biomasses.</b> The lignin content should be corrected for protein-like compounds, otherwise lignin is significantly overestimated. Owing to these correction factors, the biofuel (e. g. cellulosic ethanol and biomethanation production), bio-based chemicals and feed sectors can use the detergent fiber method to rapidly and reliably estimate the available amounts of lignin of plant <b>biomasses</b> and rank them according to their suitability to be converted based on their lignin content...|$|R
