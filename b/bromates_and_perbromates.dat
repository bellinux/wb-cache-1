40|$|To remove <b>bromate</b> <b>and</b> {{chromate}} from water, common {{methods include}} ion exchange, coagulation-flocculation processes, reductionprecipitation, etc., but these strategies can present some important disadvantages like incomplete removal, high cost, continuous use of reagents, and high energy costs. One {{of the most}} promising removal methods is the adsorption processes because of its high efficiency and low cost.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{treatment of}} brackish and seawaters with boron doped diamond anodes (BDD) {{can be particularly}} suitable {{for the removal of}} microorganisms, microalgae and pollutants: the high conductivity of these waters and the high content of chloride ions can be exploited in disinfection/oxidation processes mediated by active chlorine. A correct choice of operating conditions can limit the formation of such undesired by-products as <b>bromate</b> <b>and</b> chlorate ions. RESULTS: Galvanostatic electrolyses of synthetic waters containing chloride and/or bromide ions using BDD anode were carried out both in batch and continuous mode in an undivided cell. Bromide ions were oxidized to form bromate ions with high conversion rate, while chlorate ions were found as by-products of the oxidation of chloride ions together with active chlorine. When solutions containing Br- and Cl- were treated, the increase in the concentration of chloride up to that of seawater (20 g dm- 3), hinders the formation of BrO 3 - and ClO 3 -.

In this study, several groups of water disinfection byproducts were studied, including haloacetic acids (HAAs), halonitromethanes (HNMs), <b>bromate</b> <b>and</b> iodate. Three different water systems were studied including filtered natural seawater (NSW, ca. 64. 9 mg L- 1 Br-), a high-bromide (Br-) saltwater (HBSW, ca. 24. 8 mg L- 1 Br-), and low-Br- salt-water (LBSW, ca. 4. 3 mg L- 1 Br-). Because ozone reacts with Cl- to form free chlorine in seawater and salt water systems, similar DBP patterns were observed for both chlorine and ozone oxidants. The {{results revealed that}} some HAAs and HNMs are formed at greater than 100 mu g L- 1 concentrations and are greatly affected by water constituents and formulations when treated with chlorine and ozone. The results showed that in low-Br- water salt water, chlorinated HAAs and HNMs predominated, while much greater concentrations of brominated HAAs and HNMs were produced in both natural and synthetic higher Br- saltwater. Concentrations of <b>bromate</b> <b>and</b> iodate were strongly impacted by factors other than Br- and I- concentrations including whether the system was open or closed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
