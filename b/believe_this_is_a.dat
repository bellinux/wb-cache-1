While Nintendo has not confirmed its presence, journalists and players <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> tribute to Nintendo's former president Satoru Iwata; Golf was programmed by Iwata, the game can only be accessed if the system clock is set to July 11, the day that Iwata died, and use the Joy-Con in a motion similar to how Iwata would present in his Nintendo Direct presentations. Some Japanese users referred to this as a omamori (charm) left by Iwata himself.|$|E
500|$|Small {{whales are}} known to engage in complex play behaviour, which {{includes}} such things as producing stable underwater toroidal air-core vortex rings or [...] "bubble rings". There are two main methods of bubble ring production: rapid puffing of a burst of air {{into the water and}} allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring, or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the helical vortex currents thus formed. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex-rings, so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Some <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> means of communication. Whales are also known to produce bubble-nets for the purpose of foraging.|$|E

2500|$|Some denominations, {{especially}} Lutherans, {{have similar}} beliefs regarding the Eucharist and the Real Presence, though they reject the Roman Catholic concept of transubstantiation, preferring instead, {{the doctrine of}} the sacramental union, in which [...] "the body and blood of Christ are so truly united to the bread and wine of the Holy Communion that the two may be identified. They are at the same time body and blood, bread and wine...in this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith." [...] Lutherans hold that the miracle of the Eucharist is effected during the Words of Institution. Both the Eastern Orthodox Churches and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, such as the Coptic Church, insist [...] "on the reality of the change from bread and wine into the body and the blood of Christ at the consecration of the elements", although they have [...] "never attempted to explain the manner of the change", thus rejecting philosophical terms to describe it. The Methodist Church similarly holds that Christ is truly present in the Eucharist [...] "through the elements of bread and wine", but maintains that how He is present is a Holy Mystery. All Anglicans affirm the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, though Evangelical Anglicans believe that this is a pneumatic presence, while those of an Anglo-Catholic churchmanship <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> corporeal presence, {{but at the same time}} still rejecting the philosophical explanation of transubstantiation.|$|E

60|$|Now then we {{may come}} to Harvey himself. When you read Harvey's treatise, {{which is one of}} the most {{remarkable}} scientific monographs with which I am acquainted--it occupies between 50 and 60 pages of a small quarto in Latin, and is as terse and concise as it possibly can be--when you come to look at Harvey's work, you will find that he had long struggled with the difficulties of the accepted doctrine of the circulation. He had received from Fabricius, and from all the great authorities of the day, the current view of the circulation of the blood. But he was a man with that rarest of all qualities--intellectual honesty; and by dint of cultivating that great faculty, which is more moral than intellectual, it had become impossible for him to say he believed anything which he did not clearly <b>believe.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> most uncomfortable peculiarity--for it gets you into all sorts of difficulties with all sorts of people--but, for scientific purposes, it is absolutely invaluable. Harvey possessed this peculiarity in the highest degree, and so it was impossible for him to accept what all the authorities told him, and he looked into the matter for himself. But he was not hasty. He worked at his new views, and he lectured about them at the College of Physicians for nine years; he did not print them until he was a man of fifty years of age; and when he did print them he accompanied them with a demonstration which has never been shaken, and which will stand till the end of time. What Harvey proved, in short, was this (see Fig. 4)--that everybody had made a mistake, for want of sufficiently accurate experimentation as to the actual existence of the fact which everybody assumed. To anybody who looks at the blood-vessels with an unprejudiced eye it seems so natural that the blood should all come out of the liver, and be distributed by the veins to the different parts of the body, that nothing can seem simpler or more plain; and consequently no one could make up his mind to dispute this apparently obvious assumption. But Harvey did dispute it; and when he came to investigate the matter he discovered that it was a profound mistake, and that, all this time, the blood had been moving in just the opposite direction, namely, from the small ramifications of the veins towards the right side of the heart. Harvey further found that, in the arteries, the blood, as had previously been known, was travelling from the greater trunks towards the ramifications. Moreover, referring to the ideas of Columbus and of Galen (for he was a great student of literature, and did justice to all his predecessors), Harvey accepts and strengthens their view of the course of the blood through the lungs, and he shows how it fitted into his general scheme. If you will follow the course of the arrows in Fig. 4 you will see at once that--in accordance with the views of Columbus--the blood passes from the right side of the heart, through the lungs, to the left side. Then, adds Harvey, with abundant proof, it passes through the arteries to all parts of the body; and then, at the extremities of their branches in the different parts of the body, it passes (in what way he could not tell, for his means of investigation did not allow him to say) into the roots of the vents--then from the roots of the veins it goes into the trunk and veins--then to the right side of the heart--and then to the lungs, and so on.|$|E

That, you will observe, makes a complete circuit; and it was precisely here that the originality of Harvey lay. There never yet has been produced, and I do not believe there can be produced, a tittle of evidence to show that, before his time, any one had the slightest suspicion that a single drop of blood, starting in the left ventricle of the heart, passes through the whole arterial system, comes back through the venous system, goes through the lungs, and comes back to the place whence it started. But that is the circulation of the blood, and it was exactly this which Harvey was the first man to suspect, to discover, and to demonstrate.|$|E
