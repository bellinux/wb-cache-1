5|$|The next German {{aircraft}} on the scene, a Junkers 88, {{was engaged}} by a RAF Bristol Beaufighter which {{had appeared in}} the area earlier. Both machines crashed into the sea. Other German planes arrived but were driven off by Beaufighters and Hudsons from Coastal Command. The Atlantic weather conditions deteriorated. Amid concerns about the growing German threat and the realisation that the damaged small ships would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up, Commander Sayer ordered the crews off the smaller boats and had them sunk.|$|E
5|$|Elephants exhibit mirror self-recognition, an {{indication}} of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins. One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps {{to allow them to}} remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> track of the current location of their family members.|$|E
5|$|Like the board, {{which might}} be an ad hoc affair, the actual exam {{questions}} were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate {{was expected to be}} able to splice ropes, reef a sail, work a ship in sailing and shift his tides. In navigation, he was expected to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a reckoning of the ship's way by plane sailing, to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the variation of the compass. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an able seaman and midshipman.|$|E

5|$|The late preseason saw {{a wave of}} signings {{of players}} cut by other teams, {{particularly}} the Bengals and Colts. Signees included Isaac Hagins, Danny Reece, Dave Green, and Jack Novak, with Ira Gordon and camp standout Jim Cagle among those waived to make roster space for them. Running back Charlie Davis was also obtained via trade. The moves left the team with nine former Bengals on their roster, a situation they expected, as they knew that Bengals owner Paul Brown had more young talent than he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on his team. Linebacker Richard Wood {{was obtained from the}} New York Jets for a future draft choice, with injury-plagued running back Harold Hart placed on injured reserve to make roster space for him. Wood was the final roster addition of the preseason, and became the fifth ex-USC player on the roster.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} treatments for CML, but {{the standard of}} care for newly diagnosed patients is imatinib (Gleevec) therapy.

With this drug, more than 90% of patients will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the disease in check {{for at least five}} years, so that CML becomes a chronic, manageable condition.|$|E
25|$|While {{the army}} was going ashore, Tecumseh made her belated {{appearance}} and Farragut made his final dispositions for the fleet. The 14 wooden-hulled vessels would be lashed together in pairs, in a reprise of a tactic that the admiral had used earlier at the Battle of Port Hudson at Port Hudson, Louisiana. The intent was that, if a ship were to be disabled by battle damage to her engines, her partner would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her moving.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. and Soviet teams {{prepared}} for the medal round in different ways. Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov rested most of his best players, preferring to let them study plays rather than actually skate. U.S. coach Herb Brooks, however, continued with his tough, confrontational style, skating hard practices and berating his players for perceived weaknesses and to build stamina. Brooks' goal was to have his team <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with the Soviets through all three periods.|$|E

25|$|In Judaism, {{the main}} textual {{source for the}} belief in the end of days and {{accompanying}} events is the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible.

25|$|The Treaty of Warsaw and the Silent Sejm settled {{numerous}} contentious {{issues and}} resulted in limited reform of the state, encompassing {{a part of what}} was demanded by the more enlightened szlachta political publicists (Stanisław Szczuka, Stanisław Dunin-Karwicki). Poland-Saxony relationship was strictly limited to a personal union. Saxon ministers were barred from ruling on matters concerning the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The King was to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> only 1200 personal guard Saxon soldiers and was not allowed to reside in Saxony for prolonged periods.|$|E

25|$|Skating: A common fallacy is {{that the}} goaltender can get by with merely {{adequate}} skating, and often young players are placed in net because of their poor skating. In fact, the goaltender {{must be one of}} the best technical skaters on the team, and must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with the moves of every skater on opposing teams. In particular, goaltenders must be adept at lateral skating and quick pivoting. Goaltenders must also have exceptional leg strength and the capability for very explosive movement.|$|E
25|$|After Crystal Palace's {{failure to}} return to top-flight football, {{speculation}} about Johnson's future at the club began with a transfer to a Premier League club seeming highly likely. However, when an initial bid from Everton of £7.25million was rejected, it looked {{more likely that the}} club would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Johnson for a further year after all. Nevertheless, the departure of manager Iain Dowie only increased the likelihood of Johnson's departure, and on 24 May 2006 Palace accepted an £8.5mmillion offer from Wigan Athletic for Johnson. This bid was matched by fellow Lancashire club Bolton Wanderers a day later, which was also accepted.|$|E
25|$|In 1960 Robert Triffin, Belgian American economist, {{noticed that}} holding dollars was more {{valuable}} than gold because constant U.S. balance of payments deficits helped to keep the system liquid and fuel economic growth. What would later {{come to be known}} as Triffin's Dilemma was predicted when Triffin noted that if the U.S. failed to keep running deficits the system would lose its liquidity, not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with the world's economic growth, and, thus, bring the system to a halt. But incurring such payment deficits also meant that, over time, the deficits would erode confidence in the dollar as the reserve currency created instability.|$|E

25|$|The {{international}} {{balance of power}} was also shifting {{in favor of the}} Commonwealth because of the agreement with Russia in fall of 1656, motivated in part by the Tsardom's strategic interest in preventing a collapse of the Polish–Lithuanian state and uncontrolled expansion of Sweden. Not giving up its own claims and gains in the east, Russia moved against the Swedish forces in Livonia, which also facilitated their removal from Lithuania. This new situation forced Charles Gustav to alter his plans of conquering all of Poland and to propose a territorial partitioning scheme, under which the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was to be eliminated altogether and he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> at least some of Sweden's prospects.|$|E

But he also concedes she will not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> working for long as she will soon succumb to her cancer. Even so, Eva is determined to run for vice-president, and Perón fears that the military will stage a coup if she runs and that Eva's health is too delicate for any stressful work, but Eva insists she can continue, despite her failing health ("Dice Are Rolling/Eva's Sonnet").|$|E
