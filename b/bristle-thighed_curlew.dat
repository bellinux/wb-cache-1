25|$|Harold Gatty {{suggested}} that long-distance Polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of bird migrations. In “The Raft Book,” a survival guide {{he wrote for}} the U.S. military during World War II, Gatty outlined various Polynesian navigation techniques Allied sailors or aviators wrecked at sea could use {{to find their way}} to land. There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds and some say that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with the West Pacific Flyway. A voyage from Tahiti, the Tuamotus or the Cook Islands to New Zealand might have followed the migration of the long-tailed cuckoo (Eudynamys taitensis) just as the voyage from Tahiti to Hawaii would coincide with the track of the Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva) and the <b>bristle-thighed</b> <b>curlew</b> (Numenius tahitiensis). It is also believed that Polynesians employed shore-sighting birds as did many seafaring peoples. One theory is that they would have taken a frigatebird (Fregata) with them. These birds refuse to land on the water as their feathers will become waterlogged making it impossible to fly. When the voyagers thought they were close to land they may have released the bird, which would either fly towards land or else return to the canoe.|$|E

50|$|The <b>bristle-thighed</b> <b>curlew</b> (Numenius tahitiensis) is a {{medium-sized}} shorebird that breeds in Alaska and winters on tropical Pacific islands. It has a long, decurved bill and bristled feathers {{at the base}} of the legs. Its length is about 40-44 cm and wingspan about 84 cm (females averaging bigger than males). The size and shape are the same as the whimbrel's, and the plumage is similar, spotted brown on their upper body with a light belly and rust-colored or buffy tail. The bigger buff spots on the upper body, unmarked light belly and barely marked flanks, tail color, and pale buffy-orange rump distinguish it from the whimbrel.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife {{includes}} large {{colonies of}} seabirds {{on the islands}} and waterbirds and shorebirds in the many wetlands such as the Kuskokwim River delta, {{one of the largest}} waterbird nesting areas in the world and home to the world's largest communities of tundra swan, most of the world's emperor goose, and half of the world's black brant (Branta bernicla). The lagoon that forms the heart of Izembek National Wildlife Refuge on the Alaska Peninsula has also long been recognised as an important staging ground for migrating birds. Other birds of the coastal wetlands include <b>bristle-thighed</b> <b>curlew,</b> dotterel, bar-tailed godwit, and Pacific golden plover while seabirds of include Steller's eider and the large colonies of murre on the islands.|$|E
50|$|About 300 {{species of}} fish have been {{recorded}} from the reefs and inshore waters of the atoll. It is also visited by green turtles and Hawaiian monk seals. Seabird species recorded as breeding on the atoll include Bulwer's petrel, wedge-tailed shearwater, Christmas shearwater, white-tailed tropicbird, red-tailed tropicbird, brown booby, red-footed booby, masked booby, great frigatebird, spectacled tern, sooty tern, brown noddy, black noddy and white tern. It is visited by migratory shorebirds, including the Pacific golden plover, wandering tattler, <b>bristle-thighed</b> <b>curlew,</b> ruddy turnstone and sanderling. Possibilities of humpback whales using the waters as breeding ground has been suggested albeit in small numbers and irregular occurrences so far. Many other cetaceans possibly migrate through the area, but the species being most notably confirmed is Cuvier's beaked whales.|$|E

40|$|Avian long-distance {{migration}} {{involves the}} storage and expenditure of very large fuel loads. Birds may double in weight before take-off on flights of many 1000 km, {{and they may}} lose half their body mass over the subsequent few days that such trips take. Recent studies indicate {{that in addition to}} the storage and depletion of fat, the muscles and belly organs also undergo considerable changes in size in the course of such migrations. Such intraindividual and repeatedly reversed changes in stores and organ sizes represent a class of phenotypic plasticity called 'phenotypic flexibility'. Using preliminary comparative data for different populations of Bar-tailed Godwits Limosa lapponica, and several other shorebird species adding variation to the migration strategies sampled (Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria, Ruff Philomachus pugnax, Red Knot Calidris canutus and <b>Bristle-thighed</b> <b>Curlew</b> Numenius tahitiensis), the thesis is developed that the size of the organs carried during take-off represent evolutionary compromises between their functions during the storage, flight and post-arrival phases of migration. In all cases fat-free tissue along with fat is deposited during fuel storage, but the proportions vary a great deal between similarly sized species. Just before departure on long-distance flights, exercise organs (pectoral muscle and heart) tend to show hypertrophy and nutritional organs (stomach, intestine and liver) tend to show atrophy. Reductions in nutritional organs appear most pronounced in (sub-) species that are about to overfly barren oceans with few or no opportunities for emergency landings. Migrant birds seem to show a great deal of adaptive flexibility, and the study of this flexibility may shed light on (presently unknown) physiological mechanisms as well as on correlated ecological constraints on bird migration. ...|$|E
