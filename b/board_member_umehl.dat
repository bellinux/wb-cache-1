40|$|Role {{conflict}} between school <b>board</b> <b>members</b> and superintendents appears {{to exist in}} some Indiana school corporations. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate and report role perceptions of school <b>board</b> <b>member</b> duties and obligations as seen by <b>board</b> <b>members</b> and superintendents. A further {{purpose of the study was}} to identify task-related areas of disagreement regarding role responsibilities generally perceived by each respective response group. A questionnaire was designed to solicit responses from school <b>board</b> <b>members</b> and superintendents regarding perceived initial <b>board</b> <b>member</b> involvement with twenty-one educational tasks. Each task was arranged into a five step horizontal continuum, ranging from executive duties to legislative duties. Respondents were selected from a random sampling of Indiana school corporations which had been stratified according to student enrollment into three equal groups. Major findings derived from the analysis of data were: 1. School <b>board</b> <b>members</b> and superintendents demonstrated significant differences in perceptions regarding <b>board</b> <b>member</b> initial involvement with respect to ten of the twenty-one educational tasks. 2. In ten of the remaining eleven tasks, <b>board</b> <b>members</b> and superintendents demonstrated intragroup disagreement. 3. School <b>board</b> <b>members</b> and superintendents of different sized school corporations demonstrated intergroup disagreements. Major conclusions based on findings of the study were: 1. School <b>board</b> <b>members</b> fail to differentiate between the policy-making role of the school board and the administrative role of the superintendent. 2. School <b>board</b> <b>members</b> and superintendents are not consistent with respect to perceptions of initial <b>board</b> <b>member</b> involvement. 3. School <b>board</b> <b>members</b> and superintendents in different sized school corporations disagree concerning perceptions of initial <b>board</b> <b>member</b> assumption of responsibilities. Major recommendations based upon the findings and conclusions of the study were: 1. School <b>board</b> <b>members</b> and superintendents need to cooperatively plan orientation andtraining sessions in order to understand the processes of policy planning, policy development, and policy evaluation. 2. Research should be conducted to determine the effects of written policies and procedures upon the role perceptions of superintendents and <b>board</b> <b>members</b> regarding the duties and obligations of <b>board</b> <b>members.</b> 3. The study should be replicated with an enlarged sample to further validate the findings that were influenced by size of school corporation. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} uses a {{grounded theory}} approach {{to explore the}} term ‘experienced Board Member’ with research into the learning experiences which {{bridge the gap between}} an inexperienced <b>Board</b> <b>Member</b> and an experienced <b>Board</b> <b>Member.</b> The purpose of this research is to identify repeatable/reportable patterns which could be utilised and developed to improve <b>Board</b> <b>Member</b> learning. Data is derived from interviews with nine (current and past) New Zealand <b>Board</b> <b>Members.</b> A common set of attributes of an experienced <b>Board</b> <b>Member</b> emerged from the study. The linking theme of the attributes is that they support the process of reaching a quality agreement or decision. The {{results of this study suggest}} that an experienced <b>Board</b> <b>Member</b> is perceived to be a <b>Board</b> <b>Member</b> who contributes to achieving a quality agreement and decision, using attributes associated with: •	Contribution to Board processes •	Understanding and Knowledge (governance and business acumen) •	Internal Drivers •	Making Hard Decisions. Formative <b>Board</b> <b>Member</b> learning is associated with developing self confidence, understanding what content is perceived to be (or not to be) relevant, understanding the Boardroom protocols and processes, and understanding the responsibility of the role. The primary mechanism in <b>Board</b> <b>Member</b> learning is observation. <b>Board</b> <b>Member</b> learning was most often the development of tacit understanding through observing events internal to the Board. Learning events for <b>Board</b> <b>Members</b> are likely to arise as part of the dismissal/departure of the CEO or from internal Board dissension. The results also indicate that current NZ <b>Board</b> <b>Members</b> are unlikely to have had any formal preparation for the <b>Board</b> <b>Member</b> role, and learning for the role is likely to be ad-hoc and vicarious. This research suggests that the successful development of experienced <b>Board</b> <b>Members</b> will require a fundamental change in the perception and practice of <b>Board</b> <b>Member</b> development within organisations and at Board level. A Capability and Maturity Model is presented as a framework for assessing an organisation’s capability and maturity in terms of the development of its <b>Board</b> <b>Members.</b> This study builds on corporate governance theory by identifying attributes considered indicative of an experienced <b>Board</b> <b>Member.</b> This study adds to Learning Organisation and Knowledge theories by providing examples and comment on the place of Communities of Practice, and knowledge development within the development of <b>Board</b> <b>Member</b> experience...|$|R
