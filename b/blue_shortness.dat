40|$|Summary. Current {{methods for}} the {{examination}} of the steel cleanliness are the <b>blue</b> <b>shortness</b> test (macro purity grade in accordance with SEP 1584) and microscopy (micro purity grade in accordance with EN 50602). Both methods provide information about the inspected surfaces but no volumetric information is obtained. To overcome such drawbacks, it is proposed to apply an ultrasonic test in immersion technique in accordance with the SEP 1927 as a supplement or even alternate test. Important benefits of this volumetric test are a higher reproducibility and the possibility of establishing an automated testing procedure. The new test specification was published by the VDEh, the German Iron and Steel Institute. The KARL DEUTSCH company was {{an active member of the}} respective working group...|$|E
