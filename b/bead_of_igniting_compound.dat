50|$|A basic {{theatrical}} effect, {{designed to}} create a jet or fountain of sparks, {{is referred to as}} a gerb. A gerb consists of a sufficiently strong and non-flammable container to hold the pyrotechnic compound. Typical pyrotechnic formulations consist either of flammable materials such as nitrocellulose and/or black powder or a mixture of a fuel and oxidizer blended in situ. A plug placed {{at one end of the}} container with a small orifice, called a choke, constricts the expulsion <b>of</b> the <b>ignited</b> pyrotechnic <b>compound,</b> increasing the size and aggressiveness of the jet.|$|R

40|$|Fuel-oxidizer {{combinations}} {{capable of}} self-igniting simply on coming into mutual contact have been extensively used. in bi-liquid rockets. In hybrid (solid fuel-liquid oxidizer) rockets too the self-igniting (hypergolic) propellant could be suited ideally. The relative non-existence of the hybrid rockets has been {{partly because of}} the paucity of suitable hypergolic solid fuels. The development of such fuels is hampered {{because of the lack of}} understanding of the chemical reactions occurring between the fuel and the oxidizer leading to ignition. ne chemistry of these highly exothermic reactions occurring in sub-milliseconds in the pre-ignition stage is being studied for the past several years, in an effort to evolve suitable self-igniting systems. A major aspect of this work relates to the solid N-N-bonded derivatives of hydrazines, which have been conceived as self-igniting fuels for the first time. Many <b>of</b> these <b>compounds</b> <b>ignite</b> readily, with short ignition delays on coming into contact with liquid oxidizers, like HNO 3 and N 2 O 4. Polymeric resins having N-N bonds and reactive end-groups have been evolved to serve as fuel-binders for self-igniting compositions. This review narrates briefly the main highlights of the work carried out on hypergolic systems. A report on the hybrid rockets and their current status is also include...|$|R

50|$|A {{beadlock}} or bead lock is {{a mechanical}} device that secures the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> a tire {{to the wheel}} of a vehicle. Tires and wheels are designed so that, when the tire is inflated, the tire pressure pushes the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the tire against the inside of the wheel rim so that the tire stays on the wheel and the two rotate together. In situations where tire pressure is insufficient to hold the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the tire in place, a beadlock is needed.|$|R
