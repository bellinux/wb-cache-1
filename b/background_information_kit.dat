40|$|Two {{experiments}} were conducted (a) to evaluate how providing background infor-mation at test may benefit retrieval and (b) to further examine how providing back-ground information prior to study influences encoding. Half {{of the participants}} read <b>background</b> <b>information</b> prior to study, {{and the other half}} did not. In each group, half were presented with <b>background</b> <b>information</b> at test. <b>Background</b> <b>information</b> at test improved recall for those who did not read information prior to study. Results from Experiment 2 suggested that this improvement was due to <b>background</b> <b>information</b> providing content cues to retrieve specific ideas from the text rather than topic cues to support top-down recall. Concerning encoding effects, secondary measures and con-struction-integration modeling of free recall support the hypothesis that <b>background</b> <b>information</b> presented prior to study influences the effectiveness of organizational processing during encoding. In many educational and professional training environments, instruction within a domain often begins with the presentation of <b>background</b> <b>information.</b> In general, <b>background</b> <b>information</b> involves the presentation of material prior to study of the to-be-learned content that provides information related to but not necessarily con-tained within that content. For example, <b>background</b> <b>information</b> may explicitly state new facts or ideas relevant to the text content (e. g., informational outlines, definitions, or instructed theories). Some forms of <b>background</b> <b>information</b> may support the activation of a reader’s prior knowledge relevant to the text content (e. g., thematic titles, reading perspectives, or advanced organizers that provid...|$|R
40|$|Over the centuries, Pacific peoples have {{developed}} {{a wide variety of}} agroforestry systems on which they depend for services such as wind and erosion protection and for products such as food, medicines, perfumes, building materials, dyes, oils and forage. However, increasing pressure on land now threatens the sustainability of many traditional systems, while much of the local knowledge is being lost as people turn to cash crops and to single varieties of crop plants. In an effort to help farmers and those working with them adopt sustainable practices, working groups of extension agents and agroforestry practitioners painstakingly documented guidelines, facts and methods for good agroforestry practices in the islands. These have been compiled in a well-illustrated, easy-to-read <b>information</b> <b>kit</b> full of practical tips and useful references that will interest those concerned with agriculture in the Pacific region and beyond.

40|$|Program {{comprehension}} is a {{very important}} skill a software engineer need. Many researchers conduct experiments on program comprehension in order to improve tools, documentation, and maintenance guidelines supporting program comprehension. Individual programmers’ productivity might vary significantly even though they have similar background. Thus, the subjects’ background is very important when conducting and analyzing experiments on program comprehension. The survey presented in this short Master thesis identifies subjects <b>background</b> <b>information</b> reported in software experiments on program comprehension. The <b>background</b> <b>information</b> reported in 24 articles was systematically analyzed in order to answer what kind of <b>background</b> <b>information</b> is reported and how the <b>background</b> <b>information</b> was used in the analysis. The articles reports many different background variables, but the overall impression of the <b>background</b> <b>information</b> reported in program comprehension experiments is that it is rather arbitrary and small. The analysis shows {{that there is a need}} for standards and guidelines of how to collect and report subjects’ <b>background</b> <b>information.</b> The survey shows also that almost no <b>background</b> <b>information</b> of the subjects is used in the experiments’ analysis. The articles in this survey provide so little information about the subjects’ background that it is difficult to perform replications and meta-analysis. This thesis aims to make researchers more aware of the subjects’ background in their experiments and reports. On the basis of the results of the analysis I have suggested background variables that should be collected in comprehension studies and proposed a background questionnaire. The questionnaire was used in an experiment with 24 subjects from the industry. I report here experiences with the questionnaire...|$|R
