When an optically trapped <b>bead</b> <b>seals</b> on the lamellipodium membrane, Brownian fluctuations decrease revealing the underlying elementary events. The distribution of bead velocities has long tails with frequent large positive and negative values associated to forward and backward jumps occurring in 0. 1 – 0. 2  ms with varying amplitudes up to 20  nm. Jump frequency and amplitude are reduced when actin turnover is slowed down {{by the addition of}} 25  nM Jasplakinolide. When myosin II is inhibited by the addition of 20 μM Blebbistatin, jump frequency is reduced but to a lesser extent than by Jasplainolide.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of a novel, flexible, photocatalytic, oxygen-scavenging polymer film is described. The film incorporates nanocrystalline titania particles in an ethyl cellulose polymer film, {{with or without}} an added sacrificial electron donor of triethanolamine. When coated {{on the inside of}} a glass vessel its UV-driven light-scavenging action is demonstrated by platinum octaethyl porphyrin coated glass <b>beads</b> <b>sealed</b> inside, since their luminescence increases with increasing UV-irradiation time. When used as a flexible film, work with an oxygen electrode shows that the film is able to scavenge oxygen at an average rate of 0. 017 cm 3 O 2 h− 1 cm− 2 over a 24 h period, which compares favourably to other, well-established oxygen-scavenger systems. The potential of using such as system for oxygen scavenging in packaging is discussed briefly...|$|R

50|$|Activity of {{masters in}} artistic {{handling}} of metal in Caucasian Albania and in creation of samples of jewelry art, archaeological materials, consisting of rich variety of creations of jewelry art, makes to characterize {{such kind of}} arts {{as one of the}} most developed kinds of arts of that period. Different earrings, diadems, necklaces, beads, pendants, fibulas, buttons, clasps, bracelets, seal rings, belt buckles, belt sets and others gives a good presentation about a large diapason of creativity of jewelers of Caucasian Albania. Two periods can be distinguished in development of jewelry art in Caucasian Albania: the first from the 4th century BC - 1st century AD and the second from the 1st - 7th centuries AD. Production of such kinds of jewelry art as pendants, plaques, buttons, earrings, diadems, necklaces, bracelets and others are typical for the first period. The second period is considered the most developed because of richness of artistic and plastic forms and for use of different technology. For example, 22 burials were opened on the left shore of the Kura River, in Sudagylan (near Mingachevir), in during 1949-1950, in log cabins. Jewelry items made of gold and silver, golden <b>beads,</b> <b>seal</b> rings with mounting seals are also enumerated in report.|$|R

5000|$|The Neolithic {{people in}} the Nile Valley likely came from Sudan, {{as well as the}} Sahara, and there was shared culture with the two areas and with that of Egypt during this period. By the 5th {{millennium}} BC, the people who inhabited what is now called Nubia participated in the Neolithic revolution. Saharan rock reliefs depict scenes that have been thought to be suggestive of a cattle cult, typical of those seen throughout parts of Eastern Africa and the Nile Valley even to this day. Megaliths discovered at Nabta Playa are early examples of what seems {{to be one of the}} world's first astronomical devices, predating Stonehenge by almost 2,000 years. This complexity as observed at Nabta Playa, and as expressed by different levels of authority within the society there, likely formed the basis for the structure of both the Neolithic society at Nabta and the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Around 3500 BC, the second [...] "Nubian" [...] culture, termed the A-Group, arose. It was a contemporary of, and ethnically and culturally very similar to, the polities in predynastic Naqada of Upper Egypt. The A-Group people were engaged in trade with the Egyptians. This trade is testified archaeologically by large amounts of Egyptian commodities deposited in the graves of the A-Group people. The imports consisted of gold objects, copper tools, faience amulets and <b>beads,</b> <b>seals,</b> slate palettes, stone vessels, and a variety of pots. Around 3300 BC, there is evidence of a unified kingdom, as shown by the finds at Qustul, that maintained substantial interactions (both cultural and genetic) with the culture of Naqadan Upper Egypt. The Nubian culture may have even contributed to the unification of the Nile Valley.|$|R

In the period from late third millennium to early second millennium, the antiquaries revealed an urban habitation with artisans' houses. Also unearthed were 62 double-tiered kilns, <b>beads</b> and <b>seals,</b> four stepped ziggurats, female terracotta figurines with plaited hair, stone vessels, hafted bronze and copper daggers with flat blades, tabbed silver and bronze seals, paintings of animals such as goats, eagles, panthers and three headed composite animal, a priest's tomb with gold heads of a wolf and a bull, and other tombs with silver ornaments, precious stones and seals. One quarter of a ‘nobility’ seal with two signs in Indus script is conjectured to be that of Bronze Age settlers in Altyndepe. However, the settlement gradually disappeared (it was deserted around 1600 BC) as a result of climatic changes; people migrated to the Mugrab region, another area of South Uzbekistan (Sapali), and Northern Afghanistan (Dashli). Further, these findings confirmed the Middle Asian interaction from the north to the Oxus civilization.|$|R

40|$|DNA {{sequencing}} advancements in {{cost and}} throughput are under intensive development to enable widespread discovery of genomics information. Some groups {{have focused on}} conventional dideoxy sequencing, making improvements that include performing separations in microchannels [1], while others have shifted to using cyclic array sequencing technologies [2]. Our group has previously published a cyclic array technique, sequencing by ligation, using DNA templates tethered to immobilized, 1 µm diameter, polystyrene beads [3]. In this work {{we report on the}} extension of this technique to a microchannel chip for the open-source Polonator instrument, with resulting 12 × reduction in reagent usage-a dominant cost. The microchannel chip consists of an array of 32 addressable channels etched in silicon that is then bonded to borofloat glass. The channels are addressable through individual ports to permit multiplexing of individual <b>bead</b> arrays. Subsequently <b>sealing</b> these ports with polyimide tape allows a single system inlet and outlet to deliver common reagents as required for cyclic array sequencing. Beads are bound in monolayers on the channel’s glass surface by selectively passivating and silanizing the silicon and glass, respectively. Specifically, passivation is achieved through C 4 F 8 fluoropolymer deposition prior to anodic bonding, and silanization is performed with aminopropyltriethoxysilane that enables bead binding through NHS-ester crosslinking.

40|$|Tribo-electrification is an {{important}} phenomenon in powder handling, as it could cause hazards and nuisance, such as dust explosion, adhesion to walls and blockage of pipelines leading to powder losses and difficulties in flow control. At present, {{there are only a}} few methods available to predict the dynamic charging of bulk powders, and they are not suitable for testing a small quantity of powders or handling highly active powders, for which full isolation would be needed. In this paper, the operation of a simple test device is analysed. Tribo-electrification of a single spherical <b>bead</b> inside a <b>sealed</b> capsule is induced through a horizontal motion using a shaking device at various frequencies. The single particle contact charge obtained from experiments is incorporated in numerical simulations based on Distinct Element Method (DEM) and is used to predict the transient charge accumulation of an assemblage of beads. In the model, the tribo-charging of a single bead is related to the contact area of the bead on impact with the capsule wall. The effects of long range forces, space charge and image charge at boundary condition are investigated for bulk charging. It is shown that the inclusion of space charge effects and boundary condition into the DEM model leads to a better prediction of charge build-up when compared with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The {{main subject}} of this {{dissertation}} is the Mycenaean archaeological evidence from the south-eastern Aegean. The term "Mycenaean" is typically {{used to refer to}} the dominant archaeological culture of the central and southern Greek mainland during the Late Bronze Age, which is dated between about 1700 and 1050 BC. In this research the focus has been on the period from the 14 th to 13 th centuries BC, during which strong Mycenaean influences are visible in the archaeological record of the south-eastern Aegean. These are especially clear from the large number of Mycenaean finds which have come to light in settlements and tombs. A wide variety of Mycenaean goods is represented, comprising different types of pottery vessels, bronze weapons and tools, glass and stone jewelry <b>beads,</b> and stone <b>seals</b> and implements. The main aim of this dissertation is to establish whether Mycenaean (material) culture was used to express different group identities in tombs in the south-eastern Aegean. The method that is used in this dissertation to study group identities is called "neo-culture history". It is based on the analysis of the archaeological assemblages found inside tombs, which are regarded as the material manifestation of the activities through which these identities were expressed. In this way, a new light is shed on the social dynamics characterizing the societies of the south-west coast of Anatolia and adjacent islands in the Late Bronze Age...|$|R
40|$|Lay down of {{viscoelastic}} fluids {{is common}} in several manufacturing processes. In the automotive industry, sealing material is sprayed onto the vehicle body to prevent water leakage into cavities and to reduce noise. To predict the deposition and lower the environmental impact by reducing material consumption, a detailed physical understanding of the process is important. In this work the resulting surface multi-phase flow is modeled and simulated in IBOFlow, the in-house multi-phase flow solver at the Fraunhofer-Chalmers Centre. In the solver the two phase flow is modelled by the volume of fluid method and the viscoelastic fluid by a general Carreu rheology model. In the solver the scanned or CAD geometry is handled by the hybrid immersed boundary method and the material interface is resolved by the adaptive anisotropic octree grid. The resulting hanging octree and triangular nodes along the geometry are automatically handled by the immersed boundary method. To boost the computational performance the simulation domain is in a novel way dynamically divided into an active and an inactive part. The governing equations are only assembled and solved for in the active part, which {{is determined by the}} local position of the injection nozzle. The interface between the active and the inactive cells are handled by symmetry boundary conditions and the pressure is always set for a point inside the active domain. The sealing lay down simulation is successfully validated for a number of real <b>sealing</b> <b>beads</b> on a plate and on a Volvo V 40 vehicle. Finally, the importance of resolving the nozzle in the simulation is investigated for a static case...|$|R
40|$|Wide bandgap {{semiconductors}} {{are being}} widely investigated {{because they have}} the potential to satisfy the stringent material requirements of high resolution, room temperature gamma-ray spectrometers. In particular, Cadmium Zinc Telluride (Cd 1 -xZnxTe, x~ 0. 1) and Thallium Bromide (TlBr), due to their combination of high resistivity, high atomic number and good electron mobility, have became very promising candidates for use in X- and gamma-ray detectors operating at room temperature. In this study, carrier trapping times were measured in CZT and TlBr as a function of temperature and material quality. Carrier lifetimes and tellurium inclusion densities were measured in detector-grade Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) crystals grown by the High Pressure Bridgman method and Modified Bridgman method. Excess carriers were produced in the material using a pulsed YAG laser with a 1064 nm wavelength and 7 ns pulse width. Infrared microscopy was used to measure the tellurium defect densities in CZT crystals. The electronic decay was optically measured at room temperature. Spatial mapping of lifetimes and defect densities in CZT was performed to determine the relationship between defect density and electronic decay. A significant and strong correlation was found between the volume fraction of tellurium inclusions and the carrier trapping time. Carrier trapping times and tellurium inclusions were measured in CZT in the temperature range from 300 K to 110 K and the results were analyzed using a theoretical trapping model. Spatial mapping of carrier trapping times and defect densities in CZT was performed to determine the relationship between defect density and electronic decay. While a strong correlation between trapping time and defect density of tellurium inclusions was observed, there was no significant change in the trap energy. Carrier trapping times were measured in detector grade thallium bromide (TlBr) and compared with the results for cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) in a temperature range from 300 K to 110 K. The experimental data was analyzed using a trapping model. In CZT, because the majority carrier concentration is close to the intrinsic carrier concentration, the trapping time increases exponentially as the temperature decreases below about 160 K. While, in TlBr, the majority carrier concentration is many orders of magnitude greater than the intrinsic carrier concentration and the trapping time followed a temperature dependence over the range of temperatures studied. The results of the model suggest that a moderately deep compensation center, located approximately 200 meV {{from the middle of the}} bandgap, could be used to significantly increase the room temperature trapping time in TlBr. The results of this model demonstrate that the room temperature trapping time in TlBr can, in principle, approach 0. 1 ms through the introduction of a moderately deep compensation level but without decreasing the overall trap concentration. This strategy is not possible in CZT, because the band gap is too small to use a moderately deep compensation level while still maintaining high material resistivity. Carrier trapping times were measured in three polycrystalline TlBr samples produced by melting commercial TlBr <b>beads</b> in a <b>sealed</b> quartz ampoule for two hours at three different temperatures near the melting point. The trapping time decreased with increasing melting temperature, presumably due to the thermal generation of a trap state...|$|R
