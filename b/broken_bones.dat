5|$|The {{church does}} not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, {{physicians}} for <b>broken</b> <b>bones,</b> and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine. Between the 1880s and 1990s the avoidance of medical treatment led {{to the deaths of}} several adherents and their children. Parents and others were prosecuted for, and in a few cases convicted of, manslaughter or neglect.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy is a {{group of}} {{neurological}} disorders characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally <b>broken</b> <b>bones.</b> In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition.|$|E
25|$|Osteoporosis is {{a disease}} where {{increased}} bone weakness {{increases the risk of}} a <b>broken</b> <b>bone.</b> It is the most common reason for a <b>broken</b> <b>bone</b> among the elderly. Bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine, the bones of the forearm, and the hip. Until a <b>broken</b> <b>bone</b> occurs there are typically no symptoms. Bones may weaken {{to such a degree that}} a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously. Chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities may occur following a <b>broken</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|R

5|$|James Polehinke, {{the first}} officer, {{suffered}} serious injuries, including multiple <b>broken</b> <b>bones,</b> a collapsed lung, and severe bleeding. Lexington-Fayette and airport police officers pulled Polehinke {{out of the}} wreckage. Polehinke underwent surgery for his injuries, including an amputation of his left leg. Doctors later determined that Polehinke had suffered brain damage and has no memory of the crash or the {{events leading up to}} it. , Polehinke was a wheelchair user. During the same month, Polehinke filed a lawsuit against the airport and the company that designed the runway and taxi lights. A January 2014 episode of Piers Morgan Live reported that Polehinke was paraplegic.|$|E

There were injuries from the quake {{on both sides of}} the border. The state Office of Emergency Preparedness declared 61 injuries on the American side and police claimed that 30 were injured in Mexico. The Red Cross stated that cuts from broken glass, bruises from falling objects, and a few <b>broken</b> <b>bones</b> were reported. California's Interstate 8 developed cracks in it, but vehicles were still able to traverse the highway. The CaliforniaHighwayPatrol warned drivers that use of the road would be at their own risk.|$|E
5|$|The main {{buyers of}} {{medicine}} made from slow lorises are middle- to upper-class women {{between the ages}} of 25 and 45 who primarily use loris rice wine tonic to alleviate the pain of childbirth. One bottle of wine is made by mixing rice wine with the carcasses of three dead animals. Minority groups in Cambodia also use loris-based medicine for treating <b>broken</b> <b>bones,</b> asthma, and sexually transmitted diseases. A survey by primatologist Anna Nekaris etal. (2010) showed that these belief systems were so strong that the majority of respondents expressed reluctance to consider alternatives to loris-based medicines.|$|E

5|$|After {{a year in}} San Diego, Washington {{was traded}} again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to <b>broken</b> <b>bones</b> in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert and Randy Smith to Portland in {{exchange}} for the center. This became the second time he had been traded along with Kunnert. The center signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Port Vale's Micky Adams {{appointed}} Horsfield as player-assistant manager. He {{aimed to}} play a majority of Vale's games in the 2009–10 season while learning the ropes of management. He played in the opening four {{games of the season}} despite needing painkillers for a cracked rib and a cracked bone in his hand, the first <b>broken</b> <b>bones</b> he had ever suffered. The club reached the third round of the League Cup, but after three consecutive defeats, Adams placed the entire squad on the transfer list. He suffered from niggling injuries, in addition to a torn hamstring, which limited his appearances. This caused him to consider his retirement in the summer of 2010. Port Vale did not offer him a new playing contract, but did retain him on the coaching staff.|$|E
5|$|Wounds {{were treated}} by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection, while opium thyme and {{belladona}} {{were used to}} relieve pain.

Moldy bread, honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set <b>broken</b> <b>bones,</b> and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.|$|E

5|$|Hill raced at open {{competitions}} and Top Fuel {{events from}} 1955 until {{he retired in}} 1966. After opening a motorcycle shop, he returned several years later to race motorcycles. He started racing drag boats after attending a drag boat event in 1974 and he won championships {{in all of the}} major boat drag racing sanctioning bodies. Hill set the lowest wet elapsed time (e.t.) record with a 5.16-second run, which was lower than the land drag racing record of 5.39seconds. He quit water drag racing after he suffered <b>broken</b> <b>bones</b> at a crash in Arizona and returned to land drag racing in 1985. Initially underfunded and unsuccessful, Hill set the all-time speed record at a National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) event in 1987, becoming the first person to hold both the land and water speed records simultaneously. In 1993, Hill became the NHRA's oldest Top Fuel champion. When Hill retired in 1999, he had won 12national season point championships on land or water, and had won more than 100trophies in motorcycles and 86drag events between his land and water careers.|$|E

The story then turns to the baffling double murder of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue, a fictional street in Paris. According to newspaper accounts, the mother {{was found in a}} yard behind the house, with multiple <b>broken</b> <b>bones</b> and her throat so deeply cut that her head fell off when the body was moved. The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into a chimney. The murders occurred in a fourth-floor room that was locked from the inside; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor, several bloody tufts of gray hair, and two bags of gold coins. Several witnesses reported hearing two voices {{at the time of the}} murder, one male and French, but disagreed on the language spoken by the other. The speech was unclear, and every witness admits that he does not know the language he claims to have heard.|$|E
