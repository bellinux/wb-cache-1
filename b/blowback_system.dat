2500|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, several {{manufacturers}} had introduced semi-automatic [...]22 sporting rifles, including Winchester, Remington, Fabrique Nationale and Savage Arms, all using the direct blow-back system of operation. Winchester introduced a medium caliber semi-automatic sporting rifle, the Model 1907 as an upgrade to the Model 1905, utilizing a <b>blowback</b> <b>system</b> of operation, in calibers such as [...]351 Winchester. Both the Models of 1905 and 1907 saw limited {{military and police}} use.|$|E
2500|$|Since blank {{cartridges}} generate {{very little}} recoil, {{far less than}} that produced by a live round, the recoil operation mechanism is not suitable for use with blanks. [...] BFAs used with recoil operated firearms typically replace the locked breech of a recoil operated firearm with a simple <b>blowback</b> <b>system</b> using a restricted barrel, similar to a gas operated BFA. [...] Short recoil operated pistols, {{the most common type}} used for self-defense and by police, are typically converted with a simple barrel replacement; the replacement barrel will lack the locking lugs to lock the slide to the frame, and will be built with an adjustable restrictor to control the chamber pressure. [...] On designs with tilting barrels (again, the majority of modern designs are like this) there may also be a provision for tilting the barrel back, simulating the unlocking of the slide [...] this is visible in US Patent 5,585,589 listed below.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]380 ACP {{cartridge}} {{was derived}} from Browning's earlier [...]38 ACP design, which was only marginally more powerful. The [...]380 ACP {{was designed to be}} truly rimless, with headspace on the case mouth instead of the rim for better accuracy. These relatively low-powered designs were intended for blowback pistols which lacked a barrel locking mechanism, which is often required for any handgun firing a round more powerful than a [...]380. Using blowback operation, the design can be simplified, and lowered in cost; a locking mechanism is unnecessary, since the mass of the slide and strength of the recoil spring are enough to absorb the recoil energy of the round, due to the round's relatively low bolt thrust. Blowback operation also permits the barrel to be permanently fixed to the frame, which promotes accuracy, unlike a traditional short recoil-operation pistol, which requires a [...] "tilting" [...] barrel to unlock the slide and barrel assembly when cycling. A drawback of the <b>blowback</b> <b>system</b> is that it requires a certain amount of slide mass (weight) to counter the recoil of the round used. The higher the power the round, the heavier the slide assembly has to be in order for its inertia to safely absorb the recoil, meaning that a typical blowback pistol in a given caliber will be heavier than an equivalent recoil-operated weapon (alternatively, a very stiff spring will work, but will make operating the slide very difficult). Blowback weapons can be made in calibers larger than [...]380 ACP, but the required weight of slide and strength of spring makes this an unattractive option. Although the low power of the [...]380 ACP does not require a locking mechanism, there have also been a number of locked-breech pistols chambered in [...]380 ACP, such as the Remington Model 51, Kel-Tec P3AT and Glock 42; all three being designed to be lighter than blowback operated [...]380 ACP weapons. There have also been some relatively diminutive (blowback-operated) submachine guns, such as the Ingram MAC-11 and the Czech vz. 83.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} {{is that there is}} a very strong lock in the locked breech action where the <b>blowback</b> <b>systems</b> rely more on springs and the weight of components to provide safe operation. The type of action used by a firearms designer will be determined by the design goal inherent for that firearm. The three actions described are increasingly more expensive to manufacture.|$|R
5000|$|What {{is common}} to all <b>blowback</b> <b>systems</b> is that the {{cartridge}} case must move under the direct action of the powder pressure, therefore any gun in which the bolt is not rigidly locked and permitted to move while there remains powder pressure in the chamber will undergo a degree of blowback action. The energy from the expansion of gases on firing appears {{in the form of}} kinetic energy transmitted to the bolt mechanism, which is controlled and used to operate the firearm's operation cycle. The extent to which blowback is employed largely depends on the manner used to control the movement of the bolt and the proportion of energy drawn from other systems of operation. How the movement of the bolt is controlled is where <b>blowback</b> <b>systems</b> differ. <b>Blowback</b> operation is most often divided into three categories, all using residual pressure to complete the cycle of operation: simple blowback (often just [...] "blowback"), delayed/retarded blowback, and advanced primer ignition.|$|R

50|$|The Stacked-tubed <b>blowback</b> <b>system</b> {{was first}} created by PMI for their PMI-III, later renamed as the VM-68.|$|E
5000|$|Several <b>blowback</b> <b>systems</b> {{exist within}} this broad {{principle}} of operation, each distinguished by {{the methods used}} to control bolt movement. In most actions that use blowback operation, the breech is not locked mechanically {{at the time of}} firing: the inertia of the bolt and recoil spring(s), relative to the weight of the bullet, delays opening of the breech until the bullet has left the barrel. [...] A few locked breech designs use a form of blowback (example: primer actuation) to perform the unlocking function.|$|R
50|$|The SG 510 {{is derived}} from the AM55 used during the 1950s. It is a {{selective}} fire rifle that employs a roller-delayed <b>blowback</b> operating <b>system.</b> Unusually, it was fitted with a shiny stainless steel bayonet.|$|R
5000|$|Electric {{blowback}} {{can also}} {{refer to a}} feature in some higher-end guns which offers more realistic operation. Companies such as G&G now offer guns such as the combat machine M4 and the combat machine [...] "RK47" [...] which has moving parts linked directly to the main mechanism of the gun, such as the bolt. Echo 1 has recently released a Blowback MP5SD. Also, APS (Accuracy Pneumatics Shooting) makes EBB M4A1, M4 Commando, and the AK47. The M4s also have 3 others with an RIS unit. These weapons perform identically to similar non-blowback offerings, with the added realism of reciprocating bolts and some recoil. Most models incorporate pneumatic <b>blowback</b> <b>systems</b> but some feature mechanical systems.|$|R
50|$|The KRISS Vector {{series is}} a family of weapons based upon the parent submachine gun design {{developed}} by KRISS USA, formerly Transformational Defense Industries (TDI). They use an unconventional delayed <b>blowback</b> <b>system</b> combined with in-line design to reduce perceived recoil and muzzle climb.|$|E
50|$|The Benelli CB-M2 was {{a unique}} submachine gun of Italian {{conception}} resulting from {{a joint venture between}} Benelli and Fiocchi Munizioni, the biggest ammunition manufacturer of Italy. The weapon was operated by a simple <b>blowback</b> <b>system,</b> which is very common for submachine guns. The unusual aspect of the weapon was the round itself.|$|E
50|$|Another {{interesting}} feature {{about the}} weapon {{is that it}} was bullpup in design, which means that the magazine is located behind the trigger, and also utilized the <b>blowback</b> <b>system</b> of operation. The bullpup design was a significant tactical advantage because it increased the firearm's compactness and allowed for a smaller, lighter and more efficient firearm.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} A5 is a semi-automatic, open bolt blow-back operated, sear-trigger paintball marker. Its inline <b>blowback</b> gas <b>system</b> can utilize both CO2 and HPA propellants. Standard marker includes single-finger trigger, 8.5 in (216 mm) ported barrel, {{front and}} rear sights, tournament-legal velocity adjuster, opaque black 200-round wide-mouth hopper and Cyclone-Feed System.|$|R
50|$|The firm of Grossfuss in Dobelin {{produced}} a unique retarded <b>blowback</b> gas-actuated <b>system,</b> no specimens {{of which has}} ever been seen. The Grossfuss weapon was reported exhibited to the Spree Ministry Waffenkommission, but apparently never reached WaPruf 2 for Development and Testing of the Heereswaffenamt. Development was dated late 1944 or early 1945.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{semi-automatic}} rifles firing [...]22 LR cartridges {{will often}} only work properly when firing standard or high velocity rimfire ammunition, as the low recoil of subsonic rounds {{is insufficient to}} cycle the weapon's action. Rifles with manual actions do not have this problem. Due to the low bolt thrust of the [...]22 LR cartridge, most self-loading firearms chambered for the cartridge use the direct <b>blowback</b> operation <b>system.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The HK36 used H&K's delayed <b>blowback</b> <b>system,</b> with a four-position {{selector}} switch for the firing mode. In order {{from top to}} bottom, these were safe (marked [...] "0"), single-shot ("1"), full-automatic ("25" [...] or [...] "30") and controlled burst ("3")—however, the weapon {{was intended to be}} available with 2-, 3-, 4- or 5-round burst mode.|$|E
5000|$|The Z84 is a Spanish {{machine pistol}} {{created by the}} Star Bonifacio Echeverria of Spain. It is an {{automatic}} pistol firing a 9×19mm parabellum round. Its operating mechanism consists of a <b>blowback</b> <b>system</b> with a telescoping bolt, this helps keep the dimensions short making it more compact. This makes it a favorite of Spanish security personnel ...|$|E
50|$|The locked-breech <b>blowback</b> <b>system</b> {{mirrored}} that of John Pedersen's Remington Model 51 {{only with}} a locking recess above rather than below the bolt. When the firearm is in battery, the breech block rests slightly forward of the locking shoulder in the frame. When the cartridge is fired, the breech block and bolt carrier move together a short distance rearward powered by {{the energy of the}} cartridge as in a standard <b>blowback</b> <b>system.</b> When the breech block contacts the locking shoulder, it stops, locking the breech. The bolt carrier continues rearward with the momentum it acquired in the initial phase. This delay allows chamber pressure to drop to safe levels while the breech is locked and the cartridge slightly extracted. Once the bullet leaves the barrel and pressure drops, the continuing motion of the bolt carrier cams the breech block from its locking recess, continuing the operating cycle.|$|E
5|$|These {{guns were}} {{air-cooled}} {{and used a}} gas <b>blowback</b> recoil <b>system.</b> Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II {{the barrel of the}} 20mm Oerlikon gun did not recoil, the breechblock never locked against the breech and actually moved forward when the gun fired. This weapon lacked a counter-recoil brake, as the force of the counter-recoil was checked by the explosion of the next round of ammunition.|$|R
5000|$|The StG 45(M) (''''Sturmgewehr 45'''' {{literally}} [...] "storm rifle" [...] or [...] "assault rifle 1945") {{sometimes referred}} to as the MP 45(M), was a prototype assault rifle developed by Mauser for the Wehrmacht at the end of World War II, using an innovative roller-delayed <b>blowback</b> operating <b>system.</b> It fired the 7.92×33mm Kurz (or [...] "Pistolenpatrone 7.9mm") intermediate cartridge at a cyclic rate of around 450 rounds per minute.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blowback</b> is a <b>system</b> of {{operation}} for self-loading firearms that obtains {{energy from the}} motion of the cartridge case as it is pushed to the rear by expanding gas created by the ignition of the propellant charge.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Para-Ordnance {{announced}} the TTR [...] "Tactical Target Rifle", which featured an over-the-barrel delayed gas <b>blowback</b> <b>system,</b> dubbed DIGS, which lessens recoil {{when compared with}} a traditional gas system. The TTR also relocated the recoil spring assembly over the barrel and under the handguard, allowing it to have a true folding stock. Production ceased in 2011 when Para USA exited the rifle market.|$|E
50|$|The SIG SG 510 or Sturmgewehr 57 is a {{selective}} fire battle rifle manufactured by Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (now SAN Swiss Arms) of Switzerland. It uses a roller-delayed <b>blowback</b> <b>system</b> {{similar to the}} H&K G3 and CETME rifles.The SIG SG 510-1 entered service in the Swiss Army with the designation Fass 57 (French/Italian, for Fusil dAssault 57/Fucile d Assalto 57) or Stgw 57 (German for Sturm Gewehr 57).|$|E
50|$|The MP7 uses a short-stroke piston {{gas system}} as used on H&K's G36 and HK416 assault rifles, {{in place of}} a <b>blowback</b> <b>system</b> {{traditionally}} seen on sub-machine guns including those by H&K. The 4.6×30mm ammunition is exclusive to the gun and offers low recoil. This ammunition is unique among submachine guns in that the bullet is made almost entirely of a hardened steel penetrator instead of softer copper or lead.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, Heckler & Koch {{developed}} the 9mm Parabellum MP5 submachine gun. The MP5 {{is based on}} the G3 rifle and uses the same closed-bolt roller-delayed <b>blowback</b> operation <b>system.</b> This makes the MP5 more accurate than open-bolt SMGs, such as the UZI. The MP5 {{is also one of the}} most widely used submachine guns in the world, having been adopted by 40 nations and numerous military, law enforcement, intelligence, and security organizations.|$|R
50|$|The Steyr GB is a semi-automatic, blowback-operated firearm. It {{features}} a unique gas-delayed <b>blowback</b> locking <b>system</b> {{based on the}} Barnitzke system, first used in the Volkssturmgewehr 1-5, and subsequently in the Swiss Pistole 47 W+F (Waffenfabrik Bern) prototype pistol. The Barnitzke system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge and feeds it through a small port in the barrel {{in front of the}} chamber to retard the rearward motion of the slide.|$|R
25|$|The FAMAS uses {{a delayed}} <b>blowback</b> {{operating}} <b>system</b> that functions best with French-specified steel-casing 5.56x45mm ammunition. Using standard brass-casing 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition employed by other armies can create over-pressure and case ruptures in the FAMAS, {{which can lead}} to severe malfunctions. Using incorrectly built ammunition also results in approximately two minor injuries for every million rounds fired from a FAMAS. As a result, the French military has discreetly banned the use of foreign-produced ammunition in all French-issued FAMAS rifles.|$|R

50|$|This {{problem is}} {{exacerbated}} when using a fully electronic marker. Most mechanical markers use a <b>blowback</b> <b>system</b> for recocking, or other methods where a large reciprocating mass is involved. This will shake the {{balls in the}} hopper slightly, facilitating gravity feed. A marker with both electronically controlled recocking and firing may exhibit no shake whatsoever while operating. Because of this, small packs in the hopper are not broken up and feeding problems result.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, several {{manufacturers}} had introduced semi-automatic [...]22 sporting rifles, including Winchester, Remington, Fabrique Nationale and Savage Arms, all using the direct blow-back system of operation.

50|$|The Mannlicher 1900, 1901 and the Modelo 1905 all use {{the same}} <b>blowback</b> {{operating}} <b>system.</b> Fowler, North, and Stronge describe blowback-operated weapons as using the pressure from the spent round to push a bolt that is located behind the round back and forth against a spring. The pressure forces the slide back against the spring and ejects the spent cartridge. Then, a new round enters the chamber and the compressed spring pushes the bolt forward again, loading the bullet into the breech, leaving the gun ready to fire again.|$|R
2500|$|The SIG 522LR is a [...]22-caliber {{sporting}} rifle styled {{after the}} SG 551. It uses a simple <b>blowback</b> semi-automatic operating <b>system</b> and its barrel has a 406mm (1:16 in) twist rate. Due to its operating principle, the rifle has no mechanical commonality with other SG 550 variants. The SIG522 accepts commonly available AR-style [...]22-caliber conversion magazines.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, Jean-Louis Gathoye of FN filed a United States patent {{application}} for a delayed <b>blowback</b> operating <b>system</b> intended for the Five-seven pistol, and U.S. Patent 5,347,912 ("Elements for decelerating the recoil of the moving parts of a fire arm") was received the following year. In 1995, FN officially announced development of the Five-seven pistol, and a prototype of the pistol was publicly displayed the following year. With some improvements, a double-action only model of the pistol went into production in 1998, and a single-action model called the Five-seven Tactical was then introduced shortly afterward. The Five-seven first entered service in May 2000, when the Cypriot National Guard (Εθνική Φρουρά) purchased 250 pistols for their special forces group.|$|R
