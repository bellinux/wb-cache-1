The experimental research is conducted <b>by</b> <b>using</b> quasi-experimental design. This research employs two groups experimental. This is comparing two groups to see which one is effective {{to be used in}} helping the students in writing. The first group is employed <b>by</b> <b>using</b> YouTube videos and the second group is treated <b>by</b> <b>using</b> pictures. Both of YouTube and pictures are the authentic materials which help the students to have better writing performance. The subjects are the second semester students of English Department, IKIP PGRI Madiun. Both of the groups, the students are asked to write paragraph <b>by</b> <b>using</b> YouTube videos and pictures as the authentic materials. The data are analyzed <b>by</b> <b>using</b> Independent t-test. The result of the study shows that there is significantly different between the students who write paragraph after being treated <b>by</b> <b>using</b> YouTube videos and <b>by</b> <b>using</b> pictures as the authentic materials. The students who are treated <b>by</b> <b>using</b> YouTube videos have lower writing performance than the students who are treated <b>by</b> <b>using</b> pictures. The mean of the students who write paragraph after being treated <b>by</b> <b>using</b> YouTube videos as authentic materials is lower than those who are treated <b>by</b> <b>using</b> pictures. This means that using pictures in writing are better than using YouTube videos to help the students in writing performance.  </p...|$|R
