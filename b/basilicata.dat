5|$|<b>Basilicata</b> {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Castellammare {{shipyard}} on 9 August 1913, {{the same day as}} Campania. Both ships were built on the same slipway. They were launched {{less than a year later}} on 23 July 1914. Fitting-out work proceeded more slowly on <b>Basilicata,</b> and she was completed on 1 August 1917, four months after her sister ship. After completion, <b>Basilicata</b> was stationed in Italian Libya. On 13 August 1919, while moored in Tewfik at the southern end of the Suez Canal, one of Basilicatas boilers exploded, which sank the ship. Salvage operations began thereafter, and on 12 September 1920, the ship was refloated. The Regia Marina decided that repairing the ship was not worth the cost, and so on 1 July 1921 she was sold to ship breakers in Suez.|$|E
5|$|Italy: M.alcathoe {{has been}} {{recorded}} in beech forest in Majella National Park {{in the region of}} Abruzzo. Additional specimens of M.alcathoe have been identified in Italy using molecular methods. In December 2013 its presence has been confirmed in the protected area of Appennino Lucano National Park (<b>Basilicata).</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Italy, living nativity scenes (presepe vivente) {{are extremely}} popular. They may be elaborate affairs, featuring {{not only the}} classic nativity scene but also a mock rural 19th-century village, complete with artisans in traditional costumes working at their trades. These attract many visitors and have been televised on RAI. In 2010, the old city of Matera in <b>Basilicata</b> hosted the world's largest living nativity scene of the time, which was performed in the historic center, Sassi.|$|E
5|$|Campania {{was built}} by the Castellammare shipyard, where her keel was laid on 9 August 1913, {{the same day as}} <b>Basilicata.</b> The ships were small enough that they could be built on the same slipway. They were {{launched}} {{less than a year later}} on 23 July 1914. After Fitting-out work was completed, Campannia was commissioned on 18 May 1917, four months before her sister ship. Designed as a colonial cruiser in the mold of the cruiser , Campania spent the first several years of her career in Italy's African colonies, including Italian Libya. On 1 July 1921, the ship was reclassified as a gunboat and two of her 152mm guns were removed during reconstruction work that lasted until 1922. Starting in 1932 she served as a school ship for naval cadets. She was capable of carrying 100cadets, along with their officers, petty officers, and support staff. She remained in this role until she was stricken from the naval register on 11 March 1937 and sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|Quantum of Solace {{was shot}} in six countries. Second unit filming began in Italy at the Palio di Siena horse race on 16 August 2007, {{although}} at that point Forster was unsure how it would fit into the film. Some scenes were filmed also in Maratea and Craco, two small distinctive towns in <b>Basilicata</b> in southern Italy. Other places used for location shooting were Madrid in August 2007; Baja California, Mexico in early 2008, for shots of the aerial battle; Malcesine, Limone sul Garda and Tremosine in Italy during March, and at Talamone during the end of April. The main unit began on 3 January 2008 at Pinewood Studios. The 007 Stage {{was used for the}} fight in the art gallery, and an MI6 safehouse hidden within the city's cisterns, while other stages housed Bond's Bolivian hotel suite, and the MI6 headquarters. Interior and exterior airport scenes were filmed at Farnborough Airfield and the snowy closing scenes were filmed at the Bruneval Barracks in Aldershot.|$|E
5|$|The last pair of {{protected}} cruisers {{built by the}} Italian Navy was intended for colonial service, and were based on experience from Calabria. They were given a relatively heavy main battery for their small size and a long cruising range, {{at the expense of}} armor protection and speed. The ships were so small that they could be built on the same slipway and launched the same day. Since they had been launched less than a week before hostilities broke {{out at the end of}} July 1914, fitting-out work was delayed by a steel shortage, particularly after Italy entered the war. Campania and <b>Basilicata</b> initially served in Libya; neither had eventful careers. The latter vessel was destroyed by a boiler explosion in Tewfik on 13 August 1919. Campania was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 and became a training ship in 1932. She ultimately was sold for scrap in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Byzantium {{had been}} {{absent from the}} affairs of {{southern}} Italy for almost a century, but the accession of Basil the Macedonian changed this: from 868 on, the imperial fleet and diplomacy were employed {{in an effort to}} secure the Adriatic Sea from Saracen raids, re-establish Byzantine dominance over Dalmatia, and extend Byzantine control once more over parts of Italy. Otranto was taken from the Saracens in 873, and Bari in 876. According to the Byzantine sources, during his tenure in Italy Nikephoros recovered numerous towns taken by the Arabs in the previous years, including Taranto, Bari, Santa Severina, Rhegion and Taormina, Tropai and especially Amantia, which Maxentios had previously attacked without success. According to the continuators of Georgios Monachos, he was besieging Amantia when news came of Emperor Basil's death and his own recall by Leo VI; Nikephoros kept the news a secret until he had persuaded the Arab garrison to surrender on guarantee of safe passage. During his time in Italy he also took steps to strengthen the Byzantine position by settling many Armenians in the region, as well as 1,000 manumitted slaves donated by Emperor Basil's old benefactor, the widow Danielis. The 11th-century historian John Skylitzes furthermore reports that Nikephoros brought an end to abuse against the local population, by ending the practice of returning Byzantine soldiers carrying off local Italians to be sold off in the East as slaves. According to Skylitzes, the grateful Italians dedicated a church in his honour. By the time of his departure, he had extended Byzantine control over most of Apulia and Calabria. These victories were followed up by his successors and laid the foundation of a resurgence of Byzantine power in southern Italy, culminating in the establishment of the theme of Longobardia in ca. 892. The regions of Apulia, Calabria and <b>Basilicata</b> would remain firmly under Byzantine control until the 11th century.|$|E

25|$|Upon arrival Crocco was {{captured}} by papal troops in Veroli and imprisoned in Rome. He was then {{turned over to the}} Italian authorities and sentenced to death on 11 September 1872 in Potenza, but the sentence was commuted to hard labour for life. He was imprisoned on Santo Stefano Island, where he began writing his memoirs, with the help of Eugenio Massa, captain of the royal army, which published them in 1903, under the name Gli ultimi briganti della <b>Basilicata</b> (The last brigands of <b>Basilicata).</b> The manuscript was republished in the post-World War II era by other authors like Tommaso Pedio (1963), Mario Proto (1994) and Valentino Romano (1997). Crocco was later transferred to the prison at Portoferraio, where he died on 18 June 1905.|$|E

In 1418, he married Polissena Ruffo, a Calabrese noblewoman.|$|E
25|$|The bulk {{of today}} Italy was {{inhabited}} by Italic tribes who occupied the modern regions of Lazio, Umbria, Marche, Abruzzo, Molise, Campania, <b>Basilicata,</b> Calabria, Apulia and Sicily. Sicily, {{in addition to}} having an Italic population in the Sicels, also was inhabited by the Sicani and the Elymians, of uncertain origin. The Veneti, most often regarded as an Italic tribe, chiefly inhabited the Veneto, but extended as far east as Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Istria, and had colonies as far south as Lazio.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2013, Italy had 60,782,668 inhabitants. The {{resulting}} population density, at , {{is higher}} than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of <b>Basilicata</b> and the island of Sardinia are very sparsely populated.|$|E
25|$|The Remedello, Rinaldone and Gaudo {{cultures}} are late Neolithic cultures of Italy, traces {{of which are}} primarily found in the present-day regions of Lombardy, Tuscany, Latium and Campania. They are sometimes described as Eneolithic cultures, due to their use of primitive copper tools. Other importants eneolithic cultures of the peninsula and the islands, often related to those previously mentioned, are the Laterza culture in Apulia and <b>Basilicata,</b> the Abealzu-Filigosa culture in Sardinia, the Conelle-Ortucchio culture in Abruzzo and Marche, the Serraferlicchio culture in Sicily, and the Spilamberto group in Emilia-Romagna.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} independently and shot in Italy, primarily at Cinecitt√† Studios in Rome, {{in the old}} city of Matera, and in the ghost town of Craco (<b>Basilicata).</b> The estimated US$30 million production cost, plus an additional estimated $15 million in marketing costs, were fully borne by Gibson and his company, Icon Productions. According to the DVD Special Feature, Martin Scorsese had recently finished his film, Gangs of New York, and Gibson and his production designers constructed part of their set using Scorsese's set. This saved Gibson {{a lot of time}} and money.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{communities}} {{lived in}} Sicily and Southern Italy for over 15 centuries but in 1492 King FerdinandII of Aragon proclaimed the Edict of expulsion. At their height, Jewish Sicilians probably constituted around one {{tenth of the}} island's population. After the Edict they partially converted to Christianity and some moved to Ottoman Empire and other places in Southern Italy, Rome and Europe. In the 19th century, street musicians from <b>Basilicata</b> began to roam worldwide to seek a fortune, most of them would become professional instrumentalists in symphonic orchestras, especially in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Dante Mario Antonio Caputo {{was born}} in Buenos Aires to parents from the Viggianello <b>Basilicata</b> Region of Italy. He {{graduated}} in {{political science at the}} Universidad del Salvador in Buenos Aires in 1966, and subsequently completed a graduate degree at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Between 1968 and 1972, he held various posts at the Organization of American States, and in 1972, earned doctorate in Sociology at the University of Paris. In 1973 he was appointed as an investigator at the Torcuato di Tella Institute and for six years he headed the centre of investigations on state and administration.|$|E
25|$|Campania and <b>Basilicata</b> {{were small}} {{enough that they}} could be built on the same slipway, and they were {{launched}} on the same day. They were the last protected cruisers to be built by the Regia Marina. This was partly a result of the outbreak of World War I during the construction of these ships, and the resulting shortage of steel as resources were dedicated to the construction of smaller scouts, destroyers, and submarines, which proved to be more useful in the confined waters of the Adriatic Sea. After the war, Italy received several light cruisers as war prizes from Germany and Austria-Hungary, and these ships formed the backbone of the Italian reconnaissance force in the immediate post-war period.|$|E
25|$|Around 530 BC {{he arrived}} in the Greek colony of Croton (today's Crotone, in Calabria) {{in what was then}} Magna Graecia. There he founded his own {{philosophical}} school the members of which he engaged to a disciplined and simple way of life (the Pythagorean way of life) as well as to mutual loyalty. He furthermore acquired some political influence, on Greeks and non-Greeks of the region. Following a conflict with the neighbouring colony of Sybaris, internal discord drove most of the Pythagoreans out of Croton. Pythagoras left the city before the outbreak of civil unrest and moved to Metapontum (today's Metaponto, in <b>Basilicata),</b> where he stayed {{for the rest of his}} life. After his death, his house was transformed into a sanctuary of Demeter, out of veneration for the philosopher, by the local population.|$|E
25|$|R1 (36.76%), J (29.65%), E1b1b (18.21%), I (7.62%), G (5.93%), T (5.51%), Q (2.54%). R1 and I haplogroups {{are typical}} in West European populations while J and E1b1b consist of {{lineages}} with differential distribution within Middle East, North Africa and Europe. Normans, Swabians, and other Germanic peoples left a contribution of around 8% on the paternal side (Haplogroup I). A recent genetic study of Southern Italian and Sicilian populations {{has shown that}} Sicilians are very similar in genetic makeup to mainlander Italians from the adjacent regions of Calabria, <b>Basilicata</b> and Apulia. Outside of Italy, according to one study, Greeks from Crete, Laconia, and Peloponese are genetically closest to Sicilians. According to another study, Sicilians were closest to other southern Italians and Greeks from Crete and the Aegean islands, but distinct from all mainland Greeks.|$|E
25|$|Coppola {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, to father Carmine Coppola (1910‚Äì1991), a flautist with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and mother Italia Coppola (n√©e Pennino; 1912‚Äì2004). Coppola is the middle of three children: his older brother was August Coppola, his younger sister is actress Talia Shire. Born into a family of Italian {{immigrant}} ancestry, his paternal grandparents came to the United States from Bernalda, <b>Basilicata.</b> His maternal grandfather, popular Italian composer Francesco Pennino, immigrated from Naples, Italy. Coppola received his middle name in honor of Henry Ford, not only because he {{was born in}} the Henry Ford Hospital but also because of his musician-father's association with the automobile manufacturer. At the time of Coppola's birth, his father was a flautist as well as arranger and assistant orchestra director for The Ford Sunday Evening Hour, an hour-long concert music radio series sponsored by the Ford Motor Company. Two years after Coppola's birth, his father was named principal flautist for the NBC Symphony Orchestra and the family moved to New York, settling in Woodside, Queens, where Coppola spent the remainder of his childhood.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} on 8 December 65 BC in the Samnite south of Italy. His home town, Venusia, lay on a trade route in the border region between Apulia and Lucania (<b>Basilicata).</b> Various Italic dialects were spoken {{in the area and}} this perhaps enriched his feeling for language. He could have been {{familiar}} with Greek words even as a young boy and later he poked fun at the jargon of mixed Greek and Oscan spoken in neighbouring Canusium. Literary Latin must have sounded to him like a semi-foreign language, heard only at school. One of the works he probably studied in school was the Odyssia of Livius Andronicus, crammed into Italian boys with threats and floggings by teachers like the 'Orbilius' mentioned in one of his poems. School was made particularly irksome by a number of his fellow pupils, the overgrown sons of beefy centurions. The army veterans could have been settled there at the expense of local families uprooted by Rome as punishment for their part in the Social War (91‚Äì88 BC). Such state-sponsored migration must have added still more linguistic variety to the area. According to a local tradition reported by Horace, a colony of Romans or Latins had been installed in Venusia after the Samnites had been driven out early in the third century. In that case, young Horace could have felt himself to be a Roman though there are also indications that he regarded himself as a Samnite or Sabellus by birth. Italians in modern and ancient times have always been devoted to their home towns, even after success in the wider world, and Horace was no different. Images of his childhood setting and references to it are found throughout his poems.|$|E
