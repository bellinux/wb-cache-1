25|$|In addition, Muskegon also berths the S.S. Milwaukee Clipper, {{a former}} car ferry that {{traveled}} {{the same route}} as Lake Express does today. The ship (which is a National Historic Landmark) {{is in the middle}} of a long process of being restored to its original form, but in the meantime is open for tours and hosts a museum aboard the vessel with information on both the Milwaukee Clipper, as well as the history of maritime in Muskegon. Muskegon is an historical port for commerce and lake travel. The lumbering era through World War II was its busiest historical use. Its image as a port the city has embraced with the local nickname 'The Port City'. It possesses a fine deep-water port and still functions delivering <b>bulk</b> <b>cement,</b> aggregate, and large cargoes to several lakeshore facilities, also coal to the B.C. Cobb power plant, an outdated coal-burning facility due to shut down.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Nada moved to Europe, setting in Austria, {{and began working}} with a cheese factory in Graz. In 1961, {{a close friend of}} Nada's invited him to Libya where a {{construction}} boom was developing. Nada seized on the occasion and started to spend his time between Libya and Austria. In {{a matter of a few}} years he became the largest supplier of cement to the North African country. The activity led him to partner with Cementir, the Italian cement maker, to develop in 1965 the world's first floating cement silos, two barges named GI-1 and GD-2 able to store <b>bulk</b> <b>cement</b> and loaded with bagging facilities. Cement soon became his main business along with smaller operations in other commodities ranging from steel to agricultural materials. Nada had tremendous business success in his ventures with Saudi Arabia, Libya and eventually, the Nigerian government.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research work is to develop and evaluate a fabrication procedure that enables a degree {{of control over the}} surface and sub-surface grain orientation texture of spark plasma sintered carbides and to investigate its effects on the hardness and abrasion resistance of the material. The composite material used in this investigation is a mixture of tungsten carbide (90 % WC) and cobalt (10 % Co) powders. The fabrication procedure predominantly involves mixing measured weight fractions of WC and Co powders with a temporary binder (polyvinyl alcohol) so that the mixture is malleable into thin sheets, and then subjecting these to multiple high-pressure rolling operations ? subjecting these sheets to high-pressure rolling is primarily responsible for partially ?aligning? the grains {{in order to have a}} dominant orientation. From these sheets, a number of discs were cut, stacked, thermally de-bound (to remove the temporary binder), and then spark plasma sintered to obtain <b>bulk</b> <b>cemented</b> WC-Co samples. The relationships between the degree of orientation texture and the fabrication process conditions were investigated through X-ray diffraction (XRD). Certain mechanical properties of the samples were then characterized, including indentation hardness testing and scratch testing using a diamond engraver, in order to evaluate their comparative hardness and abrasion resistance. Manipulating the grain orientation texture in this manner thus has potential to enable a level of control over numerous mechanical properties of WC-Co hard-material composites...|$|R
