Barbauld's father prompted many such tributes, although Lucy Aikin described him as excessively modest and reserved. Barbauld developed a strong bond with her brother during childhood, standing in as a mother figure to him; they eventually became literary partners. In 1817, Joanna Baillie commented of their relationship [...] "How few brothers and sisters have been to one another what they have <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> long a course of years!" ...|$|E

500|$|On December 27, 2009, Kariya {{received}} {{the sixth and}} last concussion of his NHL career, an elbow to the head delivered from behind by Buffalo Sabres' forward Patrick Kaleta. During what would become Kariya's last season in the NHL, the League began expanding their efforts to eliminate hits to the head with new rules and stiffer penalties. League officials also began looking to penalize [...] "blindside hits," [...] defined as a bodycheck against a player from the side, where he cannot see the ensuing player coming. At the time, Kariya called the pending rule changes [...] "long overdue," [...] adding that, [...] "hav <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> much with that...It's something that should've been in place years and years ago." ...|$|E

500|$|Square Enix {{had changed}} its mind, {{and no longer}} liked the Nordic style of this {{spin-off}} game, so a last-minute style change was attempted. [...] The game {{had been such a}} well-guarded secret, and had <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> many changes, that most employees did not know they had been working on a Final Fantasy game until very late in development. Grin attempted to change the art style to fit more with traditional Final Fantasy games, but still did not receive any positive feedback. In response, Grin sent Square Enix an image of one of the latter's own games, Final Fantasy XII, and were told that it does not look like a game in Final Fantasys style. Following that exchange, Grin {{came to the conclusion that}} there was no longer any way to satisfy the publisher.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{talks about the}} healing effect of love. In an article for Bustle, Danielle Jackson presumed it to be love from her fans who had {{supported}} Gaga throughout her career. While performing [...] "The Cure" [...] at 'Coachella', the singer said to the crowd: [...] "I love you guys so much. I have <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> much {{in my life and}} I've seen so much. And you cure me every time with your love." [...] The dedication-like lyrics begins with the singer comparing her music as an escape route for her fans. This is expanded upon in the chorus when Gaga belts [...] "If I can't find the cure, I'll, I'll fix you with my love", thus positioning herself as someone who advocates for the troubling time in anyone's life, evident by the closing line [...] "Promise I'll always be there, Promise I'll be the cure". Ally Hirschalg from Mic also found other explanations from the lyrics: a mother talking to her children and someone who had a recent break-up, the latter alluding to Gaga's break-up with fiancee Taylor Kinney the previous year.|$|E

[...] Of its appeal Garrett {{said that it would}} have the effect of [...] "Yeah!", and called the song an [...] "explosive record". Garrett went on to say, [...] "I definitely feel it's what Usher's been wanting to say. But at the same time, it's {{what a lot of people}} wanted to say, they just didn't know what to say." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News said that [...] "Usher pulls back the curtain, revealing that a rumored rift between him and his mother was very real", and the song could be heard as an [...] "postmortem" [...] on his marriage, through the lines, [...] "For you I gave my heart and turned my back against the world/ 'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl, I done damn near lost my mama, I done <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> much drama/ I done turned into the man I never thought I'd be/ I'm ready to sign them papers." ...|$|E

500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E
500|$|Metcalfe {{spoke of}} the new storyline, saying how [...] "honoured" [...] she was {{to take part in}} the storyline as well as praising the writer, Anna Clements: [...] "I'm honoured to have been given this storyline to raise {{awareness}} of such an important cause. Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through." [...] Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at Sands, said: [...] "We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy that can happen to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them." [...] Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had [...] "a lump in my throat", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was [...] "sat their sobbing". She continued to say: [...] "When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words." [...] before praising the script writing, calling them [...] "brilliant" [...] and stating she did not have to work hard to find the [...] "level of emotion", [...] "The words were all there on the page. I broke down every time." ...|$|E

Marissa's relationships with her parents, boyfriends, and classmates are often tumultuous. She is Summer's best friend and Ryan's on and off love interest. Marissa is portrayed as a [...] "spoiled girl who adjusts to being poor." [...] The casting director referred to Marissa as [...] "a girl stuck in the trappings of her life who seemed older than her actual age." [...] Mischa Barton left the series {{at the end of}} season three when her character was subsequently written off by being killed in a car accident.

2500|$|The Coens' {{script was}} mostly {{faithful}} to the source material. On their writing process, Ethan said, [...] "One of us types into the computer while the other holds {{the spine of the}} book open flat." [...] Still, they pruned where necessary. A teenage runaway who appeared late in the book and some backstory related to Bell were both removed. Also changed from the original was Carla Jean Moss's reaction when finally faced with the imposing figure of Chigurh. As explained by Kelly Macdonald, [...] "the ending of the book is different. She reacts more in the way I react. She kind of falls apart. In the film she's <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> much and she can't lose any more. It's just she's got this quiet acceptance of it." [...] In the book, there is also some attention paid to the daughter, Deborah, whom the Bells lost and who haunts the protagonist in his thoughts.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 September 2008, Quo Vadis {{played a}} concert at The Medley in Montreal, at which Stéphane Paré {{confirmed}} that Yanic and {{him would be}} leaving the band, leaving Bart as the only original member still left in the band. Bart speculated that {{the distance between the}} band and Yanic contributed to his departure; [...] "With regard to Yanic, I know {{it was a very difficult}} decision to make on his part. People change, priorities change, personal situations change and he's been flying in from Tennessee for all the shows so you can imagine with the recent developments in the US/gas prices/travel and the fact that we were working remotely on the new record had probably something to do with it. I guess sometimes you have to make difficult decisions and this one was Yanic's. For sure on my end I will miss him on stage and working with him because he's been like a brother to me for 15 years and we've <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> much together." [...] At the same show, Bart's right knee, which had both ligaments torn away in a sports injury, gave in completely and he supported his entire weight on his left knee for the rest of the show. However, this was to no avail as eventually Rob [...] "The Witch" [...] from Necronomicon and Stephane from BCI had to carry Bart around for the rest of the set, eventually having him sit up on a chair for the remainder of the show. Stéphane proposed cutting the show short but Bart refused and played on till the end. In the following months, both his knees had to have surgery.|$|E
2500|$|Nancy's {{hair has}} {{dominated}} her many styles {{and she has}} had several different hair colours. When asked about her character's [...] "crazy" [...] hair styles Fox revealed that the ideas for the styles are a collaboration of her own ideas and the production teams': [...] "I had a brown bob forever and I was sick to death of it, so when {{we came out of}} the Jake storyline last year, they wanted to change the image. They asked me if I wanted to dye it any colour, so I thought 'let's go red'". Fox said that her initial Hollyoaks image featuring green hair was [...] "definitely not a good look". She added that during her tenura Nancy has had a [...] "few hair disasters", especially the in between stages when she [...] "went back to black from red and then to blonde". She said that since her character has <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> much she no longer feels it necessary to [...] "desperately shock" [...] everyone with her hair styles as she has had to grow up and evolve. Fox said she enjoys Nancy's style which has [...] "evolved" [...] as she has [...] "been a Goth, she’s been a New Romantic and now I like to call her Dusty Springfield on acid! It’s a bit Duffy, a bit ’50s-style, and now I’ve got the red hair it gives us more to play with". Fox added that [...] "one of my favourite things about being in a soap for a long time - I do get to change my image a lot". She said that she enjoys the feedback she receives from her style changes and when her latest style was aired and she had [...] "cut it into a short bob, I got so many tweets from people - some negative, but mostly positive thankfully". She said that she would be open to changing her image in future. Fox has also commented on Nancy's large tattoo on her back, which she deemed to be [...] "too masculine". Fox said that when she was initially on the serial she found it [...] "great to be different" [...] but felt that it was difficult playing the [...] "alternative" [...] character of Nancy when her colleagues were such [...] "gorgeous, glamourous women". The tattoo has since disappeared. Of the character's dress sense the Hollyoaks wardrobe department said [...] "Nancy Hayton has a unique distinctive look on Hollyoaks. She wears rich colours and vibrant patterns, which compliment [...] her slim shape".|$|E
