Since the functions were similar to Bearer cheques, it was in regular use as prices continue to rise. These cheques also carried time limits and limited security features. In the final months of the second dollar, the $200000 cheque was the lowest legal tender denomination by decree, despite having its expiry date extended twice. The $100000000 <b>Bearer</b> <b>Cheque</b> would have been the lowest legal tender denomination in circulation had the expiry dates of currency cheques been enforced without extension, with the $100 billion Agro Cheque being the highest whether or not the $200000 note was legal tender.|$|E

50|$|Inflation, at 164.3% in June 2005, {{increased}} to 254.8% in July 2005, creating a speed-bump {{on the road}} to the government's goal of bringing inflation down to 80% by year end. Murerwa recently presented a supplementary budget to pay wages, import food and build new housing, after admitting that targets for economic growth and inflation would be missed. Inflation was at 1193% in July 2006 making it the highest inflation rate in the world outside the war zones. Many people viewed Murerwa as the reason why the Zimbabwean economy was struggling due to his 'yes my lord' approach towards President Robert Mugabe. This was aggravated by the fact that he opposed the currency reforms initiated by Gideon Gono, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe director, in August 2006. Before that Murerwa wanted to introduce $250,000 <b>bearer</b> <b>cheque</b> during the absence of Gono which would have fuelled the inflation rate further only to be stopped by Mugabe.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} trial Gatty served as {{secretary}} to the Chief Ministerial Whip, T. E. Ellis. Between 1898 and 1905 Gatty was joint editor, with the Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk, of the hymnal Arundel Hymns, to which Pope Leo XIII contributed a preface in form of a personal letter. When George Wyndham served as Chief Secretary for Ireland between November 1900 and March 1905, art dealer and collector Hugh Lane corresponded with Gatty about meeting with Wyndham; Gatty's reply in 1903 [...] "advising patience" [...] survives. That same year Gatty was invited by Wyndham {{to stay at the}} Chief Secretary's Lodge. In 1904 he returned to Dublin and founded the Irish Art Companions with the involvement of the wealthy Irish American nationalist Thomas Hughes Kelly. The Irish Art Companions was run by Gatty, a member of the Conradh na Gaeilge (Gaelic League) that sponsored the 'Industrial Conference' in November 1905, at which Gatty delivered a speech on 'Industrial Development'. The Art Companions aligned themselves with the cultural nationalism of the League and played an active part in the artistic life of Dublin, in 1906 Gatty stated that the Art Companions wanted [...] "a re-evaluation of this country in the estimation of its own children" [...] On May 4, 1906 he gave a lecture at Westminster Hall on [...] "the revival of sacred and other Arts in Ireland". The Art Companions opened a sales depot to store and exhibit works in adjoining 18th Century houses at 27 - 28 Clare St not far from the School of Art, the building also housed a plaster mill. By 1907 this was described as [...] "a manufactory, technical college, art school and shop all in one". Between 4 May and 9 November 1907 members of the Irish Arts Companions exhibited at the Irish International Exhibition. A branch was then opened in London in 1908, which was managed by Charles H Cochrane. Among those associated with the Art Companions were the Irish republican sculptor Willie Pearse, sculptor and portrait painter Lilla Vanston, sculptor, medallist Gwendolen Herbert and sculptor, painter Mervyn Lawrence whose work was owned by Lady Fingal Elizabeth Burke-Plunkett who knew Gatty and was an activist in Irish industrial, cultural and charitable groups. A factory was also set up at Ringsend to manufacture plaster from Irish gypsum. The Art Companions also helped provide an alternative to imported ecclesiastical statues. A letter exists from the Irish Art Companions to Patrick Pearse dated March 7, 1910 asking him to [...] "give <b>bearer</b> <b>cheque</b> as promised". The letter is written on headed paper : Irish Art CompanionsEverything Sold in this Shop has been made in Ireland by Irish hands. The Irish Art Companions also sold clothing and advertised 'Irish Costume Material' {{on the front page of}} Bean na hÉireann (The Women of Ireland) a magazine run by the Inghinidhe na hÉireann the Irish radical women's movement founded by Maud Gonne; and in January 1912 in the An Claidheamh Soluis an advert promoting [...] "Irish Linens, Dress Materials, Colleen Cloaks and Underwear".|$|E
50|$|In 1879, the {{government}} introduced notes for 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 soles. In 1881, 5 and 100 incas notes were overprinted with the denominations 50 and 1000 soles. In 1914, <b>bearer</b> <b>cheques</b> were introduced for ½, 1, 5 and 10 libras (5, 10, 50 and 100 soles). 1 sol cheques were issued in 1918 whilst, in 1917, gold certificates for 5 and 50 centavos and 1 sol were issued. In 1922, the Reserve Bank of Peru took over paper money production, issuing a final series of libra notes.|$|R
5000|$|A third redenomination, {{producing}} the [...] "fourth Zimbabwe dollar," [...] occurred in February 2009, and dropped 12 more zeros from the currency. It was thus worth 10 trillion trillion original dollars, {{as the three}} redenominations together reduced {{the value of an}} original dollar by 103 × 1010 × 1012 = 1025. Computers could not handle the amount of zeros such that other forms of money had to be used to act as normal money (<b>bearer’s</b> <b>cheques).</b> Banks had to input a lesser amount on the deposit or withdrawal slip then would put a covering statement, such as “multiply by 1000 000 or add 10 zeros to your amount to get the real value”.

40|$|Processing cheques {{manually}} is {{been done}} {{for decades and}} more efficient systems are still under research. In this entire processing system, providing a secured transaction with efficient verification is what more important. An instance cheque clearance system is proposed comprising of an unmanned customer and an operator station, and means for providing communication with secure transaction. The customer station includes an OMR scanner to scan a given cheque and a cash dispenser to withdraw the cash. Secure means are provided for enabling the operator to verify {{the identity of the}} <b>cheque</b> <b>bearer</b> by recognizing MICR number, Cheque number, Signature and amount through various techniques. This will be later implemented through MATLAB[Matrix Laboratory]. OCR[Optical Character Recognition] is a method of verifying the cheque number,amount and the MICR [Magnetic Ink Character Recognition] number. Our main aim is to detect whether the cheque is valid or not by verifying the signature and account payee which can be validated using binarization. For customer the signature is fed into the process in which the original images are resized to a specified size and there images are converted to binary values which will be compared with the original signature stored in the bank database. A secret pin number is given by the <b>cheque</b> <b>bearer</b> to check drawer for a secure transaction. The validation process is done using java. This pin number is generated from a kit where the secret number for each cheque is has been saved in a PIC microcontroller as well as the bank database. A keypad is connected to an LCD [Liquid Crystal Display] to which the user can type the cheque number and view its corresponding PIN number in the display. Once the PIN number is verified in the cheque station then the amount can be withdrawn or transacted at the same moment by the user...|$|R
