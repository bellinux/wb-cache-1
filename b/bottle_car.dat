50|$|Notable {{examples}} are El Chino Ántrax and Claudia Ochoa Felix, supposed leaders of Los Ántrax, an enforcer gang of the Sinaloa cartel. Both {{captured the attention}} of news outlets and blogs with photos on Twitter and Instagram that showed how they enjoy the sort of spoils that Mexicans relate with the lives of successful drug traffickers. Claudia posts pictures on social media, as which she poses with expensive accessories like watches, purses, designer clothes, champagne <b>bottles,</b> <b>cars</b> and planes. Also frequently poses with big guns. In a press release, she mentions how her life has changed after those pictures have circulated around the world, and she fears for her family's safety. She claims that all those pictures of her were modified, because she is not the one appearing in them. She also claims that she has no association whatsoever with any of the drug cartels operating in Mexico.|$|R

50|$|Another {{problem is}} garbage that has {{accumulated}} in the bay. Although 60.65 tons {{have recently been}} extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, {{more needs to be}} done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer <b>bottles</b> and <b>car</b> tires.|$|R

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{constellation}} model to include heterogeneous parts which may represent either the appearance or {{the geometry of}} a region of the object. The pans and their spatial configuration are learnt simultaneously and automatically, without supervision, from cluttered images. We describe how this model can be employed for ranking the output of an image search engine when searching for object categories. It is shown that visual consistencies in the output images can be identified, and then used to rank the images according to their closeness to the visual object category. Although the proportion of good images may be small, the algorithm {{is designed to be}} robust and is capable of learning in either a totally unsupervised manner, or with a very limited amount of supervision. We demonstrate the method on image sets returned by Google's image search for a number of object categories including <b>bottles,</b> camels, <b>cars,</b> horses, tigers and zebras...|$|R

5000|$|Hayssam {{was arrested}} in Romania on April 5, 2005. Prosecutors charged him and Mohammad Munaf, the journalists' Iraqi guide and Hayssam's {{business}} partner, with organizing the abduction to help Hayssam escape organized crime charges. According to the prosecutors, Hayssam organized the kidnapping because he was being investigated in several cases of financial fraud, and {{was looking for a}} way to leave the country with a large sum of money. His businesses included mineral water <b>bottling,</b> shops, a <b>car</b> dealership and manufacturing. Romanian media speculated that Hayssam had hoped prosecutors would drop the organized crime charges when he presented himself as a go-between. He would then unblock his bank accounts, which had been frozen as part of the financial investigation, pay a fictitious ransom, and become a [...] "national hero" [...] when the hostages were released.|$|R
40|$|The {{radiological}} {{determination of}} foreign objects in corpses {{can be difficult}} if they are fragmented or deformed. With multislice computed tomography, radiodensities [...] referred to as Hounsfield units (HU) [...] can be measured. We examined the possibility of differentiating 21 frequently occurring foreign bodies, such as metals, rocks, and different manmade materials {{by virtue of their}} HU values. Gold, steel, and brass showed mean HU values of 30671 - 30710 (upper measurable limit), mean HU values for steel, silver, copper, and limestone were 20346, 16949, 14033, and 2765, respectively. The group consisting of objects, such as aluminum, tarmac, car front-window glass, and other rocks, displayed mean HU values of 2329 - 2131 HU. The mean HU value of <b>bottle</b> glass and <b>car</b> side-window glass was 2088, whereas windowpane glass was 493. HU value determination may therefore help in preautopsy differentiation between case-relevant and irrelevant foreign bodies and thus be useful for autopsy planning and extraction of the objects in question...|$|R
40|$|S. C. Prometalex S. A. is a {{teaching}} case concerning a newly privatised Romanian producer of food process and bottling systems that ventured into making hydraulic car lifts after highly disappointing {{sales in the}} newly privatised company. The venture involved the selection of off-shore suppliers for three major subcomponents: hydraulic pumps, electronic controls and hydraulic cylinders. Prometalex was not satisfied with Romanian suppliers and searched for offshore suppliers. The Prometalex managers experienced an intensive self-taught lesson in supplier selection. Their decision was based on quality, price, delivery and payment conditions. Small volume and offshore supply constraints, however, led to costs that would hurt profitability as Prometalex {{was about to begin}} volume production of the lifts. The opportunity to source from a new Romanian supplier was a welcome development but supply uncertainty was a major barrier.

50|$|Police {{responded to}} {{complaints}} about loud noise and drug use. As {{news of the}} concert spread, motorcycles, along with some cars and pick-up trucks, began illegally parking on a section of grass {{that had previously been}} used as an overflow parking area. The conflict began when police ordered people to remove these vehicles from the grass. Tensions escalated after officers who responded to the complaints saw an individual dispensing beer from the back of a pick-up truck. A combination of the people's refusal to disperse, the confrontation with the owner of the pick-up, {{and the fact that the}} officers were greatly outnumbered caused the officers to call for reinforcements. The second wave of police launched tear gas canisters into the crowd. Many children were present and were overcome with the gas. In retaliation, some in the crowd began throwing rocks and <b>bottles.</b> A police <b>car</b> was overturned. In panic, many of the concert-goers fled into the surrounding residential area and were sheltered for several hours by local residents.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{its history}} H&B {{provided}} training for {{many young men}} in the trade. None more notable than John Halewood - although John recalled that his own ‘training’ amounted {{to no more than}} being given six <b>bottles</b> of sherry, <b>car</b> keys, a price list and a map of Yorkshire. In 1997 he returned to buy the firm during a period of rapid expansion of his Halewood Group. John was born on the Wirral in Wallasey to an Irish mother Eileen, and a father who was a naval officer and engineer. Both helped John when he eventually set up his own business as a ‘one-man band’. John’s mother Eileen Halewood was a director and shareholder of the business until her death, aged 87, in 2010. Although the business has grown organically, strategic purchases have also been a feature of the development, with two other Merseyside businesses being absorbed along the way: John Buccleugh, which was based in Kirkby, (to be more precise it was the equipment that was situated at John Buccleugh’s in Kirkby which was bought by Halewood International, not the business), and Lamb & Watt, a Warrington-based drinks company founded as long ago as 1847.|$|R
5000|$|The {{winemaker}} {{has also}} used the popular James Bond film series as a marketing device. In the 1973 film Live and Let Die, James Bond (played by Roger Moore) is heard asking {{for a bottle of}} Bollinger after entering his hotel. In the 1985 film A View to a Kill, James Bond recognizes the champagne served {{at the top of the}} Eiffel Tower as [...] "Bollinger, 1975." [...] In the 1987 film The Living Daylights, James Bond (played by Timothy Dalton) delivers a gift basket to General Koskov who, seeing the champagne, exclaims [...] "Bollinger R.D....The Best!" [...] In the 2002 film Die Another Day, James Bond (played by Pierce Brosnan) is heard asking for a bottle of 1961 Bollinger immediately after being released from a North Korean prison. In The World Is Not Enough, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) beds the female lead alongside an iced bottle of Bollinger. In the 2006 film Casino Royale, James Bond (played by Daniel Craig) also requests a bottle of Bollinger. There is also a <b>bottle</b> in his <b>car</b> at the end of the car chase at the start of GoldenEye.|$|R
40|$|Background: Typography plays {{a natural}} and {{important}} role in creative design. Playing with fonts is among the first things young children do when exploring the uses of a word processing program. Adults and design aficionados often mock {{the use of a}} font such as Comic Sans (e. g. Barcelona’s soccer team using that typeface on their shirts) or the use of dull, business-like typefaces such as Arial or Times New Roman. Despite particular typefaces being singled out, most of a reader’s interactions with fonts are rather implicit. Still, font choices could have persuasive consequences thus rendering these choices strategic as well as creative. Method: Based on congruity theory (e. g., Yoon, 2013) and earlier research on fonts by Van Rompay and Pruyn (2011), we designed a 2 (product positioning: luxurious vs. casual) x 2 (typeface congruency: congruent vs. incongruent) x 2 (matching: congruency for water <b>bottles</b> vs. for <b>car</b> tires) mixed design with the first two variables manipulated within subjects and the latter between subjects. 98 adult participants completed the online experimental procedure in which they saw six advertisements of which four were target advertisements with manipulated fonts. Target advertisements were for water <b>bottle</b> brands and <b>car</b> tire brands and were pre-tested (n = 20) with respect to how casual versus luxurious they were perceived. Fonts were also pretested with respect to the same dimensions and Din and Counselor Script were chosen as target fonts. The original target advertisements were then manipulated such that the original tag line was replaced by a tag line in a manipulated font. Each participants saw one set of congruently advertised products and one set of incongruently advertised products. Participants provided ratings for each of the six shown advertisements concerning attitude towards the ad, brand credibility, and expected pricing. Afterwards, participants also engaged in a manipulation check of ad and font ratings. Results: Repeated measures ANOVAs on all three dependent variables produced similar results. Brands performed better when they were advertised with a congruency between the advertisement and the used typeface. This congruency benefit is most articulate for casual advertisements that particularly result in negative perceptions (attitudes, credibility, price) when they apply a luxurious font. The effects were also somewhat more articulate for the high involvement car tires than for the low involvement water bottles. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that subtle marketing cues, such as the used typeface in a print/banner advertisement, affect consumer responses through inferences with respect to the congruency between general ad image and typeface. Usually, such decisions like typeface are considered to be “mere creative” but evidence accumulates that they also bear strategic implications. status: publishe...|$|R
