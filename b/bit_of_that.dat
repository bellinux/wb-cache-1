Lynsey sees qualities in Mercy that she kind of wishes she had herself. Mercy’s very straight-talking, she’s quite ballsy and calls a spade a spade, and sometimes Lynsey wishes she had a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> gusto.

Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that would be my hope, that we get a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> happening again." ...|$|E

Robinson told Rap-Up, [...] "Keri Hilson has a great personality and is a real girl. That’s what we want to get across." [...] He also talked about the premise and plot of the video, stating that the video portrays Hilson as a woman who doesn't take herself seriously, commenting, [...] "It’s a really sexy song, but we don’t want to fall into the typical love, love, love R vibe with that... it starts where you think, ‘Oh, it’s about her and being sexy.' She’s in her house and by herself, and you kind of think it could be serious, but the song drops out in the middle and her friends catch her being all sexy, basically like, ‘What the f**k [...] are you doing? You are not singing by yourself.’" [...] In an interview with That Grape Juice, when asked about the video and on the sensuality of the live performances compared to video, Hilson responded, [...] "Yeah. It is a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> but it’s a bit toned down for the video, because you got so much censoring, I can’t do everything I do on stage (laughs). So when people come out they’re probably still gonna be a bit surprised to see it live, after seeing the video. But I’m very pleased with the video. I love the colours and it’s reminiscent of the whole late 70s early 80s era in music." [...] Chris Brown, Omarion, Monica, Melody Thornton, and Polow Da Don all appear in the video. The video begins with Hilson, dressed lavishly, arriving late to a Jeep full of the previous stated people. The clip flips back to what happened earlier that night, showing Hilson getting ready in a seductive fashion, as she chooses perfume and picks out clothes. Scenes of Hilson performing in front of a leather-like wall are interspersed in between her and her friends riding down a boulevard to the club. Once she arrives to the club, she is attracted to a particular man, and subsequently performs elaborate, sensual choreography with him and other dancers, before slow dancing. VIBE said, [...] "Keri Hilson is fine as wine. You know it. We know it. And she knows it. But for the doubters, she proves it once again with this seductive new video from In A Perfect World." [...] A writer for Rap-Up said that Hilson, [...] "takes it nice and slow in the video for 'Slow Dance.'" [...] The video ranked at number 80 on [...] Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E
