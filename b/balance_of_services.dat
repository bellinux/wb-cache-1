40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{delivery of}} multiple ecosystem services requires {{the management of}} functionally diverse biological communities. In an agricultural context, where conflicting services often need to be reconciled on the same parcel of land, growing species mixtures may improve multi-functionality when compared to monocultures. In this case, the optimum number and identity of species {{will be determined by}} trade-offs between ecosystem services, functional composition of the available species pool and competitive dynamics. A combination of functional trait / ecosystem service relationships and a process-based model of plant competition was used to engineer a plant community that delivered the optimal <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> using the case study of a legume-based fertility building cover crop. An experimental species pool of 12 cultivated legume species was screened for a range of functional traits and ecosystem services at five sites across a geographical gradient in the UK. All possible species combinations were then analysed to identify the community that delivered the best <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> at each site. In our system, low to intermediate levels of species richness (1 - 4 species) that exploited functional contrasts in growth habit and phenology, were identified as being optimal. The optimal solution was determined largely by the number of species and functional diversity represented by the starting species pool emphasising the importance of the initial selection of species for the screening experiments. The approach of applying functional traits / ecosystem service relationships to the design of multi-functional biological communities has the potential to inform the design of agricultural systems that better balance agronomic and environmental services and meet the current objective of European agricultural policy, to maintain viable food production {{in the context of the}} sustainable management of natural resources. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|E

After that, a practical algorithm for load balancing is developed which includes QoS-guaranteed hybrid scheduling, handover of users with and without QoS requirements, and call admission control. Simulation is made extensively and the results show that the proposed load balancing algorithm can significantly enhance the performance of LTE networks with heterogeneous services, decreasing call block probability of users with QoS requirements, and increasing throughput of boundary users with only a bit degradation of total throughput.

Three national surveys of the US household population (1979, 1984, and 1990) were used for trend analysis of treatment utilization. Trends in demographic characteristics of persons with lifetime treatment rates and particular types of treatment were examined by means of logistic regression analysis, controlling for alcohol problem severity and other variables. RESULTS. Substantial increases in the numbers reporting treatment were found. In all surveys, Alcoholics Anonymous was the treatment used most frequently and its use increased most, especially for women. Men were more likely than women (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 01, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 20, 5. 39) and unmarried persons were twice as likely as married persons to have been treated [corrected].

It {{describes how the}} merchandise trade balance has shifted in Malaysia’s favour, while the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> trade is again in Australia’s favour. Surprisingly, the level of Malaysian investment in Australia is significantly greater than Australia’s investment in Malaysia, which has fallen sharply since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. AUSTRALIAN-MALAYSIAN TRADE FLOWS Australia and Malaysia enjoy a strong trading relationship reflecting the complementary nature of the two economies. Bilateral merchandise trade reached A$ 8 billion in 2004, accounting for 3. 1 per cent of all Australian trade and ranking Malaysia as Australia’s ninth largest goods trading partner. Before the Asian financial crisis, the balance of merchandise trade was in Australia’s favour with rapid growth and a strong ringgit fuelling Malaysia’s import demand (Figure 1). However, the crisis shifted the trade balance in favour of Malaysia as domestic demand contracted sharply causing Australian exports to Malaysia to fall significantly during that period. While Australian exports have recovered from the crisis lows, the trade balance remains strongly in favour of Malaysia, largely reflecting its increased exports of information technology-related and petroleum products to Australia and strong growth in the Australian economy...|$|E

Not only did programmes that tended to be rated as high on realising one of these principles tend to score high on the others, making for essentially better and more poorly implemented programmes, but evidence emerged that better implemented programmes yielded somewhat greater benefits. While the evidence was not overwhelming, it was consistent with theory about the conditions under which programmes should prove most effective and provided guidance as to what it takes to generate the kinds of benefits that SSLPs were intended to achieve.|$|E

It is notably {{done by the}} application method of horizontal cutting of balance of payment, which offers a clear insight in the surplus and deficit components of balance, i. e. the ways of balancing its individual accounts. In addition to it, two criteria of how to classify balance on financial and capital account are applied – the term of payment criterion and solvency criterion. The use of the mentioned criteria resulted in difference of the long-term from short-term and solvent from non-solvent capital, which rendered possible to create additional conclusions regarding the financing of deficits {{in the balance of}} payment in the Republic of Croatia. In the course of the observed, the balance on the current account is in deficit, which is the consequence of balance of goods deficit and balance of incomes deficit. Although the Republic of Croatia realizes surplus in the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> and in the balance of current transfers these surpluses are not sufficient to equalize balance on the current account. Thus, finally the deficit is financed by the foreign exchange currency inflow based on the direct investments and foreign debt accumulation.

Clustering software is high-end software that has come to solve quite satisfactorily the problem of downtime with which large companies servicing time-sensitive applications had to confront in the past, in case of software or hardware component failures.

In this paper, a new multiobjective stochastic JRD (MSJRD) of the one-warehouse and n-retailer systems considering the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> level and total cost simultaneously is proposed. The goal of this problem is to decide the reasonable replenishment interval, safety stock factor, and traveling routing. Secondly, two approaches are designed to handle this complex multi-objective optimization problem. Linear programming (LP) approach converts the multi-objective to single objective, while a multi-objective evolution algorithm (MOEA) solves a multi-objective problem directly. Thirdly, three intelligent optimization algorithms, differential evolution algorithm (DE), hybrid DE (HDE), and genetic algorithm (GA), are utilized in LP-based and MOEA-based approaches. Results of the MSJRD with LP-based and MOEA-based approaches are compared by a contrastive numerical example.
