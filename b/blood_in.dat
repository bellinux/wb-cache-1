40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} supplementation of 3000 IU vitamin E on the {{concentration}} of vitamin E <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> and <b>in</b> the liver of heifers around parturition was measured in this experiment. We were also interested in the relation between cholesterol and vitamin E <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> and the relation between vitamin E <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> and <b>in</b> the liver. Starting 8 weeks prior to parturition until 8 weeks after parturition, 9 heifers were supplemented with vitamin E. Another group of 9 heifers were used as a control group. Both groups were held under the same conditions and were fed the same diet. Blood and liver samples were taken and {{the concentration of}} vitamin E (blood and liver), cholesterol (blood) and total protein (liver) were measured. The results show that supplementation of 3000 IU of vitamin E increases the concentration of vitamin E <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> and <b>in</b> the liver. It shows {{that there is a}} strong correlation between the concentration of vitamin E <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> and <b>in</b> the liver (R 2 : 0, 63; P < 0, 01). Supplementation also leads to an increased transport capacity (cholesterol) of vitamin E <b>in</b> <b>blood.</b> Supplementation of vitamin E increases the antioxidative capacity of blood and the liver. Supplementation might also reduce the risk for heifers to get mastitis...|$|R
5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> the urine, can occur secondary {{to a number}} of causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
