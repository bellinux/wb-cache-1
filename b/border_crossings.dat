5|$|LI Infantry Corps were {{tasked with}} attacking towards Maribor then driving towards Zagreb, while the XLIX Mountain Corps was to capture Dravograd then force a {{crossing}} on the Sava. At 05:00 on 6 April, LI Infantry Corps captured the Mura bridges at Mureck and Radkersburg (opposite Gornja Radgona) undamaged. In the {{sector of the}} 38th Infantry Division Dravska, one German column pushed towards Maribor from Mureck, and the other pushed on from Gornja Radgona through Lenart towards Ptuj. Some time later, other elements of LI Infantry Corps attacked the area between Sveti Duh and Dravograd. The 7th and 8th Border Regiments met these attacks with fierce resistance, but were forced to withdraw due to German pressure. The 183rd Infantry Division captured 300 prisoners, and a bicycle-mounted detachment of the division reached Murska Sobota without striking any resistance. The 132nd Infantry Division also pushed south along the Sejanski valley towards Savci. By {{the end of the}} first day, LI Infantry Corps had occupied Gornja Radgona, Murska Sobota and Radenci, and had crossed the Drava near Sveti Duh. XLIX Mountain Corps captured <b>border</b> <b>crossings</b> on the approaches to Dravograd, but were held up by the 6th Border Regiment in mountain passes located further west at Ljubelj, Jezerski vrh and Korensko sedlo. Late that day, mountain pioneers destroyed some isolated Yugoslav bunkers in the area penetrated by Kampfgruppe Palten.|$|E
50|$|On 17 August, Ukraine accused Russia {{of sending}} more {{military}} equipment, including Grad rocket launchers, {{across the border}} and on to Nizhny Nagolchyk. Sergei Lavrov continued to deny that Russia was sending any equipment across the border. He asserted that an OSCE observer mission placed at border crossing points in the region had not identified any unlawful <b>crossings</b> of the <b>border</b> but the OSCE mission that Lavrov mentioned had no mandate to check the long, unguarded sections of the <b>border</b> where <b>crossings</b> of men and equipment occurred frequently.|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean between <b>borders</b> and <b>crossings.</b> The {{writing of}} two shores: a {{comparison}} of the works of Giorgio Todde, Yasmina Khadra and Nourredine Saadi. The Mediterranean is a plural space, containing multiple cultural variations, where it is impossible to determine borders between the many diverse populations as their history and influences have always been entangled. Still, no one description of the people who inhabit this space could ever be enough to encompass their diversity which allows the question to be asked: has the concept of “Mediterranean” really ever existed? In the occidental world the existence of Mediterranean cuisine, climate, culture, etc. artificially “unite” and then reassemble this space ideologically in a way that reactivates its colonial history. Whereas in Arab literature the distinction between bahr al-Rum (sea of the Romans) and bahr al-Shamm (sea of Shamm, modern-day Syria and Lebanon), shows that conceptually there is a clear division between the two worlds. In that sense, the Mediterranean is much more of a crossroads between cultures, a space of intermediation, which defines itself through movement and exchange. The “object” in common between all the cultures involved is the sea, so that concept has evolved to represent <b>borders</b> and <b>crossings</b> simultaneously. This sea functions as a kind of “water mirror”, reflecting the images of others to provoke a questioning of identity and existing relationships. The works of Yasmina Khadra, Nourredine Saadi and Giorgio Todde, are particularly relevant in so far as they all describe this same space with their own differences; one highlighting the tragedy of the Algerian people, another illustrating a space that fluctuates between interior and exterior to be able to represent the difficult condition of entre deux, and the third representing a place of encounters and confrontation. ...|$|R

5|$|Late that day, {{mountain}} pioneers destroyed some isolated Yugoslav bunkers in {{the area}} penetrated by Kampfgruppe Palten, and German aircraft again attacked the 7th Army's air reconnaissance assets {{on the ground at}} Cerklje, destroying most of them at the second attempt. This was followed by Italian air attacks on 7th Army troop concentrations. The VVKJ was unable to interdict the Axis air attacks because their fighters were based too far away. After having been grounded {{for most of the day}} by poor weather, in the afternoon, Yugoslav bombers flew missions against airfields and railway stations across the Reich frontier. By the close of 6 April, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant that nearly all the fighting was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava around Ptuj and Maribor, and a reinforced infantry regiment was approaching Dravograd from the west. German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services. LI Infantry Corps had occupied Gornja Radgona, Murska Sobota and Radenci, and had crossed the Drava near Sveti Duh. XLIX Mountain Corps captured <b>border</b> <b>crossings</b> on the approaches to Dravograd, but were held up by border troops in mountain passes located further west.|$|E

40|$|Immigration {{across the}} U. S. -Mexico border {{has been an}} issue since the Mexican-American War. While U. S. {{immigration}} policies have fluctuated over time to reflect the labor needs within the country, more recent policies have strengthened the <b>border</b> against <b>crossings.</b> This increased protection along the U. S. -Mexico border, particularly since the early 1990 s, has forced undocumented migrants to find less restricted, but more dangerous points of entry into the U. S., resulting in increased death rates for these immigrants. As the death toll climbs for undocumented border crossers (UBC), medical examiners??? offices face the task of improving identification methods necessary to repatriate them. A majority of these individuals are of Hispanic ancestry, indicating that they are from Mexico, Latin America, Central America, and South America. Until recently, forensic research was less expansive on Hispanic individuals in comparison to that for individuals of European and African American ancestry. As research increases on distinctive skeletal features of Hispanic populations, there remain some unexplored methods that could aid in identification, such as aspects of dental anthropology. This thesis explores the utility of two such dental anthropology methods, dental non-metric traits and the occlusal polygon, for UBC identification purposes. Adult dentition from six areas within the American Southwest and Mexico were scored and measured for these methods, respectively. These samples consist of known Southwest Hispanic and Mexican individuals from four locations and unknown UBC individuals from two locations. The results indicate that both the non-metric dental traits and the occlusal polygon show some differences between the Southwest Hispanic and Mexican samples. The dental non-metric traits, in particular, show promise {{for being able to}} classify UBC based on known samples. These results also demonstrate that Hispanic as a classificatory term does not account for the amount of variation observed among the groups in this study, and calls into question the validity of this term to describe populations from Mexico, Central America, and Latin America.

40|$|In {{her article}} 2 ̆ 2 Modern Migration in Two Arabic Novels 2 ̆ 2 Ikram Masmoudi proposes that twentieth-century Arab fiction {{is marked by}} {{the theme of the}} journey in literal and figurative ways. This motif {{features}} the theme of departure and arrival through characters <b>crossings</b> <b>borders</b> from East to West and from the periphery to the center (i. e., the metropolis) in order to acquire knowledge, understanding, and empowerment and {{to get a sense of}} Western modernity.

The Saint 2 ̆ 7 s Lamp by Yahya Haqqi and Season of Migration to the North by Tayeb Salih depict two different kinds of enigmatic arrivals. Their arrival is the opportunity to adjust and assess their positions and their cultural differences. Although the two arriving protagonists in these novels have different attitudes vis-à-vis the West and their local culture, the structure of arrival in both novels is not straightforward and immediate, but instead reflects a negotiation between two attitudes and a transition from an immediate, physical arrival to an inner, mental arrival. This leads to a new understanding of and an adjustment to a fuller sense of arrival...|$|R
40|$|In an era {{marked by}} multinationalism, globalization, transnationalism, and ethnopolitics, the {{conventional}} state border {{appears to be}} blurring at the edges, {{and in some instances}} extending beyond itself, This research seeks to test this proposition for a specific set of borders. ^ Historically, the Egyptian/Israeli border has been among the most rigid borders of the world. Often determined by a display-of-arms, the legally-determined border has shifted dozens of times. From the end of 1993 until early 1996, the existing border was permeated by ‘reciprocal-tourism’. The movement of people, across this particular ‘international borderland’, was symbolically as well as ideologically significant within this sociopolitical locus of world history. ^ This research examines specific “intergroup contact” (Amir 1969) between people from various ethnic groups; within the context of Egyptian tourists or travelers to Israel during this 1993 – 1996 period. The wider parameters of the study pertain to recent history (post- 1948 C. E. /Israeli independence), until the present. Situations and changes are addressed regarding the ‘crossing of borders’ between the contemporarily geopolitically defined countries of Israel and Egypt; including the Sinai (administered by Egypt), and areas currently known as Palestine, the West Bank, and Jerusalem (predominately East Jerusalem). ^ Using the peoples identified as tourists, this dissertation tests the proposition that: “international borderlands, at least as expressed by cross-border tourism policy and planning, represent an evolution of borders from formal boundaries to functional regions of ‘connectedness’ ” (Lewis in Richard 1993 : 602), in the specific case of the nations and inhabitants of contemporary Egypt and Israel. [Tourism broadly defined as traveling for recreation, business, mercantilism, and/or culture (e. g., religion or ideological importance), and, as the management of tourists and the promotion of touring. ] ^ This dissertation provides information essential to comprehending how identity is constructed—historically and culturally, within the context of <b>border</b> change, introductory <b>crossings,</b> reciprocity, and documented perceptions. Examining these constructions helps explain how cultural units (particularly state and church), establish social categories and mindsets, and how personal cultural perceptions produce identifiable depictions and presentations. ^ In this particular treatise, Egyptian constructions appear to embitter relations rather than promote the blurring of borders that might lead to regions of connectedness. ...|$|R
