5|$|The novel first follows Kallik {{who lives}} {{with her mother and}} brother. However, they are {{separated}} on ice when a group of killer whales attacks them and Kallik must survive by herself. On her own, Kallik decides to go to a gathering place for polar bears that her mom told her about. At the gathering, Kallik asks other polar bears if they have seen her brother, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has.</b> Alone, Kallik meets a female bear Nanuk who helps Kallik around the area. However, Nanuk is killed by a helicopter crash shipping her and Kallik back to the wild. Before she dies, Nanuk tells Kallik about a place where the ice never melts. Hearing this, Kallik sets off to this place.|$|E
25|$|In January 1993 an inquest jury {{returned}} a verdict that McElwaine had been unlawfully killed. The jury ruled {{the soldiers had}} opened fire without giving McElwaine a chance to surrender, {{and that he was}} actually shot dead five minutes after being wounded. The Director of Public Prosecutions requested a full report on the inquest from the RUC, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> been prosecuted for McElwaine's death.|$|E
25|$|In {{the initial}} questioning, {{it comes to}} light that the {{previous}} owner of the house, Sellon, {{was found dead in}} his shop, supposedly from a fall down the stairs, but it might have been more nefarious than that. There were suspicions of involvement in drugs and Sellon also left a note to the effect that he had come across something worth fourteen thousand pounds <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> yet found out what the item was.|$|E

60|$|Moreover, he {{said that}} the Walwyn {{property}} <b>had</b> been sequestered, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> yet purchased it, and he thought that for a fair sum, it might be redeemed for the family.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> {{heart for}} further gaiety, and, finding Lady Treherne already alarmed by Annon, {{they were forced}} to tell her all, and find their own bewilderment deepened by her {{unalterable}} belief in the evil omen.|$|R
25|$|The Bay Village Police and the FBI {{conducted}} an extensive investigation into her disappearance and murder. The case generated thousands of leads. Dozens of suspects {{were asked to}} take lie-detector tests, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> ever been charged with the crime. Law enforcement continues to pursue leads and monitor suspects to the present day. 20,000 interviews have taken place during the investigation. This was described {{to be the biggest}} search in Ohio since the disappearance of Beverly Potts.|$|E
25|$|The {{scenario}} that would place the first outbreak in central Asia {{agrees with the}} first reports of outbreaks in China in the early 1330s. The plague struck the Chinese province of Hubei in 1334. On {{the heels of the}} European epidemic, a more widespread disaster occurred in China during 1353–1354. Chinese accounts of this wave of the disease record a spread to eight distinct areas: Hubei, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, and Suiyuan, throughout the Mongol and Chinese empires. Historian William McNeill noted that voluminous Chinese records on disease and social disruption survive from this period, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> studied these sources in depth.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} dispute {{has been the}} Baghdad stone {{inscription}} in a Turkish script, which some interpret saying Baba Nanak Fakir was there in 1511-1512, other interpret it stating 1521-1522 (and that {{he lived in the}} Middle East for 11 years away from his family), while others particularly Western scholars stating that the stone inscription is from the 19th century and the stone is not a reliable evidence that Guru Nanak visited Baghdad in early 16th century. Further, beyond the stone, no evidence or mention of Guru Nanak's journey in the Middle East has been found in any other Middle Eastern textual or epigraphical records. Claims have been asserted of additional inscriptions, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> been able to locate and verify them. The Baghdad inscription remains the basis of writing by Indian scholars that Guru Nanak journeyed in the Middle East, with some claiming he visited Jerusalem, Mecca, Vatican, Azerbaijan and Sudan.|$|E
6000|$|For {{a moment}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> spoke; and then many spoke {{together}} {{to tell the}} same melancholy truth, {{that they had not}} yet got any Anhalt. [...] "Mr. Rushworth was to be Count Cassel, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> yet undertaken Anhalt." ...|$|R
6000|$|The cats all {{winked at}} her, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> any advice to offer, except Tobias, who {{walked to the}} shelf, and, looking up, uttered a deep, suggestive yowl, which said as plainly as words, [...] "Dinner first and {{discussion}} afterward." ...|$|R
500|$|... "We {{were the}} first ones to do {{downloadable}} content like that—some people had done similar things, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> really done additions where you add new stuff to your existing game." [...] There was no pressure from Microsoft to make the move.|$|R
500|$|During the 1995 season, one of {{his more}} {{important}} field goals for the Wolverines came in the 50 victory over Purdue. [...] However, when Northwestern beat Michigan at Michigan Stadium, 1913, for its first victory there since 1959, Hamilton missed a key 37-yard field goal. His 1995 total of 19field goals ranked second in Michigan history, behind only his own 1994 total. [...] Garrett Rivas tied that single-season total twice, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> unseated Hamilton from first and second place.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} story about Washington's {{childhood}} {{is that he}} chopped down his father's favorite cherry tree and admitted the deed when questioned: [...] "I can't tell a lie, Pa." [...] The anecdote was first reported by biographer Parson Weems, who interviewed people after Washington's death who knew him as a child over a half-century earlier. The Weems text was very widely reprinted throughout the 19th century, for example in McGuffey Readers. Adults wanted children to learn moral lessons from history, especially as taught by example from the lives of great national heroes like Washington. After 1890 historians insisted on scientific research methods to validate every statement, {{and there was no}} documentation for this anecdote apart from Weems' report that he learned it from one of the neighbors who knew the young Washington. Joseph Rodman claimed in 1904 that Weems plagiarized other Washington tales from published fiction set in England, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> found an alternative source for the cherry tree story.|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> seen Harry. In fact, this company, {{with the}} {{accumulated}} proceeds of a week's sumac gathering, {{had come from}} a portion of the county many miles from Crooked Creek, and of course, they could bring no news to Kate.|$|R
60|$|It {{was amazing}} {{to find that}} every <b>one</b> <b>had</b> been of exactly the same opinion for some time past, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> dared to suggest {{a course of action}} which implied a belief that Dan might be in {{imminent}} danger, if not worse.|$|R
5000|$|When Butler interviewed McAllister decades later, he remarked, [...] "The {{conclusion}} I came to {{was that}} nobody had asked them. New Criticism {{was about the}} scholars and the text; writers were {{cut out of the}} equation. Scholars would talk about symbolism in writing, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> asked the writers." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Big Gundown was {{endorsed}} by Morricone, who is quoted as saying: [...] "This is a record that has fresh, good and intelligent ideas. It is realization on a high level, a work done by a maestro with great science-fantasy and creativity... Many people have done versions of my pieces, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> done them like this".|$|E
2500|$|The Pastoral Concert {{is one of}} a {{small group}} of paintings, {{including}} the Virgin and Child with Saint Anthony and Saint Roch in the Prado, which are very close in style and, according to Charles Hope, have been [...] "more and more frequently given to Titian, not so much because of any very compelling resemblance to his undisputed early works—which would surely have been noted before—as because he seemed a less implausible candidate than Giorgione. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> been able to create a coherent sequence of Titian's early works that includes these ones, in a way that commands general support, and fits the known facts of his career. An alternative proposal is to assign the Pastoral Concert and the other pictures like it to a third artist, the very obscure Domenico Mancini..". While Crowe and Cavalcaselle considered the Concert from Palazzo Pitti as Giorgione's masterpiece but disattributed Louvre's Pastoral Concert, Lermolieff reinstated the Pastoral Concert and claimed instead that the Pitti Concert was by Titian.|$|E
2500|$|Furman was an {{exceptional}} openings specialist, and was respected as being of virtually world-class strength with the White pieces, {{with which he}} scored most of his wins over the top players, as the game selection shows. He was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "the world champion when playing White." [...] He could not score anywhere near as well as Black, and this held back his success. While best remembered today as Karpov's trainer, Furman also made many important contributions to the success of other top players, such as Bronstein, Botvinnik, Korchnoi, and Geller. He developed several significant improvements to opening theory. He favoured the closed openings (1.d4, 1.c4, 1.Nf3) as White, and in many of his wins over top-class rivals, his opponents were simply unable to generate counterplay, and were slowly strangled by Furman's precise, yet amorphous strategy. Karpov noted that a book on Furman's career and best games would be well received and valuable; <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> yet taken up this challenge.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century, {{reinforced}} concrete became an acceptable substitute in construction for all previous structural materials, such as stone, wood, and steel. People such as Monier had developed useful techniques for design and construction, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> created new forms that showed the full aesthetic nature of reinforced concrete.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> seen it {{and each}} was {{positive}} in his {{assurance that the}} sacrificial weapon had not been upon Tarzan's person when they captured him. The ape-man looked upon the menacing creatures which surrounded him and snarled his defiance. He looked upon La and smiled. In {{the face of death}} he was unafraid.|$|R

Honk's problem was with the business, not the players. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> any difficulty with anyone else in the band. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> the ego to stay with it when things weren't working."

50|$|Both ships {{replenished}} in Disko Bay {{and into}} August attempted {{to renew their}} search. But the ice was heavier than the previous year, and neither ships nor men could have lasted through another winter. Scurvy <b>had</b> struck, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> died.

6000|$|Now, when {{he heard}} this, King Krewl was much {{disturbed}} in mind, for he knew the Scarecrow spoke the truth. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> ever before come to Jinxland from the Land of Oz and the King {{did not intend to}} be put out of his throne if he could help it. Therefore he gave a harsh, wicked laugh of derision and said: ...|$|R
60|$|So all the princes and knights were bidden {{to present}} {{themselves}} before the King that night, {{so that he}} who had ridden so far up the glass hill might show the golden apple which the King's daughter <b>had</b> thrown down. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> anything to show. One knight presented himself after the other, and none could show the apple.|$|R
60|$|All {{attempts}} to kill {{this young man}} ought really to be given up now. The job has been tried {{over and over again}} by villains and bad people of all kinds, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> ever succeeded. There has been an amount of energy and ingenuity expended in seeking to lay up that one man which, properly utilized, might have finished off ten million ordinary mortals. It is sad to think of so much wasted effort.|$|E
60|$|This {{proposition}} {{was received}} {{with one of}} those wild shouts of approbation which indicate the orator has exactly hit his audience between wind and water. The fact is the public mind at this instant wanted to be led, and in Dandy Mick a leader appeared. A leader to be successful should embody in his system the necessities of his followers; express what every one feels, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> had the ability or the courage to pronounce.|$|E
60|$|Everybody {{has heard}} of the Little House in the Kensington Gardens, {{which is the only}} house in the whole world that the fairies have built for humans. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> really seen it, except just three or four, and they have not only seen it but slept in it, and unless you sleep in it you never see it. This is because it is not there when you lie down, but it is there when you wake up and step outside.|$|E
