40|$|The {{research}} is {{initiated by the}} findings that the coating variation of light weight coated LWC paper is in synchronization with a <b>backing</b> <b>roll</b> of a coating station. The frequency of the largest peak in the quality variation spectrum corresponds to the oval geometry of a <b>backing</b> <b>roll,</b> but no such a phenomenon has been measured in a roll shop. It was realized {{that the cause of}} the research problem could be the change in the geometry as a function of running speed. First, a theoretical study is carried out by building a single cross-section FE model of a <b>backing</b> <b>roll</b> using measured wall thickness data with systematic thickness variation. Only the main variation component is used. The analysis shows the wall thickness variation is a possible cause for a dynamic geometry change. For a more detailed study, a cylindrical FE model is created, and the measured wall thickness matrix is used to define the inner surface nodes. The analysis shows dynamic geometry change although the geometry is more complex due to fixed end plates. A device is developed to measure the dynamic geometry change. The device is calibrated using a multi-lobe disc as a reference standard. Using the principles of GUM (Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurements) it is shown that the expanded uncertainty U of the device is less than two micrometers in a typical measuring case. A full scale <b>backing</b> <b>roll</b> is used as a test roll in laboratory experiments. The measurements of the roll show similar behavior that was observed in the FE analyses. The magnitude of the change in simulation was about 20 % lower than in the measurements. It is concluded that enhancements in the FE model and the processing of the measuring data would lead to more consistent results. The significance of the phenomenon is studied using a quite large sample of <b>backing</b> <b>rolls</b> at paper mills in Finland and abroad. The measured rolls are classified according to different generations of manufacturing processes and materials used. The study showed that dynamic geometry change is a common phenomenon in industry. A correlation analysis between machine direction quality variations of LWC paper and the dynamic behavior of a <b>backing</b> <b>roll</b> shows a very strong correlation. In many cases, the dynamic geometry change is the most significant single component causing run-out, and thus the main single cause for the harmonic paper quality variation. During the research, some methods were used for maintenance purposes to improve the dynamic behavior of <b>backing</b> <b>rolls.</b> According to the measurements, the used maintenance methods proved to be useful...|$|R

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{movement}} {{and the desire to}} participate in sports activities are declining all over the world. The health situation of children and adolescents is worsening and consequently there are growing numbers of obese, overweight children. The main reason for this is a fast spreading sedentary lifestyle. To establish and maintain a healthy life it is important to partake in a sufficient amount of various physical activities. Nowadays, children and adolescents spend a considerable amount of time at school; additionally school subject Physical Education presents the only physical activity for many of them and hence it is of utmost importance that time for sports is spent in a quality way. Adolescents differ in their motor abilities and this is important to consider at Physical Education class. It is not correct to treat all children and adolescents in the same manner. Some specific adjustments are required. They are important not only for children with special needs – here we include physically impaired children, blind and partially sighted, deaf and hard-of-hearing, children with mental disabilities and also obese children and children with excess body weight. Their excess weight is definitely a factor that prevents them from moving. The theoretical part of my Master’s thesis presents the problems of obesity and excess weight in details; these are two omnipresent concepts in our society. We present the importance of exercising for health. We summarize the findings of previous studies, which dealt with the issue of fast-spreading trend in obesity worldwide as well as in Slovenia. We also made a summary of those studies that examined the motor abilities of obese, overweigh children. We listed the characteristics and types of differentiations as well as individualizations that can be carried out in school, especially at Physical Education class. Twenty-three primary school teachers from various primary schools in Ljubljana, all of who teach Physical Education, participated in the empirical part of the thesis. We were interested in three things: how often they modify the curriculum of Physical Education to adjust classes to obese, overweight children, what are the influences of those adjustments and what is their opinion on the manual Prilagoditve vsebin pri predmetu šport debelim in prekomernim učencem v prvem in drugem triletju. The results of the survey show that more than a half of all teachers often adjust the classes {{to meet the needs of}} pupils. Most often they adjust running, front roll, <b>back</b> <b>roll</b> and exercises that demand a large number of repetitions (for example: rope jumping, gymnastic exercises for strength). Running is modified by shortening the distance the pupils have to run. Time of active running is often shortened; running is combined with walking periods. Front and <b>back</b> <b>roll</b> are modified with the help of an incline, which makes it easier for pupils to make a flip; additionally pupils are asked to land on their knees. Exercises that demand a large number of repetition are modified by lessening the number of repetitions. The majority of teachers is of an opinion that those adjustments have a positive influence on obese, overweight children. They have highlighted that the adjustment enable pupils to be more successful, which has a direct positive influence on their self-esteem. In addition, goals are more achievable. Most teachers have a similar opinion on the usefulness of the manual. They emphasize that it is useful, understandable and detailed. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{predominant}} {{trend in}} paper machines is towards an increased running speed. At the same time, the paper produced {{must have a}} higher and more even quality. In printing papers the main end-use properties and quality components are runnability, printability, and print quality. These coexistent requirements create new demands for the behaviour of rolls under production conditions. High quality printing paper grades are coated. In blade coating {{the thickness of the}} coating film on the paper surface is found to be heavily dependent on the run-out of the <b>backing</b> <b>roll</b> which supports the paper web against the metering blade. The run-out tolerance of <b>backing</b> <b>rolls</b> at running speed has lately been 50  µm and should be substantially reduced in the future. The new tolerances can no longer be met by tightening the traditional roll manufacturing tolerances. A new predictive 3 D grinding method has been developed to improve roll behaviour in the paper production environment. It consists of a measuring system, which can verify the rotational and geometry errors of the roll at running speed, and a 3 D grinding system, which controls the grinding process according to the information gained by these measurements. In this study, the new method was applied to the <b>backing</b> <b>rolls</b> of a coating station. The experiments were carried out in a paper mill, on a medium-weight coated (MWC) paper production line. The paper was analysed before and after the predictive 3 D grinding. The predictive 3 D grinding reduced the machine direction (MD) ash variation caused by the <b>backing</b> <b>rolls</b> by an average of 76  %. Ash variation correlates well with coating variation. As a result of a more even coating film, MD gloss variation was reduced by 82  %. Reduced gloss variation improves the print quality of LWC paper. The variation in thickness caused by the <b>backing</b> <b>rolls</b> was reduced by 74  %. More even paper thickness reduces excitations and therefore improves runnability in calendering, winding, and printing. A new paradigm for roll grinding was set. The applications of the technology are not limited to high-speed paper machine rolls; the method can also be applied to different kinds of nips of rolls. The method can compensate for a systematic error causing nip force variation, such as uneven thermal expansion or the uneven flexural stiffness of a roll. The technology can be applied in different industries, such as the steel, plastics, or aluminium industries. With this method, it is also possible to use rolls in applications which have requirements too high to be met by traditional technology. reviewe...|$|R
