40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the use and impact of {{electronic}} resources on R & D institutions library <b>users</b> in <b>the</b> Mysore city, Karnataka. A questionnaire survey of research community from the three R&D institutions libraries at the Mysore city of Karnataka was conducted. In a total 180 questionnaires were distributed among <b>the</b> <b>users,</b> out of which 140 users were responded. It also assesses use of print vs. electronic resources, awareness about use of electronic resources, quantum of time spend to search required information, interfaces used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>users</b> to begin search process and importance given <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>users</b> to e-resources for their research work also discussed. Further, <b>the</b> preference given <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>users</b> to read retrieved information, the extent of satisfaction by using print and e-resources and <b>the</b> barriers faced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>users</b> while using e-resources are discussed. Finally, the suggestions were given for the improvement of use of e-resources and to overcome from <b>the</b> barriers faced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>users</b> while using e-resources also explained...|$|R

5|$|The {{decompression}} algorithms can {{be adjusted}} to compensate for altitude. This was first done by Bühlmann for deriving altitude corrected tables, and is now common on diving computers, where an altitude setting can be selected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>user.</b>|$|E

The battery is an 840mAh internal rechargeable, compared to 1000mAh for the DS Lite, and has an optimal lifespan of approximately 500 cycles; after this point, it may be replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>user.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prediction is a rate {{enhancement}} {{strategy in}} which the device attempts to predict the letter, word or phrase being written <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>user.</b> The user can then select the correct prediction without needing to write the full word. Word prediction software may determine the words predicted based on their frequency in language, association with other words, past choices of the user, or grammatical suitability.|$|E

5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>user.</b> Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E
5|$|The TRIM command {{also needs}} {{the support of}} the SSD. If the {{firmware}} in the SSD does not have support for the TRIM command, the LBAs received with the TRIM command will not be marked as invalid and the drive will continue to garbage collect the data assuming it is still valid. Only when the OS saves new data into those LBAs will the SSD know to mark the original LBA as invalid. SSD Manufacturers that did not originally build TRIM support into their drives can either offer a firmware upgrade to the user, or provide a separate utility that extracts the information on the invalid data from the OS and separately TRIMs the SSD. The benefit would be realized only after each run of that utility <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>user.</b> The user could set up that utility to run periodically in the background as an automatically scheduled task.|$|E
5000|$|Like poker sites, many skillgame sites take a rake from {{head-to-head}} and tournament games; however, this oft-ignored {{practice is}} de facto illegal in the U.S. Unlike casino games or games of chance, {{the outcome of}} a skill game is predominantly determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>user's</b> skill level. In many U.S. states, the outcome must be determined entirely <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>user's</b> skill level.|$|R

5|$|Users {{must have}} either found {{decryption}} keys themselves or obtained them elsewhere for most versions of BackupHDDVD to work. The utility reads a text file containing volume or title keys {{and attempts to}} find a set of corresponding keys for the inserted disc. Through a standard AES library, it then decrypts each video file on the disc using the appropriate keys and writes the results to a location specified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>user.</b> Direct file decryption allows the utility's functionality to remain unaffected by device key revocation and its performance unencumbered with AACS overhead.|$|E
5|$|Valve added Steam Guard {{functionality}} to the Steam {{client in}} March 2011 {{to protect against}} the hijacking of accounts via phishing schemes, one of the largest support issues Valve had at the time. Steam Guard was advertised {{to take advantage of the}} identity protection provided by Intel's second-generation Core processors and compatible motherboard hardware, which allows users to lock their account to a specific computer. Once locked, activity by that account on other computers must first be approved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> on the locked computer. Support APIs for Steam Guard are available to third-party developers through Steamworks. Steam Guard also offers two-factor, risk-based authentication that uses a one-time verification code sent to a verified email address associated with the Steam account; this was later expanded to include two-factor authentication through the Steam mobile application, known as Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator. If Steam Guard is enabled, the verification code is sent each time the account is used from an unknown machine.|$|E
5|$|A Standard Ticket {{contactless}} {{smart card}} for single or return journeys {{may also be purchased}} at the GTM for the payment of MRT and/or LRT fares. A S$0.10 deposit will be levied on top of the fare to be paid. The deposit will be automatically refunded through an offset of the fare to be paid for the third journey on the same ticket while an additional discount of S$0.10 will be given for the sixth journey on the same ticket. No refund of the deposit is provided if the card is used for fewer than 3 journeys. The ticket can be used for the purchase of single or return journeys to and from pre-selected stations up to a maximum of six journeys over 30 days. Fares for the Standard Ticket are always higher than those charged for the stored-valued CEPAS (EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay) cards for the same distance traveled. The ticket is retained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> after each journey and {{does not need to be}} returned to any GTM or Passenger Service Centre. Identical to the usage of CEPAS cards, the ticket is tapped onto the faregate reader upon entry and exit.|$|E
