5|$|Khalid {{detached}} one regiment under Dharar ibn al-Azwar {{and ordered}} him to attack {{the front of the}} army of Dairjan (left center) {{in order to create a}} diversion and threaten the withdrawal of the Byzantine right wing from its advanced position. With the rest of the cavalry reserve he attacked Gregory's flank. Here again, under simultaneous attacks from the front and flanks, the Byzantines fell <b>back,</b> <b>but</b> more slowly because they had to maintain their formation.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the year, Grabner {{failed to}} score at his {{previous}} pace {{as with the}} Islanders, but was a decent addition on the penalty kill and had some hot streaks. Despite the decrease in production, the Maple Leafs had interest in bringing Grabner <b>back,</b> <b>but</b> a plethora of young players expected to make the roster the following season prevented the team from signing him.|$|E

5|$|When {{they reach}} the {{coordinates}} shown on the parchments, there is no island in sight. Frustrated, Haddock ponders turning <b>back,</b> <b>but</b> Tintin soon realizes the problem: If Sir Francis had used a French chart instead of an English chart to calculate the position, the coordinates would have been measured on the Paris Meridian rather than the Greenwich Meridian. As they have been using the Greenwich Meridian, they realise that they are too far west.|$|E
5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} patrol from the 13th Parachute Battalion reported a large gathering of Germans in Bréville and suspected an attack was imminent. At 08:00 a massive artillery and mortar bombardment fell along the 1st Special Service Brigade lines, while the 857th Grenadier Regiment, which had {{gathered in the}} village, attacked No. 6 Commando. By 10:30, the attack on No. 6 Commando had been driven <b>back,</b> <b>but</b> to their left at Hauger No.4 Commandos had to win a hand-to-hand fight before the Germans withdrew. Twice more during the day the commandos were attacked unsuccessfully, from Sallenelles {{in the north and}} again from Bréville.|$|E
5|$|After Oxbow's maiden win, he {{was flown}} to Hollywood Park in California {{to run in}} the Grade I CashCall Futurity at a mile and one-sixteenth (1,700m) on a {{synthetic}} surface. He was the longest shot in the field at 61–1, and drew the far outside post at number eleven. Ridden by Corey Nakatani, his fifth jockey in five races, Oxbow broke well coming out the gate. He ran close to the front throughout the race, despite losing ground by being four horses wide around the first turn and three wide around the final turn. Oxbow finished fourth, nine lengths <b>back,</b> <b>but</b> earned his first Road to the Kentucky Derby point, and a speed figure of 87.|$|E

5|$|After an {{incomplete}} pass from quarterback Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies {{got their first}} big offensive break {{of the second half}}. On a designed play, Taylor scrambled for 31yards, the largest play in the game for the Hokies. Two successful runs by running back Branden Ore followed, earning the Hokies 23more yards and pushing the offense deep into Boston College territory. A false-start penalty set the Hokie offense <b>back,</b> <b>but</b> on the next play, quarterback Sean Glennon connected with wide receiver Eddie Royal on a 24-yard strike for a touchdown. The touchdown and extra point were the first points of the second half and gave Virginia Tech a 2316 lead with 6:30 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|After high school, Southern Mississippi offered Favre a {{football}} scholarship, {{which was the}} only one he received. Southern Miss wanted him to play defensive <b>back,</b> <b>but</b> Favre wanted to play quarterback instead. Favre began his freshman year as the seventh-string quarterback and took over the starting position {{in the second half of}} the third game of the year against Tulane on September 19, 1987. Favre, despite suffering a hangover from the night before and vomiting during warm-ups, led the Golden Eagles to a come-from-behind victory with two touchdown passes. Favre started ten games during his freshman year and won six of them.|$|E
5|$|As {{time goes}} by, Rumpelstiltskin and Belle develop a strong bond with each other. After {{a few months}} of living with him, Belle asks the dark one why she found children's {{clothing}} upstairs. Rumpelstiltskin tells her it belonged to his son whom he unfortunately lost along with his wife. Gaston arrives to take Belle <b>back</b> <b>but</b> Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it to her as a gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She left him because she wanted to be heroic and there are not many chances for women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more straw, and she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he does not expect to see her again.|$|E

He worked in the mines {{for a short time}} but handed in his notice after finding out just how {{difficult}} and unpleasant it was to work deep underground. He applied to join the police and reconsidered the offer from Leeds United. His trial game for Leeds clashed with his police interview, and Charlton chose to play in the game; the trial was a success and he joined the ground staff at Elland Road.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is of {{the mind}} that they're square; they've got {{everything}} out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend <b>back,</b> <b>but</b> he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E
5|$|Augustine was {{the prior}} of a monastery in Rome when Pope Gregory the Great chose him in 595 {{to lead a}} mission, usually known as the Gregorian mission, to Britain to Christianize King Æthelberht and his Kingdom of Kent from Anglo-Saxon paganism. Kent was {{probably}} chosen because Æthelberht had married a Christian princess, Bertha, daughter of Charibert I the King of Paris, who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. Before reaching Kent, the missionaries had considered turning <b>back,</b> <b>but</b> Gregory urged them on, and in 597, Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet and proceeded to Æthelberht's main town of Canterbury.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day there was still no signs of the {{expected}} German ground attack. That night was also uneventful but just after stand to on 8 June, German infantry were observed advancing through the woods to their front. Holding fire until the last minute, the Germans were beaten <b>back</b> <b>but</b> ATroop found themselves surrounded on three sides and forced to withdraw. That night the Germans attacked again, this time targeting CTroop, but were again driven back. Shortly thereafter a group from No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando arrived and reported that the Germans had broken through and were on the road behind No. 4 Commando. Captain Porteous and DTroop moved down the road to deal with them. Outnumbered two to one DTroop charged, killing some and forcing the rest to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{suffering}} a significant setback at the outset, when {{part of their}} small invasion force had its landing craft destroyed by Allied aircraft as they attempted {{to land on the}} coast behind the Australian defenders, the Japanese quickly pushed inland and began their advance towards the airfields. Heavy fighting followed as they encountered the Australian Militia troops that formed the first line of defence. These troops were steadily pushed <b>back,</b> <b>but</b> the Australians brought forward veteran Second Australian Imperial Force units that the Japanese had not expected. Allied air superiority helped tip the balance, providing close support to troops in combat and targeting Japanese logistics. Finding themselves heavily outnumbered, lacking supplies and suffering heavy casualties, the Japanese withdrew their forces, with fighting coming to an end on 7 September 1942.|$|E

However, Gaston stabs the Beast, but he loses his footing and falls to his death. The Beast dies before the last petal falls.

The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.|$|E

5|$|He {{joined his}} {{hometown}} football club, AIK Bačka Topola, as a youngster, and graduated {{to the senior}} side in 1998–99. He began as a centre <b>back,</b> <b>but</b> soon realised he preferred scoring goals to defending.

When military service took him to Bar, he was able to play for the local club, Mornar, for whom he scored 15 goals from 23 appearances in the 2001–02 Second League of FR Yugoslavia.
