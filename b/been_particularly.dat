5|$|Ignacio Asteazunzarra (Beltza) {{had been}} arrested in 1973 in Loyola, but had been freed by other ETA militants at gunpoint. He was {{believed}} to have been part of a cell which had <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> active in 1979 in attacks in the province of Álava.|$|E
5|$|It was {{designed}} by William Edward Willink and Philip Coldwell Thicknesse and was constructed between 1914 and 1917. The building's style {{is a mix of}} Italian Renaissance and Greek Revival, and its development has <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> influenced by Italian palace design. The building is noted for the ornate sculptures that adorn its sides.|$|E

50|$|Stalking is a {{controversial}} crime because a conviction {{does not require}} any physical harm. The anti-stalking statute of Illinois <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> controversial. It <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> restrictive, {{by the standards of}} this type of legislation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{some parts of}} voting theory are {{inherently}} untestable. Theories which predict that an outcome of voting will be one that has a certain relation to individual preferences <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> difficult to test because an empirical test requires information on those individual preferences, and such information is not available. This problem <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> difficult in voting theory because the holism of the mental <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> severe in this context. ...|$|R
5|$|Principles of {{attachment}} theory {{have been used}} to explain adult social behaviours, including mating, social dominance and hierarchical power structures, in-group identification, group coalitions, and negotiation of reciprocity and justice. Those explanations {{have been used to}} design parental care training, and have <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> successful in the design of child abuse prevention programmes.|$|E
5|$|The human {{innovation}} {{of cooking}} may have <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> helpful in overcoming {{many of the}} defensive chemicals of plants. Many enzyme inhibitors in cereal grains and pulses, such as trypsin inhibitors prevalent in pulse crops, are denatured by cooking, making them digestible.|$|E
5|$|Various {{groups have}} {{expressed}} reservations about, and criticisms of, {{parts of the}} New England Quarter development or the scheme as a whole. Two aspects have <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> controversial: the planning application for a 42-storey tower on the Block J site, which was refused but has been appealed against; and the Sainsbury's supermarket.|$|E

5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} gulls were seen briefly {{on the shores}} of the new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have had much more of an impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found the first evidence of nesting Atlantic puffins, which are extremely common {{in the rest of the}} archipelago.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, and just {{opposite}} his own tomb, Ramesses enlarged the earlier small tomb {{of an unknown}} Eighteenth Dynasty noble (KV5) for his numerous sons. With 120 known rooms, and excavation work still underway, it is probably the largest tomb in the valley. Originally opened (and robbed) in antiquity, it is a low-lying structure that has <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> prone to the flash floods that sometimes hit the area. Tonnes of debris and material has washed in over the centuries, ultimately concealing its vast size. It is not currently open to the public.|$|E
5|$|By June, {{the mayor}} was looking for {{political}} support to avert a full public inquiry. The National Party, whose members were dominant on the Council, and MLC Melinda Pavey had <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> critical {{of the actions of}} the Department of Local Government in the General Purpose Standing Committee. Local independent MP, Rob Oakeshott said, however, that the Council should instead address the findings of the report, and stop arguing about the facts or using emotional arguments in support of it. He also cautioned against getting politicians involved, stressing that this was a formal legal process.|$|E

The seaside town of Ayvalık and numerous towns in the provinces of Balıkesir, İzmir and Aydın <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> famous for their olive oil and related products; such as soap and cosmetics.|$|R
5|$|Ethology is {{the study}} of animal {{behavior}} (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E
5|$|First, Second and Third Creeks have <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> heavily modified. Some {{sections}} {{have been}} converted to concrete channels; others run through landscaped private gardens and some run in underground pipes. Much of the original vegetation has disappeared from the creeks, particularly those closest to the city. Introduced species including Olives, bamboo, boxthorn, watsonia and blackberries have displaced native flora.|$|E
5|$|German {{philosophy}} is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; {{the establishment of}} classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy; {{the development of the}} Frankfurt School by Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse and Jürgen Habermas have <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> influential.|$|E
50|$|The {{town has}} a {{voluntary}} rural fire brigade staffed by locals. The brigade uses a Bedford tanker and International fire appliance. The fire brigade <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> useful since {{the climate and}} local farms <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> prone to drought and grass fires during the summer season.|$|R

5|$|In August 1923 Moriarty died, and Fortune—who {{had never}} <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> popular among his followers—tried to {{convince}} them that she should be their new leader. A few accepted her offer, but many others instead accepted the leadership of Stafford-Allen. Meanwhile, Fortune's parents relocated to the garden city of Letchworth, Hertfordshire in 1922, and it was here that Fortune carried out what she deemed to be additional communications with the Masters through trance mediumship between 1923 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|In August 1932 {{there was}} an {{unsuccessful}} uprising by General José Sanjurjo, who had <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> appalled by events in Castilblanco. The aims of the insurrection were vague, and it quickly turned into a fiasco. Among the generals tried and sent to Spanish colonies were four men who {{would go on to}} distinguish themselves fighting against the Republic in the civil war: the Duke of Seville, Martin Alonso, Ricardo Serrador Santés, and Heli Rolando de Tella y Cantos.|$|E
5|$|In May, Quisling was {{shattered}} {{by the death of}} his mother Anna, as the two had <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> close. At the same time, the political crisis over Norwegian independence deepened, with Quisling threatening Terboven with his resignation over the issue of finance. In the end, the Reichskommissar agreed to compromise on the issue, but Quisling had to concede on the SS issue: A brigade was formed, but as a branch of the Nasjonal Samling.|$|E

5|$|It {{appears that}} {{predation}} by invasive mammalian species including ship rats, cats, and mustelids was an additional {{factor in the}} decline in huia numbers – introduction of these animals by New Zealand acclimatisation societies peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in huia populations. Because it {{spent a lot of}} time on the ground, the huia would have <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> vulnerable to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna.|$|E
5|$|Konnan {{is known}} to be outspoken, and in the last decade, he has been openly {{critical}} of promotions that he feels have mistreated either himself personally or the talent in general. He has <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> outspoken against what he sees as racism against Latino wrestlers in United States promotions – he butted heads with TNA over treatment of himself and Ron Killings, and WWE over issues regarding Latino wrestlers Alberto Del Rio and Rey Mysterio, but he has also come into conflict with AAA over what he alleged was non-payment of talent.|$|E
5|$|Several {{invertebrate}} {{systems are}} considered acceptable alternatives to vertebrates in early-stage discovery screens. Because of {{similarities between the}} innate immune system of insects and mammals, insects can replace mammals in some types of studies. Drosophila melanogaster and the Galleria mellonella waxworm have <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> important for analysis of virulence traits of mammalian pathogens. Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability. The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for significant gains in experimental throughput.|$|E
