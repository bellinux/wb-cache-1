5|$|Coexist {{features}} a minimalist musical style with spatial arrangements, loose song structure, little dynamism, and experimentation with tension. Its songs are characterised by sparse {{elements such as}} simple chord progression, keyboard ostinatos, and fading motifs, while Smith's production incorporates both programmed <b>beats</b> <b>and</b> live percussion instruments. Coexist touches on themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and intimacy. The lyrics, written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim, address a failing relationship and changes in a romance with inner monologues and simple metaphors.|$|E

The band's musical direction was mainly determined by Townsend, whose battle with bipolar disorder and dark sense of humour were major influences on his songwriting. Townsend was also noted for his eccentric appearance and on-stage behaviour, which greatly contributed to the band's intense live performances.|$|E

5|$|Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) is {{the debut}} studio album by the American hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, {{released}} November 9, 1993, on Loud Records and distributed through RCA Records. Recording sessions for the album {{took place during}} 1992 to 1993 at Firehouse Studio in New York City, and it was mastered at The Hit Factory. The album's title originates from the martial arts film The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978). The group's de facto leader RZA produced the album entirely, utilizing gritty, eerie <b>beats</b> <b>and</b> a sound largely based on martial-arts movie clips and soul music samples.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a {{genre of}} rock music that {{developed}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic <b>beats,</b> <b>and</b> overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level has been added in World Tour. This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with bass drum <b>beats,</b> <b>and</b> allowing any or no fret button to be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be hit (for drums), or any sound to be made (for vocals).|$|E

40|$|Punishments {{had five}} {{levels in the}} Tang Code. They were, {{beginning}} with the most severe, capital punishment, banishment, compulsory labor, <b>beating,</b> <b>and</b> whipping. <b>Beating</b> <b>and</b> whipping were applied to misdemeanors in general. But in the Han period, they were not formal punishments prescribed in the Han Code, but were used as sanction or admonition. That is to say, they didn’t belong to the category of punishments, which {{were based on the}} principle of mutilation. Although they were applied as an admonition in the case of additional penalties, <b>beating</b> <b>and</b> whipping did not have their own positions as light punishments. And the reason why {{there was no difference in}} carrying out <b>beating</b> <b>and</b> whipping was that they were not in the category of punishments in the Han dynasty. From when did <b>beating</b> <b>and</b> whipping gain formal position as punishments below the death penalty, banishment and compulsory labor? Why could they change the character of a sanction as admonition to the formal punishments as the five kinds of punishments in the code? This is the main theme of this article. The establishment of the punishments of <b>beating</b> <b>and</b> whipping originated in the Wei (北魏) Statutes of 481 AD. It was a departure from the system of punishment under the Han, and the start of establishing a syncretic system of punishment based on Chinese and nomadic systems...|$|R

5|$|In late 1984 Chrisye {{approached}} {{another young}} composer, Adjie Soetama, {{to help him}} prepare his next album. Light <b>beats</b> <b>and</b> cheerful melodies were in vogue at the time; therefore the two used a lighter style. Recording for the new album, titled Aku Cinta Dia (I Love Her), began in 1985, with additional songs from Guruh and Dadang S. Manaf. The titular song was chosen after Aciu heard a jam session led by Adjie and immediately decided {{that it would be}} the lead single. The album called for more emoting, which Chrisye– known as having a stiff stage persona– struggled to deliver, though Yanti prepared colourful costumes and Alex Hasyim trained him in choreography. Upon its release, Aku Cinta Dia sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the first week and was eventually certified gold. That same year, Chrisye and Adji Soetama released Hip Hip Hura (Hip Hip Hurray!), and another collaboration, Nona Lisa (Miss Lisa), was released in 1986; the later two albums had similar <b>beats</b> <b>and</b> rhythms and sold well, although not as well as Aku Cinta Dia. On 2 March 1986 Chrisye and Yanti had their second daughter, Risty Nurraisa.|$|E

5|$|When {{deciding}} on Charlotte staff, Toba {{thought it would}} be better not to have exactly the same team that produced Angel Beats!. Having already decided to stick with Maeda, Na-Ga and P.A.Works, Toba aimed to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process, and in doing so would prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!. With that in mind, Toba wanted a director who had a good understanding of Angel <b>Beats!</b> <b>and</b> who would also be suitable as Charlotte director, leading him to seek out Yoshiyuki Asai. Toba took into consideration the storyboarding Asai had done for two episodes of Angel <b>Beats!,</b> <b>and</b> he thought that Charlotte would be a good opportunity to have a first-time series director. Asai was also chosen as someone who could handle both comedic and serious moments. When Horikawa first looked at Charlotte incomplete script, he told Maeda that it did not feel like it had the same kind of zeal that Angel Beats! had. However, once he saw the whole script, his concerns with it were dispelled, much to Maeda's relief.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, {{at least in part}} because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering in the air with rapid wing <b>beats</b> <b>and</b> scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E

Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing <b>beats,</b> <b>and</b> often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E
5|$|Grindcore is {{an extreme}} genre of music that {{originated}} {{in the early to}} mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast <b>beats,</b> <b>and</b> vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.|$|E

The album peaked at number twenty-eight on the Billboard 200, and at number four on the UK Albums Chart.|$|E
