5000|$|<b>Budipine</b> (brand name Parkinsan) is an antiparkinson agent marketed for the {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease.http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800003459 ...|$|E
50|$|His {{research}} interests include the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease, the early {{diagnosis and treatment of}} dementia syndromes, the pathophysiology of alcohol addiction and the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder. He has authored or co-authored more than 400 Journal articles. Kornhuber described novel molecular mechanisms of approved psychotropic drugs, namely that memantine, amantadine, <b>budipine</b> and orphenadrine act as low-affinity NMDA-receptor antagonists. The data obtained with memantine formed an important basis for its worldwide approval as an antidementive drug. Kornhuber developed the pharmacokinetic hypothesis explaining the delayed therapeutic effects of antidepressant drugs. Furthermore, he found that antidepressant drugs like amitriptyline and fluoxetine mediate their effects on neurogenesis and behavior by lowering ceramide abundance in the brain. Among his coauthors has been Peter Riederer.|$|E
40|$|Apoptosis is one {{essential}} {{step for}} neuronal {{death in the}} nigrostriatal region in patients with Parkinson's disease. Cytotoxic tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin- 6 (Il- 6) provide a proapoptotic environment. We investigated {{the influence of the}} antiparkinsonian compound <b>budipine</b> on the release of TNF-alpha and Il- 6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and on the degree of cisplatin induced apoptotic cell death in SH-SY 5 Y human neuroblastoma cells. 10 (- 7), 10 (- 8), 10 (- 9) mol/l of <b>budipine</b> significantly reduced release of TNF-alpha and Il- 6 in PBMC and decreased apoptotic cell death after 50 hours and 74 hours in the SH-SY 5 Y cells. Our results suggest, that <b>budipine</b> administration provides an antiapoptotic environment and slows neuronal apoptotic and inflammatory mediated loss of neurons...|$|E
40|$|Evidence has {{recently}} suggested that NMDA receptors {{may play a}} role in the aetiology and possible treatment of depression and that weak noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists such as amantadine can synergize with conventional antidepressants in a model of the illness. To try to obtain a neurochemical rationale for these findings, we have studied the effects of acute and chronic administration of amantadine or the related drug <b>budipine</b> on cortical release of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) following the antidepressants reboxitine (REB), paroxetine (PAROX) and clomipramine (CLOM) in freely moving rats by using microdialysis. Acute administration of amantadine (40 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), <b>budipine</b> (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), REB (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), PAROX (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) or CLOM (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) all failed to significantly alter extracellular 5 -HT in the cortex. However, when either amantadine or <b>budipine</b> was administered 30 [*]min prior to any of the three antidepressants, a significant rise in 5 -HT was observed. For chronic studies, the effects of the drugs were studied at 4, 7, 14 and 21 days. Amantadine and <b>budipine</b> did not significantly alter extracellular 5 -HT at any time point. The three antidepressant drugs all elicited a gradual increase in 5 -HT, which became significant after 14 days and tended to plateau thereafter. When either amantadine (20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) or <b>budipine</b> (5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) was coadministered with any of the three antidepressants, two differences were seen compared with the effects of the antidepressants alone. Firstly, the time required for significant increases in cortical 5 -HT was reduced with elevated levels now being observed by 7 days. Secondly, the absolute magnitude of the increase in extracellular 5 -HT was markedly greater in these rats from day 7 until the end of the experiment. If, as is widely considered, an increase in extracellular 5 -HT represents a critical step in the mechanism of action of antidepressants, these data suggest that combined treatment with clinically tolerated NMDA antagonists such as amantadine could reduce the delay in therapeutic onset of antidepressants as well as possibly enhance their efficacy...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{that lack}} {{cytochrome}} P 450 2 D 6 (CYP 2 D 6) activity {{may have an}} altered risk of drug dependence or abuse because this enzyme {{is important in the}} metabolism of some drugs of abuse, including hydrocodone. In rats, hydrocodone conversion to hydromorphone is catalyzed by CYP 2 D 1, the rat homolog of the human CYP 2 D 6. To determine the impact of impaired hy-dromorphone formation on the behavioral effects of the parent compound, hydrocodone-induced analgesia and hyperactivity, hydrocodone discrimination and self-administration were ex-amined in male Wistar rats, with or without pretreatment with CYP 2 D 1 inhibitors (quinine and <b>budipine).</b> In vivo, quinine (20 mg/kg) and <b>budipine</b> (10 mg/kg) produced a marked suppres-sion in brain and plasma hydromorphone levels detected after the peripheral administration of hydrocodone, thus confirmin...|$|E
30|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease, {{which is}} caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra. This decrease in dopamine is correlated with the motor impairment and eventually leads to tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity [163]. Patients are generally treated with dopamine agonist drugs such as amantadine, <b>budipine,</b> levodopa but these drugs do have unfavorable benefit/side effect profile ratio as well. Levodopa remains as the gold standard of treatment. The efficacy of these drugs fades away after some years as the side effect restricts its long-term use. Moreover, the bioavailability of orally administered drugs depends on several factors when it reaches the dopamine receptor such as gastric pH and dietary protein. Another administration routes such as intranasal, rectal, sublingual or pulmonary did not show any satisfactory result because none could maintain a continuous stimulation of dompaminergic drug. Miniaturization of a device to nanoscale and incorporation of drug for its continuous release have become major challenges. Researchers are carrying out several approaches with dopamine infused in liposome and are testing its efficacy on rat model of PD. Dopamine conjugated on the surface of chitosan nanoparticle administered in rat model has resulted in less cytotoxic long-term release than dopamine alone. Other than that polyethylene imine-grafted chitosan nanocarriers for gene delivery approach have also been studied [166, 167]. Recently theranostic device such as l-DOPA coated with manganese oxide which can act as a dual MRI contrast agent as well as drug delivery agent is a promising area of interest for PD treatment [168]. Polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone-poly (acrylic acid) (PVP/PAA) and PLGA have been used for the synthesis of NP and investigation carried out on animal model has shown better results in comparison to free dopamine alone. Administration of biodegradable nanodrug to the targeting molecules of PD which include neurotrophic factors such as GDNF-MPs in rat model and monkey model has shown better structural and functional recovery of Parkinsonian monkey.|$|E
