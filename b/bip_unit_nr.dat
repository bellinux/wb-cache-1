40|$|Nature of {{the issue}} • Reactive {{nitrogen}} (N r) has well-documented positive eff ects in agricultural and industrial production systems, human nutrition and food security. Limited N r supply was a key constraint to European food and industrial production, which has been overcome by Nr from the Haber–Bosch process. • Given the huge diversity in N r uses, it becomes a major challenge to summarize an overall inventory of Nr benefits. This full list of benefits needs to be quantified if society is to develop sound approaches to optimize Nr management, balancing the benefits against the environmental threats. Approaches • When reviewing trends in European N r production rates, including those from chemical and biological fixation processes, and the consumption of this Nr in human activities, agriculture {{is by far the}} largest sector driving Nr creation. • Particular attention has been given to relationships between N application rates, productivity and quality of products from major crops and livestock types, including consideration of the mechanisms underlying variations in N response/outputs and the derived impacts on land use and land requirements. Key findings/state of knowledge • The economic value of N benefits to the European economy is very substantial. Almost half of the global food can be produced because of Nr from the Haber–Bosch, and cereal yields in Europe without fertilizer would only amount to half to two-thirds of those with fertilizer application at economically optimal rates. • There is a wide variety in N responses at field level. For cereals, nitrogen productivity, also termed the agronomic efficiency, averages 41 kg grain per kg applied fertilizer N across the EU countries, with significant variation between the member states. Variation reflects differences in crop type, farm type, cropping practices, area, region, soil fertility and climate. • Farmers have an economic incentive to apply only the economically optimal rate of fertilizer N, but there is no strong incentive to increase N use efficiency as the economic return on using fertilizer N is very robust, especially in high value crops. However, recent initiatives to reduce environmental impacts of Nr losses have led to an increase of N use efficiency in both crop and livestock production. • Increasing fertilizer prices and climate change will create new incentives to increase N use effi ciency. Th ere are ample options to achieve this via N-conserving field practices such as catch crops, reduced soil tillage, better estimation of crop N requirements and improved timing and placement of N inputs. Also modifications to livestock diets, enhanced recycling of livestock wastes, prevention of ammonia loss from animal housing and fi eld manure application can enhance benefits per <b>unit</b> applied <b>Nr.</b> Plant materials with improved composition of major storage compounds and novel feed additives, e. g. proteins from bio-fuel production, can also improve feed N responses per <b>unit</b> mass <b>Nr</b> used. Recommendations • Legislative drivers to reduce Nr use, including mineral fertilizer, must take account of the nitrogen benefits in agricultural production needed to maintain food and energy security, given the limited options to increase arable land area. • New technological tools should be implemented to improve nitrogen-effi ciency and the overall benefits of Nr use...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{indicator}} measuring one {{dimension of the}} sustainability of an entity in modern societies: Nitrogen-neutrality. N-neutrality strives to offset Nr releases an entity exerts on the environment from the release of reactive nitrogen (Nr) to the environment by reducing and offsetting the Nr releases elsewhere. N-neutrality also aims to increase awareness {{about the consequences of}} unintentional releases of nitrogen to the environment. N-neutrality is composed of two quantified elements: Nr released by an entity (e. g. {{on the basis of the}} N footprint) and Nr reduction from management and offset projects (N offset). It includes management strategies to reduce nitrogen losses before they occur (e. g., through energy conservation). Each of those elements faces specific challenges with regard to data availability and conceptual development. Impacts ofNr releases to the environment are manifold, and the impact profile ofone <b>unit</b> of <b>Nr</b> release depends strongly on the compound released and the local susceptibility to Nr. As such, N-neutrality is more difficult to conceptualize and calculate than C-neutrality. We developed a workable conceptual framework for N-neutrality which was adapted for the 6 th International Nitrogen Conference (N 2013, Kampala, November 2013). Total N footprint of the surveyed meals at N 2013 was 66 kg N. A total of US$ 3, 050 was collected from the participants and used to offset the conference’s N footprint by supporting the UN Millennium Village cluster Ruhiira South-Western Uganda. The concept needs further development in particular to better incorporate the spatio-temporal variability of impacts and to standardize the methods to quantify the required N offset to neutralise the Nrreleases impact. Criteria for compensation projects need to be sharply defined to allow the development of a market for N offset certificates. JRC. H. 4 -Monitoring Agricultural Resource...|$|R

Using {{geographic information system}} (GIS), we identified the irreplaceable values (IR) of 1, 434 units of the terrestrial ecological function areas. Based on the IR values of the units, we divided the units into three classes with decreasing priorities, including the mandatory reserve (MR) units (20), the negotiable reserve (<b>NR)</b> <b>units</b> (29), and the partially reserved (PR) units (40). The MR, NR, and PRunits covered 2. 2 %, 6. 0 %, and 11. 8 % of the ecological function areas of the whole country, respectively.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) (Coursework) [...] University of Melbourne, 2005 This {{research}} evolved out of {{the need}} to design and validate an instrument for the assessment of competencies within the specialised area of the Operating Suite. The study represents an attempt to develop an instrument underpinning the <b>unit</b> of competency <b>NR</b> 4 - The Instrument Nurse from the Australian College of Operating Room Nurses standards (2004). Both holistic and analytical rubrics were developed that were aligned to the ACORN Standard and underpinned by the Dreyfus (1981) model in accordance with the rules established by Griffin and colleagues (2001). Three video clips that captured the varying performances of instrument nurses in the operating suite were recorded and used as prompts for rating. Forty raters were required to judge the performance of the candidates in each video clip using an Analytical Observation Form, Holistic Performance Level Rubrics and Holistic Competence Rubrics. The study found that the holistic rubrics led to more consistent judgements than the analytical rubrics, yet the latter provided more diagnostic information for intervention purposes. Despite less consistency, the results revealed that the Analytical Observation Form had sufficient construct validity as determined by the Item Separation Index (Rasch, 1960). The study also revealed that the Analytical Observation Form had high internal consistency and greater inter-rater reliability when average ratings were used. The findings had direct implications for theory, practice and future research. Restricted Access: Staff and Students of the University Onl...|$|R

40|$|This article aims {{toward a}} full {{description}} of the wetting conversion from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity under illumination with UV light of high-density ZnO nanorods surfaces by (i) following {{the evolution of the}} clusters and superstructures formed by the nanocarpet effect {{as a function of the}} water contact angle (WCA); (ii) characterization of the superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic states with an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM); and (iii) using the nanocarpet effect as a footprint of both local and apparent water contact angles. Thus, the main objective of the article is to provide a general vision of the wettability of 1 D photoactive surfaces. In parallel, the nanocarpet (NC) formation by clustering of vertically aligned ZnO nanorods (NR) when water is dripped on their surface and then dried is studied for the first time by taking advantage of the possibility of tuning the surface water contact angle of the ZnO NR structure under UV preillumination. As a result, we demonstrate the feasibility of controlling the size and other morphological characteristics of the NCs. Moreover, a strong anisotropic wetting behavior, characterized by a Î”Î¿ = Î¿ âˆ¥ - Î¿ âŠ¥ = 30 Â°, is shown on an asymmetrically aligned NC surface resulting from arrays of tilted NRs. The study of the condensation/evaporation of water on/from an as-prepared (superhydrophobic) or a preilluminated (superhydrophilic) NR surface examined by an environmental scanning electron microscope has evidenced the formation of supported water droplets with polygonal shapes in the first case and the complete filling of the inter-NR space in the latter. The long-term stability of the NC clusters has been utilized as a footprint to track the penetration depth of water within the inter-NR space in the three borderline regions of water droplets. This analysis has shown that for moderately hydrophobic surfaces (i. e., water contact angles lower than 130 Â°) water droplets do not present a well-defined borderline trace but a spreading region where water penetrates differently with the NR interspace. The transition from a Cassie-Baxter to a modified Cassie-Baxter to finish in a Wenzel wetting state is found on these surfaces depending on the UV preillumination time and is explained with a model where water interaction with the <b>NR</b> <b>units</b> is the critical factor determining the macroscopic wetting behavior of these surfaces.

40|$|Structural, {{dynamical}} {{and optical}} properties of gold nanorod/DNA complexes for gene delivery applications Luca Digiacomo Supervisor: Giulio Caracciolo Internal supervisor: Stefano Luin Co-supervisor: Stefano Coppola Enhancement of the optical response by nanometric metallic systems (e. g. {{gold and silver}} nanoparticles) has raised large fundamental and technological interest during the past decade, due to their localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs). Such enhancement {{is associated with the}} collective resonant electron oscillation, that is driven by an external electromagnetic field. Gold nanorods (AuNRs) have broadly tunable LSPRs, which can be adjusted in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) range by acting on their shape, size, and composition. The geometrical aspects of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be modulated in the synthesis procedure. Generally for spherical objects, with the increase of the particle size the surface plasmon absorption maximum redshifts, when the shape of the particle changes from sphere-like to rod-like, a degree of anisotropy is introduced. As a consequence, the LSPR spectrum splits into two bands and the absorption spectrum strongly depends on the aspect ratio (i. e. the length-to-diameter ratio). Due to their interesting and versatile features, the high tolerability in living organisms and the ease of the functionalization, noble metal nanoparticles have several applications in different fields of nanotechnology, including surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, luminescence and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, biological imaging and biomedicine. The biosensing and biomedical potential of these metallic nanoparticles depends on how they interact with the NIR light and the biological environment. The size affects cellular uptake, diffusion and cytotoxicity. The shape mainly rules the plasmon resonance wavelengths, therefore the optical response. They can both be modulated in the synthesis procedure. Hence, an intriguing perspective is to gain a substantial control over the principal properties of these nanoparticles, efficiently and systematically, in order to optimize them for biotechnological applications. Our work is focused on the structural and optical analysis of the systems under study, involved in gold-nanoparticle-mediated gene delivery applications: the NR/DNA complexes represent a non-viral vector, the nucleic acid (DNA) within them is their cargo, which has to be protected during the cellular uptake, while the complexes overcome several extra- and intra-cellular barriers. Once efficiently internalized, the complexes have to traverse the cytoplasm and only in the proximity of the nucleus the DNA should be released. One of the most interesting aspects of gold nanorods is the controlled gene-payload release. It can be mediated and driven by the optical response of NRs to a laser beam, tuned at the wavelength of the localized surface plasmon resonance. The electronic excitations and the subsequent nonradiative decays induce an increase of the kinetic energy, a local overheating and a rapid and deep alteration of the structure. The bonds between nanoparticles and nucleic acid are broken and, as a consequence, the DNA is released. The formation of the complexes is a self-assembling process, driven by the Coulomb interaction between the nucleic acid and a shell of cationic surfactant, namely cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), which coats the gold nanorods. The nanoparticle functionalization with the surfactant is performed in the synthesis procedure. The size, charge, symmetry, geometrical and dynamical properties strongly depend on the molar ratio between their constituents, while the nanorod uniaxial anisotropy affects the optical response and defines the way that particles and DNA can be organized in three dimensions. In this work we investigate CTAB-capped gold nanorods and nanorod/DNA complexes, through the following experimental techniques. The trasmission electron microscopy represents the most direct approach to estimate size and shape of NRs. It provides high accuracy and allowed us to evaluate the CTAB-capped AuNR dimensions, as well as the slight deviation from the cylindrical geometry. The system azimuthal symmetry is peculiar in further analysis, i. e. synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments. The former provides an estimation of the NR optical element structure. Indeed, because of its intrinsic features, the synchrotron SAXS technique allowed us to investigate the gold core of the larger CTAB-gold <b>unit.</b> Then, <b>NR</b> length and radius have been related to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelengths, which have been measured by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. Further, we studied the NR dynamics through DLS, by measuring the translational and rotational brownian diffusion coefficients. The DLS approach represents also a relevant starting point for the NR/DNA complexes study. More precisely, the system symmetry affects the response to an incident light beam, thus it can be considered as a discriminating element for our analysis. We evaluated NR/DNA complexes symmetry, size and dynamics {{as a function of the}} component molar ratio and coupled them to the corresponding zeta potentials, which have been measured through electrophoretic light scattering (ELS). The most suitable complexes as drug delivery systems can be selected through this structural analysis, which allowed us to determine a specific molar ratio that corresponds to a class of potential gene delivery systems. Finally, we investigated the nucleic acid thermal stability through the UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, both for naked DNA and within the complexes. The Coulomb interaction between DNA and CTAB is responsible for the self-assembling process, but it slightly affects the nucleic acid secondary structure. This binding effect is however negligible in a temperature range wide enough to ensure the DNA stability for the expected application perspectives. The thesis is divided into 4 chapters. Chapter 1 underlines some physical aspects of gold nanoparticles and how the optical properties of noble metal systems are related to the nanobiotechnology. After a brief historical introduction, the application in gene delivery is presented, then the physical background of the surface plasmon resonance, the approximations adopted, the theories developed and the validity ranges are discussed. In Chapter 2 a presentation of the materials involved precedes the sections about the techniques adopted, within which the theoretical and experimental aspects are explained. All the results obtained are discussed in Chapter 3 and, finally, Chapter 4 gives a work overview, focused on the conclusions related to the experimental results and the consequent perspectives of application...|$|R
