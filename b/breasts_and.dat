40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The use of in vivo {{real time}} ultrasound (RTU) to predict <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> carcass weights and yields in 103 male broiler chickens was evaluated. Breast area (mm 2), thickness (mm) and volume (cm 3) were measured by RTU in three identified sites. After RTU measurements, the broiler chickens were weighed (LW) and slaughtered. Carcass <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> weights (g) <b>and</b> physical measures of breast area (mm 2), and thickness (mm) {{corresponding to the}} 3 identified sites, and volume (cm 3) were recorded. 2. The best simple correlation between RTU and carcass measurements was obtained for breast volume (r= 0. 866; P< 0. 01). <b>Breast</b> <b>and</b> carcass weights were well predicted by LW (r 2 = 0. 850 and r 2 = 0. 961, respectively; P< 0. 01). Furthermore, breast volume measured in carcass or by RTU were better in predicting <b>breast</b> weight <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> carcass yields (r 2 varied from 0. 879 to 0. 952; P< 0. 01). 3. Multiple regression equations were fitted using LW (g) and RTU measurement of breast volume to predict <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> carcass weights and yields.

40|$|Screening for <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> {{cervical}} cancers {{can reduce}} {{morbidity and mortality}} through early detection, yet many women are not getting regular lifesaving screenings as recommended. 2 The National <b>Breast</b> <b>and</b> Cervical Detection Program (NBCCEDP) was established in 1990 {{in order to provide}} low-income, uninsured, and underserved women access to <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancer screening and diagnostic services. Georgia’s participation in the NBCCEDP {{led to the development of}} The <b>Breast</b> <b>and</b> Cervical Cancer Program (BCCP), which provides cancer screening to women 40 to 64 years of age who are uninsured and/or underinsured and at or below 200 % poverty level. Deaths from <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancers could be avoided if screening rates increased among women at risk. In order to better eliminate barriers to screening, Georgia’s <b>Breast</b> <b>and</b> Cervical Cancer Program uses client navigators to communicate with minority populations. The purpose of my thesis study was to assess the effectiveness of the Client Navigator Program utilized to enhance <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancer screening rates for women throughout Georgia. Evaluation findings demonstrated that personal characteristics of Client Navigators, internal characteristics of the program itself, resources provided by the program, and program partnerships were the areas of greatest program strength.

40|$|The role of BRCA 1 in {{sporadic}} <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> ovarian cancers remains elusive, Direct {{involvement of}} BRCA 1 {{in the development}} of <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> ovarian cancer is suggested by the finding that the BRCA 1 promoter region CpG island is methylated in a proportion of <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> ovarian cancers. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the incidence of BRCA 1 promoter region methylation in tumours in which loss of BRCA 1 has been shown to play a role in pathogenesis (<b>breast</b> <b>and</b> ovarian carcinomas) with the incidence in tumours in which BRCA 1 is unlikely to play a role in pathogenesis. Promoter region hypermethylation was significantly more common (P < 0. 008) in <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> ovarian cancer (6 / 38 tumours methylated) than in colon cancer (0 / 35 tumours methylated) or in leukaemias (0 / 19 samples methylated). The restriction of BRCA 1 promoter region hypermethylation to <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> ovarian cancer is consistent with a pathogenetic role of BRCA 1 promoter methylation in these tumours, We suggest that the rarity of observed BRCA 1 mutations in sporadic <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> ovarian cancer is due to the greater likelihood of BRCA 1 inactivation by non-mutational mechanisms such :ts methylation...|$|R

A transcription of seventeen key informant interviews with prominent Hmong community members in Oregon was analyzed using content analysis. The participants’ responses reflected their beliefs about the entire Hmong community in Oregon. Several main themes emerged. First, key informants reported that the majority of Hmong use their friends and family as sources for general medical information, as well as information specific to <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancer. Secondly, Hmong individuals are reluctant to talk about <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancer due to cultural values. Lastly, many Hmong may be unaware of the importance of <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancer screenings. This study provides insight into an underdeveloped research area. These findings will be of use to future research that examines aspects of Hmong <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancer screening in greater depth...|$|R

Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> kowtowing to heaven. Illness could be cured in other ways as well, such as using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only of noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.|$|E

In an epigram on Chione, Martial strangely mentions a sex worker who went to the bathhouse in a bikini, while it was more natural to go unclothed.

5|$|Though {{there are}} {{standard}} descriptions of Dhumavati's form, some relatively recent paintings deviate from it. For example, an 18th-century painting by Molaram depicts Dhumavati {{sitting on a}} chariot pulled by two black scavenger birds with curved beaks. The painting follows the usual attributes like the winnowing basket, boon-giving gesture, but also depicts her young and beautiful with full <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> adorned in gold finery, {{a stark contrast to}} her usual form. An early 20th-century painting from Varanasi depicts her riding a crow, holding a trident, a sword, a winnowing fan, and a bowl in her four arms, dark-complexioned, with sagging breasts, wearing white clothes and with cremation flames in the background. She is again adorned in gold finery and wears a gold-hewn lower garment, unusual for a widow's dress. Another 18th century Nepali manuscript depicts a complete deviation from her traditional descriptions. She is completely nude with high breasts, wears a pearl necklace and headband, stands on a peacock with legs apart, and holds a mirror while looking at her reflection. A ring of fire surrounds her, possibly conveying cremation flames.|$|E
5|$|The Pranotasani Tantra narrates {{that once}} Parvati longed {{to go back}} to her {{maternal}} house for some days and asked Shiva's permission to do so. The reluctant Shiva agreed on the condition that if she did not return in a few days, he would come to fetch her. Parvati agreed and went to her father Himalaya's place, where she stayed for many days. The lovesick Shiva went to Himalaya's abode disguised as an ornament seller and sold shell ornaments to Parvati. In order to test her fidelity, the disguised Shiva asked for sex in return. The disgusted Parvati was about to curse the ornament-seller, when she realizes by her yogic powers that it was none other than Shiva. She agrees to grant sexual favours but at the appropriate time. In the evening, Parvati returns to Shiva's abode disguised as a Chandala huntress. She is dressed in red and had a lean figure and large <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> performs a seductive dance to lure him. She told Shiva that she had come to do penance. Shiva replied that he is the one gives fruit to all penance and took her hand and kissed her. Further, they made love when Shiva himself changed into a Chandala and recognized the Chandala woman as his wife. After the love-making, Parvati asked Shiva to grant her wish that her form as a Chandalini (the Chandala female form in which Shiva made love to her) might last forever as Ucchishta-Chandalini and that her worship in this form precede his for his worship to be considered fruitful. This tale is also found in many Bengali Mangalkavyas. In these texts, however, Parvati is not explicitly identified with Matangi.|$|E

40|$|IntroductionWest Virginia is {{the only}} state that lies entirely within Appalachia. West Virginians tend to be poorer and more likely to lack health {{insurance}} than the general U. S. population. The purpose of this qualitative study was to 1) obtain an understanding of attitudes about <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancer screening among women aged 25 to 64 years; 2) determine factors that motivate women to be screened for <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancer; and 3) evaluate educational materials about <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancer screening for use in this population. MethodsThe West Virginia <b>Breast</b> <b>and</b> Cervical Cancer Screening Program (WVBCCSP) is a comprehensive public health program, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, dedicated to removing barriers to <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancer screening and providing screenings to underserved women aged 25 to 64 years. The program partnered with RMS Strategies, Inc, to conduct six focus groups in three communities in West Virginia. Women were recruited by telephone based on program eligibility guidelines. ResultsResults indicated that women were concerned about health care costs and lack of health insurance. Cost, fear, and embarrassment were identified as the top barriers to <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancer screening. Participants believed that community-based educational campaigns would increase screening and promote use of the WVBCCSP. ConclusionUnderstanding why low-income Appalachian women do not get screened for <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancer and determining motivational factors that encourage screening are important to increase screening rates among this population. <b>Breast</b> <b>and</b> cervical cancer efforts that use the words, knowledge, and suggestions of the women they serve {{are more likely to be}} effective and have a larger impact...|$|R
