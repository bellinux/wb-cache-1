50|$|They fulfill {{numerous}} uses, including {{allowing the}} wires {{to be easily}} terminated to screw terminals, fast-on / quick-disconnect / spade-foot type terminals, wire splices, or various combinations of these. A tube-shaped connector with two crimps for splicing wires in-line is called a <b>butt</b> <b>splice</b> connector. Crimp-on connectors are attached by inserting the stripped end of a stranded wire into {{a portion of the}} connector, which is then mechanically deformed / compressed (crimped) tightly around the wire. The crimping is accomplished with special crimping pliers. A key idea behind crimped connectors is that the finished connection is gas-tight.|$|E
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{work has been done}} in the last years to improve the state of {{knowledge}} on fatigue behaviour of aluminium bolted joints, as well as the calculation methods and design standards. This paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed on ca 750 fatigue data reported in the literature or, more recently, obtained by several laboratories. All data are pertinent to friction and bearing-type aluminium <b>butt</b> <b>splice</b> bolted joints. In {{spite of the fact that}} a large number of factors could theoretically influence the fatigue behaviour and the failure modes of the joints (yield stress of the plates, type of bolts, bolt pattern, bolts to member ratio, nominal load ratio, surface finishing, plate thickness and so on), it will be demonstrated that all data can be summarized in a very reduced number of scatter bands the reference values of which, being related to different probabilities of survival, can be used for establishing trends, planning future research and for design purposes...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} the procedures, performance, and results {{obtained from the}} Field Joint Protection System (FJPS) rain test. This test was performed to validate that the flight configuration FJPS prevents the accumulation of moisture in the redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM) field joints when subjected to simulated prelaunch natural rain environments. The FJPS test article was exposed to rain simulation for approximately 50 minutes. During the test, water entered through the open {{upper end of the}} systems tunnel and was funneled down between the tunnel and case. A sealant void at the moisture seal <b>butt</b> <b>splice</b> allowed this water to flow underneath the FJPS. The most likely cause of voids was improper bondline preparation, particularly on the moisture seal surface. In total, water penetrated underneath approximately 60 percent of the FJPS circumference. Because the test article was substantially different from flight configuration (no systems tunnel closeout), results of this test will not affect current flight motors. Due to the omission of systems tunnel covers and systems tunnel floor plate closeout, the test assembly was not representative of flight hardware and resulted in a gross overtest. It is therefore recommended that the test be declared void. It is also recommended that the test be repeated with a complete closeout of the systems tunnel, sealed systems tunnel ends, and improved adhesive bondline preparation...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{components}} in bridges often require splicing {{of the bar}} reinforcing steel (rebar). Any rebar longer than the standard 18 m length (some rebars may be available in 24 m lengths) {{will need to be}} spliced either by: a) lap <b>splicing,</b> or b) <b>butt</b> <b>splicing.</b> <b>Butt</b> <b>splicing</b> is achieved either through the use of mechanical couplers or through welding, and such splicing shall conform t...|$|R
50|$|The {{benefits}} of automatic splicing {{add up to}} significantly increased productivity, greater quality control and reduced waste. It consists of a tail grabber and automatic diameter calculated splice initiation technique. The precision shear wheel and anvil mechanism guarantees a clean cut and no overlap. The splicing technique {{is divided into two}} major categories based on the type of joint, they are, <b>Butt</b> <b>splicing</b> where adhesives are used and Lap splicing:lap joint by means of applying heat and pressing it.|$|R

A. SCOPE The procedures used for determining the adequacy of mechanical <b>butt</b> <b>splices</b> (fabricated on the jobsite for job control tests or as presented by the manufacturer for prequalifying for usage on a highway construction job) for steel reinforcing bars are described in this test method...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{near-infrared}} lasers show remarkable {{progress in}} terms of output power, long running stability and cost. The development of laser precision plastic welding technology utilizing these laser sources as one of main applications has been actively conducted all over the world. The authors studied and developed brand-new laser splicing technology as a new application of laser welding for thermoplastic film material fed at roll-to-roll handling process, which showed better bonding quality compared to the conventional splicing methods such as adhesive tape method, heat sealing method, and so on. In this report, basic laser splicing method for transparent thermoplastic films, correlation between laser processing condition and bonding condition, how to measure heating situation when laser irradiated, in-process controlling method, moreover high precision and photon absorber-free laser <b>butt</b> <b>splicing</b> technology which is state-of-the-art laser welding technology is described...|$|R
40|$|According to {{a recent}} and {{appropriate}} definition, stress held parameters, namely notch stress intensity factors (N-SIFs), {{can be used to}} predict the fatigue behaviour of mechanical components weakened by V-shaped re-entrant corners, where the singularity in the stress distribution makes any failure criterion based on elastic peak stress no longer applicable. Commonly thought of as parameters able to control the fatigue crack initiation life, N-SIFs are, under certain circumstances, also useful for predicting the component total fatigue life. The fatigue strength of aluminium welded joints with different geometries and thicknesses are summarised in a single scatter band by using an N-SIF-based approach. The statistical analysis is carried out taking into account experimental data already reported in the literature, referring to welded joints with a thickness ranging from 3 to 24 mm. Results of steel and aluminium welded joints are then compared: at high number fatigue rife, the relative fatigue strength is slightly greater than 2, in agreement with the value previously reported in the literature for <b>butt</b> <b>spliced</b> bolted joints. The value of the theoretical exponent quantifying the scale effect (0. 326 against 0. 25 suggested by Eurocodes) is discussed...|$|R
