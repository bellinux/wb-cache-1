The shape and nature of these binding sites differ across and even within diverse hepatitis C virus genotypes.

To address this, we have established a hepatitis C virus mutant and genotypic recombinant polymerase panel as a means of guiding medicinal chemistry through the elucidation of the site of action of novel inhibitors and profiling against genotypes. Using a genotype 1 b backbone, we demonstrate that the recombinant P 495 L, M 423 T, M 414 T, and S 282 T mutant enzymes can be used to identify the binding site of an acyl pyrrolidine analog.

40|$|Follistatin binds and neutralizes {{members of}} the TGFβ {{superfamily}} including activin, myostatin, and growth and differentiation factor 11 (GDF 11). Crystal structure analysis of the follistatin-activin complex revealed extensive contacts between follistatin domain (FSD) - 2 and activin that was critical for the high-affinity interaction. However, it remained unknown whether follistatin residues involved with myostatin and GDF 11 binding were distinct from those involved with activin binding. If so, this would allow development of myostatin antagonists that would not inhibit activin actions, a desirable feature for development of myostatin antagonists for treatment of muscle-wasting disorders. We tested this hypothesis <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> of point and domain swapping follistatin mutants using competitive binding analyses and in vitro bioassays. Our results demonstrate that activin binding and neutralization are mediated primarily by FSD 2, whereas myostatin binding is more dependent on FSD 1, such that deletion of FSD 2 or adding an extra FSD 1 in place of FSD 2 creates myostatin antagonists with vastly reduced activin antagonism. However, these mutants also bind GDF 11, indicating that further analysis is required for creation of myostatin antagonists that will not affect GDF 11 activity that could potentially elicit GDF 11 -induced side effects in vivo...|$|R

40|$|MAP 1 B is a developmentally {{regulated}} microtubule-associated phosphoprotein {{that regulates}} microtubule dynamics in growing axons and growth cones. We used mass spectrometry to map 28 phosphorylation sites on MAP 1 B, and selected {{for further study}} a putative primed GSK 3 β site and compared it with two nonprimed GSK 3 β sites that we had previously characterised. We raised a panel of phosphospecific antibodies to these sites on MAP 1 B {{and used it to}} assess the distribution of phosphorylated MAP 1 B in the developing nervous system. This showed that the nonprimed sites are restricted to growing axons, whereas the primed sites are also expressed in the neuronal cell body.

These experiments identified dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK 1 A) as the kinase that primes sites of GSK 3 β phosphorylation in MAP 1 B, and we confirmed this by knocking down DYRK 1 A in cultured embryonic cortical neurons by using shRNA. DYRK 1 A knockdown compromised neuritogenesis and was associated with alterations in microtubule stability. These experiments demonstrate that MAP 1 B has DYRK 1 A-primed and nonprimed GSK 3 β sites that are involved in the regulation of microtubule stability in growing axons...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there are}} nearly 100 {{different}} causative genes identified for nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), Sanger sequencing-based DNA diagnostics usually only analyses three, namely, GJB 2, SLC 26 A 4, and OTOF. As this is seen as inadequate, {{there is a need}} for high-throughput diagnostic methods to detect disease-causing variations, including single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions/deletions (Indels), and copy-number variations (CNVs). In this study, a targeted resequencing panel for hearing loss was developed including 79 genes for NSHL and selected forms of syndromic hearing loss. One-hundred thirty one presumed autosomal-recessive NSHL (arNSHL) patients of Western-European ethnicity were analyzed for SNVs, Indels, and CNVs. In addition, we established a straightforward variant classification system to deal with the large number of variants encountered. We estimate that combining prescreening of GJB 2 <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> leads to a diagnosis in 25 %- 30 % of patients. Our data show that after GJB 2, the most commonly mutated genes in a Western-European population are TMC 1, MYO 15 A, and MYO 7 A (3. 1 %). CNV analysis resulted in the identification of causative variants in two patients in OTOA and STRC. One of the major challenges for diagnostic gene panels is assigning pathogenicity for variants.

40|$|Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), an {{autosomal}} dominant susceptibility syndroriie, for approximately 5 % of all colorectal tumours. Members of HNPCC families have a predisposition to the of colorectal cancer {{at an early}} age and an increased incidence of extracolonic cancer, e. g-, endometrium, ovaries, small bowel, biliary tract, renal pelvis and ureter. Gerrnline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, in particular MLI-Il and MSH 2, are present in individuals with I-INPCC. Defective DNA mismatch results in genetic instability, which can easily be observed in short repetitive sequences such as microsatellites instability, MSI). MSI has been detected in most MMR-deficient tumours and it is considered the of I-INPCC. An international workshop on MSI held in Bethesda in 1997 proposed a panel of live markers to be used in MSI analysis. This panel, lmown as "Bethesda markers", includes two reats (BAT 25, BAT 26) and three dinucleotide repeats (D 2 Sl 23, D 5 S 346 and Dl 7 S 250). ln our we are currently using a different microsatellite panel composed by three rnononucleotide repeats (BAT 25, BAT 40) and two dinucleoide repeats (D 2 Sl 23 and Dl 8 S 57). Aim of our study is to evaluate the speciticity of r Q Btllhcsda markers, as compared <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>panel,</b> to identify MLHI and MSI-I 2 mutation-positive HNPCC. We compared the results of MSI~analysis in tumours from 17 HNPCC families (according to and from 75 families in which not all the Amsterdam criteria were met (Suspected HNPCC), both the Bethesda <b>panel</b> and <b>our</b> alternative <b>panel.</b> MSI-H tumours were defined as having instability at two or markers (out of 5), while MSI-L tumours had instability at only one marker and MSS tumours were stable at all In addition, imrrninohistochemistry of MLH 1 and MSH 2 proteins was performed in all MSI-H and MSI-L to study the correlation between thc two MSI—panels and the expression of MLHI and MSH 2 proteins. Results. Using the Bethesda markers, 27 (36 %) out of the 75 Suspected HNPCC tumours and I 2 (70, 6 %) out of the HNPCC tumours showed MSI. On the other hand, using <b>our</b> alternative <b>panel,</b> 16 (21. 3 %) Suspected HNPCC and 7 (41, 2 %) HNPCC tumours displayed MSI. In Suspected HNPCC tumours we found I 5 (20 %) md 5 (6. 7 %) MSI., using the Bethesda <b>panel</b> and <b>our</b> alternative <b>panel</b> respectively, while in I-INPCC tumours no MSI-L was detected us either panel. Loss of MLHI or MSH 2 was evident in 15 out of 39 (38, 5 %) MSI tumours according to the Beth <b>panel,</b> whereas <b>with</b> <b>our</b> alternative <b>panel</b> 15 out of 23 (65. 2 %) MSI tumours showed no protein expression. Conclusions. Our data suggest that the Bethesda panel is more sensitive to defne MSI tumours, but the propose marker panel is more sensitive to identify MSI tumours lacking expression of MLHI and MSI-I 2 proteins. The marker panel seems to have higher predictive value in the identification of patients with ML!-Il and MSH 2 mutations...|$|R
