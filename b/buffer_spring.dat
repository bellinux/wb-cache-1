The <b>buffer</b> <b>spring</b> begins to push the bolt carrier and bolt back toward the chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides the bolt cam pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The bolt's locking lugs push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by feed ramps into the chamber.

50|$|In an Advanced Primer Ignition Blowback design {{such as the}} MK 108, {{this problem}} is {{prevented}} by using a longer chamber, which allows the cartridge {{to enter into the}} chamber a small distance past the breech face. When the trigger is pressed, the bolt is moved forward by expansion of the <b>buffer</b> <b>spring.</b> It chambers the cartridge, but instead of coming to rest against the breech face, it follows the case a small distance into the chamber. A cartridge case with a rebated rim is used, so that the extractor claw can hook over the rim and still fit within the chamber. Primer ignition is timed so that the bolt is still moving forward when the propellant is ignited. The expanding gases from the fired round stop the forward motion of the bolt, then reverse its motion, expelling it from the chamber, along with the spent cartridge case, which, as the bolt moves rearward, strikes the ejector, throwing it from the mechanism. The heavy bolt continues rearward, compressing the <b>buffer</b> <b>spring,</b> which then expands, pushing the bolt forward again, picking up a fresh cartridge from the magazine (or belt in a belt-fed weapon) and chambering it. This cycle of events continues until the trigger is released. Before this sequence of events occurs, the projectile has already left the muzzle, allowing the propellant gas to escape, reducing the chamber pressure to a safe level.|$|E

50|$|The {{design was}} based {{on two of the}} most popular machine pistols of the era. The {{external}} construction with a retractable butt and magazine mounted below the gun was borrowed from the successful German MP 40. The internal design of the mechanism was modeled after the British Sten. Blowback, with an open bolt, it offered good performance and high reliability. Unlike the Sten, and its Polish clone called the Polski Sten, it employed a free-floating firing pin and two springs behind the bolt - one served as the return spring and the other as the <b>buffer</b> <b>spring</b> (similar to the later Sterling submachine gun). The weapon was designed in this fashion so that resistance army members could use any captured stocks of German MP40 ammunition cartridges.|$|E

50|$|The {{driving wheels}} of the S6 had the rather unusual {{diameter}} of 2,100 mm {{in order to keep}} the rpm down and to guarantee the smooth running of the driving gear. Originally a diameter of 2,200 mm had been planned, but in the end it was reduced by 100 mm. The heavy balancing masses of the driving gear were badly affected by weight savings. That resulted in serious jerkiness when running. A remedy was achieved by coupling the tender closer to the locomotive and thus raising the compression of the <b>buffer</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The G 2/2+2/3 {{class had}} an {{external}} frame. The {{part of the}} chassis supporting {{the rear of the}} locomotive was pulled forward, and in the centre supported the rear bogie. The boiler was mounted forward of this point, and thus its rear was supported at fulcrum level. The locomotive had no pivot point, as a ball joint provided for steam injection. The bogie was connected with the chassis by pivot bearings, creating an articulated joint. In connection with this, there were two <b>buffer</b> <b>springs,</b> which, together with the centring springs of the mobile crosshead guides, counteracted any rolling of the bogie.|$|R
50|$|The division's {{attack on}} 1 July (the Battle of Gommecourt) was a costly failure. The {{artillery}} observers watched the infantry cross No-Man's Land, clear the German front-line trench {{and take the}} initial objectives, but German artillery retaliation and counter-attacks were intense, no reinforcements could cross No-Man's Land and no further progress could be made. The wire-cutting guns were now tasked with long-range fire into the enemy's rear areas, but the guns were worn out after the long bombardment, many were out of action with broken <b>buffer</b> <b>springs,</b> and their fire was ineffective.The division was pushed back into the German front-line trench and lost very heavily. Afterwards, its commander criticised the plan, especially the long-drawn-out artillery preparation, which allowed the enemy to prepare their response.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the trigger}} is pulled the slide is {{released}} and driven {{forward by the}} return spring, stripping a round from the magazine and feeding it into the chamber. As soon as the cartridge is lined up with the chamber the extractor grips the [...] and the gun fires while the slide is still moving forward. The firing impulse retards the forward movement of the slide and drives it back. The extractor grips the empty case until the ejector pushes it through the ejection port in {{the right of the}} slide. The slide continues to the rear and the return spring, located under the barrel, is fully compressed. The slide rides over a retarder lever which snaps up and holds the slide to the rear. The rate-reducing device, an inertia buffer {{in the rear of the}} slide, continues rearward under its own momentum and compresses the <b>buffer</b> <b>spring.</b> When the spring is fully compressed it throws the retarder forward and this pushes the retarder lever down out of engagement with the slide and, provided the trigger is still depressed and ammunition remains in the magazine, the slide goes forward to repeat the firing cycle.|$|E
50|$|The M82 is a short-recoil {{semi-automatic}} firearm. When {{the gun is}} fired, {{the barrel}} initially recoils for a short distance (about 1 in), while being securely locked by the rotating bolt. After the short travel lower part of acclerater arm held by receiver upper part is already hinged in bolt carrier and the middle portion strikes {{it back to the}} barrel by a rod place in bolt carrier transferring part of the recoil energy of the barrel to the bolt to achieve reliable cycling and unlock it from barrel.The bolt is unlocked by turning in the curved cam track in the bolt carrier.Then, the barrel is stopped By the combined effect of the accelerater, <b>buffer</b> <b>spring</b> and the muzzle braker and the bolt continues back, to extract and eject a spent case. On its return stroke, the bolt strips the fresh cartridge from the box magazine and feeds it into the chamber and finally locks itself to the barrel. The striker is also cocked on the return stroke of the bolt. The gun is fed from a large, detachable box magazine holding up to 10 rounds, although a rare 12-round magazine was developed for use during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{manufactured}} by the Industria National de Armas S.A. in São Paulo Brazil under license for Madsen. Production began in 1950. The first Model was marked M.B.-50 and was manufactured till 1953 and was {{marked with a}} large Brazilian crest. In late 1953 the Model 1953 was introduced. Improvements on the 1953 model were a larger magazine housing and a metal loop riveted to the lower {{right side of the}} magazine housing. The loop could then hold the magazine housing together. Also the retracting handle was changed on the Model 953 to the right side instead of the top as was the <b>buffer</b> <b>spring</b> and the shape of the extractor, ejector and the firing pin. The INA Model 53 is made of stamped sheet metal. It's an open bolt design which means it fires when the bolt is in the locked back open position with a fixed firing pin. The firearm is stamped from 2 pieces of sheet metal which are shaped with integral rear pistol grip and magazine housing. The two pieces fit together like a clam shell with the hinge {{at the rear of the}} pistol grip. It splits in half right down the middle of the top and bottom of the receiver. The entire firearm is held together with a barrel locking nut which is threaded onto the fore section of the two receiver halves. The folding stock is made of tubular steel and it folds onto the right side of the firearm.|$|E

The sensitivity and resolution load sensors analyzed based on configuration with various amount of loops, imperfection on the jacket, and imperfection at the cladding and core of polymer optical fiber. The results showed that the augment on the amount of load, imperfection on the jacket and imperfection on the sheath and core polymer optical fiber can improve the sensitivity and resolution of the load sensor. The best sensors resolution obtained on the number of loops 4 with imperfection 8 on the core and cladding polymer optical fiber that is 0. 037 V/N and 0, 026 N.

If selected, this feature mechanically controlled the rise and fall of the gun, elevating the gun for five rounds and then depressing it for four rounds. It lengthened the beaten zone by walking the fire in wave like motions up and down the range in a predefined area. The length of the beaten zone could be set on the Tiefenfeuerautomat. E.g., being unsure whether the real distance was 2000 or 2300 m, the gunner could make the mount do an automatic sweep between the elevations for 1900 to 2400 m and back. This sweeping of a selected beaten zone continued as long as the gun fired.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for {{water in the}} Canterbury region, and the realisation that spring flow {{plays an important role}} in many wetland and river systems, requires methods for predicting changes in spring behaviour as Canterbury's groundwater resources are utilised. This study into the flow of groundwater through artesian spring systems provides a better understanding of the impacts of changes in artesian aquifer pressure. The aquifer system of the central coastal Canterbury Plains consists of gravels separated by successive layers of fine sediment. The fine sediment acts as a confining aquitard, creating artesian pressures in the gravel aquifers where the piezometric surface is above ground level. Artesian springs occur in the confining aquitard through localised zones of weakness. Piezometric levels associated with artesian springs in gravel aquifers are not well documented and have never been observed in Canterbury. Examination of near-spring groundwater flow patterns should confirm the shallow artesian aquifer as the main source of water to artesian springs. Little information is available on the relationship between artesian aquifer pressure and artesian spring discharge. Groundwater flow equations indicate that turbulence occurs in the high velocity flow encountered in artesian spring systems. Energy losses should thus be proportional to velocity squared and the pressure - flow relationship is expected to be non-linear. A non-linear relationship would <b>buffer</b> <b>spring</b> discharge against changes in aquifer pressure induced by groundwater abstraction. Field investigations were carried out at two spring sites near Christchurch. Near-spring water levels were observed in the aquifer directly below the spring to confirm it as the principal source of water to the spring. Variations in artesian pressure were then induced via groundwater abstraction from nearby wells in the source aquifer, and changes in spring discharge measured. The upper confined aquifer was confirmed to be the primary source of water for Christchurch's artesian spring systems. The relationship between artesian aquifer pressure and artesian spring discharge was found to be entirely linear for the range of pressures and flows observed. Although theoretical analysis indicates that turbulent flow is occurring at, and close to, the spring vent, the distance over which it occurs is small enough that energy losses due to rapid flow in the groundwater system are negligible. The results imply that any reduction in artesian pressure due to groundwater abstraction will have a direct, linear impact on artesian spring flow...|$|E
