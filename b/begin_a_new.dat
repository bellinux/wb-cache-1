Published in 1888, the book was somewhat successful and had three reprints.|$|E
5|$|As {{the novel}} opens, Wadzek, {{owner of a}} factory that {{produces}} steam engines, is locked in a struggle with his more powerful rival Rommel, whose much larger company manufactures turbines. He {{can be seen as}} representing a new type of entrepreneur, more technologically advanced and less scrupulous than Wadzek. Losing value, the stock of Wadzek's company is being bought up by Rommel; in desperation, Wadzek teams up with Schneemann, an engineer working at one of Rommel's factories, to thwart his company's takeover by Rommel. This effort includes the misguided theft of some of Rommel's business correspondence. Fearing legal retribution for this theft, Wadzek, accompanied by Schneemann, flees with his wife Pauline and daughter Herta to his house in Reinickendorf, where the two men fortify the house in delusional preparation for a siege that never comes. Financially and spiritually broken, Wadzek returns to Berlin and with Schneemann attempts to turn himself in at a police station, where they learn that no warrant has even been issued for their arrest. There follows a temporary reconciliation with his estranged family and the first attempts to <b>begin</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> career in education—Wadzek would instruct his students in a new, moralistic and humane approach to technology. However, after walking in on an erotically and exotically charged debauch held in his own parlor (the aftermath of an African-themed birthday party Pauline held with her two new friends from Reinickendorf), Wadzek suffers a further breakdown. The novel ends aboard a ship bound for America, Wadzek eloping with Gaby, an old acquaintance and erstwhile lover of Rommel's, to <b>begin</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> life.|$|E

5|$|Editor Donald A. Wollheim {{was working}} at Avon Books in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade A. A. Wyn to <b>begin</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{paperback}} publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and pulp magazines under the name A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers. His magazines included Ace Mystery and Ace Sports, and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at Pyramid Books. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.|$|E
5|$|Following the brothers' falling out, Max {{had formed}} a new band, Soulfly, and Igor had {{recorded}} four studio albums with Sepultura before leaving the band in January 2006. In July 2006, Max received an unexpected call from his brother, {{and by the end}} of the conversation, Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix, Arizona, to perform in a Soulfly show.

To complete the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and the Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier to play bass guitar. The group then recorded their debut album at Undercity Studios in Los Angeles with engineer and co-producer Logan Mader in July 2007. Named after the band's original moniker, Inflikted was released through Roadrunner Records on 25 March 2008.|$|E

5|$|It {{is often}} {{reported}} that Eva traveled to Buenos Aires by train with tango singer Agustín Magaldi. However, biographers Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser maintain {{that this is}} unlikely, {{as there is no}} record of the married Magaldi performing in Junín in 1934 (and, even if he had, he usually traveled with his wife). Eva's sisters maintain that Eva traveled to Buenos Aires with their mother. The sisters also claim that Doña Juana accompanied her daughter to an audition at a radio station and arranged for Eva to live with the Bustamante family, who were friends of the Duarte family. While the method of Eva's escape from her bleak provincial surroundings is debated, she did <b>begin</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> life in Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Planula larvae exhibit {{positive}} phototaxis, swimming towards {{light to}} reach surface waters, where they drift and grow before descending {{to seek a}} hard surface to which they can attach and <b>begin</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> colony. They also exhibit positive sonotaxis, moving towards sounds that emanate from the reef and away from open water. High failure rates afflict many stages of this process, and even though millions of gametes are released by each colony, few new colonies form. The time from spawning to settling is usually two to three days, but can be up to two months. The larva grows into a polyp and eventually becomes a coral head by asexual budding and growth.|$|E
