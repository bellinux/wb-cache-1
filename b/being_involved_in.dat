40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the instructional leadership practices of a statewide sample of Arizona school superintendents. Superintendents' practices in 12 areas were analyzed in relation to the degree of district academic improvement over a three-year period, the relative size of the district, and the gender of the superintendent. Differences in principal-superintendent perceptions were also analyzed to determine the extent of these differences, and their correspondence to the level of academic improvement achieved by districts. Among superintendents that had served in the current district for at least three years, there were significant differences in their reported involvement in 2 of 12 areas. Superintendents in higher-performing districts reported <b>being</b> more <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> planning for instruction and developing principals as instructional leaders. While male and female superintendents reported similar instructional leadership practices, female superintendents reported <b>being</b> more <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> reviewing research and developing instructional policies. Male superintendents reported <b>being</b> more <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> developing principals as instructional leaders. Superintendents in districts of different sizes responded similarly to the survey. The one exception was in the area of supervising instruction, in which superintendents in medium-sized districts reported <b>being</b> less <b>involved.</b> There were significant differences in the views of superintendents' instructional leadership held by principals and superintendents. On the whole, principals perceived superintendents as <b>being</b> less <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> instructional leadership than did superintendents themselves. There were significant differences between the responses of the subjects of this study and Watts' 1992 study. Superintendents in the present study reported <b>being</b> significantly more <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> seven instructional leadership tasks than their 1992 counterparts. The findings from this study may be of use to superintendents as they consider the many responsibilities they face in providing leadership for their districts. These findings may also be of interest to researchers who are concerned with better understanding the instructional leadership role of the school superintendent...|$|R

5|$|Although the heme {{proteins}} are {{the most}} important class of iron-containing proteins, the iron-sulfur proteins are also very important, <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin, which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins, which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.|$|E
