50|$|Swedish company Interdynamic AB of Stockholm {{designed}} the Interdynamic MP-9 9mm submachine gun. Interdynamic intended {{it as an}} inexpensive submachine gun based on the Carl Gustav M/45 for military applications, but did not find a government buyer, so it {{was taken to the}} US market as an open-bolt semi-automatic pistol. The open-bolt design was deemed too easy to convert to full auto. Because of this, the ATF forced Interdynamic to redesign it into a closed-bolt system, which was harder to convert to full auto. This variant was called the KG-99. It made frequent appearances on Miami Vice, where it was legally converted to full auto by Title II manufacturers. The KG-9 and KG-99 have an open-end upper receiver tube where the bolt, recoil springs, and <b>buffer</b> <b>plate</b> are held in place by the plastic/polymer lower receiver frame. This design only allows for 115 grain 9mm ammunition. If heavier grain ammunition or hot loads are used, the plastic lower receiver will fail or crack, rendering the firearm unusable. The later model TEC-9 and AB-10 have a threaded upper receiver tube at the rear and a screw-on end cap to contain the bolt, recoil spring, and <b>buffer</b> <b>plate</b> even if removed from the lower receiver. This solves the problem of lower receiver failure when using hot ammo.|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of back-supported buffer plates comprising a solid face sheet and foam core backing impacted by {{a column of}} high velocity particles (sand slug) is investigated via a lumped parameter model and coupled discrete/continuum simulations. The <b>buffer</b> <b>plate</b> is either resting (unattached) or attached to a rigid stationary foundation. The lumped parameter model is used to construct maps of the regimes of behaviour with axes of {{the ratio of the}} height of the sand slug to core thickness and the normalised core strength. Four regimes of behaviour are identified based on whether the core compression ends prior to the densification of the sand slug or vice versa. Coupled discrete/continuum simulations are also reported and compared with the lumped parameter model. While the model predicted regimes of behaviour are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, the lumped parameter model is unable to predict the momentum transmitted to the supports as it neglects the role of elasticity in both the <b>buffer</b> <b>plate</b> and the sand slug. The numerical calculations show that the momentum transfer is minimised for intermediate values of the core strength when the so-called “soft-catch” mechanism is at play. In this regime the bounce-back of the sand slug is minimised which reduces the momentum transfer. For high values of the core strength, the {{response of}} the <b>buffer</b> <b>plate</b> resembles a rigid plate with nearly no impulse mitigation while at low values of core strength, a slap event occurs when the face sheet impinges against the foundation due to full densification of the foam core. This slap event results in a significant enhancement of the momentum transfer to the foundation. The results demonstrate that appropriately designed buffer plates have potential as impulse mitigators in landmine loading situations...|$|E
40|$|A vacuum {{pumping system}} is {{installed}} in a Closed Helical Divertor (CHD) in the Large Helical Device (LHD) at the National Institute for Fusion Science for active control of the peripheral plasma density and impurity suppression in the core plasma. In the CHD configuration, {{the distance between the}} pumping system and the divertor plates (heat and particle source) is very short (only ? 0. 1 m). One of the major issues in designing the pumping system is the reduction of heat load by radiation and thermal conduction due to the neutral particles being released from the heated divertor plates while keeping a high pumping efficiency. Here the heat load and the pumping efficiency are analyzed using a neutral particle transport simulation and a finite element method based software for multi-physics analysis. We propose a new design for a pumping system with an expanded area of the inlet of the water-cooled blinds and a bottom slit beneath the pumping system. This increases the pumping efficiency by approximately 60 % over that of our previous design. It also predicts that the increase in heat load on the pumping system for the new design would be reasonably suppressed by a <b>buffer</b> <b>plate</b> with high emissivity {{on the surface of the}} vacuum vessel on the inboard side of the torus...|$|E
40|$|Five {{serological}} assays: the <b>buffered</b> <b>plate</b> antigen test, {{the standard}} tube agglutination test, the complement fixation test, the hemolysis-in-gel {{test and the}} indirect enzyme immunoassay were diagnostically evaluated. Test data consisted of results from 1208 cattle in brucellosis-free herds, 1578 cattle in reactor herds of unknown infection status and 174 cattle from which Brucella abortus had been cultured. The complement fixation test had the highest specificity in both nonvaccinated and vaccinated cattle. The indirect enzyme immunoassay, if interpreted at a high threshold, also exhibited a high specificity in both groups of cattle. The hemolysis-in-gel test had a very high specificity when used in nonvaccinated cattle but quite a low specificity among vaccinates. With {{the exception of the}} complement fixation test, all tests had high sensitivities if interpreted at the minimum threshold. However, the sensitivities of the standard tube agglutination test and indirect enzyme immunoassay, when interpreted at high thresholds were comparable to that of the complement fixation test. A kappa statistic was used to measure the agreement between the various tests. In general the kappa statistics were quite low, suggesting that the various tests may detect different antibody isotypes. There was however, good agreement between the <b>buffered</b> <b>plate</b> antigen test and standard tube agglutination test (the two agglutination tests evaluated) and between the complement fixation test and the indirect enzyme immunoassay when interpreted at a high threshold. With the exception of the <b>buffered</b> <b>plate</b> antigen test, all tests were evaluated as confirmatory tests by estimating their specificity and sensitivity on screening-test positive samples.

40|$|Ramp loading using graded density impactors as flyers in gas-gun-driven plate impact {{experiments}} {{can yield}} new and useful {{information about the}} equation of state and the strength properties of the loaded material. Selective Laser Melting, an additive manufacturing technique, was used to manufacture a graded density flyer, termed the “bed-of-nails” (BON). A 2. 5 -mm-thick ×× 99. 4 -mm-diameter solid disc of stainless steel formed a base for an array of tapered spikes of length 5. 5 mm and spaced 1 mm apart. The two experiments to test the concept were performed at impact velocities of 900 and 1100 m/s using the 100 -mm gas gun at the Institute of Shock Physics at Imperial College London. In each experiment, a BON flyer was impacted onto a copper <b>buffer</b> <b>plate</b> which helped to smooth out perturbations in the wave profile. The ramp delivered to the copper buffer was in turn transmitted to three tantalum targets of thicknesses 3, 5 and 7 mm, which were mounted {{in contact with the}} back face of the copper. Heterodyne velocimetry (Het-V) was used to measure the velocity–time history, at the back faces of the tantalum discs. The wave profiles display a smooth increase in velocity over a period of ∼ 2. 5 μs∼ 2. 5 μs, with no indication of a shock jump.

40|$|AbstractRocket {{propelled}} grenade (RPG) shaped charge attack {{threats are}} of particular concern for Insensitive Munitions (IM) development. In response to these threats, the U. S. Project Engineering Office for Ammunition (PEO Ammo) have worked with the U. S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) Energetics and Warheads Division (EWD) to develop a highly reproducible and well characterized standardized 81 mm shaped charge jet initiation test configuration. This 81 mm shaped charge and jet attack configuration is used to determine whether an acceptable explosion or lower level response is observed. The test is completed as per STANAG 4526. The 81 mm shaped charge is comprised of a high precision forged and machined liner made from C 101 Oxygen Free Copper (OFE, UNS C 10100) and a bare billet LX- 14 pressed billet configuration that is machined to final dimensions. This warhead choice overcomes the issue of testing variability observed if actual production RPGs are used for Insensitive Munitions (IM) threat testing. The test configuration includes an aluminum <b>buffer</b> <b>plate</b> {{that is used to}} condition the jet for desired jet characteristics, as well as a representation for RPG probe position. Modeling and simulation was used to develop the shaped charge and test configuration. The resulting configuration has been experimentally characterized using flash radiography for short and long stand-off in order to provide quantified jet characterization including velocity profiles, accumulated length, accumulated mass, jet diameter and v 2 d profiles. The result is a simple reproducible test configuration that represents an RPG attack geometry. The test configuration has been adopted by the U. S.

Traditional gun launch techniques include use of <b>buffer</b> <b>plates,</b> such as fused silica, that exhibit negative curvature to their stress-strain response and graded-density impactors. Graded-density impactors have been used to study isentropic compression of specimens to pressures exceeding 2 Mbar on high-impedance materials. A recent development includes the use of the Sandia Z Accelerator to produce magnetic compression in planar specimens to pressures of a few hundred kbar over time scales of 100 ns. These techniques have been successfully applied to isentropic compression of iron to 300 kbar and copper to 130 kbar. The iron results indicate {{that it is possible to}} study the polymorphic phase change that occurs at 130 kbar and also the kinetic properties of the transformation. The copper results indicate that with further improvements in progress it should be possible to measure continuous isentropic compression curves in materials of interest to pressures exceeding 1 Mbar. The Z accelerator is limited to peak currents of about 20 MA. By reconfiguring the anode-cathode geometry it should be possible to obtain constant current density and thus driving pressure to about 3 Mbar.

40|$|We {{consider}} quasistatic {{fiber bundle}} models with weak interactions, i. e. where the perturbation emanating from every broken fiber is {{small compared to}} the mean-field imposed average deformation of the bundle. Classical load sharing rules are considered, namely purely local, purely global or decaying as a power-law of distance.

Initially, all fibers are intact and as the <b>buffer</b> <b>plates</b> are progressively separated, with a controlled displacement between them, fibers break one after the other.

Using a perturbational approach allows to obtain this configurational distribution exactly to leading order in the interactions. This maps this fiber bundle systems onto classical statistical mechanics models, namely percolation, standard Ising models or generalized Ising models depending on the range of the interactions chosen in the load sharing rule. This relates unambiguously such q. d. based systems to standard classical mechanics, which allows the use of the associated toolbox to derive various observables of the system, as e. g. correlation lengths. The thermodynamic parameters formally equivalent to temperature and chemical potential, are analytically expressed functions of the externally imposed deformation, with functional dependences depending on the load sharing rule and the particular choice of the q. d. distribution. ...|$|R

The modern methods are based on primary binding assays of which a competitive enzyme immunoassay (CELISA) and fluorescence polarization (FPA) are the best developed. For antibodies to R- Brucella sp. a rapid slide agglutination (RSAT) as screening and an indirect ELISA (IELISA) as confirmatory tests have been reported. We have selected 23 cases of human brucellosis that were followed up over a long period, to assess which test was most effective in detecting different stages of the disease. The patients were divided into five groups: chronic cases; relapses; infection acquired in a laboratory; patients presumptively infected with B. canis and cases with a long history of brucellosis. The results suggest that BPAT is a practical test that reduces non specific reactions and is more sensitive than RBT. SAT detects the acute form but cross reacts with other antibodies and the diagnostic end-point titre has not been satisfactorily established; 2 MET should be discontinued because of its toxicity and the scant information it can add; CFT fails to detect the acute form and is technically complicated. CELISA correlate well with the clinical course and is useful to detect acute as well as chronic cases and FPA do not work in serum with high lipid content.

Of the six common Brucella species, Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus, and B. suis are the commonest species occurring in China. To develop an ELISA assay that can differentiate between cows inoculated with B. suis S 2 and naturally infected with B. abortus and B. melitensis, genomic sequences from six Brucella spp. (B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, Brucella canis, Brucella neotomae and Brucella ovis) were compared using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool software. One particular gene, the repA-related gene, {{was found to}} be a marker that can differentiate B. suis from B. abortus and B. melitensis. The repA-related gene of B. suis was PCR amplified and subcloned into the pET- 32 a vector. Expressed repA-related protein was purified and used as an antigen. The repA-based ELISA was optimized and used as specific tests. In the present study, serum from animals inoculated with the B. suis S 2 vaccine strain had positive repA-based ELISA results. In contrast, the test-positive reference sera against B. abortus and B. melitensis had negative repA-based ELISA results. The concordance rate between B. abortus antibody-negative (based on the repA-based ELISA) and the Brucella gene-positive (based on the 'Bruce ladder' multiplex PCR) was 100 %. Therefore, the findings suggest that the repA-based ELISA is a useful tool for differentiating cows vaccinated with the B. suis S 2 and naturally infected with B. abortus and B. melitensis...|$|R
40|$|The {{screening}} Rose Bengal test (RBT), the <b>buffered</b> <b>plate</b> agglutination test (BPAT), and the confirmatory {{complement fixation}} test (CFT) are currently approved by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) for diagnosis of goat brucellosis. However, RBT (at 3 % or 8 % cell concentration) {{is known to be}} affected by vaccinal antibodies. In the present study, Mexican and Canadian OIE tests were compared with the fluorescence polarization assay (FPA), alone or in combination, using indirect and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays as classification variables for goat sera obtained from an area of high prevalence and widespread vaccination. The relative sensitivities and specificities were, respectively, 99. 7 % and 32. 5 % for RBT 3, 92. 8 % and 68. 8 % for RBT 8, 98. 4 % and 84. 8 % for Canadian CFT, 83. 7 % and 65. 5 % for Mexican CFT, and 78. 1 % and 89. 3 % for FPA. The use of FPA as the confirmatory test in combination with other tests significantly increased the final specificities of the screening tests alone; BPAT, RBT 3, and RBT 8 plus FPA resulted in final specificities of 90 %, 91. 2 %, and 91. 3 %, respectively, whereas for the combinations RBT 3 plus Mexican CFT, RBT 8 plus Mexican CFT, and BPAT plus Canadian CFT, specificities were 65. 5 %, 63. 2 %, and 91. 7 %, respectively. We suggest that FPA may be routinely applied as an adaptable screening test for diagnosis of goat brucellosis and as a confirmatory test for screening test series. Some advantages of FPA are that its cutoff can be adjusted to improve its sensitivity or specificity, it is a low-cost and easy-to-perform test of choice when specificity is relevant or when an alternative confirmatory test is not available, and it is not affected by vaccination, thus reducing the number of misdiagnosed and killed goats...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of the fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) using the recently described Brucella melitensis native hapten and the Brucella abortus O-polysaccharide tracer was evaluated and {{compared with those of}} The World Organization for Animal Health tests related to indirect and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays as classification variables for goat sera obtained from a high-prevalence area where vaccination was performed; test series were also evaluated to increase the final specificity of the tests. Our results showed that the respective relative sensitivity and specificity were 99. 7 % and 32. 5 % for the rose Bengal test with a 3 % cell concentration (RBT 3), 92. 8 % and 68. 8 % for the rose Bengal test with 8 % cell concentration (RBT 8), 98. 4 % and 84. 9 % for the Canadian complement fixation test (CFT), 83. 7 % and 65. 5 % for the Mexican CFT, 98. 4 % and 81. 0 % for the <b>buffered</b> <b>plate</b> agglutination test (BPAT), and 78. 1 % and 89. 3 % for the fluorescence polarization assay (FPA). The use of the FPA as the secondary test significantly increased the final specificities of test combinations; the screening tests BPAT, RBT 3, and RBT 8 plus FPA resulted in 90 %, 91. 2 %, and 91. 3 % final specificities, respectively, whereas for the combinations RBT 3 plus Mexican CFT, RBT 8 plus Mexican CFT, and BPAT plus Canadian CFT, the specificities were 65. 5 %, 63. 2 %, and 91. 7 %, respectively. The results suggested that the FPA may be routinely applied as an adaptable screening test for diagnosis of goat brucellosis, since its cutoff can be adjusted to improve its sensitivity or specificity, it is a rapid and simple test, it can be the test of choice when specificity is relevant or when an alternative confirmatory test is not available, and it is not affected by vaccination, thus reducing the number of goats wrongly slaughtered due to misdiagnosis...|$|R
30|$|Simultaneously, {{based on}} the FPase activity, the {{prominent}} UV mutant strains were further subjected to chemical mutagenesis treatment. For this, the culture suspension was prepared following similar method as described above. To 5  mL of cell suspension containing ~ 105 – 106  mL− 1 viable cells, 5  mL of sterile ethyl methyl sulfonate (EMS) reagent (stock solution of 200  μg mL− 1) was added. The cells were withdrawn from the reaction mixture at regular intervals of 15 -, 30 -, 60 -, 90 -, 120 - and 150 -min. After the treatment period, to arrest the reaction samples were diluted immediately with sterile phosphate buffer (50  mM, pH 7). The suspended samples were then centrifuged at 5, 000  rpm for 10  min and cells were harvested and washed three times with sterile distilled water to remove traces of EMS reagent. The cells were serially diluted in phosphate <b>buffer</b> and <b>plated</b> for screening following the similar protocol as described above. EMS treated UV mutant microbial colonies were then ranked, selected from the plates and were tested for cellulase production as mentioned below.|$|R
30|$|The {{membrane}} preparations were thawed and incubated in {{the binding}} buffer containing 0.1  % bovine serum albumin, 1  nM [3 H]N-α-methylhistamine (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) with various concentrations of a dihydroquinolinone derivative (i.e., test compound) at 25  °C for 1  h. The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration through 96 -well GF/C filter plates (PerkinElmer) presoaked with 0.5  % polyethyleneimine (Wako, Osaka, Japan). After washes with ice-cold binding <b>buffer,</b> the <b>plates</b> were dried {{and filled with}} Microscint-o (PerkinElmer). The radioactivity retained on the filters was counted using a TopCount NXT (PerkinElmer). Total and nonspecific radioligand binding was determined by reaction without and with 10  μM thioperamide and clobenpropit, respectively. The specific radioligand binding was then calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding. The IC 50 value for inhibition of the radioligand binding by the test compound was determined using a nonlinear fit of the concentration-response curve for each test compound using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Data were expressed as the geometric means of IC 50 values from three independent experiments run in duplicate.|$|R
40|$|An {{indirect}} {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (IELISA), {{a competitive}} ELISA (CELISA), and a fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) for the presumptive serological diagnosis of swine brucellosis were evaluated using two populations of swine sera: sera from brucellosis-free Canadian herds and sera from Argentina selected based on positive reactions in the <b>buffered</b> antigen <b>plate</b> agglutination test (BPAT) and the 2 -mercaptoethanol (2 -ME) test. In addition, sera from adult swine from which Brucella suis was isolated at least once for each farm of origin were evaluated. The IELISA, CELISA, and FPA specificity values were 99. 9, 99. 5, and 98. 3 %, respectively, and the IELISA, CELISA, and FPA sensitivity values relative to the BPAT and the 2 -ME test were 98. 9, 96. 6, and 93. 8 %, respectively. Actual sensitivity was assessed by using 37 sera from individual pigs from which B. suis was cultured, and the values obtained were as follows: BPAT, 86. 5 %; 2 -ME test, 81. 1 %; IELISA, 86. 5 %; CELISA, 78. 5 %; and FPA, 80. 0 %...|$|R

40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out on caprine {{brucellosis}} in a costal area in Egypt. A total number of 577 Baladi Does was examined for Brucella infection using different serological tests. Specimens were taken from seropositive obligatory slaughtered Does (No = 33) for Brucella isolation, histopathological examination, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay and determination of serum copper (Cu), zinc(Zn) and iron (Fe) concentrations. Results indicated {{that the incidence of}} brucellosis was 3. 0 - 5. 0 %, by using the different serological tests. <b>Buffered</b> Acidified <b>Plate</b> Antigen Test (BAPAT) is of the highest sensitivity followed by Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT), L-ELISA, Complement Fixation Test (CFT), P-ELISA, Rivanol test (RVT) and Tube Agglutination Test (TAT).
