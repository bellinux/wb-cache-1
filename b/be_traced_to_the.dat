The village contains a number of listed buildings, which include a 12th-century church, an old mill house and two oast houses.|$|E
5|$|During the Zheng and Qing eras, Han {{immigrants}} brought Confucianized {{beliefs of}} Taoism and Buddhism to Taiwan's indigenous people. Many Plains Aborigines adopted Han religious practices, {{though there is}} evidence that many aboriginal customs were transformed into local Taiwanese Han beliefs. In some parts of Taiwan the Siraya spirit of fertility, Ali-zu (A-li-tsu) has become assimilated into the Han pantheon. The use of female spirit mediums (tongji) can also <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> earlier matrilineal Inibs.|$|E

5|$|Syracuse University (commonly {{referred}} to as Syracuse, 'Cuse, or SU) is a private research university in Syracuse, New York, United States. The institution's roots can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Genesee Wesleyan Seminary (later becoming Genesee College), founded in 1831 by the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima, New York. After several years of debate over relocating the college to Syracuse, the university was established in 1870, independent of the college. Since 1920, the university has identified itself as nonsectarian, although it maintains a relationship with The United Methodist Church.|$|E

According to the Supetar Cartulary, they were one of six tribes which selected bans who, in turn, elected a new king in a case where the prior king died without leaving heirs.|$|E

5|$|The {{birth of}} the Smithsonian Institution can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{acceptance}} of James Smithson's legacy, willed to the United States in 1826. Smithson died in 1829, and in 1836, President Andrew Jackson informed Congress of the gift, which it accepted. In 1838, Smithson's legacy, which totaled more than $500,000, was delivered to the United States Mint and entered the Treasury. After eight years, in 1846, the Smithsonian Institution was established.|$|E
5|$|The {{daffodil}} and the leek {{are also}} symbols of Wales. The {{origins of the}} leek can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd-George. This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen, and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Jens Wehner {{notes that}} the German-language version of the book was immensely popular in Germany, but contained serious flaws in terms of presentation of historical realities. These included the uncritical borrowing from the Nazi propaganda elements of the Fliegerasse ("aces") and stereotypes about the Soviet Union. According to Wehner, the latter could <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prevailing attitudes during the Cold War. Further, {{the political and social}} consequences of World War II were completely ignored.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Languedoc wines can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first {{vineyards}} planted {{along the coast}} near Narbonne by the early Greeks in the fifth century BC. Along with parts of Provence, these are the oldest planted vineyards in France. The region of Languedoc has belonged to France since the thirteenth century and the Roussillon was acquired from Spain in the mid-seventeenth century. The two regions were joined as one administrative region in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Almirante Latorres genesis can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{numerous}} naval arms races between Chile and Argentina, {{which in}} turn were spawned by territorial disputes over their mutual borders in Patagonia and Puna de Atacama, along with control of the Beagle Channel. Naval races flared up in the 1890s and in 1902; the latter was eventually settled via British mediation. Provisions in the dispute-ending treaty imposed restrictions on both countries' navies. The United Kingdom's Royal Navy bought the two Constitución-class pre-dreadnought battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold its two Rivadavia-class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan.|$|E
5|$|Athens {{became a}} center for music in the region during the Civil War and gained further fame {{in the early twentieth}} century with the {{founding}} of the Morton Theatre, which was a major touring destination for African American performers. The city's local rock music scene can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, with live music at Allen's Hamburgers in Normaltown. International attention came in the 1970s when the B-52's began releasing the first of several best-selling recordings. Athens-based rock bands have performed in a wide array of styles, and the city has never had a characteristic style of rock; most of the bands have been united only in their quirky and iconoclastic image.|$|E

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{the stability of}} various oxides of K and find that K(2) O(2) is the most stable one. <b>The</b> additional stability <b>is</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presence of oxygen dimers in K(2) O(2) which interact to form molecular orbitals. Other oxides such as KO(2) and KO(3) which also have dimers/trimers of oxygens {{are found to be}} less stable. This <b>is</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shorter O-O bonds that one finds in them which gives rise to a significant coulomb repulsion between the electrons on the oxygen atoms making up the dimer/trimer, making them less stable...|$|R

5|$|In {{the field}} of 20th-century popular music, Baltimore first was a major center for the {{development}} of East Coast ragtime, producing the legendary performer and composer Eubie Blake. Later, Baltimore became a hotspot for jazz, and a home for such legends in the field as Chick Webb and Billie Holiday. The city's jazz scene can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early part of the 20th century, when the style first spread across the country. Locally, Baltimore was home to a vibrant African American musical tradition, which included funereal processions, beginning with slow, mournful tunes and ending with lively ragtime numbers, very similar to the New Orleans music that gave rise to jazz.|$|E

5|$|NFL postseason {{history can}} <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first NFL Championship Game in 1933, {{though in the}} early years, {{qualification}} for the game was based solely on regular season records. From 1933 to 1966, the NFL postseason generally only consisted of the NFL Championship Game, pitting the league's two division winners (pending any one-game playoff matches {{that needed to be}} held to break ties in the division standings). The NFL playoffs then expanded in 1967, when four teams qualified for the tournament. When the league merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970, the playoffs expanded to eight teams. The playoffs were expanded to 10 teams in 1978 and 12 teams since 1990.|$|E
