5|$|The French {{squadron}} {{had become}} disorganised in its initial pursuit the British, with Manche, under Captain Jean Dornal de Guy, falling substantially to leeward of the flagship. Seeing this, Stewart realised {{that the best}} hope his convoy had of survival was to unite and attack Manche together. The combined batteries of the East Indiamen could be deployed en masse, hopefully inflicting enough damage to drive Manche away and discourage Hamelin in Vénus from attacking alone. Signalling his intentions to the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom, Stewart turned towards Vénus and <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> her. Hamelin, realising the threat his scattered squadron faced, signalled for his ships to join up. With the wind against him however, {{it was obvious that}} Windham would reach Manche first.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00, {{a breeze}} pushed Boadicea forward {{and she began}} to close with her former consort, Rowley {{watching}} as all three of Africaines masts gave way and collapsed over the side one by one. By 08:00, Africaine was a dismasted hull and Corbet was dead {{in the bowels of the}} ship, although the exact manner of his death was to cause lasting controversy. By 10:00, Boadicea had been joined by Otter and Staunch and <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the French ships and their prize, so that by 15:30 Bouvet was persuaded to abandon Africaine and tow the damaged Iphigénie back to Port Napoleon. By 17:00, Boadicea pulled alongside Africaine and the French prize crew surrendered. Rowley later reported that a number of British sailors leaped into the sea at his approach and swam to Boadicea, requesting that they be allowed to pursue the French ships in the hope of capturing one.|$|E
5|$|Behind this combat, {{other ships}} of the centre {{division}} struck the French line, HMS Valiant under Thomas Pringle passing close to Patriote which pulled away, her crew suffering from contagion {{and unable to}} take their ship into battle. Valiant instead turned her attention on Achille, which had already been raked by Queen Charlotte and Brunswick, and badly damaged her before pressing on sail to join the embattled van division. HMS Orion under John Thomas Duckworth and HMS Queen under Admiral Alan Gardner both attacked the same ship, Queen suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Both ships <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the French Northumberland, which was soon dismasted and left attempting to escape on only the stump of a mast. Queen was too slow to engage Northumberland as closely as Orion, and soon fell in with Jemmappes, both ships battering each other severely.|$|E
60|$|John went home, {{after three}} days spent in Newport, feeling that Lillie was somehow an injured fair one, and that the envious world <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> always <b>on</b> beauty and prosperity.|$|R
60|$|Just {{then there}} burst upon their ears the yell of a steam-whistle, {{and a few}} moments later a steamer <b>bore</b> {{straight}} <b>down</b> <b>on</b> them, astern.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{changed my}} course at once; <b>bore</b> {{straight}} <b>down</b> <b>on</b> her, an' soon overhauled her, but the nearer I came the more did my courage run out, so I gradooally {{begun to take}} in sail an drop astarn. At last I got savage, `You're a fool, Jenkins!' says I to myself. `That's a fact!' says su'thin' inside o' me.|$|R
5|$|Sailors {{on nearby}} ships heard {{the series of}} signals and, realizing that a {{collision}} was imminent, gathered to watch as Imo <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Mont-Blanc. Though both ships had cut their engines by this point, their momentum carried them {{right on top of}} each other at slow speed. Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock that would set off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered Mont-Blanc to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the Norwegian ship's bows in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship's height in the water and the transverse thrust of her right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into Mont-Blanc. Imos prow pushed into the French vessel's No. 1 hold on her starboard side.|$|E
25|$|Pushing down {{further into}} the Plain of Jars with their {{heaviest}} yet forces of the war, the communists <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the main Hmong bases of Long Chieng and Sam Thong. When they came within ten kilometers of the bases, all able-bodied males within them were armed. Dependent Hmong families began {{to sleep in the}} woods at night, hoping to evade any ground assault.|$|E
25|$|At about 08:00 the Allies, {{being to}} windward, ran down {{together}} in line abreast, elongated {{in order to}} cover the whole French fleet and prevent doubling at either end. The Dutch squadron <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the leading French squadron to engage on a parallel course but left the leading division of Château-Renault's squadron unmarked. This division cut across Evertsen's path and doubling on the Dutch squadron, was able to inflict much loss.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{sister ship}} CSS Raleigh {{was also a}} hard-luck ironclad. After serving in the Confederate Navy for just one week, Raleigh ran heavily aground on a sandbar called [...] "the Rip." [...] Her tonnage <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> heavily <b>on</b> the ships {{unsupported}} aft keel, the pressure finally [...] "breaking her back," [...] as the tide receded; the ironclad was declared a total loss and her cannon, iron armor, and steam power plant were salvaged.|$|R
6000|$|A {{few minutes}} later a pleasant-looking but dignified lady came out from among the tea-drinkers and <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> {{directly}} <b>on</b> me. [...] "I hear," [...] she said, [...] "you've been talking to my little girl, and I {{want you to know}} I was very sorry I couldn't let her paddle. She was just recovering from whooping-cough when I took her to the seaside, and I was afraid to let her go in the water." ...|$|R
60|$|The fellow nodded; {{and taking}} {{her in his}} arms, {{notwithstanding}} her broken protestations, and her struggles (which latter species of opposition, involving scratches, was much more difficult of resistance), carried her away. They {{who were in the}} house poured out into the street; the locksmith was taken {{to the head of the}} crowd, and required to walk between his two conductors; the whole body was put in rapid motion; and without any shouts or noise they <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> straight <b>on</b> Newgate, and halted in a dense mass before the prison-gate.|$|R
25|$|Forbes {{was given}} command the 80-gun third-rate HMS Norfolk in 1742 and saw {{action at the}} Battle of Toulon on 11 February 1744 during the War of the Austrian Succession. He {{followed}} the example of Admiral Thomas Mathews, who was aboard the second-rate HMS Namur, {{and was one of}} the few captains who really <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the enemy. In Summer 1746 he was called upon to give evidence at the court-martial of Vice-Admiral Richard Lestock during the recriminations after the battle.|$|E
25|$|Deploying on {{both sides}} of the main highway, Milhaud charged Blake's cavalry and routed it. As the Spanish {{horsemen}} galloped away, they disrupted their own infantry formations. When the French dragoons and Polish lancers <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the surprised and shaken Spanish foot soldiers, the men scattered in flight. Milhaud's horsemen cut Blake's vanguard to pieces, cutting down many soldiers and capturing many prisoners. But when the French encountered the second Spanish division drawn up in rough terrain, they refrained from attacking. Blake immediately ordered a retreat to Cúllar.|$|E
25|$|At 04:00 on 24 June, at {{position}} , almost the midpoint between Menorca and Toulon, the frigate squadrons sighted one another. Dido, the leading British ship, sent coded {{signals to the}} French, who failed to answer, confirming their nationality. As the British advanced, the French tacked away, and rapidly outdistanced the British ships. At 08:00 however with visibility improving, the diminutive size of the British ships became apparent and the French squadron turned back and <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Dido and Lowestoffe. At 08:30, Minerve {{was close enough to}} Dido to fire a broadside, although Towry elected not to return fire until Minerve had closed further. By 08:45 he had successfully manoeuvered into a position in front of Perrée's bow and fired at close range.|$|E
60|$|The {{laugh with}} which this {{question}} was greeted was suddenly {{arrested by the}} sound of a galloping steed. Every one sprang up and instinctively seized a weapon, for the clatter of hoofs had that unmistakable character which indicates desperate urgency. It was low and dull at first, but became suddenly and sharply distinct as a rider rose over the ridge to the left and <b>bore</b> madly <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the camp, lashing his horse with furious persistency.|$|R
60|$|Passion long {{contained}} {{burst in}} Kurt. He tasted the salt {{of his own}} blood where he had bitten his lips. Nash showed as in a red haze. Kurt had {{to get his hands}} on this German, and when he did it liberated a strange and terrible joy in him. No weapon would have sufficed. Hardly aware of Nash's blows, Kurt tore at him, swung and choked him, <b>bore</b> him <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the bank, and there beat him into a sodden, bloody-faced heap.|$|R
5000|$|The yoke of Latin grammar writing <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> oppressively <b>on</b> much of {{the early}} history of English grammars. Any attempt by one author to assert an {{independent}} grammatical rule for English was quickly followed by equal avowals by others of truth of the corresponding Latin-based equivalent. [...] Even as late as the early nineteenth century, Lindley Murray, the author {{of one of the most}} widely used grammars of the day, was having to cite [...] "grammatical authorities" [...] to bolster the claim that grammatical cases in English are different from those in Ancient Greek or Latin.|$|R
25|$|Having {{brushed aside}} Ney, the Russians <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Bernadotte's corps. On 24 January, Markov mauled a French unit at Liebstadt (Miłakowo), {{capturing}} 300 Frenchmen. Bernadotte quickly assembled General of Division Pierre Dupont's division and General of Brigade Jacques Léonard Laplanche's dragoons at Preussisch Holland (Pasłęk) {{on his left}} flank in the northwest. On his own initiative, Bernadotte's chief of staff General of Brigade Nicolas Joseph Maison alerted the I Corps center and right flank. Maison directed General of Division Olivier Rivaud to concentrate his division at Osterode on the right, while General of Division Jean-Baptiste Drouet gathered his troops at Saalfeld (Zalewo) in the center. Maison held General of Brigade Michel Marie Pacthod's 8th Light Infantry Regiment at Mohrungen, while calling Sahuc's other dragoon brigade from the right flank toward the center.|$|E
25|$|On {{the stage}} to Geneva the frigid weather and several {{mechanical}} issues <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Alavoine. Thus it was not Lambot who attacked, but Heusghem (who had been second {{for the last two}} years). It appeared {{that this was going to}} be his shining Tour, however his bicycle broke on the ride to Metz. Heusghem made a prohibited bike change to stay in race for first. However, this defied the rules during this time, and he was docked one hour by race officials, dropping him to fourth overall. This is when Lambot noticed his change and took over in Dunkerque. Amidst all this Lambot took his second win of the Tour de France at the age of 36, becoming the first to win the Tour de France without winning a stage.|$|E
25|$|Forest's tactic {{was simply}} to run Fort Diamond into the {{privateer}} {{at a rate of}} about nine knots. As Fort Diamond <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> them, the schooner's crew fired a broadside and discharged some small arms before all 50 or 60 crewmen jumped overboard and swam ashore. (The shore battery, not entirely distracted, also fired on Fort Diamond.) The impact of Fort Diamond hitting the privateer broke the chain that anchored the privateer to shore; the boarding party then cut two cables to free her. Fort Diamonds casualties amounted to two men wounded. The privateer turned out to be the Mosambique, armed with ten 18-pounder carronades, though she was pierced for 14 cannon. She was from Guadeloupe, provisioned for a three-month cruise and was under the command of Citizen Vallentes.|$|E
60|$|McTavish and the others, who had by {{that time}} dismounted, and were {{standing}} at their horses' heads amused spectators of the scene, looked at this urchin in surprise, until they observed that he was endeavouring to escape from a stout young woman who {{did her best to}} catch him. She had nearly succeeded, when he suddenly doubled like a hare and <b>bore</b> straight <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the horsemen. Seeing this, the woman gave in, and, turning, fled to the town, while the little fellow ran and clasped the Highlander by the knees.|$|R
5000|$|After {{entering}} Cape Fear, Raleigh turned south {{but soon}} ran hard aground on a bar known as [...] "the Rip." [...] As the tide went out, the now unsupported {{weight of the}} ironclads armored casemate, cannon, and machinery <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> heavily <b>on</b> the aft section of her keel. Unable to sustain the added weight pressure, Raleigh [...] "broke her back," [...] {{resulting in a total}} loss of the new ironclad after serving just one week in the Confederate Navy. Salvage crews reclaimed her iron plating, both her Brooke rifles, both smoothbore cannon, and shipped her boilers to CSS Chattahoochee, then being repaired at Columbus, GA.|$|R
50|$|In the September 1966 election, the National Assembly was {{dominated}} by rightists with a minority of leftists, namely, Khieu Samphan, Hou Youn and Hu Nim, all of which played highly influential roles in leading the revolts to come. As the newly elected right-wing Government asserted its control over Cambodia’s provinces, it penetrated into the village level and {{was supported by the}} Prime Minister Lon Nol and the army, <b>boring</b> <b>down</b> heavily <b>on</b> many peasants and pushing the Left towards a defensive. Furthermore, Sihanouk’s wavering stance between the Right and Left appeared to be leaning towards the Rightists as he had imprisoned several Pracheachon party members and announced his non-endorsement for the September elections.|$|R
25|$|At this {{critical}} juncture, however, the Peloponnesian line {{began to fall}} into disorder as ships broke line to pursue individual Athenian vessels. Seeing this, Thrasybulus turned his ships abruptly and attacked the Spartan left. After routing these ships, the Athenian right <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the Peloponnesian center, and, catching them {{in a state of}} disorganization, quickly routed them as well. The Syracusans on the right, seeing the rest of their fleet in flight, abandoned their attack on the Athenian left and fled as well. The narrowness of the straits, which ensured that the Peloponnesians had only a short way to go to safety, limited the damage the Athenians could inflict, but by day's end they had captured 21 Spartan ships to the 15 of theirs that the Spartans had taken in the early fighting. The Athenians set up a trophy on Cynossema and put in at Sestos, while the Peloponnesians made their way back to Abydos.|$|E
25|$|Sailors {{on nearby}} ships heard {{the series of}} signals and, realizing that a {{collision}} was imminent, gathered to watch as Imo <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Mont-Blanc.

25|$|The advance {{along the}} coastal road {{was preceded by}} heavy {{artillery}} bombardment and airstrikes, but quickly became bogged down and was soon behind schedule. The narrowness of the road forced a slow advance, and Israeli armor became stuck in a large traffic jam. Several armored vehicles were knocked out by PLO fighters with anti-tank weaponry hiding in three groves along the road. One of the lead battalions, {{which was supposed to}} bypass Tyre and establish a blocking position {{to the north of the}} city, made a wrong turn and found itself in the center of the city, where it was ambushed. At eight in the evening the force finally crossed the Litani River and headed towards Sidon. In the central sector, the mission went as planned. The two Israeli divisions bypassed Beaufort Castle on both sides. Although an order to postpone the capture of Beaufort Castle was issued, it did not reach Israeli forces in time to prevent the operation, and Israeli troops of the Golani Brigade captured the castle in the fiercely-fought Battle of the Beaufort. The road junction at Nabatieh was also secured by the end of the first day. Meanwhile, the easternmost force penetrated into the Bekaa Valley and <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the Syrian positions. One division bypassed Mount Hermon via a road bulldozed by Israeli military engineers and cleared the town of Hasbaiya before swinging right and advancing towards Rachaiya. Though Israeli forces halted in the floor of the valley, they were flanking Syrian forces from the east and west. The Syrians put up minimal resistance and conducted some harassing artillery fire. By the end of the first day, the operation had gone almost entirely according to plan, though the advance along the coastal road was behind schedule.|$|E
60|$|The anchor was fixed, {{and the men}} {{strained}} at the capstan with a will, but, notwithstanding their utmost efforts, {{they could}} not penetrate the shore ice. Meanwhile the wind increased, and snow began to fall in large flakes. The tide, too, as it receded, brought a stream of ice round the point ahead of them, which <b>bore</b> right <b>down</b> <b>on</b> their bows. At first the concussions were slight, and {{the bow of the}} ship turned the floes aside, but heavier masses soon came down, and at last one fixed itself on the cable, and caused the anchor to drag with a harsh, grating sound.|$|R
50|$|Wang Yanzheng (王延政) (died 951?), {{known as}} Tiande Emperor (天德帝) after his era name of Tiande, {{formally}} Prince Gongyi of Fu (福恭懿王), also known during Min as the Prince of Fusha (富沙王), {{was the last}} ruler of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Min. In 943, he, then in civil war with his brother Wang Yanxi (Emperor Jingzong), declared himself emperor of a new state of Yin at his base Jian Prefecture (建州, in modern Nanping, Fujian), but after Wang Yanxi was killed by the general Zhu Wenjin, who was himself assassinated thereafter, Wang Yanzheng reclaimed the title of Emperor of Min. His reign would last {{less than three years}} overall, though, as Min's northwestern neighbor Southern Tang <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> militarily <b>on</b> him and forced his surrender, ending Min.|$|R
60|$|Happily this {{stirring}} {{incident was}} not altogether unwitnessed. Far {{up the valley}} it was observed by four living creatures, three of whom immediately came tearing down the road at racing speed. Gradually their different powers separated them from each other. Archie came first, Eddie next, and Junkie brought up the rear. On nearing the field the first wrenched a stake out of a fence; the second caught up a rake, {{that had been left}} by the haymakers; and the last, unscrewing the butt of his rod, broke the line, and flourished the weapon as a cudgel. They all three leaped into the field one after another, and <b>bore</b> courageously <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the bull, being well accustomed to deal with animals of the sort.|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to the Greater Asia Association, Matsui also served throughout the war as President of the Association for the National Defense Concept, a virulently anti-Western and anti-Semitic organization founded in February 1942 to support the Japanese war effort. In 1945 as the Allies <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the Philippines Matsui declared over the radio that Japan would never withdraw from the Philippines [...] "even though Tokyo should be reduced to ashes." [...] Soon after he also stated his plans to speak at a lecture meeting on August 20 opposing any surrender. Nevertheless, on August 15, 1945, {{at his home in}} Atami Matsui heard Emperor Hirohito announce that Japan had surrendered unconditionally to the Allies.|$|E
500|$|Emeralds first lieutenant, Thomas Forest, {{commanded}} the 6-gun cutter [...] on 13 March 1804 when, with 30 of Emeralds crew aboard, she captured a French privateer off Saint-Pierre, Martinique. Contrary winds prevented the privateer, Mosambique, from entering St Pierre {{and she had}} sought shelter beneath the batteries at Seron. Because Emerald was too far downwind, Captain O'Bryen used boats and crew from Emerald to create a diversion and draw fire from the battery while Fort Diamond approached from the opposite direction, rounded Pearl Rock (some two miles off the coast), and <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Mosambique. Forest put the cutter alongside {{with such force that}} a chain securing the privateer to the shore snapped. The 60-man French crew abandoned their vessel and swam ashore. The Royal Navy took [...] into service.|$|E
500|$|Yorktown, {{a part of}} the United States' response, {{departed}} Charlotte Amalie for Valparaíso on 17 October for a six-week, storm-tossed voyage {{around the}} South American continent via the Straits of Magellan. Less than two weeks after Yorktowns 30 November arrival, Baltimore departed, leaving American interests in the hands of Evans and Yorktown. Over the ensuing weeks, Chile and the United States came close to war, but cooler heads prevailed. Locally, Evans' patience was [...] "dangerously tested", but it held. One inflammatory incident occurred when Chilean torpedo boats <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Evans' ship, turning their helms hard over at the last possible instant to avoid a collision. On another occasion, a group of locals threw rocks at Evans and his gig as it lay {{at the foot of a}} jetty.|$|E
500|$|Joss was {{concerned}} about supporting his family after his baseball career ended; many players of the day had little education and few marketable job skills beyond their abilities on the diamond. As sportswriter Franklin Lewis wrote, [...] "Only a handful of players in the rough, stirring, {{early days of the}} major leagues arrived from campuses. And when they did, sometimes the shock was too great for them. Some grizzled holdovers from the 1890s were around and they <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> heavily <b>on</b> the eardrums of the so-called college-boy set." [...] Joss was hired as a sports columnist after the 1906 season for the Toledo News-Bee. He also served as their Sunday sports editor. His writings proved so popular that sales of the paper increased and a special phone line was installed in his office to field the large volume of calls he received from fans. The increased popularity gave him an advantage when negotiating with the Naps before the 1907 season, and the club agreed to pay him $4,000 ($). (By 1910, player salaries averaged only $2,500.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Leaping up, Watty {{seized the}} oar, waved his flag frantically, and yelled out his alarm. Still the ship <b>bore</b> majestically <b>down</b> <b>on</b> him, her huge bow bulking larger and higher as she drew near. Again Watty yelled, loud and long, and waved his flag furiously. The ship was close upon him--seemed almost towering over him. He saw a sailor appear lazily at the bow {{with his hands}} in his pockets. He saw the eyes of that seaman {{suddenly}} display their whites, and his hands, with the ten fingers extended, fly upwards. He heard a tremendous [...] "Starboard ha-a-a-rd!" [...] followed by a terrific [...] "Starboard it is!" [...] Then there was a crashing of rotten wood, a fearful rushing of water in his ears, a bursting desire to breathe, and a dreadful thrusting downwards into a dark abyss. Even in that moment of extremity the text of the morning flashed through his whirling brain--then all was still.|$|R
5000|$|Vörg was {{attempting}} the Eiger with Anderl Heckmair. They had {{set off in}} pursuit of the preceding team in a race to the top. When they caught up with the Austrian team of Heinrich Harrer and Fritz Kasparek (Vörg and Heckmair's superior 12-point crampons were more useful on the Eiger; Harrer didn't have any crampons at all) they decided to proceed as a four. When they reached the 'Spider' icefield high on the face, they were hit by a ferocious storm, avalanches pounding down upon them. Andreas Heckmair describes what happened when he slipped from the face. [...] I <b>bore</b> straight <b>down</b> <b>on</b> him in a lightning swift slide. Wiggerl let the rope drop and caught me with his hands, and one of the points of my crampons went through his palm. The force with which I came <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Wiggerl knocked him out of his holds, but he, too, had been able to save himself and there we were, standing about 4 feet below our stance on steep ice without any footholds.Our Friends...hadn't even noticed anything had happened. If we hadn't checked our fall we would have hurled them out from the face with us in a wide arc.|$|R
