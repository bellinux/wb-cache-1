40|$|Background: Ischemic hypoxic {{brain injury}} often causes {{irreversible}} brain damage. The lack of effective and widely applicable pharmacological treatments for ischemic stroke patients may explain a {{growing interest in}} traditional medicines. <b>beta-Asarone,</b> which has significant pharmacological effects on {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), was used in the prevention of cerebral ischemia in this paper. Methods: The right middle cerebral artery occlusion model was used in the study. The effects of <b>beta-Asarone</b> on mortality rate, neurobehavior, grip strength, lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione content, Lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase activity, glutathione reductase activity, catalase activity, Na+- K+-ATPase activity and glutathione S transferase activity in a rat model were studied respectively. Results: <b>beta-Asarone</b> significantly improved the neurological outcome after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in terms of neurobehavioral function in rats. Meanwhile, supplementation of <b>beta-Asarone</b> significantly boosted the defense mechanism against cerebral ischemia via increasing antioxidants activity related to lesion pathogenesis. Restoration of the antioxidant homeostasis in the brain after reperfusion may help the brain recover from ischemic injury. Conclusions: These experimental results suggest that complement <b>beta-Asarone</b> is protective against cerebral ischemia in specific way. The administration of <b>beta-Asarone</b> could reduce focal cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury. The Mechanism of <b>beta-Asarone</b> in protection of cerebral ischemia was via increasing antioxidants activity related to lesion pathogenesis...|$|E

30|$|Nature {{offers an}} {{incredible}} diversity of chemical compounds {{with a wide}} array of physiological effects. Natural substances are not only used in personal care products, but some are used in food, as spices, or in medicine (Table  3) [2 - 4, 14]. The borderline between these uses is not sharp. Many herbal substances used as phytopharmaceuticals have hazardous properties [4], and many ingredients in natural flavorings have toxic properties (like <b>beta-asarone,</b> coumarin, hydrogen cyanide, methyl eugenol, capsaicin, eucalyptol, hypericin, thujone, aloin/aloe-emodin, berberine, and pyrrolizidine alkaloids [2]). Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} many natural substances used in personal care products are naturally toxic, too, and demand a prudent handling and sensible regulations.|$|E
40|$|A {{shifting}} demographic {{of people}} admix cannabis with cholinergic agents, intent upon enhancing cannabimimetic effects or reducing adverse effects. Augmentation of cannabimimetic effects with tobacco (or nicotine) has been corroborated by in vitro mechanistic studies, animal behaviour studies, anecdotes from patients, and one clinical trial.

The grey literature also reports admixtures of cannabis and calamus root, {{with the intent of}} reducing adverse effects of cannabis. At least one compound in calamus root (<b>beta-asarone)</b> blocks acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Contrary to expectations, AChE blockade diminishes cannabimimetic effects.

40|$|Sweet-flag (Acorus calamus L., Araceae) is an {{aromatic}} perennial herb. Its dried roots {{have long}} been used in medicinal preparations and for the flavouring of bitter liqueurs and appetizers. Due to the habitat loss of Acorus its populations have become rare in several European countries. The focus now is on the conservation of its genetic resources and to start its field cultivation to meet the raw material demand. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the chemical and morphological characters of Acorus calamus collected from the nature in Finland - before deposit to the Nordic Gene Bank - and to compare them to the Acorus accessions collected in the Czech Gene Bank. The Finnish accessions have been collected during 2002 in South-West Finland at seven natural populations. One accession was obtained from Slovenia (Zalec) and their cuttings were transplanted into the field (moisture sandy till, pH 6. 8) of Agrifood Research Finland, Mikkeli. The collection of Czech sweet-flags has been found in 1998 and it consists from 27 accessories originated from all country. The cuttings were replanted into the growing containers to Gene Bank in Olomouc, where a special basin was built to keep them in optimal wet conditions and to protect sprouting of rhizomes and mixing. Leave and rhizome morphological characters, essential oil content and composition of the dried rhizome were determined (Czech accessions during 1997 2000, Finnish accessions during 2004). The average oil content of the Finnish and Slovenian accessions was 1. 47 % (1. 15 - 1. 87 %) and the oil composition was quite similar. Their main compounds were solavetivon (x = 11. 07 %) and beta asarone (10. 08 %). The Czech accessions had a similar essential oil content and composition as the Finnish and Slovenian origin ones. The average essential oil content of 1. 91 % (1. 20 % 2. 92 %) is slightly higher than in Finland, but anyway 14 from 24 analysed samples did not execute the norm defined for quality of Radix calami (minimum 2 % of essential oil) by Czech Pharmaceutical Codex. The main components of the essential oils were beta- and gamma- asarones. The average content of gamma-asarone was 18. 65 % (12. 52 25. 35 %) and that of the <b>beta-asarone</b> was 16. 11 % (11. 34 21. 30 %). The content of the <b>beta-asarone</b> in sweet-flag drug did not exceed the maximal recommended value 0. 5 % of dry matter content. The Finnish, Slovenian and Czech origin sweet-flags in both Finnish and Czech collections seemed to be phenotypically and chemically very similar to each other. They all represent the European triploid type of Acorus calamus var. calamus. The average essential oil content (1. 47 % in Finland and 1. 91 % in the Czech Republic) is not sufficient according to the Czech norm for Radix calami quality, but the content of carcinogen <b>beta-asarone</b> did not exceeded secure limit 0. 5 % of dry drug mass. vo...|$|E
40|$|Quantum {{mechanical}} calculations at the semiempirical level (AM 1 method) {{were conducted}} for estragole (1), methyleugenol (2), safrole (3), alpha-asarone (4), <b>beta-asarone</b> (5), elemicin (6), allylbenzene (7), eugenol (8), trans-anethole (9), isosafrole (10), and myristicin (11), {{and the results}} compared with the known genotoxicity of 1 - 6 {{and the absence of}} genotoxicity of 7 - 11 (unscheduled DNA synthesis assay). The various compounds showed no significant differences in the relative stability of the radical species formed as intermediates in C-sp 3 hydroxylation (delta HR(radical)) and in the corresponding enthalpy of activation (delta H++). In contrast, the carbonium ions of the genotoxic congeners 1 - 6 were shown to be comparatively more stable than those of the inactive compounds 7 - 11, with the exception of eugenol (8). The inactivity of this compound could be due to a very rapid stabilization of the carbonium ion by deprotonation to form a quinone methide, as suggested by quantum chemical calculations. The relative stability of the carbonium ion thus appears {{to be one of the}} key factors in the genotoxicity of allylbenzenes and propenylbenzenes...|$|E
40|$|Volatile {{concentrates}} {{from the}} oleo-gum resin of Commiphora myrrha (Nees) Engl. {{and from the}} rhizomes of Acorus calamus were isolated by supercritical extraction with carbon dioxide. The volatile oil of myrrh was obtained at 9. 0 MPa and 50 degrees C and at a CO(2) flow Of 1. 5 kg/h. Acorus calamus was extracted at 9. 0 MPa and 45 degrees C and at a CO(2) flow Of 1. 6 kg/h. In both cases, an oil devoid of cuticular waxes was obtained with a single depressurization stage. The SFE myrrh oil had a yield, Y, of 3. 2 %. Its main components, identified and quantified by GC/MS, were furanoeudesma- 1, 3 -diene, 34. 9 %; lindestrene, 12. 9 %; curzerene, 8. 5 %; and germacrone, 5. 8 %. The essential oils from the same starting material by hydrodistillation, HD, (Y = 2. 8 %) and by steam distillation, SD, (Y = 0. 4 %) were quite similar to the SFE extract. The main components of the SFE oil of A. calamus (Y = 3. 5 %) were acorenone, 13. 4 %; iso-acorone, 11. 6 %; (Z) -sesquilavandulol, 11. 0 %; dehydroxy isocalamendiol, 7. 7 %; and <b>beta-asarone,</b> 5. 5 %.

40|$|Black pepper (Piper nigrum L) is an {{important}} commodity of Indonesia, which has been cultivated since the 6 th century. The plant plays {{an important}} role in local economies since 95 % of the plantations are cultivated by smallholder farmers. Because of this important economic value, proper plant production is highly valued. One of the central factors to maintain plant production is how to control key pests of the plant such as the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, the stem borer, Lophobaris piperis, the tinged bug, Dasynus piperis, and the bug, Diconocoris hewetti (Chapter 1). Currently, farmers habitually use synthetic pesticides to control these pests. However, this habit poses not only a serious health risk to local workers and the people living near the treated areas, but also threatens non-target species (Chapter 2). Therefore, it has become an important issue to find relatively easy alternative control strategies, which are comparable effective as the synthetic pesticides, but safer to the farmers, consumers, and the environment and available at low price. One of the possible alternatives would be the use of botanical pesticides. Indonesia seems to be in a good position to develop and utilize this pesticide since the country has a rich biodiversity of plant species. Nowadays, the increased consumer request in developed countries for organic products stimulates the interest in the use of botanical pesticides. Chapter 3 describes the nematicidal activity of 17 plant extracts against the root-knot nematode, M. incognita. Results demonstrate that shapes of the dead nematodes in laboratory experiments can clearly be distinguished differed in a characteristic way, and groups of pesticides and plant extracts. This phenomenon may be an indicator for the modes of action of the tested pesticides. The green house experiment indicates that raw material of clove bud is comparable effective as the recommended synthetic pesticide. Chapter 4 describes contact toxicity, oral toxicity and repellency of 17 plant extracts against the model insect species Tribolium castaneum. This study shows that the most promising candidates for consideration as botanical pesticides are extracts of pyrethrum, sweet flag, tobacco, clove, lemongrass, neem, vetiver, graviola, citrosa and black pepper. Formulation of three of 10 most potent extracts was developed and tested in the laboratory followed by field experiments. Laboratory experiments indicate that extracts from pyrethrum, sweet flag and clove show the highest toxicity and/or repellent effect toward L. piperis. Field experiments reveal that the formulation is able to control most pest species of the pepper plants in the meantime being less toxic towards the 11 monitored species of natural enemies for known pest organisms such as caterpillars, aphids, moths, beetles than that of the recommended synthetic pesticide, deltamethrin. Furthermore, the field experiments reveal that within 9 hours after application the treated plants are recolonized again by ants and spiders, indicating a short degradation period of the formulation. Altogether it is concluded that the newly defined botanical formulation provides an effective and environmentally friendly alternative for controlling several pests of black pepper (Chapter 5). The safety of five botanical pesticides i. e. pyrethrum, clove, sweet flag, and derris is evaluated for human oral exposure via consumption of treated products. Based on literature data from human and animal studies safe levels for daily oral exposure to the various botanical preparations and/or their active ingredients were derived and these outcomes were compared to the estimated maximal daily intake of residues of the botanical pesticides expected to be present on pepper berries treated with these preparations as pesticides. Results indicate that use of extracts of sweet flag containing <b>beta-asarone</b> would result in a MoE that would not indicate a high priority for risk management. However, because for <b>beta-asarone</b> restrictions in applications as food additive are indicated and since use as a pesticide implies an avoidable risk, it is concluded that the application of this botanical pesticide should not be encouraged. The use and use levels of the other three botanical pesticides evaluated are not of safety concern (Chapter 6). Finally, in chapter 7, the implications of the presented work are discussed, with emphasis on the potency, suitability and the safety of the botanical pesticides when used against pests associated with pepper plants. Overall, the results obtained confirm the hypothesis that botanical pesticides have the potency to be used to control pests of black pepper, providing a promising alternative for synthetic pesticide use, especially because they pose lower risks for the local environment...|$|E
