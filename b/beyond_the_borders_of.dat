From the 1860s until the 1890s, Feilberg participated in expeditions to Sumatra, Singapore, and Penang. In 1867, he exhibited photos at an exhibition in Paris and in 1870 he joined {{an expedition to}} the Batak lands of East Sumatra, where he successfully recorded scores of ethnographic images.|$|E

5|$|Operation Yoav {{had left}} Faluja as an enclave within Israeli-held {{territory}} and during November 1948 the Hammers routinely returned to bomb {{what became known}} as the Faluja Pocket. The town would nonetheless hold out until the end of the war. On December 22 Israel launched Operation Horev, its last major offensive of the war, to finally defeat the Egyptian expeditionary force and expel it <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>borders</b> <b>of</b> Mandatory Palestine. 69 Squadron once again flew in support of Israeli efforts in the south, targeting the air base at El-Arish, Khan Younis, Gaza and Rafah. The squadron also revisited Faluja to prevent an Egyptian sortie from the beleaguered pocket, and on New Year's Day 1949 flew a failed attempt to bomb an Egyptian Navy flotilla which had shelled Tel Aviv. 69 Squadron flew its last missions of the war in the early morning of January 7, 1949, against Rafah. Having evaded Egyptian flak on most occasions, both participating bombers were hit, rendering one unserviceable.|$|E

5|$|Political forces <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>borders</b> <b>of</b> Egypt {{exacerbated}} the internal {{problems of the}} Ptolemaic kingdom. AntiochusIII the Great and PhilipV of Macedon had made a pact to divide Egypt's overseas possessions. Philip had seized several islands and cities in Caria and Thrace, while the Battle of Panium (198 BC) had resulted in the transfer of Coele-Syria, including Judaea, from the Ptolemies to the Seleucids. Meanwhile, {{in the south of}} Egypt, there was a long-standing revolt that had begun during the reign of PtolemyIV, led by Horwennefer and by his successor Ankhwennefer. Both the war and the internal revolt were still ongoing when the young PtolemyV was officially crowned at Memphis at the age of 12 (seven years after the start of his reign), and the Memphis decree issued.|$|E
5|$|Rosas faced many {{threats to}} his power {{during the late}} 1830s and early 1840s. He fought a war against the Peru–Bolivian Confederation, endured a {{blockade}} by France, faced a revolt in his own province and battled a major rebellion that lasted for years and spread to several Argentine provinces. Rosas persevered and extended his influence in the provinces, exercising effective control over them through direct and indirect means. By 1848, he had extended his power <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>borders</b> <b>of</b> Buenos Aires and was ruler of all of Argentina. Rosas also attempted to annex the neighbouring nations of Uruguay and Paraguay. France and Great Britain jointly retaliated against Argentine expansionism, blockading Buenos Aires {{for most of the}} late 1840s, but were unable to halt Rosas, whose prestige was greatly enhanced by his string of successes.|$|E
5|$|One {{of several}} ecclesiastical sources that deal {{specifically}} with Ragnall is an undated grant to the Cluniac priory at Paisley. Since this grant probably {{dates to the}} period after Ragnall's defeat to Áengus, it may be evidence of an attempt made by Ragnall to secure an alliance with Alan fitz Walter, Steward of Scotland (died 1204). The patrons of this priory were members of Alan's own family, a powerful kindred that had recently begun to expand its influence westwards from Renfrew, to the frontier of the Scottish realm and the fringes of Argyll. Since Bute seems to have fallen {{into the hands of}} this kindred at about the time of Ragnall's grant, it is possible that Alan took advantage of the internal conflict between the meic Somairle, and seized the island before 1200. Alternately, Alan may have received the island from Ragnall as payment for military support against Áengus, who appears to have gained the upper hand over Ragnall by 1192. Alan's expansion and influence in territories outwith the bounds of the Scottish kingdom may have been perceived as a threat by William I, King of Scots (died 1214), and may partly explain the king's construction of a royal castle at Ayr in 1195. This fortress extended Scottish royal authority into the outer Firth of Clyde region, and was probably intended to dominate not only William's peripheral barons, but also independent rulers just <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>borders</b> <b>of</b> the Scottish realm. In fact, Alan's westward expansion appears to have suddenly ceased at about 1200, and may have been a consequence of royal anxiety concerning an alliance with Ragnall.|$|E
