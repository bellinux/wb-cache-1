25|$|The {{trenches}} were hot, dusty, and miserable, but {{conditions were}} worse between the lines, {{where thousands of}} wounded Federal soldiers suffered horribly without food, water, or medical assistance. Grant was reluctant {{to ask for a}} formal truce that would allow him to recover his wounded <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an acknowledgment he had lost the battle. He and Lee traded notes across the lines from June 5 to 7 without coming to an agreement, and when Grant formally requested a two-hour cessation of hostilities, {{it was too late for}} most of the unfortunate wounded, who were now bloated corpses. Grant was widely criticized in the Northern press for this lapse of judgment.|$|E
500|$|An {{interview}} with Shearsmith and Pemberton was published on British comedy website Chortle.co.uk after Inside No. 9 won the Chortle Award for best TV show. The pair {{were asked if}} they would ever consider writing an episode with a happy ending. Shearsmith responded by saying [...] "Yes, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the biggest surprise of all ... But last year we had the Last Gasp, and that had quite a happy ending - and people hated that one!" [...] Similarly, Pemberton suggested that [...] "people are disappointed if we don't deliver something horrible".|$|E
500|$|The {{interaction}} between Reynolds and Bullock was well received by critics. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly opined that the chemistry {{between the two}} actors was [...] "fresh and irresistible." [...] Zorianna Kit of The Huffington Post exclaimed that [...] "what [...] audiences of this lite-fare comedy in their seats is the undeniable on-screen chemistry between leads Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds." [...] She continued: [...] "The two are so adept at comedy and have so much fun with one another, viewers watching The Proposal won't be able to resist their charms, even {{when some of the}} plot veers in to unnecessarily silliness." [...] Betsey Sharkley of the Los Angeles Times felt that their relationship was a [...] "cheeky update of The Taming of the Shrew." [...] She opined, [...] "Bullock's deft physical comedy, one of her most endearing qualities, is given a full run. [...] Reynolds' ability to deliver a line, or a look, with withering, surgical precision is there at every turn." [...] Giving it a one out of five stars, The Guardian writer Peter Bradshaw gave a negative reaction to the {{interaction between}} Reynolds and Bullock. Bradshaw stated: [...] "Their initial sparky detestation isn't convincing, and neither is their later thawing and romance. In each scene, it looks as if they have never met before. And Margaret isn't permitted to be a convincing cow, because that would make her unsympathetic [...] Andrew can't be a total wimp, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unsexy, so the fundamental comic premises of the film are fudged." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{creditor}} unofficially informs a debtor {{that the}} creditor forgives the debt between them. Even if such forgiveness is not formally documented, the creditor may be estopped from changing its mind and seeking {{to collect the}} debt, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> change <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unfair.|$|R
50|$|Where a {{party is}} {{denied the right}} to {{introduce}} evidence <b>because</b> <b>that</b> evidence <b>would</b> <b>be</b> inflammatory, hearsay, or would lack sufficient authentication, that party must make a proffer of what the evidence would have shown in order to preserve the issue for appeal.|$|R

500|$|Like Robin, the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{video is}} drawn in a simplistic style that emphasises bold colours and clear, strong lines. It {{features}} Robin {{and his friend}} Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, two kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching {{a man with a}} head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said [...] "If you freeze-frame it on the video, the guy with the five strands of hair slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." [...] Colin Greenwood said [...] "there was no way that we could appear in it to perform in it <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> so Spinal Tap" [...] and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be [...] "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it [...] "is really about the violence around , which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there. That's why it works. And that's why it does my head in every time I see it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under UK law, a {{contractor}} {{can be found}} caught by the tax initiative IR35, {{that is to say}} there is a virtual ("deemed") employment <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the case had the contract between worker and hirer been direct and the worker is then subject to extra taxes to compensate the government in that regard, yet he still has no apparent employment entitlements.

His {{proposal}} was this, that he should go as master of the ship, and about twenty men, such as we could best trust, and attempt to trade privately, upon the coast of Brazil, with the planters, not at the principal ports, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> admitted.|$|R
50|$|As a teenager, Lee {{realized}} he was attracted to the same sex, {{but he did not}} identify himself as gay <b>because</b> he believed <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a sin. Instead, he spent years fighting his attractions, praying for God to change them.|$|R
2500|$|Reading [...] the 16th century Italian Rabbi Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno {{distinguished}} what Abraham's servant {{did from}} divination. According to Sforno, Abraham's servant {{did not make}} what he said a sign whereby he might recognize Isaac's destined wife, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> divination; rather he prayed that it might occur {{the way that he}} described.

2500|$|Barrett {{has become}} a [...] "lightning rod" [...] for {{controversy}} {{as a result of}} his criticisms of alternative medicine theories and practitioners. Barrett says he does not criticize conventional medicine <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> [...] "way outside [...] scope." [...] He states he does not give equal time to some subjects, and has written on his web site that [...] "Quackery and fraud don't involve legitimate controversy and are not balanced subjects. I don't believe it is helpful to publish 'balanced' articles about unbalanced subjects." [...] Barrett is at the forefront of exposing questionable aspects of chiropractic.|$|E
2500|$|Gandin brought Barge's {{ultimatum}} to {{his senior}} {{officers and the}} seven chaplains of the Acqui for discussion. Six of the chaplains {{and all of his}} senior officers advised him to comply with the German demands while one of the chaplains suggested immediate surrender. However, Gandin could not agree to join the Germans <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> against the King's orders as relayed by Badoglio. He also did not want to fight them because, as he said, [...] "they had fought with us and for us, side by side". On the other hand, surrendering the weapons would violate the spirit of the armistice. Despite the orders from the Italian GHQ, Gandin chose to continue negotiating with Barge.|$|E
50|$|Stalag fiction was a {{short-lived}} genre of Nazi exploitation Holocaust pornography that {{flourished in the}} 1950s and early 1960s, and stopped after {{the time of the}} Eichmann Trial, because of a ban by the Israeli government. These books did not include Jews, apparently <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> even more taboo. They are no longer available for a reading today in terms of traditional publication, although the advent of the Internet has allowed for peer-to-peer file sharing.|$|R

60|$|However, there's a compensation; for {{in those}} two days I reached and passed--successfully--a point which I was solicitous about before I ever began the book: viz., the battle of Patay. <b>Because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{naturally}} <b>be</b> the next to the last chapter of a work consisting of either two books or one.

2500|$|In Beauvoir's view, abortions {{performed}} legally {{by doctors}} {{would have little}} risk to the mother. She argues that the Catholic Church cannot make {{the claim that the}} souls of the unborn would not end up in heaven because of their lack of baptism <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> contradictory to other Church teachings. She writes that the issue of abortion is not an issue of morality but of [...] "masculine sadism" [...] toward woman. Beauvoir describes pregnancy, which is viewed as both a gift and a curse to woman. In this new creation of a new life the woman loses her self, seeing herself as [...] "no longer anything... a passive instrument". Beauvoir writes that, [...] "maternal sadomasochism creates guilt feelings for the daughter that will express themselves in sadomasochistic behavior toward her own children, without end", and makes an appeal for socialist child rearing practices.|$|E
2500|$|Grant and Meade {{launched}} no {{more attacks}} on the Confederate defenses at Cold Harbor. Although Grant wired Washington that he had [...] "gained no decisive advantage" [...] and that his [...] "losses were not severe," [...] {{he wrote in his}} Personal Memoirs that he regretted {{for the rest of his}} life the decision to send in his men. The two opposing armies faced each other for nine days of trench warfare, in some places only yards apart. The trenches were hot, dusty, and miserable, but conditions were worse between the lines, where thousands of wounded Federal soldiers suffered horribly without food, water, or medical assistance. Grant was reluctant to ask for a formal truce that would allow him to recover his wounded <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an acknowledgment he had lost the battle.

2500|$|Following an April 2008 set visit, Meyer {{opined that}} Pattinson and Stewart had {{developed}} chemistry so good it [...] "may cause hyperventilation". Pattinson revealed that Meyer {{had given him}} an early copy of Midnight Sun—a re-telling {{of the events of}} Twilight, narrated from Edward's point of view. He explained that: [...] "That is what I liked about [...] the job, because the guy doesn’t really exist that much, so you can just create whatever you want. Then, when I found out there was another book from Edward’s perspective, [...] we had the same perspective!" [...] In preparation for the role, Pattinson wrote journal entries as Edward and distanced from his friends and family, explaining that he [...] "wanted to feel his isolation". Physically, he revealed that; [...] "I was supposed to get a six-pack. But it didn't really work out." [...] One scene in the story sees Edward, a gifted pianist, compose a lullaby for Bella. Pattinson was given the opportunity to submit a composition for consideration for this scene, with Hardwicke stating; [...] "I told him he should write one, and let’s see if we can make it work, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> really cool if it was Rob’s song. He’s a beautiful musician, a very creative soul, very similar to Edward. He just totally reads the most interesting stuff, and sees the most interesting movies, and is very introspective and diving into his existential self." [...] Meyer approved; [...] "If Robert could write a lullaby, that would definitely add to some of the mystique of the movie, wouldn’t it?" [...] While two of Pattinson's compositions do feature in the final film, the lullaby piece finally selected was composed by Carter Burwell.|$|E

Little Jean was named for his real life daughter who would always dance when he played guitar. When he played it for his ex-wife for the first time, Little Jean danced, but his ex-wife's response was not what he had hoped for. She told him he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to afford child support now, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> song <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a hit.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} some {{disagreement}} about {{the consistency of the}} own-race bias. However, data gathered from multiple studies does show that the own-race bias is consistent. The own-race bias occurs in people of all races. Since eyewitness identification can be problematic, researches have started to conduct studies of own-race biases using more forensics. This kind of research needs {{to pay more attention to}} a target's distinctive features and level of attractiveness. If a target is very distinctive or very attractive, it could reduce the cross-race effect <b>because</b> <b>that</b> person <b>would</b> <b>be</b> easier to identify.|$|R
40|$|Anselm {{says some}} {{seemingly}} harsh things about forgiveness, for example, that God cannot simply forgive the wrong {{done at the}} Fall. I argue that the harshness is only apparent. God cannot simply forgive sin <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> best for mankind. Divine forgiveness must be understood {{in light of the}} importance Anselm places on human freedom and the virtue of patience. I look at divine forgiveness in Cur Deus Homo and the first sin in De casu diaboli to explain Anselm's view on why God prefers process to immediate change, in hopes of bringing some new, Anselmian, insight to an old theme...|$|R
