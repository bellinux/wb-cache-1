In July 2005, a large Pinus pinaster Ait. forest, located in Guadalajara (central Spain), burned down. In this area, we studied fire-related fitness traits in natural stands (zone N) and compared them to those of trees sown with seeds from foreign sources (zone S). Cone production per hectare in zone N doubled that found in zone S. In addition, zone N resulted in more saplings per hectare as well as more small trees <b>bearing</b> <b>cones</b> than zone S. In zone S, trees showed thicker crowns and less fructification resulting in open formations with low intraspecific competition. Whereas in the natural stands the average percentage of serotiny per tree was 32 %, in the sown stands only one serotinous cone was found in seven unburned harvested trees. Compared with zone S, the presence of seedlings after springtime was almost nine times higher in zone N in spite of the damaging effects of logging and removal of burnt wood...|$|R

40|$|Case {{carburized}} <b>bearing</b> <b>cones</b> {{were subjected}} to impact loadings using an experimental impact drop tester. The cones were manufactured from AISI-SAE 4320 steel by hot ring rolling, or machining from seamless tube. The microstructure consisted of retained austenite and tempered martensite. Some samples also contained fine dispersed carbides. ^ The cones were impacted with energies {{in the range from}} 3 to 30 J. The acceleration of the impacter was measured in-situ. Post impact analysis included indentation surface profiling and cross section sampling for hardness, retained austenite and crack morphology. ^ In general, results indicated that material response to impact loading was dominated by core thickness, microstructural constituents, and service history. ^ Impacts on lubricated contact surfaces were more elastic, thereby limiting deformation. The critical or transition impact energy which caused case fracture was determined. The mode of case fracture depended on the retained austenite profile and load history: (1) Increased retained austenite levels beyond 40 %, greatly reduced case fracture. (2) Increased load cycles moved the transition zone to lower impact energies. With increasing core thickness, the microstructure absorbed more energy. For high energy impacts which caused case fracture, the dependency on core thickness was enhanced. ^ Resulting impact damage depended on the amount and condition of retained austenite. As the retained austenite content increased, more energy was absorbed through work hardening and transformation to martensite. This reduced the depth of the damaged microstructure, as well as the indentation size. Instantaneous case fracture was prevented and cracking of the case structure was largely reduced. During service life, the microstructure continually lost the capability to respond elastically to impact loading. As a result, the absorbed energy increased, damage appeared deeper below the surface and the transition zone beyond which case fracture occurred, moved to lower impact energies. ^ The presence of carbides in the microstructure was beneficial only for very low impact loads, which limited deformation. As load increased, the carbides acted as stress concentration sites, which promoted crack initiation. The mode of deformation changed from displacement and transformation of retained austenite to a combination of displacement and case fracture, which absorbed minimum energy. As a result, the impact damage was far more severe, and extended deeper into the material. ...|$|R

Paraticinella eubejaouaensis evolved from Hedbergella trocoidea in the upper Aptian. The evolutionary trend is exemplified by the increasing number of chambers, by flattening of the spire height, by widening of the umbilicus with the appearance of a cover-plate, by acquisition of well-developed ridges on wall surfaces, and by the appearance of weakly developed infralaminal accessory apertures in later specimens of P. eubejaouaensis. A close study of the holotype of Ticinella bejaouaensis Sigal, 1966 reveals a substantial similarity in morphology and wall structure with Ticinella roberti and a lack of distinguishing criteria between the two species. Consequently, the species Ticinella bejaouaensis is invalidated and {{is considered to be a}} junior synonym of T. roberti. A third species was observed associated with Ticinella roberti and Biticinella breggiensis in Madagascar and Spain, and it is attributable to the genus Ticinella based on the presence of true umbilical supplementary apertures and a typical Ticinella wall structure (muricate to coarsely pustulose), while in gross morphology, it resembles Paraticinella eubejaouaensis. We have named this new taxon Ticinella moulladei. It differs from T. roberti by its thinner test, more numerous chambers, and wider umbilicus.

ContextReforestation programs to assist natural regeneration of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) forests after wildfires very often neglect the fire-adaptive traits of the selected seed-source populations, threatening future stand resilience to fire. AimWe investigate the influence of seed provenance and weight on the rate and timing of {{seed germination}}, and on early seedling growth of P. pinaster after fire. MethodsWe simulated conditions during fire by experimentally submitting free seeds from three P. pinaster provenances with contrasting levels of serotiny (from 58  % of trees <b>bearing</b> serotinous <b>cones</b> within the population) to six combinations of temperature and exposure time. We fitted GLMs and LMs to test for differences among provenances in reproductive performance after the thermal shock treatments. ResultsHeavy seeds derived from the very low serotinous population exhibited greater tolerance to heat (higher germination rate, lower germination time, and higher seedling length) than the lighter ones from the highly serotinous population. ConclusionThe seeds enclosed in serotinous cones are, however, the only ones protected from high fire-induced temperatures, delaying release until favourable post-burn conditions for germination and seedling establishment. Therefore, selecting the best fire-adapted populations with the optimal serotiny level as seed-provisioning sources {{should be encouraged to}} ensure forest regrowth in fire-prone areas...|$|R

Rolling contact fatigue RCF tests were conducted using a modified four ball machine in conventional steel ball bearing and hybrid ceramic bearing configurations. These tests were conducted under various tribological conditions of contact stress and lubrication regimes at room temperature. Failure modes were investigated on the basis of surface and subsurface observations of failed coated rolling elements. Surface observations were made using conventional scanning electron Ž. microscopy SEM and light microscopy. Subsurface observations were made using fluorescent dye penetrant technique. Observations of Ž. debris generated during the RCF tests, changes in topography of lower planetary balls, electron probe microscope analysis EPMA, microhardnessrfracture toughness investigations and, coating microstructural studies are also included to aid the discussion. Two modes of failures, i. e., surface wear and coating delamination, were observed during this investigation. Coated rolling elements failed in either one or a combination of these two modes depending upon the tribological conditions during the RCF test. Surface wear was associated with asperity contact in the presence of microsliprsliding within the contact region. The process was accelerated in the later stages of RCF tests in the presence of wear debris due to additional mechanism of three body abrasion.

In some places it forms nearly pure stands and has been heavily exploited for its resin and for lumber. Three species, one of which merely represents leaf variations from another, have been proposed previously for this genus in Borneo (Warburg, 1900; Meijer Drees, 1940). Several hundred collection numbers {{can be found in}} the major herbaria, much the majority of which belong to one species. This is particularly true for the non-Asian herbaria. During several field trips to Borneo, however, I identified three additional quite distinct unnamed species. The great variability of leaf size and shape even on individual plants in this genus together with difficulty in making good representative collections from these immense trees has surely hindered the recognition of the distinctions to be described here. None of these species has been totally overlooked, to be sure, inasmuch as a few specimens of each have previously reached the major herbaria. Furthermore, Whitmore (1979) concluded after seeing some of this material that it did not correspond to any of the species already described from Borneo but in fact represented Agathis dammara, a species not actually found in Borneo.

Methods A retrospective review of prospectively collected data from 18 centers included in the Italian Registry was performed. From May 2008 to September 2013, 99 patients with end-stage heart failure were enrolled.

During follow-up, 6 patients underwent transplantation, and in 1 patient the left ventricular assist device was explanted. The cumulative incidence competing risk of the entire cohort for noncardiovascular-related death was 28 % (20 %- 40 %); the cumulative incidence competing risk for cardiovascular-related death was 56 % (42 %- 73 %) : 71 % in group pin versus 26 % in group cone (P =. 034). The multivariate analyses confirmed that the pin-bearing design was a risk factor for cardiovascular death, along with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support class. Right ventricular failures and ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes were significantly higher in group pin. Conclusions Patients with the new pump configuration showed a better freedom from cardiovascular death and lower incidence of fatal stroke and right ventricular failure. Further studies are needed to prove the favorable impact of pump-enhanced fluid dynamics on long-term results. © 2016 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presented}} {{the result of}} Cone Penetration Test (CPT) and empirical correlations between cone resistances (q c) with the undrained shear strength (S u) from the laboratory test. Unconsolidated-undrained (UU) triaxial and cone penetration test results were used to develop correlations between undrained shear strength and cone resistance for clay soil {{in the study area}} located on alluvial clay desposits in Banting, Selangor, Malaysia. An empirical correlation of Su with effective overburden pressure is developed and the <b>cone</b> <b>bearing</b> factor (N k) of 17 ± 8 is recomended using S u = ௤ ೎ ିఙ ே ೖ and N k of 28 ± 8 using S u ൌ ௤ ೎ ே ೎. The result shows that the N k valued is in the agreement with the published correlation. It is concluded that the correlation factors obtained in this study yet to be established for Malaysian clay due to inedequate data base. It is expected to improve once all the data base required within the Malaysia State can be collected incorporating with the current state of knowledge and practice regarding behavior of Malaysian Clay. 1. Introduction The cone penetration test (CPT) has been used for many years as a standard investigation tool, mainly to determine quickly the soil profile (through the friction ratio) {{as well as for the}} estimation of the undrained shear strength, S u, in the case of cohesive soils. Cone resistance (q c) usually varies directly with the undrained shear strength of clay (S u). Soil strength parameters use for design of foundation in Malaysia are mainly extract from Standard Penetration Test (SPT) result which sometimes might lead to an erroneous conclusion. This is due to the linearly interpolation between each SPT depth value at a minimum 1. 5 m depth...|$|R
