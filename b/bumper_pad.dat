2500|$|Product safety experts advise {{against using}} pillows, overly soft mattresses, sleep positioners, <b>bumper</b> <b>pads</b> (crib <b>bumpers),</b> stuffed animals, or fluffy bedding in the crib and {{recommend}} instead dressing the child warmly {{and keeping the}} crib [...] "naked." ...|$|R
40|$|As the Back to Sleep {{program has}} {{effectively}} decreased {{the incidence of}} SIDS, the residual causes of accidental deaths in infancy become more apparent. The recent discussions about the characteristics of bedding material, bed sharing and associations with smoking are examples of the scrutiny given to accidental deaths. In this issue of The Journal, Thach et al identify <b>bumper</b> <b>pads</b> used in cribs as another source of risk for injury and accidental death for infants. Their conclusions {{are based on the}} databases of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, which depend on what gets reported. Thus, there is neither an accurate numerator for the actual number of attributable injuries and deaths nor a denominator about frequency of use of <b>bumper</b> <b>pads.</b> Nevertheless, the probably low estimates do raise significant concerns that need to be recognized...|$|R

In original application, special fixture striker bar, round structural member lies {{at end of}} remote manipulator on space shuttle, and mechanism used to attach foot restraint for use by astronaut during extravehicular activity. On Earth, similar mechanisms and fixtures with suitably modified dimensions useful for temporary attachment of various items (e. g., safety harnesses) to structures or machines...|$|R
25|$|Placing {{an infant}} to sleep while {{lying on the}} stomach or the side {{increases}} the risk. This increased risk is greatest at {{two to three months}} of age. Elevated or reduced room temperature also increases the risk, as does excessive bedding, clothing, soft sleep surfaces, and stuffed animals. <b>Bumper</b> <b>pads</b> may increase the risk of SIDS due to the risk of suffocation. They are not recommended for children under one years of age as this risk of suffocation greatly outweighs the risk of head bumping or limbs getting stuck in the bars of the crib.|$|R
50|$|Bumpers (cushioning) are {{marketed to}} keep {{children}} from bumping against the hard sides and hurting themselves or becoming entrapped between the crib slats; breathable bumpers {{are intended to}} reduce the risk of suffocation. According to 2011 guidelines on safe sleep and SIDS prevention for babies released by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), traditional crib <b>bumper</b> <b>pads</b> should not be used. Their review shows no evidence that traditional crib bumpers protect against injury, but they do carry a potential risk of suffocation, strangulation, or entrapment because infants lack the motor skills or strength to turn their heads if they roll into something that obstructs their breathing. In fact, the sale of traditional crib bumpers has been banned in Chicago and Maryland, with the exemption of mesh alternatives or ones that wrap along the crib rails. Children's product safety non-profit, Kids In Danger is actively working to ban the sale of traditional crib bumpers in Illinois and throughout the country.. The ASTM F15.19 Infant Bedding SubCommittee is actively working to create additional testing standards and revised standards language.|$|R
5000|$|Additional STS features: Grille with {{flush-mounted}} wreath-and-crest, modified driver's {{front fender}} with the cornering light {{moved to the}} front facia and headlight monitors removed, matching body color front lower airdam and bodyside moldings, matte black export license pocket with bright bead, matte black front <b>bumper</b> impact <b>pads</b> and rear <b>bumper</b> guard vertical inserts, matching body color outside rearview mirrors with black patch, modified (from Eldorado) rear reflexes (moved to the bumper), modified export taillamps with three-color European-style lenses, STS nameplate on the decklid and an STS exclusive cloisonne deck lid lock cover.|$|R
2500|$|... 1987 saw {{changes to}} the front and rear fascias on the [...] "base coupe" [...] with the SE and GT models keeping the same [...] "Aero" [...] nose. The new non-aero noses lost the black <b>bumper</b> <b>pads</b> of the earlier models and had a {{smoother}} look. The four-cylinder engine's power rating increased to [...] with some major modifications which included a roller cam, redesigned intake manifold, distributorless ignition system (DIS), open combustion chamber cylinder head and upgraded throttle-body fuel injection system. This was the last year for the spin-on oil filter on the four-cylinder. Bright Blue (M21) and Medium Red Metallic (M77) were added and replacing the ribbed black molding was the round style found on the GT models. As a side note, the SE models retained the ribbed molding, and added the aero nose found on the GT. Redesigned headlight motors appeared in 1987. Additionally, starting with the 1987 model Pontiac dealerships offered an upgrade {{in the form of an}} [...] "option" [...] that changed the original body to a Pininfarina Ferrari 308-type body, called the Fiero Mera. Corporate Concepts completed the [...] "Mera" [...] transformation and none were sold as kit form. The Mera body change was offered only on new Fieros, sold through Pontiac dealers and is considered a class of car in its own right. Only 247 Mera's were produced by Corporate Concepts before production was halted when sued by Ferrari. With its limited number produced, the Pontiac Mera is one of the rarest American made automobiles.|$|R
5000|$|In 1965, {{race car}} builder Bill Stroppe {{assembled}} {{a team of}} Broncos for long-distance off-road competition. Partnering with Holman-Moody, the Stroppe/Holman/Moody (SHM) Broncos competed in the Mint 400, Baja 500, and Mexican 1000 (later named the Baja 1000). In 1969, SHM again entered a team of six Broncos in the Baja 1000. In 1971, a [...] "Baja Bronco" [...] package was marketed through Ford dealers, featuring quick-ratio power steering, automatic transmission, fender flares covering Gates Commando tires, a roll bar, reinforced <b>bumpers,</b> a <b>padded</b> steering wheel, and distinctive red, white, blue, and black paint. Priced at US$5,566, versus the standard V8 Bronco price of $3,665, only 650 were sold {{over the next four}} years.|$|R
