HTS steel structures are more sensitive to the welding residual stresses which affect the structural strength and fatigue. In this paper, the uncoupled finite element model is presented to predict the welding residual stress of <b>butt-welded</b> HTS steel plates based on the characteristics of welding thermo-mechanical cycles. The examples show that the results calculated by finite element method are in agreement with the experimental data.

40|$|Energy {{has both}} vital and {{strategically}} important features. It {{is known that}} 26 % of the energy consumed worldwide consists of natural gas. Since it is used so commonly, {{there are lots of}} parameters related to the junction process of polyethylene based pipes and fitting members used in natural gas transfer. There is no doubt that inappropriate choices of these parameters will cause substantial damages of no return. In this study, natural gas pipes (Pe 80 and Pe 100) are joined by hot <b>butt-welding</b> and some tests are performed in accordance with the parameters and conditions determined by standards. In light of data collected, it is analyzed if hot <b>butt-welding</b> has the necessary characteristics to meet the standards for plastic pipe junction.

40|$|Deformation and {{stresses}} in <b>butt-welding</b> {{of plates}} were studied. The work includes numerical simulation and experimental verification. The simulations were performed {{by use of}} the finite element method. Temperature dependence of material properties and phase transformations were considered. A thermo-elastoplastic material model was used. Plane stress conditions were assumed. Automatic <b>butt-welding</b> of plates without backing needs close tolerances of joint geometry. The thermally induced deformations and stresses are of great importance for joint geometry during welding. Therefore the change of gap width {{in front of the}} moving arc has been of special interest in these studies. The residual stresses, which may affect inservice behaviour of welded plates, were also calculated and measured. The tack-welds were found to influence the change in gap width in front of the moving arc. A proper tack-welding procedure is important in order to avoid large changes in gap width during <b>butt-welding.</b> The tack-welds should be made as soon after each other as possible. The sequence in which the tack-welds are made also affect the change in gap width. The gap width increased during {{the last part of the}} <b>butt-welding</b> in the simulations performed in this work. This increase was larger for wide plates than for narrow plates.

Then, some aspects of stability of a crack path are examined as to whether it may propagate, keeping its original direction or not in a homogeneous material, and whether crack kinking in a material having inhomogeneous fracture toughness may be predicted by seeking the state which gives rise to an energetically stable one.

These heads allow for more surface contact, reducing {{the time needed to}} heat and fuse the pipe. Socket fusion joins pipe and fittings together, rather than simply joining pipe to pipe. It requires less pressure than <b>butt-welding</b> and is more commonly used on smaller sizes of pipe (4" [...] or less). Socket welding has additional advantages of requiring less machinery and is more portable than the heavier equipment required for butt fusion.|$|R

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen new, {{emerging}} innovation of Ultrasonic Testing (UT). Specifically, multiple manufacturers have produced Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT) systems. The PAUT systems embed a matrix of multiple (some up to 128) single transducers into one probe used for scanning elastic materials. Simultaneously exciting multiple transducers offers distinct advantages; depending on the sequencing of transducer excitation, the ultrasonic beam could be steered within the material and multiple beams help develop extra dimensional data to assist with visualization of possible flaws including the discontinuity size, shape and location. Unfortunately, {{there has not been}} broad acceptance of PAUT in the bridge fabrication industry because it is currently not a recognized inspection technology in AWS D 1. 5. One situation in which the technology would excel would be inspection of Complete Joint Penetration (CJP) butt welds. Currently, AWS D 1. 5 required CJP welds subjected to tensile or reversal stresses only be inspected by Radiographic Testing (RT). However, discontinuities normally seen by RT can also be seen with PAUT. Until specification language is adopted into D 1. 5, there will continue to be hesitancy to use PAUT for the inspection of CJP butt welds.
