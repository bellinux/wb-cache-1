5|$|Trying to {{cast the}} role of Garrison, Stone sent copies of the script to Costner, Mel Gibson, and Harrison Ford. Initially, Costner turned Stone down.

5|$|In November 2010 sources {{reported}} that director Vishnuvardhan would direct a film featuring Pawan Kalyan {{in the lead}} role, to be produced by Neelima Nagesh and Shobu Yarlagadda. Neelima in an interview stated {{that she was a}} <b>big</b> <b>fan</b> of Pawan Kalyan. Vishnnuvardhan, following the release of his 2009 film Sarvam, which fared poorly at the box office, had been working on two scripts – the other one being the prequel to the 2007 version of Billa – but was unable to start either project due to unavailable dates of Pawan Kalyan and Ajith Kumar. He had planned to shoot both projects simultaneously from March 2011 onwards, but since that was not possible, he was forced to drop one of the projects, with Vishnuvardhan eventually deciding to direct this film. Reports also claimed that Krish, director of critically acclaimed films Gamyam (2008) and Vedam (2010), would pen the dialogues for the film, besides revealing that it would feature two female leads. It turned out that Abburi Ravi was roped in to write the dialogues, while the screenplay was provided by Rahul Koda.|$|E
