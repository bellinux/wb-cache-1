40|$|My Bachelor Thesis is a {{comprehensive}} survey about the children´s broadcasts on Estonian Radio in the years of 1946 to 1970. The first paragraph shortly describes the radio as a specific medium and its influences on the children, {{the functions of the}} broadcasts and the Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) used in the main analyzation. In the second paragraph I have tried to give background information that would help to put the era´s children´s broadcasts into the contemporary social context – it is described the society´s background by the time as well as the role of journalism in the society. I have also taken a deeper view into the ER´s role and importance amongst the other mediums. Already in the 1960 s the board of Estonian Radio started to get interested in the ratings of their programs. The survey concerning of children´s broadcasts was made in 1967 - its results have shortly been referred in the second paragraph of the current study. The last sub- paragraph of the second main paragraph expands the position of the radio´s editorial desk {{in the structure of the}} ER and also the structural changes that occurred. The most important change for the children´s <b>broadcast</b> <b>editor</b> desk happened in 1953 when the editors of children and youth programmes were separated. In the new structure the children´s programmes were to lead by art editors, youth programmes became a part of the editor desk dealing with political programmes. The third paragraph mainly focuses on methods and description of the material used in the survey. The fourth paragraph gives a clarifying view about the children broadcasts in 1927 - 1970. Although the period from 1927 to 1945 was not the survey objective in my thesis, I have expanded it shortly, considering it impossible to describe the changes that have taken place in the content of radio programs and genres without knowing the previous periods. Periodising is mainly based on a current political situation of every period. The fifth paragraph consists of various parts. In the sub-paragraph I have contemplated the amendment requirements for children broadcasts presented in the Radio Committee board member guidings in 1950 s. The macroanalysis of the programmes divides into 2 macroanalysis´ of two separate periods (1946 to 1957 and 1958 to 1970). In the macroanalysis it has been viewed into programmes´ themes, genres, structure, interpersonal communication with the listener, the functions of programmes and the values and ideals presented in radio broadcasts. Microanalysis is divided into two parts based on the diversity of two different parts. Microanalysis focuses on the variability of vocabulary ja grammar, the our-discourse content, the social identities of the participiants and the themes given by children in the viewed broadcasts. In the last sub-paragraph I have juxtaposed the described era´s broadcasts with the program called „Children´s Sayings” („Lapsesuu”) which is currently in the ER´s programme this season (May 2007). Survey conclusions. The main principles of how to make a radio programme have changed a lot within the years. If the first radio broadcast was often only (starting from 1927) about reading out of fictional texts or playing music, then in the 1960 ´s many qualitative changes happened. The children´s broadcasts transformed into live programmes which were to stimulate the radio listeners to participate in making the radio programmes. The best example of this improvement would obviously be the broadcast „Poiste Klubi” („Boys´ Club”) that first appeared on the programme in 1967. Nevertheless quite good examples can also be the live chess plays, literature contests and quizzes put into the programmes that all required people´s active participation. The functions of the radio broadcasts massively changed in time. The programs in 1946 – 1957 are severely distinguished by the fact that ideological themes were violently forced into every broadcasting programme. The radio programmes from 1957 to 1970 s are rather apolitical, programmes holding an ideological function separate into specific series, educational and entertaining programs and series begin to dominate instead. The natural part of a children´s broadcast was the children´s interviews. In 1960 s it was started to concentrate on children´s participation - it became significant to give an opportunity to children themselves to make and broadcast programmes. The radio organised contests for children to find the radio performers, a few programmes were made where both creators and performers were exclusively children...|$|E

40|$|This {{study of}} the {{production}} of British broadcast journalism, rather than its finished products, reveals {{the ways in which}} the organising and financing of journalism have traceable consequences on the ways in which news is selected and constructed, supporting the critical political economy perspective. Using a comparative ethnographic approach including interviews and observation of professional practice in three local television newsrooms, studios and other production spaces, this study represents a rare opportunity to gain insights into the ways in which events, issues and sources are selected by journalists, editors, producers and others engaged in the production of British broadcast news and how material is shaped into news bulletins and other programming. Drawing on news value theory (Galtung and Ruge 1965; Golding and Elliott 1979; Harcup and O’Neil 2001, 2016), the study offers a new model of news value analysis, the ‘News Value Matrix’, which takes account of the interplay between two key categories of news values, organisational pragmatics and perceptions of audience appeal.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis on}} the subject Children And Youth Broadcasts On Estonian Radio From The 1960 ‟s Until Today: interviews with editors was {{to find out what}} the programmes aimed at young people were like in the 1960 ‟s, in the beginning of the 1990 ‟s and at the end of 2000. Also, to point out the main differences between the periods as well as to learn about the children and youth‟s interest in radio shows in 2011. To obtain the necessary information for this thesis, interviews with children or youth <b>broadcast</b> <b>editors</b> were conducted, six of whom worked on the radio in the 1960 s, one in the beginning of the 1990 s and one who is currently employed as an editor of such programmes. In addition, four children and four youths were interviewed to learn about their habits of listening to broadcasts in 2011. Furthermore, the newspapers “Raadioleht” from the ‟ 60 ‟s and ‟ 90 ‟s were analysed to find out about specific facts. Throughout time several changes have taken place concerning children‟s shows. Although the content and subjects have stayed almost the same as children have always had the same kind of interests, the duration of the shows has decreased. The broadcasts used to be on air seven days a week, but in 2011 the shows are broadcast only on weekdays except for daily bedtime stories. Also, the number of shows has declined; today there are only four children‟s shows on Vikerraadio, whereas during the Soviet times the number of broadcasts was considerably higher. The orientation of youth programmes has stayed more or less the same throughout the years. Narrowcasting has always been problematic as the notion of „youth‟ can be widely interpreted; in addition, the range of subjects for young people is similar to the ones targeted at adults. Whilst during the Soviet times the youth broadcasts were aired a few times a week, then in 1993 a radio station for youths, Raadio 2, was founded. From the interviews with the children and the teens it became apparent that they are mostly interested in radio stations that play music. They do not listen to talk shows because of lack of time and interest. They have many extracurricular activities, and in the evenings, when they would have time to listen to the radio, no programmes directed to them are on air. According to the editors, the programmes targeted at children and youths should be maintained in the future as talk shows on the radio play an important role in the life of each individual. Children‟s shows should be continued the way they have been; youth broadcasts do not need to be accentuated – they should just be included in the programme. Although broadcasts can be listened to on the Internet after they have been aired, radio shows can also take advantage of other possibilities provided by the World Wide Web...|$|R
40|$|RECOMMENDATION REQUIRES EFFORT Collaborative {{filtering}} {{methods have}} been applied {{to a number of}} domains like books, videos, audio CDs and Usenet news. These systems require some {{effort on the part of}} users before they can generate recommendations (see for example [5] on the 9 ̆ 3 cold-start 9 ̆ 4 problem). How much effort they require depends on domain and application. Some recommender systems for books or videos require rating a specific number of items before they generate the first prediction. If users can save money by not buying the wrong books and videos this effort might pay off. The Usenet news filter GroupLens [2] gathers ratings while users read articles so the process of building the profile and getting recommendations is interleaved. This strategy might lower the threshold for getting started. How much effort a user is willing to make depends not only on the domain but also on the personal value of the recommendation. Users who depend on the information in a newsgroup might make every required effort, but occasional users with a less serious information interest might not. To summarize: The higher the required effort the more potential users will quit. Recommending TV programs has much in common with recommending Usenet news articles. Like news articles TV programs are a daily updating stream unlike the rather stable databases within book and video recommender systems. There is a relatively high number of programs/ newsgroup articles every day. Recommendation is supposed to help users to cope with the flood and to find the few interesting items for them. How much effort are users going to spend on TV recommendations? Interviews showed: Not much. 9 ̆ 3 I don 9 ̆ 2 t watch much TV anyway 9 ̆ 4, 9 ̆ 3 I just want to know what 9 ̆ 2 s on tonight 9 ̆ 4 and so on. It seems that TV doesn 9 ̆ 2 t have much value to people, although statistics show that people do spend a lot of time watching. All users we asked already had experience with printed guides, which gave them a rather clear expectation of what a TV guide should do. Traditionally, both TV and TV guides have been broadcast media. TV makers <b>broadcast,</b> viewers watch. <b>Editors</b> write, readers read. Interactive and collaborative concepts are new here. It is obviously a risky undertaking to try to introduce new techniques in such a 9 ̆ 3 where is the beef 9 ̆ 4 situation. DESIGN GOALS The low disposition of interviewed persons to spend much effort on TV guides was the motivation for our group to try out a new way of gathering ratings. We made two basic design decisions: (a) don 9 ̆ 2 t ask users to do something they don 9 ̆ 2 t have an immediate benefit from and (b) don 9 ̆ 2 t overtax users with concepts unknown to them like rating, relevance or recommendation. Figure 1 gives an overview of our recommendation engine. Before programs reach users they are first globally rated and ranked according to the size-of-the-audience ratings (see below). Then they are selected according to user-individual genre profiles. Personal rating offsets are added. Next, programs are presented to the users as ordered lists or tables. Individual programs in the lists and tables are color-coded to indicate the personalized ratings. From these lists and tables users choose the programs they actually want to watch and collect them in their personal laundry lists. The laundry list serves as a reminder which can be printed out and taken to the VCR or TV set. Preliminary user tests suggest that the laundry list is perceived as a useful tool. To avoid any additional questioning we use the content of users 9 ̆ 2 laundry lists as an input for recommendation generation. Programs in the laundry lists are interpreted as being rated high and recommended to other users. This approach has similarities with the implicit ratings deduced from reading time of newsgroup articles described in [6]. Laundry list content is processed by the two modules sizeof- the-audience rating and opinion leaders. 9 ̆ 3 SIZE OF THE AUDIENCE 9 ̆ 4 The size-of-the-audience rating generates a general ranking of all programs. The rating of an individual program is calculated as the number of times the program occurs in users 9 ̆ 2 laundry lists. The more often a program has been selected for viewing the higher the rating. The size-of-the audience rating can lead users 9 ̆ 2 attention to unexpected events that are not covered by personal profiles. In Germany, for example, the Tour de France came first into the focus of public interest when the German Telekom team was very successful in 1997. Although (or because) it is not personalized, the size-of-the-audience rating can be useful for detecting such events. OPINION LEADERS Since the ratings delivered by the size-of-the-audience ratings are general to all users, so-called opinion leaders are added as a source of more distinct, personal and higher quality recommendation. Opinion leaders are users that publish their otherwise private laundry list along with their names in a public folder. The system offers and recommends opinion leaders like it recommends genres. 9 ̆ 3 You could have found all these programs more easily if you had subscribed to the genre Basketball and the opinion leader Lars Brückner. Do you want to do that now? 9 ̆ 4 How to become an opinion leader? Based on user profiles and laundry lists a program can estimate which users 9 ̆ 2 selections could be of interest for the community. Candidates should a) correlate with many other users, b) cover interest areas not yet covered by enough opinion leaders and c) use the laundry list on a regular basis. If these requirements are fulfilled the system will suggest that a user becomes an opinion leader. Being an opinion leader requires no extra work. But to deserve their name we want them to select more accurately or even to rate or annotate programs. Why should users do the extra work? 9 ̆ 3 Ways to provide compensatory benefits to those group members need to be found 9 ̆ 4 [3, p. 810]. We have to reward them. One way is to organize the opinion leaders in a competitive way and to reward the winners. The success of an opinion leader can be measured in subscriptions, i. e. the number of users that selected them as their favorites. Concept Tour de France: a) display opinion leaders ordered by their success as a leader board. The currently first and most successful one wears the yellow jersey b) reward the best ones by giving awards and prices at the end of each stage c) drop the least successful one when new users apply. DISCUSSION The central element of the suggested no-extra-effort rating system is the laundry list. Certainly: The laundry list is a magnitude less powerful than explicit seven-items scale ratings: It provides only Boolean input, reasons for selecting and not selecting items are ambiguous and it can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies. The applied technique shows similarities to last year 9 ̆ 2 s experiments at MyYahoo to correlate users according to uploaded bookmark lists. On the other hand the laundry list approach frees us from explaining users that they will help generating recommendations using it. The direct utility of the laundry list avoids lots of the trouble of explaining, convincing and persuading users to rate. This solves much of the general problem that many users experience the promised benefit associated with rating as being far away. After all, recommendation is a rather abstract concept and the question is how many first time users are willing to learn enough about it for it to become an incentive. But at the end, those users that want more than the mainstream recommendation of the size-of-the-audience rating do have to spend some effort. The system can suggest opinion leaders, but since these suggestions are based on the less informative laundry lists, users will have to check and fine tune to get equally good results as they would with systems using ratings on seven-items scales. How do opinion leaders relate to those systems where the virtual community is selected by the computer? In those systems one 9 ̆ 2 s virtual community can change by the hour. Opinion leaders are an attempt using active collaborative filtering [5] to provide 9 ̆ 3 names 9 ̆ 4 behind recommendations, like a large set of editors 9 ̆ 6 along with the option to become one. Hill et al. state: 9 ̆ 3 Recommendation and evaluations should come from people, not a black box machine or so-called agent 9 ̆ 4 [4, p. 196]. The opinion leader concept is built on the assumption of role specialization: 9 ̆ 3 Yet there is evidence that people naturally prefer to play distinct producer/consumer roles in the information ecology 9 ̆ 4 [1, p. 60]. It divides users into two distinct groups: A large majority of consumers that contribute only a little to a mass-average and a group of self-selected leaders that are willing to spend more effort on the system for getting social or monetary reward. How far can we get at zero user effort? We need more user tests to find out how much information we can draw out of implicit ratings and which other techniques can be applied to edit them and offer them to users. This will be subject to evaluations that will follow our online debut in May...|$|R
