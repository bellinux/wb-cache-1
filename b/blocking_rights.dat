50|$|The hill fort was fenced off for {{a number}} of years after 1950 when the then owner {{surrounded}} it with barbed wire and erected a large iron water tank for cattle. This prompted controversy for <b>blocking</b> <b>rights</b> of way and harming the view, and was eventually removed.In 1977, the Goring estate set about replanting areas of the ring to replace trees which were at the end of their natural lifespan. This provided West Sussex County Council with an opportunity to carry out a further archaeological investigation of the site, which was accomplished during July and August of that year.|$|E
50|$|ACPA Blocking Rules - “Blocking” - The Shooter has {{the primary}} {{right to the}} table. The Shooter {{has a right to}} get to the Shooter Ball without being blocked by the Defender. The Shooter has a right to make a shot. There will be no Blocking of the Shooter’s {{movement}} on the Runway along the long sides of the CRUD Table. In some cases, the Shooter will need to go around a Defender who is up {{against the side of the}} Table. Inadvertent or accidental long side Blocking, as determined by the Judge, will not be held against the Defender The Defender has <b>blocking</b> <b>rights</b> based on the following:-- The Defender may not touch either of the CRUD balls or the Shooter’s forearm or hand during a shot.-- The Defender may not hold onto any portion of the Table. -- Once established in a position to block the Shooter’s shot, the Defender may not move his feet to re-establish another position as the Shooter moves around the Defender. If the Shooter moves to the other end of the table, this rule then applies at that end. -- During Blocking, the Defender’s hands and arms must be constantly moving and closer to the Object Ball than the Shooter’s face, and the hands and arms may not go below the level of the bumpers. If the Defender’s hands are swept away by the Shooter, the Defender may readjust and try again. -- The Defender may offer resistance, but may not use holding techniques and must be “giving way” without “over-resistance” to the Shooter’s attempt to establish position for a shot. The Shooter is only entitled to “take” as much room as is reasonably required to make a shot. The use of hard pushing or hitting with the hands, elbows, shoulders or hips by either the Shooter or the Defender to establish or maintain their position is not allowed. -- The Player on Deck has no <b>Blocking</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E
50|$|He {{joined the}} {{marketing}} department of DaimlerChrysler Aerospace in 1991 and held several functions at DASA {{until he was}} promoted to head the defence and security systems business in the frame of the merger of EADS in 2000. In 2005, he was appointed co-CEO (first with co-CEO Noël Forgeard, then Louis Gallois), a role he relinquished in 2007 when the company modified its corporate governance, giving away with double-CEO and double-Chairman structures. As a result of the governance change, Enders was appointed CEO of Airbus, the Group’s largest Division.In May 2012, the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders approved Enders' nomination to become CEO of EADS. Shortly after his nomination, Enders embarked on a plan to merge with UK-based BAE Systems, which would have created the world’s leading defence company. However, the merger plan - the only remaining realistic opportunity to fulfill the company’s Vision2020 strategy - failed ultimately due to political intervention. In late 2012, EADS and its shareholders - namely Daimler AG, Lagardère and the French state - agreed to revamp the company’s corporate governance, thereby considerably reducing political influence in the Group. Although Germany, France and Spain are shareholders of the group, none hold any special <b>blocking</b> <b>rights,</b> meaning the company is governed solely by the Board of Directors and the Executive Management. After the failure of the merger with BAE Systems, Enders initiated a review of the company’s strategy, which was completed in July 2013. Among others, the outcome resulted in the rebranding of the Group from EADS to Airbus Group in January 2014.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the case}} studies of India and Sri Lanka, the paper {{combines}} conceptual and empirical findings on power-sharing arrangements {{as a key to}} conflict management in deeply divided, post-colonial societies. The two countries were chosen because of the similarity of their ethnopolitical conflicts but also because of their differences in conflict management practices and outcomes. For the case study on India, I argue that by applying power sharing principles the conflicts resulting from demands of minorities, such as homeland and linguistic recognition, were met through provisions based on the principle of segmental autonomy; demands for proportional representation in political decision-making were met through the specificity of “centric-regional” parties and through policies of reservation; whereas demands for security, such as preservation of cultural identity were met through segmental autonomy as well as formal and informal <b>blocking</b> <b>rights.</b> Conversely, Sri Lanka was originally blessed with favorable conditions at independence, but sub-optimal political choices after independence turned “milder ethnic conflict” into a protracted civil war. I argue that a policy based on a majoritarian control system was {{at the root of the}} ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. Two interrelated claims are advanced. Based on the consociational approach, 1) in a deeply divided society, conflict regulation can be achieved only through adoption of power sharing arrangements; and based on the majoritarian “control” approach: 2) in a deeply divided society majoritarian practices will exacerbate rather than regulate a conflict...|$|E

Blockage of both the right and left bundle branches would be tantamount to block at these locations. This is the well-es-tablished concept of bilateral bundle-branch block. 1 - 3 It highlights a hazard inherent in catheterization of the ventricle opposite that which is already the site of bundle-branch block.
