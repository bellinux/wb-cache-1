25|$|Up until 1918, Lalonde cleverly used a {{specific}} rule of hockey – which stipulated that goaltenders could not drop {{to their knees}} to block shots – to compliment his superb accuracy. Coming off the right wing or down the centre, he would unleash a “wicked knee-high shot” which would catch the opposing goalie between the glove – or stick – and pad. This shot placement was deliberately done in order to slow down a goalie’s reaction time; they were often unable to decide between using their glove hand or blocker hand to deflect or catch the puck, and shuffling to {{one side or the}} other to use their pads. Lalonde’s snapper was so lethal that opposing coaches would often assign three to four of their own players just to shadow him, and – in one of the earliest iterations of the trap – attempt to pin him into a corner in order to prevent his <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into a scoring position.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} batting in {{partnership}} {{becomes even more}} vital once only one recognised quality batsman remains. His job is then to shepherd the tail-end batsmen, while attempting to eke out as many runs as possible, or simply to survive {{as long as possible}} when merely attempting to save the game. This usually involves attempting to minimise risk, by exposing the lesser batsmen to as little bowling as possible. To do this, boundaries and twos are preferred while singles are avoided in the early parts of an over (although this allows the fielding captain to set his field further back into a more defensive position, often tempting the batsman with an easy single) but because the bowling end changes {{at the end of an}} over, it is necessary to score a single (or much more rarely, three runs) to counteract this. While a single on the sixth and final ball of the over would be ideal, the field is usually set closer to make this harder and the batsman may prefer to rotate the strike on the fifth or even fourth ball, hoping that the tail-ender can survive for a delivery or two, rather than risking either having to take a dangerous run on the last ball (with the attendant risk of a run out) or not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a single at all, leaving the tail-ender stranded on strike for the start of the next over (hence allowing up to six balls to be bowled at him).|$|E

40|$|High-dimensional {{large sample}} data sets, between feature {{variables}} and between samples, may cause some correlative or repetitive factors, occupy lots of storage space, and consume much computing time. Using the Elman neural network {{to deal with}} them, too many inputs will influence the operating efficiency and recognition accuracy; too many simultaneous training samples, as well as <b>being</b> not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> precise neural network model, also restrict the recognition accuracy. Aiming at these series of problems, we introduce the partial least squares (PLS) and cluster analysis (CA) into Elman neural network algorithm, by the PLS for dimension reduction which can eliminate the correlative and repetitive factors of the features. Using CA eliminates the correlative and repetitive factors of the sample. If some subclass becomes small sample, with high-dimensional feature and fewer numbers, PLS shows a unique advantage. Each subclass is regarded as one training sample to train the different precise neural network models. Then simulation samples are discriminated and classified into different subclasses, using the corresponding neural network to recognize it. An optimized Elman neural network classification algorithm based on PLS and CA (PLS-CA-Elman algorithm) is established. The new algorithm aims at improving the operating efficiency and recognition accuracy. By the case analysis, the new algorithm has unique superiority, worthy of further promotion...|$|R

40|$|An {{introductory}} formal languages course exposes advanced {{undergraduate and}} early graduate students to automata theory, grammars, constructive proofs, computability, and decidability. Programming students find these topics to be challenging or, in many cases, overwhelming {{and on the}} fringe of Computer Science. The existence of this perception is not completely absurd since students are asked to design and prove correct machines and grammars without <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> experiment nor <b>get</b> immediate feedback, which is essential in a learning context. This article puts forth the thesis that the theory of computation ought to be taught using tools for actually building computations. It describes the implementation and the classroom use of a library, FSM, designed to provide students with the opportunity to experiment and test their designs using state machines, grammars, and regular expressions. Students are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> perform random testing before proceeding with a formal proof of correctness. That is, students can test their designs much like they do in a programming course. In addition, the library easily allows students to implement the algorithms they develop as part of the constructive proofs they write.

60|$|One of Roswell's first objects was to {{transport}} {{most of the}} eatables from the wreck; for he foresaw the need there would be for everything of the sort. Neither vessel had laid in a stock of provisions {{for a longer period}} than about twelve months, of which nearly half were now gone. This allowance applied to salted meats and bread, which are usually regarded as the base of a ship's stores. There were several barrels of flour, a few potatoes, a large quantity of onions, a few barrels of corn-meal, or 'injin,' as it is usually termed in American parlance, an entire barrel of pickled cucumbers, another about half full of cabbage preserved in the same way, and an entire barrel of molasses. In addition, there was a cask of whiskey, a little wine and brandy to be used medicinally, sugar, brown, whitey-brown and browny-white, and a pretty fair allowance of tea and coffee; the former being a Hyson-skin, and the latter San Domingo of no very high quality. Most of these articles were transported from the wreck to the house, {{in the course of the}} few days that succeeded, though Daggett insisted on a certain portion of the supplies being left in his stranded craft. Not until this was done would Roswell listen to any proposal of Daggett's to transfer the skins. Twice during these few days, indeed, did the Vineyard master come to a pause in his proceedings, as the weather grew milder, and gleams of a hope of <b>being</b> <b>able</b> yet <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away that season crossed his mind. On the last of these occasions of misgiving, Roswell was compelled to lead his brother master up on the plain of the island, to an elevation of some three hundred feet above the level of the ocean, and more than half that distance higher than the house, and point out to him a panorama of field-ice that the eye could not command. Until that vast plain opened, or became riven by the joint action of the agitated ocean and the warmth of a sun from which the rays did not glance away from the frozen surface, like light obliquely received, and as obliquely reflected from a mirror, it was useless to think of releasing even the uninjured vessel; much less that which lay riven and crushed on the rocks.|$|R
