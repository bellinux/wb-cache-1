25|$|Romanesque doorways have a {{character}} form, with the jambs having {{a series of}} receding planes, into {{each of which is}} set a circular shaft, all surmounted by a continuous abacus. The semi-circular arch which rises from the abacus has the same seried planes and circular mouldings as the jambs. There are typically four planes containing three shafts, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> as many as twelve shafts, symbolic of the apostles.|$|E
25|$|Each side of {{the pelvis}} is formed as cartilage, which ossifies as three main bones which stay {{separate}} through childhood: ilium, ischium, pubis. At birth {{the whole of the}} hip joint (the acetabulum area and the top of the femur) is still made of cartilage (<b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a small piece of bone in the great trochanter of the femur); this makes it difficult to detect congenital hip dislocation by X-raying.|$|E

25|$|In a {{meta-analysis}} of 88 studies, drinking soda correlates with {{a decrease in}} milk consumption along with the vitamin D, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, calcium, protein and other micronutrients. Phosphorus, a micronutrient, {{can be found in}} cola-type beverages, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a risk in consuming too much. Phosphorus and calcium are used in the body to create calcium-phosphate, which is the main component of bone. However, the combination of too much phosphorus with too little calcium in the body can lead to a degeneration of bone mass.|$|E
25|$|There must be {{at least}} one sekiwake and komusubi {{on each side of the}} banzuke, {{normally}} two total, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more. Although there is usually a yokozuna there is no requirement for one, and it has sometimes happened that no active yokozuna or no ōzeki were listed in the ranks. If there is more than one yokozuna but only one ōzeki, the lower rank will be filled out by designating one of the yokozuna as yokozuna-ōzeki. There is no recorded instance of there being fewer than two yokozuna and ōzeki in total.|$|E
25|$|Second-generation fuels require either higher {{confinement}} temperatures {{or longer}} confinement time than those required of first-generation fusion fuels, but generate fewer neutrons. Neutrons are an unwanted byproduct of fusion reactions in an energy generation context, {{because they are}} absorbed by {{the walls of a}} fusion chamber, making them radioactive. They cannot be confined by magnetic fields, because they are not electrically charged. This group consists of deuterium and helium-3. The products are all charged particles, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> significant side reactions leading to the production of neutrons.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{cause of}} aphthous {{stomatitis}} is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a genetic predisposition in some people. Other possible causes include hematinic deficiency (folate, vitamin B, iron), stopping smoking, stress, menstruation, trauma, food allergies or hypersensitivity to {{sodium lauryl sulphate}} (found in many brands of toothpaste). Aphthous stomatitis has no clinically detectable signs or symptoms outside the mouth, but the recurrent ulceration can cause much discomfort to sufferers. Treatment is aimed at reducing the pain and swelling and speeding healing, and may involve systemic or topical steroids, analgesics (pain killers), antiseptics, anti-inflammatories or barrier pastes to protect the raw area(s).|$|E
25|$|The town of Opotiki is {{situated}} exactly on latitude 38° South. The climate is temperate. Summer temperatures reach the mid-20s (Celsius, mid-70s Fahrenheit) {{on the coast}} and encourage {{a continuation of the}} beach culture of the Bay of Plenty. Winter days are often cloudless, the daytime temperature never drops below freezing <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a mild frost at night. Winter snow falls along the crest of the ranges, and on the higher peaks (over 1000 m) may remain for a few weeks. Rain occurs at any season. Severe localised rainstorms ('cloudbursts') may occur in the high country and have caused flash flooding including past inundations of Opotiki township.|$|E
25|$|Like the Doric Order, the Ionic Order retains {{signs of}} having {{its origins in}} wooden architecture. The {{horizontal}} spread of a flat timber plate {{across the top of}} a column is a common device in wooden construction, giving a thin upright a wider area on which to bear the lintel, {{while at the same time}} reinforcing the load-bearing strength of the lintel itself. Likewise, the columns always have bases, a necessity in wooden architecture to spread the load and protect the base of a comparatively thin upright. The columns are fluted with narrow, shallow flutes that do not meet at a sharp edge but have a flat band or fillet between them. The usual number of flutes is twenty-four <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> as many as forty-four. The base has two convex mouldings called torus, and from the late Hellenic period stood on a square plinth similar to the abacus.|$|E

500|$|The {{number of}} legal {{positions}} in chess {{is estimated to}} be about 1043, and is provably [...] less than 1047, with a game-tree complexity of approximately 10123. The game-tree complexity of chess was first calculated by Claude Shannon as 10120, a number known as the Shannon number. Typically an average position has thirty to forty possible moves, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> as few as zero (in the case of checkmate or stalemate) or as many as 218.|$|E
500|$|In March 1911, Shay {{was riding}} in a taxi that {{collided}} with a dray and he sustained severe cuts to his face. A newspaper report said that Shay might miss a portion of spring training. Shay was suspended indefinitely in late June 1911 after a fight with an umpire. In October 1911, Shay abruptly resigned as the manager in Kansas City. He declined to say what prompted his resignation {{and said that he}} might not be permanently finished with baseball, but {{he said that he was}} finished with the Kansas City club. When asked about the possibility of a major league managing job, Shay responded, [...] "There is nothing to be said now, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> something later." ...|$|E

500|$|Syphilis is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. The {{signs and symptoms of}} syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary). The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre (a firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration) <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> multiple sores. In secondary syphilis a diffuse rash occurs, which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina. In latent syphilis, which can last for years, there are few or no symptoms. In tertiary syphilis there are gummas (soft non-cancerous growths), neurological, or heart symptoms. Syphilis has been known as [...] "the great imitator" [...] as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases.|$|E
500|$|The {{spore print}} of A.bisporigera, like most Amanita, is white. The spores are roughly spherical, thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), amyloid, and measure 7.8–9.6 by 7.0–9.0 μm. The cap cuticle {{is made of}} {{partially}} gelatinized, filamentous interwoven hyphae, 2–6μm in diameter. The tissue of the gill is bilateral, meaning it diverges {{from the center of}} the gill to its outer edge. The subhymenium is ramose—composed of relatively thin branching, unclamped hyphae. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, thin-walled, without clamps, with dimensions of 34–45 by 4–11μm. They are typically two-spored, although rarely three- or four-spored forms have been found. Although the two-spored basidia are a defining characteristic of the species, there is evidence of a tendency to shift towards producing four-spored basidia as the fruiting season progresses. The volva is composed almost exclusively of densely interwoven filamentous hyphae, 2–10μm in diameter, that are sparsely to moderately branched. There are few small inflated cells, which are mostly spherical to broadly elliptic. The tissue of the stipe is made of abundant, sparsely branched, filamentous hyphae, without clamps, measuring 2–5μm in diameter. The inflated cells are club-shaped, longitudinally oriented, and up to 2–3 by 15.7μm. The annulus is made of abundant moderately branched filamentous hyphae, measuring 2–6μm in diameter. The inflated cells are sparse, broadly elliptic to pear-shaped, and are rarely larger than 31 by 22μm. [...] and [...] (cystidia found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> cylindrical to sac-like cells of the partial veil on the gill edges; these cells are hyaline and measure 24–34 by 7–16μm.|$|E
500|$|In September 2006 Pope Benedict XVI gave {{a speech}} on the {{question}} of the [...] "reasonableness" [...] of the Christian faith, to the University of Regensburg in Germany. In the Regensburg lecture he spoke about rationality in faith, and cited comments by the fourteenth-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, who, as the Pope put it, said [...] "show me just what Mohamed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached." [...] The citation attracted severe criticism from Muslims around the world, including the parliament of Pakistan which condemned the Pope for his comments, and which sought an apology from him. [...] Following the speech, on 17 September Choudary led a protest outside Westminster Cathedral, where he told reporters [...] "Whoever insults the message of Mohammed is going to be subject to capital punishment." [...] The Daily Mail reported him as saying: [...] "I am here [...] have a peaceful demonstration, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> people in Italy and other parts that would carry that out." [...] The Metropolitan Police investigated his comments, but concluded that [...] "no substantive offences" [...] were committed during the demonstration. The Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, who had called for action to be taken against Choudary, said: [...] "It is quite disgraceful. It sends out a message to Muslim extremists that we, as a country, do not have the moral courage to stand up to them." ...|$|E
