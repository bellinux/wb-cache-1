25|$|Windows Live OneCare <b>Backup</b> <b>and</b> <b>Restore</b> is the {{component}} that aids in backing up important files. Files can be backed up to various recordable media, such as external hard disks, CDs, and DVDs. When restoring files, the entirety or {{a subset of}} them can also be restored to a networked computer, as long as it's running OneCare as well. The <b>Backup</b> <b>and</b> <b>Restore</b> component supports backup software features such as incremental backups and scheduling.|$|E
25|$|<b>Backup</b> <b>and</b> <b>Restore</b> Center {{also known}} as Windows Backup Status and Configuration replaces NTBackup {{although}} Windows NT Backup Restore Utility is available for download. <b>Backup</b> <b>and</b> <b>Restore</b> Center operates in two modes: (a) Backup or restore selected files or (b) Complete PC Backup. If using Complete PC Backup, incremental snapshots are stored on external hard disk or optical media, and the complete system can be restored to protect against hardware failure or severe software damage. Automatic scheduling of file backups is not available in Vista Home Basic. Complete PC Backup is not available in Vista Home Basic and Home Premium.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} (speed) of ext3 is {{less attractive}} than competing Linux filesystems, such as ext4, JFS, ReiserFS, and XFS, but ext3 {{has a significant}} advantage in that it allows in-place upgrades from ext2 without having to <b>backup</b> <b>and</b> <b>restore</b> data. Benchmarks suggest that ext3 also uses less CPU power than ReiserFS and XFS. It is also considered safer than the other Linux file systems, due to its relative simplicity and wider testing base.|$|E

50|$|Many {{businesses}} require <b>backups</b> of servers <b>and</b> {{the special}} applications or databases {{that run on}} them, such as groupware, SQL, ERP- or CRM-systems and directory services. This requires not only regular file-based approach, but specific point-in-time <b>backups</b> <b>and</b> <b>restores</b> for databases.|$|R
25|$|Security and Maintenance (formerly Action Center {{and before}} that, Security Center) is a {{monitoring}} {{component of the}} Windows NT family of operating system. It monitors the security and maintenance status of the computer. Its monitoring criteria includes optimal operation of personal firewalls, anti-virus software and anti-spyware software, {{as well as the}} working status of Network Access Protection, Windows Update, User Account Control, Windows Error Reporting and <b>Backup</b> <b>and</b> <b>Restore.</b> It notifies the user of any problem with the monitored criteria, e.g. when an antivirus program is not up-to-date or is offline.|$|E

5000|$|June 1993: Sybase announces {{its latest}} {{generation}} of software—named the System 10 product family; this {{consisted of the}} Database server, Replication Server for keeping replicate data up-to-date in near real time, and Navigation Server which had been developed in partnership with NCR to do shared nothing parallelisation across large numbers of databases. Backup Server was introduced to do high performance parallel <b>backups</b> <b>and</b> <b>restores.</b> SQL Monitor <b>and</b> SA Companion were provided to manage multiple servers.|$|R
50|$|Acronis True Image {{can make}} {{two types of}} backups: file backup, backing up user-specified files and directories, and full system images, which are exact {{snapshots}} of an entire disk partition. The program can back up a system hard drive while the OS is running. Acronis True Image can browse the contents of <b>backups</b> <b>and</b> <b>restore</b> them partially or entirely. It can also mount a disk backup as a virtual disk, readable {{in the same way}} as any disk drive.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Backup</b> <b>and</b> <b>Restore,</b> {{the backup}} {{component}} of Windows, is deprecated. It still ships with Windows 8 {{and continues to}} work on preset schedules, but is pushed to the background and can only be accessed through a Control Panel applet called [...] "Windows 7 File Recovery". Shadow Copy, a component of Windows Explorer that once saved previous versions of changed files, no longer protects local files and folders. It can only access previous versions of shared files stored on a Windows Server computer. The subsystem on which these components worked, however, is still available for other software to use.|$|E
2500|$|ZFS also {{includes}} a mechanism for snapshots and replication, including snapshot cloning; the former is described by the FreeBSD documentation {{as one of its}} [...] "most powerful features", having features that [...] "even other file systems with snapshot functionality lack". Very large numbers of snapshots can be taken, without degrading performance, allowing snapshots to be used prior to risky system operations and software changes, or an entire production ("live") file system to be fully snapshotted several times an hour, in order to mitigate data loss due to user error or malicious activity. Snapshots can be rolled back [...] "live" [...] or the file system at previous points in time viewed, even on very large file systems, leading to [...] "tremendous" [...] savings in comparison to formal <b>backup</b> <b>and</b> <b>restore</b> processes, or cloned [...] "on the spot" [...] to form new independent file systems.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2017 a GIF {{library was}} {{added in the}} compose bar, as well as easier one-tap access to the Google Assistant, and {{animated}} emoji. Also in March was an update that let Android users send various types of files, including PDFs, documents, APKs, ZIP archives, and MP3 tracks through Allo. In May, the app was updated to allow users to <b>backup</b> <b>and</b> <b>restore</b> chats, added an Incognito mode for group chats, and introduced previews for links. Later the same month, Fast Company reported that Google updated Allo to add cartoon stickers on selfie photos, powered by artificial intelligence technology capable of producing [...] "563 quadrillion face" [...] animations. Complementing selfie stickers, Google also launched [...] "selfie clips", short looped videos of the user's face. In June, {{the ability to make}} Google Duo video or audio calls directly from Allo chats was included. The following month saw message reactions being added, where users can tap on a heart below messages received. An in-chat translation feature appeared to some users in version 17 and rolled out to all in version 18, the latter of which was released in September.|$|E
5000|$|IBM Virtualization Engine TS7700 series - The TS7700 is {{a virtual}} tape library for System z (mainframe) that uses disk drives for cache to {{accelerate}} backup operations. The design is intended to protect data while having shorter backup windows. End-to-end encryption protects data in motion, on cache hard drives and on tape. TS7740 and TS7720 are designed to speed up tape <b>backups</b> <b>and</b> <b>restores</b> by using a tiered hierarchy of disk and tape to make more efficient use of tape drives.|$|R

5000|$|The Standard Edition can {{complete}} <b>backup</b> <b>and</b> <b>restoring</b> of disks (including system disks), partitions, files, and folders. It {{provides the}} ability to schedule automated incremental <b>and</b> differential <b>backups.</b> The feature called [...] "universal restore" [...] enables migration of an operating system to physical computers or virtual machines with dissimilar hardware. System <b>and</b> data <b>backups</b> use the Shadow Copy technology, which enables creating backups without interrupting running software. The utility can create a bootable recovery disk based either on Linux or on Windows PE (which supports both BIOS and UEFI).|$|R
2500|$|Windows 7 {{includes}} 13 additional sound schemes, titled Afternoon, Calligraphy, Characters, Cityscape, Delta, Festival, Garden, Heritage, Landscape, Quirky, Raga, Savanna, and Sonata. Internet Spades, Internet Backgammon and Internet Checkers, {{which were}} removed from Windows Vista, were restored in Windows 7. Users are able to disable or customize many more Windows components than was possible in Windows Vista. New additions to this list of components include Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media Player 12, Windows Media Center, Windows Search, and Windows Gadget Platform. A new version of Microsoft Virtual PC, newly renamed as Windows Virtual PC was made available for Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate editions. It allows multiple Windows environments, including Windows XP Mode, to run on the same machine. Windows XP Mode runs Windows XP in a virtual machine, and displays applications within separate windows on the Windows 7 desktop. Furthermore, Windows 7 supports the mounting of a virtual hard disk (VHD) as a normal data storage, and the bootloader delivered with Windows 7 can boot the Windows system from a VHD; however, this ability is only available in the Enterprise and Ultimate editions. The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) of Windows 7 is also enhanced to support real-time multimedia application including video playback and 3D games, thus allowing use of DirectX 10 in remote desktop environments. The three application limit, previously present in the Windows Vista and Windows XP Starter Editions, {{has been removed from}} Windows 7. All editions include some new and improved features, such as Windows Search, Security features, and some features new to Windows 7, that originated within Vista. Optional BitLocker Drive Encryption is included with Windows 7 Ultimate and Enterprise. Windows Defender is included; Microsoft Security Essentials antivirus software is a free download. All editions include Shadow Copy, which—every day or so—System Restore uses to take an automatic [...] "previous version" [...] snapshot of user files that have changed. <b>Backup</b> <b>and</b> <b>restore</b> have also been improved, and the Windows Recovery Environment—installed by default—replaces the optional Recovery Console of Windows XP.|$|E

"Instant Scan technology"—reduces Source {{scanning}} time on both <b>backups</b> <b>and</b> <b>restores.</b> An optional additional root process, {{running on the}} [...] "backup server" [...] and/or a [...] "Retrospect client", now pre-scans NTFS volumes—by employing the USN Journal—and HFS+ volumes—by employing FSEvents registration—connected to that machine. [...] This enables Retrospect, {{in combination with the}} Media Set's Catalog File, to determine which files have changed since the previous backup. Because the additional root process requires substantial RAM, a user can disable Instant Scan via the Retrospect Preferences on a particular [...] "client". However, from the Console Sources panel detail pane for a particular [...] "client", the administrator can prevent the user from disabling Instant Scan on that [...] "client"—thus choosing backup speed over user RAM conservation.|$|R
