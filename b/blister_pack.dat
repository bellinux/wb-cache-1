50|$|Blister packs are {{a common}} form of packaging. They are safe {{and easy to use}} and the user can see the {{contents}} without opening the pack.

Sometimes the pack may be perforated so that individual tablets can be detached. This means that the expiry date and the drug's name must be printed on each part of the package. The <b>blister</b> <b>pack</b> itself must remain absolutely flat as it travels through the packaging processes, especially when it is inserted into a carton. Extra ribs are added to the <b>blister</b> <b>pack</b> to improve its stiffness.|$|E
