40|$|Abstract. SiCp/A 356 {{composites}} containing 20 % (volume fraction) SiC {{and three}} kinds of different filler metals were investigated by vacuum brazing process. <b>Brazability</b> of SiCp/A 356 composites was analyzed after nickel plating {{on the surface of}} composites and without nickel plating process. The effects of holding time on microstructure of the brazed joints of SiCp/A 356 composite were studied by metallographic microscope, SEM and Energy spectrum analysis. The results show that nickel plating on the surface of composite contribute to improve <b>brazability</b> of SiCp/A 356 composites prominently, while inferior <b>brazability</b> displayed without nickel plating on the surface of composites. Hardness of joints brazed at holding time of 6 min, 8 min and 10 min were studied, consequently the hardness of the weld seam region is the highest when the holding time was 8 min...|$|E
40|$|The Nitrogen/Oxygen Recharge System (NORS) for the International Space Station (ISS) Program was {{required}} {{as part of}} the Space Shuttle retirement efforts to sustain the ISS life support systems. The system is designed around a 7000 psia Oxygen or Nitrogen Recharge Tank Assembly which is able to be utilized both internally and externally to the ISS. Material selection and usage were critical to ensure oxygen compatibility for the design, while taking into consideration toxicity, weldability, <b>brazability</b> and general fabrication and assembly techniques. The system uses unique hardware items such a composite overwrap pressure vessel (COPV), high pressure mechanical gauges, compact regulators and valves, quick disconnects, metal tubing and flexhoses. Numerous challenges and anomalies were encountered due to the exotic nature of this project which will be discussed in detail. The knowledge gained from these anomalies and failure resolutions can be applied to more than space applications, but can also be applicable to industry pressurized systems...|$|E
40|$|For future space applications, it is {{important}} that thermal protection systems be reusable for space shuttle flights. Beryllium offers a unique combination of properties for use as a heat shield material (stiffness, lightweight, ability to absorb heat). In order to adequately test these properties, it was necessary to fabricate heat shields. The concept used was a two-section test panel 99. 1 x 99. 1 cm (39 x 39 inch) with each section made of two 0. 051 cm (0. 020 inch) thick beryllium corrugations brazed together as a mirror image, with titanium (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) used as standoffs to support the panel structure. The work prior to fabrication included <b>brazability</b> of both beryllium and titanium, forming of beryllium and titanium, machining processes involving beryllium and chem-milling beryllium. Sub-scale samples were made of all details before actual fabrication of the large panel. The full scale test panel was hot-formed at 950 K, chem-milled to 0. 041 + or - 0. 005 cm (0. 016 + or - 0. 002 inches), trimmed, vacuum brazed, drilled and assembled...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fast-developing such {{advanced}} industries as aviation, automotive and power-generation {{are increasing}} demand for new engineering materials which could resists such extreme operation conditions as high operating temperature, considerable stresses or operation in fume-affected environment. Highly desirable properties of such materials should include high hardness and strength, corrosion resistance (also {{when exposed to}} aggressive fumes) but also, first of all, low density. However such materials also requirements engineering methods to ensure obtain of good sound joints. Results in growing interest in modern engineering materials characterised by increasingly better operational parameters combined with a necessity to obtain joints of such materials representing good operation properties create important research and technological problems of today. These issues include also titanium joints or joints of titanium alloys based on intermetallic compounds. Brazing {{is one of the}} basic and sometimes even the only available welding method used for joining the aforesaid materials in production of various systems, heat exchangers and, in case of titanium alloys based on intermetallic compounds, turbine elements and space shuttle plating etc. This article presents the basic physical and chemical properties as well as the <b>brazability</b> of alloys based o...|$|E

Structural examination was performed by means of light microscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersion spectrometer (EDS). Furthermore, the article reveals the results of shear strength tests involving the aforementioned joints...|$|E
