60|$|So rapidly did {{the snow}} thaw that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> camp only the shady patches were left.|$|E
60|$|The man tore {{along the}} streets to the Pacific railway station. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> it we had distanced the sightseers, though some of them gave chase. My {{policeman}} got out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Somebody fired a Slem-ray after him, but it missed. The horses {{carried him}} out of the {{building}} and onto the grounds. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the exit the cart was half way to the park." ...|$|E

5000|$|... 2010: <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>We</b> Leave Here, We'll Be Friends - J. David Osborne ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was dark}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> had {{wandered through the}} town and got the letters and found the hotel--so I went to bed.|$|R
60|$|The next instant {{we were on}} the street. Arrests in Darbyville were rare, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> {{the jail}} we had a goodly {{following}} of boys and idle men, all anxious to know what was up.|$|E
60|$|It {{was dark}} enough {{when we started}} to make it no easy matter to find our way across the moors, but as we {{advanced}} it grew lighter and lighter, until <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> Fullarton's cabin it was broad daylight.|$|E
60|$|From Axminster to Combe Regis {{the line}} runs through country as {{attractive}} as any {{that can be}} found in the island, and the train, as if in appreciation of this fact, does not hurry over the journey. It was late afternoon <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> our destination.|$|E
60|$|We went on quickly--so quickly, that Laura was breathless <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> {{were nearly}} through the plantation, and {{within sight of}} the lighted windows.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{never had}} such good luck, darling. Our forefathers were {{in such a}} hurry with them, that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> were born, there was hardly one left.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> {{arrived at}} <b>the</b> {{mouth of the}} river there was no {{necessity}} of discussing the situation, for the chase had surely come to an end.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a {{great deal}} more like Aunt Melissa," [...] answers Frank. [...] "The air felt so raw and chilly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the pier, that she {{declared}} the baby would perish if it was taken to the beach. Besides, nothing would persuade her that Nantasket Beach was at all different from Liverpool Wharf." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{the captain}} had old-fashioned prejudices against antiseptics. He always used {{molasses}} for fresh wound-dressings. I lay in my bunk many weary weeks--we had a long passage--and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> Hong Kong the thing was healed, {{there was no need}} for a shore surgeon, and I was standing my third mate's watch--we carried third mates in those days." ...|$|E
60|$|The descent {{was very}} laborious, {{especially}} through the several miles of bush and rock which lie below the summit: so that, although we started at 10 a.m., {{it was dark}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> Buckeem, where we found two lame coolies, whom we had left on our way up, and who were keeping up a glorious fire for our reception.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's {{where the}} benefit of the bank comes in. There is water enough in 103 NOW, yet there may not be <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> get there; but the bank will keep us posted all along. You don't run close chutes on a falling river, up-stream, and there are {{precious}} few of them that you are allowed to run at all down-stream. There's a law of the United States against it. The river may be rising <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> get to 103, and in that case we'll run it. We are drawing--how much?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Nathan, {{jump on the}} sled, and {{you shall}} have a ride. Rollo and I will be your horses. Mother will have supper ready <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> get home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hope {{they have}} supper ready <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> get there," [...] said Whopper {{after a period}} of silence. [...] "This transit is making me as hungry as a bear." ...|$|R
6000|$|Marble {{took the}} idea, and seemed pleased with it, though he affirmed {{that there could}} be no such thing as acting lawyer without lying a little, and that [...] "the truth was too good for one of your bloody usurers." [...] I got him trained, however, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the door; and we alighted as well {{prepared}} for our task as could be expected.|$|E
60|$|I was abashed; I was humiliated; I was nigh to tears. I choked it all down, and I strode on beside her, my rage {{smouldering}} within me. But it was flaring {{up again}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> {{the house with}} no more words spoken between us. She went to her room without another glance at me, and I repaired straight in quest of Fifanti.|$|E
60|$|I {{was almost}} exhausted, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> camp, just at dark, I was wholly exhausted. My voice had sunk to a whisper, {{a fact that}} occasioned R.C. some concern until I could explain. Undoubtedly this was the hardest day's work I had done since my lion hunting with Buffalo Jones. It did not {{surprise}} me that next day I had to forget my crosscut saw exercise.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll sing {{pretty small}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> are through with you," [...] growled the bully; and then Tom was led below {{and placed in}} the cell with the others.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{next thing}} is to slip ashore at Wapping, Jack," [...] he said, after he had {{finished}} his meal; [...] "the wharâ€™ll be closed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> get there." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We'd {{never done}} a video before, miming and all that. The first take was all right, but <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> were doing <b>the</b> third it was {{difficult}} to be serious." ...|$|R
60|$|The rumour of our coming sped {{through the}} streets ahead of us, {{and out of the}} houses poured the townsfolk to watch our passage and to point me out one to another with many whisperings and solemn head-waggings. And the farther we advanced, the greater was the concourse, until <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the square before the Communal Palace we found there what {{amounted}} to a mob awaiting us.|$|E
60|$|This, however, so retarded our departure, {{that night}} had fallen <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> Blois. Still our journey {{had been a}} passing swift one. We had left Paris on a Monday, the fourth of June--I have good cause to remember, since on that day I entered both upon my thirty-second year and my altered fortunes; {{on the evening of}} Wednesday we reached Blois, having covered a {{distance}} of forty-three leagues in less than three days.|$|E
60|$|Hans, of course, {{was much}} oppressed {{by the great}} weight of the gorilla skin, which, {{although}} it had shrunk a good deal, remained as heavy as ever. But he was a tough old fellow, and on the whole got on better than might have been expected, though <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the town he was sometimes obliged to {{follow the example of}} the god itself and help himself forward with his hands, going on all fours, as a gorilla generally does.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{laid out}} the novel one night to my wife, Kate Novak, while we were driving from Lake Geneva Wisconsin to Milwaukee. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> got there, I had a co-writer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Cuthbert," [...] she said, frankly, [...] "I {{think this}} has all been very silly, and I hope that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> meet again you will have {{forgotten}} all about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> reach <b>the</b> house, {{that black}} rascal {{will have the}} mad Virginian upon us. By my soul I would rather meet fifty Cowboys than that single man." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, I set {{myself to}} {{recovering}} Leo, who, to my infinite relief, I found was not dead, but only fainting, {{and in the}} end I succeeded, as I have said, and he sat up; and then I saw another dreadful thing. When we entered that awful place his curling hair had been of the ruddiest gold, now it was turning grey, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the outer air it was snow white. Besides, he looked twenty years older.|$|E
60|$|About half a {{mile from}} the gates of this kraal is a long stretch of rising ground sloping gently upwards from the road, and here the {{companies}} formed. It was a splendid sight to see them, each company about three hundred strong, charging swiftly up the rise, with flashing spears and waving plumes, to take their appointed place. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the slope twelve such companies, or in all three thousand six hundred men, had passed out and taken up their positions along the road.|$|E
60|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>reached</b> the post-town he had {{accomplished}} this mental effort {{to his own}} perfect satisfaction, and was quite ready to compare the ale at the inn with the ale at Darrock Hall. The dog-cart was left to be taken back the next morning by the hostler. A post-chaise and horses were ordered out. A loaf of bread, a Bologna sausage, and two bottles of sherry were put {{into the pockets of}} the carriage; we took our seats, and started briskly on our doubtful journey.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I!" [...] said Parsley; [...] "and Sourgrass and I {{rode the}} same butterfly; but <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> had come this far, we got too heavy, and Sourgrass made me get off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That don't {{make any}} difference, for it won't delay us. I'm {{going to start}} right out to buy <b>the</b> engine, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> hear from him, we shall be at work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall {{only want}} the three riding mules {{and one for}} baggage. Of course we shall not take JosÃ© or my wife. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> return {{everything}} {{will be ready for}} us." ...|$|R
