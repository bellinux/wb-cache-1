5|$|At the Grey Cup level, the Argonauts {{have faced}} an {{assortment}} of teams in recent decades rather than any one team regularly. The Edmonton Eskimos, for years a dominant team in the league, became a rival. The two teams' five Grey Cup match-ups include an epic 38–36 Toronto loss in 1987 and most recently, the Snow Bowl victory in 1996 led <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> of Doug Flutie. In the pre-CFL days, the Argos had a Grey Cup rivalry with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and a cross-town rivalry with the University of Toronto {{in the first years}} of the Grey Cup championship, including the Argonauts' first win in 1914.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to find the {{equalising}} goal, United manager Alex Ferguson moved Giggs from the centre of midfield to the left in order to restore the width of his team and brought on striker Dwight Yorke for Butt. Yorke would spearhead the attack with Van Nistelrooy, a partnership that worked on the club's pre-season tour of Asia. United had another chance in the 68th minute, but Scholes was unable to beat Westerveld, who saved his shot. Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier made his first substitutions of the match soon after; in an attempt to regain control of possession, he brought on Igor Bišćan and Patrik Berger to replace Barmby and Murphy. Liverpool's first chance of the half came in the 81st minute, Bišćan and Owen exchanged passes, before Bišćan shot wide of the goal. United went straight on the attack and a goal-bound shot by Keane was saved by Westerveld. Liverpool replaced Riise with defender Jamie Carragher minutes later in order to see out the game. A minute later, referee D'Urso declined to award United a penalty for the second time when Van Nistelrooy's shot appeared to be blocked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> of Henchoz. United continued to push forward for an equaliser, but a long-range shot by Irwin, which went wide, was their only notable chance before the match ended. Liverpool won 2–1 to win the Shield for the 14th time.|$|E

25|$|England won the toss {{and decided}} to bat first. Lawson gave the {{tourists}} an early breakthrough by clean-bowling Graham Gooch for 11. Tim Robinson, who {{had come into the}} side at number three, was out LBW bowled Lawson a few overs later, with England not having added to the score. Curtis again fell cheaply, clean bowled by Lawson for 22 and leaving England struggling at 57 for 3. Captain David Gower and the returning South African born Robin Smith worked to restore the innings with a diligent partnership of 75 for fourth wicket, but Gower was undone <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> ball of off-spinner Trevor Hohns which struck him in front, and he was given out LBW for a well made 35. That bought champion batsman Ian Botham to the wicket, but he was out for a duck two overs later, bowled by Hohns. Jack Russell was trapped in front for 1 by Lawson a few overs later, and England's innings was disintegrating at 147 for 6. Emburey batted defensively to support Robin Smith, taking 34 balls to make his 5, but he too was eventually deceived by Hohns, out LBW. Some stubborn resistance by Neil Foster late in the day allowed Smith to bring up his century, and saw England finish the day on 224 for 7, Foster not out on 35 and Smith on 112.|$|E

500|$|The {{match between}} The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) had little background, {{although}} Afa, who managed The Headshrinkers, claimed {{that his team}} would [...] "tear [...] heads off". Doink the Clown and Crush had been feuding since the January 2, 1993, episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling. After Crush's match on that show, he confronted Doink, who had thrown a ball at {{a child in the}} audience. Crush grabbed Doink <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> and warned him not to play any more pranks on children. Doink, wearing a cast on the arm that Crush had supposedly injured by grabbing, came to ringside during Crush's match on the January 18 episode of WWF Monday Night Raw. He apologized to Crush and gave him a flower; when Crush walked away, Doink removed a prosthetic arm from his cast and attacked Crush, who was later taken away in an ambulance due to kayfabe (storyline) injuries. For storyline purposes, Crush was said to be too injured to compete in the 1993 Royal Rumble match. Doink continued his pranks by squirting Crush with a water pistol and recording video messages to Crush, which showed two Doinks on the screen.|$|E

He persuades her to smile to avoid embarrassment from the guests then verbally abuses her and grabs her face, after which she leaves to the restroom, where she wipes away a tear and puts on her fragrance Radiance. She comes back to the party and catches her boyfriend flirting with another woman; Spears tells her [...] "So you're not working the street corner tonight I see?", making her boyfriend angry. He apologizes to the other woman for his girlfriend's remark then grabs Spears <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> and carries her outside the building. After he slaps her, one of the waiters of the party (Trawick) wearing a leather jacket punches her boyfriend several times. The waiter asks Spears if she is okay, and after she kicks her boyfriend in the crotch goodbye, she replies [...] "Now I'm okay." [...] She and the waiter climb on his motorcycle and leave the scene. When they get to his house, it is revealed by a newspaper that he is a criminal. She opens one of the lockers in his house and finds a gun, after which the couple kisses.
