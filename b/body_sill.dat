40|$|Magma/wet {{sediment}} interaction (e. g. autobrecciation, magma-sediment mingling, hyaloclastite and peperite-forming, etc.) is {{a common}} phenomenon, where hot magma intrudes into unconsolidated or poorly consolidated water saturated sediment. In the Eastern Borsod Basin (NE-Hungary) relatively small (2 – 30 m) subvolcanic <b>bodies,</b> <b>sills</b> and dykes with contact lithofacies zones were found generated by mechanical stress and quenching of the magma, and interacting with unconsolidated wet andesitic lapilli-tuff and tuff-breccia. Close to the contact between sediment and intrusions, thermal and mechanical effects may occur in the host sediment. Hydrothermal alteration and stratification of the host sediment were developed only locally along the contact zone, {{probably due to the}} paleo-hydrogeologic and paleo-rheological inhomogeneities of the lapilli-tuff–tuff-breccia deposits. Processes of magma/wet sediment interaction may be difficult to recognize because of limited exposure and/or certain similarities of the brecciated intrusions to the characteristics of the host sediment; hence detailed field work (geologic mapping or profiling) was required to demonstrate the subvolcanic origin of the brecciated andesite bodies...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Basic, doleritic sills form a key {{component}} of subvolcanic complexes in the prospective parts of volcanic margins where they add considerably to the structural and thermal complexity of the subsurface geology. Whilst recent 3 D seismic studies of sill complexes in volcanic margins have added considerable new insights into their development and significance, field studies at the sub- and trans-seismic scale are still required. The Theron Mountains in Antarctica offer perhaps the best exposures of a dolerite sill complex to be seen anywhere in the world and they create an unprecedented opportunity to understand the processes, on a variety of scales, that are important in individual sill emplacement. Large- and small-scale evidence indicates that forceful roof uplift is the fundamental emplace-ment mechanism. The sills contain an abundance of ‘bridge structures’, which are the remains of country rock that once lay between thin and closely separated precursor sills. Viewed on a variety of scales and inferred to be preserved at different stages in their development, these indicate that small proto-sills propagate ahead of the main <b>sill</b> <b>body,</b> exploiting thin weak horizons, such as coal and shale. The proto-sills expand laterally as they move downstream and come to overlap vertically along their lateral margins. Country rock bridges form between the sill overlaps and are rotated, bent and eventually broken as magma flow creates vertical inflation. Thus, a network of proto-sills exploiting a variety of weak horizontal horizons ahead of the main <b>sill</b> <b>body</b> unite, inflate and progressively allow the main <b>sill</b> <b>body</b> to move downstream. Although most thick sills are probably created by many thin proto-sills merging, some sills and some parts of sills are produced by the merging and inflation of single pairs of proto-sills and, in these examples, vertical inflation may run to more than 1000 % of their original vertical separations...|$|R
5000|$|A {{facelift}} {{was carried}} out for the 1970 model year (beginning in September 1969) after Austin-Healey (and MG) became part of British Leyland. These largely cosmetic revision were to update {{the appearance of the}} car (now 10 years old) and minimise the difference between the Sprite and Midget versions to reduce production costs; both cars now had the same cosmetic features, differing only in their badges. Alongside a new range of body colours, both cars now had the same grille, based on the plainer square-mesh design of the MkII-onwards Sprite but now finished in satin black {{with the addition of a}} chrome embelisher. The <b>body</b> <b>sills</b> were painted satin black with a chrome strip between them and the upper bodywork and the name 'SPRITE' was applied in chrome captial letters on the sill just behind the front wheelarch (MG Midgets had their own badge in the same style). Slimmer bumpers were fitted, with those at the rear changing to two quarter-bumpers with the gap in the middle filled by a square number plate. Rubber-capped overriders were standard fitments front and rear. The seats were now a slimmer, flatter design with a more modern upholstery pattern. Some body colours could now be ordered with the option of the seats, door trim and floor carpets in beige rather than the standard black. 1970-model year Sprites were fitted with new cast-alloy ventilated wheels, although the option for wire-spoke wheels remained. As launched the 1970 Sprites had their windscreen frames and windscreen wiper arms painted 'anti-dazzle' matt black as was popular on modern American muscle cars and rally cars of the era but these features were expensive to produce and unpopular with buyers so only a few hundred cars were produced before these reverted to the original polished metal appearance. [...] 22,790 Mark IV Sprites were made.|$|R
50|$|The 1960 Cadillacs had smoother, more {{restrained}} styling. General changes {{included a}} full-width grille, {{the elimination of}} pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint {{in the application of}} chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. External variations on the Seville two-door hardtop and Biarritz convertible took the form of bright <b>body</b> <b>sill</b> highlights that extended across the lower edge of fender skirts and Eldorado lettering {{on the sides of the}} front fenders, just behind the headlamps. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows, six-way power seats, heater, fog lamps, Eldorado engine, remote control trunk lock, radio with antenna and rear speaker, power vent windows, air suspension, electric door locks, license frames, and five whitewall tires. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Chadwick cloth or optional Cambray cloth and leather combinations. The last Eldorado Seville was built in 1960.|$|E
5000|$|The 1959 Cadillac {{is remembered}} for its huge sharp tailfins with dual bullet tail lights, two {{distinctive}} rooflines and roof pillar configurations, new jewel-like grille patterns and matching deck lid beauty panels. In 1959 the Series 62 became the Series 6200. De Villes and 2-door Eldorados were {{moved from the}} Series 62 to their own series, the Series 6300 and Series 6400 respectively, though they all, including the 4-door Eldorado Brougham (which was moved from the Series 70 to Series 6900), shared the same 130 in wheelbase. New mechanical items were a [...] "scientifically engineered" [...] drainage system and new shock absorbers. All Eldorados were characterized by a three-deck, jeweled, rear grille insert, but other trim and equipment features varied. The Seville and Biarritz models had the Eldorado name spelled out behind the front wheel opening and featured broad, full-length <b>body</b> <b>sill</b> highlights that curved over the rear fender profile and back along the upper beltline region. Engine output was an even 345 hp (257 kW) from the 390 cuin L engine. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows, six way power seats, heater, fog lamps, remote control deck lid, radio and antenna with rear speaker, power vent windows, air suspension, electric door locks and license frames. The Eldorado Brougham also came with Air conditioning, automatic headlight dimmer, acruise control standard over the Seville and Biarritz trim lines.|$|E
5000|$|A {{different}} Eldorado Brougham {{was sold}} for 1959 and 1960. These cars were {{not quite so}} extravagantly styled but were very unusual pieces in themselves. Priced at $13,075, they cost $1 more, each, than their older siblings. The company contracted out the assembly to Pininfarina of Italy, with whom the division has had a long-running relationship, and these Eldorados were essentially hand-built in Italy. Ironically only now did it acquire Fleetwood wheel discs and doorsill moldings, presumably because the design work and final touches were still being done by Fleetwood. Discreet, narrow taillights integrated into modest tailfins, and a squared-off rear roof line with rear ventiplanes caused the Italian-built Brougham to contrast sharply to the rounded roof lines, and especially the new [...] "rocketship" [...] taillights and flamboyant fins of the standard 1959 Cadillacs, which are a feature only of that year. A vertical crest medallion with Brougham script plate appeared on the front fenders and a single, thin molding ran from the front to rear along the mid-sides of the body. It did not sport Eldorado front fender letters or <b>body</b> <b>sill</b> headlights. A fin-like crest, or [...] "skeg," [...] ran from behind the front wheel opening {{to the rear of}} the car on the lower bodysides and there were special crest medallions on the trailing edge of the rear fenders. The Brougham's styling cues would prove to indicate where standard Cadillac styling would head from 1960 through the early-mid-1960s. The standard equipment list was pared down to match those of other Eldorados, plus Cruise Control, Autronic Eye, air conditioning and E-Z Eye glass. The Brougham build-quality was not nearly to the standard of the Detroit hand-built 1957-1958 models, and thus the 1959-1960 Broughams did not sell as well as their forebears. However, collector interest and values for these cars remain high. The Eldorado Brougham was moved to its own unique Series 6900 for its remaining two years.|$|E
5000|$|For 1958, {{there was}} a new grille {{featuring}} multiple round [...] "cleats" [...] at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical members. The grille insert was wider and new bumper guards were positioned lower to the parking lamps. New dual headlamps were used and small chrome fins decorated the front fenders. Tailfins were less pronounced and trim attachments were revised. The word Cadillac appeared in block letters on the fins of base models. On the sides of the car were five longer horizontal wind splits ahead of the unskirted rear wheel housing and front fender horizontal mouldings with crests placed above the trailing edge and no rocker sill trim. The convertible and the De Villes used solid metal trim on {{the lower half of the}} conical projection flares, while other models had a thin ridge molding in the same location. On Series 62 Eldorados, a V-shaped ornament and model identification script were mounted to the deck lid. Series 62 Eldorados also had ten vertical chevron slashes ahead of the open rear wheel housings and crest medallions on the flank of the tailfins. Broad, sculptured beauty panels decorated the lower rear quarters on all Series 62 Eldorados and extended around the wheel opening to stretch along the <b>body</b> <b>sills.</b> Standard equipment on all Series 62s was the same as the previous year. All new was an extended deck Series 62 sedan which, along with the Series 62 Sedan deVille, stretched 8.5 inches longer than the regular 4-door Series 62, and a special order Series 62 Eldorado Seville of which only one was actually built. Excluding export sedans and chassis only, the Series 62 offered an all-time record of nine bodystyles this year. The infamous Cadillac Air-Suspension was optional. The following year De Ville and Eldorado were spun off onto their own series.|$|R

40|$|The Palisades Sill {{contains}} an olivine-rich zone that has attracted scientific attention for {{over one hundred}} years. Despite the amount of focus, a definitive explanation for {{the origin of this}} layer has not been reached. Through the use of detailed petrographic analyses and electron microscopy, the aim {{of this study was to}} collect data on mineral phases from the Palisades Sill in order to better understand the history.

5000|$|The DOT-111 tank {{cars are}} {{constructed}} with a draft sill design. Draft sills incorporate the draft gear behind each coupler {{that is designed}} to transfer longitudinal draft (tension) and buff (compression) forces throughout the length of a train. The draft sills are attached to steel pads that are attached to the tank. If the cars do not incorporate a continuous center sill extending {{the entire length of the}} car, the two draft sills at each end are referred to as stub sills, and the tank carries draft forces between couplers. In this case, reinforcing bars may be extended underneath the tank between the draft <b>sills.</b> <b>Body</b> bolsters and their associated body bolster pads centered above the railcar trucks support the tank and protect it against lateral forces.

40|$|International audienceThe Mt. Emilius klippe (Western Alps, Italy) {{corresponds}} to {{a segment of the}} stretched Adriatic continental margin metamorphosed in granulite-facies during Permian. This slice was subducted during the early Cenozoic Alpine subduction with the underlying eclogite-facies remnants of the Tethyan seafloor (Zermatt-Saas zone). Near the base of the Mt. Emilius massif, a shear zone presents eclogite-facies hydrofracture systems associated with deformation-induced re-equilibration of granulites during high pressure metamorphism. We herein focus on a pluri-hectometer-length domain of sheared mafic boudins hosted in the granulitic paragneiss. These mafic boudins exhibit garnetites and garnet veins, clinopyroxenites, clinozoisite and calcite veins. We report multiple events of fracture opening, brecciation, boudinage and parallelization of structures coevally with fluid-rock interaction, metasomatism and volume change. Our integrated petrological, micro-textural and geochemical investigations illustrate the multiplicity and the chemical variability of fluid sources during prograde to peak metamorphic evolution in the lawsonite-eclogite-facies field (at ~ 2. 15 - 2. 4 GPa, 500 - 550 °C). The calcite veins crosscutting the garnetites have relatively low δ 18 OVSMOW values (c. + 6. 5 per mil) near those for marble layers (and nearby calc-silicates) embedded within the metasomatized granulites (+ 8 to + 10 per mil). It is proposed that infiltration of externally-derived H 2 O-rich fluids derived from the plate interface flushed the marbles, promoting decarbonation followed by short-distance transport and re-precipitation along garnetite fractures. This study highlights the importance of inherited structural heterogeneities (such as mafic <b>bodies</b> or <b>sills)</b> in localizing deformation, draining fluids from the downgoing plate, and creating long-lasting mechanical instabilities during subduction zone deformation...|$|R
40|$|Detailed sedimentological {{investigations}} {{on numerous}} outcrops and drill-core sections in the 2. 1 -Ga-old Franceville basin, Gabon, {{provide evidence for}} a large-scale injectite network. The injectites were formed by the injection of sands through a thickness of about 150 m of the FB 1 Member, and now cover a minimum area of 70 km 2 corresponding to the Bangombé plateau, but are also recognized close to Franceville 35 km farther south-east. The injectite lithology corresponds to a mud- or carbonate-supported sandstone characterized by a loose and uncompacted fabric contrasting with the host-rock. Because the injectites are often parallel to subparallel to the stratification, they were misinterpreted as depositional beds by previous authors. At outcrop, the injectite <b>bodies</b> exhibit <b>sill,</b> dyke, wing and protrusive geometries emplaced during early burial within poorly compacted material, with partial wall erosion and dissociation. The source of the sand material is attributed to a channel-levee turbidite depositional system located in {{the lower part of}} the FB 1 Member. These deposits were buried by a thick biochemical muddy cap deposited during a starvation phase, which increased the seal capacity of the system. This type of architecture has a high potential to develop compaction disequilibrium during burial. Moreover, in the case of the Francevillian injectites, the abundance of microbial organic matter favoured early methane degassing and lateral charging of the sand reservoir. The overpressure in the channels was periodically released during early burial, through the effect of rapid sedimentary and tectonic loading, and possible seismic activity. The fluidized sand was injected according to a symmetrical wing pattern. Thus, the injected masses caused a local decrease in the grade of the lateritic manganese ore deposit of the Bangombé plateau...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} geology and metamorphic petrology of the Bosost {{area in the}} Valle de Arán (Central Pyrenees) is discussed. The rocks {{exposed in}} this area consist of Cambro-Ordovician mica-schists with numerous granite and pegmatite bodies, phyllites and limestones; Silurian slates and schists and Devonian schists and limestones. The major structure dating from the Hercynian orogeny is the Garonne dome with essentially horizontal schistosity. Large steep folds in the Devonian accompanied by axial plane slaty cleavage are folded disharmonically {{with regard to the}} Cambro-Ordovician. Both kinds of structures date from the main phase. A second and later phase with N-S foldaxes was accompanied by laminar flow in E-W direction as shown by numerous rotated porphyroblasts. A third and fourth phase of deformation have folds with vertical axial planes in NW-SE and E-W direction. These last three phases are characterized by minor and microfolds only. The method of investigating microstructures mainly with regard to porphyroblasts is discussed first; then its application. This resulted in the establishment of four metamorphic zones: a biotite-zone; a staurolite-andalusite-cordierite-zone; an andalusite-cordierite-zone and a cordierite-sillimanite-zone; in this order with increasing grade. The higher zones have passed through each of the lower grade ones, so that the cordierite-sillimanite-zone has the most complex history. Staurolite is the first aluminium-silicate to crystallize with increasing temperature, than andalusite, cordierite and finally sillimanite. Before sillimanite started to form, staurolite was already unstable; at the beginning of sillimanite crystallization andalusite became unstable. Cale-silicate rocks in the Ordovician limestone in the cordierite-sillimanite-zone contain bytownite, grossularite, diopside and vesuvianite. Granite and pegmatite <b>bodies</b> and <b>sills</b> occur in all the aluminium-silicate bearing zones, but most abundant in the cordierite-sillimanite-zone. Their emplacement lasted from shortly after the first phase until after the fourth. The culminating point lies around the fourth phase. The granites are mainly composed of albite, quartz, and muscovite; the pegmatites carry smaller or larger amounts of microcline. Chemical analyses of phyllites and mica-schists have shown that the composition of both rock groups is essentially the same. With increasing silicium content, aluminium and potassium decrease. The granites have high alcali percentages with sodium predominating over potassium...|$|R
50|$|Tharsis is {{commonly}} called a volcano-tectonic province, {{meaning that it}} is the product of volcanism and associated tectonic processes that have caused extensive crustal deformation. According to the standard view, Tharsis overlies a hot spot, similar to the one thought to underlie the island of Hawaii. The hot spot is caused by one or more massive columns of hot, low-density material (a superplume) rising through the mantle. The hot spot produces voluminous quantities of magma in the lower crust that is released to the surface as highly fluid, basaltic lava. Because Mars lacks plate tectonics, the lava is able to build up in one region for billions of years to produce enormous volcanic constructs.On Earth (and presumably Mars as well), not all of the magma produced in a large igneous province erupts at the surface as lava. Much of it stalls in the crust where it slowly cools and solidifies to produce large intrusive complexes (plutons). If the magma migrates through vertical fractures it produces swarms of dikes that may be expressed at the surface as long, linear cracks (fossae) and crater chains (catenae). Magma may also intrude the crust horizontally as large tabular <b>bodies,</b> such as <b>sills</b> and laccoliths, that can cause a general doming and fracturing of the overlying crust. Thus, the bulk of Tharsis is probably made of these intrusive complexes in addition to lava flows at the surface.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{compositional}} {{homogeneity of}} silicic andesites emitted during the 13, 500 -year-long last eruptive cycle of Mount Pelee {{suggests that the}} physical state of the magma chamber was largely unmodified during this period. Experimental phase equilibria on Mount Pelee recent products indicate that pre-eruptive magma temperatures and pressures were {{in the range of}} 875 – 900 °C and 2 ± 0. 5 kbar, respectively. The estimated average eruption rate was 7. 5 × 10 − 4 km 3 /a with an average volume of about 0. 3 km 3 per eruption. An analytical model for a spherical magma chamber indicates that a magma flux of 4 – 5 × 10 − 4 km 3 /a can maintain a magma chamber of 0. 3 km 3 above 875 °C below Mount Pelee. However, observations of plutons suggest that magma chambers may grow by addition of sheet-like intrusions. With numerical simulation we show that a minimum sheet accretion rate of a few centimeters per year is required to grow a persistently active magma chamber independently of the intruded volumetric flux. This minimum injection rate is higher if the heat transfer is enhanced by convection processes. The limited ability of an arc crust to extend and accommodate dikes suggests that magma injections are sills or, if they are dikes, that most of the volume injected in the magma chamber is eventually erupted. In a conductively cooling igneous <b>body</b> formed by <b>sills</b> injected at a rate of a few centimeters per year, most of the injected magma completely solidifies and {{only a small part of}} the body (about 10 – 20 %) is above 875 °C and able to feed eruptions...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that intrusive magmatic <b>bodies</b> such as <b>sills</b> and dikes {{can influence the}} migration of fluids in the deep subsurface. This influence {{is largely due to}} permeability contrasts with surrounding sedimentary rocks or because of interconnected open fractures within and around intrusions acting as conduits for migrating fluids. The role of buried volcanoes in influencing crossstratal fluid migration in sedimentary basins is less well-established. However, several studies have highlighted spatial linkages between extinct hydrothermal vent complexes and fluid seepage, suggesting that buried extrusive features can also influence subsurface fluid-flow pathways, potentially leading to migration of hydrocarbon fluids between the source and reservoir. We have developed 3 D seismic reflection data from the Bass Basin in offshore southeastern Australia that image an early Miocene volcanic complex with exceptional clarity. This volcanic complex is now buried by < 1. 3 km of younger sediments. The largest volcano within this complex is directly overlain by a vertical feature interpreted to be a fluid escape pipe, which extends vertically for approximately 700 m across the late Miocene-Pliocene succession. We suggest that the buried volcanic complex was able to focus vertical fluid migration {{to the base of the}} pipe because its bulk permeability was higher than that of the overlying claystone sequence. The fluid escape pipe may have initiated through either (1) hydraulic fracturing following fluid expulsion from a deep, overpressured subvolcanic source region, (2) differential compaction and doming of the overlying claystones, or (3) a combination of these processes. Our results suggest a hitherto unrecognized role for buried volcanoes in influencing dynamic subsurface processes in sedimentary basins. In particular, our study highlights that buried volcanoes may facilitate cross-stratal migration of hydrocarbons from source to reservoir, or through sealing horizons. Simon P.

40|$|A major {{intrusive}} sandstone {{complex of}} Late Jurassic age is spectacularly exposed in Jameson land, East Greenland. It {{is probably the}} largest in the World, and covers an area of 55 x 70 km with a thickness of 200 – 400 m, and forms the Upper Oxfordian–Volgian Hareelv Formation. The complex consists of black basinal mudstones and highly irregular sandstone <b>bodies,</b> dykes and <b>sills.</b> The sand was derived from collapse of the front of sandy shelf-margin wedges, which triggered hyperconcentrated to concentrated density flows, and deposited massive sands further down the slope, at the base-of-slope and in the basin. The sand of some flows was loaded into the slope muds while elsewhere it flowed in steep-sided gullies formed by retrogressive slumping of the slope muds. All sand bodies were liquefied subsequent to burial and the sand was intruded into the surrounding black compacted muds and mudstones. Intrusion took place repeatedly over a long time interval, in environments ranging from very shallow to relatively deep burial, and the primary sediment structures of the sands were generally lost during these processes. It is rarely possible to determine the degree of post-burial remobilization but it ranges from rather small-scale modifications to wholesale liquefaction and out-of-place intrusion of the sand over many tens of metres. Sandstone dykes and sills occur ubiquitously and were emplaced by all combinations of stoping and dilation. The intrusive sand bodies range in dimensions from centimetres to many hundreds of metres. Deposition took place during the most important Mesozoic rift event in East Greenland and the pervasive remobilization and liquefaction of all sand bodies in the Hareelv Formation is interpreted as having been caused mainly by cyclic earthquake shocks. Additional important factors were slope shear stress, build up of pore pressure due to loading, slumping, upwards movement of pore waters expelled from the compacting muds, and also possibly of biogenic and thermogenic gas. The Hareelv Formation is an excellent field analogue for deeply buried hydrocarbon reservoirs, which have been modified by remobilization and injection of the sands...|$|R
40|$|Chibuluma Mine is {{situated}} on the southern flank of the Nkana-Chambishi basin in the central section of the Zambian Copperbelt. The amphibolite at Chibuluma Mine occurs exclusively in the Upper Roan Group sediments overlying the economically important Lower Roan Group. The amphibolite occurs in lenticular, sill-like bodies ranging in thickness from less than 10 feet to over 1, 000 feet. It is concluded that these sill-like <b>bodies</b> are intrusive <b>sills</b> of basic magma. The largest sill is a multiple intrusion with two phases, both of which exhibit chilled margins. The younger phase was intruded into the older along a plane approximately 50 feet above its basal contact. Grainsize, specific gravity, and micrometric data indicate that each phase of the intrusion has undergone gravitational differentiation during crystallisation. Variations in the relative amounts of amphibole and feldspar distinguish between a lower melanocratic amphibolite, an upper mesotype amphibolite, and a zone of coarse-grained pegmatitic amphibolite schlieren. The amphibolite consists mainly of hornblende, labradorite, albite, and scapolite, with accessory biotite, chlorite, epidote, clinozoisite, sphene, apatite, quartz, micropegmatite, and calcite. Clouding of the basic plagioclase and zoning in amphibole, plagioclase, and scapolite are features of petrological significance. The opaque minerals in the amphibolites and the adjacent sediments are magnetite, ilmenite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, cubanite, valleriite, and pentlandite. Intergrowths of these suggest that their temperatures of formation were probably in excess of 450 °C. The chemical data show a close resemblance between the amphibolite and a tholeiitic magma-type although minor spilitic characteristics are also evident. The chemical data also confirm the mineralogical evidence of fractionation and gravitational differentiation. The trend in differentiation followed {{in the development of}} the pegmatitic and mesotype amphibolite is very similar to the trends followed by other basic intrusions. The main metamorphic affect accompanying the intrusion of the amphibolite is the soda metasomatism evident in both sediments and intrusions. Some evidence exists to suggest that the amphibolites were emplaced before or during the early stages of the Lufilian orogeny when sediments were essentially horizontal...|$|R
