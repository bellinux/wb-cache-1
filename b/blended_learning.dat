5000|$|<b>Blended</b> <b>learning</b> {{also have}} the {{potential}} to reduce educational expenses, although some dispute that <b>blended</b> <b>learning</b> is inherently less expensive than traditional classroom learning. <b>Blended</b> <b>learning</b> can lower costs by putting classrooms in the online space and it essentially replaces pricey textbooks with electronic devices that students often bring themselves to class. E-textbooks, which can be accessed digitally, may also help to drive down textbook budgets. Proponents of <b>blended</b> <b>learning</b> cite the opportunity for data collection and customization of instruction and assessment as two major benefits of this approach. <b>Blended</b> <b>learning</b> often includes software that automatically collects student data and measures academic progress, providing teachers, students and parents detailed students data. Often, tests are automatically scored, providing instantaneous feedback. Student logins and work times are also measured to ensure accountability. Schools with <b>blended</b> <b>learning</b> programs may also choose to reallocate resources to boost student achievement outcomes. Students with special talents or interests outside of the available curricula use educational technology to advance their skills or exceed grade restrictions. <b>Blended</b> <b>learning</b> allows for personalized education, replacing the model where a teacher {{stands in front of the}} classroom and everyone is expected to stay at the same pace. [...] "Blended learning allows students to work at their own pace, making sure they fully understand new concepts before moving on." [...] A classroom environment that incorporates <b>blended</b> <b>learning</b> naturally requires learners to demonstrate more autonomy, self-regulation, and independence in order to succeed. If teachers offer a form of initial program orientation before introducing <b>blended</b> <b>learning</b> strategies, it can better prepare students to feel confident navigating the different components and developing a stronger sense of independence.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} implementation of a strategic institutional project at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in the area of eLearning, and the qualitative evaluation of this project’s model as an approach for <b>blended</b> (e) <b>Learning</b> institutional change. The project was entitled, “ 3 C: A strategic approach to enabling, integrating and enhancing <b>blended</b> (e) <b>Learning</b> within an institutional framework”, and the model used was three concurrent foci of collaboration, community and context (3 C’s). This study used a qualitative practitioner / researcher case study approach to evaluate the 3 C model, utilizing data drawn from interviews conducted at the completion of the project with a group of 16 eLearning Advocates (eLAs). The interviews with the eLAs were chosen to be the focus of this research as they had the most consistent and lived experience of the 3 C model (as implemented via the project deliverables across 2 years). The key research question being: “What are the qualitatively different ways the eLearning Advocates perceive the 3 C model as an approach for <b>blended</b> (e) <b>Learning</b> institutional change”? These differences in perception identified as a lens through which to evaluate the 3 C model. The eLA interviews provided situational vignettes through which the practitioner / researcher explored the rich sources of data and feedback on the 3 C model. These vignettes were categorized within a narrative around three factors related to <b>blended</b> (e) <b>Learning</b> institutional change. These factors were: considerations of broad structural aspects (Renovation), feedback on specific aspects of the 3 C project (Revolution) and the unexpected factors that had not been considered as part of the project (Revelation).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} seven <b>blended</b> synchronous <b>learning</b> {{designs and}} articulates principles for implementation as espoused {{by the teachers}} who enacted them. <b>Blended</b> synchronous <b>learning</b> approaches use media-rich synchronous technologies to enable remote and face-to-face students to co-participate in the same live classes. A wide range of technologies (video conferencing, web conferencing, virtual worlds), tasks (collaborative evaluation, group questioning, class discussion, problem solving, collaborative design) and levels of student interaction (from lightweight to tightly coupled) were present within the <b>blended</b> synchronous <b>learning</b> designs. The main issues that teachers confronted when teaching blended synchronous lessons were communication issues and issues related to cognitive overload caused by split attention. Key pedagogical principles for enactment as identified by the lead teachers included the need for extensive preparation, clear instructions, composure, flexibility, advance preparation of students and savvy utilisation of support staff.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} {{study was to explore}} the use of information communication technology (ICT) to support leadership development in the New Zealand early childhood education (ECE) sector. There is currently a lack of policy and provision supporting leadership development in this sector. Previous research has identified the value of leadership development programmes that encourage reflective practice, peer collaboration, and a focus on problemsolving in reallife situations. ICT has the potential to support leadership learning using action learning, a process that involves groups of learners working on issues or problems that they face in their professional contexts with the support of a facilitator. Although action learning groups most often meet facetoface, ICT is increasingly being used to support or in some cases replace traditional meetings. This research study, which took the form of interpretive case research, involved the establishment of two <b>blended</b> action <b>learning</b> groups facilitated by the researcher. The participants in this study both met facetoface in facilitated workshops and interacted online while back at their respective workplaces for ongoing reflection, discussion and the sharing of knowledge and resources. The open source software Moodle was the enabling technology used in this study and the ICTs employed included email, online reflective journals, forum discussions and chat sessions. A model of leadership learning using ICT was developed through the analysis of data from this study. This model illustrates the leadership journeys taken by participants who increased their awareness of leadership through a process of recognising, reflecting, realising and responding. This led to increased confidence in their leadership practice and in some cases resulted in a greater distribution of leadership. Four key factors contributing to the leadership learning process were identified to be the <b>blended</b> action <b>learning</b> process, the <b>blended</b> action <b>learning</b> groups, the ICT tools used {{and the role of the}} <b>blended</b> action <b>learning</b> facilitator who acted as both an enabler of learning and a trusted inquisitor.
