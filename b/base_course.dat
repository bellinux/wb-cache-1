5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load-bearing capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the <b>base</b> <b>course</b> material.|$|E
5|$|Had Flight 19 {{actually}} been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight {{would have made}} landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where it should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief {{that he was on}} a <b>base</b> <b>course</b> toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in the area to fly a heading of 270° west (or in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed to stay afloat.|$|E

25|$|A {{road surface}} or {{pavement}} is the durable surface material laid down on an area intended to sustain vehicular or foot traffic, {{such as a}} road or walkway. In the past, gravel road surfaces, cobblestone and granite setts were extensively used, but these surfaces have mostly been replaced by asphalt or concrete laid on a compacted <b>base</b> <b>course.</b> Road surfaces are frequently marked to guide traffic.

25|$|Historically, {{laterite}} was {{cut into}} brick-like shapes {{and used in}} monument-building. After 1000 CE, construction at Angkor Wat and other southeast Asian sites changed to rectangular temple enclosures made of laterite, brick and stone. Since the mid-1970s, some trial sections of bituminous-surfaced, low-volume roads have used laterite in place of stone as a <b>base</b> <b>course.</b> Thick laterite layers are porous and slightly permeable, so the layers can function as aquifers in rural areas.

25|$|Full depth {{reclamation}} is {{a process}} which pulverizes the full thickness of the asphalt pavement {{and some of the}} underlying material to provide a uniform blend of material. A binding agent may be mixed in to form a <b>base</b> <b>course</b> for the new pavement, or it may be left unbound to form a subbase course. Common binding agents include asphalt emulsion, fly ash, Portland cement or calcium chloride. It can also be mixed with aggregate, recycled asphalt millings, or crushed Portland cement to improve the gradation of the material, and can provide a design life cycle of 30 years with proper lab testing and field verification.|$|E
25|$|During the forenoon {{watch on}} 6 July 1944, however, an escort {{on the port}} side of the convoy {{obtained}} a sound contact, the alarm prompting the ships to make an emergency 45 degree turn to starboard at 10:53. Zeus went to general quarters at 10:56, after which time an escort dropped depth charges at 10:57. The battle damage repair ship resumed her original <b>base</b> <b>course</b> at 11:13, then secured from general quarters seven minutes later. The convoy resumed zig-zagging (11:30-15:30), suspended steering those courses for a brief period while one escort and two ships from the group left on duty assigned (15:40), then again began steering zig-zag courses twenty minutes later, with Zeus being ordered to assume a new position at 16:15. The passage proceeded uneventfully for a little over an hour, before an escort ahead of the disposition made a sound contact at 17:16, with general quarters being sounded again, with the convoy steering another emergency 45 degree turn to starboard. Subsequently, the disposition resumed steering zig-zag courses at 17:30, with Zeus standing down from general quarters two minutes later. The convoy continued its zig-zagging until noon on 8 July, then reached Eniwetok a little less than four hours later. Steering various courses and speeds to conform to the channel, Zeus anchored in berth 526 in the central anchorage at 18:45.|$|E

[...] Observing Minneapolis and New Orleans taking hits and slowing, Pensacola steered to pass {{them on the}} port side and then, once past, returned to the same <b>base</b> <b>course.</b> [...] At 23:39, Pensacola took a torpedo abreast the mainmast. [...] The explosion spread flaming oil throughout the interior and across the main deck of the ship, killing 125 of the ship's crew.

500|$|As {{the chase}} entered open waters, Wake-Walker's ships were {{compelled}} to zig-zag to avoid German U-boats {{that might be}} in the area.

At 03:00 on 25 May, Lütjens ordered an increase to maximum speed, which at this point was [...] He then ordered the ship to circle away to the west and then north. This manoeuvre coincided with the period during which his ship was out of radar range; Bismarck successfully broke radar contact and circled back behind her pursuers. Suffolks captain assumed that Bismarck had broken off to the west and attempted to find her by also steaming west. After half an hour, he informed Wake-Walker, who ordered the three ships to disperse at daylight to search visually.|$|E

There {{is a small}} partial false gable roof of Spanish barrel red-clay tiles around the four sides and around the courtyard. On the front (south) facade, facing the ocean, there are five bays with a large elliptical arch-headed passageway large enough for vehicular traffic. It is architecturally marked only by a plain, flat frame painted differently {{from the body of}} the building. There are plain board, double doors with a smaller pedestrian port in the right door. In the elliptical arch there is a simple fanlight window. Flanking the arched entrance are two large high windows on each side. The windows are two-leaf casements with exterior solid and Jouvered combination paneled shutters. Metal grilles are at each window. The walls have a simple low projecting <b>base</b> <b>course,</b> and the first floor walls are marked by horizontal incised coursing, all in stucco. There is a large molded string course between stories and on the second floor, five door openings, each with double-leaf doors that are half sash, which replaced the original louvered and paneled shutter combinations. Over the doors are sashed transoms, although the right group has been replaced by air conditioners. Each opening has a decorative wrought iron balcony with scroll support dating from the U.S. remodeling of the building. Previous to these wrought-iron balconies, the building had cast iron railings. [...] "U.S. Customs" [...] is lettered over the central window. At the top is a large double masonry molded cornice, surmounted by the small false partial gable in Spanish tiles, both from 1924. On the front only, there are three flag poles on the roof, and a large antenna system. On each side of the first floor passage entry is an alarm box and a plain light fixture.|$|E
40|$|The {{steps in}} {{producing}} software are usually organized into a lifecycle consisting of several phases of development.
