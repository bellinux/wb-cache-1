40|$|The {{zebrafish}} belladonna (<b>bel)</b> mutation {{was identified}} in a large-scale mutagenesis screen to identify genes involved in retino-tectal pathfinding in Tubingen, Germany. In <b>bel</b> mutants, after exiting the eye, retinal axons grow ipsilaterally instead of crossing the midline to form optic chiasm. <b>bel</b> mutants are semi-viable and live <b>bel</b> embryos at 5 days show a 2 ̆ 2 dilated pupil 2 ̆ 2 phenotype {{after which the}} mutation was named. Later work showed that <b>bel</b> mutants have functional eyes although the optokinetic response is reversed in the mutants. Previous work in our lab showed that most retinal axons in the mutants initially grow towards the midline but later turn ipsilaterally. Also, two major forebrain commissures, the anterior commissure (AC) and the post-optic commissure (POC) also failed to form in <b>bel</b> mutants. These studies showed that <b>bel</b> defects are restricted to forebrain. Detailed analysis of eye sections showed defects in <b>bel</b> eye morphology during embryonic and adult stages. Initial work also mapped the <b>bel</b> locus on chromosome 8 and finer mapping linked one z-marker {{on either side of}} <b>bel</b> locus (z 24272 and z 44909). ^ My dissertation project was to clone the <b>bel</b> gene and understand its role in forebrain patterning and axon guidance. I identified that <b>bel</b> locus encodes a zebrafish lim-homeodomain transcription factor, Lhx 2. To further understand how bel(lhx 2) might affect axon guidance, I first showed that <b>bel</b> mutants have subtle defects in forebrain patterning in the regions where axons cross the midline. I also showed that these forebrain patterning defects lead to defects in expression of proper cellular and molecular axon guidance cues at the midline in <b>bel</b> mutants. Finally, I showed that bel(lhx 2) is required for cell proliferation in the diencephalon. Thus my detailed analysis of <b>bel</b> mutants has revealed new roles for lhx 2 in diencephalon patterning and axon guidance. ...|$|R

Then Mescal called and Wolf flashed back to her, lifting his proud head, eager, spirited, ready to take his order.
