5|$|In 1937 the Norwegian {{pathologist}} Leiv Kreyberg {{was allowed}} to examine one of Reich's bion preparations under a microscope. Kreyberg wrote that the broth Reich had used as his culture medium was indeed sterile, but that the bacteria were ordinary staphylococci. He concluded that Reich's control measures to prevent infection from airborne bacteria were not as foolproof as Reich believed. Kreyberg accused Reich of being ignorant of basic <b>bacteriological</b> and anatomical facts, while Reich accused Kreyberg of having failed to recognize living cancer cells under magnification.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur gave {{immunity}} to Shiro Ishii {{and other members}} of the <b>bacteriological</b> research units in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation. He also exempted the Emperor and all members of the imperial family implicated in war crimes, including Princes Chichibu, Asaka, Takeda, Higashikuni and Fushimi, from criminal prosecutions. MacArthur confirmed that the emperor's abdication would not be necessary. In doing so, he ignored the advice of many members of the imperial family and Japanese intellectuals who publicly called for the abdication of the Emperor and the implementation of a regency.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{remained}} {{for less than}} a year before resigning to take up a five-year appointment in Bombay as Chair of Clinical Tropical Medicine at a newly created School of Tropical Medicine, a post for which he had been nominated by the Royal Society. On arrival in India, he found that the scheme had been abandoned and that as his appointment could be terminated at six-months' notice, he would no longer be required after October 1922. Fairley demanded and received an audience with the Governor of Bombay, Sir George Lloyd, the result of which was that the Secretary of State agreed to create a special five-year post of Medical Officer of the Bombay <b>Bacteriological</b> Laboratory and Honorary Consulting Physician to the Sir Jamshedjee Jeejebhoy Hospital and St George Hospital.|$|E
5|$|In June 1940, in {{the early}} months of the Second World War, Ford volunteered for service with the Second Australian Imperial Force and was {{commissioned}} as a major in the Australian Army Medical Corps, receiving the service number NX445. In March 1941 he was sent to the Middle East as commanding officer of the 1st Australian Mobile <b>Bacteriological</b> Laboratory, and was soon engaged in the diagnosis of a variety of hitherto uncertain diseases. In July 1941, Ford's unit moved to Syria, where it was attached to the 2/3rd Casualty Clearing Station, providing the latter with the diagnostic capabilities of a larger general hospital, of which none were available.|$|E
5|$|While {{searching for}} Ernst Stavro Blofeld, {{the head of}} SPECTRE, Bond saves Tracy di Vicenzo on the beach from {{committing}} suicide by drowning, and later meets her again in a casino. Bond then receives information from Marc-Ange Draco, {{the head of the}} European crime syndicate Unione Corse and Tracy's father, about Blofeld's Swiss solicitor. Bond breaks into the solicitors office and establishes Blofeld is corresponding with the London College of Arms. Posing as an emissary of the college, Bond meets Blofeld, who has established a clinical allergy-research institute atop Piz Gloria in the Swiss Alps. Bond soon establishes that Blofeld is brainwashing his patients to distribute <b>bacteriological</b> warfare agents throughout various parts of the world.|$|E
5|$|Thom was the U.S. Delegate to the 1905 International Dairy Congress held in Paris, France. He helped {{establish}} a graduate education {{program at the}} USDA. In 1907, he became a charter member of the Dairy Association of America, and in 1918, was appointed President of the <b>Bacteriological</b> Association of Washington. He attended the 1935 International Soil Congress in Oxford, England and was Vice President of the 1939 International Microbiological Congress in New York. He {{was a member of}} the National Academy of Sciences, a charter member of the Mycological Society of America, and president of the Society of American Bacteriologists in 1940 and the Society of Industrial Microbiology in 1950. Thom was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science degree by Lake Forest College in 1936. For his work on penicillin, he and his research group received the Lasker Group Award in 1946, and the USDA Distinguished Service Award in 1947. The same year, he received a gold medal from the Spanish National Research Council for his contributions to microbiology and medicine.|$|E
5|$|Even though Croatia has {{sufficient}} water resources at its disposal, {{these are not}} uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's groundwater aquifers are top quality, unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and <b>bacteriological</b> water analysis results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system, but only 44% of the population {{have access to the}} public sewerage network, with septic systems in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, oligotrophic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased eutrophication were identified in the Bay of Bakar, the Bay of Kaštela, the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution (including 128 from vessels), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.|$|E
5|$|Farquharson was the {{director}} of medicine for Toronto veterans' hospitals from 1945 to 1947, {{and at the same time}} served as president of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. In 1947 he was appointed to the Sir John and Lady Eaton Professor of Medicine chair at the University of Toronto. From 1947 until his retirement in 1960, he was the Physician-in-Chief of the Toronto General Hospital. His well-known patients included Canadian politician George A. Drew, who he advised to resign as head of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and Leader of the Opposition following a near-fatal attack of meningitis; Drew did so, and was succeeded as party leader by John Diefenbaker, who later became Prime Minister of Canada. Farquharson established clinical teaching programs at Women's College Hospital and Sunnybrook Hospital, and expanded those already in place at St. Michael's and Toronto Western. He also appointed the first full-time clinical investigators to the Toronto medical school faculty and increased total faculty numbers from 40 to over 100. He became a Fellow of the American College of Physicians in 1947 and of the Royal College of Physicians in 1950. He was appointed a member of the <b>Bacteriological</b> Warfare Review Committee, established in 1950 by the Defence Research Board (of which he was a member from 1949 to 1952) and chaired by Dr. Charles Best. For his service to the nation, he was awarded the Queen's Coronation Medal in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The Empire of Japan invaded {{other parts}} of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). The Imperial Japanese Army swiftly {{captured}} the capital Nanjing and conducted the Nanking Massacre. In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan. On December 7–8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, British forces in Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong and declared war on the United States and the British Empire, bringing the United States and the United Kingdom into World War II in the Pacific. After Allied victories across the Pacific during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on August 15. The war cost Japan, its colonies, China and the war's other combatants {{tens of millions of}} lives and left much of Japan's industry and infrastructure destroyed. The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of ethnic Japanese from colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories. The Allies also convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East on May 3, 1946, to prosecute some Japanese leaders for war crimes. However, the <b>bacteriological</b> research units and members of the imperial family involved in the war were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers despite calls for the trial of both groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{first edition}} of the <b>Bacteriological</b> Code in 1947 sorted several {{problems}} out.|$|E

25|$|<b>Bacteriological</b> {{weapons were}} experimented on humans by the infamous unit 731 located near Harbin in Beinyinhe from 1932 to 1936 and to Pingfan until 1945. Victims, mostly Chinese, Russians and Koreans, were {{subjected}} to vivisection, sometimes without anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|Önöz agar allows {{more rapid}} <b>bacteriological</b> diagnosis, as Salmonella and Shigella colonies can be clearly and {{reliably}} differentiated from other Enterobacteriaceae. The yields of Salmonella from stool samples obtained, when using this medium, {{are higher than}} those obtained with LEIFSON agar or Salmonella–Shigella agar.|$|E
25|$|Contaminants {{found in}} {{groundwater}} cover {{a broad range}} of physical, inorganic chemical, organic chemical, <b>bacteriological,</b> and radioactive parameters. Principally, many of the same pollutants that play a role in surface water pollution may also be found in polluted groundwater, although their respective importance may differ.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{there being}} no {{official}} and complete classification of prokaryotes, the names (nomenclature) given to prokaryotes are {{regulated by the}} International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (<b>Bacteriological</b> Code), a book which contains general considerations, principles, rules, and various notes, and advises {{in a similar fashion}} to the nomenclature codes of other groups.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, there were problems regarding the chlorination systems of some water service providers. Consequently, in 1991 20% of the companies did not comply with the <b>bacteriological</b> norms. In 2006, this share had dropped to about 1%. In the same period, compliance with disinfection norms increased from 89% to more than 99%.|$|E
25|$|After {{working for}} a year as the {{director}} of the Hadassah <b>Bacteriological</b> Laboratory in Jerusalem, Kligler moved to Haifa and began his investigation and research into malaria, then the most important, destructive disease in Palestine. His anti-malaria work is considered both nationally and internationally as his most important scientific work that resulted in a malaria-free Israel several years after his death.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{has added a}} number of colleges to its corporate and associative body. In 1882 the Manitoba Medical College, which had been founded by some physicians and surgeons, {{became a part of}} the University. Charles Henry Wheeler (architect) designed the <b>Bacteriological</b> Research Building (1897), part of the Manitoba Medical College. George Creeford Browne (architect) designed the Science Building, 1899-1900.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 {{the name}} of the {{institution}} was altered to the <b>Bacteriological</b> Institute, with control moved from the agricultural department to the Home Secretary's department. Diagnostic work on human diseases by the institute was approved to the Board of Health. This included specimen examination for typhoid, diphtheria, and tuberculosis, diagnosis by bacteriology, and microscopy for tumours. Pound was appointed Government Bacteriologist and his staff consisted of three assistants.|$|E
25|$|Phyla are {{not covered}} by the <b>Bacteriological</b> code, however, the {{scientific}} community generally follows the Ncbi and Lpsn taxonomy, where the name of the phylum is generally the plural of the type genus, {{with the exception of the}} Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria, whose names do not stem from a genus name. The higher taxa proposed by Cavalier-Smith are generally disregarded by the molecular phylogeny community (e.g.) (vide supra).|$|E
25|$|In 1950, at the 5th International Congress for Microbiology, {{a journal}} was {{established}} to disseminate the committee's conclusions to the microbiological community. It first appeared the following year under the title of International Bulletin of <b>Bacteriological</b> Nomenclature and Taxonomy. In 1980, the ICSP published an exhaustive list of all existing bacterial species considered valid in the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names. Thereafter, the committee's Code required all new names to be either published or indexed in its journal to be deemed valid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bacteriological</b> weapons {{provided}} by Shirō Ishii's units were also profusely used. For example, in 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force bombed Ningbo with fleas carrying the bubonic plague. During the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials the accused, such as Major General Kiyashi Kawashima, testified that, in 1941, some 40 members of Unit 731 air-dropped plague-contaminated fleas on Changde. These attacks caused epidemic plague outbreaks. In the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, of the 10,000 Japanese soldiers who fell ill with the disease, about 1,700 Japanese troops died when the biological weapons rebounded {{on their own}} forces.|$|E
25|$|Later, plague {{was used}} during the Second Sino-Japanese War as a <b>bacteriological</b> weapon by the Imperial Japanese Army. These weapons were {{provided}} by Shirō Ishii's units and used in experiments on humans before being used on the field. For example, in 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service bombed Ningbo with fleas carrying the bubonic plague. During the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials, the accused, such as Major General Kiyashi Kawashima, testified that, in 1941, 40 members of Unit 731 air-dropped plague-contaminated fleas on Changde. These operations caused epidemic plague outbreaks.|$|E
25|$|When {{analysing}} environmental samples, {{various types}} of indicator organisms are used to check for fecal pollution of the sample. Commonly used indicators for <b>bacteriological</b> water analysis include the bacterium Escherichia coli (abbreviated as E. coli) and non-specific fecal coliforms. With regards to samples of soil, sewage sludge, biosolids or fecal matter from dry toilets, helminth eggs are a commonly used indicator. With helminth egg analysis, eggs are extracted from the sample after which a viability test is done to distinguish between viable and non viable eggs. The viable fraction of the helminth eggs in the sample is then counted.|$|E
25|$|The Queensland Stock Institute was a {{government}} scientific facility in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, {{for the research}} and prevention of disease in agricultural animals relevant to Queensland. Established in 1893, {{it was the first}} research institution in Queensland dedicated to the investigation of disease. In 1900, it was renamed the <b>Bacteriological</b> Institute when activities were officially extended to include human pathology. The institute ceased as a facility for livestock disease in 1910 when animal work was transferred to Yeerongpilly. Laboratory work relating to human disease remained at the purpose-built facility {{under the control of the}} health department until 1918.|$|E
25|$|Although {{few studies}} on water quality {{have been carried}} out {{over the last two decades}} and there is a crucial lack of {{adequate}} and consistent monitoring, scattered evidence suggests that the levels of nutrients, organic matter, and <b>bacteriological</b> contamination in water are high. For example, the proportion of samples with coliforms in aqueducts served by INAPA (the main water company, supplying 40 percent of the population) increased from 17 percent in 1994 to 23 percent in 1998. This is particularly striking because according to DR standards, presence of coliforms in more than 5 percent of samples indicates that water is no longer potable.|$|E
25|$|Service {{quality is}} {{generally}} good with continuous water supply. In early 2008 private operators published {{for the first}} time consolidated performance indicators on service quality. It showed that 99.7% of samples complied with <b>bacteriological</b> standards for drinking water quality, but only 82.3% of samples complied with standards for the discharge of treated wastewater. The share of unplanned water service interruptions was less than 3%. The indicators do not include statistics on sewer overflows. A decree of May 2007 requires public service providers to provide the same information on service quality to the public that has been provided by private service providers, beginning in 2008.|$|E
25|$|From {{the first}} {{identification}} of a bacterial species in 1872, microbial species were named according to the binomial nomenclature, based on largely subjective descriptive characteristics. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, however, it was clear that this nomenclature and classification system required reform. Although several different comprehensive nomenclature systems were invented (most notably, that described in Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, first published in 1923), none gained international recognition. In 1930, a single international body, now named the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes (ICSP), was established to oversee all aspects of prokaryotic nomenclature. Work began in 1936 on drafting a Code of <b>Bacteriological</b> Nomenclature, the first version of which was approved in 1947.|$|E
25|$|Water quality. In 2015 WASREB {{reported}} that 23 utilities provided good quality water (defined {{as more than}} 95% compliance with standards), 15 acceptable quality and for 53 utilities water quality was not acceptable (defined as less than 90% compliance). The two parameters measured were residual chlorine (40% weight) and compliance with <b>bacteriological</b> standards (60% weight). If the number of samples taken was lower than foreseen in the standard, the compliance was rated lower. The highest compliance was achieved in Kericho and Kisumu with 100% each. A citizens' report carried out in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu in 2007 provided information about customers' perception of water quality: around 70% of households using water from connections to the mains said they found the taste and smell of water acceptable, and that the water was clear. Even so, {{the vast majority of}} respondents treat water prior to consumption, which shows continuing uncertainty about its quality.|$|E
25|$|Fernando E. Rodríguez Vargas, a dentist, {{joined the}} United States Army on August 16, 1917, and on September 14, was {{commissioned}} a First Lieutenant. Rodríguez Vargas {{was assigned to}} the Army Dental Reserve Corps and attended a course at the Medical Officer's Training Camp at Camp Greenleaf, Georgia before being sent overseas to the United Kingdom. In August 1919, he was reassigned to San Juan, Puerto Rico and served in Camp Las Casas. On February 18, 1921, Rodriguez Vargas was sent to Washington, D.C. and assigned to the Army Dental Corps where he continued his investigations in the field of bacteriology. Rodríguez Vargas was there as an educator and investigator of the <b>bacteriological</b> aspects of dental diseases. His research led him to discover the bacteria which causes dental caries. According to his investigations, three types of the Lactobacillus species, during the process of fermentation, are the causes of cavities.|$|E
25|$|In January 2005 the Chilean Army {{accepted}} institutional {{responsibility for}} past human rights abuses. In 2006 Pinochet was indicted for kidnappings and torture at the Villa Grimaldi detention center by judge Alejandro Madrid (Guzmán's successor), {{as well as}} for the 1995 assassination of the DINA biochemist Eugenio Berrios, himself involved in the Letelier case. Berrios, who had worked with Michael Townley, had produced sarin gas, anthrax and botulism in the <b>Bacteriological</b> War Army Laboratory for Pinochet; these materials were used against political opponents. The DINA biochemist was also alleged to have created black cocaine, which Pinochet then sold in Europe and the United States. The money for the drug trade was allegedly deposited into Pinochet's bank accounts. Pinochet's son Marco Antonio, who had been accused of participating in the drug trade, in 2006 denied claims of drug trafficking in his father's administration and said that he would sue Manuel Contreras, who had said that Pinochet sold cocaine.|$|E
25|$|From August to November 1917, {{amidst a}} deteriorating war situation, Slătineanu {{took refuge in}} Kharkov, Russia. There, the {{director}} of the local <b>bacteriological</b> institute adopted his method for preparing an anti-cholera vaccine in large quantities and administering it in a single dose. From his return until the following year, he headed Cantacuzino's experimental medicine laboratory, which had been evacuated to Iași from German-occupied Bucharest. The laboratory prepared serums and vaccines for the Romanian, Russian and French armies operating in the area, {{as well as for the}} local civilian population and for refugees who had fled from the German-occupied part of the country. Thus, with the need to import the preparations eliminated, the treasury was saved over 3 million lei in gold. For his war efforts, he was granted the Order of Queen Marie, first class (1917); the commander of the Order of the Crown with swords; and the knighthood of the Legion of Honour (1918).|$|E
25|$|Doctors at the Scottish Hospital at Royaumont made {{numerous}} important discoveries, {{although their}} contribution {{was not always}} acknowledged and their work required rediscovery. Dr Savill presented to the Royal Society of Medicine in 1916 her work {{in the use of}} X-rays to diagnose the presence of gas gangrene infection before the <b>bacteriological</b> reports could and before the advent of symptoms. This work was not widely accepted and in 1917 she expressed a desire that other radiologists consider this work to confirm her conclusions. Dr. Ivens presented on a similar topic and both Dr. Ivens and Dr. Savill's presentations were reviewed in the British Medical Journal. In related work, Dr E. J. Dalyell published in the British Medical Journal in 1917 about the presence of B. oedematiens in gas gangrene. Subsequent work on the use of X-ray for the diagnosis of gas gangrene do not refer to the work of SMH doctors. Among other work, Dr Henry wrote an MD thesis on the treatment of wounds that she presented in 1920.|$|E
25|$|Groundwater: The water {{emerging}} from some deep ground water may have fallen as rain many tens, hundreds, {{or thousands of}} years ago. Soil and rock layers naturally filter the ground water to {{a high degree of}} clarity and often, it does not require additional treatment besides adding chlorine or chloramines as secondary disinfectants. Such water may emerge as springs, artesian springs, or may be extracted from boreholes or wells. Deep ground water is generally of very high <b>bacteriological</b> quality (i.e., pathogenic bacteria or the pathogenic protozoa are typically absent), but the water may be rich in dissolved solids, especially carbonates and sulfates of calcium and magnesium. Depending on the strata through which the water has flowed, other ions may also be present including chloride, and bicarbonate. There may be a requirement to reduce the iron or manganese content of this water to make it acceptable for drinking, cooking, and laundry use. Primary disinfection may also be required. Where groundwater recharge is practiced (a process in which river water is injected into an aquifer to store the water in times of plenty so that it is available in times of drought), the groundwater may require additional treatment depending on applicable state and federal regulations.|$|E
