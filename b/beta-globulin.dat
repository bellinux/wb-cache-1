Among the sera with autoantibody activity 29 percent showed deviations of the normal kappa/lambda ratio of immunoglobulins, as opposed to 22 percent of the sera without detected autoantibody activity. In 3 percent of the sera an M component was detected. Determination of the alpha 1 -acid glycoprotein, alpha 1 -antitrypsin, haptoglobin, haemopexin, complement component C 3 c and C 4, IgG, IgA and IgM levels showed significant increases in alpha-, and <b>beta-globulins</b> {{as well as in}} IgG and IgA in sera of the aged persons as compared to a normal population between 20 and 60 years old. No significant difference was noted between the gamma-globulin concentration in sera of aged persons with or without autoantibody activity. The evaluation of the relationship between serum protein levels and alterations of the kappa/lambda ratio indicated that the alpha- and the <b>beta-globulins</b> were significantly raised in sera with altered kappa/lambda ratios, whereas, with the exception of M component containing sera the gamma-globulin levels seemed not significantly affected by changes in this ratio...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Fluids were {{obtained}} from 185 rabbit uteri 1 to 20 weeks after uterine ligation. The uterine fluid proteins were concentrated with an ultrafilter and characterized by diffusion in agar gel, moving boundary electrophoresis, and immunoelectrophoresis. Eight electrophoretic components were identified by means of moving boundary electro-phoresis. One which migrated as a pre-albumin and another which migrated as an alpha-globulin were not found in blood sera. Agar-gel diffusion tests revealed thirteen antigenic components in uterine fluid. Three precipitin lines appeared to be specific to uterine fluid after absorption ofguinea-pig antisera to rabbit uterine fluid with rabbit blood sera. However, at least five antigens {{which could not be}} found in blood sera were identified in uterine fluid by means of immunoelectrophoresis.

40|$|Isolated hepatic disease rarely {{occurs during}} pregnancy. A number of {{associations}} between hepatic dysfunction and pregnancy exist. Acute viral hepatitis is {{most common cause}} of jaundice in pregnancy. The course of acute hepatitis is not affected in pregnancy however hepatitis E virus is associated with increased complications especially in the third trimester of gestation. Women with chronic liver disease exhibit higher risk of fetal loss during pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia associated with HELPP syndrome results in increased maternal and fetal mortality. The liver serves multiple functions: the biotransformation of insoluble compounds (e. g., drugs, toxins, bilirubin), the metabolism and excretion of cholesterol and bilirubin, the production of plasma proteins(e. g. albumin, coagulation factors, alpha-and <b>beta-globulins,</b> transferrin, haptoglobin), and the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids. No single liver function test is available to quantify liver disease. Increased level of AST and ALT determine liver cell necrosis, while synthetic function is quantified by determining albumin level and prothrombin time. Cholestasis and biliary obstruction are evaluated by measuring alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, 5 â€“ nucleotidase or gamma glutamyl transpeptidase levels 1.

Animals were shipped to a breeding center in different seasons, and selected parameters of innate immunity (serum bactericidal activity, hemolytic complement, serum albumin, ÃŽÂ±, ÃŽÂ², and ÃŽÂ³-globulins, interleukin- 6, TNF-ÃŽÂ±) were monitored before and after the arrival at days- 4 / 0 / 4 / 15 / 30.

Eighty one people, naÃ¯ve of HAART, â€Žparticipated voluntarily in the study. HIV screening was systematically done according to WHO â€Žrecommendations.

Clinical symptoms of these states are not only non-specific, but also have similarities with many different infectious and non-infectious diseases. This {{is the cause of}} incorrect diagnoses. In some cases, pathology simulate acute respiratory infections, bronchitis, urticaria, bronchial asthma and asthmatic bronchitis, eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates, sometimes persistent blepharitis. In the clinical pattern of helminthiasis, vegeÂ­tative and neurological symptoms often dominate that is due to pathogenetic features of helminthic intoxication. Furthermore, symptoms typical of acute leukemia, migratory eosinophilic pneumonia, abscesses, tumors of the soft tissues and bones may have parasitic origin. Various and non-specific manifestations of helminthiasis are crucial in laboratory diagnostics. One of the most popular drugs in the clinical practice of moÂ­dern pediatrics among known broad-spectrum anthelmintics of benzimidazole group is albendazole (Vormil). Systemic action of Vormil is related to its active metabolite â€” albendazole sulfoxide, which is formed in the liver. The drug inhibits the polymerization of <b>beta-globulin,</b> resulting in violations in the formation of cytoplasmic microtubules of helminth cells, so this drug is active against different parasite species...|$|E
40|$|A {{database}} of potentially biologically active peptide sequences, named BIOPEP ([URL] {{has been developed}} and applied for classification of numerous food proteins as potential sources of peptides with antihypertensive activity. More than one hundred proteins included in the BIOPEP database were analyzed and classified according to {{the frequency of the}} occurrence of antihypertensive fragments. As the example of detailed profile of potential biological activity, the bovine <b>beta-globulin</b> A is presented. It was found that apart from the dominant antihypertensive activity, other effects (opioid, dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitory, immunomodulative, antioxidative) may be present. It can be concluded that this method may be a useful tool in this field. The antihypertensive activity was the most dominant because fragments with such activity were present in all of the examined proteins. It encouraged us to classify proteins into families, which may be better or the worse source of antihypertensive fragments. We found statistically significant differences between the values of parameter A (P< 0. 001) among the all five families we obtained. We found that in silico analysis can be useful in the analysis of the large quantities of data in the field of proteins as the source of biologically active peptides...|$|E

The pooled globulin was treated by exposure to a wide pH range, to ethanol, and to heat; and the resultant effects of such pretreatment on the augmentation phenomenon then observed.
