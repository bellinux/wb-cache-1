5|$|Although the 2012 Olympic men's {{basketball}} tournament was then {{more than a}} year away, qualifying tournaments in all five of FIBA's continental zones were to be held in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2011 (the traditional basketball offseason throughout the world). The lockout resulted in the suspension of an agreement between the NBA and FIBA <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> NBA would take on most of the costs for insuring the value of its players' contracts in the event they were injured during international competition. As a result, national federations that wish to have NBA players on their squads must now provide full coverage instead of supplemental insurance.|$|E
5|$|Amenhotep's reign saw {{literary}} developments. The Book of What {{is in the}} Underworld ('the Egyptian Book of the Dead'), {{an important}} funerary text used in the New Kingdom, {{is believed to have}} reached its final form during Amenhotep's reign, since it first appears in the decoration of the tomb of his successor Thutmose I. The Ebers papyrus, which is the main source for information on ancient Egyptian medicine, also seems to date to this time (the mention of the Heliacal rise of Sothis <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> early New Kingdom chronology is usually calculated was found on the back of this document).|$|E
5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E

5|$|Article Seven of the {{proposed}} Constitution set the terms <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> new frame of government would be established.

Only then would it replace the existing government under the Articles of Confederation and would apply only to those states that ratified it.|$|E
5|$|As the {{economic}} situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuroń and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the (still) ruling party {{of some of its}} burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.|$|E

5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed two {{lines in the}} crowd a few yards apart, {{in an attempt to}} form a {{corridor}} through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, streams flowed from {{highlands}} in central Arizona north and across what is today the western Grand Canyon, possibly feeding a larger river. The mechanism <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> ancestral Lower Colorado River captured this drainage and the drainage from {{much of the}} rest of the Colorado Plateau is not known. Possible explanations include headward erosion or a broken natural dam of a lake or river. Whatever the cause, the Lower Colorado probably captured the landlocked Upper Colorado somewhere west of the Kaibab Uplift. The much larger drainage area and yet steeper stream gradient helped to further accelerate downcutting.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed {{the idea of the}} verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E

When they refused, in 926, Kourkouas led the army across the border. Aided by his brother Theophilos and an Armenian {{contingent}} under the strategos of Lykandos, Mleh (Melias in Greek sources), Kourkouas targeted Melitene (modern Malatya), the center of an emirate which had long been a thorn in Byzantium's side. The Byzantine army successfully stormed the lower city, and although the citadel held out, Kourkouas concluded a treaty <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> emir accepted tributary status.|$|E
5|$|Cementum is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering {{the root of}} a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within {{the root of the}} tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of the root. The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of the root apex.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are known as infectious diseases, and the causative biological agent involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> pathogen is introduced into the body is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E

5|$|In Presbyterian {{worship the}} sermon, {{which could be}} several hours long, was seen as central, meaning that {{services}} tended to have a didactic and wordy character. There were also Bible readings and the only participation by the congregation was musical, in the singing of the psalms. From the late seventeenth century the common practice was lining out, <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> precentor sang or read out each line {{and it was then}} repeated by the congregation. From the second quarter of the eighteenth century it was argued that this should be abandoned in favour of the practice of singing stanza by stanza. These innovations became linked to a choir movement that included the setting up of schools to teach new tunes and singing in four parts.|$|E
