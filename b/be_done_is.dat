The power of the Court to require that this <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore. While the other prerogative orders may only be applied for with the court's permission, an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court.|$|E

"I {{think the}} fall in bank lending would have been worse had we not {{conducted}} our asset purchases because what we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> injecting money into the economy and what the banking system has <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> destroying money.

25|$|Erythromelalgia is a {{difficult}} condition to diagnose as there are no specific tests available. However, reduced capillary density has been observed microscopically during flaring; and reduced capillary perfusion is noted in the patient. Another test that can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> to have the patient elevate their legs, and note the reversal (from red to pale) in skin color. Tests done at universities include quantitative sensory nerve testing, laser evoked potentials, sweat testing and epidermal sensory nerve fiber density test (which is an objective test for small fiber sensory neuropathy). Due the aforementioned factors, patients may face delays in diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Professional diving {{operations}} are usually formally planned {{and the plan}} documented as a legal record that due diligence has been done for health and safety purposes. Recreational dive planning may be less formal, but for complex technical dives, can be as formal, detailed and extensive as most professional dive plans. A professional diving contractor will be constrained by the code of practice, standing orders or regulatory legislation covering a project or specific operations within a project, and is responsible for ensuring that {{the scope of work}} to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> within the scope of the rules relevant to that work. A recreational (including technical) diver or dive group is generally less constrained, but nevertheless is almost always restricted by some legislation, and often also the rules of the organisations to which the divers are affiliated.|$|E

The ilekes necklace is bathed in a mixture of herbs, sacrificial blood, and other potent substances and given to the initiated.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{numerous}} similarities, scholars have frequently connected Freyja with the goddess Frigg. The connection with Frigg and question of possible earlier identification of Freyja with Frigg in the Proto-Germanic period (Frigg and Freyja origin hypothesis) remains {{a matter of}} scholarly discourse. Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar Stephan Grundy comments that [...] "the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja {{may have been a}} single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported." ...|$|E

2500|$|In some cases, {{the best}} that can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> to reduce the {{entrance}} of water runoff from higher, stable elevations by capturing and bypassing through channels or pipes, and to drain water infiltrated directly and from subsurface springs by inserting horizontal perforated tubes. There are numerous locations in California where extensive developments have been built atop archaic landslides, which have not moved in historic times but which (if both water-saturated and shaken by an earthquake) have a high probability of moving en masse, carrying entire sections of suburban development to new locations. While the most modern of house structures (well tied to [...] monolithic concrete foundation slabs reinforced with post tensioning cables) may survive such movement largely intact, the building {{will no longer be}} in its proper location.|$|E
2500|$|In gauge theory, {{especially}} in non-abelian gauge theories, global problems at gauge fixing are often encountered. Gauge fixing means choosing {{a representative from}} each gauge orbit, that is, choosing a section of a fiber bundle. The space of representatives is a submanifold (of the bundle as a whole) and represents the gauge fixing condition. Ideally, every gauge orbit will intersect this submanifold once and only once. Unfortunately, this is often impossible globally for non-abelian gauge theories because of topological obstructions and the best that can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> make this condition true locally. A gauge fixing submanifold may not intersect a gauge orbit at all or it may intersect it more than once. The difficulty arises because the gauge fixing condition is usually specified as a differential equation of some sort, e.g. that a divergence vanish (as in the Landau or Lorenz gauge). The solutions to this equation may end up specifying multiple sections, or perhaps none at all. [...] This is called a Gribov ambiguity (named after Vladimir Gribov).|$|E
2500|$|It is hard {{to place}} an exact value on the money stolen through {{insurance}} fraud. Insurance fraud is deliberately undetectable, unlike visible crimes such as robbery or murder. As such, {{the number of cases}} of insurance fraud that are detected is much lower than the number of acts that are actually committed. [...] The best that can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> to provide an estimate for the losses that insurers suffer due to insurance fraud. [...] The Coalition Against Insurance Fraud estimates that in 2006 a total of about $80 billion was lost in the United States due to insurance fraud. [...] According to estimates by the Insurance Information Institute, insurance fraud accounts for about 10 percent of the property/casualty insurance industry’s incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. [...] The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association estimates that 3% of the health care industry’s expenditures in the United States are due to fraudulent activities, amounting to a cost of about $51 billion. [...] Other estimates attribute as much as 10% of the total healthcare spending in the United States to fraud—about $115 billion annually. Another study of all types of fraud committed in the United States insurance institutions (property-and-casualty, business liability, healthcare, social security, etc.)put the true cost at 33% to 38% of the total cash flow through the system. This study resulted in the book title [...] "The Trillion Dollar Insurance Crook" [...] by J.E. Smith. In the United Kingdom, the Insurance Fraud Bureau estimates that the loss due to insurance fraud in the United Kingdom is about £1.5 billion ($3.08 billion), causing a 5% increase in insurance premiums. [...] The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimates that personal injury fraud in Canada costs about C$500 million annually.|$|E
