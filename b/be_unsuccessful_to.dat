However, given the size of existing datasets, lack of statistics to describe available sources, and unpredictable conditions of remote queries, existing solutions are still insufficient. First, the most efficient RDF engines rely their query processing algorithms on physical access and storage structures that are locally stored; however, because of the size of existing linked datasets, loading the data and their links is not always feasible.

30|$|Resistance of {{developed}} {{bacteria to}} antibiotic treatment {{is a very}} important issue, because introduction of any new antibiotic is after a little while followed by the formation of resistant bacterial isolates in the clinic. The significant increase in clinical resistance to antibiotics is a troubling situation especially in nosocomial infections, where already defenseless patients can <b>be</b> <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>to</b> respond to treatment, causing even greater health issue. Nosocomial infections can be identified as those happening within 2  days of hospital acceptance, 3  days of discharge or 1  month of an operation. They influence 1 out of 10 patients admitted to hospital. Annually, this outcomes in 5000 deaths only in UK with a cost to the National Health Service of a billion pounds. Despite these problems, antibiotic therapy is still the most common method used to treat bacterial infections. On the other hand, it is often mentioned that immune system {{plays a major role in}} the progress of infections. In this context, we proposed a mathematical model defining population dynamics of both the specific immune cells produced according to the properties of bacteria by host and the bacteria exposed to multiple antibiotics synchronically, presuming that resistance is gained through mutations due to exposure to antibiotic. Qualitative analysis found out infection-free equilibrium point and other equilibrium points where resistant bacteria and immune system cells exist, only resistant bacteria exists and sensitive bacteria, resistant bacteria and immune system cells exist. As a result of this analysis, our model highlights the fact that when an individual’s immune system weakens, he/she suffers more from the bacterial infections which are believed to have been confined or terminated. Also, these results was supported by numerical simulations.|$|E

The objective is also to research how those problems can affect the evaluation of M&A performance and what kinds of principles should be taken into account in order to solve those problems. These effects can be either affecting the process of the performance evaluation or affecting the performance of the M&A case. This study also aims to get a deeper insight into the basic problems of accounting that need to be solved in order to gain better understanding of the performance evaluation. METHODOLOGY AND DATA The research method is a qualitative single case study. The empirical data was mainly collected through seven semi-structured interviews of personnel working with mergers and acquisitions in the case company. MAIN FINDINGS The main conclusion of the study is that the basic problems of accounting can have a substantial impact on the evaluation of M&A performance. If the problems are not solved, it can lead to a situation where the performance evaluation cannot be done in a reliable way. If the reliability of the performance evaluation of M&A is questioned, the evaluation adds no value into assessing whether M&A case was successful or not. It was also discovered that there are some other problems, for example cultural issues, that might have an effect on the M&A performance evaluation in addition to the basic problems of accounting. This means that even though all the basic problems are solved, the evaluation process might still <b>be</b> <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>to</b> produce a valuable outcome...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, organic {{thin-film}} electronics {{have emerged}} as a route towards flexible, low-cost, large area applications, which are unfeasible in the current silicon technology. For example, low-cost radio frequency identification (RFID) tags that can be placed on any object, as envisioned by the Internet of Things, for smart labeling, security, monitoring, or tracking purposes. For these applications, a nonvolatile memory functionality is crucial for their intended operation. Therefore, simultaneous {{to the development of}} organic transistors and circuits, progress needs to be made towards a compatible nonvolatile, electrically reprogrammable memory array. In this doctoral research, we aim to realize such an organic memory array that can be integrated with the organic logic circuits on the same, flexible substrate. More specifically, we focus on the device architecture and materials of ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFET) as the basic memory unit. The objective of this work was pursued by a combination of i) technological advancements over the state-of-the-art; ii) further understanding of the device operation; iii) devising a read-and write scheme suited for an array; and iv) use of novel materials and device architectures. By optimizing the processing conditions, we demonstrate high-performance bottom gate - top contact (BG-TC) FeFETs with pentacene as the organic semiconductor, as shown in Chapter 2. These memory devices can switch within a few ms, and can be cycled for at least 10000 times. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate a long term retention data of more than one year. These results make this device highly promising for non-volatile memory applications. Unexpectedly for a bi-stable material, the BG-TC FeFET shows three reprogrammable memory states: OFF, Intermediate and ON state. Using Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy, we elucidate the device operation in this device structure in Chapter 3. These measurements show that the ferroelectric layer in the channel region of the FeFET is not fully polarized in the OFF and Intermediate states. The difference between these two states can be explained by a different injection property of the contacts, caused by the ferroelectric polarization state underneath the source-drain contacts. This refinement clarifies the peculiarities experimentally found in literature, as well as in our own results. To integrate with organic circuits, as well as to fabricate memory arrays, photolithography must be used. In addition, the bottom gate - bottom contact (BG-BC) device architecture needs to be adopted. By further technology development, we realize such a memory FeFET that can be integrated with current state-of-the-art organic circuits on flexible substrates, as demonstrated in Chapter 4. Moreover, we employ this technology to fabricate a passive NAND array, as described in Chapter 5. The NAND architecture was chosen, as it offers the highest possible density of all transistor memory arrays. Despite the fact that passive arrays are more challenging to reliably address all FeFETs, we demonstrate a non-destructive read and write operation in the NAND array. Finally, novel device architecture and materials are explored to improve the memory characteristics in Chapter 6. Replacing pentacene with novel, high mobility semiconductors alone are proven to <b>be</b> <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>to</b> enlarge the memory window in the BG-BC FeFET. On the other hand, by adapting a planar heterojunction structure in the device, the memory window can be significantly enlarged by 30 - 60 %. The heterojunction device architecture is promising for further improvements, as many combinations of organic semiconducting materials are possible.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Engenharia de Tecidos, Medicina Regenerativa e Células EstaminaisBone is a {{specialized}} tissue characterized by its rigidity and hardness, yet light weighed to fulfill diverse functions as mineral storage, organ protection or body support and locomotion. Despite its extraordinary healing ability, bone response may <b>be</b> <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>to</b> repair severe {{damage caused by}} injury or degenerative diseases. Furthermore, when bone is affected, other tissues and interfaces might be quite distressed as well. Cartilage and bone interface of the joints (osteochondral interfaces) is particularly affected by traumatic injuries and aging diseases. The challenge lies in balancing the structural, functional and biological needs of bone and cartilage in a stable milieu. As currently used therapies do not provide the ideal treatment, the development of biological substitutes through tissue engineering (TE) approaches may provide the ultimate solutions to restore, maintain, or improve bone and osteochondral tissue function. Scaffolds play an imperative role in most TE strategies, where {{they are expected to}} guide cellular distribution and colonization, similarly to the natural occurring communications between cells and tissue, and to provide mechanical support during tissue regeneration. Nevertheless, in large damaged areas, scaffolding alone might be insufficient to promote a satisfactory healing response. Culturing stem cells onto the scaffolds has demonstrated to promote the regeneration of damaged tissues. Stem cells (SCs) can be found in almost every tissue, evidencing their role in repairing injuries. Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) are the most studied, and promising candidates for autologous TE approaches minimizing disease transmission risks but shown to be donor age-affected and had limited self-renewal capability. These limitations directed research into other stem cells sources, such as amniotic fluid (AF), that have shown to be an almost unlimited SCs source with high proliferative and osteogenic potential. Along with the almost endless ability to expand without telomere shortening, amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSCs) share with embryonic stem cells some markers and a high self renewal capacity. In this Thesis several potential approaches were considered aiming at bone and osteochondral TE, focusing on distinct scaffold design and composition, previously or newly developed, and distinct stem cells sources. Different animal models were used to evaluate the proposed strategies with scaffolds and/or cell-scaffold constructs. As a first approach, a multilayered scaffold was developed composed of tricalcium phosphate (TCP) granules entrapped in a polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber mesh, inspired from the natural organic-inorganic nanostructure of bone. A synergistic effect of PCL-TCP scaffolds and mechanical stimulation was observed in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs cultured onto these scaffolds, resulting in the production of a mineralized ECM, even in basal medium. Composite multilayered scaffolds showed an interesting behavior under dynamic conditions using cell culturing media without osteogenic supplements. Another approach consisted in the combination of wet-spinning technology and a calcium silicate solution to produce SPCL (starch and polycaprolactone blend) wet-spun fiber meshes with functionalized silanol groups (SPCL-Si). The purpose was to developed new bioactive materials linking the properties of classical bioactive ceramics, and the processability and degradability of an organic polymer. SPCL-Si scaffolds own intrinsic properties to sustain in vitro osteogenic features, and thus holding a great potential for bone engineering approaches. Additionally, this Thesis aimed at designing a new construct for the repair of osteochondral (OC) interfaces, proposing a novel bilayered scaffold, combining the well described agarose gels for cartilage and the promising SPCL scaffolds for bone, encapsulated/seeded with amniotic stem cells (AFSCs). An OC engineered system was successfully developed, where both osteo- or chondrogenic differentiated AFSCs maintained long term viability and phenotypic expression, even in basal medium after assembling of the bilayered construct. Another major original objective of this Thesis was to explore the potential of amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSCs), as compared to bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), for bone TE applications. Besides their source, the environmental conditions are known to influence cell response, and thus, both AFSCs and BMSCs were seeded/cultured in either 2 D or 3 D (using SPCL scaffolds) conditions. AFSCs and BMSCs expressed different bone-related markers at different time points. This study demonstrated that the selection of a particular stem cell type may not be a simple and direct process and relies on the target TE strategy. Finally, non-critical sized defects were induced in goat femurs so as to understand the role of the scaffold material -SPCL- and the influence of culturing autologous mesenchymal cells with/without pre-culture in osteogenic medium. Neobone formation and cellular distribution was increased in cell seeded SPCL scaffolds (pre-differentiation condition), showing the relevance of implanted cells in the bone regeneration process, and suggesting the importance of the stage of osteogenic differentiation of seeded cells. In a similar approach, femoral critical sized defects were induced in nude rats and SPCL scaffolds were implanted with or without AFSCs under different stages of osteogenic differentiation. The bridging effect between the bone segments was more prominent in scaffolds with osteogenic committed cells, and large blood vessels were observed, especially in SPCL scaffolds seeded with undifferentiated cells or osteogenic-like cells. Both in vivo studies showed the potential of SPCL scaffolds as a tissue 3 D support for the regeneration of bone and underlined the importance of stem cells and stem cells stage of differentiation for achieving enhanced bone tissue regeneration. In summary, the described scaffold design and composition show a great potential to be tailored to specific applications in bone tissue regeneration strategies. Nevertheless, SPCL meshes obtained from melt spun fibers are clearly one step ahead as scaffold structures, showing to provide the necessary support for bone and osteochondral TE strategies using different sources of stem cells. Most importantly, the work described in this Thesis clearly demonstrated that bone tissue engineering requires the presence of stem cells, and that their pre-differentiation into the osteoblastic phenotype facilitates bone regeneration...|$|E
