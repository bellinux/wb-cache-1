5|$|Porcini {{are sold}} fresh in markets {{in summer and}} autumn in Central and Southern Europe, and dried or canned at other times of the year, and {{distributed}} worldwide to countries where they are not otherwise found. They are eaten and enjoyed raw, sautéed with butter, ground into pasta, in soups, and in many other dishes. In France, they are used in recipes such as cèpes à la Bordelaise, cèpe frits and cèpe aux tomates. Porcini risotto is a traditional Italian autumn dish. Porcini are a feature of many cuisines, including Provençal, and Viennese. They are used in soups and consumed blanched in salads in Thailand. Porcini can also be frozen—either raw or first cooked in butter. The colour, aroma, and taste of frozen porcini deteriorate noticeably if frozen longer than four months. <b>Blanching</b> or soaking and <b>blanching</b> as a processing step before freezing can extend the freezer life up to 12 months. They are {{also one of the}} few mushroom species pickled and sold commercially.|$|E

25|$|In the {{two-stage}} or two-bath method, {{the first}} bath, sometimes called <b>blanching,</b> is in hot fat (around 160°C / 320°F) to cook them through. This may {{be done in}} advance. Then they are more briefly fried in very hot fat (190°C / 375°F) to crisp the exterior. They are then placed in a colander or on a cloth to drain, salted, and served. The exact times of the two baths depend {{on the size of}} the potatoes. For example, for 2–3mm strips, the first bath takes about 3 minutes, and the second bath takes only seconds.|$|E
25|$|After the nasolabial flap {{has been}} emplaced, the flap donor-site wound is sutured closed. For a wound of the lateral nasal wall {{that is less}} than 15mm wide, the flap donor-site can be closed primarily, with sutures. For a wound wider than 15mm—especially a wound that comprehends the alar lobule and the lateral wall of the nose—primary closure is not indicated, because such a wound closure imposes {{excessive}} stresses upon the skin flap, thereby risking either <b>blanching</b> (whitening) or distortion, or both. Such risks are avoided by advancing (moving) {{the skin of the}} cheek towards the nasofacial junction, where it is sutured to the deep tissues. Furthermore, a narrow wound, less than 1mm wide can be allowed to heal by secondary intention (autonomous re-epithelialisation).|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} process of TV dinners is highly automated and undergoes three major steps. Those steps are food preparation, tray loading, and freezing. During food preparation, {{vegetables and fruits}} are usually placed on a movable belt and washed, then are placed into a container to be steamed or boiled for 1–3 minutes. This process {{is referred to as}} <b>blanching,</b> and is used as a method to destroy enzymes in the food that can cause chemical changes negatively affecting overall flavor and color of the fruit and vegetables. As for meats, prior to cooking, they are trimmed of fat and cut into proper sizes. The fish is usually cleaned and cut into fillets, and poultry is usually washed thoroughly and dressed. Meats are then seasoned, placed on trays, and are cooked in an oven for a predetermined amount of time. After all the food is ready to be packaged, it is sent to the filling lines. The food is placed in its compartments as the trays pass under numerous filling machines; to ensure that every packaged dinner gets an equal amount of food, the filling devices are strictly regulated.|$|E

The enzyme action will merely be inhibited, and <b>blanching</b> of suitably sized prepared vegetables before freezing mitigates this and prevents off-flavors developing. Not all micro-organisms will be killed at these temperatures and after thawing the vegetables should be used promptly because otherwise, any microbes present may proliferate.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 A quality {{problem that}} {{frequently}} occurs with frozen green beans is the sloughing {{of the skin}} (epidermal tissues) of the cooked, ready-to- serve bean pods. It was found that by giving the beans a pre-blanch (relatively mild heat treatment) prior to the <b>blanch</b> treatment normally used for frozen green beans, on cooking, sloughing was markedly reduced, and furthermore, the bean pods were firmer. As an additional heat treatment was involved, over and above what is now used for commercial packs of frozen green beans, it was of interest to know {{the extent to which}} the color of the beans was affected. Also of interest was the effect of storage at 0 °F for four months on the color of the beans. The color changes in the dual and single <b>blanched</b> green beans were evaluated by two methods: (1) a physical analysis of the light reflected from the beans (Hunter Color and Color Difference Meter) and, (2) a physical analysis of the light absorbing properties of the pigments extracted from the beans and subsequent calculation of the per cent conversion of chlorophyll to pheophytin. Texture (firmness), as indicated by resistance to shear, was measured by a modified Kramer Shear Press. A mechanical device was used to determine the amount of sloughing of the skins of the bean pods. After a statistical analysis of the data collected in the experiment, the following conclusions were drawn: 1. The firmness of the cooked, dual and single <b>blanched,</b> frozen green beans, as measured by the shear press, was found to be highly significantly negatively correlated with sloughing of the skins. 2. There was no change in lightness or darkness of the color of single or dual <b>blanched</b> beans over storage at 0 °F for four months. The Hunter "-a [subscript L]/b [subscript L]" index of color noted a significant change in hue from green towards yellow of the single and dual <b>blanched</b> beans. The conversion of chlorophyll to pheophytin was not significant over storage. 3. The color of those beans receiving the 200 °F - 150 second final <b>blanch</b> (single <b>blanch)</b> was the same as the color of those beans receiving the 210 °F - 105 second final <b>blanch</b> (single <b>blanch).</b> 4. As the time and temperature of the pre-blanch increased, there was a corresponding increase in the amount of chlorophyll converted to pheophytin, and a change in the visual color of the beans from green towards yellow. The effect of variations of time of preblanch was much greater on the color of the dual <b>blanched</b> beans than the effect of variations of temperature of pre-blanch. 5. As the time and temperature of the pre-blanch increased, the texture (firmness) of the cooked dual <b>blanched</b> beans increased. The 200 °F - 150 second final <b>blanch</b> resulted in beans that were firmer than beans receiving the 210 °F - 105 second final <b>blanch,</b> 6. A pre-blanch at 170 °F for 30 seconds followed by a final <b>blanch</b> at 200 °F for 150 seconds was found to result in beans that were similar in color, yet firmer in texture (less sloughing of the skins) than the single <b>blanched</b> beans...|$|R
