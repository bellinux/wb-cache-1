60|$|The South-Eastern Railway is {{only one}} {{striking}} instance of the general unserviceableness of private ownership for public services. Nearly all the British railway companies, in greater or less degree, present now a similar degenerative process. Years of profit-sweating, of high dividends, have left them with old stations, old rolling stock, old staffs, bad habits and diminishing <b>borrowing</b> <b>power.</b> Only {{a few of these}} corporations make any attempt to keep pace with invention. It is remarkable now in an epoch of almost universal progress how stagnant the British privately owned railways are. One travels now-a-days if anything with a decrease of comfort from the 1880 accommodation, because of the greater overcrowding; and there has been no general increase of speed, no increase in smooth running, no increase in immunity from accident now for quite a number of years. One travels in a dingy box of a compartment that is too ill-lit at night for reading and full of invincible draughts. In winter the only warmth is too often an insufficient footwarmer of battered tin, for which the passengers fight fiercely with their feet. An observant person cannot fail to be struck--especially if he is returning from travel upon the State railways of Switzerland or Germany--by the shabby-looking porters on so many of our lines--they represent the standard of good clothing for the year 1848 or thereabouts--and by the bleak misery of many of the stations, the universal dirt that electricity might even now abolish. You dare not drop a parcel on any British railway cushion for fear of the cloud of horrible dust you would raise; you have to put it down softly. Consider, too, the congested infrequent suburban trains that ply round any large centre of population, the inefficient goods and parcel distribution that hangs up the trade of the local shopman everywhere. Not only in the arrested standard of comfort, but in the efficiency of working also are our privately owned railways a hopeless discredit to private ownership.|$|E

50|$|Seemingly, {{the first}} person to use peak debt in {{relation}} to house prices was Michael McNamara.

50|$|Hawtrey {{analysed}} {{the demand}} for money in terms of motives. He identifies a transaction demand, a precautionary demand, and a residual demand which reflects a gradual accumulation of savings balances.

The interest forgone is the main costs of holding money balances, and thus {{he points to a}} balancing process between costs and advantages in determining desired balances. The introduction of a banking system into the model allows agents to substitute <b>borrowing</b> <b>power</b> for money balances (Hawtrey, 1919, pp. 36-7).|$|E

This advantage would be {{due to the fact that}} postponing default until mid-March would allow for a triple deadline to be in March: the sequester on March 1, the default in the middle of the month, and the expiration of the current continuing resolution and the resulting federal government shutdown on March 27. This was supposed to provide extra pressure on the Senate and the President to work out a deal with the Republican-led House.|$|E

5000|$|In 1987, Cimino {{attempted}} to make an epic saga about the 1920s Irish rebel Michael Collins, but the film had to be abandoned due to budget, weather and script problems.

Cimino's representative added that the film was [...] "about the San Fernando Valley and the friendship between two guys" [...] and [...] "more intimate" [...] than Cimino's previous big-budget work like Heaven's Gate and the yet-to-be-released The Sicilian.

50|$|The {{player can}} {{increase}} the power of attacks by <b>borrowing</b> <b>power</b> from elemental spirits in a process called Seirei Combo (extra=spirit combo). To use a spirit combo, the player must summon an elemental spirit, and use magic of the same element in the following turns to release vast amounts of damage. Attack power is doubled per spirit present, meaning 2 spirits would create 4 times as much damage, and 3 spirits would create 8 times as much. The maximum combo (7 spirits) yields 128 times as much damage. The power of basic magic can surpass that of advanced magic if the player uses this combo. However, certain special rules apply to its use. For instance, the enemy can summon spirits of a stronger element to eliminate the combo's effectiveness (having one fire elemental spirit will eliminate the effect of one wind elemental spirit), and spirits can be extracted from the field using certain spells. The combo also applies for bombs which contain the magic power of an element. The maximum number of spirits that can be summoned is 7 (regardless of how many spirits were present {{at the start of}} the battle), and spirits must be re-summoned per combo use.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the main challenges that rural school districts face in school facilities funding and illustrates these problems, {{with a case}} study of Arkansas. Most rural school districts serve {{only a small number of}} students, which tends to limit the funds available for construction or renovation. In addition, rural districts are likely to have lower assessed property values and lower resident ability to support local taxes. In Arkansas, the per-student amount that a district could borrow for school facilities funding was three times larger for the state's largest school district than the smallest school district. The smallest district had 78 percent of its students participating in the free and reduced lunch program, an indication of resident inability to support additional taxes. The total <b>borrowing</b> <b>power</b> of districts ranged from $ 531, 000 to $ 363 million. When facilities funding is based on local property wealth and local ability to pay, great inequities occur. In 1994, 15 states provided no state school facilities funding, and 8 of those states measured local fiscal capacity by assessed property valuations. Either state or federal aid would help remedy inequities in facilities funding. Six data tables provide details on the states ' facilities funding and classification of local fiscal capacity and on Arkansas districts ' <b>borrowing</b> <b>power</b> by size, rurality, and poverty rate.
