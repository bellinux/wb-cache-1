5|$|The British <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new {{permanent}} {{approach was}} needed {{to establish and maintain}} continuous contact with the Peshwa's court in Pune. The British appointed Charles Malet, a senior merchant from Bombay, to be a permanent Resident at Pune because of his knowledge of the languages and customs of the region.|$|E
5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.|$|E

5|$|Another elite unit {{would be}} the Black Guard, a 25-man guerrilla unit under a certain Lieutenant García. García, one of Luna's favorites, was a modest but brave soldier. His unit was tasked to {{approach}} the enemy by surprise and quickly return to camp. Luna had admired García's unit very much {{that he wanted to}} increase their size. However, García declined the offer. He <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> larger force might undermine the efficiency of their work. Jose Alejandrino, the chief army engineer and one of Luna's aides, stated that he never heard of García and his unit again after Luna's resignation on February 28.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in {{accordance}} with the political strategy, Minh's junta was reluctant to carry out large-scale offensives, which concerned the Americans, particularly Harkins, Taylor and CIA chief John McCone. While Harkins and Taylor had opposed Diệm's ouster, the junta's policies also disappointed many supporters of the anti-Diệm coup as they saw regime change as necessary to their hopes of a more aggressive anti-communist war. For their part, Minh's leadership group <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> more low-key military approach was needed for their political campaign against the insurgency.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{uncertainty}} at quarterback, Michigan {{entered the}} 1997 {{season with a}} solid group of receivers, including Tai Streets and Russell Shaw, as well as returning All-Big Ten tight end Jerame Tuman. Analysts <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> solid season {{by any of the}} Michigan quarterbacks could lead to a productive season in the passing game. Moreover, it was anticipated that Charles Woodson, who was {{regarded as one of the}} most versatile athletes in college football, would play on offense.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{extensive}} coastal defences erected by the Germans {{to protect the}} installation from a seaborne raid, it was <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the garrison at the installation to destroy the Würzburg radar set. It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation {{would be the most}} practicable way to surprise the garrison of the installation, seize the technology intact, and minimise casualties to the raiding force.|$|E
5|$|During the Song Dynasty, Beiyue Temple {{was used}} as an {{alternate}} site to make sacrifices to the Northern Peak, Mount Heng, one of the sacred mountains of Daoism. During this time, Mount Heng was controlled by the Liao Dynasty (916-1125). In order to maintain political legitimacy and receive Daoist support, Beiyue Temple was chosen by the Song Emperor as the location to make sacrifices to Hengshan. Even though the mountain was not controlled by the Song, they <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> 'geomantic vein' that would direct their sacrifices could be cut through enemy-controlled territory and reach it.|$|E
5|$|Harper was an {{accomplished}} scholar (Semiticist) {{and a member}} of the Baptist clergy who <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> great university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus, to prepare students for careers in teaching and research and ministers for service to the church and community. As per this commitment, he brought the University of Chicago's Seminary to Hyde Park which had remained continually in operation after the loss of the Bronzeville campus through the Baptist Theological Union in Morgan Park. This became the Divinity School in 1891, the first professional school at the University of Chicago.|$|E

5|$|In April 1849, the Ipswich Express and Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper {{reported}} on a case in a village near to Rayleigh in which a girl had been afflicted with fits. Her family <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> witch was to blame, with Murrell being called in to free her of the perceived bewitchment. He commissioned the local blacksmith to create an iron witch bottle, into which he placed toe-nail clippings and locks of hair belonging to the putative victim. The bottle was then placed into the hearth and heated until it exploded, with this supposedly defeating the witch's machinations.|$|E
5|$|In Moscow, Kennan again {{felt that}} his {{opinions}} were being ignored by Harry S. Truman and policymakers in Washington. Kennan tried repeatedly to persuade policymakers to abandon plans for {{cooperation with the}} Soviet government {{in favor of a}} sphere of influence policy in Europe to reduce the Soviets' power there. Kennan <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> federation needed to be established in western Europe to counter Soviet influence in the region and to compete against the Soviet stronghold in eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|It {{was then}} <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Saxon town known as Alvertune developed. In Pierre de Langtoft's history of King Alfred {{he writes that}} in 865 it {{was the site of}} a number of battles between King Elfrid and his brother Alfred and five Danish kings and a similar number of earls. Later, in the 10th century, Danes settled at Romanby and Brompton. A fine example of English stonecarving from the period, the Brompton Hogbacks, can be found in Brompton Parish Church.|$|E

5|$|Reformers {{reasoned}} that adequate housing could counter the drinking problems. George Pullman adhered to this idea. He <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> good residential surrounding would benefit {{the workers and}} that beauty in the town would breed good character in the residents. Pullman hoped the comfortable, beautiful environment of his town would encourage cleanliness, industriousness and sobriety in the work force. Attractive housing with adequate living space did create good work habits in the towns.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{urticaria}} can {{be difficult}} to diagnose, but its presence can be confirmed by the process of phototesting. There are several forms of these tests including photopatch tests, phototests, photoprovocation tests, and laboratory tests. All of these are necessary to determine the exact infliction that the patient is suffering from. Photopatch tests are patch tests conducted when it is <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> patient is experiencing certain symptoms due to an allergy that will only occur when in contact with sunlight. After the procedure, the patient is given a low dosage of UVA radiation.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} was conceived by Edward Stratemeyer, {{founder of the}} Stratemeyer Syndicate. Stratemeyer had created the Hardy Boys series in 1926 (although the first volumes were not published until 1927), which {{had been such a}} success that he decided on a similar series for girls, featuring an amateur girl detective as the heroine. While Stratemeyer <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> woman's place was in the home, he was aware that the Hardy Boys books were popular with girl readers and wished to capitalize on girls' interest in mysteries by offering a strong female heroine.|$|E

5|$|To {{expand his}} power, Napoleon used these {{assassination}} plots {{to justify the}} creation of an imperial system based on the Roman model. He <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Bourbon restoration would be more difficult if his family's succession was entrenched in the constitution. Launching yet another referendum, Napoleon was elected as Emperor of the French by a tally exceeding 99%. As with the Life Consulate two years earlier, this referendum produced heavy participation, bringing out almost 3.6 million voters to the polls.|$|E
5|$|According to the Suda, the Catalogue {{was five}} books long. The length of each is unknown, {{but it is}} likely that the entire poem {{consisted}} of anywhere from 4000 to over 5000 lines. The majority of the content was structured around major genealogical units: the descendants of Aeolus were found in book 1 and at least part of book 2, followed by those of Inachus, Pelasgus, Atlas and Pelops in the later books. It is <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> rough guide to this structure can be found in the Bibliotheca, a Roman-era mythological handbook transmitted under the name of Apollodorus of Athens which used the Catalogue as a primary source for many genealogical details and appears to have followed reflect the poem's overall arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Augustine <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{physical}} Hell exists, {{but that}} physical punishment is {{secondary to the}} punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he believed that Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
