25|$|Folklorists today {{consider}} the 1920s the Soviet Union's {{golden age of}} folklore. The struggling new government, which had to focus its efforts on establishing a new administrative system and building up the nation's backwards economy, could not <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> attempting to control literature, so studies of folklore thrived. There were two primary trends of folklore study during the decade: the formalist and Finnish schools. Formalism focused on the artistic form of ancient byliny and faerie tales, specifically their use of distinctive structures and poetic devices. The Finnish school was concerned with connections amongst related legends of various Eastern European regions. Finnish scholars collected comparable tales from multiple locales and analyzed their similarities and differences, hoping to trace these epic stories’ migration paths.|$|E
500|$|He left CAI {{at the age}} of 18 {{and began}} a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in Jordanstown. He stayed at {{university}} for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, [...] "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There are other things to <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with,</b> like girls and football." [...] He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in Les Mains Sales at 4am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; [...] "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the minute I walked in. And I remember going to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'" [...] He graduated in 1987, {{at the age of}} 22.|$|E
2500|$|Drawing on his {{personal}} experience, Hazlitt narrows his focus still further by observing that [...] "Mr. Brougham speaks in a loud and unmitigated tone of voice, sometimes almost approaching to a scream. He is fluent, rapid, vehement, full of his subject, with evidently {{a great deal to}} say, and very regardless of the manner of saying it." [...] The very scope of his knowledge and interests, however, limits his abilities as a lawyer, as he cannot <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> small issues, preferring to focus on the broad issues affecting the world.|$|E

2500|$|When the {{development}} for the Telefunken main frame [...] began in 1965, Mallebrein and his team {{came up with the}} idea of [...] "reversing" [...] the existing [...] into a moveable mouse-like device, so that customers did not have to <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> mounting holes for the earlier trackball device. Together with light pens and trackballs, it was offered as an optional input device for their system since 1968. Some Rollkugel mouses installed at the [...] in Munich in 1972 are well preserved in a museum. Telefunken considered the invention too unimportant to apply for a patent on it.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{already been}} linked to his sister Adele on stage, Astaire was {{initially}} very reluctant {{to become part of}} another dance team. He wrote his agent, [...] "I don't mind making another picture with her, but as for this 'team' idea, it's 'out!' I've just managed to live down one partnership and I don't want to <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> any more." [...] However, he was persuaded by the obvious public appeal of the Astaire-Rogers pairing. The partnership, and the choreography of Astaire and Hermes Pan, helped make dancing an important element of the Hollywood film musical.|$|E
2500|$|Penn faced serious {{problems}} in the colonies due to his sloppy business practices. Apparently, he could not <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> administrative details, and his business manager, fellow Quaker Philip Ford, embezzled substantial sums from Penn's estates. Ford capitalised on Penn's habit of signing papers without reading them. One such paper {{turned out to be}} a deed transferring ownership of Pennsylvania to Ford who then demanded a rent beyond Penn's ability to pay. After Ford's death in 1702, his wife, Bridget, had Penn thrown in debtors' prison, but her cruelty backfired. It was unthinkable to have such a person govern a major colony, and in 1708 the Lord Chancellor ruled that [...] "the equity of redemption still remained in William Penn and his heirs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} queer--you know--these last few days, but no pain." [...] He struck his broad chest several times, {{cleared his throat}} with a {{powerful}} [...] "Hem!" [...] and repeated: [...] "No. No pain. Good {{for a few years}} yet. But I <b>am</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> all this, I can tell you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you s'pose Anne {{will ever}} get married now?" [...] speculated Davy anxiously. [...] "When Dorcas Sloane got married last summer she said if she'd had enough money to live on she'd never have <b>been</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> a man, but even a widower with eight {{children}} was better'n living with a sister-in-law." ...|$|R

2500|$|Adjacent to Studio B was a {{reverberation}} room containing a plate reverb device made by EMT, German makers of similar effects units installed in other recording studios around the world. The EMT reverb was an electro-mechanical echo chamber used to add artificial reverberation effects to recordings. Porter {{arranged to have}} the dedicated echo room cooled down {{as much as possible}} with an air conditioner, and he adjusted the ten springs on the EMT plate to be tighter than usual, in order to feed the plate more audio signal and get a cleaner sound returning from the device. So much signal was being sent to the plate that Porter disconnected the associated VU meter so that he would not <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> its needle slamming against its peg. Porter related that the EMT's springs frequently broke under the increased tension, and he would have to replace them, but that the trouble was worth achieving a [...] "brighter and fuller" [...] echo effect.|$|E

60|$|Biddy, the {{favourite}} {{of the two}} girls, {{had once}} or twice asked her mistress what ailed her, and whether she was ill; but Feemy only answered her crossly that she <b>was</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> that horrid headache, and the girl could only believe that either this was actually the case, or else that she had quarrelled with her lover; and as it was now three days since {{he had been at}} Ballycloran, she at last determined that this was the case.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonder if old Josiah Crabtree has <b>been</b> <b>bothering</b> her <b>with</b> his attentions?" [...] {{came from}} Tom. [...] "Gosh! how anxious {{he was to}} marry her and get hold of the money she is holding in trust for Dora." ...|$|R
6000|$|She bent her strange eyes on him. [...] "No, you're all too queer together. We couldn't <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> you and you're {{not worth}} it." ...|$|E

50|$|Coach Miguel Ángel Lotina {{stated that}} Guardado {{was a key}} player for Deportivo, and admired his talent and character. He {{solidified}} himself as first-choice for the team, providing several assists and being charged with set pieces; he <b>was</b> also <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> several injuries, however.|$|R
40|$|An 82 -year-old male {{suffered}} from prostatic cancer five years ago. Since then, {{he has taken}} flutamide and <b>was</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> episodic vertigo (EV) every morning. In order to treat prostatic cancer, flutamide was not discontinued, but conservative treatment and life-style change were recommended. Finally, EV actually subsided. Herein, we report the rare case, in which EV was an unexpected side effect of flutamide. Herein we review his whole history, physical examination, vestibular function test, electronystagmogram, caloric test, awake encephalogram, blood examinations, color-coded duplex ultrasonogram and magnetic resonance imaging/angiogram to suggest a mechanism of flutamide responsible for EV...|$|R
50|$|When {{he wakes}} up, {{he realizes he}} still loves his ex-wife. He goes to the room where she is staying to hug her, when Agnes and Chris {{suddenly}} come in. Agnes, feeling betrayed, breaks off the engagement, despite Lincoln's attempts to explain the situation. Ina, who had got back her voice when Lincoln softened up, announces she is {{fed up with the}} love triangle as well and storms out. She soon returns, however, and is told by Chris that Lincoln <b>is</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> functional euphonia too. He regains his voice to tell Ina he loves her and, in the end, they kiss.|$|R

6000|$|I {{hastened to}} say that he could reach Glenora two or three days in advance of us, for the reason that we <b>were</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> a lame horse. In reality, we were getting very short of {{provisions}} and were even then on rations. [...] "I think you'll overtake the Borland outfit," [...] I said. [...] "If you don't, and you need help, camp by the road till we come up and we'll all share as long as there's anything to share. But you are in good trim and have as much grub as we have, so you'd better spin along." ...|$|R
60|$|June 19.--Scribbled away lustily. Went to the P.H. Wrote when I came home, {{both before}} and after dinner--that's all, I think. I am become a sort of writing automaton, and truly the joints of my knees, {{especially}} the left, are so stiff and painful in rising and sitting down, that I can hardly help screaming--I that was so robust and active; I get into a carriage with great difficulty. My head, too, <b>is</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> rheumatic headaches. Why not? I got headaches by my folly when I was young, and now I am old they come uncalled. Infirmity gives what indiscretion bought.|$|R
50|$|Lincoln {{contacts}} {{his friend}} Chris Bartlett, hoping {{he will be}} able to romance Ina. He sets up a date between the two, but Ina shows no interest in Chris, only able to think of Lincoln. Later that night, Ina is able to break through Lincoln's wall, convincing him to spend the night with her. They enjoy a dinner at a restaurant where they are spotted by some of Agnes' friends. On their way back home, Ina again attempts to seduce him. Although Lincoln does not reply to her, he seems to have softened up. That night, Lincoln <b>is</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>with</b> a nightmare in which Ina is killed.|$|R
