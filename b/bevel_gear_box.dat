50|$|The United States Navy {{purchased}} 12 Schwartzkopff torpedoes in 1898, this naval service's one {{and only}} acquisition of the Schwartzkopff product. As delivered to the United States Navy, the Schwartzkopff torpedo was constructed in eight sections: war nose, warhead, immersion chamber, air flask, engine room, after body, <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> and tail. However, it was typically dismantled and assembled into four parts: the head, immersion chamber, air flask and after body. All the sections were manufactured out of bronze with the air flask made of a special grade to withstand the internal pressure of 90 atmospheres per square inch.|$|E
50|$|The first Boss Hosses offered {{included}} a one-speed manual transmission {{with a standard}} motorcycle hand clutch assisted by a Datsun B210 brake vacuum booster. The bikes used a standard ten-spline 12 in disc clutch plate hooked to a Curtis spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> with a Chevrolet input shaft and a -inch output shaft that had an attached sprocket. The first bikes were chain driven but changed to 1.5 in Dayton belts in the early 1990s. The ratio of the gear box used was 1.53:1. In 1999, a one-speed semi-automatic transmission was available for the motorcycles that utilized a torque converter and a pump {{with a set of}} clutch plates and steels basically added to the previous design gearbox, which worked very well. In 2001, a two-speed semi-automatic transmission with overdrive became standard with a heel-toe shifter and a reverse gear. Boss Hoss trikes have always offered a three-speed semi-automatic transmission with a real reverse gear.|$|E

A single wide casing housed the differential and transfer box, with four articulated driveshafts running to <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> inboard of each wheel. The use of bevel boxes, rather than DAF's worm gears, required the final drive reduction {{to be placed in}} the hubs, using an epicyclic reduction in each hub. This had the advantage of reducing torque in the driveshafts, allowing their unsprung weight to be made lighter.|$|R

One of {{the main}} {{problems}} with the operation of spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> is related to very severe conditions in the contact of the meshing teeth; therefore, lubrication is very difficult, which {{increases the risk of}} scuffing occurrence.
