500|$|In the mid-1850s, Evans and Foster visited Scotland {{to create}} {{sketches}} {{for a series}} of guide books, which Evans printed. He later engraved Foster's illustrations for Lady of the Lake, and Foster's illustrations for The Poetical Works of George Herbert (1856), printed in Edinburgh. Of the George Herbert engravings he states: [...] "these illustrations I consider the <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ever engraved". By 1856 Evans had [...] "perfected a process of colour printing from wood blocks", and achieved a reputation as the preeminent wood engraver and best colour printer in London.|$|E
500|$|Holliday's {{favorite}} player {{growing up}} was Cal Ripken, Jr. [...] He {{has stated that}} if he had a dream car it would be a Bentley Continental GT, rather than a sports car, because he is [...] "too big for small sports cars." [...] He is a Christian and is part of a Bible study group with fellow Christian teammates. [...] He has spoken about his faith saying, [...] "I play for God. [...] It says in the Bible that we are to do all things for Him. ... So I try to do the <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can for Him. [...] This is my job, not who I am." [...] Leslee has led a Bible study in the St. Louis area for professional athletes' wives.|$|E
500|$|By {{the middle}} of June, Pekka had {{recorded}} vocals for five tracks, which Antti described as [...] "very raw ... {{the way we want}} them to be". Pekka's vocals would continue to be recorded in August, and he completed them on August 20. Antti had also completed his guitar solos by June and was pleased with the results. [...] "For me, the solos are [...] <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have ever managed to create, and I'm very satisfied." [...] After a summer break, the band returned to record Sneck's keyboards, which took place over three days, August 17–19. Sneck worked with software effects for the first time, along with sound modules. He introduced synthesized horns to the band's instrumentation, but an actual trumpet was used for the intro to [...] "Rust Never Sleeps".|$|E

500|$|The {{cancelled}} {{journey was}} the beginning of the end. A crying, defiant Bosse went off by herself to the seaside resort Hornbæk in Denmark, a much shorter trip, but to her senses, a delightfully refreshing one. [...] There, she was soon followed by Strindberg's letters, full of agonized remorse at having given her pain, and then by Strindberg himself, steeling himself to bear the social life Bosse relished. However, the relationship quickly foundered on jealousy and suspicion, as when Strindberg struck a photographer over the head with his stick, unable to endure any attention to Bosse. In August, when Bosse discovered that she was pregnant, even Strindberg's delight (he was a fond parent of the four children of his previous marriages) could not save a marriage full of distrust and accusation. [...] This was illustrated in Strindberg's increasingly frantic letters to Bosse When their daughter Anne-Marie was born on 25 March 1902, they were already living apart. [...] "For the sake of us both it is <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not return", wrote Bosse in a letter to Strindberg. [...] "A continuation of life together with suspicion of every word, every act of mine, would be the end of me." [...] At her insistence, Strindberg began divorce proceedings.|$|E

2500|$|Foo Fighters {{frontman}} Dave Grohl {{joined the}} grunge group Nirvana as its drummer in 1990. During tours, {{he took a}} guitar with him and wrote songs. Grohl held back these songs {{from the rest of}} the band; he said in 1997, [...] "I was in awe of , and [...] intimidated. I thought it was <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> kept my songs to myself." [...] Grohl occasionally booked studio time to record demos and covers of songs he liked and even issued a cassette of some of those songs called Pocketwatch under the pseudonym [...] "Late!" [...] in 1992.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{a period}} of decades, Bartlett has weighed the {{question}} whether psychotherapy is truly effective. In 1987, his book When You Don’t Know Where to Turn: A Self-Diagnosing Guide to Counseling and Therapy was published and subsequently adopted by the Psychology Today Book Club and the Psychotherapy Book Club. The book presents a self-diagnosing algorithm to help readers identify, based on effectiveness studies, potentially most promising forms of therapeutic care. The algorithm takes into account individual symptoms, circumstances, personality, and life goals. The book {{was followed by the}} publication of the author's summary appraisal of the effectiveness of psychotherapy, about which psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, a long-time critic of psychiatry, commented: [...] "It is one of the best, if not the <b>best,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have read on this subject." [...] Similarly, psychologist Hans H. Strupp, who has extensively studied the effectiveness of psychotherapy, commented: [...] "I find myself in substantial agreement with [...] major points which are well stated." ...|$|E

2500|$|The next {{reference}} to this circuit board fragment was on September 15, 1989, when Alan Feraday of DERA sent a Polaroid photograph {{of it to}} the police officer leading the investigation, Detective Chief Inspector William Williamson, asking for help in identification and with a covering note saying this was [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can do in such a short time". In June 1990, Feraday and DCI Williamson were said to have visited FBI headquarters in Washington and, together with Thomas Thurman, an FBI explosives expert, identified the fragment as coming from a type of timer circuit board similar to the one in the timer that had been seized from a Libyan intelligence agent, Mohammad al-Marzouk, who had been arrested in Dakar airport, Senegal ten months before PA 103 (The Independent, December 19, 1990). Marzouk was found to be carrying [...] of Semtex, several packets of TNT, 10 detonators, and an electronic timer—a so-called MST-13 timer—with the word Mebo printed on it. DERA's timer fragment, which was subsequently designated as PT/35(b), would eventually lead detectives via its Swiss manufacturer to Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.|$|E
2500|$|Small in stature, {{he lacked}} the overall power of his larger {{competitors}} such as Don Budge and Kramer but made up for it with brains, ball control, and speed. A master court strategist and tactician, he worked his opponent out of position and scored points with the game's best drop shot and lob as well as punishing ground strokes that let him come to the net for put-away shots. [...] Kramer, {{one of the very}} few players who was undeniably better than Riggs, writes that there is a major [...] "misconception" [...] about Riggs. [...] "He didn't play some rinky-dink Harold Solomon style, pitty-pattying the ball around on dirt. [...] He didn't have the big serve, but he made up for it with some sneaky first serves and as fine a second serve as I had seen at that time. [...] When you talk about depth and accuracy both, Riggs' second serve ranks with the other three <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ever saw: von Cramm's, Gonzales's, and Newcombe's." [...] In his own autobiography, Riggs wrote, [...] "In the 1946 match with Budge , I charged the net at every opportunity. [...] Employing what I called my secret weapon, a hard first serve, I attacked constantly during my 6–3, 6–1, 6–1 victory." ...|$|E
