30|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>bridging</b> <b>pensions</b> did not extend the scale of early retirement schemes. Rather the opposite. This {{was a way to}} protect the withdrawal of the schemes. The way <b>bridging</b> <b>pensions</b> were defined (labour medical) and their clear cost meant that the number of potential cases was roughly 1 / 10 th of the previously possible early retirement schemes 36. Moreover, early retirement was conditional on additional contributions paid earlier by employers. The entire scheme was temporal covering only those workers who had started working in special conditions or in a special capacity before 1999. The law on <b>bridging</b> <b>pensions</b> is commonly referred to as the most important achievement of the government during the term 2007 - 2011.|$|R

3000|$|... 36 That {{cannot be}} {{precisely}} calculated since {{the number of}} people previously entitled to early retirement was not known (it was just estimated) and the number of <b>bridging</b> <b>pensions</b> would depend on many factors that were difficult to predict in advance.|$|R
30|$|The {{increase}} in the retirement age – even if not contested in 1999 – was very abrupt. In order to avoid ex-post protests, the concept of <b>bridging</b> <b>pensions</b> was developed. It {{was part of the}} entire project of reform implemented in the late 1990 s. The termination of early retirement schemes was legislated together with the entire reform bill package. However, the legislation did not include regulations on how the <b>bridging</b> <b>pensions</b> would be organised and financed. That legislation gap was not filled during the 10 years after adoption of the basic law bills. Politicians were afraid of touching that issue again, and this led to problems because the final date by which all early retirement schemes were to be terminated was 2006. Politicians twice postponed that date by one year.|$|R
30|$|However, {{the current}} {{government}} (2012) has gone even further, progressively increasing and equalising the minimum retirement age to 67 for both genders 46. The effects of that increase will come step by step over the next twenty years. There is however one immediate effect. It is pushing {{the issue of the}} <b>bridging</b> <b>pensions</b> out of the political agenda, as well as the previous increase of the actual retirement age that exchanged the statutory 60 / 65 for the minimum 60 / 65 retirement age (women/men).|$|R
30|$|The {{problem was}} {{eventually}} solved {{at the end}} of 2008 when the law on <b>bridging</b> <b>pensions</b> was finally passed through Parliament. Passing the law through Parliament was not easy but finally successful. The law had been vetoed by the President and sent back to Parliament where it was voted on again. Fortunately one opposition party, namely SLD, joined the ruling coalition causing the President’s veto to be overruled. The law became effective from the beginning of 2009 and totally changed the pension landscape in Poland.|$|R

30|$|Miners {{were also}} {{covered by the}} new system in 1999. The miners went on strike to prevent being covered, but were not successful. That was a great achievement. In 2005 the miners acted again and chose a very {{delicate}} moment. Two elections were scheduled for the same year (even the same part of that year), namely the presidential elections and parliamentary elections. Miners’ riots in Warsaw frightened politicians enough to eventually accept all their demands. The most important was to withdraw them from the public system. The key argument the miners stressed was {{the absence of the}} promised law on <b>bridging</b> <b>pensions.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{pension reform}} project “Security through Diversity” assumed the same minimum {{retirement}} age {{for men and}} women at 62. That was not accepted by politicians in 1999. Actually that was the only initial failure of the reform project at that time. The retirement age stayed at 60 / 65; women/men. Although at first sight nothing had changed, it was a radical increase in the actual retirement age. In the old system that age was a statutory age, a milestone, while in the new system it became the minimum age. That meant an increase of the actual age by 5 years for both genders. In order to have that radical change implemented in practice, the already discussed law on <b>bridging</b> <b>pensions</b> was necessary.|$|R
6000|$|And why?--because {{it brings}} self-approbation; [...] Whereas the other, after all its glare, [...] Shouts, <b>bridges,</b> arches, <b>pensions</b> from a nation, [...] Which (it may be) has not much left to spare, [...] A higher title, or a loftier station, [...] Though they may make Corruption gape or stare, [...] Yet, in the end, except in Freedom's battles, [...] Are {{nothing but a}} child of Murder's rattles.|$|R
30|$|We base our {{analysis}} on the Polish labour market. This choice stems {{from a number of}} reasons. Participation rates among persons aged 55 + in Poland are on average low compared to demographic characteristics observed in Europe in the twenty-first century. 5 In Poland, there is a so-called minimum retirement age. 6 It is the earliest age at which a worker can retire. Employers may not lay off workers when they reach the retirement age. A worker may sue an employer for being fired above the minimum retirement age. 7 The present value of paid contributions and the age at which the retiree starts receiving the payment determine the value of the old-age benefits. This amount reduces or even negates the level of tax on continued work. These regulations were implemented with the pension reform of 1999. However, the effective phasing of them started in 2009. Thus, these legal conditions have just begun to affect the situation in the Polish labour market. 8 They have not become strong factors behind retirement decisions yet, but data show a recent increase in participation rates and the actual retirement age in Poland (see Eurostat). 9 However, for {{our analysis}}, a legacy of the previous arrangements strongly matters. Until the new pension system was introduced (1999), it had been relatively easy to retire early in Poland. Average actual retirement age in the mid- 1990 s was roughly 55  years for women and 59 for men—irrespective to its formal level being 60 / 65.10 Although early retirement schemes are much less available now, some occupational groups (miners, uniform services, judges and prosecutors) can still enjoy them. The other groups in certain cases can apply for the so-called pre-retirement benefit (a kind of open-ended unemployment benefit that does not require any job search). The 2008 withdrawal of the early retirement schemes was made less drastic through implementation of <b>bridging</b> <b>pensions</b> that are temporal, difficult to obtain, not very generous and paid by employers. This has strongly reduced availability of early retirement for the future, but this did not wipe out the effects of previous arrangements, namely workers prematurely leaving the labour market.|$|R
