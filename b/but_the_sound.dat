5|$|City {{officials}} {{scheduled a}} public celebration with free {{food and drink}} for the testing of the recast bell. When the bell was struck, it did not break, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> produced was described by one hearer as like two coal scuttles being banged together. Mocked by the crowd, Pass and Stow hastily took the bell away and again recast it. When {{the fruit of the}} two founders' renewed efforts was brought forth in June 1753, the sound was deemed satisfactory, though Norris indicated that he did not personally like it. The bell was hung in the steeple of the State House the same month.|$|E
5|$|At 18:42 on 10 November 1808, the {{garrison}} of a French defensive gun battery {{on the island}} of Groix saw a frigate moving rapidly westwards. As they had not been informed of any French movements at that time, the battery fired two warning shots at the ship to establish her identity. The frigate, Thétis, replied with her recognition signal and the firing stopped, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> had attracted the attention of HMS Amethyst, then approaching Groix from the west. Within a few minutes, Seymour's lookouts had spotted the French frigate and Amethyst immediately gave chase. Pinsum followed his orders to avoid combat and made all sail south-west, intending to escape into the Atlantic. By 21:00, Amethyst was close enough to fire her bow-chasers, small guns positioned {{at the front of the}} ship, at the French frigate and was attacked in turn from the French stern chasers. Certain that his quarry was an enemy, Seymour launched signal rockets in the hope of attracting attention from other ships of the inshore squadron that might intercept the French ship, and he received answering flashes from the north-east as Captain Sir Thomas Hardy joined the chase in HMS Triumph.|$|E
5|$|Once {{he moved}} to Nutting, Bushnell took over the {{majority}} of the engineering work for the game; Dabney has stated that he advised Bushnell on some of the design, and that some of the construction was done by Steve Bristow, an intern at Ampex. There is disagreement in interviews with Bushnell and Dabney as to how much work Dabney did on the final cabinet, with Dabney claiming credit for the controls, sound, power supply, initial wooden cabinet, and invention of the hyperspace color inversion, while Bushnell claims credit for everything <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound,</b> cabinet, power supply, and monitor. By August 1971, an initial prototype of the game—now named Computer Space to be similar to Computer Quiz—was complete, and Syzygy moved on to location testing. They installed the game at the Dutch Goose bar near Stanford University, where it met with great success. Nutting was heartened by the response and rushed to make several finished cabinets for the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition in October. Further location tests found a less enthusiastic response from customers confused by the game mechanics and controls, and Syzygy hurriedly tried to adjust the game to be more understandable to players.|$|E
5000|$|Each stanza in a canso has {{the same}} {{internal}} rhyme scheme; that is, if, say, the first line rhymes with the third in the first stanza, it will do so in every successive one. What varies {{is the relationship between}} rhymes in separate stanzas.When stanzas follow the same rhyming pattern <b>but</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>sounds</b> differ, they are called coblas alternadas (lit. [...] "alternated stanzas"). When <b>the</b> last rhyme <b>sound</b> of one cobla becomes the first of the next they are called coblas capcaudadas (lit. [...] "head-tailed"). When the last rhyme word of one stanza appears in the first line of the next they are called coblas capfinidas (lit. [...] "head-finished"). When the rhyming scheme and rhyming <b>sounds</b> are <b>the</b> same each stanza, they are coblas unissonans (lit. [...] "unison"). When the rhyming scheme never changes <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of each stanza are different they are coblas singulars (lit. [...] "singular"). When the rhyming scheme never changes <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> do every two stanzas it is called coblas doblas (lit. [...] "double"). When the rhyming scheme never changes <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> do every three stanzas it is called coblas ternas. When the rhymes change position in accordance with an algorithm they are called coblas retrogradadas (lit. [...] "retrograded").|$|R

5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E

25|$|Old Irish {{is known}} for having a {{particularly}} complex system of morphology and especially of allomorphy (more or less unpredictable variations in stems and suffixes in differing circumstances) {{as well as a}} complex sound system involving grammatically significant consonant mutations to the initial consonant of a word. Apparently, neither characteristic was present in the preceding Primitive Irish period. Much of the complex allomorphy was subsequently lost, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> system has been maintained with little change in the modern languages.|$|E

25|$|In new construction, minimum {{requirements}} are typically more stringent. All smoke detectors must be hooked {{directly to the}} electrical wiring, be interconnected and have a battery backup. In addition, smoke detectors are required either inside or outside every bedroom, depending on local codes. Smoke detectors on the outside will detect fires more quickly, assuming the fire does not begin in the bedroom, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the alarm will be reduced and may not wake some people. Some areas also require smoke detectors in stairways, main hallways and garages.|$|E
25|$|In the 1978–79 season, two {{changes were}} made. The series brought in choreographers Dennon Rawles and Jerri Fiala, {{the latter of}} whom was already working for show {{producer}} Ralph Edwards as hostess on The Cross-Wits, to serve as background dancers. In addition, the Name That Tune Orchestra was supplemented by The Sound System, a rock music ensemble led by Dan Sawyer with Steve March as its featured vocalist. The dancers were done away with after one season <b>but</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> System, along with March, stayed on {{for the rest of}} the show's run.|$|E
25|$|While many earlier sound films had dialogue, {{all were}} short subjects. D. W. Griffith's feature Dream Street (1921) {{was shown in}} New York with a single singing {{sequence}} and crowd noises, using the sound-on-disc system Photokinema. The film was preceded by a program of sound shorts, including a sequence with Griffith speaking directly to the audience, but the feature itself had no talking scenes. On April 15, 1923, Lee De Forest introduced the sound-on-film system Phonofilm, which had synchronized sound and dialogue, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> quality was poor, and the films produced in this process were short films only.|$|E

25|$|The {{researchers}} deduced {{that the}} fluctuating force was proportional to U2, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> power {{was found to}} vary from U4.5 to U6.0. If the measurement bandwidth is broad and the measurement distance {{is out of the}} near field, there are two dynamic factors (Strouhal number and dimensionless force), that can cause the exponent to be less than six. Both the Deltameter and hole tone data show the Strouhal number is a weak negative function of Reynolds number, which is squared in the sound power equation. This would result in a reduced speed exponent. This factor is not likely to explain the large reduction in exponent however.|$|E
25|$|Instruments made {{mostly from}} plastic, {{including}} the pBone and the Tromba plastic trombone, {{emerged in the}} 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass. Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> plastic instruments produce {{is different from that}} of brass. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players not wishing to invest so much money in a trombone right away. Manufacturers now produce large-bore models with triggers as well as smaller alto models.|$|E

Combined with Favors' resonant, grooving basslines and DeJohnette's loose straight-eighth rhythms the result is somewhat akin to Miles Davis in the In a Silent Way period." ...|$|R
500|$|The mixing was {{supposed}} to be overseen by the band members, but their schedule in October was so tight that Lawrence did it without them. This dismayed the band at first, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> turned out cleaner, heavier and more polished than on their debut. The tapes were mixed in both mono and stereo, but the mono tapes were trashed, as neither Tetragrammaton nor EMI, Deep Purple's British label, [...] had any use for them.|$|E
500|$|As is {{the case}} with most of the {{material}} on their previous two albums, the songs of Deep Purple mix elements of progressive rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock, but this time in a darker and more baroque atmosphere. Perhaps in response to British audiences craving more blues-based rock, the band also incorporated a 12-bar blues structure on the songs [...] "The Painter" [...] and [...] "Why Didn't Rosemary?" [...] "Emmaretta" [...] is a pop rock song written to be a commercial single, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the album is heavier and more guitar-oriented than previous works, similar to how the band sounded live during this period.|$|E
500|$|Its treble panel {{diaphragm}} {{is further}} subdivided into midrange and tweeter sections, achieved by clamping it {{on each side}} of its centre. Both midrange and tweeter sections are driven separately, and the entire treble unit operates at substantially lower voltages – operating voltages are said to be 6000V for the bass and 1500V for the treble. The speaker needs to be plugged into the mains and must be charged prior to use. This is because the diaphragm operates in a [...] "constant charge" [...] mode, and it takes time for the charge to build up. In practice, the speaker is usable after charging for less than half a minute, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> gradually improves as the charge builds up. Best performance is achieved when the speaker has charged fully, which can take up to an hour. The electricity is only to charge the diaphragm, so consumption is negligible.|$|E

500|$|Fallout 3 {{received}} universal acclaim, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. 1UP.com's Demian Linn praised its open-ended gameplay and flexible character-leveling system. While the V.A.T.S. system was called [...] "fun", enemy encounters {{were said to}} suffer {{from a lack of}} precision in real-time combat and little variety in enemy types. The review concluded, Fallout 3 is a [...] "hugely ambitious game that doesn't come around very often". IGN editor Erik Brudvig praised the game's [...] "minimalist" [...] sound design, observing, [...] "you might find yourself with nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of wind rustling through decaying trees and blowing dust across the barren plains ... Fallout 3 proves that less can be more". The review noted that the [...] "unusual amount of realism" [...] combined with the [...] "endless conversation permutations" [...] produces [...] "one of the most truly interactive experiences of the generation". In a review of the game for Kotaku, Mike Fahey commented that [...] "While Inon Zur's score is filled with epic goodness, the real stars of Fallout 3s music are the vintage songs from the 1940s".|$|E
500|$|The album {{had limited}} {{commercial}} success, reaching a peak position of No. 111 during a seven-week {{run on the}} US Billboard 200 album chart. Assessments of the album often weigh the poor sound quality against the historic importance and insight provided into The Beatles' early stage act. Rolling Stone reviewer John Swenson called the album [...] "poorly recorded but fascinating" [...] and commented that it showed The Beatles as [...] "raw but extremely powerful." [...] Allmusic, commenting on a reissue, wrote: [...] "The results were very low-fidelity, and despite The Beatles' enormous success, it took Taylor fifteen years to find someone greedy and shameless enough to release them as a record". Q Magazine described the recordings as having [...] "certain historical interest" [...] and remarked: [...] "The show seems like a riot <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> itself is terrible– like {{one hell of a}} great party going on next door." [...] George Harrison gave the assessment: [...] "The Star-Club recording was the crummiest recording ever made in our name!" ...|$|E
500|$|Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics, as it {{was then}} known, was {{performed}} in the presence of an assembled press on 17 February 1972 – {{more than a year before}} its release – at the Rainbow Theatre, and was critically acclaimed. Michael Wale of The Times described the piece as [...] "...bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning." [...] Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times wrote [...] "The ambition of the Floyd's artistic intention is now vast." [...] Melody Maker was, however, less enthusiastic: [...] "Musically, there were some great ideas, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London zoo." [...] However, the following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed live, in the same order in which it would eventually be recorded, but obvious differences between the live version, and the recorded version released a year later, included the lack of synthesizers in tracks such as [...] "On the Run", and Bible readings that were later replaced by Clare Torry's non-lexical vocables on [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky".|$|E
