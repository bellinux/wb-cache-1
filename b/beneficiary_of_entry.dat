40|$|The French Ministy of Labor {{launched}} a 2 -wave survey {{to evaluate a}} job-subsidies scheme that has been renovated in 2005. 7, 000 <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> this program were surveyed in 2008 and 2009, along with 6, 000 counterfactual individuals: they all registered during spring 2005 at the National Agency for Employment, and have similar observed characteristics. The beneficiaries were hired on a subsidized contract between 2005 and 2007, while the counterfactuals were not. The survey is designed to estimate causal impacts by matching, and hence the questionnaire includes relevant variables to capture unobserved heterogeneity : difficulties to find a job, self-assessed assets and weak spots on the job market, reading and speaking proficiency, health status, etc. These variables are usually not present in administrative datasets, and should {{improve the quality of}} matching estimations. This article presents the survey, and then studies career developments between 2005 and 2009 for the <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> the job-subsidies program. The last part analyses the determinants <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> into the program for the 4 types of contracts (CIE, CAE, CAV, CI-RMA), in order to realise a propensity score matching. job-subsidies scheme, career developments, causal impact, counterfactual, matching, propensity score...|$|R
