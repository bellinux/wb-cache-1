5|$|Captain Blackadder's trench {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from HQ: a full-scale attack has been ordered for the next day at dawn. Realising that this is likely to mean his death, Blackadder plans to escape by pretending to be mad: he puts underpants on his head and sticks pencils in his nostrils. His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to <b>Baldrick.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, who swapped {{computer}} disks to make edits. They stuck to a rule whereby they could not add back material the other had removed. The script was collaboratively edited by the cast members of Blackadder Goes Forth during read-throughs. Elton was primarily responsible for the sequence in which Blackadder explains how the First World War started; the running gag of <b>Baldrick</b> using mud and bodily fluids to make coffee throughout the episode was greatly expanded during rehearsals.|$|E
5|$|Blackadder Goes Forth is {{the fourth}} and final series of the BBC sitcom Blackadder, written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, which aired from 28 September to 2 November 1989 on BBC One. The series placed the {{recurring}} characters of Blackadder, <b>Baldrick</b> and George in a trench in Flanders during World War I, and followed their various doomed attempts {{to escape from the}} trenches to avoid certain death under the misguided command of General Melchett. The series is particularly noted for its criticism of the British Army leadership during the campaign, and also refers to a number of famous figures of the age. In addition, the series is remembered for the poignant ending of the final episode.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} set during the Elizabethan era (15581603). The {{principal}} character, Edmund, Lord Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), is the great-grandson {{of the original}} Black Adder, {{and is now a}} member of the London aristocracy. Unlike his forefather, he is both dashing and intelligent, although he is still scheming and cynical in his outlook. The series follows his attempts to win the favour of the childish Queen Elizabeth I (Miranda Richardson). As before he is aided, and often hindered, by two less-than-intelligent sidekicks, his servant <b>Baldrick</b> (Tony Robinson), and Lord Percy Percy (Tim McInnerny), heir to the Duchy of Northumberland, with whom Blackadder has a grudging friendship.|$|E
25|$|This <b>Baldrick</b> {{is also a}} poet, {{composing}} The German Guns. During {{his time}} in the trenches, <b>Baldrick</b> also wrote a second poem.|$|E

25|$|<b>Baldrick</b> is {{the name}} of several fictional {{characters}} featured in the long-running BBC historic comedy television series Blackadder. Each one serves as Edmund Blackadder's servant and sidekick and acts as a foil to the lead character. Each series of Blackadder is set in a different period in British history, and each <b>Baldrick</b> character (as with the character of Edmund) is a descendant of the <b>Baldrick</b> from the preceding series. Just as Blackadder exists in many incarnations throughout the ages, so does Baldrick; whenever there is a Blackadder there is a <b>Baldrick</b> serving him. They are all portrayed by Sir Tony Robinson (although in the unaired pilot episode he was played by Philip Fox).|$|E
25|$|The medieval <b>Baldrick</b> was {{probably}} the only <b>Baldrick</b> of the four who could really be described as clever. <b>Baldrick,</b> an ex-dung shoveller (a respected position, which he had {{worked very hard to}} get – earlier jobs include milking pigs and mucking out lepers) and Son of Robin the Dung Gatherer, first met Prince Edmund at the feast before the Battle of Bosworth Field and using flattery became his Squire. The two, along with Lord Percy, toasted their new friendship, unaware that from that point onwards, their descendants' lives would be eternally entwined.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Edmund and <b>Baldrick</b> evolves significantly; {{in the first}} series of the show, <b>Baldrick</b> is more intelligent than Blackadder, but this dynamic is reversed in subsequent series, with Baldrick's intelligence decreasing as the show continued. He is the only character other than Edmund Blackadder to appear in every episode of the programme.|$|E

25|$|Edmund and his friend, Lord Percy Percy, Duke of Northumberland, {{are joined}} by a servant <b>Baldrick,</b> who {{with a bit of}} flattery manages to win enough favour with Edmund to be chosen as his squire for the morning battle. The next day, both Edmund and <b>Baldrick</b> oversleep. Once woken by Edmund's mother, Gertrude of Flanders, they rush to the battlefield, Edmund by horse and <b>Baldrick</b> by mule. Edmund is {{initially}} eager to fight but, observing the combatants from afar, he comes to the realisation that fighting could lead to death. He decides at that moment to remain a spectator and then hides behind a bush to relieve himself.|$|E

25|$|In the Millennium special, S.Baldrick {{constructs}} a fake {{time machine}} from Leonardo da Vinci's sketches, despite {{his inability to}} read (combating this with his experience of constructing Airfix models). Baldrick's intelligence has risen {{to the level of}} the second <b>Baldrick</b> again and accidentally makes a real time machine. After a time-travel adventure, Lord Blackadder find England an extension of France, William Shakespeare having designed the ballpoint pen and no knowledge of Robin Hood whatsoever. Edmund takes all the things he gained on his journey (besides Elizabeth I's crown) and after another adventure, gets the idea to alter the timeline to become King. Predictably, <b>Baldrick</b> becomes his Prime Minister, finally becoming what he desired (as did Edmund) and is the second <b>Baldrick</b> to rise to upper class (although after Blackadder's alterations there may be more).|$|E

Worst of all, George accepts because he thought he might have been court martialled for disobeying a superior officer.|$|R

25|$|Private S. <b>Baldrick</b> (presumed dead 1917) is {{a private}} in a First World War trench, serving under Captain Blackadder and Lieutenant George. His hero is Lord Flashheart.|$|E
25|$|S. <b>Baldrick</b> {{also does}} a Charlie Chaplin {{impression}} (although some believe {{it to be}} a slug balancing act, and General Melchett mistook it for a feeble impression of Buster Keaton).|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} series, S.Baldrick has lost almost all {{intelligence}} and apparently has {{no desire to}} rise in social standing and claims in the first episode that his goal in life is the acquisition of turnips. Ironically, in the same episode, <b>Baldrick</b> is appointed to the House of Lords by Prince George and thus becomes upper class, {{one of the greatest}} achievements of the <b>Baldrick</b> family. He also haggles for a priceless turnip (£400,000). Baldrick's turnip is crushed by Blackadder later and presumably his titles were erased as in the following episodes, he is once more lower class.|$|E

25|$|Blackadder {{also claims}} that <b>Baldrick</b> has never changed his trousers, and implores him never to do so, for they are, Blackadder claims, akin to Pandora's Box, {{containing}} all {{the evils of}} the world.|$|E
25|$|Although cleverer {{than the}} Prince, <b>Baldrick,</b> knowing {{his place in}} the medieval pecking-order, holds him in awe. He often leads cheers in the Prince's honour (along with Lord Percy, who tries hard to join in), fills his head with illusions of grandeur, and often ends up doing his dirty work. This {{included}} carrying the decapitated body of Richard III and sleeping with the Spanish Infanta, Edmund's fiancée, making her unchaste in hopes that this would prevent the marriage. The latter task resulted in several injuries, including a seriously blackened eye. When <b>Baldrick</b> is abandoned by Edmund in the final episode, a tear falls from his eye.|$|E
