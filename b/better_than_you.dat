25|$|How can a man {{lose the}} Tour de France {{because of an}} {{accident}} to his bike? I can't understand it. The rule should be changed so that a rider with no chance of winning can give his bike to his leader, or {{there should be a}} car with several spare bicycles. You lose the Tour de France when you find someone <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are. You don't lose it through a stupid accident to your machine. Next year Desgrange modified the rules.|$|E

500|$|Williams was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of women in academia; according to Nussbaum, he was [...] "as close to being a feminist as a powerful man of his generation could be." [...] He was also famously sharp in conversation. Gilbert Ryle, one of Williams's mentors at Oxford, said that he [...] "understands what you're going to say <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> understand it yourself, and sees all the possible objections to it, and all the possible answers to all the possible objections, before you've got to the end of your own sentence." ...|$|E
500|$|Pitt {{took the}} role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It, {{directed}} by Robert Redford. His portrayal of the character was described by Peoples Janet Mock as a career-making performance, proving that Pitt could {{be more than a}} [...] "cowboy-hatted hunk." [...] He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film and thought it one of his [...] "weakest performances... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for." [...] Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying [...] "when you play with somebody <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> your game gets better." ...|$|E
500|$|Truman {{continues}} to sail until – {{to his surprise}} – his boat punctures {{the wall of the}} dome. He finds an exit door, but Christof, speaking directly to Truman through a speaker system, tries to convince him to stay, stating there is [...] "no more truth" [...] in the real world and [...] "I know you <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> know yourself", that he brings comfort to his audience and that by staying in his artificial world, he would have nothing to fear. Truman considers this, then states: [...] "You never had a camera in my head!" [...] and [...] "In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night," [...] previously his unwitting catch-phrase, takes a bow, and leaves. Watching the show at home, Sylvia races to meet Truman, while Christof's supervisors end the show for the last time and the audience starts looking for something else to watch.|$|E

500|$|In 1951 Greenleaf was {{transferred}} to a U.S. post from Haneda Air Base in Tokyo. He and Katsura, who spoke little English, set sail for the United States on the USS Breckinridge, debarking in San Francisco {{at the end of}} December 1951, just a few months before the 1952 World Three-Cushion Billiards tournament was scheduled to begin in that city on March 6. Katsura had been conditionally invited to play at the world championship after Cochran, whose billiard parlor was hosting the tournament, had heard of her brilliance from Matsuyama. Cochran was an 8-time world champion having won the world crown at three-cushion billiards in 1933, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1944 and 1945, and at 18.2 balkline, in 1927 and 1934. Cochran sent his son, W. R. (Dick) Cochran, a naval officer stationed in Japan, to investigate and received back a glowing report that said (possibly to Cochran's annoyance), [...] "this girl is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are!" [...] Though the decision was ultimately {{in the hands of the}} Billiard Congress of America as tournament sponsor, they gave Cochran the option to invite her.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Sorkin {{attended}} Syracuse University. In {{his freshman}} year he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback {{because he wanted to}} be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that [...] "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why a lot of us went to [...] 'You have the capacity to be so much <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year. He was still saying it in May. On the last day of classes, he said it again, and I said, 'How?', and he answered, 'Dare to fail'. I've been coming through on his admonition ever since".|$|E
500|$|Hobart was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the gold standard; and insisted on it remaining {{a major part of the}} Republican campaign even in the face of Bryan's surge. [...] In his speech responding to the formal notification of his convention victory, Hobart stated, [...] "An honest dollar, worth 100 cents everywhere, cannot be coined out of 53 cents worth of silver plus a legislative fiat. Such a debasement of our currency would inevitably produce incalculable loss, appalling disaster, and National dishonor." [...] McKinley was not as strong a supporter of the gold standard as Hobart, and considered modifying some of Hobart's expressed views on the gold standard before the acceptance was printed for public distribution. [...] Hobart insisted on it being printed without change, writing, [...] "I think I know the sentiment of Eastern men <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> can, and with this knowledge and my convictions I must retain the statements as I have written them." [...] According to Connolly, [...] "Though a protectionist, Hobart believed the money issue, not tariffs, led to a November Republican victory, and, in denouncing silver, his rhetoric far outstripped [...] William McKinley." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] {{was directed by}} Lohan in Chelsea, Manhattan, New York City, and references her father Michael's alcoholism and alleged domestic abuse. Tommy Mottola, head of Casablanca, revealed {{that no one could}} direct the video better than Lindsay herself, who said to Lohan, [...] "'No one knows this song <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> no one knows this situation better than you.' It's a lot to take on, but I told her she's ready, and we'll give her all the support she needs". Lohan said that the video's storefront setting was chosen because, in her words, [...] "my life is on display". Lohan also wanted to break a mirror during the bathroom scenes, because she wanted to show her real feelings in the video. Assistant director Jeb Bryan said to Lohan, [...] "This is real glass, Lindsay. We weren't prepared for you to break these things. [...] Do you want this slow motion?" [...] She responded, [...] "Regular frame will make it more violent. [...] I don't want it to be too pretty". The music video was first aired on MTV's Making the Video, and later released to iTunes Store on October 25, 2005.|$|E

2500|$|After the Vienna Award, the Hungarian {{government}} and United Hungarian Party together organized celebrations and a triumphant entry of the Hungarian army into the annexed territories.

A few days before the arbitration, Budapest also received messages from some of borderline villages refusing annexation by Hungary ("Stay there, do not liberate us.
