5|$|It has {{a unique}} method of {{capturing}} tent-making bats. It looks for roosting bats <b>by</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> their tents (which are made of a folded leaf). When it finds a bat it climbs {{to a higher level}} and jumps onto the tent from above, attempting to dislodge the bat. If the fallen bat does not fly away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground and eats it.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether {{remained}} in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelsonâ€“Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium <b>by</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> changes in {{the speed of light}} depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference.|$|E
5|$|The letters {{first learned}} by a child, {{commonly}} their own name, {{may come to}} have lasting positive associations. Hoorens and Todorova tested this <b>by</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their mother tongue alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman. Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, {{there should be no}} name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet. Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic. The researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not the principle cause of the name-letter effect. In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age as might be expected, they found it increased, thus proving that mastery pleasure is not the principal cause. They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet {{at the same time as}} the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later. They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet made no difference in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co-determinant.|$|E

25|$|Antimatter {{may exist}} in {{relatively}} large amounts in far-away galaxies due to cosmic inflation in the primordial {{time of the}} universe. Antimatter galaxies, if they exist, {{are expected to have}} the same chemistry and absorption and emission spectra as normal-matter galaxies, and their astronomical objects would be observationally identical, making them difficult to distinguish.

25|$|Lucero was {{designed}} so its transmission would be triggered {{more rapidly than}} the radar's magnetron.

This meant that the line segments began at a point indicating closer range than the aircraft sending the response, and ended after it. The radar operator could thus tell which aircraft was sending the IFF responses <b>by</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> blips roughly centred along the line segments.|$|E

25|$|The {{thyroid gland}} may become firm, large, and lobulated in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but {{changes in the}} thyroid can also be nonpalpable. Enlargement of the thyroid is due to {{lymphocytic}} infiltration and fibrosis rather than tissue hypertrophy. Physiologically, antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) (also called TPOAb) and/or thyroglobulin cause gradual destruction of follicles in the thyroid gland. Accordingly, the disease can be detected clinically <b>by</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> these antibodies in the blood. It is also characterized by invasion of the thyroid tissue by leukocytes, mainly T-lymphocytes. A rare but serious complication is thyroid lymphoma, generally the B-cell type, non-Hodgkin lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Li Xueqin has {{suggested}} that the board was used for divination by matching the day to be divined to the corresponding sexagenary term on the Liubo diagram, and then reading off the corresponding prognostication according to the position of the sexagenary term on the Liubo diagram. However, Lillian Tseng points out that the divination could also be done the other way round, <b>by</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the desired prognostication (for example an auspicious marriage day), and then all the days on the Liubo board that were written on the position corresponding to the term heading the prognostication would match the desired prognostication.|$|E
25|$|The behavioral-based {{approach}} to detecting rootkits attempts to infer {{the presence of}} a rootkit <b>by</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> rootkit-like behavior. For example, by profiling a system, differences in the timing and frequency of API calls or in overall CPU utilization can be attributed to a rootkit. The method is complex and is hampered by a high incidence of false positives. Defective rootkits can sometimes introduce very obvious changes to a system: the Alureon rootkit crashed Windows systems after a security update exposed a design flaw in its code. Logs from a packet analyzer, firewall, or intrusion prevention system may present evidence of rootkit behaviour in a networked environment.|$|E

25|$|The Tor {{anonymity}} {{network was}} and is subject to blocking by China's Great Firewall. The Tor website is blocked when accessed over HTTP but it is reachable over HTTPS so {{it is possible for}} users to download the Tor Browser Bundle. The Tor network maintains a public list of approximately 3000 relays which are almost all blocked. In addition to the public relays, Tor maintains so called bridges which are non-public relays. Their purpose is to help censored users reach the Tor network. The Great Firewall is dynamically blocking these bridges <b>by</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> their TLS fingerprint. According to a research paper published in April 2012, the block can be circumvented by using packet fragmentation or the Tor obfsproxy bundle in combination with private obfsproxy bridges. Psiphon is also used.|$|E
25|$|Expression {{profiling}} experiments often involve {{measuring the}} relative amount of mRNA expressed {{in two or}} more experimental conditions. This is because altered levels of a specific sequence of mRNA suggest a changed need for the protein coded by the mRNA, perhaps indicating a homeostatic response or a pathological condition. For example, higher levels of mRNA coding for alcohol dehydrogenase suggest that the cells or tissues under study are responding to increased levels of ethanol in their environment. Similarly, if breast cancer cells express higher levels of mRNA associated with a particular transmembrane receptor than normal cells do, {{it might be that}} this receptor plays a role in breast cancer. A drug that interferes with this receptor may prevent or treat breast cancer. In developing a drug, one may perform gene expression profiling experiments to help assess the drug's toxicity, perhaps <b>by</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> changing levels in the expression of cytochrome P450 genes, which may be a biomarker of drug metabolism. Gene expression profiling may become an important diagnostic test.|$|E
25|$|Although {{porpoising}} is {{a useful}} product of rapid swimming, a lot of variation seen in the behaviour cannot be explained by this cause alone; it has likely evolved to provide other functions. For example, the rotation during porpoising by the spinner dolphin leads to lots of splashing and is more common at slower speeds so cannot be attributed to an energy saving mechanism. It is therefore {{more likely to be}} a form of play or communication within or between pods. Another reason might be to remove barnacles or small sharks such as remoras that, when attached, increase drag during swimming. When spinner dolphins impact the water the combination of centrifugal and vertical force upon these ectoparasites can be up to 700 times their own weight and so efficiently remove them. Other theories suggest that cetaceans may porpoise in order to observe distant objects such as food <b>by</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> visual cues, such as birds dive-bombing a bait ball. Research into the additional functions of porpoising has so far been focussed on the more acrobatic species, but it is likely that other cetaceans also use it for these, and perhaps unknown, reasons too.|$|E

The in-laws meet again at the Shipman's house in Essex, where Nessa has some shocking revelationsâ€“ especially for Smithy, who learns that she is pregnant with his baby, and although he makes it clear he thoroughly dislikes the woman, he is generally civil and supportive towards her about their child. Meanwhile, Gavin and Stacey, living at Pam and Mick's house, run into trouble when Stacey struggles {{to find a job}} and becomes home-sick for Barry and her family. The couple try to overcome their problem <b>by</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> an apartment or house in Essex, but Stacey is still dissatisfied and is considering moving back to South Wales to be with her family. In the final episode of the series, Stacey takes off her wedding ring, much to the upset of Gavin, but this is interrupted by the news of Nessa unexpectedly going into labour a month early. Pam, Mick and Stacey hurry across to Wales, whilst Gavin rushes to find Smithy with Smithy's sister, Rudi (Sheridan Smith), eventually finding him in the pub watching football. They arrive to find that Nessa has given birth to a boy, Neil. Gavin and Stacey decide to put their differences aside and are together once again.|$|E
