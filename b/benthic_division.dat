40|$|Objectives: To {{obtain a}} check {{list of the}} {{attached}} algae and flowering plants associated with the marine environment in the Corpus Christi Bay area. Procedure: Vegetation was noted and samples collected in the field. Speci-mens were taken from periodically inundated salt flats and from submerged areas. A rake, dragged along the bottom, was used to obtain specimens from the <b>benthic</b> <b>division.</b> Collected specimens were preserved in bay water with 2 % formalin. Findings: The heaviest growth and greatest variety of attached algae was found in lower Red Fish Bay and along the eastern portion of Corpus Christi Bay extending from lower Shamrock Cove northward to the shipping channel. Flowering plans grow on the eastern salt flats and along the shorelines of spoil banks. Observed algae {{was found to be}} both epiphytic or epizooic, i. e. attached to other plans or animals. Most of the benthic forms were, however, lithophytic i. e. attached to sand, mud or shell. Only general observations were made as to density of growth and distribution, Bottom vegetation in the southern, western, northern and central areas o...|$|E
40|$|Being primary producers, diatoms are {{consumed}} by lots of organisms. In order {{to ward off}} the diversity of feeding strategies and to fight for their existence, diatoms have developed extreme stable exoskeletons strengthened by silicate in a multitude of different forms. Diatoms live in different habitats. Some are planktonic, living in the upper water layers, some live attached to stone or seaweeds and others live in the sediments of the <b>benthic</b> <b>division</b> and are able to move actively through it. Because they occupy different habitats, there is a variety of predators. Planktonic diatoms are mainly ingested by planktonic copepods, while diatoms which live in sediments are ingested by nematodes and some gastropods rasp on epiphytic or epilithic diatoms. Hence it can be supposed that diatom-species living in different ecological niches have developed different kinds of stability. In this study, feeding strategies and tools of different predators were examined. The aim has been to test whether diatom-armour is more stable against the feeding tools of predators living in the same habitat, and whether diatom-armour is less stable, if the predator does not live the same water-layer. Feeding-strategies and feeding-tools of different copepods, gastropods and nematodes have been examined by means of scientific literature and additionally by dissecting a radula of Littorina littorea and analyzing its structure and organization by confocal microscopy. N. Niebuhr has performed virtual crashtests between models of feeding-tools of the predators and diatom-models, based on the collected information about feeding-strategies and properties of the feeding-tools. The crashtests showed that the planktonic diatom-species Asterolampra spec. owns best resistance against feeding-tools and -manners of copepods, while it resists poorly against feeding-manners of nematodes and gastropods. Actinoptychus spec., living in sediments, was very instable against the feeding-manners of copepods and more stable against nematodes and gastropods. The last thing to point out is that Arachnoidiscus spec., an epiphytic diatom, showed almost the biggest strength against all kinds of feeding-manners...|$|E
40|$|The {{work of the}} Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) {{concerns}} the ocean-ice-atmosphere system and the communities and geological history of the Polar Regions. The main page has links to AWI research, general information, Click and Learn educational pages for children (with notable sections on sea-ice and animal migrations), and information on the Institutes Ships and Stations. The majority of the site explores the four main research branches - Pelagic Ecosystems, Climate Systems, Benthic Ecosystems, and Geosystems - through project descriptions, progress reports, and an abundance of scientific visualizations. The Pelagic Ecosystems division studies such topics as global carbon cycles, sea ice dynamics, vertical particle fluxes in the Polar Regions, plankton phylogeny, genetics of toxic algae, marine bacteria, anthropogenic chemical tracers, biogeochemical cycles, biooptics, and diatom ecology. Researchers in the Climate Systems division conduct surveys and derive models relating to oceanic and polar circulation patterns and their influence on global climate. Of particular interest to them are stratospheric ozone, tropospheric aerosols, and natural climate variability. The <b>Benthic</b> Ecosystems <b>division</b> concerns itself with ecological, physiological and ecotoxicological topics in coastal and shelf waters. Central themes are coastal ecosystem dynamics, biodiversity, population dynamics, macroalgae, biological indicator systems, ion regulation and metabolism, and toxic damage and carcinogenesis. Researchers in the Geosystems division study processes of deposition and geological transformation in the oceans, periglacial and permafrost dynamics, paleolimnology, bathymetry, marine bio-geochemical cycles, and polar paleoclimatology. Lastly are three additional multidisciplinary workgroups: the Deep Sea Research Group; the Solar Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation Group; and the Carbon Group.
