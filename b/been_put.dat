5|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} have also <b>been</b> <b>put</b> forward {{to explain the}} derivation of Bunbury, and Bunburying, which {{are used in the}} play to imply a secretive double life.

5|$|A similar {{theory to}} Syme's has <b>been</b> <b>put</b> forward by François Paschoud, {{who claimed that}} Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, {{in the same vein}} as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E

5|$|Although many {{hypotheses}} have <b>been</b> <b>put</b> {{forward to}} explain how the ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery.

The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E
