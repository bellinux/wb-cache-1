5|$|Unlike most breeds, {{there is}} a set naming system {{that is used to}} {{identify}} individuals based on the registration format employed by the Canadian Livestock Records Corporation. First comes the prefix, the farm or <b>breeding</b> <b>establishment</b> of which the foal was born into, followed by the sire's name, and lastly the given name for the foal. Each year a different letter is assigned to begin the given name for the foal, and it is by the year's letter that the foal is named. Some older horses do not fall under this naming strategy, but it is now mandatory in naming registered offspring coming from purebred Canadian lines. Originally, horses were tattooed with identification numbers, but now microchipping is the identification technology chosen by the breed registry.|$|E

500|$|Selective {{breeding}} {{for speed}} and racing ability led to {{improvements in the}} size of horses and winning times {{by the middle of the}} 19thcentury. Bay Middleton, a winner of the Epsom Derby, stood over 16hands high, a full hand higher than the Darley Arabian. Winning times had improved to such a degree that many felt further improvement by adding additional Arabian bloodlines was impossible. This was borne out in 1885, when a race was held between a Thoroughbred, Iambic, considered a mid-grade runner, and the best Arabian of the time, Asil. The race was over , and although Iambic was handicapped by carrying [...] more than Asil, he still managed to beat Asil by 20lengths. [...] An aspect of the modern British <b>breeding</b> <b>establishment</b> is that they breed not only for flat racing, but also for steeplechasing. [...] Up until the end of the 19th century, Thoroughbreds were bred not only for racing but also as saddle horses.|$|E

50|$|Other {{countries}} {{into which}} the bullfrog has been introduced include Mexico, the western half of Canada, Cuba, Jamaica, Italy, the Netherlands, and France.

The reasons for introducing the bullfrog to these countries have included their intentional release, either to provide a source of food or as biological control agents, the escape of frogs from <b>breeding</b> <b>establishments,</b> and the escape or release of frogs kept as pets. Conservationists are concerned the bullfrog is relatively immune to the fungal infection chytridiomycosis and as it invades new territories, it may assist the spread of this lethal disease to more susceptible native species of frog.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} {{dogs and cats}} in the Perth {{metropolitan}} area revealed a high prevalence of Giardia. Overall, 21 % of 333 dogs and 14 % of 226 cats were infected.

Giardia did not show any breed or sex predisposition but prevalence was higher in young animals. The species of Giardia present in dogs and cats was identified as G. duodenalis, which is the same as that affecting man. The potential significance of this animal reservoir of infection to man is discussed in the light of increasing evidence that Giardia is a zoonosis...|$|R

40|$|A full {{history of}} the {{management}} practices and the prevalence of upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) at 218 rescue shelters, <b>breeding</b> <b>establishments</b> and private households with five or more cats was recorded.
