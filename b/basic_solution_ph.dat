The removal kinetics of Cu 2 + and Cd 2 + ions by reducing species under different conditions could be described by the first order kinetic equation. The removal efficiency was dependent on the absorbed dose, pH and presence of MeOH and TiO 2 NPs. Removal of Cu 2 + and Cd 2 + ions was facilitated in low pH conditions and combined using of MeOH and TiO 2 NPs.

The fundamental studies of PANI/metal composites were conducted {{to determine if the}} applications for the polymer could be extended to basic solutions that are traditionally precluded. PANI/metal composites are produced electrochemically through the controlled uptake and reduction of metal anions including PtCl 42 -, PdCl 42 -, and AuCl 4 - using cyclic voltammetry. The deposition of metals into PANI was confirmed using the acid doping of the polymer, FTIR spectroscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The acid doping study suggests that the metal species physically block proton-doping sites in the polymer. FT-IR data indicates that a higher oxidation state is obtained for the polymer after the metal reduction. The TGA data also provides the measure of the approximate amount of metal in the polymer. The characterization data suggests that the conductivity should be diminished relative to the pristine polymer. However, all of the PANI/metal composites demonstrate catalytic activity for alcohols oxidation in basic solutions. The data indicate that the electrochemical responses and the conductivity of the composites are maintained at pH values that have typically produced insulating PANI.

40|$|Department of Urban and Environmental Engineering(Environmental Science and Engineering) Membrane {{separation}} process {{is an important}} process that it can convert seawater into potable water. These days, polyamide membranes are replacing cellulose membranes because of their high thermal, chemical, and hydrolytic stabilities. Seawater mostly contains organics and microorganisms that make membrane desalination systems weak due to bio-fouling. Therefore, pretreatment processes designed to eliminate organics and inactivate microorganisms are essential in desalination systems. Chlorine is widely used as a microorganism disinfectant in the industry. However, residual chlorine in the water causes PA membrane performance to degrade easily. It has been known that cross-linked aromatic PA membranes are very delicate to chlorine attack. Therefore, its incompatibility with free chlorine necessitates the search for alternate disinfectants. Halogens such as iodine (I 2) and bromine (Br 2), ozone (O 3), monochloramine (MCA) and chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) {{have been reported to}} be less aggressive as disinfectants. ClO 2, One of them, is a potent and useful oxidizing agent used in water treatment. Especially, it has attracted attention as a replacement for chlorine disinfectant. However, previous researches cannot suggest accurate mechanism about effect of ClO 2 on membranes, especially polyamide membrane. So, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the performance changes of cross-linked polyamide membranes caused by chlorine dioxide solutions at various pH values. The study has performed on three commercially available membranes (NF 270, NF 90 and BW 30 from Dow-FilmTec©. The NF 90 and BW 30 membranes used as representative the aromatic polyamide membranes, whereas, the NF 270 membrane has the semi-aromatic piperazine based membrane. Chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) stock solution was prepared by the reaction of sodium chlorite (NaClO 2) solution with sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4). The concentration of the chlorine dioxide stock solution was measured using an Iodometric Method with a 0. 1 N sodium thiosulfate standard solution. The membrane degradation experiments were conducted by soaking tests under 3 different conditions: (i) constant chlorine dioxide concentration at various pH values, (ii) diverse chlorine dioxide concentrations at fixed pH, (iii) constant chlorine dioxide concentration at fixed pH values which we selected for a long time. After finished, the surface chemical structures of the virgin and modified membranes were identified by using ATR-FTIR, SEM, XPS, Contact angle and TOF-SIMS. Also, the performances of the virgin and modified membranes were identified by using the filtration systems. In the first part of this investigation, the Dead-end system was used to measure the water flux as performance of the membrane. NF 90 and BW 30 membranes treated 100 ppm ClO 2 solutions at various pH values are similar tendency in term of the flux increase upon the pH value. However, water flux of NF 270 membranes treated ClO 2 slightly changed regardless of pH values. FE-SEM and ATR-FTIR data indicate that oxidizing ability of chlorine dioxide increases according to increasing pH values. The prominent chemical structures of the NF 90 and BW 30 polyamide membrane was easily attacked and broken by ClO 2 upon increasing pH values. However, water flux of NF 270 membranes treated chlorine dioxide slightly changed regardless of pH values. This indicates that the NF 270 membrane has strong resistance to ClO 2. In the second and third part of this investigation, changes of polyamide NF 90 chemical structure were focused in detail. At pH 4, the flux decline and salt rejection rise are likely due to polymer rearrangement in the membrane after exposure. In this study, the molecules of chlorine dioxide in aqueous acidic solution (pH 4) were supposed to react with each other and change to chlorine. As a result, the chlorine dioxide made the membrane more hydrophilic as the chlorine did. At pH 12, the flux rise and salt rejection decline are why the polyamide structure was attacked and deteriorated by chlorine dioxide. So, the polysulfone layer under polyamide revealed. Consequently, Water flux awfully increased due to large pores that polysulfone layers have. Through these results, it guesses that collapse of polymer chains occurred in the membrane structure due to chlorine dioxide at pH 12. In the final part of this investigation, mechanism of polyamide degradation due to chlorine dioxide at specific pH values was proposed. ClO 2 molecules at acidic condition are changed into chlorine molecules. As a result, new generated chlorine can attack and degraded the NF 90 polyamide structure. The molecules of ClO 2 in aqueous <b>basic</b> <b>solution</b> (<b>pH</b> 12) reacts rapidly each other and occurs the disproportionation. Also, chlorine dioxide at pH 12 has a highly strong oxidizing power, which can attack easily and deteriorate the polyamide structure. Second, in accordance with the pH values of ClO 2 solution, the polymer structure of polyamide membrane such as NF 90 changes and is attacked differently. The amide polymers of the polyamide membrane are deprotonated in chlorine dioxide solution at pH 12 and might be attacked easily the chlorine dioxide radical due to accepting one electron. However, it seems to need further experiments to prove this hypothesis. Ultimately, this study can propose an optimum pH condition of chlorine dioxide as disinfectant instead of chlorine: Neutral pH (pH 7) is the optimal pH for ClO 2 disinfectant due to little change of flux and surface. Also, this study can propose that NF 270 can be used when ClO 2 is used as disinfectant in desalination process from seawater to portable water. clos...|$|E

The mobile phase was a NaH 2 PO 4 -solution with acetonitrile as an organic modifier and octanesulphonic acid and tetraethylammonium hydrogen sulphate as ion-pair reagents. The recovery of the extraction method was 48 % for naltrexone and 75 % for 6 -β-naltrexol. The limit of quantification was 5. 0 [*]ng/ml for naltrexone and 1. 0 [*]ng/ml for 6 -β-naltrexol.

In acetonitrile, 2 -HEAQ underwent efficient intersystem crossing to the triplet excited state ((2 -HEAQ) (3)).

Observation of the protonated species in neutral and acidic aqueous solutions by fs-TA spectra indicated the carbonyl oxygen of (2 -HEAQ) (3) was protonated initially and acted as a precursor of the photoredox reaction. The preference of the photoredox reaction to occur under moderate acidic conditions compared to neutral condition observed using ns-TR(3) spectroscopy was consistent with results from DFT calculations, which suggested protonation of the carbonyl group was the rate-determining step.

As a result, a web-based acid/base titration calculator (dubbed e-Titrator) with a user-friendly interface is created to help students learn these pH calculations. Students may also use the e-Titrator to double check the results of their own work. In the e-Titrator interface, users first enter the concentrations and other relevant information of the titrant and analyte. Then a virtual titration is easily done at the clicks of a “Titrate” button. The e-Titrator not only calculates the pH value of the mixed solutions but also provides a complete titration graph of pH vs. the volume of the titrant. In addition, details of the calculation can be displayed serving as a step-by-step tutorial. A mobile application will be developed in the future for the rapidly increasing number of users with smart phones...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the performance of}} Sodium Mercaptobenzothiazole (NMBT) as a collector in the flotation of Black Mountain ore. The ore contains metals such as lead, copper and zinc and the associated minerals of economic importance are chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite respectively, with traces of silver. The study evaluated {{the effectiveness of the}} collector and how pH affects the recovery of minerals in particular copper. The performance of the collector was influenced by mineral surface chemistry. The experimental test work was conducted at varying pH levels using Denver flotation cell in order to investigate the collector performance in a basic medium. The experiments were conducted at two different test runs of slightly <b>basic</b> <b>solutions</b> of <b>pH</b> 8. 5 and 9. 0. The results of both fresh ore and floated ore samples were analysed using XRF. Although Black mountain ore contains small quantities of copper as compared to other ores, a significant amount w recovered (± 78 % of the available copper in the ore), as an indication of the performance of NMBT...|$|R
40|$|A {{new family}} of {{luminescent}} and stable silicon-based nanoparticles (NPs), silica cross-linked pluronic F 127 (PF 127) micelles loaded with decyl capped silicon nanoparticles (decyl-SiNPs), were synthesized in aqueous media. The decyl-SiNPs were prepared by first liberating hydride terminated SiNPs (H-SiNPs) from a porous silicon matrix followed by their functionalization via hydrosilylation with 1 -decene under photochemical activation. The silicon-based NPs exhibit bright photoluminescence (PL) with a quantum yield of 3. 8 % and peaking at 2. 0 eV, which lies within the transmission window that {{is useful for}} biological imaging. They display a hydrodynamic size of 25 nm with exterior polyethylene oxide (PEO) blocks stretching out in aqueous media. Chloroform was found to quench the excitation at energy above 4. 9 eV by shielding the incident light or relaxing the charge carriers, which highlights that caution against solvent interference should be taken when performing the studies on PL origin and luminescence efficiency of SiNPs. For PF 127, the blocks of hydrophilic PEO participate in the PL quenching, while poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) does not. The colloidal solution displays excellent PL stability against salt (NaCl) and temperature but is susceptible to <b>basic</b> <b>solution</b> at <b>pH</b> above 9...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} novel, high {{performance}} actuators felt in several fields of robotics, such as assistive or rehabilitative robotics, {{is not fully}} satisfied by current actuation means. This fosters an intense research on novel energy transduction methods. In particular, propellant-based chemical actuators, able to directly convert chemical energy into mechanical energy, appear very promising, although their potential in robotics {{has not yet been}} deeply investigated. This work focuses on H 2 O 2, used as propellant for actuators. This chemical was first used in robotics, with excellent results, by Goldfarb and collaborators, in 2003. H 2 O 2 dissociation is strongly exothermic, which generates important design issues when the actuated machine operates in close proximity to the human body. In this paper it is shown that: 1) is possible to operate the decomposition process at acceptable temperature, by means of <b>basic</b> <b>solutions</b> of hydrogen peroxide; 2) for <b>basic</b> <b>pH</b> <b>solutions,</b> tin becomes an effective catalyst for H 2 O 2 dissociation. A kinetic model of H 2 O 2 dissociation in <b>basic</b> <b>solutions</b> is provided, that is in good agreement with experimental data. We show how the model can be used to gather the necessary information for the dimensioning of H 2 O 2 -based actuators. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

In this work, {{a study of the}} chemical resistance 14 of Fe 2 O 3 silica-coated nanoclusters at different pH is presented. The use of Horizontal Low 15 Gradient Magnetic Field (HLGMF) for the control and separation of the magnetic nanoclusters at 16 diferent magnetic field gradients is also investigated. For these purposes Fe 2 O 3 silica-coated 17 nanoclusters are synthesised and characreized by SQUID, TEM, Zeta potential techniques.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of bio-based {{molecules in}} general, and of carbohydrates and furanics in particular, {{is a highly}} attractive process. The catalytic conversion of renewable compounds is of high importance. Acids and other chemical intermediates issued from oxidation processes have many applications related, especially, to food and detergents, {{as well as to}} pharmaceutics, cosmetics, and the chemical industry. Until now, the oxidation of sugars, furfural, or 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural has been mainly conducted through biochemical processes or with strong inorganic oxidants. The use of these processes very often presents many disadvantages, especially regarding products separation and selectivity control. Generally, the oxidation is performed in batch conditions using an appropriate catalyst and a <b>basic</b> aqueous <b>solution</b> (<b>pH</b> 7 – 9), while bubbling oxygen or air through the slurry. However, there is a renewed interest in working in base-free conditions to avoid the production of salts. Actually, this gives direct access to different acids or diacids without laborious product purification steps. This review focuses on processes applying gold-based catalysts, and on the catalytic properties of these systems in the base-free oxidation of important compounds: C 5 –C 6 sugars, furfural, and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural. A better understanding of the chemical and physical properties of the catalysts and of the operating conditions applied in the oxidation reactions is essential. For this reason, in this review we put emphasis on these most impacting factors...|$|R
40|$|Monodisperse CdS {{spheres of}} size of 40 to 140 [*]nm were {{obtained}} by microwave heating from <b>basic</b> <b>solutions.</b> It is observed that larger CdS spheres were formed at lower <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> (8. 4 – 8. 8) and smaller ones at higher <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> (10. 8 – 11. 3). The color of CdS products changed with <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> and reaction temperature; those synthesized at lower pH and temperature were of green-yellow color, whereas those formed at higher pH and temperature were of orange-yellow color. A good photovoltage was observed in CdS:poly(3 -hexylthiophene) solar cells with spherical CdS particles. This {{is due to the}} good dispersion of CdS nanoparticles in P 3 HT solution that led to a large interface area between the organic and inorganic semiconductors. Higher photocurrent density was obtained in green-yellow CdS particles of lower defect density. The efficient microwave chemistry accelerated the hydrolysis of thiourea in pH lower than 9 and produced monodisperse spherical CdS nanoparticles suitable for solar cell applications...|$|R

40|$|Biocomposites {{formed by}} a pentapeptide (CREKA), which recognizes clotted plasma proteins, {{entrapped}} into the poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) matrix {{have been prepared}} using three very different procedures. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses indicate that PEDOT-CREKA films, prepared by chronoamperometry in <b>basic</b> aqueous <b>solution</b> (<b>pH</b> = 10. 3) and deposited onto a PEDOT internal layer, present the higher concentration of peptide: one CREKA molecule per six polymer repeat units. The surface of this bilayered system shows numerous folds homogeneously distributed, which have been exhaustively characterized by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Indeed, the morphology and topography of such bilayered films is completely {{different from those of}} biocomposite-prepared acid aqueous and organic solutions as polymerization media. The impact of the entrapped peptide molecules in the electrochemical properties of the conducting polymer {{has been found to be}} practically negligible. In contrast, biocompatibility assays with two different cellular lines indicate that PEDOT-CREKA favors cellular proliferation, which has been attributed to the binding of the peptide to the fibrin molecules from the serum used as a supplement in the culture medium. The latter assumption has been corroborated examining the ability of PEDOT-CREKA to bind fibrin. The latter ability has been also used to explore an alternative strategy based on the treatment of PEDOT-CREKA with fibrin to promote cell attachment and growth. Overall, the results suggest that PEDOT-CREKA is appropriated for multiple biomedical applications combining the electrochemical properties of conducting polymer and the ability of the peptide to recognize and bind proteins.

40|$|A {{large body}} of data has been {{collected}} over {{the last fifty years}} on the chemical behavior of f-element ions. The ions undergo rapid hydrolysis reactions in neutral or <b>basic</b> aqueous <b>solutions</b> that produce poorly understood oxide-hydroxide species; therefore, most of the fundamental f-element solution chemistry has allowed synthetic and separations chemists to rationally design advanced organic chelating ligands useful for highly selective partitioning and separation of f-element ions from complex acidic solution matrices. These ligands and new examples under development allow for the safe use and treatment of solutions containing highly radioactive species. This DOE/EMSP project was undertaken to address the following fundamental objectives: (1) study the chemical speciation of Sr and lanthanide (Ln) ions in basic aqueous media containing classical counter anions found in waste matrices; (2) prepare pyridine N-oxide phosphonates and phosphonic acids that might act as selective chelator s for Ln ions in model basic pH waste streams; (3) study the binding of the new chelators toward Ln ions and (4) examine the utility of the chelators as decontamination and dissolution agents under <b>basic</b> <b>solution</b> conditions. The project has been successful in attacking selected aspects of the very difficult problems associated with <b>basic</b> <b>pH</b> <b>solution</b> f-element waste chemistry. In particular, the project has (1) shed additional light on the initial stages of Ln ion sol-gel-precipitate formulation under <b>basic</b> <b>solution</b> conditions; (2) generated new families of pyridine phosphonic acid chelators; (3) characterized the function of the chelators and (4) examined their utility as oxide-hydroxide dissolution agents. These findings have contributed significantly to an improved understanding of the behavior of Ln ions in basic media containing anions found in typical waste sludges {{as well as to the}} development of sludge dissolution agents. The new chelating reagents are easily made and could be prepared in quantities suitable for large scale decontamination and dissolution processes involving sludges.
