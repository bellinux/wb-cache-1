The main aim of this particular experiment is to investigate the effect of the fin shape of the rocket on the drag force encountered by the rocket as it moves through the air. To define the shape of the fins, an angle q on the fins will be varied. (See Fig 1. below.) Figure 1 : Part of the cross-sectional view of the rocket <b>body</b> <b>shaft</b> These fin shapes with angle q varying from 45 to 90 (in increasing steps of 5) will be inserted onto the rocket <b>body</b> <b>shaft</b> during the experiment. A wind tunnel will be used to channel moving air currents upward towards the rocket body. An empirical relation between the resulting drag force and the angle q would be obtained from the experimental results. The interdependence between the wind speed with these two variables would be investigated also. It is hoped that this particular investigation can show whether there is any optimum fin shape (as defined by a corresponding optimum q) that experiences the least drag force when the rocket body is subjected to a flow of air currents within the limits that were set for the variables under investigation. qq ROCKET BODY Section 2 : Theoretical Background 2 (a) Introduction Two types of drag, form (or pressure) drag and skin friction, are encountered in the flow of a viscous incompressible fluid past a body. Form drag results mainly from the separation of the flow from the body, for example, as occurs with a stalled airfoil. As a result of flow separation, the configuration of the streamlines and hence the pressure distribution over the body are altered considerably from what they are for perfect fluid flow. The integration over the surface of the downstream component of the pressure forces on the elem [...] ...|$|E

OBJECTIVES: Research investigating the longitudinal effects {{of the most popular}} sports on bone development in adolescent males is scarce. The aim is to investigate the effect of 12 -month participation in osteogenic and non-osteogenic sports on bone development. DESIGN: A 12 -month study was conducted in adolescent males involved in football, swimming and cycling and compared with an active control group. METHODS: 116 adolescent males (13. 1 ± 0. 1 years at baseline) : 37 footballers, 37 swimmers, 28 cyclists and 14 active controls were followed for 12 months. Bone mineral content (BMC) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and bone stiffness was measured by quantitative ultrasound. Bone outcomes at 12 months were adjusted for baseline bone status, age, height, lean mass and moderate to vigorous physical activity. RESULTS: Footballers had higher improvement in adjusted BMC at the total body, total hip, shaft, Ward's triangle, legs and bone stiffness compared to cyclists (6. 3 - 8. 0 %). Footballers had significantly higher adjusted BMC at total <b>body,</b> <b>shaft</b> and legs compared to swimmers (5. 4 - 5. 6 %). There {{was no significant difference between}} swimmers and cyclists for any bone outcomes. Swimming and cycling participation resulted in non-significant lower bone development at most sites of the skeleton compared to controls (- 4. 3 to - 0. 6 %). CONCLUSIONS: Football participation induces significantly greater improvements in BMC and bone stiffness over 12 months compared to cycling and swimming. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN 17982776.
