25|$|Similarly, {{cutaneous}} (skin) {{conditions can}} also involve {{the mouth and}} sometimes only the mouth, sparing the skin. The different environmental conditions (saliva, thinner mucosa, trauma from teeth and food), mean that some cutaneous disorders which produce characteristic lesions on the skin produce only non specific lesions in the mouth. The vesicles and bullae of blistering mucocutaneous disorders progress quickly to ulceration in the mouth, because of moisture and trauma from food and teeth. The high <b>bacterial</b> <b>load</b> in the mouth means that ulcers may become secondarily infected. Cytotoxic drugs administered during chemotherapy target cells with fast turnovers such as malignant cells. However, the epithelia of the mouth also has a high turnover rate and makes oral ulceration (mucositis) a common side effect of chemotherapy.|$|E

40|$|Background Polyhexamethylene {{biguanide}} (PHMB) -based antiseptic solutions {{can reduce}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> in different clinical settings and {{are believed to}} lower risk of infections. Objective We sought to assess the efficacy of a PHMB-based solution in lowering <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> of full-thickness skin grafting wounds {{and the risk of}} surgical site infections (SSIs). Methods In this double-blinded clinical trial, 40 patients planned for facial full-thickness skin grafting were randomized 1 : 1 to receive tie-over dressings soaked with either PHMB-based solution or sterile water. Quantitative and qualitative bacterial analysis was performed on all wounds before surgery, at the end of surgery, and 7 days postoperatively. In addition, all patients were screened for nasal colonization of Staphylococcus aureus. Results Analysis of wounds showed no statistically significant difference in bacterial reductions between the groups. The SSI rates were significantly higher in the intervention group (8 / 20) than in the control group (2 / 20) (P =. 028). Higher postoperative <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> were a common finding in SSIs (P =. 011). This was more frequent when S aureus was present postoperatively (P =. 034), intraoperatively (P =. 03), and in patients with intranasal S aureus colonization (P =. 007). Limitations Assessment of SSIs is largely subjective. In addition, this was a single-center study and the total number of participants was 40. Conclusion Soaking tie-over dressings with PHMB solution in full-thickness skin grafting had no effect on postoperative <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> and increased the risk of SSI development. The presence of S aureus intranasally and in wounds preoperatively and postoperatively increased postoperative <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads,</b> which in turn resulted in significantly more SSIs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFeathers play an {{important}} role in many aspects of avian life histories, for exampling acting in thermoregulation, communication and flight. Damaged feathers may reduce the ability to perform these functions, so there are likely fitness costs for individuals possessing damaged plumage. Recently, descriptive studies provided evidence that birds carry featherdegrading bacteria on their plumage. These bacteria have the ability to degrade feathers, rapidly under laboratory conditions, more slowly under field conditions. If such feather-degrading bacteria reduce avian fitness, natural selection should favour the evolution of anti-bacterial defences. Moult has been suggested as one such defence. Here we test this prediction with mallards, Anas platyrhynchos, and the use of repeated measures of total cultivable and feather-degrading <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> on the same birds before, during and after moult. We found that moult had no significant effect on total cultivable and feather-degrading <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> on feathers. Our results show that the bacterial contamination that takes place after moult overrides the potential role of moult as a mechanism to reduce feather <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Recent {{technological}} advancements produced novel approaches such as self-adaptive wound dressings {{that rely on}} properties of smart polymers sensitive to changes in humidity levels. The dressing delivers absorption or hydration as needed over each independent wound area and aids in the natural process of autolytic debridement. It effectively removes liquefied slough and necrotic tissue, disintegrated bacterial biofilm as well as harmful exudate components, known to slow the healing process. The treatment also reduces <b>bacterial</b> <b>load</b> [...] by effective evacuation and immobilization of microorganisms from the wound bed, and subsequent chemical binding of available water that is necessary for their replication. [...] Self-adaptive dressings protect periwound skin from extrinsic factors and infection while regulating moisture balance over vulnerable skin around the wound.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effects of a widely used antibiotic, {{oxytetracycline}} (OTC) on the bacterial microflora in two catfish species under artificial culture conditions in the laboratory. Methods: The experiment was conducted in the Faculty of Fisheries, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh- 2202. The fish were reared in six aquaria (size 37 cm× 30 cm× 60 cm) where three aquaria served as replicates of the antibiotic treatment groups and the remaining three aquaria served as an untreated control group. Each aquarium was stocked with 25 fish on an average body weight 15 g. OTC was administered to the fish in the treatment groups at the rate of 2 g/kg in-feed twice daily upto ad libitum, whereas fish in the untreated control groups were given the same feed without antibiotics for 20 d. During the experiment, <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> were estimated as colony forming unit (CFU/g) by every alternate day in the aquarium water, gills, skin and intestine of fish. Results: The administration of OTC in feed resulted in gradual decrease of <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> in the gills, intestine and skin of the two catfish species tested. In contrast, the <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> remain unchanged or slightly increased in the control groups not fed with OTC. Water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, pH and total hardness were found to be within suitable range in the test aquaria but not in control aquarium throughout the experimental period. Conclusions: The results of this experiment showed that in-feed antibiotic OTC for a period of 20 d reduced the <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> in the gills, intestines and skin of treated fish...|$|R
40|$|Leptospirosis causes {{significant}} {{morbidity and}} mortality worldwide; however, {{the role of the}} host immune response in disease progression and high case fatality (> 10 - 50 %) is poorly understood. We conducted a multi-parameter investigation of patients with acute leptospirosis to identify mechanisms associated with case fatality. Whole blood transcriptional profiling of 16 hospitalized Brazilian patients with acute leptospirosis (13 survivors, 3 deceased) revealed fatal cases had lower expression of the antimicrobial peptide, cathelicidin, and chemokines, but more abundant pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors. In contrast, survivors generated strong adaptive immune signatures, including transcripts relevant to antigen presentation and immunoglobulin production. In an independent cohort (23 survivors, 22 deceased), fatal cases had higher <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> (P = 0. 0004) and lower anti-Leptospira antibody titers (P = 0. 02) at the time of hospitalization, independent of the duration of illness. Low serum cathelicidin and RANTES levels during acute illness were independent risk factors for higher <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> (P = 0. 005) and death (P = 0. 04), respectively. To investigate the mechanism of cathelicidin in patients surviving acute disease, we administered LL- 37, the active peptide of cathelicidin, in a hamster model of lethal leptospirosis and found it significantly decreased <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> and increased survival. Our findings indicate that the host immune response plays a central role in severe leptospirosis disease progression. While drawn from a limited study size, significant conclusions include that poor clinical outcomes are associated with high systemic <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads,</b> and a decreased antibody response. Furthermore, our data identified a key role for the antimicrobial peptide, cathelicidin, in mounting an effective bactericidal response against the pathogen, which represents a valuable new therapeutic approach for leptospirosis...|$|R

40|$|Water quality {{within the}} Thomas Brook watershed, {{which is a}} small {{catchment}} located in {{the headwaters of the}} Cornwallis River drainage basin, was assessed through an integrated monitoring program. The Thomas Brook watershed is approximately 1000 ha and is characterized by both agricultural and residential land uses. Fecal coliform concentrations and stream flow were monitored at several points throughout the watershed during an eight-month period (May to December, 2001). Thomas Brook was seriously degraded with respect to micro-bial water quality. Fecal coliform levels frequently exceeded recreational water quality guidelines. At the watershed outlet, 94 % of the collected samples exceeded the recreational water quality guideline during low flow conditions. Substantial <b>bacterial</b> <b>loading</b> was observed along stream reaches impacted by livestock operations. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>loading</b> was also observed along a stream reach that was not impacted by agricultural activities.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundLoss of {{intestinal}} {{integrity is}} a critical contributor to excessive inflammation following severe trauma or major surgery. In the case of enterocyte damage, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (IFABP) is released into the extracellular space. Excessive production of interleukin (IL) - 6 can induce systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). However, the correlation of IL- 6 with gut barrier failure and bacterial translocation in critically ill patients has not been well characterized. PurposesTo define the relationship between enteric <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> and IL- 6 levels in patients with SIRS. MethodsVariables related to prognosis and treatment were measured in 85 patients with SIRS upon admission to the emergency room. IL- 6 and IFABP were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Enteric <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> in blood were measured through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for enteric bacteria. ResultsMultivariate analysis revealed {{a positive correlation between}} enteric <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> and IL- 6 levels in blood. Elevated IFABP concentration was associated with low blood pressure, high respiration rate, hyperglycemia, and high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Elevated C-reactive protein concentrations were associated with higher soluble CD 14 levels in blood. ConclusionEnterocyte damage is associated with hypotension and tachypnia in patients with SIRS. Gut function failure may permit enteric bacteria to enter the blood, thereby elevating IL- 6 levels and inducing a systemic inflammatory response, resulting in multiple organ failure...|$|R

The current pilot study aimed at studying the combined effect of AATD and <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> on the efficacy of COPD conventional pharmacotherapy. Fifty-nine subjects (29 controls and 30 COPD patients) were tested for genetic AATD and respiratory function. The <b>bacterial</b> <b>loads</b> were determined to the patients’ group who were then given a long acting beta-agonist and corticosteroid inhaler for 6  months. Nineteen percent of the studied group were Pi∗MZ (heterozygote deficiency variant), Pi∗S (5 %) (milder deficiency variant), Pi∗ZZ (10 %) (the most common deficiency variant), and Pi∗Mmalton (2 %) (very rare deficiency variant). The patients’ sputum contained from 0 to 8  ×  108  CFU/mL pathogenic bacteria. The forced vital capacity (FVC 6) values of the AAT non-deficient group significantly improved after 3 and 6  months. Patients lacking AATD and pathogenic bacteria showed significant improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV 1), FEV 1 /FVC 6, FVC 6, and 6  min walk distance (6 MWD) after 6  months.
