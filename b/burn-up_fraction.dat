50|$|Daedalus {{would be}} {{propelled}} by a fusion rocket using pellets of a deuterium/helium-3 mix {{that would be}} ignited in the reaction chamber by inertial confinement using electron beams. The electron beam system would be powered {{by a set of}} induction coils trapping energy from the plasma exhaust stream. 250 pellets would be detonated per second, and the resulting plasma would be directed by a magnetic nozzle. The computed <b>burn-up</b> <b>fraction</b> for the fusion fuels was 0.175 and 0.133 producing exhaust velocities of 10,600 km/s and 9,210 km/s respectively. Due to scarcity of helium-3 on Earth, it was to be mined from the atmosphere of Jupiter by large hot-air balloon supported robotic factories over a 20-year period, or from a more abundant source, such as the Moon.|$|E
40|$|In a bounce-free spherical {{hydrodynamic}} implosion, the post-stagnation hot core plasma {{does not}} expand against the imploding flow. Such an implosion scheme {{has the advantage}} of improving the dwell time of the burning fuel, resulting in a higher fusion <b>burn-up</b> <b>fraction.</b> The existence of bounce-free spherical implosions is demonstrated by explicitly constructing a family of self-similar solutions to the spherically symmetric ideal hydrodynamic equations. When applied to a specific example of plasma liner driven magneto-inertial fusion, the bounce-free solution is found to produce at least a factor of four improvement in dwell time and fusion energy gain.

40|$|The Laser Inertial Fusion Energy (LIFE) {{engine is}} a laser-driven {{inertial}} fusion energy system being developed {{with the goal}} to deliver fusion power in the next decade. A pre-conceptual design is being developed for the LIFE fuel cycle, {{with the purpose of}} maximizing the potential safety advantages of fusion energy. Some key features of the LIFE fuel cycle include a high tritium fuel <b>burn-up</b> <b>fraction,</b> a relatively high tritium breeding ratio, low tritium permeation from the coolant/breeder, and limited tritium inventories throughout the facility. The present paper offers an overview the pre-conceptual design of the LIFE fuel cycle, including a summary of the development plan for the delivery of the related tritium processing equipment...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} studies only circular cross section reactor plasmas were considered. The {{purpose of this}} research is {{to examine the effects of}} elliptical plasma cross sections. Several technological benefits have been determined. Maximum magnetic field strength requirements are 30 to 65 percent less than for 5000 MW (th) reactors and may be as much as 40 percent less than for circular cross section reactors of comparable size. Very large n tau values are found (10 $sup 15 $ to 10 $sup 17 $ sec/cm$sup 3 $), which produce large <b>burn-up</b> <b>fractions</b> (15 to 60 percent). There is relatively little problem with impurity build-up. Long confinement times (60 to 500 seconds) are found. Finally, the elliptical cross section reactors exhibit a major toroidal radius reduction of as large as 30 percent over circular reactors operating at comparable power levels. (auth...|$|R
40|$|The neutronic {{parameters}} are {{required in the}} safety analysis of the RSG-GAS research reactor. The RSG-GAS research reactor, MTR (Material Testing Reactor) type is used for research and also in radioisotope production. RSG-GAS has been operating for 30 years without experiencing significant obstacles. It is managed under strict requirements, especially fuel management and fuel burn-up calculations. The reactor is operated {{under the supervision of}} the Regulatory Body (BAPETEN) and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency). In this paper, the experience of managing RSG-GAS core fuels will be discussed, there are hundred possibilities of fuel placements on the reactor core and the strategy used to operate the reactor will be crucial. However, based on strict calculation and supervision, there is no incorrect placement of the fuels in the core. The calculations were performed on working core by using the WIMSD- 5 B computer code with ENDFVII. 0 data file to generate the macroscopic cross-section of fuel and BATAN-FUEL code were used to obtain the neutronic parameter value such as fuel <b>burn-up</b> <b>fractions.</b> The calculation of the neutronic core parameters of the RSG-GAS research reactor was carried out for U 3 Si 2 -Al fuel, 250 grams of mass, with an equilibrium core strategy. The calculations show that on the last three operating cores (T 90, T 91, T 92), all fuels meet the safety criteria and the fuel burn-up does not exceed the maximum discharge burn-up of 59 %. Maximum fuel burn-up always exists in the fuel which is close to the position of control rod...|$|R
40|$|Magnetized target fusion is an emerging, {{relatively}} unexplored {{approach to}} fusion for electrical power and propulsion application. The physical {{principles of the}} concept are founded upon both inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). It attempts to combine the favorable attributes of both these orthogonal approaches to fusion, {{but at the same}} time, avoiding the extreme technical challenges of both by exploiting a fusion regime intermediate between them. It uses a material liner to compress, heat and contain the fusion reacting plasma (the target plasma) mentally. By doing so, the fusion burn could be made to occur at plasma densities as high as six orders of magnitude higher than conventional MCF such as tokamak, thus leading to an approximately three orders of magnitude reduction in the plasma energy required for ignition. It also uses a transient magnetic field, compressed to extremely high intensity (100 's T to 1000 T) in the target plasma, to slow down the heat transport to the liner and to increase the energy deposition of charged-particle fusion products. This has several compounding beneficial effects. It leads to longer energy confinement time compared with conventional ICF without magnetized target, and thus permits the use of much lower plasma density to produce reasonable <b>burn-up</b> <b>fraction.</b> The compounding effects of lower plasma density and the magneto-insulation of the target lead to greatly reduced compressional heating power on the target. The increased energy deposition rate of charged-particle fusion products also helps to lower the energy threshold required for ignition and increasing the <b>burn-up</b> <b>fraction.</b> The reduction in ignition energy and the compressional power compound to lead to reduced system size, mass and R&D cost. It is a fusion approach that has an affordable R&D pathway, and appears attractive for propulsion application in the nearer term...|$|E
