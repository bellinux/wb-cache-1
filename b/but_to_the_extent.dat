50|$|In general, in Marxist terms, wage {{laborers and}} those {{dependent}} on the welfare state are working class, and those who live on accumulated capital are not. This broad dichotomy defines the class struggle. Different groups and individuals may {{at any given time}} be on one side or the other. For example, retired factory workers are working-class in the popular sense; <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> that they live off fixed incomes, financed by stock in corporations whose earnings are profit, retired factory workers' interests, and possibly their identities and politics, are not working class. Such contradictions of interests and identity within individuals' lives and within communities can effectively undermine the ability of the working class to act in solidarity to reduce exploitation, inequality, and the role of ownership in determining people's life chances, work conditions, and political power.|$|E
