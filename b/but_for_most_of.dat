5|$|After {{working and}} {{training}} in Bolton and Manchester, Holden moved to London. His early buildings were influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his career he championed an unadorned style based on simplified forms and massing that was free of what he considered to be unnecessary decorative detailing. Holden believed strongly that architectural designs should be dictated by buildings' intended functions. After the First World War he increasingly simplified his style and his designs became pared-down and modernist, influenced by European architecture. He {{was a member of}} the Design and Industries Association and the Art Workers' Guild. He produced complete designs for his buildings including the interior design and architectural fittings.|$|E

She was invited {{for an interview with}} Queen Victoria and Florence Nightingale at Windsor Castle in 1868.|$|E

25|$|Pelham was at Cambridge University {{for four}} years from the autumn of 1930, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his student time there he was an {{irregular}} cricketer, seldom picked for the university side.

25|$|Hangul is a {{featural}} alphabet {{written in}} morpho-syllabic blocks, and {{was designed for}} both the Korean and Chinese languages, though the letters specific to Chinese are now obsolete. Each block consists {{of at least one}} consonant letter and one vowel letter. When promulgated, the blocks reflected the morphology of Korean, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the fifteenth century they were organized into syllables. In the twentieth century the morpho-syllabic tradition was revived. The blocks were traditionally written in vertical columns from top to bottom, although they are now commonly written in horizontal rows from left to right as well. Spacing has been introduced to separate words in the Western fashion, and punctuation to indicate clauses and sentences, so that Hangul now transcribes Korean at the levels of feature, segment, syllable, morpheme, word, clause, and sentence. However, the suprasegmental features of tone and vowel length, seen as single and double tick marks {{to the left of the}} syllabic blocks in the image in the next section, have been dropped. Six new letters, including two of Sejong's which had become obsolete, were introduced in North Korea in 1948 in order to make Hangul a perfect morphophonological fit to the Korean language, but they were soon discarded.|$|E

500|$|The Lynton & Barnstaple Railway (L&B) opened as an {{independent}} railway in May 1898. It was a single track, [...] narrow gauge railway and was slightly over [...] long running through the rugged and picturesque area bordering Exmoor in North Devon, England. Although opened after the 1896 Light Railways Act came into force, it was authorised and constructed prior to that act. Therefore, as with all other railways, it was authorised under its own Act of Parliament and built to higher (and more costly) standards than similar railways of the time. In the United Kingdom it was notable as being the only narrow gauge line required to use main-line standard signalling. For a short period the line earned a modest return for shareholders, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its life the L made a loss.

500|$|The grain used in Grodziskie is malted wheat. [...] During the malting process, {{the wheat}} is dried in kilns that are heated by oak-burning {{furnaces}}. [...] Instead {{of using the}} furnaces to heat air which is then used to dry the wheat, the hot smoke from the kilns is forced directly through the grain bed. [...] The smoke dries the grain, and imparts a light color and an intense, pleasant, smoky flavor. [...] This [...] process {{would not be possible}} in the type of kilns that were more common in the past, that burned coal or coke as fuel because the soot in the smoke would cause the grain to become discolored and contribute undesirable harsh flavors. [...] The exact degree of smokiness that resulted from the oak kilning in historical times is not known. [...] The smoke from the malting process also adds chemical components to the finished product that help preserve it, giving it a long shelf life despite its low alcohol content. [...] One story is told of a box of Grodziskie being found in the 1950s, buried in the sands of North Africa, that was left behind by German soldiers during World War II. [...] The beer was opened and found to be as fresh as the day it was made. [...] In addition to wheat, there were periods when the beer also included malted barley in various proportions, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its history, it was made entirely from wheat.|$|E
500|$|Butterfly {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Nathan Brackett, {{senior editor of}} Rolling Stone and author of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, praised the album's producers and Carey's [...] "more controlled" [...] vocals. Brackett noticed a connection between much of Carey's lyrics and her separation from Mottola. Jon Pareles, editor of The New York Times called Butterfly [...] "a new turn" [...] in Carey's career. He wrote, [...] "Carey has sold {{tens of millions of}} albums by being the girl next door with the startling vocal range... <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Butterfly" [...] Carey turned her voice into an airy whisper, as if she would rather charm listeners" [...] compared to over-powering them. Aside from commenting on its deviance from Carey's previous work, he noted songs in which Carey alludes to her failed marriage to Mottola, such as [...] "Butterfly" [...] and [...] "Close My Eyes" [...] which were both released on the album following the divorce with lyrics about letting love go and life struggles. Additionally he wrote, [...] "Since Carey writes her own lyrics, fans might expect a glimpse of marital discord or pride in her new-found autonomy." [...] David Browne from Entertainment Weekly gave Butterfly a B- in his review. Browne wrote: [...] "In Breakdown, [...] demonstrates she can match the staccato, lite-reggae phrasing of her guests, two members of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony." [...] He described an increased intimacy in the music but noted the arrangement made it difficult to hear the lyrics Carey was singing. [...] "Butterfly is undeniably pleasant, with little of the all-conquering bombast usually associated with Carey. But it's also the last thing anyone would have expected from her: blandly self-effacing." ...|$|E
