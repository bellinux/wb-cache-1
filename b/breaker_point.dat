5000|$|A {{spark plug}} gap gauge is a disc with a sloping edge, or with round wires of precise diameters, and is {{used to measure the}} gap. Use of a feeler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on {{distributor}} points or valve lash, will give erroneous results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes. The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and <b>breaker</b> <b>point</b> distributors, to the extent that spark plug gauges from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars. [...] Vehicles using compressed natural gas generally require narrower gaps than vehicles using gasoline.|$|E

Usually there is also a capacitor attached to the distributor. The capacitor is connected parallel to the <b>breaker</b> <b>points,</b> to suppress sparking to prevent excessive wear of the points.|$|R
40|$|Wave {{breaking}} is {{the dominant}} process in the dynamics of nearshore water movements resulting in sediment transport. The transformation of the subsequent particle motion from irrotational to rotational motion generates vorticity and turbulence and this affects the sediment transport. An improved understanding of {{the location of the}} <b>breaker</b> <b>point</b> and characteristics of the wave under these changing parameters is essential to our understanding of short and long-term morphological beach development. This paper reports a series of 3 -dimensional physical model tests to measure longshore current data, generated by oblique wave attack, along gravel and mixed beaches with a uniform slope and a trench.

Natural coarse sands are used to represent cliff erosion and bottom morphodynamics with a reasonable time scale. A bottom typology is established {{as a function of}} wave forcing, through the wave energy flux F and the surf similarity parameter ξ. The bottom types strongly depends on the surf similarity parameter at the <b>breaker</b> <b>point</b> ξb. Steep terraces (ξb > 0. 48), one-bar profiles (0. 42 < ξb < 0. 48), gentle terraces (0. 38 < ξb < 0. 43) and double-bars profiles (ξb < 0. 38) were observed. It can be translated into a Dean parameter Ω vs. Shields number Θb space to take into account sediment granulometry. Sediment grain diameter change has no noticeable influence on bottom typology. The bottom types depends more on the Dean parameter Ω than on the Shields number Θb. Finally, we explored cliff height effect: it does not modify the bottom typology established...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. During a full tidal cycle, {{the beach}} profile {{is exposed to}} {{continuously}} changing hydrodynamical conditions. Consequently, the profile evolves constantly to adapt to these changes. The equilibrium condition on tidal beaches is {{defined in terms of}} the relative occurrence of swash, surf zone and shoaling processes. We have assumed that the tidal beach profile is in equilibrium when the net sediment transport along a tidal cycle is zero. In this model the contribution of swash is considered negligible. A simple and easy-to-apply equilibrium profile formulation is proposed. This model {{is based on the assumption}} that surf zone processes dominate the profile morphology wherever wave breaking occurs during the tidal cycle. The obtained equilibrium profile is valid from the high tide level to the <b>breaker</b> <b>point</b> at low tide level. The tidal influence on the profile morphology is the lengthening of the surf profile. The higher the tidal range, the longer the surf profile. The model was tested against field and laboratory data, showing reasonable predictions of measured beach profiles...|$|E

Established in 1998, this museum is located on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln East Campus. It is and appropriately housed within the walls of the historic 1920 Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory, where the first tractor test was started on March 31 st, 1920. Because the pioneer tests became worldwide standards, this location was designated as a Historic Landmark of Agricultural Engineering by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers in 1980, shortly after testing was moved to a new nearby facility on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln East Campus. The Tractor Test Museum and the Tractor Test Laboratory are open to the public. Group tours may be arranged through the museum by calling 402 - 472 - 8389 or visiting [URL] EXPLANATION OF TEST REPORT TEST A: The manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s representative operates the tractor for a minimum of 12 hours using light to heavy drawbar loads in each gear. This serves as a period for limber up, general observation and adjustments. Adjustments that are permissible include valve tappet clearance, <b>breaker,</b> <b>point</b> gap, spark plug gaps, clutch and others of a similar nature. No new parts or accessories can be installed without having mention made of it in the report. No data 2 ̆ 7 are recorded during this preliminary run except the time that the engine is operated. BELT HORSEPOWER TESTS TEST B: The manual throttle control level is set so that the throttle valve is held wide opened and the belt load on the dynamometer is adjusted so that the engine is at the rated speed recommended by the manufacturer. Carburetor, ignition timing and manifold adjustments are all set for maximum engine power. This test is designed to determine maximum belt horsepower of the tractor at rated speed and to measure fuel consumption at the maximum power on the belt. TEST C: For tractors with carburetors the best fuel economy does not always occur when the engine develops maximum power at rated speed. Test C is intended to allow the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s representative to select a more economical fuel setting even though there is a slight loss of power. This more practical carburetor setting is used in all later tests except test F. The throttle valve is held wide open and load adjusted to give rated rpm. Tests B and C are the same for diesel tractors, which have an altogether different fuel system. TEST D: The manual throttle control lever is set the same as for tests B and C allowing the governor to control engine speed at part throttle. Load is applied until 85...|$|E
40|$|The present wave {{transformation}} models for random waves {{make use of}} an explicit formulation of the energy dissipation. A time-averaged model has been studied in which the dissipation rate per breaking wave is estimated from that in a bore of corresponding height. The probability of occurrence of breaking is derived from a wave height distribution in which all breaking waves have been assumed {{to have the same}} height. This probability can be interpreted as the fraction of waves that are breaking at a certain location. Comparisons with measurements show that with the calibrated values for the parameters the wave height decay is predicted well, The fraction of breaking waves however is underpredicted, especially for high steepness waves. A second drawback is an inaccurate prediction of the mean water level. The positive gradient in the mean water level is predicted too early compared to measurements. The prediction of the mean water level has been improved by taking the transition zone into account. In this zone shoreward of the <b>breaker</b> <b>point</b> the just broken wave develops its turbulence. It is characterised by a rapid wave height decay and roughly constant mean water level. The organised wave energy is not dissipated immediately, but transferred into kinetic energy of the so-called roller, a body of water at the front face of the wave. A recently developed model has been used for the contribution of the roller in which the fraction of breaking waves plays an important role. A sensitivity analysis of the model with respect to its parameter values has lead to two improvements in the model. The first improvement consists of a new choice of the two free parameters in the model. With the new parameter setting both wave height decay and fraction of breaking waves can be predicted well. The second improvement consists of a small change in the formulation of the dissipation rate. In this formulation the energy dissipation rate in a breaking wave more closely resembles the dissipation in a bore. The optimal parameter values yield similar predictions of wave height and fraction of breaking waves, but the parameters have a clearer physical meaning. For the parameters qualitative relations have been found with wave and bottom parameters. On non-monotonic profiles the predictions of the fraction of breaking waves are less satisfactory. The maximum fraction of breaking waves is not found at the bar-crest, as predicted, but some di stance beyond it. Also the model is not able to reproduce the breaking persistenee of the waves. In the analysis existing laboratory measurements have been used on both plane slopes and non-monotonic profiles. Video records of large scale experiments have been analysed for the fraction of breaking waves. The study has taken place at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona as part of the ERASMUS exchange program. Ocean wavesHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

50|$|The Triumph worker's {{co-operative}} at the Meriden factory re-introduced the Thunderbird {{model name}} to their range in April 1981. The Triumph TR65 Thunderbird 650 cc parallel-twin was a short-stroke {{version of the}} 750 cc T140 Bonneville engine and was the cheapest model in Triumph's range with budget features such as a drum rather than disc rear brake, {{the absence of a}} tachometer, a siamesed exhaust system, painted rather than polished alloy and economy Dunlop Gold Seal tyres. Moreover, whereas Triumph's 750cc range had electronic ignition, the TR65 was fitted with contact <b>breaker</b> <b>points.</b> Respecting its lineage, the model retained the Turner-designed 'paper dart' logo on its side panels but with a different, updated 'Thunderbird' script.

25|$|The {{ignition}} firing sequence {{begins with}} the <b>points</b> (or contact <b>breaker)</b> closed. A steady current flows from the battery, through the current-limiting resistor, through the primary coil, through the closed <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> and finally back to the battery.

50|$|The term Renix {{also has}} a number of applications.

25|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the mechanical}} system {{is the use of}} <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> to interrupt the low-voltage high-current through the primary winding of the coil; the points are subject to mechanical wear where they ride the cam to open and shut, as well as oxidation and burning at the contact surfaces from the constant sparking. They require regular adjustment to compensate for wear, and the opening of the contact breakers, which is responsible for spark timing, is subject to mechanical variations.|$|R
50|$|Since {{they open}} and close several times with every turn of the engine, contact <b>breaker</b> <b>points</b> and cam {{follower}} suffer from wear—both mechanical and pitting caused by arcing across the contacts. This latter effect is largely prevented by placing a capacitor parallel across the contact breaker—this is usually referred to by the more old fashioned term condenser by mechanics. As well as suppressing arcing, it helps boost the coil output by creating a resonant LC circuit with the coil windings.|$|R
50|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{and computer}} engine management systems are now normal on middle range and larger motorcycles and {{are increasingly being}} incorporated onto the smaller machines, partly driven by better emission control and lower maintenance but mostly by manufacturing cost considerations. Ignition systems moved from magneto in the 1950s to battery-coil-contact <b>breaker</b> (<b>points),</b> and these were increasingly superseded by Capacitor Discharge Ignition (CDI) from the 1980s. Small, single-cylinder motorcycles abandoned the flywheel magneto system with contact breakers to similar flywheel driven solid-state systems {{at about the same}} time.|$|R
