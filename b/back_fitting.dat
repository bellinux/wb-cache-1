5000|$|The village pub is the New Inn. An {{historic}} pub {{interior of}} [...] "national importance" [...] Listed Status: Grade II. This red-brick hotel-cum-pub built in 1885 for the South Down & East Grinstead Brewery retains its plan-form and fittings virtually intact at present. The central entrance has 'Hotel Entrance' etched {{glass in the}} doors {{and to the right}} are a pair of doors leading to the public bar with one remaining 'Public Bar' etched panel. To be noted is the ceramic button with the figure '1' above the inside of the front doors - a requirement of licensing magistrates. The pub part is small with a long public bar fronting the main street (there was probably a screen dividing it originally) and one small room behind. The spartan public bar fittings are much as they were in Victorian times with a wood-block floor, a long Victorian counter with the front painted cream, bar <b>back</b> <b>fitting</b> with three large cash drawers (note two slots for notes) and four ceramic spirit barrels (note ‘I Whisky’ from the days before the fad of inserting an ‘e’ to distinguish the Irish from the Scottish variety). There are two sections of wall bench seating attached to matchboard dado panelling and a small early 20th century tiled fireplace with decoration on the wood surround and with a log fire. To be noted is the hatch on the left of the servery for customers of the hotel and waiters who would have served the former restaurant. At the rear right is the snug, a small room which now has a carpet and is home to a bar billiards table, The matchboard dado panels have been painted white and service is via the original split doors with a hatch/shelf {{to the back of the}} bar. On the front left side of the building are twin currently out of use doors with ‘Hotel Entrance’ etched panels which lead into a corridor and off to the left is the former dining room with further matchboard panelling and an ornate cast-iron fireplace. The pub still retains its outside gents’ and ladies’.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the derivation, and use a Monte Carlo study to examine the finite sample {{performances}} of select estimators put forth in Martins-Filho et al. (2015) for partially linear semiparametric models under nonparametric endogeneity. We find that the selected estimators sufficiently account for the explicit nonparametric endogeneity of the underlying model in finite samples, and conclude that the one step <b>back</b> <b>fitting</b> and unweighted pilot estimators are more efficient {{than their counterparts in}} estimating m(x) and β respectively. Our findings support the assertion that both estimators for m(x) are oracle efficient...|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} factors to {{consider}} when fitting a saddle, and a professional saddle maker may be consulted to fit a saddle properly to a horse's <b>back.</b> Incorrectly <b>fitting</b> saddles cause pressure points, which may result in bruising, soreness, and behavior problems under saddle. The saddle must also fit the rider, as security on the horse can be compromised when a saddle is the wrong size.|$|R

50|$|Styles {{changed in}} the 17th century and men began to wear watches in pockets instead of as {{pendants}} (the woman's watch remained a pendant into the 20th century). This {{is said to have}} occurred in 1675 when Charles II of England introduced waistcoats. To fit in pockets, their shape evolved into the typical pocket watch shape, rounded and flattened with no sharp edges. Glass was used to cover the face beginning around 1610. Watch fobs began to be used, the name originating from the German word fuppe, a small pocket. The watch was wound and also set by opening the <b>back</b> and <b>fitting</b> a key to a square arbor, and turning it.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{explore the}} {{experiences}} of Australian adolescents with severe acquired brain injury (ABI) and their families as the adolescent returned to school. In particular, to understand the influence of services and support on the school return. Method. In-depth interviews conducted {{over a two-year period}} with families who had an adolescent with a recent severe ABI (mean age 15 years, 11 months) analysed using a grounded theory approach. Results. Two critical phases for adolescents returning to school post ABI were identified: organizing the school return and being back at school. Experience in these phases was influenced by length of school absence, extent of noticeable and hidden problems and school response to the students’ return post injury. The central concept characterizing experience was the challenge of <b>fitting</b> <b>back</b> in. Some adolescents fitted back in adequately and continued school participation. Those that did not fit in tried again by revisiting the organizing phase, re-evaluated their school experience and either continued or left school. Conclusions. Adolescents with ABI faced the challenge of <b>fitting</b> <b>back</b> in when they returned to school. This was either facilitated or hindered by the extent and quality of organization, communication and support from parents, schoolteachers and the rehabilitation team.

50|$|The {{new school}} has a more highly {{organized}} physical layout, looking like two 'E's <b>fitting</b> <b>back</b> to back, and a main corridor running down the middle, nicknamed 'The Street' by both pupils and teachers alike. Each branch teaches a different subject, with wings of varying lengths, the longest three being Admin/Reception, School Hall and Gymnasium, Science and D&T. Each floor within each wing also teaches a different subject, (e.g. the English wing is underneath the Maths wing). The Modern Foreign Languages wing {{used to be the}} shortest, under half the length of the others, until the new sixth form centre was added.|$|R
5000|$|Styles {{changed in}} the 17th century and men began to wear watches in pockets instead of as {{pendants}} (the woman's watch remained a pendant into the 20th century). This {{is said to have}} occurred in 1675 when Charles II of England introduced waistcoats. [...] This was {{not just a matter of}} fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. To fit in pockets, their shape evolved into the typical pocketwatch shape, rounded and flattened with no sharp edges. Glass was used to cover the face beginning around 1610. Watch fobs began to be used, the name originating from the German word fuppe, a small pocket. Later in the 1800s Prince Albert, the consort to Queen Victoria, introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. The watch was wound and also set by opening the <b>back</b> and <b>fitting</b> a key to a square arbor, and turning it.|$|R

50|$|In the joining {{of copper}} tube, failure to {{properly}} heat and fill a joint {{may lead to}} a 'void' being formed. This is usually a result of improper placement of the flame. If the heat of the flame is not directed at the <b>back</b> of the <b>fitting</b> cup, and the solder wire applied degrees opposite the flame, then solder will quickly fill the opening of the fitting, trapping some flux inside the joint. This bubble of trapped flux is the void; an area inside a soldered joint where solder is unable to completely fill the fittings' cup, because flux has become sealed inside the joint, preventing solder from occupying that space.|$|R
5000|$|During live performances, Steele {{remained}} backstage out {{of sight}} of the crowd. Despite praising him for <b>fitting</b> <b>back</b> into Slipknot well, Crahan justified this decision by asking [...] "What gives him the right to be onstage with us right now?", elaborating that [...] "When we're going through an experience like this with our fans, they need to concentrate on the eight members that are grieving, not on someone new". Steele only remained with the group for touring purposes, and was later replaced full-time by Alessandro Venturella in 2014, although he did record some bass parts for the band's 2014 fifth studio album [...]5: The Gray Chapter according to guitarist Jim Root.|$|R
50|$|A screw {{dislocation}} {{is much harder}} to visualize. Imagine cutting a crystal along a plane and slipping one half across the other by a lattice vector, the halves <b>fitting</b> <b>back</b> together without leaving a defect.This {{is similar to the}} Riemann surface of the complex logarithm.If the cut only goes part way through the crystal, and then slipped, the boundary of the cut is a {{screw dislocation}}. It comprises a structure in which a helical path is traced around the linear defect (dislocation line) by the atomic planes in the crystal lattice (Figure C). Perhaps the closest analogy is a spiral-sliced ham. In pure screw dislocations, the Burgers vector is parallel to the line direction.|$|R
5000|$|The {{perception}} of Škoda in Western Europe has completely {{changed since the}} takeover by VW, in stark comparison with {{the reputation of the}} cars throughout the 1980s—often described as [...] "the laughing stock" [...] of the automotive world. [...] As technical development progressed and attractive new models were marketed, Škoda's image was initially slow to improve. In the UK, a major turnabout was achieved with the ironic [...] "It is a Škoda, honest" [...] campaign, which began in 2000 when the Fabia launched. In a 2003 advertisement on British television, a new employee on the production line is fitting Škoda badges on the car bonnets. When some attractive looking cars come along he stands <b>back,</b> not <b>fitting</b> the badge, since they look so good they cannot be Škodas. This market campaign worked by confronting Škoda's image problem head-on — a tactic which marketing professionals regarded as high risk. By 2005 Škoda was selling over 30,000 cars a year in the UK, a market share of over 1%. For {{the first time in its}} UK history, a waiting list developed for deliveries from Škoda. UK owners have consistently ranked the brand at or near the top of customer satisfaction surveys since the late 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|Like The Creation, The Seasons was {{intended}} as a bilingual work. Since Haydn was very popular in England (particularly following his visits there in 1791-1792 and 1794-1795), he wished the work to be performable in English as well as German. Van Swieten therefore made a translation of his libretto <b>back</b> into English, <b>fitting</b> it to the rhythm of the music. Olleson notes that it is [...] "fairly rare" [...] that the translated version actually matches the Thomson original. Van Swieten's command of English was not perfect, and the English text he created has not always proven satisfying to listeners; for example, one critic writes, [...] "Clinging to the retranslation, however, is the heavy-handed imagery of Haydn's sincere, if officious, patron. Gone is the bloom of Thomson's original." [...] Olleson calls the English text [...] "often grotesque", and suggests that English-speaking choruses should perform the work in German: [...] "The Seasons is better served by the decent obscurity of a foreign language than by the English of the first version." [...] Van Swieten's words also show some inconsistency in tone, ranging from the rustically humorous (for instance, a movement depicting a wily peasant girl playing a trick on her rich suitor) to the uplifting (as in several large-scale choruses praising God for the beauty of nature).|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} results on {{utilizing}} image analysis techniques towards early lameness detection in dairy cattle are presented. Data {{from two different}} dairy farms in Belgium were gathered. Preprocessing on raw data is required because of non-predictable behaviours of cows such as stopping {{for a while in}} front of the camera or non-uniform walking behaviour during experiments. Prelocalization of cow in each frame has been done based on two steps separation: (1) A coarse estimation of moving objects was obtained through background subtraction, (2) second statistical analysis of intensities in gray-scale image along with binarization was utilized to detect moving object in video. A common problem in on-farm collected videos is the similarity of the background and the cow's body colour since the use of classic algorithms for segmentation purposes does not work. Here a hierarchy background/foreground exaggeration is proposed to segment the cow in each frame and track it in video. The combination of logarithm and exponential, background subtraction as well as statistical filtering are used to find the accurate shape of the cow. Furthermore, the back posture of each cow during standing and walking was extracted automatically. It was done by detecting the arc of <b>back</b> posture and <b>fitting</b> a circle through selected points on the spine line. The average inverse radius of four frames displaying the hind hoofs in contact with the ground (two frames for each hoof in a row) was assigned to the cow. Based on this curvature value, a score representing the status of lameness in the individual cow was given automatically. Experimental results from two different databases show promising results in automatic lameness detection based on back posture information. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{study is}} {{presented}} in which statistical methodologies were applied to evaluate the measurement of step gauges on an X-ray computed tomography (CT) system. In particular, the effects of step gauge material density and orientation were investigated. The step gauges consist of uni- and bidirectional lengths. By confirming the repeatability of measurements made on the test system, the number of required scans {{in the design of}} experiment (DOE) was reduced. The statistical model was checked using model adequacy principles; model adequacy checking is an important step in validating the applicability of a model to fitting experimental results. If the residuals after fitting the model are normally distributed (normality test), then the residuals represent random errors in the data. If the normality test is not satisfied, the model is said to fit the data poorly. If the model fit to the data were correct, the residuals would approximate the random errors (also called normality). The most common significance level is alpha = 0. 05; for normality to be satisfied, the P value for the residuals must not be smaller than 0. 05. The initial results show that the residuals failed the normality test due to a small P value (P < 0. 005). Some remedies in achieving a larger P value include (1) fitting a different model, (2) evaluating the data differently and (3) excluding outliers. The authors determined that there were too few data to delete outliers. Instead, discussions and conclusions were carried out based on main effect and interaction plots. It means that the conclusions were not based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The following conclusions can be drawn: X-ray scattering is more problematic for dense metal parts. Thus, the statement of "influence of orientation'' should be constrained by the material type. But {{it is important to have}} in mention that probably the repeatability of the vertical case is much worse. This can be documented experimentally, by tracing <b>back</b> to the <b>fitting</b> quality of the planes. The fitting point deviation of these planes are typically larger when dense metal step gauges are scanned vertically; this can also be done with simulation, as it is "assumed'' that the large errors related to "vertical direction'' might be caused by X-ray scattering noise, this theory can be tested by simulating CT scans of metal and plastic step gauge without X-ray scattering and see whether "vertical direction'' is still worse for aluminium step gauge. status: publishe...|$|R
