40|$|Soil erosion {{has been}} a major concern in the United States for over a century. Water erosion {{accounts}} for about two thirds of this erosion. Past researchers have divided the erosion process into rill and interrill erosion components. Rill erosion process can be further divided into scouring, headcutting and side sloughing subprocesses. Headcuts are defined as local areas of intense erosion accompanied by an abrupt elevation change. To more accurately model the rill erosion process, headcutting mechanics were developed to mathematically model the phenomenon;Headcut erosion data were collected on seven soils in six states as part of the USDA Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP). Rill plots 9 m long and 0. 5 m wide, were set up on 3 % to 6 % slopes. These plots were formed with <b>cultivator</b> <b>shovels.</b> A rotating boom rainfall simulator was used to simulate rainfall over the erosion plots. After equilibrium runoff was achieved, additional flows of 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 L/min were added to the top of each rill. During each flow addition, wooden stakes were placed adjacent to headcuts that formed in the rill and overhead stereo photographs were taken to determine the location of headcuts. Flow additions were repeated without rainfall. Headcut erosion was measured by calculating the volume of soil voided and multiplying this by the soil bulk density;Five models were developed using the principles of fluid mechanics. Statistical analyses indicated that two models, the total energy model and the vertical force model, were superior over other models tested. The energy model was based on the sum of the energy lost at each headcut. The vertical force model was based on the force in the plunge pool due to the flowing water. Coefficients of determination (r[superscript] 2) using the energy model and the vertical force model were 0. 85 and 0. 84, respectively. Soil properties were correlated to the erodibilities calculated with the two models. Organic carbon had the highest correlation for the energy model erodibilities with a correlation coefficient of - 0. 95. Soil shear angle had the highest correlation for the vertical force model with a correlation coefficient of - 0. 89...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural land packers are {{generally}} used following the seeding operation. It {{has been found}} that fields which have been packed usually give higher yields than those which have not been packed, although the reasons for this result are not understood. A laboratory study was undertaken to determine the effect of packing and the effect to determine the effect of packing and the effect of packer weight on soil density and moisture loss. A soil bin system was designed and constructed for the proposed study. The bulk density of the soil in the box was measured with a gamma ray density system. A 12 -inch <b>cultivator</b> <b>shovel</b> was used to till the soil before packing. Two agricultural land packers, a crowfoot and a coil type were used to pack the soil. Four different weights of packers ranging from 60 pounds to 160 pounds per foot of width were used for both packers at three depths of cultivation and at two moisture levels. Based upon the theoretical analysis of gamma transmission, a linear relationship was found between the count rate and the moisture content, and between the count rate and the dry bulk density. These relationships were used in determining the undisturbed bulk density of soil. It was found that the packed density of the soil was essentially the same for all packer weights used. No differences in packed density were detected with changes in depth of cultivation, moisture level, or the type of packer. The packed density increased with depth. Based upon these results an equation of packing was developed which related packed density to Depth. Experimental results were then checked against the theoretical calculations based upon a pressure-sinkage equation. Laboratory compaction tests and consolidation tests were carried out with a Proctor density apparatus and a consolidation apparatus respectively. The results from the compaction tests were compared with the experimental values. The Bossinesq equation was used to draw iso-pressure curves. Densities were calculated by graphical integration of iso-pressure curves using the density-pressure relationship obtained from the consolidation tests. A comparison was made between the densities obtained graphically and experimentally. The trend of calculated values was {{similar to that of the}} experimental values to a depth of four inches. A comparison of the moisture loss from a sample of soil which was cultivated only to that from a sample which was cultivated and packed showed no difference during a period of seven days...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{processing}} {{in plant}} production {{is a very}} impor-tant factor influencing the yield of a harvest. Also soil processing, not done {{in the right way}} and on time, re-duces the stability of yields and soil fertility. The main factor in soil processing is the clearing away of weeds, parasites and other diseases. Crucial also is the influ-ence of soil processing in the economical use of soil moisture. When producing huge amounts of crops, inap-propriate rainfall could have the main impact on yields. That is why we focus on the best results in reducing costs, lowering fuel consumption, time, working forces and soil consolidation. ANKEN et al. (1993) explain the requirements for studying the function of modern culti-vators. Similar conclusions were drawn by JÄGER and FUNK (1994). HŮLA and MAYER (1995) came to the same conclusions. They also examined in detail the fac-tors that influence the resistance of the working elements of the <b>shovel</b> <b>cultivator.</b> It is very important to know the exact weight and direction of forces over time Fx and Fz = f(t), because of finding out the impact of each factor on the need for energy during soil processing. MATERIAL AND METHODS Either the working parts of weeders or whole working sections have to be connected with a frame in order to follow the field’s surface independently and to achieve a constant depth of soil processing. This can be achieved thanks to the four-hinge mechanism (parallelogram or lever system). When designing the measuring equip-ment we took into account constructional solutions of one-hinge suspension with supporting wheel and the Device for measuring the forces influencing duckfoot share...|$|R
40|$|Five {{different}} varieties of corn were grown under varying {{conditions on the}} Experiment Station grounds during the past season, {{with a view to}} testing varieties, fertilizers, green manuring, and different methods of cultivation. The varieties grown were Mammoth Cuban, Early Mastodon, Red Cob Ensilage, King of the Earliest, and Capital. The Mammoth Cuban and Red Cob Ensilage varieties were planted April 29 th, the Early Mastodon on May 6 th, and the King of the Earliest on May 7 th, all on fall plowed ground, thoroughly cultivated and harrowed before planting, and rolled immediately after, as the soil was very dry. Scarcely any rain fell for three weeks following and the growth during this time was quite slow. On May 7 th we began plowing under five acres of winter rye, then about eight inches high, for corn. The plowing was finished on the 9 th, and a harrow followed the plow each day to prevent excessive drying and evaporation. One-hundred and sixty-three loads of well-rotted barn yard manure were applied {{at the same time and}} cultivated and harrowed in. In this condition the ground was planted four inches deep with Capital corn (an improved Learning variety), in drills about twelve inches between the kernels, with a single horse Champion drill planter,on May 12 th and 13 th. The ground was rolled immediately after planting and harrowed as soon as the corn began to come up, which was about ten days later. On May 13 th, one acre adjoining the five acre plat was plowed, and on May 14 th it was planted without manure. On the latter piece the rye had attained a height of about 14 inches. The plowing was all done at a depth of six inches, in order to cover the rye crop well and to insure its being far enough below the surface to prevent interfering with the cultivator. Both pieces were cultivated exactly the same during the entire season. All of the corn ground, on account of the severe drouth of May, was cultivated shallow the first time with an Albion spring-tooth ten <b>shovel</b> <b>cultivator</b> and harrowed with an A shaped harrow that covered two-thirds of the space on each side of a row without coming in contact with the corn. Following this, deep cultivation was given with an ordinary cultivator until the last time over, when a seven-shovel adjustable single horse cultivator, set to just cover the space between the rows, was used. This cultivator ran shallow and left the ground between the rows level. Most of the corn the last time over (July 10 to 15), was too large to have been cultivated in the ordinary way...|$|R
