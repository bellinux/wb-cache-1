5000|$|US Patent 4634021 describes: A release {{mechanism}} is disclosed for releasing an object {{such as a}} ball from a body under the force of gravity. A <b>bimetallic</b> <b>element</b> obstructs or opens {{an opening in the}} body for retaining or releasing the object depending upon the temperature of the <b>bimetallic</b> <b>element.</b> The {{release mechanism}} may be incorporated into a novelty [...] "brass monkey" [...] for [...] "emasculating" [...] the monkey when the temperature decreases to a predetermined temperature at which the balls in the [...] "brass monkey" [...] are permitted to drop to a base which is designed to produce an audible sound when struck by the balls.|$|E
50|$|Other units use a non-electrical approach, {{where the}} pilot heats a <b>bimetallic</b> <b>element</b> or a {{gas-filled}} tube to exert mechanical pressure {{to keep the}} gas valve open. If the pilot fails, the valve closes. To restart the system, the valve must be held open manually and the pilot lit, and then the valve must be held open until the element heats up {{enough to hold the}} valve open. Non-electrical schemes are appropriate for systems that do not use electricity.|$|E
5000|$|Older {{oil burners}} were {{equipped}} with a primary control installed on the exhaust stack with a <b>bimetallic</b> heat sensing <b>element</b> protruding into the stack, such a control {{was referred to as}} a [...] "stack relay" [...] or a [...] "stack control". It performed the same function as the newer cad-cell control but instead of sensing light from the burner flame it sensed heat from the flame exhaust gases to prove that ignition took place.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{reliable}} and hermetic joining {{of stainless steel}} to niobium pipes has been achieved with the explosive bonding technique. Joining of these two materials are essential to ensure production of a <b>bimetallic</b> transition <b>element</b> of pipe-type for its further use {{as a part of}} charged beam acceleration systems of the new generation. A non-destructive neutron diffraction investigation of the tri-axial strains along a radial cross-sectional line through the joint section has been performed. Residual stress results indicate inherently different natures in the residual stress values within the respective pipe sections. In the external stainless steel pipe the residual stresses are tensile, showing a sudden increase to 600 MPa as the interface is approached, whilst being compressive in the internal niobium pipe, not exceeding 650 MPa. A characteristic abrupt stress discontinuity exits at the interface region...|$|R
40|$|Cold welding on cogged {{surfaces}} {{is achieved}} by pressing an easy deformable metal (example aluminium) on a cogged surface of a harder component. The process requires accurate cleaning of contact area, where the cold welding is expected to occur. The joint was obtained only by plastic deformation of the Aluminium component on the harder one, made from Copper, Carbon or Stainless Steel, etc. The deformation of Aluminium is about 20 - 30 %. The welding on cogged surfaces of materials with different plasticity makes possible the production of <b>bimetallic</b> or multilayer <b>elements.</b> The weld tensile strength is up to 10 % of aluminium ultimate tensile strength, better results being obtained for the shearing strength. A thermal treatment {{can be used to}} over double the joint resistance, by activating the materials diffusion on the contact surface. The weld contact electric resistance is negligible, recommending the process for producing dissimilar elements used in electrotechnics...|$|R
40|$|Direct welding by cold {{pressing}} on cogged surfaces, produces the joint of a component made from an easy deformable metal by pressing on the cogged {{surface of a}} harder metal component. Different welds between aluminium (the easy deformable component) and copper, brass, steel, stainless steel (harder component, cogged on the contact surface) can be obtained. The experimental {{results show that the}} weld can be achieved at lower deformation rates than in the classical cold welding case. The weld is obtained only by deforming the aluminium component at a deformation rate of 20 … 20 %. The welding on cogged surfaces of materials with different plasticity makes possible the production of <b>bimetallic</b> or multilayer <b>elements.</b> The weld tensile strength is up to 10 % of aluminium ultimate tensile strength, better results being obtained for the shearing strength. The weld contact electric resistance is negligible, recommending the process for producing dissimilar elements used in electrotechnics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the internal structure of Au−Pd nanoparticles exhibiting newly discovered three-layer core/shell morphology, which {{is composed of}} an evenly alloyed inner core, an Au-rich intermediate layer, and a Pd-rich outer shell. By exploitation of spatially resolved imaging and spectroscopic and diffraction modes of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), insights were gained on the composition of {{each one of the}} observed three layers, indicating a significant extent of intimate alloy among the monometallic <b>elements.</b> <b>Bimetallic</b> nanoclusters attract great interest due to their unique catalytic, electronic, and optical properties {{different from those of the}} corresponding monometallic components. 1 - 5 It is well-known that adding a second metallic component enhances the activity, selectivity, and stability of pure metal catalysts. 6, 7 This behavior may originate from an ensemble or a ligand effect. 1 The properties of bimetallic nanoparticles can vary dramatically not only with size, as happens in monometallic nanoclusters, but also with chemical composi-tion. Controlling their structure and chemical ordering ca...|$|R
