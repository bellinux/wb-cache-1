Trip flares located in the concertina wire around the base were not always reset or replaced when they went off, a common occurrence caused in some cases by the rotor wash created by large CH-47 Chinook helicopters bringing in supplies or <b>backhauling</b> material as 1-46th Inf prepared to hand the base over to the ARVN. This lax attitude, combined with the skill of the attacking sappers, had fatal consequences for many in Charlie Company.

30|$|In this paper, <b>backhaul</b> {{challenges}} for small cells and potential solutions have been discussed. Considering various constraints of <b>backhaul</b> solutions such as cost, coverage, capacity and deployment flexibility, {{it was shown}} {{that there is no}} single <b>backhaul</b> solution for small cell <b>backhaul</b> and the optimum one relies on a synergy of different <b>backhaul</b> options. The proposed hybrid solution, which uses a combination of LOS, NLOS, PtP, PtMP and different frequency bands, proved to be the most cost effective. Thus, we conclude that <b>backhaul</b> planning is essential for appropriate small cell <b>backhaul</b> performance. Future trends in <b>backhaul</b> research such as LSAS, OWB, VLC and small cells that exploit advanced caching techniques were also discussed.|$|R
30|$|Since {{small cell}} BSs are {{deployed}} in larger numbers and should incur {{a much lower}} cost than macrocell BSs, the cost per small cell <b>backhaul</b> connection has to be significantly lower than that per macrocell <b>backhaul</b> connection.

30|$|Throughput results {{obtained}} from the simulation campaign assert that the CoMP scheme significantly improves the capacity gap between <b>backhaul</b> and access. For instance, the gap is reduced by 86.00 % at the 50 %-ile when we allocate 60 % of the LTE subframes for the <b>backhaul.</b> The enhancement is accompanied by an approximately 80 % RUE throughput gain at 50 %-ile. When 30 % of the subframes are allocated for the <b>backhaul,</b> we note a relatively higher RUE throughput gain at the 10 %-ile and 50 %-ile (compared to the case with 60 % of subframes allocated for the <b>backhaul).</b> Besides, {{we can use the}} CoMP gain at the <b>backhaul</b> to increase the percentage of subframes for MUE (decrease subframes for <b>backhaul)</b> so that throughput is improved not only for RUEs but also for MUEs. We observe that CoMP with 30 % <b>backhaul</b> subframes provides 26.38 % throughput gain for all UEs at 50 %-ile relative to the case of non-CoMP with 60 % <b>backhaul</b> subframes. Furthermore, the fairness index shows that the use of CoMP for LPN <b>backhaul</b> provides more even throughput distribution among UEs in both 60 % and 30 % subframe configurations for the <b>backhaul.</b> Although these CoMP performance gains are sustained under feedback error, it was also noted that considerable reduction in the gains are observed for large bit-error probability (≥ 10 %).|$|R

40|$|The {{deluge of}} date rate in today’s {{networks}} imposes a cost {{burden on the}} <b>backhaul</b> network design. Developing costefficient <b>backhaul</b> solutions becomes an exciting, yet challenging, problem. Traditional technologies for <b>backhaul</b> networks include either radio-frequency <b>backhauls</b> (RF) or optical fibers (OF). While RF is a cost-effective solution as compared to OF, it supports lower data rate requirements. Another promising <b>backhaul</b> solution is the free-space optics (FSO) as it offers both a high data rate and a relatively low cost. FSO, however, is sensitive to nature conditions, e. g., rain, fog, line-of-sight. This paper combines both RF and FSO advantages and proposes a hybrid RF/FSO <b>backhaul</b> solution. It considers the problem of minimizing {{the cost of the}} <b>backhaul</b> network by choosing either OF or hybrid RF/FSO <b>backhaul</b> links between the basestations (BS) so as to satisfy data rate, connectivity, and reliability constraints. It shows that under a specified realistic assumption about the cost of OF and hybrid RF/FSO links, the problem is equivalent to a maximum weight clique problem, which can be solved with moderate complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed solution shows a close-to-optimal performance, especially for reasonable prices of the hybrid RF/FSO links. They further reveal that the hybrid RF/FSO is a cost-efficient solution and a good candidate for upgrading existing <b>backhaul</b> networks...|$|R
