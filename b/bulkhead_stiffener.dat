5000|$|The hull was {{designed}} with constant flare at the waterline for ice-going. The structure was longitudinally framed with heavy web frames and an ice belt of heavy plating, {{and it had}} extra transverse framing {{above and below the}} design waterline. An enormous amount of weight was saved utilizing the technique of electric welding. The 250 ft cutters' weights were used for estimating purposes. Tapered <b>bulkhead</b> <b>stiffeners</b> cut from 12" [...] I-beams went from the main deck (4' depth of web) to the bottom (8" [...] depth of web). As weight was cut out of the hull structure, electronics and ordnance were increased, but at much greater heights. This top weight required ballasting the fuel tanks with seawater to maintain stability both for wind and damaged conditions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Catamaran is a dual hull ship {{which has}} many {{advantages}} then the mono hull ship. Some {{of the advantages}} are excellent stability, Cruise in shallow water, large wide deck areas, large load carrying capacity, faster and Motion comfort etc. In this paper work, design of main or strength deck and Bulkhead structural member calculations for Catamaran ship used for transport for the crane (Mantis ® 10010 mx 46 ton tele-boom crawler crane) to its place of work. Ship’s main deck or Strength deck hull structural scantlings or calculations play a very vital role in carrying the deck loads such as crane load safely against the external pressures which are acting on the deck. This can done by designing the suitable deck and hull plate thickness, and it’s strengthening stiffening. The design of main deck involves determination of scantlings of deck plate, deck plate <b>stiffeners,</b> girders, pillars, <b>Bulkhead</b> and its <b>stiffeners</b> against the wheel load. Scantlings of deck and <b>Bulkhead</b> plates, <b>stiffeners</b> and girders to meet the local strength requirements are to be determined {{in accordance with the}} general principles of the rules. Scantlings of hull members should contribute the longitudinal strength of the ship and to be subjected to compressive stresses. The design calculations are carried out according to Indian Register of shipping (IRS) Rules and Regulations, Construction & Classification of steel ships July 2013. This design process gives the effective & efficient solutions to the new generation ships...|$|R

Two torpedoes struck the port side. One detonated below the armor belt at frame 52 (between number 2 turret and the bridge), creating a hole 10 ft high and 24 ft long, destructively deforming the first antitorpedo <b>bulkhead</b> and transverse <b>stiffeners</b> between frames 47 and 60, and holing the second bulkhead with fragments. Watertight integrity had been impaired by preparations for a material inspection; {{and the ship}} suffered extensive flooding damage when hit.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{technique is}} {{used to measure the}} structural power flow through an aircraft fuselage with the excitation near the wing attachment location. Because of the large number of measurements required to analyze the whole of an aircraft fuselage, it is necessary that a balance be achieved between the number of measurement transducers, the mounting of these transducers, and the accuracy of the measurements. Using four transducers mounted on a bakelite platform, the structural intensity vectors at locations distributed throughout the fuselage are measured. To minimize the errors associated with using a four transducers technique the measurement positions are selected away from <b>bulkheads</b> and <b>stiffeners.</b> Because four separate transducers are used, with each transducer having its own drive and conditioning amplifiers, phase errors are introduced in the measurements that can be much greater than the phase differences associated with the measurements. To minimize these phase errors two sets of measurements are taken for each position with the orientation of the transducers rotated by 180 deg and an average taken between the two sets of measurements. Results are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{technique is}} used to measure structural intensity through an aircraft fuselage with an excitation load applied {{near one of the}} wing attachment locations. The fuselage is a relatively large structure, requiring a large number of measurement locations to analyze the whole of the structure. For the measurement of structural intensity, multiple point measurements are necessary at every location of interest. A tradeoff is therefore required between the number of measurement transducers, the mounting of these transducers, and the accuracy of the measurements. Using four transducers mounted on a bakelite platform, structural intensity vectors are measured at locations distributed throughout the fuselage. To minimize the errors associated with using the four transducer technique, the measurement locations are selected to be away from <b>bulkheads</b> and <b>stiffeners.</b> Furthermore, to eliminate phase errors between the four transducer measurements, two sets of data are collected for each position, with the orientation of the platform with the four transducers rotated by 180 degrees and an average taken between the two sets of data. The results of these measurements together with a discussion of the suitability of the approach for measuring structural intensity on a real structure are presented...|$|R
40|$|Excitation {{of the low}} {{frequency}} vibrational modes of a submerged vessel can generate significant radiated noise levels. Vibrational modes of a submarine hull are excited from the transmission of fluctuating forces through the shaft and thrust bearings due to the propeller rotating in an unsteady fluid. The focus of this work is to investigate the structural and acoustic responses of a submarine hull under axial excitation. The submarine hull is modelled as a cylindrical shell with internal <b>bulkheads</b> and ring <b>stiffeners.</b> The cylindrical shell is closed by truncated conical shells, which in turn are closed at each end using circular plates. The entire structure is submerged in a heavy fluid medium. The structural responses of the submerged vessel are calculated by solving the cylindrical shell equations of motion using a wave approach and the conical shell equations with a power series solution. The displacement normal {{to the surface of}} the structure in contact with the fluid medium was calculated by assembling the boundary/continuity matrix. The far field radiated sound pressure was then calculated by means of the Helmholtz integral. Results from the analytical model are compared with computational results from a fully coupled finite element/boundary element model. The individual and combined effects of the various influencing factors, corresponding to the ring <b>stiffeners,</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> conical end closures and fluid loading, on the structural and acoustic responses are characterised by examining the contribution by the circumferential modes. It is shown that equally spaced internal bulkheads generate a periodic structure thus creating a grouping effect for the higher circumferential modes, but do not have strong influence on the sound radiation. Stiffeners are found to have an important effect on both the dynamic and acoustic responses of the hull. The contribution of the conical end closures on the radiated sound pressure for the lowest circumferential mode numbers is also clearly observed. This work shows the importance of the bending modes when evaluating the sound pressure radiated by a submarine under harmonic excitation from the propulsion system...|$|R
40|$|History on {{corrosion}} {{of tanks}} The chemical tanker started exploitation in February 2000. The cargo acid tanks {{have been constructed}} from 22 % Cr, 5, 5 % Ni, nitrogen enhanced duplex stainless steel 2205. The cargoes that have been shipped were sulphuric acid (12 journeys), caustic soda (1 journey) and phosphoric acid DFL or MGA (15 journeys). Voyages were mostly along the western American coast. The vessel passed guarantee repair work one year after construction. Ship designing was not satisfactory. The cargo acid tanks got external reinforcement of some transverse <b>bulkheads,</b> got internal <b>stiffeners</b> and passed second mineral acid passivation. After {{two and a half}} years after construction external reinforcement of some transverse bulkheads and pad eyes for hanging stages were fitted. Trace weld leakages were discovered in two tanks ({{two and a half years}} after construction). Small openings at transversal bulkhead/bottom weld in one tank were found eight months later. Weld repairs and third mineral acid passivation were performed. At that time heavy grinding work to remove rust was carried out. After four years of exploitation cracks of weld...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{numerical}} model is proposed for predicting the scattering pressure by a fluid-loaded cylindrical shell stiffened by axisymmetric internal frames and impacted by an acoustic plane wave. The proposed developments consist in {{an extension of}} the Circumferential Admittance Approach (CAA) [Maxit, et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 128, 137 - 151 (2010) ] to an obliquely incident plane wave excitations. CAA consists in assembling a {{numerical model}} of the fluid loaded shell with finite element models of the internal frames. The scattering pressure model deduced from CAA can then take into account: (a), internal frames having a cross section with a complex geometry and thickness variations (like T-shaped <b>stiffeners,</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> hemispherical end caps); (b), variations of the frame spacings; (c), the frame-shell coupling in the three translational directions and the tangential rotation. Comparison with numerical and experimental results of the literature for a periodic stiffened shell shows that the scattering from Bragg, Bloch-Floquet, and Helical waves are correctly predicted. The effects on the backscattering pressure of the axial and tangential coupling forces are highlighted. Finally, an example of non-periodically stiffened shell is presented to highlight the versatility of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|The wave-induced {{strains of}} the shipp's hull {{structural}} elements are interrupted during the lay time in the port. During loading and unloading the smooth water strains are varying. These variations of strains influence the fatigue life of structural elements. So welded cruciform specimens made of steel D 36 have been investigated unter unchanged random loading, random loading with static loads, random loading with static loads and single peak loads and random loading with alternating static loads. The experimental results are compared with the calculated fatigue life to the nominal strain concept and the local strain concept. For the calculation of the stress concentration factor the FE-programme ANSYS has been applied. Also single edge cracks made of steel D 36 have been investigated under the above mentioned loadings. The experimental results are compared with the calculated crack lengths according to the linear and nonlinear concept. Connection of transverse <b>bulkhead</b> longitudinal <b>stiffeners</b> with one- side- and double connection have been investigated under static loads and random loading. The linear and nonlinear computation of stress distribution and the calculation of the concentration factor the FE-programme ANSYS has been applied. The experimental results under static loads show that the computation of the linear stress distribution can be predicted with sufficient accuracy. Results under random loading show that the crack initiation life is comparable with the calculated fatigue life according to the nominal strain concept and the local strain concept. The nonlinear calculated crack lengths are comparable with the experimental crack lengths for these complex structures. Final welded single edge cracks made of steel D 36 without and with natural stress have been investigated under the above-mentioned loadings. The experimental results are compared with the calculated crack lengths according to a nonlinear mixed mode concept. (orig.)
