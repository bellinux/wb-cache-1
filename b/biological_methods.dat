25|$|White pepper {{consists}} solely of {{the seed}} of the pepper plant, with the darker-coloured skin of the pepper fruit removed. This is usually accomplished by {{a process known as}} retting, where fully ripe red pepper berries are soaked in water for about a week, during which the flesh of the pepper softens and decomposes. Rubbing then removes what remains of the fruit, and the naked seed is dried. Sometimes alternative processes are used for removing the outer pepper from the seed, including removing the outer layer through mechanical, chemical, or <b>biological</b> <b>methods.</b>|$|E

25|$|Physical, chemical, and <b>biological</b> <b>methods</b> {{have been}} used to {{remediate}} arsenic contaminated water. Bioremediation is said to be cost effective and environmentally friendly Bioremediation of ground water contaminated with arsenic aims to convert arsenite, the toxic form of arsenic to humans, to arsenate. Arsenate (+5 oxidation state) is the dominant form of arsenic in surface water, while arsenite (+3 oxidation state) is the dominant form in hypoxic to anoxic environments. Arsenite is more soluble and mobile than arsenate. Many species of bacteria can transform arsenite to arsenate in anoxic conditions by using arsenite as an electron donor. This is a useful method in ground water remediation. Another bioremediation strategy is to use plants that accumulate arsenic in their tissues via phytoremediation but the disposal of contaminated plant material needs to be considered.|$|E

2500|$|These {{processes}} {{also were}} included in early fermentation of beer. These processes were introduced in early Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and India, and still use the same basic <b>biological</b> <b>methods.</b> [...] In brewing, malted grains (containing enzymes) convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding specific yeasts to produce beer. In this process, carbohydrates in the grains were broken down into alcohols such as ethanol. Later other cultures produced the process of lactic acid fermentation which allowed the fermentation and preservation of other forms of food, such as soy sauce. Fermentation was also used in this time period to produce leavened bread. Although the process of fermentation was not fully understood until Louis Pasteur's work in 1857, {{it is still the}} first use of biotechnology to convert a food source into another form.|$|E

Orthogonal array of L 9 type was applied as an experimental design to analyze the results and to determine optimum conditions for synthesis of silver nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles are synthesized by <b>biological</b> <b>method</b> using Fungus Aspergillus terreus (Thom) MTCC 6324. Addition of silver ions to the biomass of fungi and temperature of reaction are investigated. The effect of these factors on the particle size of synthesized silver nanoparticles was quantitatively studied by the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed that silver nanoparticles can be synthesized by controlling silver concentration, biomass of fungi and temperature. The synthesized silver nanoparticles are characterized using X-Ray diffraction, and UV- visible spectrophotometer. Shape of synthesized silver nanoparticles was studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy and elemental composition of nanoparticles was determined using electron diffraction spectrum. The result showed that silver nanoparticles can be synthesized by <b>biological</b> <b>method</b> using Taguchi Design which was of spherical in shaped and average particle diameter was 2. 18 nm.

The <b>biological</b> <b>method</b> for extracting chitin from seafood waste is a cost-effective and green process as no chemical is used compared to the chemical extraction. However, the <b>biological</b> <b>method</b> requires time and controlled fermentation conditions such as initial pH, temperature, active culture, type and concentration of supplements, type and concentration of carbon and nitrogen sources, inoculum size, etc. Microbial contamination of the products obtained from <b>biological</b> extraction <b>methods</b> is another important aspect. Moreover, {{there is a lack of}} single-stage extraction process for obtaining pure chitin product as in most of the fermentation processes, the product contains large amount of protein which comes along with the deproteination process. It is further stated that the removal of this residual protein may be performed by chemical method.|$|R
