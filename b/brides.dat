5|$|The War <b>Brides</b> Act of 1945, and {{subsequent}} Alien Fiancées and Fiancés Act of 1946, continued to apply {{until the end}} of 1953, allowing veterans of the Regiment, and other Filipino American veterans, to return to the Philippines to bring back fiancées, wives, and children. In the years following the war, some sixteen thousand Filipinas entered the United States as war <b>brides.</b> These new Filipino American families formed a second generation of Filipino Americans, significantly expanding the Filipino American community.|$|E
5|$|In the Balkand {{episode of}} the {{marriage}} of the princes of Ayodhya with the princesses of Mithila, Tulsidas presents a metaphor in which the four <b>brides</b> are compared with the four states of consciousness – the waking state (Jagrat), sleep with dreams (Swapna), dreamless sleep (Sushupti) and the fourth self-conscious state (Turiya). The four grooms are compared with the presiding divinity (Vibhu) of the four states – Vishva, Taijasa, Prajna and Brahman. Tulsidas says as the four states of consciousness with their presiding divinities reside {{in the mind of}} a Jiva, so the four <b>brides</b> with their grooms are resplendent in the same pavilion.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} festival {{for the new}} <b>brides</b> is Mangala Gaur. It {{is celebrated}} on any Tuesday of Shravana and involves the worship of lingam, a gathering of womenfolk and narrating limericks or Ukhane using their husbands' first name. The women may also play traditional games such as Jhimma, and Fugadi, or more contemporary activities such as Bhendya till {{the wee hours of}} the next morning.|$|E

2500|$|Islamic marriages require acceptance, in [...] , of the groom, the <b>bride</b> and {{the consent}} of the {{custodian}} (wali) of the <b>bride.</b> The wali of the <b>bride</b> is normally a male relative of the <b>bride,</b> preferably her father.

5000|$|Paying {{the ransom}} - The groom {{must go to}} the <b>bride's</b> parents' house and offer a ransom to get his <b>bride.</b> The bridesmaids protect the <b>bride</b> from getting [...] "stolen" [...] without a ransom. First, the groom offers {{something}} valuable, usually money or jewellery for the <b>bride.</b> The parents of the <b>bride</b> bring out a woman or man dressed as the <b>bride</b> and covered with a veil, so the groom can't see her face. When the groom realizes that it is not his <b>bride,</b> he asks for his true love, and the family demands a bigger ransom because she is valuable. Once the ransom is negotiated, the <b>bride's</b> family offers the <b>bride</b> to the groom.|$|R
5|$|Classical Athenian girls {{probably}} reached menarche {{at about}} age fourteen, {{when they would}} have married. Girls who died before marriage were mourned for their failure to reach maturity. Memorial vases for dead girls in classical Athens often portrayed them dressed as <b>brides,</b> and were sometimes shaped like loutrophoroi (vases which held water used to bathe before the wedding day).|$|E

She continued in this role until laid up in the Reserve Fleet at Brunswick, Georgia, in 1947. Bridgeport was sold as surplus in February 1948 and broken up for scrap later that year at Mobile, Alabama.|$|E

50|$|Episodes are {{intended}} to run in sequence, as a single <b>bride's</b> story is told over two episodes. For example, the start of <b>Bride</b> B's story will be presented {{in tandem with the}} conclusion of <b>Bride</b> A's story.

50|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the <b>bride's</b> home, the procession lights fireworks to alert the <b>bride's</b> family, who then lights its own round of firecrackers to welcome the groom's procession. Members of the procession are introduced to the <b>bride's</b> family, and the <b>bride's</b> family introduces its members to the procession. The groom presents his gifts to the <b>bride's</b> family, and he is given permission to greet the <b>bride,</b> who is finally brought out.|$|R
50|$|In many Ashkenazi Orthodox communities, the <b>bride</b> {{typically}} {{does not}} attend the aufruf because it is customary for the <b>bride</b> and groom to refrain from seeing each other for one week before the wedding. On the Shabbat before the wedding, the <b>bride's</b> family, the <b>bride's</b> friends, and women from the community gather to celebrate the <b>bride,</b> bring her joy, make her laugh, and help keep away the last-minute jitters. This is called a Shabbat Kallah, the <b>bride's</b> Sabbath.|$|R
5|$|The {{painting}} depicts 125 wedding guests. As was customary in the Renaissance period, the <b>brides</b> {{wore black}} and men wore codpieces. Voyeurism is depicted {{throughout the entire}} art work; dancing was disapproved of by the authorities and the church, and the painting {{can be seen as}} both a critique and comic depiction of a stereotypical oversexed, overindulgent, peasant class of the times.|$|E

She {{then returned to}} Atlantic waters before being selected for conversion to an Army transport in January 1946. Reclassified as a United States Army Transport (USAT) and resuming operation under her old name, USAT Bridgeport was reconfigured to carry war <b>brides</b> and other military dependents at the Todd Shipyard in Hoboken, New Jersey. She made several voyages between England and the United States in this capacity, operating well into 1947.|$|E
2500|$|The {{marriage}} contract is concluded between the wali, or guardian, of the <b>bride</b> and bridegroom, not between bridegroom and <b>bride</b> [...] The wali of the <b>bride</b> {{can only be}} a free Muslim. The wali of the <b>bride</b> is normally a male relative of the <b>bride,</b> preferably her father. If the <b>bride</b> is a virgin, the wali mujbir, that is her father or paternal grandfather, can not force the <b>bride</b> into the marriage against her proclaimed will; according to most scholars. According to Khomeini and Ali al-Sistani, both Shia scholars (both having the degrees mujtahid and marja'), and also almost all contemporary scholars, the marriage is invalid without <b>bride's</b> free consent and no obligation can make marriage official and legal.|$|R

5|$|Many Indonesian batik {{patterns}} are symbolic. Infants are carried in batik slings decorated with symbols {{designed to bring}} the child luck, and certain batik designs are reserved for <b>brides</b> and bridegrooms, {{as well as their}} families. Some designs are reserved for royalties, and even banned to be worn by commoners. Consequently, a person's rank could be determined by the pattern of the batik he or she wore. Further study to the geometry of symbolism in Indonesian batik showed the applicability of fractal geometry in traditional designs.|$|E
5|$|Montana Moon (1930), {{an uneasy}} mix of Western clichés and music, teamed her with John Mack Brown and Ricardo Cortez.

Our Blushing <b>Brides</b> (1930), co-starring Robert Montgomery and Anita Page, was the final installment in the so-called Our Dancing Daughters franchise. It was a greater successboth critically and financiallythan her previous talkies, and became one of her personal favorites.|$|E
5|$|Most middle {{aged and}} young women in urban Maharashtra dress in western outfits such as skirts and {{trousers}} or shalwar kameez with the traditionally nauvari or nine-yard sari, disappearing from the markets {{due to a lack}} of demand. Older women wear the five-yard sari. Traditionally, Brahmin women in Maharashtra, unlike those of other castes, did not cover their head with the end of their saree. In urban areas, the five-yard sari is worn by younger women for special occasions such as marriages and religious ceremonies. Maharashtrian <b>brides</b> prefer the very Maharashtrian saree – the Paithani – for their wedding day.|$|E
50|$|A shotgun {{wedding is}} a wedding {{in which the}} groom is {{reluctant}} to marry the <b>bride,</b> however, is strongly encouraged to do so to avoid family, social or legal repercussions.

During the shooting of Seven <b>Brides</b> for Seven Brothers, Donen often complained about his budgetary constraints, while Brigadoon had a much larger budget.

5|$|Several {{women were}} lined up as {{possible}} <b>brides</b> for Albert Victor.

She would later marry Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, another of Albert Victor's cousins, in 1894. The second, in 1890, was a love match with Princess Hélène of Orléans, a daughter of Prince Philippe, Count of Paris, a pretender to the French throne who was living in England after being banished from France in 1886.|$|E
5|$|The carrier {{arrived at}} Portsmouth Dockyard on 16 March 1946.

Indefatigable continued on to Sydney, where she embarked a complete naval hospital, with patients, and over 1,000 RN officers and ratings. She departed on 9 June and arrived at Plymouth on 7 July. Her next voyage involved transporting a much smaller number of men to Malta and Colombo; only 47 officers and 67 ratings, most of whom left the ship at Malta. When she arrived at Colombo on 15 August, she loaded a full complement of passengers from all three services to return to the UK. The ship arrived at Portsmouth on 9 September and her next voyage involved over 1,200 RN personnel and civilians ferried to Malta, Colombo, and Singapore where almost 1,300 personnel embarked. She returned to Portsmouth on 29 November and began a brief refit in preparation for her final trooping voyage. Indefatigable sailed empty for Norfolk, Virginia, where she loaded RN personnel before returning to Portsmouth on 21 November. The next month, she was placed in reserve and Captain MacIntyre retired on 7 January 1947.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the groom}} {{arrives at the}} <b>bride’s</b> home, he must pay a ransom for the <b>bride,</b> a term in Russian known as vykup nevesty.

When the groom realizes that it is not his <b>bride,</b> he asks for his love, but the family of the <b>bride</b> will demand a bigger ransom to be paid.

He secretly begins to fawn over Tati, although he does not tell her the reason.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to provide {{evidence}} about the relationship between <b>bride</b> price payments and fertility decisions in the African context. Remarkably, the results show that <b>bride</b> price payments reduce fertility pressure, with a woman reducing her number of children by 0. 5 at the mean <b>bride</b> price. The results are robust to different tests that we conduct to address the potential endogeneity between <b>bride</b> price payments and fertility decisions. As possible transmission channels, we find that poor women and men with low levels of education are the most negatively affected by the tradition of <b>bride</b> price payments. Furthermore, a lower <b>bride</b> price payment increases fertility pressure in polygamous households and for arranged marriages, while the <b>bride</b> price payment has no effect on the couple's decisions concerning fertility in monogamous households and for love marriages. Consequently, given that <b>bride</b> price payments have less power over (economically) independent women, empowerment will give leeway to girls in traditional societies, even if the <b>bride</b> price system is not overturned...|$|R
