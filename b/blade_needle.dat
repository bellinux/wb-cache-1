40|$|Background: Foreign {{bodies in}} the upper {{digestive}} tube are rarely the cause of an urgent condition in gastroenterology. They usually enter the digestive tube during nutrition or by mistake. However, certain groups of the population such as convicts or psychiatric patients tend to swallow them intentionally. The authors aim {{was to assess the}} percentage of patients in which urgent endoscopic investigation revealed true foreign {{bodies in the}} upper digestive tube, to evaluate the success of endoscopic procedures and the resolution of eventual complications. Patients and methods: The study includes patients in which urgent endoscopic investigations of the upper digestive tract were performed in a 10 -year period (1 January 1994 to 31 December 2003). Results: Altogether 6416 patients were investigated, mean age 59. 3 years, SD ± 17. 2 years, range 1 – 106 years, 2452 females and 3964 males. In 51 patients, 0. 8 % of all subjects, foreign bodies were detected in the esophagus or stomach. In these patients a total of 65 endoscopic investigations were performed, in 94 % the foreign bodies were removed endoscopically (48 / 51 patients), in three cases the endoscopic procedures were not successful. Among the foreign bodies removed were various metal or plastic objects: coins, keys, screws, hooks, batteries, razor <b>blades,</b> <b>needles,</b> parts of kitchen, toilet or writing utensils, lighters, buttons, toys, a toothbrush as well as impacted pieces of bone. In the patients with successful endoscopic removal of the objects, no significant complications were noted. In 3 patients (3 / 48, 6. 3 %) only mild hemorrhages from the region of the esophagogastric junction were observed. Conclusions: The technological development of endoscopic instruments made it possible to carry out different therapeutic procedures. The method has proved successful in removing foreign bodies from the upper digestive tube. Various factors affect the success of the procedure, the more important being adequate equipment, the experience and patience of the investigator and the assisting nurse, as well as the patient’s understanding of the procedure and his or her cooperation. </p...|$|R

50|$|As {{part of a}} tax {{obligation}} to the commoners, mining was required in all the provinces. Even though the Inca Empire contained a lot of precious metals, the Incans did not value their metal as much as fine cloth. The Incans adopted much of their metal-working characteristics from the metalwork of Chimu. Because of their expertise in metalworking, {{after the fall of}} Chimu many metalworkers were taken back to the capital city of Cuzco to continue their metalworking for the emperor. Copper, tin, gold, and silver were all obtained from mines or washed from the river gravels. These metals would then be handed over to metallurgists. Because the Inca had a system that emphasized political and religious organization, there were many specialized artisans like metallurgists. There were also specialized weavers, cloth makers, pottery makers, and many more. Both copper and bronze would be used for basic farming tools or weapons. Some of the common bronze and copper pieces found in the Incan empire included sharp sticks for digging, club-heads, knives with curved <b>blades,</b> axes, chisels, <b>needles</b> and pins. All of these items would be forged by a metallurgist and then spread throughout the empire.|$|R

The {{penetration force}} was measured by Simple Compression Tester with a sewing needle and a specimen holder attached to it. Many kinds of woven fabrics were used and the needle diameters were varied four times. As a result, the penetration force, W_ increases exponentially with r/R (r; the radius of <b>needle</b> <b>blade,</b> R; the radius of throat plate hole), which is shown by a following formula; W_ =K(r/R) ^n. While n is constant; n= 3, K depends on the sample fabrics and is estimated from the fabric property value, X_i, using the following formula, K=C・X_ 1 ^ ・X_ 2 ^ ・X_ 3 ^ …X_i^. C and a_i are constant, and a_i is determined by X_i. The formula was derived by the stepwise residual regression method. X_i is determined on the four fabric properties of shear stiffness, weave density, weight and compression energy.

40|$|This {{research}} advances {{knowledge in}} needle cutting of tissue {{leading to the}} invention and validation of the enhanced cutting edge (ECE) biopsy needle. Biopsy needle tip cutting edge geometry is defined using analytical models. With these geometrical definitions a mechanistic force model is developed to predict the needle insertion force for a given needle geometry. The force model then leads {{to the development of}} the improved ECE needle tip geometry. Needle biopsy is one of the most common medical procedures to cut and remove tissue for pathological diagnosis. Currently little study has focused on hollow needle tissue cutting. This lack of knowledge has led to the use of biopsy needles and devices that are inefficient at cutting tissue, thereby hindering the accuracy of the diagnosis, increasing the discomfort to the patient, and lengthening the procedure time. This dissertation directly fills this void in hollow needle tissue cutting knowledge to improve the yield of biopsy and advance the understanding of hollow needle tissue cutting in biopsy. This study is conducted in four topics that build on each other to reach the ultimate goal of developing the novel ECE biopsy needle. First, analytical models of needle geometry are developed for identification of inclination angle, normal rake angle, needle tip insertion length, and needle tip area on a variety of flat plane and curved needle tips. Second, oblique tissue cutting is studied through <b>blade</b> and <b>needle</b> tissue cutting experiments and three analytical models are developed to describe tissue flow angle and needle contact length. Third, a general hollow needle insertion force model is developed to predict needle insertion force. Fourth, a novel ECE needle tip is developed based on positive geometrical characteristics discovered by the force model for cutting tissue. This ECE needle is validated against a regular style needle and shown to produce longer biopsy sample lengths. This research aims to improve the procedure of needle biopsy through increasing fundamental knowledge in needle cutting mechanics and developing the improved needle geometry of the ECE needle. This research can lead to more accurate biopsy diagnosis, lower patient discomfort, and shorter procedure time...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{most common}} laparoscopic {{complications}} {{are associated with}} trocar insertion. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop an objective method of evaluating the safety profile of various access devices used in laparoscopic surgery. STUDY DESIGN: In 20 swine, 6 <b>bladed</b> and 2 <b>needle</b> access devices were evaluated. A force profile was determined by measuring the force required to drive the trocar or needle through the fascia and into the peritoneum, at 0 and 10 mmHg. The amount Of tissue deformation, the length of blade exposed, and the duration of exposure were measured using a high-speed digital imaging system. RESULTS: The needle system without the sheath required the least driving force and had the most favorable force profile. In contrast, the bladed, nonretractable trocar system required a higher driving force and a rapid loss of resistance. Insertion under a pneumoperitoneum did not significantly alter the force profile of the various access devices except for the amount of tissue deformation. With the bladed system, the blade itself was exposed for an average of 0. 5 to 1. 0 seconds for a distance of 4. 5 to 5. 0 cm. In comparison, the needle system was exposed for 0. 2 seconds for a distance of 1. 8 cm. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a reproducible method of measuring the forces required to place the access systems, their pattern of resistance loss, and the characteristics of the blade exposure. These parameters may provide an adjunctive and objective measurement of safety, allowing for more direct comparison between various trocar designs. (J Am Coll Surg 2009; 209 : 222 - 232.

40|$|Background: Needle stick {{injuries}} (NSIs) {{caused by}} sharp instruments such as hypodermic needles, blood collection needles; intravenous (IV) cannula or needles used to connect parts of IV delivery system {{are common in}} clinical practice. A potential risk of transmission of various fatal diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, hepatitis {{and others have been}} a matter of serious concern in busy clinical settings. Aim and Objectives: The present survey study was carried out to evaluate the prevalence of NSIs among nursing personnel of our institute so as to identify the potential risk factors responsible for possibly acquiring NSIs. The study also aims to reinforce uniformly the recommended preventive measures by the nursing personnel in our institute with the formulation and implementation of newer preventive strategies by hospital authorities. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out from July 2012 to November 2012 in the nursing department of our hospital. Informed verbal consent was taken from nursing personnel prior to distribution of the self-reporting questionnaire. Questions related to awareness such as cause of NSIs, number of NSIs, procedures that caused NSIs, clinical response of personnel after injury, preventive measures like hepatitis B immunization, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and reasons for not using the PPE and training regarding prevention of NSIs were also included. A total of 179 staff nurses from all clinical areas of the hospital participated in this study excluding those who were on any kind of long leave. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 15 for windows and value of P < 0. 05 was considered as significant and P < 0. 001 as highly significant. Results: Almost {{more than half of the}} nursing personnel (57. 5 %) had NSIs at one occasion or the other. Nearly 58 % nursing personnel had NSIs for 3 -times and few had even more than 10 times. NSIs during bedside care of the patient (57. 2 %) were reported as one of the significant potentially vulnerable location to get the NSIs as compared with the operation theater and emergency (5 %) areas (P < 0. 001). About 92 % of the nursing personnel reported that needles used in routine injection practices were the main instrument that caused NSIs as compared with the hypodermic <b>needle</b> and surgical <b>blades.</b> Recapping of <b>needles</b> (66 %) was the main procedure that caused NSIs as compared to IV line (20. 4 %) and others (P < 0. 001). Around 81 % nurses were already vaccinated against hepatitis B before the survey study. Conclusion: NSIs are highly prevalent among nurses. Injection practices have to be improved with reinforcing and modification of existing preventive measures. Procedures associated with higher risks of NSIs such as recapping of needles, non-wearing of gloves, improper disposal of sharps and others should be strongly discouraged so as to decrease the incidence of NSIs and morbidity and mortality associated with it...|$|R
40|$|HIV/AIDS {{awareness}} {{initiative is}} a collective responsibility {{that is not}} limited to the health sector only but to all and sundry. It could be termed 2 ̆ 2 a global crisis 2 ̆ 2 with victims all around the entire globe. Inadequate information regarding the spread of this global disease could pose a devastating effect on economic growth and social sustainability of the entire world. Therefore, creativity, synergy and collaboration from all sectors of society are required to finding solution to mitigate and curb the widespread. According to UNAIDS (2008) HIV/AIDS is among the greatest challenges to sustainable economic, social and civil society development today; it is a global crisis that undermines all aspects and all sectors of our entire society. No region of the world has been spared; the epidemic remains extremely dynamic, growing and changing characters as the virus exploits new opportunities for transmission. Hence, an effective response demands committed, urgent and sustained action by alliances of individuals, nongovernmental and governmental organizations. Furthermore, an epidemic as complex and as destructive as HIV/AIDS requires innovative and global sensitization. Literature Review Since the discovery of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the causative organism of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in 1983, the infection has attained epidemic proportion globally. HIV/AIDS is an extraordinary kind of crisis; it is both an emergency and a long-term development issue. Tumer and Unal (2000) assert that (HIV/AIDS) is one of the most complex health problems of the 21 st century. Despite increased funding, political commitments and progress in expanding access to HIV treatment, the AIDS epidemic continues to outpace every global response. Today the AIDS epidemic has become a pandemic disease that is threatening the world population. As the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to spread around the world at an alarming rate, the number of people with this disease is been expected to grow significantly by the end of this decade (ICI 2002). Moreover according to UNAIDS (2006); an estimated 24. 7 million people are living with HIV/AIDS in sub Saharan Africa. Meyer (2003) claims that HIV/AIDS which is acclaimed the fourth- leading cause of death worldwide is estimated to have claimed 25 million lives since the beginning of the epidemic. Acquired immune Deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a viral disease caused by human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that is usually found in body fluids like blood, semen, vagina fluid, and breast milk of infected persons. The virus can be transferred from one infected person to another, mostly through sexual intercourse and sharing of unsterilised instruments like blades, knives, and syringes which had once been used by infected persons. (Olaleye 2003) AIDS has rendered many children orphans, many of which were born with HIV infection. AIDS is killing the most productive people in the population, widening the level of development between developed and developing nations. It is also taking toll on the health sector since a lot of fund is channeled towards HIV/AIDS prevention and control. It has been observed that despite the many programmes organized to inform people about the problem of HIV/AIDS, the rate of it infection continues to be on the increase. (Omoniyi and Tayo-Olajubu 2006) However, Cichocki (2010) Insists that, HIV testing is the first step to take when trying to find out a person 2 ̆ 7 s status. Never should one rely on symptoms of HIV to decide whether one is infected. HIV testing is the only way to know for sure. The importance of early diagnosis of HIV cannot be overstated. Decades of HIV and AIDS researches have proven that the earlier HIV is diagnosed, the better the prognosis and the likelihood of a long and healthy life. Meanwhile, certain risk behaviors have been associated with high HIV infection rate. These behaviors according to Anochie and Eneh (2001) are either life style related or health-care provider risk. The life style related risk behaviors include multiple sexual partners, prostitution, sex with prostitute or casual partners, unprotected sex, intravenous, drug abuse and commercial blood donation among others. Moreover, various campaigns have been mounted by both governmental and non governmental association (NGOs) to curtail the spread of HIV/AIDS. Olaleye (2003) posits that these campaigns focused on measures to prevent HIV/AIDS infection. The measures include total abstainess from sex, use of condom to avoid infections from unprotected sexual intercourse, screening of blood meant for transfusion, keeping to one sexual partner, use of sterilized sharp object like <b>blades,</b> knives, <b>needles</b> / syringe, shaving and barbing instruments, Intending couples are also advised to do HIV/AIDS test before being joined in marriage. Omoniyi and Tayo-Olajubu (2006) submit that People diagnosed with AIDS may get life-threatening diseases called opportunistic infection which are caused by microbes such as viruses and bacterial that usually does not make healthy people sick. However, What the HIV does is to gradually damage the immune system so that an infected person would be vulnerable to all sorts of diseases and illnesses, which may eventually lead to the total collapse of the immune system. It is at this point a person is said to be suffering from AIDS...|$|R
