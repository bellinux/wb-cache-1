5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> terms of human physiology, which in turn might <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E
5|$|If {{one end of}} a {{wormhole}} {{was positively}} charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> this way.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Alfred J. Lotka {{proposed}} that natural selection might {{be understood as}} a physical principle that could <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> terms of the use of energy by a system, a concept later developed by Howard T. Odum as the maximum power principle in thermodynamics, whereby evolutionary systems with selective advantage maximise the rate of useful energy transformation.|$|E

5|$|A 2008 {{paper by}} food {{historian}} William Rubel and mycologist David Arora gives {{a history of}} consumption of A.muscaria as a food and describes detoxification methods. They advocate that Amanita muscaria <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> field guides as an edible mushroom, though accompanied by a description on how to detoxify it. The authors state that the widespread descriptions in field guides of this mushroom as poisonous {{is a reflection of}} cultural bias, as several other popular edible species, notably morels, are toxic unless properly cooked.|$|E
5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in physics {{is to the}} description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such systems can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions {{is to determine the}} system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E

5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} stimulated much further work. Generalizations to three dimensions—constructing a sphere tangent to four given spheres—and beyond have been studied. The {{configuration}} of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention. René Descartes gave a formula relating the radii {{of the solution}} circles and the given circles, now known as Descartes' theorem. Solving Apollonius' problem iteratively in this case leads to the Apollonian gasket, {{which is one of}} the earliest fractals to <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> print, and is important in number theory via Ford circles and the Hardy–Littlewood circle method.|$|E
5|$|Genes are {{regulated}} {{so that they}} are expressed only when the product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources. A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its internal environment (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its specific role if in a multicellular organism. Gene expression can be regulated at any step: from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, to post-translational modification of the protein. The regulation of lactose metabolism genes in E. coli (lac operon) was the first such mechanism to <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> 1961.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{reinforcement}} learning based message transfer model for transferring news report messages through a selected path in a trusted provenance network {{with the objective}} of maximizing the reward values based on trust or importance based and network congestion or utility based cost measures. The important issue of determining the integrity (trustworthiness) of data provenance in data fusion and knowledge fusion activities has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [1]. The provenance sketch of a piece of data based on files or processes that act as input data flow to the other processes has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [2]. The granularity of provenance information influencing communication and processing overhead has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [2]. A networked provenance system with migration of information between network nodes has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [3, 4]. The use of concepts of provenance applied to news reports analysis has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [5 – 9]. The application of markov decision process to planning, event modelling has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [10, 11]. The model for a message passing network has been considered in [12]. A description of the rationale for storage and retrieval of trusted information using a probabilistic temporal database approach has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [12].|$|R

5|$|The {{behavior}} of certain other systems, such as one-dimensional cyclic cellular automata, can also <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> terms of ballistic annihilation. There is a technical restriction on the particle positions for the ballistic annihilation view of Rule 184 {{that does not}} arise in these other systems, stemming from the alternating pattern of the background: in the particle system corresponding to a Rule 184 state, if two consecutive particles are both of the same type they must be an odd number of cells apart, while if they are of opposite types they must be an even number of cells apart. However this parity restriction does not {{play a role in}} the statistical {{behavior of}} this system.|$|E
5|$|The {{matching}} rules can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> several ways. One {{approach is to}} color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another {{is to use a}} pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E
5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E

5|$|Megalosaurus {{may have}} been the first dinosaur, apart from modern birds, to <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> the {{scientific}} literature. Part of a bone was recovered from the Taynton Limestone Formation of Stonesfield limestone quarry, Oxfordshire in 1676. Sir Thomas Pennyson gave the fragment to Robert Plot, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford and first curator of the Ashmolean Museum, who published a description and illustration in his Natural History of Oxfordshire in 1676. It was the first illustration of a dinosaur bone published. Plot correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the thighbone or femur of a large animal and he recognized that it was too large to belong to any species known to be living in England. He therefore at first concluded it to be the thighbone of a Roman war elephant and later that of a giant human, such as those mentioned in the Bible. The bone has since been lost, but the illustration is detailed enough that some have since identified it as that of Megalosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} {{of the concept of}} a Hilbert space was underlined with the realization that it offers one of the best mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics. In short, the states of a quantum mechanical system are vectors in a certain Hilbert space, the observables are hermitian operators on that space, the symmetries of the system are unitary operators, and measurements are orthogonal projections. The relation between quantum mechanical symmetries and unitary operators provided an impetus {{for the development of the}} unitary representation theory of groups, initiated in the 1928 work of Hermann Weyl. On the other hand, in the early 1930s it became clear that classical mechanics can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> terms of Hilbert space (Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics) and that certain properties of classical dynamical systems can be analyzed using Hilbert space techniques in the framework of ergodic theory.|$|E
