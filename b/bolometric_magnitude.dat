In the J, H and K bands the fitted PL relations for the O Miras are found to have smaller dispersion than those for the C Miras, at both mean and maximum light, while the converse is true for the relations based on <b>bolometric</b> <b>magnitudes.</b> The reduction in dispersion between mean and maximum light is generally found to be more significant in the J, H and bolometric bands than in the K band – in which the mean PL relations display the smallest dispersion.
