40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} design of a CMOS 900 -MHz <b>bandpass</b> <b>amplifier</b> that is suitable for RF transceivers. The work employs the state-of-art inductive degeneration techniques to minimize the noise figure and explores the use of lossy spiral inductors in high frequency circuit to realize input matching networks on-chip. A Q-compensation circuit is included to achieve a 25 -MHz 3 -dB bandwidth. Besides, a center frequency tuning circuit is also embedded to compensate for frequency deviations due to process variations. In the first prototype, a second-order <b>bandpass</b> <b>amplifier</b> had been fabricated in standard 0. 8 μm single-poly, triple-metal CMOS process (HP SCN 26 G) provided by MOSIS™. With a 3 -V supply, at 950 -MHz and a 3 -dB bandwidth of 25 -MHz, the measured voltage gain is 26 dB and the input S 11 is - 13 dB. Under the same baising condition, the input third-order intermodulation product (IIP 3) and input-referred 1 -dB compression point (P 0, 1 -dB) are - 21. 5 dBm and - 3 1. 5 dBm respectively. The image rejection at 140 -MHz away from the desired signal is 20 dB. In addition, the Q of the amplifier can be tuned from around 2 to infinity and the center frequency can also be varied from 930 MHz to 1040 MHz. On the grounds that the measured on-chip spiral's quality factor is merely around 2 (compared to around 3 to 5 in recent literatures), the measured noise figure of the whole amplifier is around 10 dB. The power dissipation and the die area of the first prototype are 90 mW and 1. 2 mm x 0. 8 mm respectively. So as to enhance the image rejection ability and to reduce the power consumption, a sixth-order <b>bandpass</b> <b>amplifier</b> had been implemented and fabricated in standard 0. 5 μm CMOS process using 2 -V supply. In this second prototype, a <b>bandpass</b> <b>amplifier</b> was cascaded with two identical second-order bandpass filters to realize the sixth-order bandpass response. For the <b>bandpass</b> <b>amplifier</b> in the second prototype, the measured voltage gain is 26 dB at 832 MHz and a S 11 of - 14 dB. With an overall 3 -dB bandwidth of 25 MHz, the measured IIP 3 and the 1 -dB compression point of the <b>bandpass</b> <b>amplifier</b> are - 18. 5 dBm and - 29 dBm respectively. Besides, the center frequency can be varied between 760 MHz and 832 MHz. The measured noise figure is 9. 6 dB, which is much higher than the simulation due to inadequate modeling of the thermal noise in short-channel MOSFETs and the use of low-quality inductors. Meanwhile, the performance of the three-stage design in the second prototype was tested, the measured center frequency of the design is located at 830 MHz with a gain of 16 dB. The corresponding 3 -dB bandwidth is 25 MHz and the image rejection at 140 MHz away from the desired signal is around 45 dB. In addition, the input third-order intermodulation product (IIP 3) and the input-referred 1 -dB compression point are - 15 dBm and - 26 dBm respectively.

However, these are bulky and are typically {{located in a}} medical facility where patient monitoring is costly and quite inefficient. Home-based portable systems solve these problems to an extent but they record only a minimal number of channels due to limited battery life. To surmount this, wearable sleep system are desired which need to be unobtrusive and have long battery life. In this thesis, a novel sleep system architecture is presented that enables the design of an ultra low power sleep diagnostic system. This architecture is capable of extending the recording time to 120 hours in a wearable system which is {{an order of magnitude}} improvement over commercial wearable systems that record for about 12 hours. This architecture has in effect reduced the average power consumption of 5 - 6 mW per channel to less than 500 uW per channel. This has been achieved by eliminating sampled data architecture, reducing the wireless transmission rate and by moving the sleep scoring to the sensors. Further, ultra low power instrumentation amplifiers have been designed to operate in weak inversion region to support this architecture.

40|$|UnrestrictedTwo micro-power, low-noise, <b>bandpass</b> sense <b>amplifiers</b> for {{biomedical}} implants are presented. Operating at low frequency, both amplifiers {{are fully}} integrated without any external passive components. Low-frequency noise and offset are reduced through autozeroing technique. Autozeroing requency and noise bandwidth are optimized to reduce noise folding. Subthreshold operation is utilized in all input pair transistors to reduce power consumption and increase trans-conductance efficiency. The impact of mismatch from transistors in weak inversion are measured {{and the proposed}} amplifiers are proved to function correctly against these mismatch issues. The first generation sense amplifier consists of a variable gain amplifier as the first stage, a low-Gm high-pass filter as the second stage, and a low-pass Gm-C amplifier as the last stage. The low-Gm OTA (Operational Trans-conductance Amplifier) is realized with a current division technique. A cross-couple parallel pair of source degeneration transistors is utilized to increase the linearity crucial to neural spike detection. The design is realized in TSMC 0. 18 um CMOS process. It achieved 600 uV input offset, a variable gain from 42 dB to 0 dB, and 50 to 900 Hz bandwidth while occupying 0. 245 mm^ 2 area. The total circuit consumes 26 uW in a 1. 8 V power supply; the input referred noise {{is estimated to be}} 5. 6 uVrms. A power-adaptive, <b>bandpass</b> second generation <b>amplifier</b> is reported as the improved design. The amplifier consists of a novel variable gain amplifier, and a 2 nd order Gm-C filter by cascading two identical low-Gm high-pass filter and low-pass Gm-C amplifier combo. A class AB buffer is added to save static power while boost the maximum driving currents to data converter's 13 pF input capacitance. Local autozeroing technique is applied to reduce low-frequency noise and offset. Amplified signals after the filters are sensed to control the tail current in the first stage gain amplifier.; Noise and power tradeoff analysis of a typical OTA shows tail current can be utilized as the design variable. Therefore, a proposed power-adaptive sense amplifier reduces power consumption when no neural signal is present and increases power consumption to reduce input referred noise when neural signals exist. The fully integrated design measured 68 dB to 0 dB gain, 600 to 3 kHz bandwidth, and occupied 0. 21 mm^ 2 area in IBM 0. 18 um CMOS process. The amplifier under 1. 8 V power supply consumes 16 uW when no neural signals exist and consumes 20 uW when neural signals are present. The measured integrated input referred noise is 7 uVrms within the band of interest. These sense amplifiers are also the first neural amplifiers implemented in 0. 18 um CMOS process. This research demonstrates the superiority of open-loop autozeroing over chopping technique in power consumption performance.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{quadrature}} modeling {{structure is}} widely accepted as an efficient {{tool for the}} nonlinear simulation of RF/microwave <b>bandpass</b> stages (power <b>amplifiers,</b> etc.) for wireless applications. The common belief is that this structure {{can be applied to}} model only bandpass memoryless nonlinearities (which, however, may exhibit amplitude-to-phase conversion). In two recent articles [1, 2] the authors have extended the application of the quadrature modeling structure to modeling broadband nonlinearities, which makes possible to predict harmonics and even-order nonlinearities, {{to take into account the}} frequency response, etc. This article completes the overview of the instantaneous quadrature technique. The authors discuss its application to modeling AM, FM and PM detectors, which are strongly nonlinear elements with large memory (both the strong nonlinearity and large memory effects are essential for the detector proper operation), thus removing the limitation of nonlinearity to be memoryless or quasimemoryless. The identification of nonlinear interference/distortion sources is of great relevance for a practical EMC/EMI design. In the second part of this article, we discuss the dichotomous identification method, which is much more computationally efficient than a simple single-signal method, especially for a large number of input signals. Individual spectral components of a complex-spectrum signal can also be considered as input signals and, hence, it is possible to identify the spectral components responsible for a particular nonlinear interference/distortion (say, for a particula...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Over {{the past}} decade, {{opportunities}} for utilizing the broadband spectrum available at millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies has motivated research on both short and long-range, highly-integrated complementary {{metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) transceivers. Prototype mm-wave CMOS transceivers have been demonstrated for application in high-speed data transfer (57 - 64 GHz), wireless back-haul (71 - 76 GHz), automotive radar (77 GHz) and medical imaging (90 GHz) systems. However, in spite of promising results, large scale deployment of mm-wave CMOS transceivers in portable and hand-held electronics is currently hindered by front-end power-consumptions on the order of several watts. Moreover, as a first order approximation, power consumption is directly proportional to system bandwidth. Therefore, as the bandwidth requirements of systems increase, the challenge with on-chip power consumption will become increasingly difficult to solve. In this dissertation, techniques for optimizing the power and area of ultra-wideband millimeter-wave transceivers are described. This work resulted in the fabrication of three mm-wave integrated circuits (IC), all of which were realized in a 6 -metal layer 40 -nm CMOS process. The first IC is a multi-stage transformer-feedback based 11 -to- 13 GHz direct-conversion receiver. The device achieves a 16 % fractional-bandwidth, a peak power-gain of 27. 6 dB, and noise-figure of 5. 3 dB while consuming 28. 8 mW from a 0. 9 V supply. Second, a compact 24 - 54 GHz 2 -stage <b>bandpass</b> distributed <b>amplifier</b> utilizing mirror-symmetric Norton transformations to reduce inductor component values allowing efficient layout to occupy an active area of 0. 15 mm 2. The device has a 77 % fractional-bandwidth, an overall gain of 6. 3 dB, a minimum in-band IIP 3 of 11 dBm, while consuming 34 mA from a 1 V supply. The third, and the IC which includes the most integration among the three, is an ultra-broadband single-element heterodyne receiver intended for use in low-power phased-array systems. The receiver maintains 17 GHz of bandwidth from the mm-wave front end, through a high-IF stage, and to the baseband output. The device occupies 1. 2 mm 2 and exploits properties of gain-equalized transformers throughout the signal path to achieve an overall 17 GHz bandwidth 20 dB gain with a flat in-band response, 7. 8 dB DSB NF, and a P - 1 dB of - 24 dBm, while consuming 104 mW off a 1. 1 V supply...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Electrical {{activity}} in the brain spans {{a wide range of}} spatial and temporal scales, requiring simultaneous recording of multiple modalities of neurophysiological signals in order to capture various aspects of brain state dynamics. Here, we present a 16 -channel neural interface integrated circuit fabricated in a 0. 5 m 3 M 2 P CMOS process for selective digital acquisition of biopotentials across the spectrum of neural signal modalities in the brain, ranging from single spike action potentials to local field potentials (LFP), electrocorticograms (ECoG), and electroencephalograms (EEG). Each channel is composed of a tunable bandwidth, fixed gain front-end amplifier and a programmable gain/resolution continuous-time incremental 16 analog-to-digital converter (ADC). A two-stage topology for the front-end voltage amplifier with capacitive feedback offers independent tuning of the <b>amplifier</b> <b>bandpass</b> frequency corners, and attains a noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 2. 9 at 8. 2 kHz bandwidth for spike recording, and a NEF of 3. 2 at 140 Hz bandwidth for EEG recording. The amplifier has a measured midband gain of 39. 6 dB, frequency response from 0. 2 Hz to 8. 2 kHz, and an input-referred noise of 1. 94 rms while drawing 12. 2 A of current from a 3. 3 V supply. The lower and higher cutoff frequencies of the bandpass filter are adjustable from 0. 2 to 94 Hz and 140 Hz to 8. 2 kHz, respectively. At 10 -bit resolution, the ADC has an SNDR of 56 dB while consuming 76 W power. Time-modulation feedback in the ADC offers programmable digital gain (1 - 4096) for auto-ranging, further improving the dynamic range and linearity of the ADC. Experimental recordings with the system show spike signals in rat somatosensory cortex as well as alpha EEG {{activity in}} a human subject.

40|$|The CoNNeCT Global Positioning System RF Module (GPSM) slice {{is part of}} the JPL CoNNeCT Software Defined Radio (SDR). CoNNeCT is the Communications, Navigation, and Net working {{reconfigurable}} Testbed {{project that}} is part of NASA's Space Communication and Nav igation (SCaN) Program. The CoNNeCT project is an experimental dem onstration that will lead to the advancement of SDRs and provide a path for new space communication and navigation systems for future NASA exploration missions. The JPL CoNNeCT SDR will be flying on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2012 in support of the SCaN CoNNeCT program. The GPSM is a radio-frequency sampler module (see Figure 1) that directly sub-harmonically samples the filtered GPS L-band signals at L 1 (1575. 42 MHz), L 2 (1227. 6 MHz), and L 5 (1176. 45 MHz). The JPL SDR receives GPS signals through a Dorne & Margolin antenna mounted onto a choke ring. The GPS signal is filtered against interference, amplified, split, and fed into three channels: L 1, L 2, and L 5. In each of the L-band channels, there is a chain of <b>bandpass</b> filters and <b>amplifiers,</b> and the signal is fed through each of these channels to where the GPSM performs a one-bit analog-to-digital conversion (see Figure 2). The GPSM uses a sub-harmonic, single-bit L 1, L 2, and L 5 sampler that samples at a clock rate of 38. 656 MHz. The new capability is the down-conversion and sampling of the L 5 signal when previous hardware did not provide this capability. The first GPS IIF Satellite was launched in 2010, providing the new L 5 signal. With the JPL SDR flying on the ISS, {{it will be possible to}} demonstrate navigation solutions with 10 -meter 3 -D accuracy at 10 -second intervals using a field-program mable gate array (FPGA) -based feedback loop running at 50 Hz. The GPS data bits will be decoded and used in the SDR. The GPSM will also allow other waveforms that are installed in the SDR to demonstrate various GNSS tracking techniques...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} various aspects of periodically amplified nonlinear systems, in which solitons play a central role. A new nonlinear oscillator is introduced. The Baseband Soliton Oscillator (BSO) is fashioned from a loop of nonlinear transmission line. The oscillator supports an endlessly circulating Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) soliton - and more generally, exhibits the periodic cnoidal and double cnoidal solutions. Frequency dependent losses are shown {{to be responsible for}} the stability of the BSO. The double cnoidal oscillation allows subtle aspects of soliton-soliton interaction to be identified. A novel nonlinear partial differential equation is derived to capture the dynamics of the BSO. Uniform and viscous losses are added to the KdV equation, while a periodic inhomogeneity models the amplification. The steady states of this equation are sought numerically and found to agree with the experimental results. A new technique based on the Method of Multiple Scales is advanced to derive average equations for periodically amplified systems described by either the lossy KdV or Nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. The method proceeds by explicitly considering the nonlinear and dispersive effects as perturbations between amplifiers. Although the concept of an average NLS equation is well known, the average KdV equation is novel. The result is verified numerically. Including the effects of frequency dependent losses in the average KdV description yields an accurate steady state analysis of the BSO. An envelope soliton analogue of the BSO is advanced. The Envelope Soliton Oscillator (ESO) endlessly circulates an envelope soliton. The device is a close electronic analogue of the Soliton Fibre Ring Laser, in that it includes an <b>amplifier,</b> <b>bandpass</b> filter, nonlinear transmission line and saturable absorber. It is shown that the saturable absorber promotes the formation of solitons in the ESO. Studies of the perturbed average KdV equation reveal the asymptotic widths of average KdV solitons can be found via a direct method. The steady state is found by equating the gain to the dissipation, assuming a constant pulse shape between amplifiers. It is shown that this analysis is also applicable to periodically amplified NLS systems, and thus to optical soliton communication links...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Floating-gate {{technology can be}} used to build silicon systems that adapt and learn. This technology is well suited to implement adaptation and learning because we are not building analog EEPROMS, but rather circuit elements with important time domain dynamics. These floating-gate circuits use the hot-electron-injection, electron-tunneling, and drain-induced-barrier-lowering phenomena in a standard submicron CMOS process. This technology works with the constraints of the silicon medium, and is similar to biological systems that turned potential liabilities into features. I develop the first analytical model of the impact-ionization and hot-electron processes in MOS devices by solving for a self-consistent distribution function from the spatially varying Boltzmann transport equation. From this electron distribution function, the probabilities of impact ionization and hot-electron injection are calculated as functions of channel current, drain voltage, and floating-gate voltage. The analytical model simultaneously fits both the hot-electron-injection and impact-ionization data. These analytical results yield measurements of the energy-dependent impactionization collision rate that is consistent with numerically calculated collision rates reported in the literature. I describe the design, fabrication, characterization, and modeling of an array of single-transistor synapses that simultaneously store the weight value, compute the product of the input and floating gate value, and update the weight value according to a hebbian or backpropagation learning rule. Circuits with one floating-gate synapse exhibit a range of possible stabilizing and destabilizing behaviors, and circuits with multiple-synapses show examples of competitive and cooperative behavior. By providing feedback to the source, we get a [ [...] . ]FET synapse where voltage changes in both the floating gate and drain stabilize the floating gate. I present a <b>bandpass</b> floating gate <b>amplifier</b> that uses tunneling and [ [...] . ]FET hot-electron injection to adaptively set its DC operating point. Because the gate currents are small, the circuit exhibits a high-pass characteristic with a cutoff frequency less than 1 Hz. The high frequency cutoff is controlled electronically, as is done in continuous-time filters. I have derived analytical models that completely characterize the amplifier and that are in good agreement with experimental data {{for a wide range of}} operating conditions and input waveforms. This autozeroing floating-gate amplifier demonstrates how to use continuous-time, floating-gate adaptation...|$|R
