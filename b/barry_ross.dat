The media had wanted City and NSW state of residence games Five-eighth Robert Laurie in the test team instead of Lewis who they felt was only selected to give the Queensland Rugby League a player in the team.

50|$|NSW had {{originally}} selected South Sydney's Michael Pattison to play , but had fallen ill before the team left Sydney {{and the flight}} at altitude had caused a middle-ear infection that forced him to withdraw.

This was against the wishes of coach Ted Glossop who wanted to move Steve Rogers to the halves, Phil Sigsworth to the centres, bring in Garry Dowling as fullback and play Lamb from the bench. The team actually trained in those positions {{on the morning of the}} game before Lamb arrived and according to Glossop, Rogers trained very well at pivot and combined well with Qld born Peter Sterling who was making his Origin debut for the Blues. Glossop later recounted that he was told of Lamb's selection immediately after training and even then thought of going his own way until told the NSWRL insisted that Lamb play 5/8 and Rogers was not play anywhere but in the centres.|$|E

Some of the {{key players in the}} early heart transplant operations in the UK gathered to consider the events of 1968, when the first transplants took place and their immediate and long-term implications. Not only were surgical advances reviewed, but also the professional, social and legal disquiet at what, {{by the end of the}} 20 thC, has become a widely accepted and almost routine operation for many cardiovascular surgeons. Cardiac surgeons attending include: Professor Tom Treasure (Chair), Sir Terence English, Professor Donald Longmore, Mr <b>Barry</b> <b>Ross,</b> Mr Donald Ross, Sir Keith Ross, and Mr John Wallwork.

Despite their position, they still believe in a final victory. Captain Sisko (Avery Brooks) anticipates this, however, and he and Chancellor Martok (J. G.

40|$|JP (tort) 89 Fig. 6. R 1 vs. p'/ 2 {{according}} to Eq. [5] {{the dependence of}} the parabolic rate. As shown in Fig. 6, the l inear reaction rate {{is proportional to the}} square root of the partial pressure of water vapor. Assuming a rate expression of the form R 1 = kiP 1 / 2 [6] rate constants were calculated from the lines in Fig. 6. The Arrhenius plot shown in Fig. 5 yielded a value of 38. 4 kcal/mole for the apparent activation energy. The interpretation of the l inear reaction period is uncertain. It could correspond to rate control by a surface reaction process of the type given in Eq. [1] and [2], i. e., reaction at the surface to form substituted oxygen and anion vacancies. If such were the case, Eq. [2] indicates that the concentration of dissolved oxygen would be proportional to the square root of the partial pressure of water vapor. An enthalpy of 38 kcal/mole that was obtained by Mollwo for the formation of F centers in CaF 2 was quoted by Bon-tinck (1).

They evaluate the plans and decide to move against the Chin'toka star system. Meanwhile Lt Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn) and Lt Cmdr. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) discuss their plans to have a baby with Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig). Both Bashir and Quark (Armin Shimerman) mourn the fact that it means that Worf and Dax's marriage is solid and neither have a chance with her. They both visit the holosuite to see Vic Fontaine (James Darren) who counsels them on their loss. Sisko meets with General Martok (J. G.

The night before the attack, Sisko receives a vision from the prophets, who warn him not to leave the station. Sisko tells Ross about the vision, who responds that he must decide between his duty to Starfleet and the prophets.|$|R

Larry Estrin, the Super Bowl engineer, told USA Today that TV viewers actually heard the studio version, [...] "plus her live voice, plus the audience reaction," [...] and added that [...] "She sang the melody and words the same way (as the studio version), but she sang her heart out."

Some people have speculated that Houston lip-synced the National Anthem at the game." [...] On February 4, 1991, Mary Jo Melone of the same newspaper, in her article of Houston's Super Bowl performance, clearly stated that [...] "It was the Memorex. The singing and music you heard were prerecorded." [...] Bob Best, an NFL pre-game entertainment official told USA Today that the NFL chose the recorded version because [...] "we felt there were too many risks to do it live." [...] USA Today reported that it is customary to use pre-recorded versions of the anthem at games, adding that in the past such stars as Diana <b>Ross,</b> <b>Barry</b> Manilow and Neil Diamond have sung to their pre-recorded versions of [...] "The Star Spangled Banner." [...] Best, {{in an interview with the}} New York Post, also said that what was played was [...] "protection copy"―it's so-called to protect against the singer's last minute inability to sing―Houston recorded several days before the game at an L.A. studio. Kathryn Holm McManus, former executive director of the orchestra, in an interview with St. Petersburg Times in 2001, reaffirmed that, saying [...] "At the game, everyone was playing, and Whitney was singing, but there were no live microphones. Everyone was lip-synching or finger-synching." ...|$|R
