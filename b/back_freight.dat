Riding his horse on the trail north, up to Tucson, near Tubac he was attacked by a band of Apache Indian raiders. They scalped him, stabbed him, shot him repeatedly, took his guns, took his horse, took his clothes, and tied him naked to a large saguaro cactus along the Nogales to Tucson wagon trail, to die. By morning the southbound stagecoach going from Tucson down to Nogales came upon the gruesome sight of the barely recognizable dead man.

5000|$|When {{incumbent}} State Representative Nick Thompson {{opted to}} run for a position as a Circuit Judge on the 20th Judicial Circuit of Florida rather than seek re-election, Caldwell ran to succeed him in the 73rd District, based in northern Lee County, including Fort Myers and stretching from Suncoast Estates to Gateway. He faced Jason Moon, John Schultz, and Deanna Casalino in the Republican primary. Caldwell was able to narrowly defeat his opponents to win his party's nomination, receiving 35% of the vote to Moon's 29%, Schultz's 27%, and Casalino's 8%, and he advanced to the general election, where he was opposed by Democratic nominee Cole Peacock and Tea Party candidate Pantoja Rodriguez in the general election. During the campaign, Caldwell campaigned on improving the region's economy by [...] "bringing <b>back</b> <b>freight</b> rail service" [...] so that the industrial base of the region can grow. [...] "We've got freight rail lines running through the county, {{but they are very}} under-utilized. The fact is that there are other areas of the state that have been very successful with this and as a result have a lower unemployment rate." [...] Despite the fact that the Marco Island Sun Times endorsed Peacock, they praised Caldwell for having a [...] "valuable" [...] perspective and a respectable [...] "record of local service." [...] In the end, Caldwell defeated both of his opponents, winning 59% of the vote to Peacock's 38% and Rodriguez's 3%.|$|E

40|$|This book {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} role of shipbuilding in the large shipping world. A large amount of studies on shipping markets are based on the efficient market theory. However, given the unpredictable and ever-changing nature of shipping industry, it is not convincing to study the market statically. This book looks into the dynamics between freight and shipbuilding markets in a more delicate way: the interaction among freight rate, shipbuilding order and delivery. It focuses specifically on the factor of 'time lag' between different shipping segments through a comprehensive econometric analysis. Shipbuilding variables do not interact with other economic variables in a static way, the dynamics among freight rate, shipbuilding order and delivery act in a cyclical manner. While the shipbuilding market largely depends on the operating environment of other shipping markets, it influences <b>back</b> <b>freight</b> market profoundly...|$|E

Though it was unclear how much time the expedition would take, Klevan had initially estimated a loss of 10%; the end result was approximately 11%. A French representative of the company met the crew in Libreville. A personal friend of President Charles de Gaulle, he presented an offer to drive the ice back to Paris. If the crew accepted, the President himself would have received the crew under the Arc de Triomphe. The men, however, were too exhausted at that point to contemplate such an offer. Instead, arrangement were made for the vehicles to be brought <b>back</b> by <b>freight,</b> while the crew would fly home. The ice was cut up and divided between the citizens of Libreville, for whom this was a rare commodity.

It was the site of the San Pedro Station of the Butterfield Overland Mail and a wagon depot, the San Pedro River Station, run since 1871 by William Ohnesorgen. In 1878 he had erected a toll bridge over which mining supplies were transported to the new mining camps such as Fairbank and Tombstone.

40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Rail {{transport}} {{refers to}} the transportation of various commodities, goods and services traded as cargo and freight within South Africa and out of South Africa for export to the other Southern African communities (SADC region), the rest of Africa and other continents of the world. It also {{refers to the}} imports into South Africa from the regions mentioned. Competitiveness relates to a country or company’s available resources and supporting policies and regulations in place which allow them to compete and do business locally, internationally and globally while improving the country’s economy and the company’s profitability. There are different criteria {{that can be used}} to determine the level of competitiveness, depending on each company or country’s capabilities. In the past years, the progress and development of the South African rail industry has been neglected and this has resulted in the rail transportation not being used. Railway line maintenance has become a challenge and service delivery is below customer expectations. Road transport has better availability and reliability, which has led companies to prefer road transport for freight. The main objective of this study is to reach a detailed understanding of the views of freight rail transport consumers and the impact of rail transport on the economic competitiveness of South Africa. Another important objective is to present the study in a format that is easily understandable. The approach adopted for this study is quantitative and uses a survey research questionnaire which was distributed to freight rail transport customers and providers. The data collected from the questionnaire was submitted to a statistical consultant service at North-West University. The statistical consultant analysed the data using the SPSS statistics computer programme to arrive at the results presented in this study. The overall findings from this study are that companies that use roads to transport freight do so because of the unavailability and unreliability of the freight rail transport provider Transnet Freight Rail and that these companies opt for road transport because they use a ‘just in time’ (JIT) system whereby a small quantity of stock is transported continuously which Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) does not accommodate. These factors have resulted in TFR’s poor service delivery. Therefore, a market demand strategy has been initiated by TFR to improve the performance of the company. It is important to note here that freight rail transport should concentrate on improving service delivery and not only on increasing capacity. The research participants indicated that the TFR objective to move <b>freight</b> <b>back</b> to rail could be accomplished. This will lessen the burden and damage to South African roads and reduce traffic congestion and accidents caused by trucks on the roads. It will also increase employment opportunities and the country’s economic competitiveness while reducing transport costs. All these aspects will make a significant impact on the economy of the country. Master...|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) Transport plays {{a pivotal}} role within the South African economy as it enables the country to achieve {{economic}} growth. The transport industry does not only facilitate the movement of freight and people, it also employs {{a great number of}} individuals and forms a major part of South Africa‟s GDP. The 8 th Annual State of Logistics Survey for South Africa indicated that transport costs were accountable for 6. 8 per cent of the country‟s GDP in 2010. The importance of the transport industry necessitates that the industry is operated efficiently and effectively. Transport mode choices are not only made based on transportation costs but various other factors are affecting how companies choose the mode of transport for their freight movement requirements. Other factors that are considered include transit time, reliability, accessibility, capability and security/safety. Opportunity costs should also be considered when choosing a mode of transport. There are various different types of opportunity costs that exist within the supply chain, these include the opportunity cost associated with poor service levels, the opportunity cost of returning a vehicle without a backhaul, opportunity costs due to delays, the opportunity cost of holding inventory and lost sales opportunity costs. As transportation costs are not the only factor that companies consider when making a modal choice decision, many companies within South Africa have been moving their goods off rail and onto road. This study highlights the importance of determining the impact that an inefficient mode of transport has on a company‟s transportation model and costs. The main focus {{of this study is to}} determine the logistics opportunity cost of using road transport within a mining company. A case study approach is followed as the study aims to present a complex problem experienced by one company to be analysed and presented in an easily understandable format. All the data and company information used within this study was supplied by company DKVL. Data was collected through unstructured personal interviews and specific questions were developed for each person interviewed. The data was triangulated and verified through the use of company DKVL‟s financial statements. From the results of this study, the logistics opportunity cost associated with the mode of transport is substantial. This necessitates the need for companies to revise their transport mode choice on a regular basis as it has a major impact not only on their transportation costs, but also on their inventory holding and carbon emissions. Based on the findings of this study, Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) should not only focus on expanding its existing capacity, it should also focus on improving its customer service delivery. By providing poor service delivery, companies will not shift their <b>freight</b> <b>back</b> onto rail and will rather choose to use road transport to receive the benefit of reliability and flexibility, even if it is a more expensive mode of transport. The knock-on effect of companies choosing to use road transport as opposed to rail transport is significant. The quality of South African roads will continue to deteriorate, companies will continue to pay more to maintain and repair their vehicles and the transport industry will continue to increasingly damage the environment through increased carbon emissions. The impact of not having reliable rail transport is increased logistics costs which have a significant impact on the South African economy...|$|R
