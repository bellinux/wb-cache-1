5|$|In June 1849 the {{governor}} of Sohar made a treaty with the British resident to suppress the slave trade. This triggered a revolt by the religious party in which {{the governor}} was killed and his father, Hamad, was made governor. The Sultan of Oman, then residing in Zanzibar, arranged for Hamad to <b>be</b> <b>seized</b> and thrown in jail in Fort al Jalali. Hamad died on 23 April 1850, either from starvation or from poison.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrayal}} of nudes was officially discouraged in 17th-century Spain. Works could <b>be</b> <b>seized</b> or repainting {{demanded by the}} Inquisition, and artists who painted licentious or immoral works were often excommunicated, fined, or banished from Spain for a year. However, within intellectual and aristocratic circles, the aims of art were believed to supersede questions of morality, and there were many, generally mythological, nudes in private collections.|$|E

5|$|The scuttling of the German fleet {{took place}} at the Royal Navy's base at Scapa Flow, in Scotland, after the First World War. The High Seas Fleet was interned there {{under the terms of the}} Armistice whilst {{negotiations}} took place over the fate of the ships. Fearing that all of the ships would <b>be</b> <b>seized</b> and divided amongst the allied powers, the German commander, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, decided to scuttle the fleet.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{federal investigation}} into the incident found that the error coins had been struck accidentally, but two former Mint employees were guilty of selling some of the dollars, resulting in imprisonment and fines for both individuals. In 2002, Mint officials announced {{that two of the}} ten coins then reported had entered circulation through legal channels, but the other eight were of dubious origins and might <b>be</b> <b>seized.</b> However, as of 2011, the federal government has not attempted to seize the eight examples considered of dubious origin.|$|E
5|$|Cannibal Holocaust {{achieved}} notoriety as its graphic violence aroused a {{great deal}} of controversy. After its premiere in Italy, it was ordered to <b>be</b> <b>seized</b> by a local magistrate, and Deodato was arrested on obscenity charges. He was later charged with making a snuff film due to rumors that claimed some actors were killed on camera. Although Deodato was later cleared, the film was banned in Italy, Australia, and several other countries due to its portrayal of graphic brutality, sexual assault, and real depictions of violence toward animals. Some nations have since revoked the ban, though it is still upheld in several countries. Critics have suggested that the film is a commentary about civilized versus uncivilized society.|$|E
50|$|Cash has <b>been</b> <b>seized</b> in {{peculiar}} circumstances. For example, New York businessman James Lieto's $392,000 in cash <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> {{by federal}} authorities, since his legitimate funds {{mixed up with}} illegal funds in an armored car which <b>was</b> <b>seized</b> by an FBI probe.

5|$|Cape {{announced}} that he had stopped publication, but he secretly leased the rights to Pegasus Press, an English-language publisher in France. His partner Wren Howard took papier-mâché moulds of the type to Paris, and by 28 September, Pegasus Press was shipping its edition to the London bookseller Leopold Hill, who acted as distributor. With publicity increasing demand, sales were brisk, but the reappearance of The Well on bookshop shelves soon {{came to the attention of}} the Home Office. On 3 October Joynson-Hicks issued a warrant for shipments of the book to <b>be</b> <b>seized.</b>|$|E
5|$|Moltke was {{surrendered}} {{with the}} rest of the High Seas Fleet on 24 November 1918 and interned at Scapa Flow, under the command of Kapitänleutnant Wollante. Believing that the Treaty of Versailles had been signed and his fleet was about to <b>be</b> <b>seized</b> by the British, Rear Admiral von Reuter ordered the scuttling of the High Seas Fleet on 21 June 1919, while the British Grand Fleet was away on exercises. The ship sank in two hours and fifteen minutes. Moltke was raised in 1927 and scrapped at Rosyth in 1929.|$|E
5|$|One proof Bicentennial coin {{in silver}} clad and lacking a mint mark, {{similar to the}} dollar in the {{prototype}} set given to President Ford, is known. This piece supposedly came from a cash register drawer at the Woodward & Lothrop department store in Washington, D.C. Thomas K. DeLorey, who was then a reporter for Coin World, spoke to the discoverer and was suspicious of the story, thinking it more likely the coin was surreptitiously obtained from the government. He declined to question the origin then, fearing it might <b>be</b> <b>seized</b> and lost to the numismatic community. The piece brought almost $30,000 by private sale in 1987.|$|E

5|$|The {{legality}} of the bat'leth in the United States differs between states. In 2009, a replica bat'leth was used in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in two armed robberies. The Colorado Springs Police Department {{said that it was}} a deadly weapon.

5|$|The {{military}} crusading {{order of}} the Knights Templar also held extensive property in England, bringing in around £2,200 per annum {{by the time of}} their fall. It comprised primarily rural holdings rented out for cash, but also included some urban properties in London. Following the dissolution of the Templar order in France by Philip IV of France, Edward II ordered their properties to <b>be</b> <b>seized</b> and passed to the Hospitaller order in 1313, but in practice many properties were taken by local landowners and the Hospital was still attempting to reclaim them twenty-five years later.|$|E
5|$|The rising {{forced a}} change of policy by the regime, which instead of {{attempting}} to replace the landholding classes now looked for a reconciliation with former Royalists and Engagers. This resulted in the Act of Grace and Pardon, proclaimed in Edinburgh on 5 May 1654. Instead of a blanket forfeiture among those implicated in resistance, it named 24 persons (mainly from the nobility) whose lands would <b>be</b> <b>seized,</b> and 73 other landholders who could retain their estates after paying a fine. Even then most of those names were treated with leniency and fines were remitted for confiscations, or were reduced, and some were abandoned.|$|E

5|$|A partial {{evacuation}} of British citizens {{was completed by}} 17 January, when the army riots in Southeast Africa prompted Rhyls diversion to Tanganyika so the troops she was carrying could assist in quelling the mutiny. In replacement, a company of the Gordon Highlanders was loaded aboard Owen so an intervention could still be made if necessary. The aircraft carriers Centaur and Victorious were also transferred to the region as part of Operation Parthenon. Although never enacted, Parthenon {{was intended as a}} precaution should Okello or the Umma party radicals attempt to seize power from the more moderate ASP. In addition to the two carriers, the plan involved three destroyers, Owen, 13 helicopters, 21 transport and reconnaissance aircraft, the second battalion of the Scots Guards, 45 Commando of the Royal Marines and one company of the second battalion of the Parachute Regiment. The island of Unguja, and its airport, were to <b>be</b> <b>seized</b> by parachute and helicopter assault, followed up by the occupation of Pemba. Parthenon would have been the largest British airborne and amphibious operation since the Suez Crisis.|$|E
5|$|Affairs quieted {{after the}} initial persecution. Diocletian {{remained}} in Antioch for the following three years. He visited Egypt once, over the winter of 301302, where he began the grain dole in Alexandria. In Egypt, some Manicheans, followers of the prophet Mani, were denounced {{in the presence of}} the proconsul of Africa. On March 31, 302, in a rescript from Alexandria, Diocletian, after consultation with the proconsul for Egypt, ordered that the leading Manicheans be burnt alive along with their scriptures. This was the first time an Imperial persecution ever called for the destruction of sacred literature. Low-status Manicheans were to be executed; high-status Manicheans were to be sent to work in the quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island) or the mines of Phaeno. All Manichean property was to <b>be</b> <b>seized</b> and deposited in the imperial treasury.|$|E
5|$|Antioch was Diocletian's primary {{residence}} from 299 to 302, while Galerius swapped {{places with}} his Augustus on the Middle and Lower Danube. Diocletian visited Egypt once, {{over the winter}} of 301–2, and issued a grain dole in Alexandria. Following some public disputes with Manicheans, Diocletian ordered that the leading followers of Mani be burnt alive along with their scriptures. In a 31 March 302 rescript from Alexandria, he declared that low-status Manicheans must be executed by the blade, and high-status Manicheans must be sent {{to work in the}} quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island, Turkey) or the mines of Phaeno in southern Palestine. All Manichean property was to <b>be</b> <b>seized</b> and deposited in the imperial treasury. Diocletian found much to be offended by in Manichean religion: its novelty, its alien origins, the way it corrupted the morals of the Roman race, and its inherent opposition to long-standing religious traditions. Manichaeanism was also supported by Persia at the time, compounding religious dissent with international politics. Excepting Persian support, the reasons he disliked Manichaenism were equally applicable, if not more so, to Christianity, his next target.|$|E

5|$|Following the French {{surrender}} on 22 June, the French fleet {{was to be}} disarmed under German and Italian supervision, {{under the}} terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would <b>be</b> <b>seized</b> by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralise the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, surrender for internment, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum; the French rejected it, and so the British ships opened fire.|$|E

5|$|In 1793, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic went to {{war with}} the French Republic, joining the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars.

Although war between Britain and the Batavian Republic had not been declared, the British government sent instructions on 19 January for Batavian shipping to <b>be</b> <b>seized</b> and, in conjunction with Stadtholder William of Orange, living in exile in London, for Batavian colonies to be neutralised in order to deny their use to the French. On 9 February these orders culminated in the outbreak of war between Britain and the Batavian Republic.|$|E
