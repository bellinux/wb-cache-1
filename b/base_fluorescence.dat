40|$|The {{interaction}} of amino acid amides with tRNA P h e H I studied by {{measurements of the}} Wye <b>base</b> <b>fluorescence.</b> Binding of phenylalanine-, tyrosine- and tryptophan-aaidea leads to considerable quenching, whereas the asides of e. g. glycine and lencine do not induce quenching nnder the sane conditions. Binding constants at 0, 13 M salt- 100 M" 1 for Phe-, 110 *~ for Tyr- and 300 M~ * for Trp-amide- are about a factor of 6 higher than those evaluated from independent measurements for binding to simple single-stranded polynucleotidea; the corresponding factor is 10 for double-stranded polynucleotides. Since the apparent enthalpy changes derived from measurements at different temperaturea remains relatively low (- 9 to- 20 kJ/mol), the increased affinity appears to be mainly due to an increaae of the entropy changes. Titration experiments performed {{in the presence of}} Mg 2 + indicate cooperative interactions of the aromatio residues with the anticodon loop that are consistent with preferential binding to one of two loop conformations. Measurements of binding constants at different pH-values indicate the protonation of a tENA residue in the tryptophanamido-tRNAPho oomplex characterised by a pi value of about 7. 0. 1...|$|E

Combinations comprising 5, 10, 15 -triphenylporphyrin (TriPP) {{on both ends of}} the ethene- 1, 2 -diyl bridge M 210 (M 2 =H 2 /Ni, Ni 2, Ni/Zn, H 4, H 2 Zn, Zn 2) and 5, 15 -bis(3, 5 -di-tert-butylphenyl) porphyrinato-nickel(II) on one end and H 2, Ni, and ZnTriPP on the other (M 211), enable the first studies of this class of compounds possessing intrinsic polarity. The compounds were characterized by electronic absorption and steady state emission spectra, 1 H NMR spectra, and for the Ni 2 bis(TriPP) complex Ni 210, single crystal X-ray structure determination. The crystal structure shows ruffled distortions of the porphyrin rings, typical of Ni II porphyrins, and the (E) -C 2 H 2 bridge makes a dihedral angle of 50 ° with the mean planes of the macrocycles. The result is a stepped parallel arrangement of the porphyrin rings. The dihedral angles in the solid state reflect the interplay of steric and electronic effects of the bridge on interporphyrin communication. The emission spectra in particular, suggest energy transfer across the bridge is fast in conformations in which the bridge is nearly coplanar with the rings. Comparisons of the fluorescence behaviour of H 410 and H 2 Ni 10 show strong quenching of the free <b>base</b> <b>fluorescence</b> when the complex is excited at the lower energy component of the Soret band, a feature associated in the literature with more planar conformations.

40|$|Revised version. "Available online 10 August 2014 "In this work, we {{were able}} to obtain the benzothieno[3, 2 -b]quinoline 1 and benzothieno[2, 3 -c]quinoline 2 using a new one-pot {{procedure}} from the reaction of the commercially available 3 -bromobenzo[b]thiophene- 2 -carbaldehyde with 2 -aminophenylpinacolborane under Suzuki coupling conditions using a stereochemically hindered ligand, 2 -(cyclohexylphosphane) biphenyl and Ba(OH) 2. 8 H 2 O as the <b>base.</b> <b>Fluorescence</b> properties of the benzothieno[3, 2 -b]quinoline 1 and the benzothieno[2, 3 -c]quinoline 2 were studied in solvents of different polarity. Both compounds exhibit a solvent sensitive emission, compound 1 being less fluorescent (quantum yield < 0. 05) than compound 2 (quantum yield between 0. 04 and 0. 10). The interaction of these compounds with salmon sperm DNA and synthetic double-stranded heteropolynucleotides, poly(dA–dT) •(dA–dT) and poly(dG–dC) •(dG–dC), was studied using spectroscopic methods, allowing the determination of the intrinsic binding constants and binding site sizes. The interaction of both compounds is stronger with adenine-thymine (A-T) base pairs. Compound 1 is the most intercalative in salmon sperm DNA (47 %) and polynucleotides (46 %- 49 % of intercalated molecules), while for compound 2, 41 % is intercalated in salmon sperm DNA and only 8 % in poly(dG–dC) •(dG–dC). Docking studies indicate that compound 1 interacts more strongly with DNA than compound 2, with a significant value of binding free energy in the case of intercalation. Minor groove binding is also very favorable and, probably, both mechanisms occur with a preponderance of intercalation in the case of compound 1. Overall, these results indicate that both benzothienoquinolines interact with nucleic acids by both intercalation and groove binding.

Conventional fluoroimmunoassay uses time-resolved luminescence techniques, with detection in the visible range, to eliminate the fluorescence background from the biological specimens. By using an immunoassay based on functionalized Y(2) O(3) :Nd(3 +) nanoparticles, where the excitation and emission processes in the Nd(3 +) ion occur in the near-infrared (NIR) region, we have succeeded in eliminating the interferences from the biological fluorescence background, avoiding the use of time-resolved techniques. This yields higher emission intensity from the Nd(3 +) -nanolabels and efficient detection of anti-oxidized low-density lipoproteins (anti-oxLDL) by Y(2) O(3) :Nd(3 +) -antibody-antigen conjugation, leading to a novel biolabeling method.

Methods Fluorescence imaging was performed on MGH human bladder tumor xenografted on both the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and the murine model using a fluorescence endoscopy imaging system. In addition, fiber optic <b>based</b> <b>fluorescence</b> spectroscopy was performed on tumors and various normal organs in the same mice to validate the macroscopic images. In one patient, fluorescence imaging was performed on angiosarcoma lesions and normal skin in conjunction with fluorescence spectroscopy to validate Ce 6 -PVP induced fluorescence visual assessment of the lesions. Results Margins of tumor xenografts in the CAM model were clearly outlined under fluorescence imaging. Ce 6 -PVP-induced fluorescence imaging yielded a specificity of 83 % on the CAM model. In mice, fluorescence intensity of Ce 6 -PVP was higher in bladder tumor compared to adjacent muscle and normal bladder. Clinical results confirmed that fluorescence imaging clearly captured the fluorescence of Ce 6 -PVP in angiosarcoma lesions and good correlation was found between fluorescence imaging and spectral measurement in the patient. Conclusion Combination of Ce 6 -PVP induced fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy could allow for optical detection and discrimination between cancer and the surrounding normal tissues.
