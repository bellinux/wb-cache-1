40|$|Perceived blur is an {{important}} measure of image quality and clinical visual function. The magnitude of image blur varies across space and time under natural viewing conditions owing to changes in pupil size and accommodation. Blur is frequently studied in the laboratory {{with a variety of}} digital filters, without comparing how the choice of filter affects <b>blur</b> <b>perception.</b> We examine the perception of image blur in synthetic images composed of contours whose orientation and curvature spatial properties matched those of natural images but whose blur could be directly controlled. The images were blurred by manipulating the slope of the amplitude spectrum, Gaussian low-pass filtering or filtering with a Sinc function, which, unlike slope or Gaussian filtering, introduces periodic phase reversals similar to those in optically blurred images. For slope-filtered images, blur discrimination thresholds for over-sharpened images were extremely high and perceived blur could not be matched with either Gaussian or Sinc filtered images, suggesting that directly manipulating image slope does not simulate the perception of blur. For Gaussian and Sinc blurred images, blur discrimination thresholds were dipper-shaped and were well-fit with a simple variance discrimination model and with a contrast detection threshold model, but the latter required different contrast sensitivity functions for different types of blur. Blur matches between Gaussian and Sinc blurred images were used to test several models of <b>blur</b> <b>perception</b> and were in good agreement with models based on luminance slope, but not with spatial frequency based models. Collectively, these results show that the relative phases of image components, in addition to their relative amplitudes, determines perceived blur...|$|E

40|$|Background: In 2010 {{policy changes}} were {{introduced}} to the Australian healthcare system that granted nurse practitioners access to the public health insurance scheme (Medicare) subject to a collaborative arrangement with a medical practitioner. These changes facilitated nurse practitioner practice in primary healthcare settings. This study investigated the experiences and perceptions of nurse practitioners and medical practitioners who worked together under the new policies and aimed to identify enablers of collaborative practice models. Methods: A multiple case study of five primary healthcare sites was undertaken, applying mixed methods research. Six nurse practitioners, 13 medical practitioners and three practice managers participated in the study. Data were collected through direct observations, documents and semi-structured interviews as well as questionnaires including validated scales to measure the level of collaboration, satisfaction with collaboration and beliefs in the benefits of collaboration. Thematic analysis was undertaken for qualitative data from interviews, observations and documents, followed by deductive analysis whereby thematic categories were compared to two theoretical models of collaboration. Questionnaire responses were summarised using descriptive statistics. Results: Using the scale measurements, nurse practitioners and medical practitioners reported high levels of collaboration, were highly satisfied with their collaborative relationship and strongly believed that collaboration benefited the patient. The three themes developed from qualitative data showed a more complex and nuanced picture: 1) Structures such as government policy requirements and local infrastructure disadvantaged nurse practitioners financially and professionally in collaborative practice models; 2) Participants experienced the influence and consequences of individual role enactment through the co-existence of overlapping, complementary, traditional and emerging roles, which <b>blurred</b> <b>perceptions</b> of legal liability and reimbursement for shared patient care; 3) Nurse practitioners’ and medical practitioners’ adjustment to new routines and facilitating the collaborative work relied on the willingness and personal commitment of individuals. Conclusions: Findings {{of this study suggest that}} the willingness of practitioners and their individual relationships partially overcame the effect of system restrictions. However, strategic support from healthcare reform decision-makers is needed to strengthen nurse practitioner positions and ensure the sustainability of collaborative practice models in primary healthcare...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Indocyanine green video-angiography is a {{recently}} popularised technique for imaging the retina and choroid. Little {{is known about}} the value of this technique in the evaluation of choroidal tumours. METHODS [...] Indocyanine green video-angiograms of 51 patients with choroidal tumours, including 32 with choroidal melanoma, five with choroidal naevus, four with choroidal metastasis, four with choroidal haemangioma, one with choroidal osteoma, one with choroidal vortex vein varix, and four with irradiated choroidal melanoma were reviewed in a masked fashion. RESULTS [...] The choroidal melanoma group achieved maximal fluorescence at an average of 18. 2 (range 0. 4 to 60) minutes after injection. At maximum fluorescence, the pattern varied from hypofluorescent in 17 cases, to isofluorescent in eight cases, and hyperfluorescent in seven cases. Non-pigmented choroidal melanoma generally showed an earlier average onset of fluorescence than the pigmented choroidal melanoma (mean 28 versus 185 seconds, respectively) (p = 0. 04). The two subgroups otherwise overlapped substantially in angiography characteristics. The choroidal metastasis group demonstrated maximal fluorescence at an average of 8. 9 (range 1. 7 to 13) minutes. All choroidal metastases had a homogeneous diffuse fluorescence with late isofluorescence. The choroidal metastases allowed a subtle <b>blurred</b> <b>perception</b> of the normal choroidal pattern through the tumour. The choroidal haemangioma group revealed very characteristic findings with an onset of filigree fluorescence at an average of 0. 6 (range 0. 4 to 0. 7) minutes with little variation. The maximal fluorescence was typically hyperintense in all cases and was achieved at an average of 1. 2 minutes and was reached by 1. 8 minutes in all cases. In these cases the fluorescence appeared as a lacy diffuse 'fluorescent mulberry' pattern with visibility of the vascular channels and demonstrated 'washout' of the dye in the late frames. CONCLUSION [...] Indocyanine green may be a useful adjunct in the differentiation of amelanotic choroidal melanoma, choroidal metastasis, and choroidal haemangioma. The different patterns of fluorescence may be explained by the intrinsic choroidal vascular architecture in these three tumours...|$|R

The group mean total DOF progressively increased linearly with target size. Based on the individual DOF responses, the group was categorized into two subgroups: a predominantly centrally-driven and a centrally plus peripherally-driven subgroup. The results implicated partial cone pooling of blur information, as well as influence from perceptual, attentional, and optical aspects. However, the subgroup response profiles suggested individual differences in the weighting of the near peripheral blur information at the retinal level, and perhaps at higher-level areas of the visual system, involving spatial integration and global attentional processing...|$|E
30|$|But how can {{adaptation}} to different spectral slopes alter {{the salience of}} fine detail in the image (blur after-effects) when {{it does not seem}} to alter the sensitivity to fine detail (as measured by the contrast sensitivity function)? The answer to this question is complex but is likely to reflect the complex relationship between threshold sensitivity and suprathreshold appearance. The actual basis of <b>blur</b> <b>perception</b> in the visual system is in fact poorly understood – it is not clear whether blur is coded as a feature that is present in images (e.g. the fuzziness of edges) vs one that is absent (e.g. inability to see expected details). In the former case, it is also unknown whether the attribute of blur is coded as an explicit image feature or implicitly by the pattern of energy across different spatial scales. For example, Elliott et al. (2011) showed that how blur adaptation normalizes subjective judgments of focus can be accounted for by how adaptation alters the balance of responses across multiple narrowly tuned spatial frequency mechanisms.|$|E
40|$|Cultural tourism {{provides}} {{opportunities for}} ethnic minorities to showcase their cultures, customs and heritage. At the same time, it causes {{a series of}} tensions and issues of authenticity and commodification have been the subjects of lively debate among tourism researchers. However, {{little research has been}} done to date concerning the roles of stakeholders who authenticate cultural resources. This thesis develops a conceptual framework that is employed to enhance understanding of the authenticity of cultural tourism when ethnic Li communities in Hainan Island, China, experience tourism development. Folk villages are used as a significant point of access for investigating the tensions which emerge in authenticating cultural resources. Four key stakeholders are identified: (1) governments; (2) tourism businesses; (3) visitors; and, (4) ethnic communities. Five pairs of yardsticks were developed based upon Swain's (1989) work to examine the issue of authentification. These constructs are: non-commercialization versus commodification, cultural evolution versus museumification, economic development versus cultural preservation, ethnic autonomy versus state regulation, and mass tourism development versus sustainable cultural tourism. The findings suggest that authenticity is relative rather than absolute and, like beauty, {{is in the eye of}} the beholder. Therefore, it is necessary to shift from a previous focus on the nature and identification of authenticity to the more tractable question of authentification. The various stakeholders exhibit different positions with respect to the various paradoxes and the tensions that exist between their poles. For example, governments pay more attention on the control of ethnic autonomy whilst tourism businesses prioritize the economic development. Tourists exhibit <b>blurred</b> <b>perceptions</b> of authenticity whilst ethnic minority supports the maintenance of their of culture but gives priority to jobs and remuneration. This thesis demonstrates that it is more useful to evaluate who authenticates and the interests that such claims serve, rather than to adhere to some absolute standard of 'authentic' ethnicity. It makes recommendations for tourism planners, such as ethnic participation in the decision-making process, the development of strategic alliance among tourism stakeholders, and the taking of steps to promote the maintenance of Li culture. It also suggests opportunities for applying this conceptual framework of cultural tourism to other different situations, both within Hainan and elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|Humans {{are able}} to detect {{blurring}} of visual images, but the mechanism by which they do so is not clear.

We propose a technique for coarse-to-fine phase prediction of wavelet coefficients, and observe that (1) such predictions are highly effective in natural images, (2) phase coherence increases with the strength of image features, and (3) blurring disrupts the phase coherence relationship in images.

30|$|A similar method found in[21, 32] improves[29] by {{addition}} {{of the concept of}} commutative probability of blur detection (CPBD) so that the method should estimate the quality by including the impact of HVS sensitivity towards <b>blur</b> <b>perception</b> at different contrast levels. Testing the proposed method upon three public image databases having different blur types reveals that the method performance is considerably better than some of the contemporary sharpness/blur methods. However, this method gives a quality index in a continuous range of 0 to 1 and the authors have modified it in[33] where it gives a quality value on a discrete scale of 1 to 5, the usual five quality classes which are described from Bad to Excellent. Given that blur estimation methods most often work on the idea of measurement of edge-spread and blur manifests itself in smooth or diminished edges, some edges may remain undetected. Varadarajan et al.[34] improved the method proposed in[29] by incorporating an edge refinement method to enhance the edge detection and hence outperformed the blur assessment.

40|$|International audienceTo {{achieve the}} best image quality, noise and {{artifacts}} are generally removed {{at the cost}} of a loss of details generating the blur effect. To control and quantify the emergence of the blur effect, blur metrics have already been proposed in the literature. By associating the blur effect with the edge spreading, these metrics are sensitive not only to the threshold choice to classify the edge, but also to the presence of noise which can mislead the edge detection. Based on the observation that we have difficulties to perceive differences between a blurred image and the same reblurred image, we propose a new approach which is not based on transient characteristics but on the discrimination between different levels of blur perceptible on the same picture. Using subjective tests and psychophysics functions, we validate our <b>blur</b> <b>perception</b> theory for a set of pictures which are naturally unsharp or more or less blurred through one or two-dimensional low-pass filters. Those tests show the robustness and the ability of the metric to evaluate not only the blur introduced by a restoration processing but also focal blur or motion blur. Requiring no reference and a low cost implementation, this new perceptual blur metric is applicable in a large domain from a simple metric to a means to fine-tune artifacts corrections...|$|E
