They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> her own garden. In {{a letter to a}} friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't {{want to come back to}} New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand! Two dogs, an aviary full of exotic birds, tomatoes, grapes, strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, lovely flowers (camellias too!), right in our own little world.|$|E
5|$|The {{applications}} from Tone intrigued the Directory, which understood that by attacking Ireland {{they would be}} striking at the least defensible part of the British Isles. Support for the British government was weakest there and the United Irishmen optimistically claimed to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> an irregular army {{of as many as}} 250,000 waiting to join the French once they had landed, with the additional attraction that a successful establishment of an Irish Republic would prove an ideological coup for the French Republic. Finally and most significantly, a large expeditionary force in Ireland could provide an ideal springboard for an invasion of Britain, especially in combination with a plan then under development to land 2,000 uniformed criminals in Cornwall, who would distract the British Army during the invasion of Ireland and could potentially provide a beachhead for future operations.|$|E

25|$|The army's role in {{internal}} security was largely {{taken over by}} the formation of the Police Corps of Andorra in 1931. Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the French National Gendarmerie, with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard. The Andorran Army was reformed in the following year, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles. The force consisted of six Corporals, one for each parish (although there are currently seven parishes, there were only six until 1978), plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action, and a commander with the rank of major. It was the responsibility of the six corporals, each in his own parish, to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish.|$|E

500|$|In {{a meeting}} of Scots and Regulator leaders at Cross Creek on February 5, there was {{disagreement}} on how to proceed. [...] The Scots wanted {{to wait until the}} British troops had actually arrived before mustering, while the Regulators wanted to move immediately. [...] The views of the latter prevailed since they claimed to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> 5,000 men, while the Scots expected to raise only 700 to 800. [...] When the forces mustered on February 15, there were about 3,500 men, but the number rapidly dwindled over the next few days. [...] Many men had expected to be met and escorted by British troops and did not relish the possibility of having to fight their way to the coast. [...] When they marched three days later, Brigadier General Donald MacDonald led between 1,400 and 1,600 men, predominantly Scots. This number was further reduced over the coming days as more men deserted the column.|$|E

They also lost their bonus for , as the game failed to meet Bethesda's standard—an aggregate review score of 85 at Metacritic—by 1 point. The team lacked sufficient resources to keep the company's operation running. According to Adam Brennecke, an executive producer at Obsidian, if they failed to pitch a project to a publisher in time they would have exhausted their money and gone bankrupt. At that time, the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter was growing popular and Josh Sawyer, creative director of New Vegas, proposed that the studio put their cancelled game on Kickstarter and attempt to secure funding for it there. Some team members were skeptical about the idea and feared {{that they may not}} even <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> $100,000 through the platform. The question of whether to pursue a Kickstarter campaign led to numerous debates between key members of the company. The debates ended when Double Fine Adventures campaign launched and saw huge success. Secure in the belief that Kickstarter was a viable funding option, the team decided to use it to fund the development of a game they wanted to make for a very long time: a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate. The Kickstarter campaign for Pillars of Eternity was launched in September 2012 under the working name [...] "Project Eternity", with Obsidian requesting $1.1 million. The studio approached Kickstarter with the mindset that if their campaign was successful the game could eventually be turned into a franchise, while if they were unsuccessful, they would attempt to refine their ideas and try again with another campaign. Obsidian's campaign was hugely successful, raising $4 million and breaking the record set by Double Fine Adventure. Pillars of Eternity was released in March 2015 to a positive critical reception. Paradox Interactive served as the game's publisher. Obsidian planned an expansion pack, called [...] It was divided into two different parts, one of which was released on August 25, 2015, and the other on February 16, 2016. A board game for Pillars of Eternity titled Pillars of Eternity: Lords of the Eastern Reach was announced on May 19, 2015. It was developed by Zero Radius Games with input provided by Obsidian. Like the main game, it was funded through a Kickstarter campaign, and it reached its funding goal within a day.|$|E
