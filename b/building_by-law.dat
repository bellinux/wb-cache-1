50|$|Some {{national}} and regional governments may issue model codes, such as a model building code. Examples include the National Building Code of Canada, the National Fire Code of Canada and Germany's MBO - Musterbauordnung. All three aforementioned examples are issued as guideline documents, which are then used by their Provinces and Bundesländer, respectively, as a baseline to author their own building codes, such as the Ontario Building Code (OBC) and fire codes, such as the Alberta Fire Code (AFC), respectively, which must then, in turn, also be adopted by the municipalities, before they become local law, which is then locally enforced by the municipalities. Usually, the municipality passes a by-law to adopt the code, so the same book applies across that whole territory or Province, etc.. Alternatively, a municipality may elect to issue its own version, such as The City of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which typically makes its own changes to the British Columbia Building Code (BCBC), and then issues its own Vancouver <b>Building</b> <b>By-law,</b> rather than to simply adopt the BCBC, as all other municipalities in British Columbia do.|$|E

40|$|India is {{experiencing}} fast income growth and urbanization, and {{this leads to}} unprecedented increases in demand for building energy services and resulting energy consumption. In response to rapid growth in building energy use, the Government of India issued the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) in 2007, {{which is consistent with}} and based on the 2001 Energy Conservation Act. ECBC implementation has been voluntary since its enactment and a few states have started to make progress towards mandatory implementation. Rajasthan is the first state in India to adopt ECBC as a mandatory code. The State adopted ECBC with minor additions on March 28, 2011 through a stakeholder process; it became mandatory in Rajasthan on September 28, 2011. Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh have started to draft an implementation roadmap and build capacity for its implementation. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) plans to encourage more states to adopt ECBC in the near future, including Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Delhi. Since its inception, India has applied the code on a voluntary basis, but the Government of India is developing a strategy to mandate compliance. Implementing ECBC requires coordination between the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of Urban Development at the national level as well as interdepartmental coordination at the state level. One challenge is that the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), the enforcement entities of <b>building</b> <b>by-laws,</b> lack capacity to implement ECBC effectively. For example, ULBs in some states might find the building permitting procedures to be too complex; in other cases, lack of awareness and technical knowledge on ECBC slows down the amendment of local <b>building</b> <b>by-laws</b> as well as ECBC implementation. The intent of this white paper is to share with Indian decision-makers code enforcement approaches: through code officials, third-party inspectors, or a hybrid approach. Given the limited capacity and human resources available in the state and local governments, involving third-party inspectors could rapidly expand the capacity for plan reviews and broad implementation. However, the procedures of involving third-parties need to be carefully designed in order to guarantee a fair process. For example, there should be multiple checks and certification requirements for third-party inspectors, and the government should have the final approval when third-party inspectors are used in a project. This paper discusses different approaches of involving third-parties in ECBC enforcement; the Indian states may choose the approaches that work best in their given circumstances...|$|R

The originality of the study is that it is the first complete history of the regulations. The study concentrates upon the regulations which relate primarily to building design and construction. Particular emphasis is placed on the national trend, as exemplified by the Model <b>Building</b> <b>By-laws</b> in conjunction with the influential role played by the London Building Acts. Reference is also made, by way of illumination, to the content and implementation of various local <b>building</b> acts and <b>by-laws.</b> The pressures which affected the building regulations - from society from more complex buildings, new building types and new materials for example - are all duly assessed. As a result the work reflects upon a number of lesser known facets of the Victorian building world. The material used has included the Acts and By-laws themselves, commentaries and opinions contained in contemporary journals papers and reports, as well as the discussion in Parliamentary debate and at the meetings of the Professional bodies. The first three chapters describe i three separate routes into the subject : the sanitary reform movements the legislation in London, and provincial activities. The sequence of chapters then proceeds chronologically, alternating between London and the Provinces highlighting the principal London regulations of 18449 1855 and 1894 and the Model By-laws of 18581 1877 and 1890.

Furthermore, a total of 298 households from the selected house types were surveyed. Two house types were found not to comply with the Uniform <b>Building</b> <b>By-Law</b> (UBBL) governing NV provisions in Malaysia and those house types that complied were found to exhibit higher ventilation rates. Occupants’ level of satisfaction when utilising NV was found to be significantly related to opening sizes complying with UBBL, longer duration of opening windows, and occupants’ means of achieving comfort.

From the initial survey, {{it was found that the}} squatter houses are built without conforming to the Building by-laws. Some of the buildings will pose danger to the residents. Therefore the aim of this study is to explore the problems of the squatter houses and steps to taken by the authorities to achieve Zero Squatter’s area. The objectives of this study are to study the requirements of the <b>building</b> <b>by-law</b> of the existing squatter area, to evaluate the problems faced by the residents of the squatter houses, to evaluate the reasons given by the residents regarding on relocating them and to identify the steps taken by authorities in order to achieve Zero Squatter’s Areas. The study is carried out inKempas, Johor Bahru. The study is conducted through questionnaires, interviews and on site visit. A total of 94 questionnaires were distributed to the respondents and 57 questionnaires were returned duly answered. The data is analysed using the average index. From the study, it is found that there is no the requirement of the <b>building</b> <b>by-law</b> for squatter area. The problems faced by the residents of squatter houses are the distance between one building to another is too close, therefore the risk of exposing to fire is very high. The area does not have appropriate garbage bin, i. e. garbage disposal. Other problems are social problems among teenagers and sewerage system difficult to pump out. The reasons given by the residents of squatter regarding on relocating the residents are the size of the house provided by the government is small; the location of the house is far away from their working places and the government providing a high-rise housing type to the squatters. i. e: PPR. Meanwhile high-rise housing is not suitable for senior citizens. The steps taken by the authorities to achieve Zero Squatter Area are providing the squatters with more PPR (ProjekPerumahan Rakyat), providing more low-cost flats with soft housing loan offered and providing more low-cost housing and considering of giving Temporary Occupation License (TOL) to the squatters...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. It all starts or fails with energy managers! No energy manager in a firm means no voice to invest in energy efficiency. No voice implies no annual budget for energy conservation measures. Having no annual budget means no energy efficiency measures are implemented. No implementation results in less profit and no energy cost reduction. It is expected from an energy manger to follow a sequential and iterative procedure and suggest design improvements in existing energy systems. In line with the Government‟s effort to be more energy efficient as indicated within the Strategic Plans of Saudi Arabia, the Energy Efficiency (EE) programmes would focus especially in the industrial and commercial sectors. With the proposed introduction of Efficient Management of Electrical Energy Regulation, amendments to the Uniform <b>Building</b> <b>By-laws,</b> labelling of electrical appliances {{and the use of}} high-efficient motors, the focus on energy efficiency within the commercial and industrial sector would be further enhanced. These developments coupled with the recent increase in energy cost worldwide spells a real need to develop local experts with the required knowledge and experience in energy efficiency. As energy and environmental problems intensify, there is urgent demand nationwide for energy managers who can set up and implement real practical solutions. It is not just concerned with saving energy, but also with increasing productivity, improving standards of living and saving money.

The existing terraced house design complies with the minimum requirement of natural ventilation as stipulated in the Malaysian Uniform <b>Building</b> <b>By-Law.</b> Unfortunately, the architectural design solutions do not permit good natural ventilation for thermal comfort. This can be illustrated by the low internal air velocity and high temperature experienced during the day time. The wind effect is also not well captured especially in the single sided ventilation. Solar chimney ventilation has been suggested by many researcher as possible alternative techniques for natural ventilation. The solar chimney study in this research involved both physical modelling and computer simulation using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique. The specific software called Flo Vent is used. Validation of CFD FloVent is done by comparing the computer simulation result with the field measurement on site and in experiment existing terraced house. The result of the final model solar chimney prototype shows that it can increase indoor air velocity until 0. 8 m/s. The other important factor is that it can continuously induce the flow of natural ventilation regardless of the available wind outside of the house. This effect is significant toward improving the thermal comfort performance in the terraced house through passive natural ventilation...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{modified}} version of a paper delivered at a Conference on the methodology of planning and development held at Trois-Rivières on May 19 - 20, 1977. Much of municipal control of urban development in Canada today is carried out through the regulatory process. Master plans, zoning, subdivision control and <b>building</b> <b>by-laws</b> are the mainstays of this system. In recent years, the legislatures of most Canadian provinces have incorporated in their respective Planning Acts certain mechanisms designed to improve the municipal regulatory response to the challenge of urban change. These mechanisms often appear to be needlessly complicated, whereas they are in fact designed to circumvent certain difficulties which are inherent in the classical regulatory system. The main objectives which these new mechanisms seek to attain are greater flexibility in the decision-making process, better phasing of development and increased public participation at all levels of planning and decision-making. This article concentrates on the law of the province of Québec, but reference is frequently made to the legislation of other Canadian jurisdictions in order to indicate which avenues might be followed in Québec in order to reform the law governing municipal planning by-laws. After a brief introduction, the second Part of this article is devoted to canvassing the principal legal rules governing municipal planning bylaws: first, with respect to by-laws in general; second, with respect to the extent of the limited powers delegated to municipalities; third, with respect to the adoption and amendment procedure for planning by-laws. The third Part is devoted to a comparative analysis of certain legal mechanisms some of which have become commonplace in other Canadian provinces but which remain largely untried in Quebec. These include minor variances, conditional uses, bonus zoning, site plan by-laws, contract zoning and development control. All of these techniques tend to favour greater flexibility in the administration of land-use planning. Other devices are more useful in seeking to achieve phased development. These include holding by-laws and the requirement that land be serviced before a building permit will issue (the latter technique has been in use in Quebec for many years and is authorized to a limited extent by statute). The article concludes by pointing out that some of the mechanisms canvassed would be of considerable use to town planners in Quebec and should be recognized by statute, preferably in the forthcoming Planning Bill which the present government has promised to introduce in the near future. Town planners should be wary of using them without such legislative sanction, however, because the Canadian courts, with limited exceptions such {{as in the case of}} holding by-laws, have struck down attempts by municipalities to step outside the limited statutory authority vested in them...|$|R

The study asks the question: What {{is the role of}} building regulations in sustainable local governance as provided for in South African environmental and local government legislation? Schedule 4 (B) in conjunction with section 156 (1) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (hereafter the Constitution) states that local government has the power to execute law–making and executive powers in relation to building regulations. The Constitution further provides in section 24, the environmental right, read together with section 152 (1) that municipalities are co–responsible with the other two spheres of government to protect the environment and to secure an environment that is not detrimental to the health or well–being of people. The Local Government: Municipal Systems Act 32 of 2000 in section 4 (2) (d), (i) and (j) further states that municipalities have the duty to provide services that is effective, fair and sustainable. Municipalities are bound by national legislation (including the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 and national legislation dealing with building regulations, specifically the National Building Regulations and Building Standards Act 103 of 1977) in how it deals with and within the environment. The South African National Standards (SANS) 10400 –XA: 2011 finds its application specifically on environmental sustainability and energy usage in buildings. The link between these laws and instruments (such as SANS and other projects) and the notion of "green building" is explored in this dissertation. Municipalities in the Western Cape Province are making an effort to adhere to the above national laws. More specifically the City of Cape Town has a Problem <b>Building</b> <b>By–law</b> and the Drakenstein Municipality (Paarl) has a green building manual to regulate "green building" and "green design". With reference to these two municipalities, this study serves to show that some South African municipalities strive toward "green building" and "green design", but more have to be done nationally in order to be pro–active in this regard.

40|$|Utilization of {{palm oil}} fuel ash (POFA) {{which is an}} abundantly {{generated}} waste by Malaysian palm oil industry in producing a new construction material is seen {{as one of the}} ways to reduce the quantity of this by-product disposed at landfill. This thesis presents an experimental study on the engineering properties and durability of aerated concrete consisting of POFA as partial cement replacement, known as POFA cement based aerated concrete. Two types of mixes are prepared. One consists of a control mix whereas another one consists of 20 percent of POFA. The latter has been found to give the highest strength as compared to any other replacements. More than one thousand specimens comprising cubes (70. 6 x 70. 6 x 70. 6 mm), panels (540 x 250 x 25 mm), mortar bars (25 x 25 x 250 mm) and prisms (40 x 40 x 160 mm), (40 x 40 x 50 mm) and (225 x 225 x 25 mm), plates (650 x 100 mm) and (885 x 270 x 25 mm) have been tested in this study. The influences of POFA with numerous replacement level and mixing constituents on compressive strength of aerated concrete have been investigated. The effects of curing methods on the compressive and flexural strengths of the specimens up to one year are also studied. Studies on the durability aspect of the mix are conducted to investigate its acid resistance, sulphate resistance, performance in sea water, carbonation, dimensional stability, as well as fire resistance. POFA aerated concrete is then used to produce panels for the investigation of their compressive strength. The experiments reveal that continuous water curing is the best method in assisting POFA aerated concrete for a higher strength than the ordinary Portland cement (OPC). A constant presence of moisture is significant for the strength development of POFA aerated concrete since pozzolanic reaction can only take place at the later age, after calcium hydroxide is available from the hydration. Utilization of POFA in aerated concrete improves the durability of the lightweight concrete when exposed to aggressive environment, such as acid, sulphate and sea water. The weight loss for OPC specimen is 3. 94 % from its original weight as compared to POFA aerated concrete which lost only 0. 9 % when immersed in hydrochloric acid solution for 1800 hours. Upon exposure to 10 % sodium sulphate solution, OPC mortar bar exhibit map cracks and expand as much as 14 times higher than POFA specimen. Besides that, POFA specimens also demonstrate higher durability to sea water when it exhibits lower strength reduction compared to plain aerated concrete after an exposure to marine environment for one year. The non combustible characteristic of this product and a very low influence on fire growth fulfills the requirement of the highest Class 0 under Clause 204 A in <b>Building</b> <b>By-Law</b> (1984). Finally, the study shows that POFA aerated concrete mix can be used to produce panels with adequate x 25 strength as non load-bearing element in construction...|$|E
