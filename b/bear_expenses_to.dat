60|$|Congress {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the Government has wisely made provision for the relief of distressed seamen in foreign countries. No similar provision, however, has hitherto been made for the relief of citizens in distress abroad other than seamen. It is understood to be customary with other governments to authorize consuls to extend such relief to their citizens or subjects in certain cases. A similar authority and an appropriation to carry it into effect are recommended in the case of citizens of the United States destitute or sick under such circumstances. It is well known that such citizens resort to foreign countries in great numbers. Though most of them are able <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> the <b>expenses</b> incident <b>to</b> locomotion, there are some who, through accident or otherwise, become penniless, and have no friends at home able to succor them. Persons in this situation must either perish, cast themselves upon the charity of foreigners, or be relieved at the private charge of our own officers, who usually, even with the most benevolent dispositions, have nothing to spare for such purposes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Over {{the last}} few years, {{the use of the}} {{simulation}} technologies and the internet in education industry has become wide spread. A Virtual Lab is definitely a large-scale solution to a large-scale problem. Its implementation being very intense, but the benefits of Virtualization Technology greatly facilitates the provisioning of accessibility to Adaptive Learning software. <b>Bearing</b> the <b>expenses</b> <b>to</b> purchase the individual software‘s is not feasible for students, institutions, or the state itself. Cloud VLAB, or simply said a Virtual Laboratory; server-side licensing is taken care of, as software licenses are scalable and costs much less. Cloud computing paradigm promises to deliver the desired hardware to the end user at a low cost with an exceptionally easy to use interface through the commonly available internet. This paper outlines an effort at the Amity University, to deploy a hybrid Infrastructure as a Cloud Service, so as to enhance the student learning and experimenting experience. This paper covers the deployment methods and configurations implemented for OpenStack along with security provisions to deliver the desired computer hardware. The rationale behind the provisions of virtual hardware and the operating system configurations have been defined in great detail supported by examples. This paper also covers how the resources have been used within the taught courses as a Virtual Lab, and in the research projects. The authors also added the Service offering on to the IaaS cloud. The reason behind choosing OpenStack and KVM hypervisor is that both are open source and right now one of the market leaders for cloud computing. This development has led to the student‘s freedom to enhance their practical knowledge...|$|R
