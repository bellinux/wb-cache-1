After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant regional power. Its foreign policy included the covert underwriting of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's strategic position in the area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties within the region. In Uruguay, the <b>bank</b> <b>run</b> by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (Baron and later Viscount of Mauá) became so heavily involved in commercial enterprises that the economy depended on this source of continued capital flow.|$|E
5|$|The panic of 1907 {{occurred}} during a lengthy economic contraction—measured by the National Bureau of Economic Research as occurring between May 1907 and June 1908. The interrelated contraction, bank panic and falling stock market resulted in significant economic disruption.

40|$|We report {{experimental}} {{evidence on the}} effect of observability of actions on <b>bank</b> <b>runs.</b> We model depositors' decision-making in a sequential framework, with three depositors located at the nodes of a network. Depositors observe the other depositors' actions only if connected by the network. Theoretically, a sufficient condition to prevent <b>bank</b> <b>runs</b> is that the second depositor to act is able to observe the first one's action (no matter what is observed). Experimentally, we find that observability of actions affects the likelihood of <b>bank</b> <b>runs,</b> but depositors' choice is highly influenced by the particular action that is being observed. Depositors who are observed by others {{at the beginning of the}} line are more likely to keep their money deposited, leading to less <b>bank</b> <b>runs.</b> When withdrawals are observed, <b>bank</b> <b>runs</b> are more likely even when the mere observation of actions should prevent them...|$|R

5|$|After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick {{transfer}} of power. The Social Credit victory had provoked a <b>bank</b> <b>run,</b> {{and he wanted}} to re-establish stability as quickly as possible. Moreover, the province needed to borrow a large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a lame duck government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, confronted with a dire financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement. Reid responded in January 1936 that there had been no such mismanagement, that the province's financial problems were due to Social Credit's policies, both real and promised, and that had the UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it had been too restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{made worse by}} the fact that Icesave was operating as a branch of Landsbanki, rather than as a legally independent subsidiary. As such, it was completely dependent on the Central Bank of Iceland for emergency loans of liquidity, and could not turn to the Bank of England for help. The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) was aware of the risk, and was considering imposing special liquidity requirements on Icelandic deposit-taking banks in the weeks before the crisis. However the plan – which was never implemented – would have forced the Icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits, and might even have sparked the sort of <b>bank</b> <b>run</b> it was designed to prevent. The Guernsey authorities were also planning on bringing in restrictions on foreign banks operating as branches and on transfers of funds between Guernsey subsidiaries and parent banks ("parental upstreaming"). Landsbanki operated in Guernsey through a legally independent subsidiary.|$|E

40|$|Diamond and Dybvig (JPE, 1983) and the {{subsequent}} literature mod-elled <b>bank</b> <b>runs</b> as a simultaneous-move game, even though empirical evidence indicates that depositors have information about others ´ deci-sion. This paper introduces explicitly sequential moves into the Diamond-Dybvig model. Depositors decide consecutively whether to withdraw their funds or continue holding balances in the bank. If agents can observe the actions of all previous depositors, I show that, contrary to Diamond and Dybvig, there are no <b>bank</b> <b>runs</b> in equilibrium. However, when only with-drawals are observed (and depositors do not know their exact position in the sequence) <b>bank</b> <b>runs</b> re-emerge as possible outcomes. I also consider a third setup in which keeping the funds in the bank is unobservable, but depositors are allowed to make this decision observable, at a cost. If the cost is moderate, {{then there will be}} no <b>bank</b> <b>runs.</b> This result suggests that allowing for communication between the bank and the depositors can help prevent <b>bank</b> <b>runs...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Bank</b> <b>runs</b> in the {{literature}} {{take the form of}} withdrawals of demand deposits payable in real goods, which deplete a fixed reserve of goods in the banking system. That framework describes traditional <b>bank</b> <b>runs</b> based on currency withdrawals as occurred historically in the US and more recently in developing countries. However, in a modern banking system, large withdrawals typically take the form of electronic payments of inside money, with no analog of a depletion of a scarce reserve from the banking system. In a new framework of nominal demand deposits repayable in inside money, pure liquidity-driven <b>bank</b> <b>runs</b> do not occur. If there were excessive early withdrawals, nominal deposits would hedge the bank and flexible monetary prices in the goods market would limit real consumption. The maturity mismatch of short term liabilities and long term assets is not sufficient for multiple equilibria <b>bank</b> <b>runs</b> without other frictions. A key role of the bank is to ensure optimal real liquidity, which allows markets to optimally distribute consumption goods through the price mechanism. <b>Bank</b> <b>runs</b> Inside money Nominal contracts Demand deposits...|$|R

25|$|Banking {{institutions}} in the United States are required to hold reservesamounts of currency and deposits in other banksequal to {{only a fraction of}} the amount of the bank's deposit liabilities owed to customers. This practice is called fractional-reserve banking. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a <b>bank</b> <b>run.</b> Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a lender of last resort when a <b>bank</b> <b>run</b> does occur. Many economists, following Milton Friedman, believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929.|$|E

In one incident, police were called to the branch in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, when two joint account holders barricaded the bank manager in her office after she refused to let them withdraw £1 million from their account. Their money was held in an internet-only account, which they were unable to access after the Northern Rock website failed due to the volume of customers trying to log on.

25|$|The {{ability of}} the bank to borrow money {{reliably}} and economically is crucial, which is why confidence in the bank's creditworthiness is important to its liquidity.

40|$|Diamond and Dybvig (1983) {{provide an}} {{analytical}} framework of modern banking: The key role of banks {{is to provide}} risk sharing between different types of consumers, and the mismatch of short-term liabilities and long-term asset can cause <b>bank</b> <b>runs.</b> In this dissertation, I use Diamond-Dybvig framework to analyze some key issues on banking: banks and the asset market, <b>bank</b> <b>runs</b> and bailouts, and characteristics of deposit contracts. The first chapter addresses the coexistence of banks and the asset market. Jacklin (1987) showed that banks are redundant if the asset market exists. I show {{that if there is}} aggregate liquidity shock, then asset prices will be volatile. This will make the arbitrage opportunities in the market risky. Sufficiently risk-averse depositors will not arbitrage. Hence, incentive-compatibility constraint is relaxed, leaving room for the bank to provide "insurance" to the depositors. The second chapter addresses the relationship between the probability of <b>bank</b> <b>runs</b> and bailouts. Following Keister (2010), my model includes both a private good and a public good. The major innovation in this paper is to determine the run probability by using the global-games approach in Goldstein and Pauzner (2005), making the run probability endogenous. I show that bailouts increase the ex-ante run probability through two channels. The first channel works through the misaligned objectives of the bank and the government: Runs are less costly for banks when there are bailouts. Hence, banks take on more risk than is socially optimal. The second channel works through the change in the depositor's incentives to run: Bailouts increase the probability that a depositor will get her money if she participates in a run, thus increasing the likelihood of a run. The third chapter characterizes how optimal deposit contract is related to the probability of <b>bank</b> <b>runs.</b> Peck and Shell (2003) show that the optimal deposit contract can tolerate <b>bank</b> <b>runs</b> if the run probability is low. In their two-consumer example, the deposit contract is a step function of the run probability. I generalize that example and show that, for some parameters which permit <b>bank</b> <b>runs,</b> the optimal contract changes continuously with the run probability until it reaches the threshold probability level. Above that threshold, the optimal contract eliminates <b>bank</b> <b>runs.</b> Hence, the run probability affects not only whether <b>bank</b> <b>runs</b> will be tolerated (like Peck and Shell's example) but also how <b>bank</b> <b>runs</b> will be tolerated...|$|R
