5|$|A {{phosphatase}} is {{an enzyme}} that uses water to cleave a phosphoric acid monoester into a phosphate ion and an alcohol. <b>Because</b> <b>a</b> phosphatase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of its substrate, it is a subcategory of hydrolases. Phosphatase enzymes {{are essential to}} many biological functions, because phosphorylation (e.g. by protein kinases) and dephosphorylation (by phosphatases) serve diverse roles in cellular regulation and signaling.|$|E

50|$|What you and I {{need to do}} is {{learn to}} forget our differences. When we come {{together}}, we don't come together as Baptists or Methodists.

5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{building}} housed {{a succession of}} tenants, including barber shops and cafés. The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently <b>because</b> <b>a</b> sufficient number of local residents came to its defense. It was eventually deeded {{to the city of}} Wichita Falls. As {{the building}} continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), with the hope that it would eventually be restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District.|$|E
5|$|Again {{assisted}} by convict laborers and two army sergeants, Dubois began searching along the Solo River near Trinil in August 1891. His team soon excavated a molar (Trinil 1) and a skullcap (Trinil 2). Its characteristics were a long cranium with a sagittal keel and heavy browridge. Dubois first {{gave them the}} name Anthropopithecus ("man-ape"), as the chimpanzee was sometimes known at the time. He chose this name <b>because</b> <b>a</b> similar tooth found in the Siwalik Hills in India in 1878 had been named Anthropopithecus, and because Dubois first assessed the cranium to have been about , closer to apes than to humans.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{tangible}} goods, people, techniques, information, {{and ideas}} moved lucidly across the Eurasian landmass {{for the first}} time. For example, John of Montecorvino, archbishop of Beijing founded Roman Catholic missions in India and China and also translated the New Testament into the Mongolian language. Long-distance trade brought new methods of doing business from the far East to Europe; bills of exchange, deposit banking, and insurance were introduced to Europe during the Pax Mongolica. Bills of exchange made it significantly easier to travel long distances <b>because</b> <b>a</b> traveller would not be burdened {{by the weight of}} metal coins.|$|E

5|$|Although Adams has {{experimented with}} {{painting}} with watercolor and oil paints (his 1989 covers for Appleseed were rendered {{with a combination}} of ink, watercolor and color pencil), his color work is so sporadic that he says he has to relearn what he has forgotten in the interim each time, and is usually dissatisfied with the results. <b>Because</b> <b>a</b> significant portion of his income is derived from selling his original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.|$|E
5|$|Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne, later {{stated that}} his client was upset <b>because</b> <b>a</b> fellow soldier had lost a leg in an {{explosion}} on 9 March. It is unclear whether the bombing cited by Browne {{was the same as}} the one described by the villagers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>a</b> Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the match}} there were {{ticketing}} problems <b>because</b> <b>a</b> {{large number of}} fans gained entry to the stadium without valid tickets. After the match, a UEFA spokesman accused Liverpool of having the worst fans in Europe, a claim later denied by UEFA president Michel Platini. Watched by a crowd of 63,000, Milan took the lead when Andrea Pirlo's free-kick deflected off Filippo Inzaghi in the first half. Milan extended their lead {{in the second half}} when Inzaghi scored a second goal. Liverpool scored a late goal through Dirk Kuyt, but were unable to equalise {{before the end of the}} match. Milan won the match 2–1 to win their seventh Champions League.|$|E
5|$|Both series {{have been}} {{released}} on DVD. The DVD is notable <b>because</b> <b>a</b> fan of the show, Craig Robins, bought the rights from 2Entertain, BBC Worldwide's DVD interest, and released {{it on his own}} independent label, Replay DVD. Robins put up £30,000 of his own money to buy the rights and produced the series one disc. As a professional videotape editor, Robins was able to restore the video, and author the disc himself, using a piece of freeware to transcribe the dialogue for the subtitles.|$|E

5|$|Braidwood {{regarded}} Westminster Hall as {{safe from}} destruction by 1:45am, {{partly because of}} the actions of the floating fire engine, but also <b>because</b> <b>a</b> change {{in the direction of the}} wind kept the flames away from the Hall. Once the crowd realised that the hall was safe they began to disperse, and had left by around 3:00am, by which time the fire near the Hall was nearly out, although it continued to burn towards the south of the complex. The firemen remained in place until about 5:00am, when they had extinguished the last remaining flames and the police and soldiers had been replaced by new shifts.|$|E
5|$|Cranham is {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Craohv and in 1201 as Craweno. It means 'spur of land frequented by crows' and is formed from the Old English 'crāwe' and 'hōh'. It contained two Anglo-Saxon manors of Ockendon (Wochenduna) and Cranham (Crawenho). During the Middle Ages, and until around the 15th century, it was also known as Bishop's Ockendon <b>because</b> <b>a</b> large part of its area was owned by the Bishop of London.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{opposition}} from the Knights of Labor who eventually became supporters, on January 23, 1883 the Minneapolis Board of Trade passed resolutions to secure legislation to create a Board of Park Commissioners, and the city ratified a Park Act on April 3, 1883. Loring was the natural choice and was appointed the commission's first president. He was reelected each term and served until 1890 when he insisted on resigning <b>because</b> <b>a</b> property in which he held financial interest was under park board consideration.|$|E
