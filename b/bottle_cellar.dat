40|$|The {{airborne}} yeast flora {{associated with}} four different areas in a Spanish winery was analyzed monthly {{over the course}} of one year (February 2008 –January 2009), in order to characterize the yeasts in this particular ecosystem, an aspect relatively unknown until now. The sampling areas were: vinification, bottling, cask aging and <b>bottle</b> <b>cellar</b> aging. 382 yeasts were identified from two different culture media: one generic for yeasts and the other selective for the Brettanomyces/Dekkera genus. The levels of yeasts present in the air throughout the year were low and the highest presence of yeasts was in the bottling area. Most of the yeasts isolated were members of the non-Saccharomyces groups. Yeasts of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae species were only detected in the air in the vinification area during the vinification period. Sporidiobolus and Cryptococcus were the dominant genera in the air and they were found continuously in every area analyzed. The spoilage yeast Brettanomyces/Dekkera was not detected in any sampling made. This study has been undertaken with a grant from the Government of La Rioja, Spain (FOMENTA 2007 / 04 Project).

50|$|While crusted port is {{required}} to be aged in bottle {{for at least three}} years before it is released to the market, most producers keep the bottles for considerably longer, so they are ready to be drunk when sold, and may be enjoyed by consumers who have no space to <b>cellar</b> <b>bottles.</b> This makes crusted port a popular and affordable alternative to vintage port.|$|R

50|$|At the {{nationalisation}} {{of transport}} in Great Britain on 1 January 1948, {{and the establishment}} of the British Transport Commission, hotels and catering came under the control of BTC's Railway Executive. However, on 1 July 1948 they were separated from direct railway control and placed under British Transport Commission's Hotels Executive, chaired by Lord Inman, who was later succeeded by Sir Harry Methven. At this point the Hotels Executive acquired 55 hotels and 400 station refreshment rooms, along with various golf courses, tennis courts, laundries, wine <b>cellars,</b> <b>bottling</b> stores and even a farm (at St Ives in Cornwall).|$|R
60|$|Now, all is {{activity}} {{on board the}} Tomtit. Except {{the man at the}} helm, every one is occupied with preparations for the banquet of the day. The potatoes, onions, and celery, form one department; the fire and solid cookery another; the washing of plates and dishes, knives and forks, a third; the laying of the cloth on deck a fourth; the concoction of sauces and production of <b>bottles</b> from the <b>cellar</b> a fifth. No man has any particular department assigned to him: the most active republican of the community, for the time being, plunges into the most active work, and the others follow as they please.|$|R
50|$|Strong, direct {{sunlight}} or incandescent light can adversely react with phenolic compounds in wine and create potential wine faults. Delicate, light-bodied white wines run {{the greatest risk}} from light exposure, and for that reason, they are often packaged in darkly tinted wine bottles that offer some protection from the light. Wines packaged in clear, light green and blue colored bottles are the most vulnerable to light, and may need extra precautions for storage. For example, the Champagne house of Louis Roederer uses cellophane wrap to protect its premium cuvee Cristal from light, the wine being packaged in a clear <b>bottle.</b> In the <b>cellar,</b> wines are stored in corrugated boxes or wooden crates to protect the wines from direct light.|$|R
50|$|Next Coopersmith {{appears in}} the church cellar with {{computer}} equipment which {{is assumed to be}} stolen from the school's computer lab as the act itself is never shown. He sets up the computer and runs some inquiries into the requirements for a black mass. Searching through various <b>bottles</b> in the <b>cellar</b> left by Father Estaban, he attempts to initiate a mass but the computer informs him that he is still missing crucial ingredients, namely blood and a consecrated host. At this point, he is nearly discovered by Reverend Jameson, the church's current pastor, who sends him off to the mess hall to eat dinner. After arriving at the mess hall too late for lunch, he befriends the school's good-natured cook who makes a meal for him and shows him a litter of puppies that his dog just had. Coopersmith takes the smallest pup for himself, names him Fred and hides him in the church cellar.|$|R
50|$|Bender {{arrives at}} Hedonismbot's mansion and obtains the <b>bottle</b> from the <b>cellar,</b> but is stopped by an armed Fry. Bender {{declares}} {{that he will}} not steal anything, and Fry happily exclaims that the oracle was wrong. Suddenly, Pickles appears, aiming a gun at both Bender and Fry. Pickles reveals that both visions were a set-up to allow himself to steal the liquor and frame Fry and Bender for the robbery. Pickles states that he wants the liquor to destroy his human brain cells, as he finds his precognition to be an unbearable burden. Fry attempts to shoot Pickles, but the invisible safe guarding the liquor ricochets the bullet and strikes Bender, knocking him down. Pickles shoots Fry down, and proceeds to drink the liquor, successfully damaging his brain and precognitive abilities. However, URL and the police chief choose this moment to appear from behind mirrored glass, and Fry and Bender stand up and expose their bulletproof armor. They reveal they became aware of the set-up when Pickles showed Bender sharing the deadly liquor with the Planet Express crew, which is unlikely to happen as Fry pointed out that Bender is an extremely selfish person and would never share anything (a statement that Bender strongly confirms), thus making the police realize the vision Pickles had shared was an attempt to deceive them.|$|R
5000|$|Woodway House shows three clear {{phases of}} construction, with the cottage orné {{of the early}} 19th century, the old farm {{buildings}} and the tutor's living quarters and a classroom, built before 1825. James Spratt had three sons and six daughters, making home tuition both economical and appropriate.The identifiable remains of the old farm buildings consist firstly of a barn with a hay loft that collapsed in a gale and was demolished in the 1960s. A cobbled courtyard with a deep well, granite trough and pump surrounded by outbuildings which include an upper story which had a ladder running up to it, probably {{for access to the}} stable hand's dwelling. Another pump was located inside the side wing which was the boiler house, with its chimney. The clothes were boiled here on washing days and the pump drew water from the well outside, using a system of lead pipes. A door from the courtyard, now removed, led directly into the main room of what was the living area of the farm. This large room still had a [...] "polished" [...] mud floor in 1951 and the large kitchen fireplace is still present. In the floor of this room was a hatch that led down to a <b>bottle</b> shaped storage <b>cellar</b> with a wood ladder, hidden when the floor was tiled over in the 1950s.|$|R
6000|$|There is a disposition, I know, {{in myself}} {{as well as}} in others, to wriggle away from this verity, to find so much good in the {{collapse}} that has come to the mad direction of Europe for the past half-century as to make it on the whole almost a beneficial thing. But at most I can find it in no greater good than the good of a nightmare that awakens the sleeper in a dangerous place to a realisation of the extreme danger of his sleep. Better had he been awake--or never there. In Venetia Captain Pirelli, whose task it was to keep me out of mischief in the war zone, was insistent upon the way in which all Venetia was being opened up by the new military roads; there has been scarcely a new road made in Venetia since Napoleon drove his straight, poplar-bordered highways through the land. M. Joseph Reinach, who was my companion upon the French front, was equally impressed by the stirring up and exchange of ideas in the villages due to the movement of the war. Charles Lamb's story of the discovery of roast pork comes into one's head with an effect of repartee. More than ideas are exchanged in the war zone, and it is doubtful how far the sanitary precautions of the military authorities avails against a considerable propaganda of disease. A more serious argument for the good of war is that it evokes heroic qualities that it has brought out almost incredible quantities of courage, devotion, and individual romance that did not show in the suffocating peace time that preceded the war. The reckless and beautiful zeal {{of the women in the}} British and French munition factories, for example, the gaiety and fearlessness of the common soldiers everywhere; these things have always been there--like champagne sleeping in <b>bottles</b> in a <b>cellar.</b> But was there any need to throw a bomb into the cellar? ...|$|R
6000|$|I own {{the sport}} had a {{considerable}} fascination for me, and stirred up my languid blood. My brother Hal, when settled on his plantation in Virginia, was perfectly {{satisfied with the}} sports and occupations he found there. The company of the country neighbours sufficed him; he never tired of looking after his crops and people, taking his fish, shooting his ducks, hunting in his woods, or enjoying his rubber and his supper. Happy Hal, in his great barn of a house, under his roomy porches, his dogs lying round his feet; his friends, the Virginian Will Wimbles, at free quarters in his mansion; his negroes fat, lazy, and ragged: his shrewd little wife ruling over them and her husband, who always obeyed her implicitly when living, and who was pretty speedily consoled when she died! I say happy, though his lot would have been intolerable to me: wife, and friends, and plantation, and town life at Richmond (Richmond succeeded to the honour of being the capital when our Province became a State). How happy he whose foot fits the shoe which fortune gives him! My income was five times as great, my house in England as large, and built of bricks and faced with freestone; my wife--would I have changed her for any other wife in the world? My children--well, I am contented with my Lady Warrington's opinion about them. But with all these plums and peaches and rich fruits out of Plenty's horn poured into my lap, I fear I have been but an ingrate; and Hodge, my gatekeeper, who shares his bread and scrap of bacon with a family as large as his master's, {{seems to me to}} enjoy his meal as much as I do, though Mrs. Molly prepares her best dishes and sweetmeats, and Mr. Gumbo uncorks the choicest <b>bottle</b> from the <b>cellar.</b> Ah me! sweetmeats have lost their savour for me, however they may rejoice my young ones from the nursery, and the perfume of claret palls upon old noses! Our parson has poured out his sermons many and many a time to me, and perhaps I did not care for them much when he first broached them. Dost thou remember, honest friend? (sure he does, for he has repeated the story over the bottle as many times as his sermons almost, and my Lady Warrington pretends as if she had never heard it)--I say, Joe Blake, thou rememberest full well, and with advantages, that October evening when we scrambled up an embrasure at Fort Clinton and a clubbed musket would have dashed these valuable brains out, had not Joe's sword whipped my rebellious countryman through the gizzard. Joe wore a red coat in those days (the uniform of the brave Sixty-third, whose leader, the bold Sill, fell pierced with many wounds beside him). He exchanged his red for black and my pulpit. His doctrines are sound, and his sermons short. We read the papers together over our wine. Not two months ago we read our old friend Howe's glorious deed of the first of June. We were told how the noble Rawdon, who fought with us at Fort Clinton, had joined the Duke of York: and to-day his Royal Highness is in full retreat before Pichegru: and he and my son Miles have taken Valenciennes for nothing! Ah, parson! would you not like to put on your old Sixty-third coat? (though I doubt Mrs. Blake could never make the buttons and button-holes meet again over your big body). The boys were acting a play with my militia sword. Oh, that I were young again, Mr. Blake! that I had not the gout in my toe; and I would saddle Rosinante and ride back into the world, and feel the pulses beat again, and play a little of life's glorious game! ...|$|R
