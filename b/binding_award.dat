50|$|The {{historical}} {{starting point}} of the initiative was the Green Belt Resolution of Hof (Germany) in December 1989, {{one month after the}} fall of the Berlin Wall. This document formulated and signed by more than 300 environmentalists from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany initiated the first conservation projects targeting the inner German border. After several achievements, the idea was taken to the European level. After a first conference on the European Green Belt in 2003, it was decided to establish a working group with the World Conservation Union (IUCN) as overall coordinator for its implementation; IUCN together with the Ferto-Hanság National Park in Hungary organized the first meeting of the working group, which took place 9-12 September 2004. In the following, the working group together with stakeholders of the Green Belt elaborated a Programme of Work and proposed representatives in each country along the Green Belt to be officially appointed as National Green Belt Focal Points by the respective Ministry of Environment. A Memorandum of Understanding to jointly protect the Green Belt in Fennoscandia was signed by the Environmental Ministers of Russia, Finland and Norway in 2010. In November 2010, the <b>Binding</b> <b>Award</b> for outstanding contributions to nature conservation was awarded to five individuals for their continuous engagement in protecting the Green Belt.|$|E
5000|$|Kettle {{entered the}} Middle Temple on 2 June 1842, {{was called to}} the bar on 6 June 1845, and {{obtained}} a practice on the Oxford circuit. In 1859, he was appointed judge of the Worcestershire county courts, and subsequently he acted {{as chairman of the}} standing committee for framing the rules for county courts. Kettle took an interest in industrial matters, and was called upon to arbitrate in disputes in the iron and coal trades. He was the first president of the Midland iron trade wages board, and used the influence which this office gave him to persuade masters and men to accept arbitration in their disputes. In 1864, after a strike in the building trade at Wolverhampton had lasted seventeen weeks, Kettle, on invitation from both sides, succeeded in arranging a settlement and ultimately in establishing at Wolverhampton a legally organised system of arbitration. If the delegates of the contending parties could not agree, an independent umpire should have power to make a final and legally <b>binding</b> <b>award</b> between them. The scheme spread to include {{a large part of the}} English building trade. Kettle formed similar boards for the coal trade, the potteries, the Nottingham lace trade, the handmade paper trade, the ironstone trade, and other staples. He was styled the [...] "Prince of Arbitrators", and on 1 December 1880 he was knighted [...] "for his public services in establishing a system of arbitration between employers and employed." [...] In 1890, the postmaster-general, Henry Cecil Raikes, consulted Kettle during the strike of the post-office employees. On 24 November 1882, Kettle was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple. He was one of the senior magistrates and a deputy-lieutenant of Staffordshire, and he was assistant chairman of quarter sessions from 1866 to 1891. He was an artist of some ability, and several of his pictures were publicly exhibited. In 1892 he resigned his office of county court judge, finding that his labours in connection with arbitration occupied the greater part of his time. He died at his residence, Merridale, Wolverhampton, on 6 October 1894, and was buried on 9 October in the Wolverhampton cemetery.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} arbitration for resolving disputes about price formulae in contracts regarding long-term gas supply agreements. Arbitration is preferred because it results in <b>binding</b> <b>awards</b> enforceable under the New York Convention. However, arbitrators frequently treat the dispute as adversarial and put significant weight on the technical language of reopener clauses. A {{closer look at the}} nature of gas price disputes and their contractual underpinnings suggests that standard arbitral process and values are inappropriate. Reopener clauses are tools of co-operation designed to preserve the original bargain {{over a long period of}} time. They are typically drafted in a context of significant uncertainty about future economic trends and neither of the parties are at fault for failing to agree how to apply their contract to the facts surrounding a price review. Another process is needed which emphasises the distinctive nature of gas price arbitration. A possible solution arises in the form of "conciliation-arbitration". Conciliation-arbitration is a process where arbitrators deliberately attempt to encourage settlement through informal evaluation of the dispute, and only use standard adversarial processes if parties still fail to reach settlement. Conciliation-arbitration poses nominal ethical risks that are managed by giving parties the power to opt out at the end of the conciliatory stage. Not every arbitral regime will permit use of this process but the decision should be one for the parties to make...|$|R

Secondly, the arbitrator must be able to observe internal information of the meta-organization, such as the members’ effort levels.

40|$|Doctor Legum - LLDCurrently most {{international}} investment disputes are settled through arbitration. The {{origin of}} this dispute settlement {{system can be}} associated with the recent proliferation of over 3000 Bilateral Investment Treaties. Through this system disputes are settled by autonomous and differently constituted tribunals which have powers to render final and <b>binding</b> <b>awards.</b> The dissatisfied party has very limited opportunity to challenge the rendered award as there are no higher bodies in the hierarchy where a dissatisfied party can lodge an appeal, save for limited procedural challenges which are allowed under the system. These differently constituted tribunals at times reach diametrically opposed decisions on similar facts and those decisions stand side by side and all are considered valid. These inconsistent decisions are leading to lack of consistency and uniformity which in turn affects the legitimacy of the system as a whole. The rules of these institutions do not allow the proceedings to be held in public despite the fact that at times these tribunals question the regulatory powers of the state and state measures on service provision to its citizens. Another issue under the current system is that due to lack of coordination, arbitrators play dual roles: as counsels and arbitrators. This practice compromises the cherished principle of the rule of law. In the effort to address these concerns, stakeholders have suggested a number of possible solutions. The suggested solutions include: invoking res judicata and lis pendens principles; adopting the doctrine of precedent; applying the ‘fork in the road’ principle; adopting the margin of appreciation standard in interpretation of BITs; creating an appellate structure at ICSID and creating a treaty to treaty appellate body. This research submits that, the suggested solutions singularly and cumulatively don not address the legitimacy issues adequately. The research therefore calls {{for the establishment of a}} Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) in order to address the legitimacy issues cumulatively. It is submitted that establishing a Multilateral Investment Agreement (MAI) which provides for creating a standing international investment court with an appellate court is the only solution which addresses all the issues haunting the international investment dispute settlement system. In addition, the research suggests interim solutions which will help to increase the legitimacy of the current system pending the establishment of the MAI and the courts. The interim solutions include: establishment of the investor – state dispute adjudication Centre; effective utilisation of host state courts; mandatory publication of all awards; enhancing the effective use of member states interpretative statement; and forming a working commission to provide basic interpretation and the scope of the basic international investment law principles. These measures are only meant to improve the current system pending the establishment of the MAI and the courts. The research concludes that for the betterment of international investment law, the reform is inevitable and that the benefits would outweigh any demerits...|$|R

The treaty contained not only a commitment to try Turkish officials for war crimes against the Allied Nationals, but also for crimes committed against subjects of the Ottoman Empire of different ethnic origin, in particular the Armenians, concluded in the texts as crime against humanity. Furthermore, the so-called [...] "Just Ruling of Woodrow Wilson (the US President at that time)" [...] by the Treaty of Sèvres recognized an Armenian state much larger than the current Republic of Armenia by determining its Western borders in the Armenian Highlands and Asia Minor. While it was never ratified, there can be found individuals, historians, organisations, or politicians that share the thoughts of Henry C. Theriault (Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Massachusetts) specializing in social and political philosophy; he thinks:...some of its elements retain the force of law and the treaty itself is not superseded by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. In particular, the fixing of the proper borders of an Armenian state was undertaken pursuant to the treaty and determined by a <b>binding</b> arbitral <b>award.</b> Regardless of whether the treaty was ultimately ratified, the committee process determining the arbitral award was agreed to by the parties to the treaty and, according to international law, the resulting determination has legal force regardless of the ultimate fate of the treaty.

40|$|In our time, {{international}} arbitration is increasingly considered {{as the most}} effective dispute settlement mechanism, and hence a necessary tool for promoting international trade and investment. Thus, treaties and laws have been adopted, and specialised institutions have been set up, {{in order to facilitate}} and improve the functioning of arbitration. In Oman, alongside the modernisation of the legal system, since 1984, there has been a progressive trend towards the codification of arbitration and adoption of advanced arbitration laws, such as Decree 47 / 1997 on the Arbitration Law and Decree 29 / 2002, a part of which is on the enforcement of awards, whether domestic, international or foreign. Oman has also joined various important international and regional conventions on arbitration, such as the Washington Convention and particularly the New York Convention on the enforcement of foreign awards. At the regional level, Oman adopted the Charter of the GCC Commercial Arbitration Centre, co-founding the Centre, whose awards are enforceable in all GCC states. A thorough examination of the Omani law of arbitration and case law shows that, under the law, arbitration is a regulated and reliable method of dispute resolution resulting in <b>binding</b> and enforceable <b>awards,</b> with a limited scope for court intervention. The law recognises foreign arbitration, and, to some extent, treats it more favourably, compared to domestic arbitration. It has also a pro-enforcement approach, particularly with regard to international and foreign awards. The present study not only has a developmental perspective, whereby discussing the development of arbitration law in Oman, during the last four decades, but also follows a comparative approach. Hence, various aspects of the Omani arbitration law are compared with international conventions and model laws on arbitration, as well as with arbitration laws of some other Arab and GCC states, particularly Egypt, on whose law the Omani law of arbitration is mainly modelled. It is also assessed what impact the Islamic jurisprudence has had on the arbitration law of Oman. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceOman Ministry of JusticeGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} {{researched}} {{in this article}} (1947 – 1990) the principles of awarding academic degrees were far from stable (or uniform). What is more, difference between individual degrees were of multiple character. In the initial years shortly after the Polish People’s Republic was formed, a lower academic degree was award ed to every higher school graduate. From 1951 on this term referred to degrees awarded to science candidates, and as of 1958 to a degree of a doctor. Secondly, the requirements needed to be satisﬁed {{in order to qualify}} for individual degrees differed and were changing. Thirdly, on and off there were instances where ex emptions were made from the generally <b>binding</b> principles governing <b>awarding</b> of academic degrees, {{especially in the case of}} a science candidate and a doctor. Those exemptions, or exceptional treatment, was justiﬁed by a reference to an exceptional case. Fourthly, lower academic degrees could not always be obtained in every discipline, and the list of the discipline that qualiﬁed candidates for a degree was neither closed nor stable. Fifthly, the rights granted to scientiﬁc councils of institutions of higher education, and later to scientiﬁc councils of units operating within the Polish Academy of Sciences as well, were also changing, mostly to meet the conditions and requirements which those unites were obliged to fulﬁl. Sixthly, depending on the role and position of other bodies or organs involved in the process (the minister competent for schools of higher education, the Main Council of Higher Education, or the Central Qualiﬁcations Committee) their say and role was also changing. For the sake of a certain simpliﬁcation, it may be stated that solutions adopted as a result of the reforms of 1947 and 1951 were comparable, while those implemented in subsequent years, particularly by acts on higher education of 1958, 1982 and 1985 and the act of 1965 on academic degrees and scientiﬁc titles as later amended, differed considerably from earlier solutions. The assessment, from a legal point of view, of the conditions of awarding lower academic degrees in the period researched would, however, have been incom- plete if the organisation of doctoral studies as well as the manner of their delivery leading to the preparation and submission of a doctoral dissertation by a degree candidate, had been examined as well.

40|$|Après avoir observé les réactions des travailleurs en face de notre législation du travail, l'auteur signale les écarts et les {{ruptures}} qui, selon lui, existent présentement entre la réalité économico-sociale et les structures juridiques chez nous. In the Province of Quebec, {{the average}} employee is an orderly, law-abiding citizen. He feells, however, that the legisaltive structure of industrial relations {{must not be}} rigid, definitive, but most flexible and ever mindful {{of the social and}} economic and political facts of life. He believes in a constructive evolution of labor law in which ne wants to participate democratically, through critical and realistic suggestions. The employee agrees that our Labour Relations Act clearly recognizes the right of association among workers, and that the Labour Relations Board will grant a certificate to that union which will group the absolute majority of the employees of a given bargaining unit. But he wonders wether it would not be fairer and really more democratic — as occurs during elections in the larger society — if the results of the vote to establish a majority were calculated, {{not on the basis of}} the number of workers in the bargaining unit, but on that of the workers who have in fact voted in that bargaining unit, so that the indifferent worker be not compelled, as he now is, to silently cast his vote against the union through his own abstention. The parellelism with the larger society would be justified, according to him, by the statement that trade unions are a "must" of our industrial civilization. The employee realizes, moreover, the weakness of his legal position when he lawfully participates in an organizational drive to introduce unionism in a business concern. The Jaw, as everyone knows, forbids dismissal for union activities. But such a form of intimidation is always hard to demonstrate, and anyway, in the case of forbidden practices the griever must seek redress in common law courts, will all accompanying delays and relatively weak sanctions against the culprit. If, however, the union, in order to protects its members, engages into technically illegal acts, such as a premature strike, he becomes literally an "outlaw". In the case of final and <b>binding</b> arbitration <b>awards,</b> such as they exist in the public services where striking is illegal, the union is put in the position of a plaintiff; its demands are weighed, analyzed, challenged, and then decided upon without resort. If the union comes out on top, there will be cases where the employer will refuse to abide by the award; if it loses, no redress can be sought. In the first case, the union's sole recourse, with the permission of the Board, is to sue the employer, and here starts again the long and expensive judicial fight for the practical possession of a right clearly stated in the law. As regards the right to strike, the employee sees that it is granted, under given conditions, by our labour legislation; its practical use, however, is subject to the prescriptions of the criminal code. Such a divergence, while making for technical difficulties, puts the employee in a most awkward and uneasy position in relation to public opinion. On this matter of strikes, the labour legislator has used the timid, reserved approach, which seems to be based on a rather restrictive and repressive philosophy. In the light of this attitude, one must state firmly that labour legislation has already conquered — and must further gain — a certain amount of independance and autonomy with regard to the private body of laws, that it has its own ends and specific techniques, which way or may not be in agreement with civil law. Labor law, furthermore, is collective law. Strike, a collective phenomenon, must be judged by legislation as the same level, while individual acts committed during the strike should be judged isolatedly as such. Strike would therefore cease, in our body of laws, to be solely a juxtaposition of individual acts. This distinction is clearly made in France and other countries. Resort to the judiciary by the employer during the strike is at best an artificial gesture, meant to exert psychological pressures on the strikers and to break their resistance. The employee believes that the gap, the difference between the individual and the collective in matters of law as applied to union recognition and activity must be maintained and stressed, so that ambiguities with respect to the exercise of a clearly granted right finally cease to block the way to industrial harmony and industrial relations realism...|$|R
40|$|L'auteur commente la décision du Comite de la liberté syndicale touchant divers aspects du cadre {{juridique}} des relations du travail dans le secteur public au Québec: le niveau de la négociation collective, les restrictions apportées à l'exercice du droit de grève et la détermination des services essentiels. The Freedom of Association Committee of the International Labour Organization (ILO) rendered a decision, in February 1987, {{concerning the}} legal framework of collective bargaining in Quebec's public sector set forth by An Act Respect ing the Process of Negociation of the Collective Agreements in the Public and Parapublic Sectors, S. Q. 1985, c. 12 (referred to as the Act). This case will {{be known as the}} Case no. 1356. The ILO Constitution establishes freedom of association as one of the fundamental principles on which the Organisation is based. Consequently, membership in ILO entails that a State Member such as Canada has the obligation to implement that constitutional principle. In 1951, the Organisation set up a special machinery to insure the protection of this principle. The machinery involves the examination of complaints by the Committee of Freedom of Association. This Committee is a 9 -member Committee of ILO Governing Body and, like the Governing Body itself, its composition is tripartite: government, workers' and employers' appointees. Complaints are generally submetted by workers organisations of a national or an international level. These complaints may concern States which have not ratified ILO conventions on freedom of association. Since its establishment, the Committee has built up a corpus of decisions and principles covering most aspects of freedom of association and the protection of trade unions rights. The Committee has dealt with more than 1 400 cases. The decision of the Committee deals basically with three issues: level of collective bargaining, determination of salaries for the second and third years of a collective agreement and limitations of the right to strike in the social affairs sector. In the framework of the Act, the collective negociation must take place at the provincial level except those matters defined as being subject to a negociation at the local or regional level. Those matters are defined by the Act in respect to some classes of workers or by the parties in the course of negociation at the national level. Strikes are prohibited in respect to a matter defined as being subject to a negociation at the local or regional level. The Committee doesn't see any violation of the freedom of association when matters subject to negociation at the local or regional level are defined by parties {{in the course of the}} negociation at the national level. In this case, workers' organisations have therefore agreed not to strike on those matters. For the Committee, the situation is not the same when the Act lays down matters subject to negociation at local or regional level. The Committee recommends the modification of the Act to allow parties to decide by mutuel agreement the level at which bargaining should take place. The Act prohibits striking in the course of collective negociation related to the determination of the salaries for the second and third years of a collective agreement. In this respect, the Committee makes a distinction between the education sector and the other sector included in the scope of the Act. In the education sector, the Committee reaffirms that workers must enjoy the right to strike. It means that the Act is not in agreement with the well known principle in accordance to which the prohibition to strike should be limited to public servants and essential services in the strict sense of the term. The Committee considers that workers of the education sector does not fall within the definition of essential services. As regards to civil service and essential services sectors, the Committee acknowledged that the right to strike can be restricted or even prohibited if the said limitations are accompanied by adequate impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage and in which the awards, once made, are fully and promptly implemented. In the present case, in respect to public servants and social affairs sectors, the Committee recommends the establishment of such guarantees. This recommendation means that prohibition of strikes is possible. It also means that the procedure for determining salaries set forth by the Act (that is the regulation adopted by Government) didn't offer any «appropriate guarantees» to workers deprived of a legitimate means of defending their economic and social interest. In the social affairs sector, the Act lays down percentages of workers to be maintained at work in the event of a strike. These percentages vary between 55 % to 90 % depending on the nature of the establishment. According to the complaining organisation, these percentages nullify the exercise of the right to strike. The Committee does not express a specific opinion on that point but it handles the case exactly as if the act prohibited any strike in the social affairs sector therefore endorsing the point of view of the complaining organisation. Consequently, the Committee recommends the establishment of arbitration proceedings with <b>awards</b> <b>binding</b> on both parties. From this recommandation, it should be understood that ail the social affairs sector as defined by the Act is an essential service in the strict sense of the term. It has therefore always been possible for government to restrict or prohibit striking in so far as «appropriate garanties» compensate workers for the limitation thereby placed on their freedom of action...|$|R
40|$|L'auteur fait le point sur l'état actuel de la négociation {{collective}} dans {{la fonction}} publique fédérale canadienne. Il souligne que l'habitude de donner des augmentations salariales en termes procentuels plutôt qu'en termes absolus a considérablement augmenté les écarts de traitement au détriment des fonctionnaires à faibles revenus et que ceci va créer d'importantes tensions dans les futures négociations. Il discute également de la consultation institutionnalisée de la négociation concertée et du rôle que sera appelée à jouer la Commission de la fonction publique. THE FIRST NEGOTIATIONSBefore {{we consider the}} future, {{it is necessary to}} briefly examine {{the past and the present}} since any prediction as to what is in store must relate to our present and past experiences. In the Federal Public Service, we have only had collective bargaining for about six years. We are now in our third round of negotiations. The first was an exhilarating experience with a great deal of mutual good faith, limited expertise on both sides of the bargaining table and a number of very difficult problems. The task of conversion of the former classification system into 72 bargaining units with an occupationally oriented classification system was monumental in scope. We managed to incorporate in those agreements many improvements for our membership, particularly those employees who were previously known as « Prevailing Rate employees ». I rather believe the Treasury Board felt that the initial government negotiators had given away the store in the first round. New faces appeared at the bargaining table and improvements were harder to get in the second round; the honeymoon was over yet employees with limited experience in collective bargaining seemed to think that their representatives needed only to ask and the Treasury Board would provide. If their particular desires were not met in the collective agreement, then obviously their negotiators simply had not asked or demanded. THE PRESENT SITUATIONThe present round of negotiations has been even tougher and at the same time the needs and expectations of employees have increased. Rising expectations result from a number of factors : the principal factor at this time is obviously the rapid inflationary increases in the Consumer Price Index. An employee, particularly one at the lower end of the salary spectrum, is hard hit by inflation. In addition, the T. V. has projected every rich man's life style into every poor man's living room, but rather than being able to acquire that life style, he has difficulty making ends meet. Food prices of basic commodities such as meat, bread, milk, etc. go up weekly, not monthly or yearly as he experienced in the past. Rents continue to go up. His dream of acquiring a home of his own becomes just a pipe dream and his frustrations mount in the process. The timid become tigers. They reject authority and the rules. They are not prepared to play the game as it was planned. They expect immediate, sustained, effective action to meet their demands. What might be considered a great achiement in quieter times is dismissed with an expletive as being little or nothing. Government employees see employees in private industry turning down 12 % increases in one year, $ 2. 90 per hour increases in construction trades and they relate those events to their own collective agreements. As a result agreements nogotiated at the table using the traditional yardstick of comparability with wages paid to similar employees in the private sector have little chance of ratification. So far this year, five tentative agreements have been rejected by the membership in relation to one agreement prior to this year. One rejected settlement provided over 30 % increase in wages plus some additional fringes over a 251 / 2 month period. The settlement was negotiated under the pressure of an illegal strike and was the largest negotiated wage increase to date in the Public Service. It was not ratified by the membership and is now awaiting a <b>binding</b> arbitration <b>award.</b> CAUSES OF DISSATISFACTIONHowever, it would be unfair and unwise to attribute the present unrest entirely to forces in the immediate environment. The tensions have been building for a decade and are rooted in an increasingly articulated position that wage earners on the lower end of the totem pole are not sharing in Canada's growth and prosperity. The greatest challenge of collective bargaining in the next few years — in both the public and private sectors - will be how to improve the relative position of workers in this country who have failed to secure a fair share of the fruits of our nation's economic growth and development. For the private sector these are the unorganized employees who work at or near the legal minimum wage - and sometimes for substantially less than they are supposed to be guaranteed by law. It is a sad reflection on the otherwise substantial achievements of organized labour in this country that nearly a century after the first employees were organized in Canada, and 35 years after the law provided protection to employees against the use of strong-arm employer methods to restrict the encroachment of the unions, more than two-thirds of Canada's work force remains unorganized. In the municipalities and provincial institutions a great deal of progress has been made in the past decade, although there is room for improvement in both the form and substance of collective bargaining in many provincial civil services. In the Public Service of Canada, the challenge to the unions is not to increase our coverage, which is within a few percentage points of total, or to secure the right to bargain - a right we secured in 1967 - but to raise the incomes of those who are struggling to survive at the bottom of the heap. There is little doubt that rampant inflation has increased our sensitivity to the plight of our lower-paid members and the problems they face in trying to make ends meet on poverty-line incomes. Perhaps, in our anxiety to assure public servants wages comparable to those paid in the private sector, we hâve been a party to wage settlements for low wage earners which, although statistically defensible, were morally outrageous. The « percentage increase » syndrome which has permeated the collective bargaining scène in Canada for the past decade, provides for wage increases which purport to maintain relationships between workers at various income levels, but in fa. ct cons-titutes a statistical camouflage for increasing distortion of the relative affluence of those in high income brackets and the relative deprivation of those in the lower brackets. Percentage wage increases do not reveal the extent of improvement or lack of improvement in purchasing power of those who receive the increase, as anyone whose income is nil can demonstrate. A ten percent increase in a nil income provides its beneficiary with no increase in purchasing power. Let us, for example, consider the position of three wage earners during the 60 's whose wages in 1960 were $ 3, 000, $ 18, 000 and $ 50, 000 respectively and who received annual increases of 5 %. Assuming a nil income tax for the low wage earner, an effective tax of 30 % for the middle wage earner and 40 % for the high wage earner, the increase in annual purchasing power at the end of the decade will be $ 1, 654. 00 for the low wage earner, $ 6, 947 for the middle wage earner and $ 16, 540 for the high wage earner. In 1960, the purchasing power of the high wage earner exceeded that of the low wage earner by $ 27, 000. In 1969 the purchasing power of the high wage earner exceeded that of the low wage earner by $ 41, 886. 00. The aggregate purchasing power of the low wage earner throughout the ten-year period was $ 37, 734. 00 of the middle wage earner was $ 158, 482 and of the high wage earner was $ 377, 337. 00 Most workers in North American society, including members of the Public Service Alliance, do not believe everyone should receive an identical wage. They believe there should be an appropriate differential in wages and salaries to reflect the different contributions made by different individuals and to provide incentivesfor people to acquire higher skills and education and accept broader and more demanding responsibilities. But I do not believe that they approve of the ever-widening arc between those at the lower end of the pay scale and those at the upper end, and the regressive distribution of national income which is the inevitable consequence of our present wage culture. This ever-widening gap is, I believe, the gravest issue confronting our society today. It says, very simply, that those who eat high on the hog will eat higher as time goes on, and that those who eat low on the hog will soon be surviving -if they survive at all - on the tail and the hocks. How long will the mass of low wage earners in this country acquiesce peacefully to this demonstrably discriminatory wage and salary culture ? How much can they take without revolt ?THE PUBLIC SERVICE ALLIANCE'S POSITIONThe Public Service Alliance is attempting to redress the worst effects of this regressive wage cycle in which we have been trapped since we were bargaining in 1967. Our concern for what has been happening is reflected in some of our recent settlements which have modified the standard percentage increase formula with larger increases for the lower grades, either in percentage terms or by coupling percentage increases with flat rate settlements. The recent $ 500. 00 across-the-board cost-of-living increase for employees in the Public Service was a modest step in the right direction and one which we shall endeavour to repeat in one form or another. Its impact in percentage terms - even before tax was 10 % for the $ 5, 000 wage earner and approximately 1 % for those at the top of the wage spectrum. However, neither the Treasury Board as the employer nor the unions with which the Board negotiates are free to opt out of|$|R
