5000|$|A {{more common}} {{approach}} is [...] "covered" [...] line wire. It {{is treated as}} <b>bare</b> <b>cable,</b> but often is safer for wildlife, as the insulation on the cables {{increases the likelihood of}} a large-wing-span raptor to survive a brush with the lines, and reduces the overall danger of the lines slightly. These types of lines are often seen in the eastern United States and in heavily wooded areas, where tree-line contact is likely. The only pitfall is cost, as insulated wire is often costlier than its bare counterpart. Many utility companies implement covered line wire as jumper material where the wires are often closer to each other on the pole, such as an underground riser/pothead, and on reclosers, cutouts and the like.|$|E
40|$|A {{racetrack}} magnet, using Nb{sub 3 }Sn superconducting cable reacted before winding, {{has been}} fabricated and tested at Fermilab. It {{consists of two}} flat racetrack coils, connected in a common-coil configuration, separated by a 5 mm thick fiberglass plate. Synthetic oil was used to prevent sintering of the strands during the heat treatment. The coils were wound and vacuum impregnated in the mechanical structure. The turn-to-turn insulation, consisting of Kapton{reg_sign}and pre-impregnated fiberglass tapes {{as wide as the}} cable, was wound together with the <b>bare</b> <b>cable</b> in order to form a continuous inter-turn spacer. The coils were instrumented with voltage taps, temperature sensors, spot heaters and quench heaters. The maximum current achieved was 12675 A which is 78 % of the short sample limit at 5. 1 K (minimum temperature in the coil during 75 A/s ramp). Measurement of the temperature margin revealed a low degradation in the innermost turns. Quench performances at different temperatures and ramp rate effects have been measured and are presented and discussed...|$|E

25|$|Work in September 2011 {{included}} {{the installation of}} the turning tracks for the travelers at the western deviation saddles. These tracks allowed the continuous motion of the traveler across the western end of the main span. By mid-October 2011, the traveler cables were installed. A temporary group of tower stay cables to the west, intended to resist the overturning forces imposed by the <b>bare</b> main <b>cable,</b> were also installed. Subsequently, the eastern deviation saddles were installed, preparing the bridge for cable placement.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{considers}} {{mechanical strength}} problems of wood pole electricity distribution overhead lines. The problem of supplying power economically is also discussed {{from the various}} aspects including comparison of different conductors for overhead lines (OHL). In the present work more detailed CAD models and finite elements as well as finite volume methods, realized in CAE software and vastly verified in engineering practice, are used to obtain more accurate results. Firstly, simulations of air flow in cases of different shape of forest cutouts are conducted to evaluate wind loads acting on OHL components {{as well as on}} conifer and foliage trees grown along OHL footpath. Thermo and ice loads of the conductors are also taken into account. Two conductor types are analyzed: <b>bare</b> <b>cables</b> consisting of stranded aluminium wires and reinforced aluminum cables with a steel core which are typically used in medium voltage OHL. To obtain results with the appropriate computer resources, the equivalent characteristics (elastic modulus, etc.) of wires are identified by conducting physical experiments on a testing machine as well as by solution of a nonlinear contact problem for conductor consisting of a steel core and stranding aluminum wires. Buckling analysis of different types of trees and OHL poles as well as frequency analysis are performed...|$|R

50|$|Track lighting, {{invented by}} Lightolier, was popular at one {{period of time}} because it was much easier to install than {{recessed}} lighting, and individual fixtures are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall. It has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks, which often look nothing like their predecessors {{because they do not}} have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have, and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves. A master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts, instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer. There are traditional spots and floods, as well as other small hanging fixtures. A modified version of this is cable lighting, where lights are hung from or clipped to <b>bare</b> metal <b>cables</b> under tension.|$|R
500|$|In June 2004, Bloc Party convened at Deltalab Studios in Copenhagen to make Silent Alarm with Paul Epworth. The {{band had}} already written demo songs to record, but Okereke {{has noted that}} [...] "it is a {{creative}} process {{and you have to}} let yourself be inspired while you're in the studio as well". The Deltalab set-up posed problems, because it included <b>bare</b> mains <b>cables</b> and dated, malfunctioning equipment from the 1960s and 1970s. Bloc Party took three sessions to get acquainted with Epworth's methodology. The producer has called the recording time a [...] "growing process" [...] because Okereke was not wholly comfortable singing in front of people, especially after tonsil problems. Although the band members had preliminary ideas about a track's rhythm, they did not know how songs were going to start or end. Okereke often asked Tong to play something on the drums, which inspired him to mould a track by adding guitar chords to the beat.|$|R

With <b>cables</b> where the current carrying conductors are of a large Cross Sectional Area (CSA) and current carrying capacity, the Protective Earth conductor may be found to be of a smaller CSA, with a lower continuous current carrying capacity.

40|$|Large {{amplitude}} forced vibrations of suspended cables {{exhibit a}} rich variety of nonlinear phenomena, as highlighted by various theoretical models and analytical or numerical treatments [1]. Moreover, depending on problem parameters, experimental investigations show {{the occurrence of}} also involved bifurcation scenarios to complex response, un-modeled in theoretical analyses, and provide hints about possible occurrence of low-dimensional chaos [2]. In this lecture, an experimental polymeric cable with attached distributed masses, hanging between two supports {{at the same level}} and having geometrical and mechanical properties in the neighborhood of first crossover in the spectrum of in-plane natural frequencies, is considered. It realizes a reliable model of <b>bare</b> sagged <b>cable.</b> The system is in conditions of multiple internal resonance involving either all first four in-plane and out-of-plane, symmetric and anti-symmetric, modes (2 : 2 : 1 : 2) or only three of them (2 : 2 : 1, first in-plane and out-of-plane anti-symmetric, first out-of-plane symmetric), and it undergoes in-phase or anti-phase vertical motions of the supports at either primary or order -subharmonic resonance of the higher frequency modes.

A theoretical model for propagation of elastic waves in electric power cables is presented. The power cables are represented as viscoelastic-layered cylindrical structures with a copper core and a dielectric cover. The model equations then have been applied and numerically resolved for this and other known structures such as solid and hollow cylinders. The results are compared with available data from other models. Several experimental measures were carried out and were compared with results from the numerical simulations. Experimental and simulated results showed a significant difference between elastic wave attenuation inside standard versus <b>bare,</b> low-voltage power <b>cables.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

The starting point for any end part design is the given 2 -D magnet cross-section. The cross-section used here is the one detailed in Fermilab Technical Note TD- 02 - 012 [1] and is also shown in Fermilab drawing number 5520 -MC- 411284 2. The drawings of the <b>bare</b> and insulated <b>cable</b> for this cross-section are numbered 5520 -MC- 411285 and 5520 -MC- 411286 respectively. Fermilab drawings 5520 -MC- 411370 [1] and 5520 -MC- 411371 show the coil assembly for the inner and outer layers of the given cross-section.

40|$|Aeolian {{vibration}} in <b>bare</b> and iced <b>cable</b> was simulated {{using the}} theory of cable vibration. High frequency vibration creates stresses in the cable and consequently in the ice covering that cable, which may result in ice failure and eventually ice shedding. These stresses were estimated in this study. Displacement of the cable during vibration was determined; furthermore, instantaneous wind loads in vertical and transverse directions, additional stresses induced by the motion in the cable and in the atmospheric ice, as well as torque due to cable springback were calculated. In order to simulate the loading conditions of a chunk of atmospheric ice {{in the middle of}} a span, a new model was developed using ABAQUS. Results from this model show in spite of high frequency vibration, the resulting level of stress in atmospheric ice is far less than its failure limit. In other words, the atmospheric ice under the condition assumed in this investigation does not shed due to aeolian vibration...|$|R
40|$|Partial Discharge (PD) is a {{major problem}} in aging {{electrical}} power systems. PD causes damage to electrical hardware, power losses, and issues with power quality. It also creates electromagnetic (EM) interference that may couple into communication systems. PD activity can be an indicator of impending power line insulator failures, leading to catastrophic events such as pole top fires, bush fires and power outages, potentially costing millions of dollars and put the safety of people at risk. Therefore prevention, detection and eradication of PD are hence vital. Real time monitoring of overhead power lines for the EM radiation signatures emitted by PD can be employed for this purpose. The four main types of PD are investigated in this thesis: cavity discharge, corona discharge, dry-band arc discharge, and surface discharge. EM radiation due to cavity discharges has been examined with respect to {{an increase in the number}} of cavities in defective Perspex and Epoxy insulator samples. Cavity discharges in Perspex exhibit EM radiation significantly above the noise level in the 10 – 170 MHz and 760 – 1120 MHz bands, whilst the similar activity has been shown in 30 – 140 MHz and 840 – 1120 MHz bands for Epoxy nano-composite insulators. The EM radiation characteristics of corona discharge between water droplets and the dry-band arc discharge have also been investigated. An electromagnetic identification of the transition from corona to dry-band arc discharge has been discovered. The transition from corona discharge to dry-band arc discharge can be identified via EM sensing in the 800 – 900 MHz and 1. 25 – 1. 4 GHz bands. Investigations have shown it is notionally possible to monitor the degradation of the insulation surface by sensing the reduction of the voltage spectral density due to dry-band arc discharges in the 800 – 900 MHz band. An EM detection mechanism to monitor the variation of contamination level of a polluted insulator is proposed. By studying the EM radiation spectrum of surface discharge/creeping discharge activity, variations in salt concentration of a pollution layer on nano-composite epoxy insulator samples can be electromagnetically monitored in part or all of the 520 – 600 MHz, 700 – 740 MHz, 860 – 890 MHz, 1. 09 – 1. 11 GHz and 1. 53 – 1. 57 GHz frequency bands. A link between the pollutant salt concentration, breakdown voltage, surface conductance and the magnitude of the electromagnetic radiation has been identified. The propagation and radiation characteristics of the UHF frequency components of a PD signal along an uninsulated Aluminium power lines have been numerically evaluated. <b>Bare</b> Aluminium overhead <b>cables</b> show very low attenuation levels, even at GHz frequencies. Hence high frequency components of a PD signal will travel for a significant distance along a cable, allowing for remote real-time detection. The radiation patterns for the high frequency components of PD propagating on single wire and three phase systems exhibit travelling wave radiation patterns. An initial practical methodology and demonstration of PD detection and localisation was implemented on live power distribution lines. The results and findings gathered from field trials conducted with a pilot PD detection and localisation system have demonstrated the success of the PD monitoring system in identifying faults on power lines...|$|R
