5|$|Clues from Mollaka {{point to}} corrupt Greek {{official}} Alex Dimitrios. Bond finds Dimitrios in the Bahamas and, after seducing his wife Solange, pursues him to Miami. Bond kills Dimitrios and follows his henchman to the airport. He thwarts {{the destruction of}} Skyfleet's airliner, costing Le Chiffre his investment. To recoup the money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes Texas hold 'em tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the British government, which they will grant in exchange for information on his clients. On the train to Montenegro, Bond meets Vesper Lynd, a British Treasury agent there to protect the government's $10million <b>buy-in.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the debacles of the Schwarz era {{and brief}} {{control of the}} team by the CFL (see above) the Argos were rescued by David Cynamon and Howard Sokolowski in 2004. There was {{optimism}} surrounding the duo's arrival and attendance figures improved in their six years heading the organization. It was also appreciated that the two were Torontonians after a quarter-century of foreign and/or corporate ownership. But by 2010 losses were great enough that the team was again put on the block and eventually sold to David Braley. There was some controversy surrounding Braley's takeover. He is simultaneously owner of the BC Lions, raising questions of competitive integrity. It was also revealed that Braley had bankrolled half of Cynamon and Sokolowski's initial $2 million <b>buy-in</b> of the Argos in 2004, and covered half their subsequent losses, in exchange for half of the 2007 Grey Cup profits.|$|E

50|$|The {{prizes for}} winning are usually {{derived from the}} <b>buy-ins,</b> though outside funds may be entered as well. For example, some {{invitational}} tournaments do not have <b>buy-ins</b> and fund their prize pools with sponsorship revenue and/or gate receipts from spectators. (These tournaments {{are referred to as}} freerolls.) Play continues, in most tournaments, until all but one player is eliminated, though in some tournament situations, especially informal ones, players have the option of ending by consensus.|$|R

25|$|If {{a person}} is using this model as a scam, the {{confidence}} trickster would take {{the majority of the}} money. They would do this by filling in the first three tiers (with one, two, and four people) with phony names, ensuring they get the first seven payouts, at eight times the <b>buy-in</b> sum, without paying a single penny themselves. So if the <b>buy-in</b> were $5,000, they would receive $40,000, paid for by the first eight investors. They would continue to buy in underneath the real investors, and promote and prolong the scheme {{for as long as possible}} to allow them to skim even more from it before it collapses.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{earning the}} nickname, Ulliott had been {{referred}} to as Dave the Clock because he used a grandfather clock as a <b>buy-in</b> to a local game where he knew a furniture dealer was playing.|$|E

25|$|With {{a number}} of other poker events adding tournaments with buy-ins {{comparable}} to that of the $100,000 Challenge, the Aussie Millions added a tournament with a $250,000 <b>buy-in</b> in 2011, which the organisers again claimed as the world's highest. (Since then, the World Series of Poker has held an official event with a US$1 million <b>buy-in.)</b> It was originally scheduled to be a heads-up no-limit event, but the organisers changed the format twice, settling on what they thought would be a single-table no-limit hold 'em tournament. However, 20 players entered the inaugural $250K tournament, including major stars Phil Ivey, Erik Seidel, Tom Dwan, Chris Ferguson, John Juanda, David Benyamine and Annette Obrestad, plus Sam Trickett, who had just won that year's $100K event. Seidel, who had finished second in the $100K event, won the $2.5 million first prize, defeating Trickett in heads-up play.|$|E
25|$|Boyd has {{won three}} WSOP bracelets in his career.

He won his second in 2010 in a $2,500 Limit Hold'em/Six Handed event, and his third in 2014 in a $1,000 No-Limit Hold'em event.|$|E
25|$|The term LBO {{is usually}} {{employed}} when a financial sponsor acquires a company. However, many corporate transactions are partially funded by bank debt, thus effectively also representing an LBO. LBOs can have many different forms such as management buyout (MBO), management <b>buy-in</b> (MBI), secondary buyout and tertiary buyout, among others, and {{can occur in}} growth situations, restructuring situations, and insolvencies. LBOs mostly occur in private companies, but can also be employed with public companies (in a so-called PtP transaction – Public to Private).|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Rousso {{spoke in}} favor of changes to Florida {{gambling}} laws that would remove caps on <b>buy-ins</b> and wagers on poker in the state. She felt the gambling limitations precluded more strategic skilled deeper stack competition and said that Florida gamblers [...] "don't have enough chips {{in front of them}} to play out the bets and raises that are required in the skillful aspect of the game". [...] In 2007, a $100 cap replaced a $2/bet limit. This cap still prohibits large tournaments with multi-thousand dollar <b>buy-ins</b> from occurring in Florida.|$|R
50|$|There were 57 events, {{two more}} than in 2008. The main event had 6,494 <b>buy-ins,</b> 350 fewer than the {{previous}} year. Other changes for 2009 include the elimination of rebuy events {{and the introduction of}} triple starting chips.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{the office of}} New York City Mayor John Lindsay experimented with {{limiting}} and banning private cars in downtown Manhattan following federal pressure to improve city air quality. His original proposal, to ban noncommercial midday traffic in the financial district, {{was reduced to a}} parking ban at the request of business executives. The parking ban, announced in September 1970, affected a triangular 50-block area below Fulton Street and upset truckers and merchants. A later transportation commissioner said that the plans were fashionable and unfeasible due to unexamined commerce relationships and lack of preemptive <b>buy-in</b> from merchants. Lindsay's future proposals were restricted in scale.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 2011, the World Series of Poker and Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberté {{announced}} plans for an officially sanctioned special fundraising event, known as The Big One for One Drop, starting on July 1, 2012 with a record US$1 million entry fee. 11% of the money (more precisely, $111,111 from each <b>buy-in)</b> went to Laliberté's charity, the One Drop Foundation, and the WSOP waived its normal 10% rake of the entry fees. At {{the time of the}} original announcement, 15 of the maximum 48 seats had been taken. By early December 2011, the field size had increased to 22, the minimum required for an official bracelet tournament. Among those who committed early to the event were Johnny Chan, Daniel Negreanu, Jonathan Duhamel, Tom Dwan, Laliberté, billionaire businessman Phil Ruffin and Erik Seidel. On April 12, 2012, the WSOP announced that 30 players had committed to the tournament, which brought the first prize to $12.3 million, exceeding the record amount won by Jamie Gold. In the end, all 48 seats were filled, resulting in a first prize of $18.3 million. Poker professional Antonio Esfandiari won the event, also receiving a special platinum WSOP bracelet.|$|E
500|$|A poker player {{since the}} age of five, Rousso began serious poker tournament play during her summer break from law school. [...] Rousso was in the top 5% of her law school class, but she did not finish law school. [...] Now, {{excluding}} online winnings, she ranks among the top five women in poker history in terms of all-time money winnings. [...] She currently resides part-time in Las Vegas, Nevada and part-time in Hobe Sound, Florida. Her nickname was given to her by a relative when she sold shares of herself to enter a $25,000 <b>buy-in</b> event in a manner reminiscent of the eponymous hero of the 1994 Western movie Maverick.|$|E
25|$|The WSOPE {{moved from}} London to Cannes, France in 2011. At that time, the <b>buy-ins</b> and payouts changed from being fixed in pounds to euros. The event moved again in 2013, {{this time to}} the Paris suburb of Enghien-les-Bains.|$|R
5000|$|Pensioner <b>buy-ins</b> are an {{alternative}} to pension buy-outs where the financial contract is retained within the pension fund {{for the benefit of}} all members not just those members whose benefits are covered by the contract. Pensioner <b>buy-ins</b> are particularly popular in the United Kingdom as they benefit from more favorable accounting treatment and require a lower cash injection from the sponsor. [...] As of 2014, insurers involved in the market in the United Kingdom include Aviva, Legal & General, Pension Corporation, Prudential and Rothesay Life, while notable sponsors who have recently sought to offload their risk include Verizon and General Motors in the United States and Akzo Nobel and Total in the United Kingdom.|$|R

Nancy Todd finished first in the Ladies Championship with Vanessa Selbst finishing second. There are currently no WPT Ladies events scheduled.|$|R
500|$|Starting in 2012, {{qualification}} for the Circuit National Championship {{was significantly}} changed. A total of 100 players now receive automatic {{seats in the}} National Championship. The winners of each Circuit main event and the highest point earner at each circuit stop receive seats, with the remaining automatic seats filled by the top points earners throughout the Circuit season who are not already qualified. Additionally, the top 100 players in the [...] "WSOP World Rankings", a points race determined on results in open events of the previous two WSOPs, are eligible to enter. The Circuit qualifiers play the National Championship on a freeroll, while the WSOP World Rankings qualifiers must pay a $10,000 <b>buy-in.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} is {{the list of}} World Series of Poker Main Event champions. The World Series of Poker (WSOP) is [...] "the oldest, largest, most prestigious, and most media-hyped gaming competition in the world". [...] It is held annually since 1970 in Las Vegas. [...] Since 1972, the Main Event of the WSOP has been the $10,000 <b>buy-in</b> no-limit Texas Hold 'Em tournament. The winner of the WSOP Main Event receives a World Series of Poker bracelet, millions of dollars (with the exact amount {{based on the number}} of entrants), and the right to be considered the year's World Champion of Poker. [...] Since 2008, the nine players who make it to the final table of the Main Event are called the November Nine, a reference to the fact that the final table competes in November, months after the Main Event's preliminary rounds are completed.|$|E
500|$|The World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is {{the first}} {{expansion}} effort of World Series of Poker-branded poker tournaments outside the United States. Since 1970, the bracelet events have occurred every year in Las Vegas. [...] The inaugural WSOPE, held in 2007, {{marked the first time}} that a WSOP bracelet was awarded outside Las Vegas. [...] The 2007 Main Event, a GBP 10,000 <b>buy-in</b> no-limit hold 'em tournament, was won by Norwegian player Annette Obrestad on the day before her 19th birthday. This made her the youngest person to win a WSOP bracelet, a record that cannot be broken in the Las Vegas WSOP under current laws because the minimum legal age for casino gaming in Nevada is 21. Obrestad could play in the WSOPE because the minimum age for casino gaming in the United Kingdom is 18. [...] The World Series of Poker Europe has a unique identity from the Las Vegas WSOP, but according to Harrah's will remain true to the traditions and heritage. The 2011 WSOP Europe main event was an 8-handed event.|$|E
5000|$|Worldwide Brands Inc also {{coined the}} Term [...] "Light Bulk Wholesale" [...] in 2005, which means {{wholesale}} orders of $500.00 {{or less to}} make minimum orders affordable for small online retailers. Worldwide Brands continues to this day, convincing large volume wholesale suppliers to lower their minimums for small business <b>buy-ins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Big {{bets are}} used in Omaha poker to allow <b>buy-ins</b> of players at any time. In Omaha Eight-or-Better has a greater odds of winning and {{therefore}} less motivation to fold with a tentative hand. For that reason Omaha Eight-or-Better is sometimes played in a pot limit betting structure instead of big bets.|$|R
50|$|One of {{its most}} notable aspects was the new tax regime based on the profit {{rather than on the}} turnover. A flat rate of 20% was to be applied to all newly legalized games except the video lottery games. Operators {{organizing}} sports and horse betting, lotteries and skill games still had to pay 3% of total tournament <b>buy-ins</b> sold.|$|R
