40|$|Abstract: Dynamic {{pressure}} {{oil film}} bearing {{is an important}} mechanical component of the ship. With the development of large-sized ships, their dynamic pressure oil films often run at high speed and under heavy load generating high oil film pressure. In addition, due to {{the increased use of}} thin walled <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> with materials of low elastic modulus, the elastic deformation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> which is in dynamic pressure oil film bearing cannot be ignored. During computation, if the effect of elastic deformation on the performance of dynamic pressure oil film bearing is ignored as is usually the practise, the difference between the theoretical and the actual results will be enormous. Therefore, this article took the effect of <b>bearing</b> <b>shell's</b> elastic deformation on bearing performance as the research target. A coupling algorithm program in Matlab is written to simulate and solve the oil film bearing dynamic pressure lubrication theory, considering elastic deformation of <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> {{in a way that is}} more aligned with the actual working conditions. Conducted a comparison between the above results and the results with no consideration of elastic deformation and analyzed the process and regularity of the effect of elastic deformation and other factors on the performance of oil film <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> in operation under dynamic lubrication. Therefore more accurate theoretical basis can be provided for the design and fault diagnose of dynamic pressure oil film bearing of the ships...|$|R

40|$|Bearings today {{need to be}} able to run at {{very high}} speed, {{providing}} high positional accuracy for the structure that it supports, and requiring very little or no maintenance. For this to happen, bearings must have tight tolerances and very low or zero friction during operation. This pushes many traditional contact-type bearings to their limits as they often fail due to friction, generating heat and causing wear. By comparison, existing non-contact bearings fare better because of their very low or zero friction. But some have their own problem too. For example, the fact that aerostatic bearings require an air supply means having to use a separate air compressor and connecting hoses. This makes the installation bulky. Aerodynamic and hydrodynamic bearings cannot support loads at zero speed. Both hydrodynamic and hydrostatic bearings may cause contamination to the work-pieces and the work environment because of the use of lubricating fluid. A potential solution to the above-mentioned problems is the new squeeze film air bearing. It works on the rapid squeeze action of an air film to produce separation between two metal surfaces. This has the benefit of being compact with a very simple configuration because it does not require an external pressurized air supply, can support loads at zero speed and is free of contamination. For this research, two squeeze film air journal bearings, made from material of Al 2024 - T 3 and Cu - C 101 with the same geometry, were designed. The bearing is in the shape of a round tube with three fins on the outer surface and the journal, a round rod. When excited at a certain normal mode, the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> flexes with a desirable modal shape for the squeeze film action. The various modes of vibration of Al bearing were obtained from a finite-element model implemented in ANSYS. Two Modes, the 13 th and 23 rd, at the respective frequencies of 16. 320 kHz and 25. 322 kHz, were identified for further investigation by experiments with respect to the squeeze film thickness and its load-carrying capacity. For Cu bearing, the two Modes are also 13 th and 23 rd at the respective frequencies of 12. 184 kHz and 18. 459 kHz. In order to produce dynamic deformation of the bearings at their modes, a single layer piezoelectric actuator was used as a driver. The maximum stroke length and the maximum blocking force of the single layer piezoelectric actuator were determined using manual calculation and ANSYS simulation. In the coupled-field analysis, the single layer piezoelectric actuator was mounted on the outside surface of the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> and loaded with an AC and a DC voltage in order to produce the static and dynamic deformation. For the static analysis, the maximum deformation of Al <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> is 0. 124 μm when the actuators are driven at the DC of 75 V. For the dynamic analysis, the actuators are driven at three levels of AC, namely 55, 65 and 75 V with a constant DC offset of 75 V and the driving frequency coincided with the modal frequency of the bearing. The maximum dynamic deformation of Al <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> is 3. 22 μm at Mode 13 and 2. 08 μm at Mode 23 when the actuators were driven at the AC of 75 V and the DC of 75 V. Similarly, the FEA simulation was used for analyzing Cu bearing. Furthermore, the dynamic deformation of both Al and Cu bearing at Mode 13 and 23 are validated by experiments. This research developed two theoretical models that explain the existence of a net pressure in a squeeze film for the levitation. The first model uses the ideal gas law as first approximation whilst the second uses the CFX simulation to provide a more exact explanation. In terms of the load-carrying capacity, Mode 13 was identified to be better than Mode 23 for both bearings. However, at Mode 13, Al bearing has a higher load-carrying capacity than Cu bearing. This is due to Al bearing having a higher modal frequency and amplitude. Finally, the coupled-field analysis for fluid solid interaction (FSI) was studied at both Mode 13 and 23 for Al bearing. The findings are that: a) the fluid force in the squeeze film can affect the dynamic deformation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell,</b> especially at high oscillation frequency, more at Mode 13 than at Mode 23 due to the relatively high pressure end-leakage in the latter; b) the dynamic deformation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> increases with the gap clearance in a logarithmic manner at Mode 13; and c) the micron levels of gap clearance provide a damping effect on the dynamic deformation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> at Mode 13 and at Mode 23, though much less dominant.

40|$|Hydrodynamic flexure pivot {{tilting pad}} gas {{bearings}} (FPTPGBs) can enable successful operation of oil-free microturbomachinery. This work presents the experimental and analytical study of such bearings with different damper configurations. A test rig was constructed that could safely operate a ~ 28. 6 mm, 0. 8 kg rotor beyond 120 krpm. A time domain orbit simulation, which integrates nonlinear {{equations of motion}} for the rotor-bearing elements, was implemented as the primary analysis tool to predict rotor-bearing responses to imbalance, the presence and location of critical speeds, etc. Complementary analyses were also performed with a model that uses linear bearing impedance coefficients to predict system natural frequencies. Imbalance response testing verified that the rotor-bearing system behaved linearly in the region above the critical speed, and orbit simulations predicted the response to a calibrated imbalance with notable agreement. Viscoelastic dampers added behind the FPTPGB pads delayed the onset of subsynchronous vibrations (from 43 krpm without damper to above 50 krpm with damper) of the system with bearing clearance increased by shims. Midrange subsynchronous vibrations initiated at ~ 20 krpm were eventually suppressed by ~ 25 krpm due to the stabilizing effect of rotor centrifugal growth. The viscoelastic dampers had a negligible effect on suppressing these midrange subsynchronous vibrations in experiments, {{but this was not}} demonstrated in simulations, presumably due to much lower stiffness contribution of the damper at lower frequencies. The ideal, perfectly aligned models in the simulations were able to tolerate shims up to only 10 % of nominal clearance, but the test rig exhibited surprising stability with shims as much as 200 % of nominal clearance; this increase may be caused by imposed eccentricities due to misalignments in the test rig. FPTPGBs supported by compliant bump foils can have the ability to tolerate rotor misalignments and shock loading like foil gas bearings. Simulation studies on imbalance response characteristics for several <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> mass and support stiffness configurations present initial design guidelines for the application.

In normal operating conditions, the journal and <b>bearing</b> <b>shell</b> are separated by the oil film, which contributes to the reduction of wear. And the stability and reliability of oil film has a great effect on load capacity. The paper briefly introduces research methods of the load capacity of oil-film bearings and points out some aspects of large oil-film bearings for in-depth study. Then combining dynamic simulation with experimental test on the scaled model of whole machine, a dynamic research idea is presented for large oil-film bearings...|$|R
