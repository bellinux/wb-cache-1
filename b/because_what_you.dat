2500|$|Blacks in Dallas County and the Black Belt mourned {{the death}} of Reeb, as they had earlier mourned {{the death of}} Jimmie Lee Jackson. But many activists were bitter that the media and {{national}} political leaders expressed great concern over the murder of Reeb, a northern white in Selma, but had paid scant attention to that of Jackson, a local African American. SNCC organizer Stokely Carmichael argued that [...] "the movement itself is playing {{into the hands of}} racism, <b>because</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want as a nation is to be upset when anybody is killed [...] for it to be recognized, a white person must be killed -Well, what are you saying?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Of general precepts {{he never}} tired; one series of them {{followed}} another. To us {{many of them}} may seem commonplace; but we should reflect that the election of representatives was an amazing novelty in France, and Condorcet knew men well enough {{to be aware of}} the hazards of political inexperience. Beware of choosing a clever knave, he said, because he will follow his own interest and not yours; but at the same time beware of choosing a man for no better reason than that he is honest, because you need ability quite as much as you need probity. Do not choose a man who has ever taken sides against the liberty of any portion of mankind; nor one whose principles were never known until he found out that he wanted your votes. Be careful not to mistake heat of head for heat of soul; <b>because</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want is not heat but force, not violence but steadfastness. Be careful, too, to separate a man's actions from the accidents of his life; for one may be the enemy or the victim of a tyrant without being the friend of liberty. Do not be carried away by a candidate's solicitations; but at the same time, make allowance for the existing effervescence of spirits. Prefer those who have decided opinions to those who are always inventing plans of conciliation; those who are zealous for the rights of man to those who only profess pity for the misfortunes of the people; those who speak of justice and reason, to those who speak of political interests and of the prosperity of commerce. Distrust those who appeal to sentiment in matters that can be decided by reason; prefer light to eloquence; and pass over those who declare themselves ready to die for liberty, in favour of those who know in what liberty consists.[22] ...|$|E

6000|$|Oh, my dear friends, {{have not}} {{some of you}} {{sometimes}} had such thoughts? Then hear {{the word of the}} Lord to you: [...] "When--whensoever-- whensoever the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness which he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive." [...] "Have I any pleasure in the death of him that dieth? saith the Lord, and not rather that he should be converted, and live?" [...] True, most true, that the Lord is unchangeable: but it is in love and mercy. True, that God's will and law cannot alter: but what is God's will and law? The soul that sinneth, it shall die? Yes. But also, the soul that turneth away from its sin, it shall live. Never believe the devil when he tells you that God hates you. Never believe him when he tells you that God has been too hard on you, and put you into such temptation, or ignorance, or poverty, or anything else, that you cannot mend. No. That font there will give the devil the lie. That font says: [...] "Be you poor, tempted, ignorant, stupid, be you what you will, you are God's child--your Father's love is over you, His mercy is ready for you." [...] You feel too weak to change; ask God's Spirit, and He will give you a strength of mind you never felt before. You feel too proud to change; ask God's Spirit, and He will humble your proud heart, and soften your hard heart; and you will find to your surprise, that when your pride is gone, when you are utterly ashamed of yourself, and see your sins in their true blackness, and feel not worthy to look up to God, that then, instead of pride, will come a nobler, holier, manlier feeling--self-respect, and a clear conscience, and the thought that, weak and sinful as you are, you are in the right way; that God, and the angels of God, are smiling on you; that you are in tune again with all heaven and earth, because you are what God wills you to be--not His proud, peevish, self-willed child, fancying yourself strong enough to go alone, when in reality you are the slave of your own passions and appetites, and the plaything of the devil: but His loving, loyal son, strong in the strength which God gives you, and able to do what you will, <b>because</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will God wills also.|$|E
6000|$|There is no darker temptation {{than that}} which comes over a man when the devil whispers to him such {{thoughts}} as these, [...] "God does not care for me--God hates me. Luck, and everything else is against me. There seems some curse upon me. Why should I change? Let God first change to me and then will I change towards Him. But God will not change; He has determined to have no mercy on me. I can see that; for everything goes wrong with me. Then what {{is the use of}} my repenting. I will go my own way--and what must be must." [...] Have you ever had such thoughts? Then hear the word of the Lord to you: [...] "When, whensoever, wheresoever, the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness which he has committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. Have I any pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the Lord, and not rather that he should be converted and live?" [...] Never believe the devil when he tells you that God hates you. Never believe him when he tells you that God has been too hard upon you, and placed you in such circumstances of temptation, ignorance, poverty or anything else, that you cannot mend. What does the promise of your Baptism say? [...] "Be you poor, tempted, ignorant, stupid, be you what you will, you are God's child--your Father's love is over you, His mercy ready for you." [...] You feel too weak to change. Ask God's Spirit to give you a strength of will you never felt before. You feel too proud to change. Ask God's Spirit to humble your proud heart, to soften your hard heart; and you will find to your surprise that when your pride is gone, when you are utterly ashamed of yourself, and see your sins in their true blackness, and feel unworthy to look up to God, that then will come a nobler, holier, manlier feeling--self-respect, and a clear conscience, and the thought that, weak and simple as you are, you are in the right way; that God and the Angels of God are smiling on you; that you are in tune again with all earth and heaven, because you are what God wills you to be. Not His proud, peevish, self-willed child, fancying yourself strong enough to go alone, when you are really the slave of your own passions and appetites and the playthings of the devil; but His loving, loyal son through the strength of God, and able to do what you will, <b>because</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will God wills also.|$|E
