40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{heterocaryon}} formation between certain biochemical mutants of Neurospora crassa is controlled by a number of genes apart from the <b>biochemical</b> <b>mutant</b> genes concerned. Genetic control of heterocaryosis {{has been shown}} for several different combinations of mutants. A detailed investigation of the heterocaryon formed between a mutant requiring pantothenic acid and one requiring lysine has demonstrated four and possibly five genes to be concerned in the process of heterocaryon formation. These genes may not only prevent the formation of a heterocaryon but also modify the type of heterocaryotic growth. The characters so affected are the time at which heterocaryotic growth commences, the ability to maintain heterocaryotic growth and the vigor of the growth. The possible mode of action of such genes has been discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of mitochondria obtained from exponentially growing Neurospora can be varied by addition of choline or amino acids {{to the culture}} medium. The variation affects the phospholipid to protein ratio, and the density of mitochondria as determined by isopycnic centrifugation in sucrose gradients. These variations have been observed in <b>biochemical</b> <b>mutant</b> strains as well as wild type cultures. In a choline-requiring strain, two levels of choline supplementation to the medium have been defined: a low choline concentration just adequate to support maximal logarithmic growth, and a high choline concentration which permits maximal incorporation of radioactive choline into cellular lipids. Mitochondria isolated from cultures growing at the low choline concentration have one-half the phospholipid to protein ratio of those from high choline cultures, and their density is significantly higher. Artificial mixtures of {{the two types of}} mitochondria can be resolved into two populations by isopycnic centrifugation. The concentration of cytochromes (measured by mitochondrial difference spectra) and of malate and succinate dehydrogenases (measured by enzyme activity) were the same in both types of mitochondria, on a protein basis. The results suggest that during growth of the mitochondrial mass, the incorporation of phospholipid and protein components can vary independently. Direct kinetic measurements did indeed show that choline, added to a culture growing at low choline concentration, was incorporated into mitochondrial lipids at a rate faster than the incorporation of protein. The mitochondrial phospholipid to protein ratio can also be influenced by the level of leucine supplementation to a leucine-requiring mutant, so that with leucine concentrations above those required for maximal exponential growth, mitochondria of increasing density and decreasing phospholipid to protein ratio are produced. Additions of choline or amino acids to the minimal medium of wild type cultures influence mitochondrial composition in a manner directly comparable to that observed in <b>biochemical</b> <b>mutant</b> strains. The results suggest that mitochondrial composition, in general, is determined by rates of incorporation of the two major components, phospholipid and protein; that these rates can vary independently in response to precursor concentration in the culture medium; and that they normally operate at a precursor (substrate) concentration below saturation level...|$|E

40|$|The finding by Tatum, Banner, and Beadle (l), {{that the}} tryptophanless Neurospora mutant strain 10575 accumulates anthranilic acid, {{which in turn}} can be {{utilized}} for growth of strain 40008, has provided evidence that anthranilic acid is a biochemical precursor of tryptophan in this organism. It has been further established that indole is an intermediate in this conversion (2 - 5). More recent work {{with a number of}} mutants of Neurospora (6 - 8) has established that tryptophan is a biochemical precursor to niacin with kynurenine and hydroxyanthranilic acid as intermediates. The accumulated evidence has indicated the existence in the mold of the following series of reactions: → Anthranilic acid → indole → tryptophan → kynurenine → 3 -hydroxyanthranilic acid → nicotinic acid In the light of this evidence the present work was undertaken to trace the carbon in the carboxyl group of anthranilic acid in order to estimate its contribution as a structural unit in the formation of niacin and tryptophan. The organism chosen for this investigation was a <b>biochemical</b> <b>mutant</b> strain of Neurospora designated as strain 40008.

40|$|Constitutive {{centripetal}} {{transport of}} the actin-based cytoskeleton has been detected in cells spreading on a substrate, locomoting fibroblasts and keratocytes, and non-locomoting serum-deprived fibroblasts. These results suggest a gradient of actin assembly, {{highest in the}} cortex at the cytoplasm-membrane interface and lowest in the non-cortical perinuclear cytoplasm. We predicted that such a gradient would be maintained in part by phosphoinositide-regulated actin binding proteins because the intracellular free Ca 2 + and pH are low and spatially constant in serum-deprived cells. The cytoplasm-membrane interface presents one surface where the assembly of actin is differentially regulated relative to the non-cortical cytoplasm. Several models, based on in vitro biochemistry, propose that phosphoinositide-regulated actin binding proteins are involved in local actin assembly. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with {{an order of magnitude}} greater affinity (Kd = 3. 6 microM) than cys- 374 -labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I. Hence, we were able to directly compare the distribution and activity of a <b>biochemical</b> <b>mutant</b> of actin with an analog possessing closer to wild-type activity. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non- cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. Fluorescence ratio imaging revealed that serum- deprived and migrating fibroblasts concentrated the new actin analog into fibers up to four-fold in the periphery and leading edge of these cells, respectively, relative to a soluble fluorescent dextran volume marker, consistent with the formation of a gradient of actin filament density relative to cell volume. Comparison of these gradients in the same living cell using analogs of actin with high and low affinities for profilin demonstrated that increased profilin binding enhanced the gradient. Profilin and related proteins may therefore function in part to bias the assembly of actin at the membrane-cytoplasm interface...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to {{plant and animal}} cells, the fungal cells are multinucleate. A consequence of their multinucleate condition is heterokaryosis — the occurrence of genetically different nuclei in a common cytoplasm. In nature this condition occurs because of spontaneous mutations in the haploid nuclei in the coenocytic mycelium. Inspite of heterokaryosis being a fundamental aspect of fungal biology, the behaviour and dynamics of nuclei in fungal mycelium are little understood. This study was prompted by the following questions: (1) Why does a fungus need so many nuclei? (2) Are they all active simultaneously? (3) Does {{the proportion of the}} different nuclear types in fungal mycelium alter in response to change in conditions of growth? (4) Is the activity of an enzyme related to the dose of nuclei containing the encoding gene? Experimental approach. The approach taken was to generate heterokaryons in which one of the nuclear types carries a mutant allele for a specific enzyme while the other nuclear type carries the functional allele, introduced by transformation. Because in filamentous fungi, the transforming DNA commonly integrates randomly into the chromosomal DNA, the transformants would be genetic 'variants' in which the ratios of transformed to non-transformed nuclei might be controlled differently. The transformants could thus be useful in investigating the relationship between the frequency of transformed nuclei and the activity of encoded enzyme. In addition the transformants might be useful for studying nuclear behaviour. The availability of developmental information, genetic and molecular methodology, and <b>biochemical</b> <b>mutant</b> in Neurospora crassa made this fungus a material of choice for this investigation. Strain construction. A histidinol dehydrogenase (his- 3) mutant strain was used into which an albino colour marker and a biochemical marker, inositoL were introduced by crossing. The latter two markers served as check against possible laboratory contamination. In addition, a gene mem, was introduced into the strain. In the mem genetic background, the strain has a wild-type morphology on agar medium but when grown in liquid shake culture it produces uninucleate microconidia that are useful in estimating nuclear ratio. Protoplasts of a constructed strain (his- 3 al- 1; mem; inl) were transformed with a plasmid containing the wild-type his- 3 allele, thereby converting the original strain into a heterokaryotic strain having a mixture of transformed (his- 3 +t) and untransformed (his- 3) nuclei. [The superscript +/ is used here to denote an his~ 3 + allele ectopically introduced by transformation]. Integration of plasmid DNA sequence in three selected transformants, 2 T 5, 3 T 3 and 4 T 12, was confirmed by genomic Southern analysis using the vector DNA as probe. The exponential growth rate of all three transformants was similar (~ 0. 08 mgh" 1). Nuclear ratio. Assuming a uniform distribution of nuclei in mycelium, and a correspondence between nuclear ratio in mycelium and conidia, the ratio his- 3 * {: his- 3 was estimated by plating microconidia. In transformant 3 T 3, the nuclear ratio was 7 : 1. In 2 T 5, all nuclei were his- 3 n. Transformant 4 T 12 did not produce microconidia. The nuclear ratio in this transformant was therefore estimated by macroconidial plating and found to be 1 : 5, in favour of his- 3 nuclei. Behaviour of transformants in vegetative and sexual phase. Although the transformants had originally been selected for the expression of his- 3 +T gene, a majority of macroconidia produced in cultures of 3 T 3 and 2 T 5 required histidine to trigger their germination. This condition, referred to as cphenotypic lag', led to a gross underestimation of the proportion of prototrophic macroconidia by the direct plating method and biased the estimation of nuclear ratios. Therefore nuclear ratio was estimated by first germinating macroconidia on histidine supplemented medium before testing colonies in histidine dropout slants and comparing the numbers of auxotrophic and prototrophic mycelia. Phenotypic lag was not observed in 4 T 12. The variation in the degree of expression of phenotypic lag among the transformants was ascribed to transgene position effect. The transformants differed also in meiotic instability of the transforming DNA — the transforming DNA in 3 T 3 was passed through unchanged but it was deleted or modified in 4 T 12 and 2 T 5. Experimental alteration of nuclear ratio. The transformants differed with respect to the self-adjusted ratio of transformed to non-transformed nuclei and also to the degree to which their nuclear ratio could be altered by nutritional manipulation of the growth medium, i. e., by growing the transformants in {{the presence or absence of}} histidine in the medium. In 3 T 3, the proportion of his- 3 +t nuclei progressively decreased by 3. 5 -fold in the sixth subculture on histidine medium. The change in 4 T 12 was even more striking: in the sixth serial subculture, the proportion of his- 3 +t nuclei decreased from 17 - 20 % to - 0. 05 %. However, when it was propagated again in medium that lacked histidine, the frequency of his- 3 +t nuclei was immediately restored to original level (- 17 %). That drastic alterations in nuclear ratio occurred upon nutritional manipulation was verified by Southern analysis. The intensity of signal specific for transformed DNA (nuclei) in cultures grown without histidine supplement was strong, but barely detectable in cultures grown with histidine. The signal reappeared when 4 T 12 was propagated in medium lacking histidine. Histidine induced change in nuclear ratio in 4 T 12 was further confirmed by three tests: (i) inoculum test using conidia, (ii) hyphal tip analysis, and (iii) genetic test using colour markers. Nuclear ratio and enzyme activity. Because in 4 T 12 changes in nuclear ratio could be manipulated, this transformant was used to investigate whether the proportion of his- 3 +t nuclei is correlated with the levels of encoded enzyme, histidinol dehydrogenase. Surprisingly, the specific activity of histidinol dehydrogenase was the same regardless of the percentage of his- 3 +t nuclei. This observation suggested that the physiological demand of a metabolite may be satisfied with only a few nuclei carrying the relevant gene. Or in other words the majority of nuclei in the coenocytic mycelium may, perhaps, not be active simultaneously. Silencing of transforming DNA in nuclei. Two experiments were done to test the possibility that in a majority of nuclei, the transforming DNA is selectively silenced by methylation of cytosine: (1) Southern analysis of chromosomal DNA digested with isoschizomers, and (2) Reactivation by growth of transformants in presence of 5 -azacytidine, an inhibitor of methylation. The results suggested that a majority of transformed nuclei may, perhaps, be inactive. The results of Northern analysis suggested that the amount of his- 3 +t transcript was correlated (but 5 -azacytidine experiment indicated that only few his- 3 +t nuclei may be active) with the proportion of his- 3 +t nuclei, but not histidinol dehydrogenase activity. The above results suggested that expression of his- 3 +t gene was controlled both at the levels of transcription and posttranscription. Nuclear selection. To study competition between nuclei containing mutant (his- 3) nuclei and prototrophic nuclei containing his- 3 + gene at its normal chromosomal location or at the ectopic location, heterokaryons were synthesized using strains in which the nuclear types had been marked by non-allelic genetic colour markers, al- 1 and al- 2. The results suggested that in heteronuclear mixture, the replication rate of the transformed nuclei is affected as compared to the nuclei having the gene in normal chromosomal location. Major contributions. This study generated (his- 3 + his- 3 +) heterokaryons by transformation. The behaviour of transformants differed in some respects both in the vegetative and sexual phases. It was demonstrated that nuclear ratio could be experimentally altered. However, there was no correlation between nuclear ratio and enzyme activity. The observations imply asynchronous division rate among nuclei and raise the possibility that not all nuclei in the coenocytic mycelium are active simultaneously...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Genetic {{recombination}} {{has been}} shown to occur in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Crosses between 18 <b>biochemical</b> <b>mutants</b> of 4 strains were studied and, although non-random segregation was found for non-selective markers, it has not yet been possible to draw conclusions concerning gene order or linkage. The progeny obtained from crosses tended to resemble one parent more than the other. The 4 strains of P. aeruginosa used were interfertile in certain combinations but selfsterile. There was no evidence for an infectious principle affecting fertility but fertility changes may occur amongst recombinant progeny. Genetic studies in Escherichia coli have demonstrated a mechanisni of genetic exchange which until now has been unique among bacteria (see Lederberg et al., 1951; Hayes, 1953). Even within this species practically all of the work has been restricted to the K 12 strain.

40|$|The {{precursor}} {{relationship of}} cystathionine in the biosynthesis of methionine by Neurospora crassa was first indicated by Horowitz (1947). Isotope competition studies with N. crassa yielded {{evidence that the}} sulfur of cystathionine can supply {{a large portion of}} the sulfur needed for growth (Roberts et al., 1955). Isolation of the cystathionine-cleaving enzymes and their respec-tive reaction products from different N. crassa methionineless mutants further indicated the validity of the precursor role of cystathionine and supported the concept of transsulfuration in N. crassa (Fischer, 1957). Cystathionine has been designated as a bio-synthetic intermediate in methionine formation in both mammals and microorganisms. Evidence for and against its biological significance has been presented in the literature. The investigation reported here was initiated to evaluate the posi-tion of cystathionine in methionine biosynthesis by utilizing <b>biochemical</b> <b>mutants</b> of N. crassa, blocked in the pathway of methionine biosynthe-sis, in isotopic conversion studies. Primary objectives have been: (a) to determine the source of the carbon chains and sulfur of cystathionine and, (b) to find whether radioactive cystathionine contributes to the carbon chain or sulfur of methionine.

40|$|A {{variant of}} Neisseria meningitidis {{was found to}} carry a mutator factor which endowed the {{bacteria}} with generalized genetic instability. The reversion frequencies of several <b>biochemical</b> <b>mutants</b> were increased up to 1, 000 -fold when the factor was introduced. The factor is not unidirectional in preference, since the mutator induced mutants generally reverted with increased frequency in its presence. There could be found no indication of insufficient synthesis of nucleic acid precursors. Attempts to demonstrate an unusual, mutagenic base incorporated in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) were negative. Strains carrying the mutator factor had significantly increased sensitivity to ultraviolet light. A mutation to a more ultraviolet-resistant type coincided with a disappearance of the mutator property. The presence of the mutator factor in a competent strain resulted in a reduction of the transformation frequency to between 0. 5 and 5 % {{of that in the}} parental strain. A mutation to the more ultraviolet-resistant type resulted in simultaneous loss of the mutator property and reestablishment of a normal transformation efficiency. It has been suggested that this mutator factor may represent a defect in the DNA repair mechanism, which is also of importance for genetic recombination.

40|$|Among artificially {{produced}} <b>biochemical</b> <b>mutants</b> of Neurospora, {{those which}} {{have lost the}} ability to synthesize methionine form the largest class. At the present writing 87 occurrences of the methionineless character have been observed in this laboratory following treatment of wild type spores with high frequency radiations (1) or mustard gas (2). Methionineless mutants differ from wild type Neurospora in that they fail to grow on a medium containing only sugar, inorganic salts, and biotin, but do grow if, in addition to these constituents, methionine is supplied. In many of the mutants failure of methionine synthesis results from a block in the reduction of sulfate, which, except for a trace of biotin, is the sole source of sulfur in the basal medium. These strains can utilize reduced forms of inorganic sulfur for growth, as well as methionine and other organic sulfur compounds. On the other hand, some of the mutants require organically bound sulfur for growth, an indication that in these strains the block in methionine synthesis comes at a later stage than sulfate reduction.

Of 22 cell lines that were INH-resistant, none were different from wild-type cells in their ability to take up [3 H]INH or to oxidize INH to isonicotinic acid. In 7 of the 22 cell lines, INH resistance was associated with decreased inhibition of NAD-dependent glycine decarboxylation activity in isolated mitochondrial preparations. In the cell line that was most extensively investigated (I 24), this biochemical phenotype (exhibiting a 3 -fold higher Ki with INH) was observed in leaf mitochondria of regenerated plants and of plants produced from them by self-fertilization. After crosses between resistant and sensitive plants, the decreased inhibition of glycine decarboxylation was observed among F 2 and backcross progeny only in those plants previously identified as INH-resistant by callus growth tests. In contrast, in siblings identified as INH-sensitive, glycine decarboxylation was inhibited by INH at the wild-type level.

Spores in which mutation has been induced by ultraviolet light irradiation do not germinate as readily as the normal spores in a germination medium; therefore, mutant spores can be concentrated selectively by heat inactivation to kill most germinated prototrophs. Spore suspensions were irradiated with UV light at a distance of 40. 5 cm for three to four minutes which resulted in 99 percent kiII.

Indeed, this compound is a strong inhibitor of the cytochrome-P- 450 -obtusifoliol- 14 -demethylase in sterol biosynthesis.

The best selective conditions were first determined, i. e. strength of the selection pressure as well as the time and duration of its application in the developmental process from protoplast to whole plant. Selection experiments resulted in the recovery of 40 resistant calli. These calli were divided into three classes according to the modification of their sterol content in response to LAB 170250 F. Some of these calli might be impaired in sterol biosynthesis, but most have a sterol profile identical to that of the control calli.

The isolates varied significantly in their {{resistance to antibiotics}} and NaCl, their growth on different carbohydrates, and their effect on the pH of culture media. Most isolates showed intermediate antibiotic resistance, the capacity to use numerous carbohydrates, and a neutral to acid pH response. The mean generation time of these isolates ranged from 4. 813 to 6. 437 and 4. 600 to 6. 523 for Sesbania sesban and Leucaena leucocephala, respectively.

Such mutants are characterized by the inability to carry out specific chemical syntheses which normally occur in the unmutated, or wild type, strain. In each case which has been genetically analyzed {{the failure of the}} synthesis {{has been found to be}} related to the mutation of a single gene. The strain to be described, known as No. 34486, or cholineless, arose from a culture of wild type Neurospora crassa which had been irradiated with ultraviolet light. It was found to be unable to grow in a medium containing only salts, sugar, and biotin, but it grew normally on the addition of a mixture of water-soluble vitamins. When the components of the mixture were tested singly, it was found that the addition of choline alone permitted normal growth. Up to the present, no completely satisfactory method for the determination of choline in natural products and tissue extracts has been described. Chemical methods, such as precipitation of the reineckate, lack specificity, while the biological method of Fletcher, Best, and Solandt (3) is time-consuming and difficult, and “possesses many dangerous pitfalls for the chemist” (4). The whole subject has been critically reviewed by Best and Lucas (4). It was therefore of interest to determine whether the Neurospora mutant is a suitable test organism in a quantitative assay for choline. The experiments to be described show that this is the case and form the basis of a simple, sensitive, and specific method for the determination of choline in natural products.

It should be emphasized that, unlike other strains of Azotobacter (Eisenstark et al., 1950), variety A. agile M. B. 4. 4 does not go into an encysted stage. This strain is morphologically stable and rarely varies from the typical single and paired forms (figures 1 and 2) when grown on the usual laboratory nitrogen-free media. Even very old cultures contain only these regular cell types. However, when cells are transferred from a nitrogen-free medium to a medium containing beef extract or soil extract, giant cells develop in abundant numbers within 24 hours. Further study indicates that a few toxic substances may produce the same results. MATERIALS AND METHODS The organism {{used in this study}} was Azotobacter agile M. B. 4. 4, obtained from Professor C. B. van Niel. This organism has been used in research on <b>biochemical</b> <b>mutants</b> (Karlsson and Barker, 1948), and it was for this reason that its cytology was of interest to the present investigators. The basal medium used in this study contained only inorganic salts, glucose, agar, and distilled water (Karlsson and Barker, 1948). Standard nutrient agar and soil extract agar (Allen, 1949) were used to obtain the large forms. Cells were examined by standard procedures of phase microscopy, electron microscopy, and nuclear staining. In order to test for possible single nutritional substances that might stimulate the production of large forms, the following carbon compounds, amino acids, and accessory growth substances were added to the basal medium during {{the course of}} experiments: glycine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, KNO 3...|$|R
40|$|Studies on the {{distribution}} of Mucor ramannianus in coniferous woodland and heathland soils of a podsolic nature resulted in the amassing of a number of isolates. Macro and micro morphological observations on these isolates revealed that they could be placed in five distinct groups, A -E. A study of the growth reactions of the isolates under a number of different cultural conditions showed that they also differed physiologically. The isolates could be placed in the same five groups on physiological grounds, as well as on morphological grounds. A study of the growth factor requirements of the species revealed that some isolates were heterotrophic for thiamin, whilst others were autotrophic or incompletely autotrophic for this vitamin. One isolate required some other growth factor, but its exact requirement was not discovered. Variation within the species was thus shown to occur at morphological, physiological and biochemical levels, the last two being related to the morphology of the isolates. Crossing experiments between isolates of the same and different groups produced negative results, i. e. zygospores were not produced. A spontaneous imitation of an autotrophic isolate resulted in sectors which required thiamin for growth. These mutant sectors were exactly similar in morphology, physiology and biochemistry to the isolates of the heterotrophic group. Thus a connection between two of the groups was discovered. Following the observation of occasional hyphal fusion and anastomosis in this species, the possibility of heterokaryosis being a means of variation within the species was considered. Induced <b>biochemical</b> <b>mutants</b> were obtained by use of X-rays and ultra-violet light. Heterokaryons were produced between certain of these mutants and the spontaneous mutant. Investigations into {{the distribution}} of M. ramannianus have revealed that there is a relationship between the type of distribution shown by a particular isolate of the species and the group to which that isolate belongs. <p...|$|R

40|$|In Serratia marcescens, the {{tryptophan}} biosynthetic enzymes {{were formed}} coordinately. A number of tryptophan auxotrophs showed single <b>biochemical</b> lesions; several <b>mutants</b> showed pleiotropic effects. Sucrose {{density gradient centrifugation}} revealed an unique pattern of migration of the tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes. The repression response of the Serratia enzymes to exogenous tryptophan was fivefold more sensitive than that found in Escherichia coli. When this information is contrasted with the available information on the other Enterobacteriaceae, one is compelled to conclude that S. marcescens enjoys a rather marked evolutionary divergence from the other enteric organisms...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFunctional {{studies in}} Drosophila have been key for {{establishing}} {{a role for}} the septin family of proteins in animal cell division and thus extending {{for the first time}} observations from the budding yeast to animal cells. Visualizing the distribution of specific septins in different Drosophila tissues and, in particular, in the Drosophila embryo, together with <b>biochemical</b> and <b>mutant</b> phenotype data, has contributed important advances to our understanding of animal septin biology, suggesting roles in processes other than in cytokinesis. Septin localization using immunofluorescence assays has been possible due to the generation of antibodies against different Drosophila septins. The recent availability of lines expressing fluorescent protein fusions of specific septins further promises to facilitate studies on septin dynamics. Here, we provide protocols for preparing early Drosophila embryos to visualize septins using immunofluorescence assays and live fluorescence microscopy. The genetic tractability of the Drosophila embryo together with its amenability to high-resolution fluorescence microscopy promises to provide novel insights into animal septin structure and function...|$|R

(1) Mutants of E. coli K 12 deficient in the biosynthesis of cysteine were isolated.

40|$|Galactose {{metabolism}} in Lactobacillus casei 64 H {{was analyzed}} by genetic and <b>biochemical</b> methods. <b>Mutants</b> with defects in ptsH, galK, or the tagatose 6 -phosphate pathway were isolated either by positive selection using 2 -deoxyglucose or 2 -deoxygalactose or by an enrichment procedure with streptozotocin. ptsH mutations abolish growth on lactose, cellobiose, N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, fructose, mannitol, glucitol, and ribitol, while growth on galactose continues at a reduced rate. Growth on galactose is also reduced, but not abolished, in galK mutants. A mutation in galK {{in combination with}} a mutation in the tagatose 6 -phosphate pathway results in sensitivity to galactose and lactose, while a galK mutation in combination with a mutation in ptsH completely abolishes galactose metabolism. Transport assays, in vitro phosphorylation assays, and thin-layer chromatography of intermediates of galactose metabolism also indicate the functioning of a permease/Leloir pathway and a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) /tagatose 6 -phosphate pathway. The galactose-PTS is induced by growth on either galactose or lactose, but the induction kinetics for the two substrates are different...|$|R

Molecular modeling and <b>biochemical</b> assays of <b>mutant</b> proteins under elevated hydrostatic pressure suggest significantly reduced activity in G 278 R and a chelation of water molecules in D 490 G that locks the mutated enzyme in an inactive trans conformation in utero.

40|$|We used {{electron}} tomography {{to directly}} visualize trilobed presumptive envelope (env) glycoprotein structures {{on the surface}} of negatively stained HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) virions. Wild–type HIV- 1 and SIV virions had an average of 8 – 10 trimers per virion, consistent with predictions based on <b>biochemical</b> evidence. <b>Mutant</b> SIVs, biochemically demonstrated to contain high levels of the viral env proteins, averaged 70 – 79 trimers per virion in tomograms. These correlations strongly indicate that the visualized trimers represent env spikes. The env trimers were without obvious geometric distribution pattern or preferred rotational orientation. Combined with biochemical analysis of gag/env ratios in virions, these trimer counts allow calculation of the number of gag molecules per virion, yielding an average value of ≈ 1, 400. Virion and env dimensions were also determined. Image-averaging analysis of SIV env trimers revealed a distinct chirality and strong concordance with recent molecular models. The results directly demonstrate the presence of env trimers {{on the surface of}} AIDS virus virions, albeit at numbers much lower than generally appreciated, and have important implications for understanding virion formation, virus interactions with host cells, and virus neutralization...|$|R
40|$|RNA editing {{changes the}} coding/decoding {{information}} relayed by transcripts via nucleotide insertion, deletion, or conversion. Editing of tRNA anticodons by deamination of adenine to inosine is used both by eukaryotes and prokaryotes {{to expand the}} decoding capacity of individual tRNAs. This limits the number of tRNA species required for codon-anticodon recognition. We have identified the Arabidopsis thaliana gene that codes for tRNA adenosine deaminase arginine (TADA), a chloroplast tRNA editing protein specifically required for deamination of chloroplast (cp) -tRNAArg(ACG) to cp-tRNAArg(ICG). Land plant TADAs have a C-terminal domain similar in sequence and predicted structure to prokaryotic tRNA deaminases and also have very long N-terminal extensions of unknown origin and function. <b>Biochemical</b> and <b>mutant</b> complementation studies showed that the C-terminal domain is sufficient for cognate tRNA deamination both in vitro and in planta. Disruption of TADA has profound effects on chloroplast translation efficiency, leading to reduced yields of chloroplast-encoded proteins and impaired photosynthetic function. By contrast, chloroplast transcripts accumulate to levels significantly above those of wild-type plants. Nevertheless, absence of cp-tRNAArg(ICG) is compatible with plant survival, implying that {{two out of three}} CGN codon recognition occurs in chloroplasts, though this mechanism is less efficient than wobble pairing...|$|R
