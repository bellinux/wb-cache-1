40|$|This chapter will {{identify}} how Australian university students {{access and use}} various forms of technology (Web 1. 0 – Internet, Web 2. 0 – social media - SM) to retrieve personal health information. This chapter will move beyond Web 1. 0, to present a theoretical <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim,</b> concerning {{the extent to which}} other forms of technology (e. g. Web 2. 0 and wireless monitoring devices) have impacted on youth. What is more, attention will be directed towards outlining to what degree this has shaped their patterns of health information retrieval. Importantly, this chapter aligns with contemporary literature that suggests a need for further studies into the area of human - technology interactions, which promotes sustainable action plans and strategies that will create and encourage reform throughout e-health programs and interactive communication platforms. Given that Australian university students are prolific users of modern forms of communication technology and that youth, in general, characteristically undertake relatively high levels of risky health behaviours and unhealthy lifestyle choices, such a chapter would seem warranted.

40|$|The {{resurgence}} of bed bugs in major urban centres in North America {{has resulted in}} conflict between landlords and tenants. This is commonly focused on attribution of blame for source of infestation, on responsibility, on costs for preparation, treatment and losses, and for compensation as rent abatement and/or alternative temporary housing. In Ontario, Canada, these issues are often decided by adjudicators at the Landlord and Tenant Board hearing claims, counter-claims and defense by legal representation (lawyers and paralegals) {{as well as through}} mediation. Evidence in these hearings may include photographs, invoices for costs as well as testimony by tenants, landlords and “expert witnesses” who are most often pest control firms representing their landlord clients. A total of 44 Landlord and Tenant Board adjudicated cases available online were analyzed. The analysis included elements of the decisions such as adjudicator, claimant (landlord or tenant), <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim,</b> review of evidence, amount of claim, amount awarded, and evaluation {{of the quality of the}} evidence. The results of the analysis of these findings are discussed. Recommendations for improvement of adjudicator decisions on the basis of knowledge of bed bug biology and Integrated Pest Management best practices are presented as well as the importance of education of tenants and landlords to a process of mutual trust, support and accountability...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{analyses}} {{the paradox}} of continued promotion of drip irrigation through state subsidies and donor-funded projects, on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> water savings that are rarely backed up with evidence. Focusing on groundwater, two questions are proposed to unravel this double paradox: why is there increased pressure on groundwater resources despite the use of (purportedly) efficient drip irrigation? And why do actors continue to use the water saving argument for drip irrigation without ever measuring the claimed water conservation outcomes? These questions are illustrated through {{a case study in}} North Africa. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 40 - 43). Illness is {{an inevitable}} {{part of life}} and much uncertainty surrounds it. The patient-provider relationship is vital in working through these uncertainties pertaining to health. Physicians cannot and do not always account to greater knowledge during the interactional environment of the medical interview. Diagnosis and treatment plans are often the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> insufficient knowledge where physicians cannot account to greater knowledge. Thus rationales are established to support these <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> insufficient knowledge. Oncology medical interviews were examined {{through the use of}} conversation analysis. The goal of the present research is to understand the ways in which physicians claim insufficient knowledge in the medical interview. In addition, patients' responses to physicians' <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> insufficient knowledge is also analyzed...|$|R
