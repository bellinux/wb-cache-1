5|$|Where ν and Ediff are as {{described}} above, Γ is the jump or hopping rate, T is temperature, and kB is the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>constant.</b> Ediff must be {{smaller than the}} energy of desorption for diffusion to occur, otherwise desorption processes would dominate. Importantly, equation 1 tells us how very strongly the jump rate varies with temperature. The manner in which diffusion takes place {{is dependent on the}} relationship between Ediff and kBT as is given in the thermodynamic factor: when Ediff < kBT the thermodynamic factor approaches unity and Ediff ceases to be a meaningful barrier to diffusion. This case, known as mobile diffusion, is relatively uncommon and has only been observed in a few systems. For the phenomena described throughout this article, it is assumed that Ediff >> kBT and therefore Γ << ν. In the case of Fickian diffusion it is possible to extract both the ν and Ediff from an Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient, D, versus 1/T. For cases where more than one diffusion mechanism is present (see below), there may be more than one Ediff such that the relative distribution between the different processes would change with temperature.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} role of {{fundamental}} constants and measurement data for the Planck, Avogadro and <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>constants</b> and the elementary electric charge {{in connection with the}} planned transition to new definitions of four base SI units (the kilogram, mole, ampere and kelvin) in terms of fixed values of these constants. It is proposed to choose a new definition of any base SI unit in terms of a particular fundamental physical constant using a number of criteria, or principles, such as succession relative to the current SI, a sufficient stability of the new unit standards, and concordance between physical dimensions of the unit and the corresponding fundamental constant. It is argued that a redefinition of the kilogram and mole by fixing the values of the atomic mass unit and the Avogadro constant satisfies all these criteria and bears some more advantages against the version with fixed Planck constant: a well founded approach to definition of the ampere and the opportunity to preserve the current relationship between definitions of the mole and the kilogram.

The dimensionality effects of the blackbody radiation {{has been the subject of}} considerable research activity in recent years. These studies are still somewhat fragmentary, pos- ing formidable qualitative and quantitative problems for various scientific and technological areas. In this work we carry out an information-theoretical analysis of the spectral energy density of a d-dimensional blackbody at temperature T by means of various entropy-like quantities (disequilibrium, Shannon entropy, Fisher information) as well as by three (dimensionless) complexity measures (Crámer-Rao, Fisher-Shannon and LMC). All these frequency-functional quantities are calculated and discussed in terms of temperature and dimensionality. It is shown that all three measures of complexity have an universal character in the sense that they depend neither on temperature nor on the Planck and <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>constants,</b> but only on the the space dimensionality d. Moreover, they decrease when d is increasing; in particular, the values 2. 28415, 1. 90979 and 1. 17685 are found for the Crámer-Rao, Fisher-Shannon and LMC measures of complexity of the 3 -dimensional blackbody radiation, respectively. In addition, beyond the frequency at which the spectral density is maximum (which follows the well-known Wien displacement law), three further characteristic frequencies are defined in terms of the previous entropy quantities; they are shown to obey Wien-like laws. The potential usefulness of these distinctive features of the blackbody spectrum is physically discussed. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Lattice gauge theorists usually study what I am calling here "quantum" phase {{transitions}}, i. e. phase transitions {{driven by}} quantum, rather than thermal, fluctuations. In condensed matter physics, though, such transitions have received less attention {{than the more}} conventional "thermal " phase transitions where one goes through the transition by varying the temperature. However, there has recently been an upsurge of interest in quantum phase transitions in the condensed matter community, partly because there are experimental systems, and partly because, {{in the presence of}} quenched disorder, such transitions exhibit new physics which is rather poorly understood. Let us first discuss why one can generally set h = 0 in treatments of phase transitions in condensed matter physics.

25|$|The equipartition theorem makes {{quantitative}} predictions. Like the virial theorem, {{it gives}} the total average kinetic and potential energies for a system at a given temperature, from which the system's heat capacity can be computed. However, equipartition also gives the average values of individual components of the energy, such as the kinetic energy of a particular particle or the potential energy of a single spring. For example, it predicts that every atom in a monatomic ideal gas has an average kinetic energy of (3/2)kBT in thermal equilibrium, where kB is the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>constant</b> and T is the (thermodynamic) temperature. More generally, equipartition {{can be applied to}} any classical system in thermal equilibrium, no matter how complicated. It can be used to derive the ideal gas law, and the Dulong–Petit law for the specific heat capacities of solids. The equipartition theorem {{can also be used to}} predict the properties of stars, even white dwarfs and neutron stars, since it holds even when relativistic effects are considered.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{there are}} several {{scientific}} approaches to the explanation of temperature: the classical thermodynamic description based on macroscopic empirical variables that {{can be measured in}} a laboratory; the kinetic theory of gases which relates the macroscopic description to the probability distribution of the energy of motion of gas particles; and a microscopic explanation based on statistical physics and quantum mechanics. In addition, rigorous and purely mathematical treatments have provided an axiomatic approach to classical thermodynamics and temperature. Statistical physics provides a deeper understanding by describing the atomic behavior of matter, and derives macroscopic properties from statistical averages of microscopic states, including both classical and quantum states. In the fundamental physical description, using natural units, temperature may be measured directly in units of energy. However, in the practical systems of measurement for science, technology, and commerce, such as the modern metric system of units, the macroscopic and the microscopic descriptions are interrelated by the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>constant,</b> a proportionality factor that scales temperature to the microscopic mean kinetic energy.|$|E
25|$|A {{metal ion}} {{with a single}} {{unpaired}} electron, such as Cu2+, in a coordination complex provides the simplest illustration of the mechanism of paramagnetism. The individual metal ions are kept far apart by the ligands, {{so that there is}} no magnetic interaction between them. The system is said to be magnetically dilute. The magnetic dipoles of the atoms point in random directions. When a magnetic field is applied, first-order Zeeman splitting occurs. Atoms with spins aligned to the field slightly outnumber the atoms with non-aligned spins. In the first-order Zeeman effect the energy difference between the two states is proportional to the applied field strength. Denoting the energy difference as ΔE, the Boltzmann distribution gives the ratio of the two populations as , where k is the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>constant</b> and T is the temperature in kelvins. In most cases ΔE is much smaller than kT and the exponential can be expanded as 1 – ΔE/kT. It follows from the presence of 1/T in this expression that the susceptibility is inversely proportional to temperature.|$|E

The proposed sinterability parameter is S(T) =g/[NS. r.

For high temperatures, T> 0. 8 Tm, where Tm is the melting point, another expression can be used: ShT(T) = 2 PI. g-R. Tm^ 2. Vm^ 3 / 2 /[NS. r. kB. DHm.

25|$|In {{the view}} of Jaynes (1957), {{thermodynamic}} entropy, as explained by statistical mechanics, {{should be seen as}} an application of Shannon's information theory: the thermodynamic entropy is interpreted as being proportional to the amount of further Shannon information needed to define the detailed microscopic state of the system, that remains uncommunicated by a description solely in terms of the macroscopic variables of classical thermodynamics, with the constant of proportionality being just the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>constant.</b> For example, adding heat to a system increases its thermodynamic entropy because it increases the number of possible microscopic states of the system that are consistent with the measurable values of its macroscopic variables, thus making any complete state description longer. (See article: maximum entropy thermodynamics). Maxwell's demon can (hypothetically) reduce the thermodynamic entropy of a system by using information about the states of individual molecules; but, as Landauer (from 1961) and co-workers have shown, to function the demon himself must increase thermodynamic entropy in the process, by at least the amount of Shannon information he proposes to first acquire and store; and so the total thermodynamic entropy does not decrease (which resolves the paradox). Landauer's principle imposes a lower bound on the amount of heat a computer must generate to process a given amount of information, though modern computers are far less efficient.|$|E

Although the Eyring transition-state theory seemingly affords a more definitive {{solution to the problem}} of characterizing the activation energetics, the analysis is equivocal because of inherent assumptions about reaction mechanism and the magnitude of the transmission coefficient. In view of those uncertainties it is suggested that a preferable course of action entails reversion to the empirical Arrhenius analysis with regard to the energy of activation and a preexponential factor. The former is essentially equivalent to the enthalpy of activation, whereas the magnitude of the latter indicates directly the extent of disparity between the frequency of product formation and the universal frequency factor (temperature multiplied by the ratio of the <b>Boltzmann</b> and Planck <b>constants)</b> and hence the likelihood of a more complicated kinetic mechanism than that encompassed by the Eyring transition-state theory.

It is shown that increasing initial rotational energy enhances a resonant character of the vibrational energy transfer to a great extent. An assumption is made that total vibrational relaxation of HF(v = 1) at high temperatures is determined by competition between vibrational relaxation to a resonant level (v = 0,jres), vibrational excitation from the resonant level, and purely rotational relaxation of HF(v = 0,jres).
