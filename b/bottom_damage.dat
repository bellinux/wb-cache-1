40|$|Today damage {{stability}} {{calculations are carried}} out in three major steps: Firstly a damage generation, sec-ondly a system response and thirdly a validation of the system response are carried out and therefore the gen-eration of damages is highly time consuming. This pa-per suggests a methodology to automate the damage generation by using Monte Carlo simulations. This methodology is exemplified with <b>bottom</b> <b>damages</b> {{and based on the}} probability density functions given in the IMO / MARPOL- Oil-outflow regulations. The paper shows on one hand the statistical inconsistency of these functions, but will on the other hand demonstrate that damage generation with the Monte Carlo simulations is applicable with very short calculation times. That opens the opportunity to compare different subdivision ar-rangements even in an early design stage of a vessel quickly. Furthermore this methodology can be extended to side damages, because the automization of the dam-age generating is in focus...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of the {{presented}} work a hull girder ultimate strength analyses of the double hull oil tanker structures damaged by the collision or grounding is performed. An incremental-iterative progressive collapse analysis method prescribed by the forthcoming IACS Harmonized Common Structural Rules (H-CSR) is used for determination of the ultimate vertical bending moment and collapse sequence of the considered structures. Three characteristic variants of the oil tanker main frame cross sections of a different geometry and size (Aframax, Suezmax and VLCC) are considered. The position of a ship’s side and/or <b>bottom</b> <b>damage</b> is defined in accordance with the IACS H-CSR. Proposed analytical formulations of the relationship between reduction of the hull girder ultimate vertical bending moment (with respect to the undamaged state) and damage size are {{based on the results of}} a systematic variation of a ship’s side or <b>bottom</b> <b>damage</b> size.

40|$|This article {{covers the}} {{reliability}} {{assessment of the}} hull girder of a crude oil tanker, referring to a scenario in which the ship is exposed to sea loads after a damage {{to the bottom of}} the hull has occurred. A number of possible flooding configurations are examined, each one caused by a group of damage cases, characterized by different location and extent. Static loads, wave loads and residual structural resistance are determined for each damage case, with the objective of obtaining a prediction for the probability of the hull girder’s failure. The various damage cases are compared to each other and unconditioned to derive the probability of failure extended to the ship’s life due to a generic <b>bottom</b> <b>damage.</b> A probabilistic Bayesian Network model has been created to deal with these variables and with the dependency relationships existing between them. The results provided by the model are analyzed with the aim of identifying the parameters most influencing the problem. The work is intended to contribute to the development of a more rational treatment of accidental conditions in design structural requirements for ships...|$|E

500|$|Following {{a repair}} period at the Norfolk Navy Yard, De Soto {{conducted}} a cruise to New Orleans in May and June, putting {{in at the}} Philadelphia Navy Yard on 21 June. She stood down on the Delaware River five weeks later, this time sailing to Mexico. Off Vera Cruz, Mexico, on 17 September, the steamer watched {{the last of the}} French occupation end before sailing to Pensacola, Florida, for repairs in mid-October. De Soto proceeded south along the Florida coast on 22 October, stopping at Tampa Bay and Key West before arriving at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, on 17 November. The ship, in company with sidewheel steamer [...] and screw sloop-of-war , was there as part of Secretary of State William H. Seward's plan to purchase the Danish West Indies. The day after De Sotos arrival, however, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck the region and a tsunami swept the steamer from her moorings and threw the ship onto a wharf. Luckily, the next wave lifted the ship and carried her back to deep water. With her <b>bottom</b> <b>damaged</b> and leaking badly, De Sotos sailors and carpenters spent the next ten days pumping water and repairing the hull. On 5 December, the steamer sailed north with the Danish Commissioner on board and the ship arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on the 17th.|$|R

40|$|This {{propeller}} {{was built}} in 1943 by Bethlehem-Sparrows Point Shipyard, Sparrows Point, Maryland. She was owned by the U. S. Maritime Commission until 1943, when she was sold to the U. S.

She was then sold to Gulf Oil Company in 1947, Maryland Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in 1958, Pioneer Steamship Company in 1960, Columbia Transportation Company in 1962, and American Steamship Company in 2006. In 1947, she became "GulfOil," in 1961, she became "Pioneer Challenger," in 1962, she became "Middleton," and in 2006, she became "American Victory. " She was converted to dry bulk carrier in 1961, then to a self-unloader in 1982. She was laid down as "Marquette. " She was built under U. S. Maritime Commission contract as T 3 -S-A 1 tanker. As "GolfOil," she collided with tanker "S. E. Graham", August 7, 1958, at Newport, Rhode Island. The "Graham," who was carrying one million gallons of gasoline, exploded, killing fifteen crewmen from "GulfOil.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} determine the consequences of intentional grounding (structural damage, rupture, potential flooding or oil spill), including further progress of damage and spill due to tidal variations and/or escalation of waves and wind. The grounding process is decoupled into rigid body motion and resistance to penetration of the bottom structure. The latter is calculated {{on the basis of}} predetermined resistance- penetration relationships for typical ship bottom structures and/or simplified methods. Degradation of hull girder capacity due to <b>bottom</b> <b>damage</b> and initial damage is taken into account. Required tug force to pull the ship off the ground is also estimated The work is part of a project devoted to development of a decision support system, which will provide guidance to the shipmaster and the various levels of decision makers on board and on shore on how to operate a ship once a potentially critical damage has occurred: i. e. how to maneuver in critical waters with loss of propulsion or damaged maneuvering systems, how to operate / navigate to limit sea loads, such that hull damage (e. g. due to collision, grounding, overloading of degraded structure) does not propagate to a critical level for the entire ship, and, as a last resort, to assess the consequences of running the ship aground. The project is funded by the European Community under Framework Programme 6...|$|E
40|$|Hull-girder {{residual}} strength after grounding was investigated for four double hull tankers, three bulk carriers and one single hull VLCC. It is {{noted that the}} loss of section modulus (to the deck and to the bottom) and the loss of ultimate strength (sagging and hogging conditions) are approximately proportional to the transverse damage extent in bottom. Such relationships, when expressed as dimensionless form, do not seem to depend on the ship’s length, but are different for different types of ships. The ship’s speed that results in a given <b>bottom</b> <b>damage</b> extent in a grounding accident is predicted using a simplified analytical method. The influential effects of ship’s speed on the {{residual strength}} of hull-girder are shown. It is revealed that when damaged to a same percent of the ship’s breadth, a double hull tanker and a bulk carrier have comparable hull-girder residual strength, and are better than a single hull tanker. If sailing at a specific speed and running aground, a single hull tanker will have a residual hull-girder strength that is comparable to a double hull tanker of a similar size which loses outer skin only. Oil tankers, both single hull and double hull, seem to have more reserve in residual strength than bulk carriers. 1 The views presented in this paper {{are those of the authors}} alone and are not necessarily of ABS. 1...|$|E
