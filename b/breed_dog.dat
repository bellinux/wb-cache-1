40|$|Medical {{records of}} 41 dogs, {{including}} 15 small <b>breed</b> <b>dogs</b> (15 kg), with cervical intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) that underwent a hemilaminectomy were reviewed. Dogs were diagnosed using myelography, computed tomography/myelography, or MRI, and dogs {{were classified as}} having either Hansen Type I disc extrusion or Hansen Type II disc protrusion located ventrally, ventrolaterally, or laterally within the cervical spinal canal. The most common clinical presentation was ambulatory tetraparesis and/or lameness (44 %). The most affected sites for cervical IVDD were between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae (C 6 –C 7; 78 % of Hansen Type II discs) and C 2 –C 3 (86 % of Hansen Type I discs). Treatment was effective in 88 % of <b>dogs.</b> Five large <b>breed</b> <b>dogs</b> (12 %) did not improve. In dogs with a Hansen Type I disc extrusion, clinical signs improved in 96 % of the cases. In dogs with a Hansen Type II disc protrusion, an excellent and good outcome was seen in 47 % and 32 % of cases, respectively. Outcome was significantly better for small <b>breed</b> <b>dogs</b> and dogs with Hansen Type I disc disease compared with large <b>breed</b> <b>dogs</b> and dogs with Hansen Type II disc disease...|$|R

40|$|Each day, {{the small}} animal {{orthopedic}} surgeons at The Ohio State University’s Veterinary Medical Center see {{a handful of}} patients with hindlimb lameness. Although lameness could indicate a number of orthopedic or neurological issues, rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) of the stifle is frequently the cause. Owners often elect surgery to repair the torn ligament, with tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) as the favored procedure. This study reviewed retrospective data from TPLOs performed in 2012 to identify potential factors associated with CCL rupture. Age, body condition, and previous orthopedic conditions {{were expected to be}} of greatest interest in this study. A total of 201 TPLOs performed on 189 dogs throughout 2012 were reviewed. There was a significant difference (p = 0. 001) in the age at surgery of small and large <b>breed</b> <b>dogs</b> receiving a TPLO; the median age in small <b>breed</b> <b>dogs</b> was 8. 0 years old compared to 5. 1 years in large <b>breed</b> <b>dogs.</b> A total of 32 % of dogs were considered overweight at the time of surgery. Only 18 % of large <b>breed</b> <b>dogs</b> had been previously diagnosed with orthopedic conditions, but 44 % of small <b>breed</b> <b>dogs</b> had other orthopedic problems prior to CCL rupture. Also of note was the occurrence of meniscal injury in approximately half of the cases.

40|$|The {{effect of}} breed and body weight on {{longevity}} in the pet dog was analyzed, and a method {{was developed to}} standardize the chronological age of dogs in terms of physiological time, using human year equivalents. Mortality data from 23, 535 pet dogs were obtained from a computerized data base of North American veterinary teaching hospitals, and the median age at death was determined for pure and mixed <b>breed</b> <b>dogs</b> of different body weight. Body size in the dog was inversely related to longevity. Within each body weight category, the median age at death was lower for pure <b>breed</b> <b>dogs</b> compared with mixed <b>breed</b> <b>dogs.</b> The difference between the standardized physiological ages of mixed <b>breed</b> <b>dogs</b> of the same chronological age in the smallest and largest body weight categories varied from 8 to> 15 years, and between large and small pure <b>breed</b> <b>dogs,</b> the disparity was even greater.
