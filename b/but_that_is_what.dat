2500|$|Upon the Exhibition of {{the work}} at Art Chicago in 2008, critic Alan Artner led his review of the Fair with the {{headline}} 'A New Medium Emerges', opining that 'Not many times in life can anyone see an artist pioneer a significant new medium. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we see in John Gerrard's Dust Storm (Manter, Kansas).

2500|$|In January 2008, Kaz Hirai, CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, {{suggested}} that the console may start making a profit by early 2009, stating that, [...] "the next fiscal year starts in April {{and if we can}} try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing" [...] and that [...] " [...] is not a definite commitment, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I would like to try to shoot for". However, market analysts Nikko Citigroup have predicted that PlayStation 3 could be profitable by August 2008. In a July 2008 interview, Hirai stated that his objective is for PlayStation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year, surpassing PlayStation 2's sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market. In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q3 2008.|$|E

60|$|Evelyn {{looked at}} him in surprise. She {{scarcely}} thought he could regret the efforts he had made on her sister's behalf, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> his words implied. He noticed her change of expression.|$|R
60|$|Simon {{examined}} Hal {{closely on}} {{what he had said}} to his mother, sighed heavily, and chided him for prating when he had been warned against it, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> came of dealing with children and womenfolk.|$|R
60|$|Miss Mackenzie did {{not dare}} {{to say that she}} would have {{preferred}} to be wicked, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> she would have said if she had dared.|$|E
6000|$|... "Possibly; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> {{the doctor}} said, you know. Good-bye!" [...] and Jess took her big basket and started on what John used feebly {{to call her}} [...] "rational undertaking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think he's all right, Dave," [...] {{returned}} Roger. [...] "Of course, he's business clean through. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> you've got {{to expect}} {{from a man who}} holds such a position." ...|$|E
5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people and he brought out {{the worst in}} them... He clung {{to the idea of}} being 'tough'. He thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> had brought him to the edge of greatness. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you know?" [...] and Ingleby's laugh had a {{trace of}} {{bitterness}} in it. [...] "When it is over they don't want me. Of course, we helped them to win, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> I <b>was</b> there for--that, and nothing more--while you played splendidly. You see, one depends so much upon his partner." ...|$|R

Winning cox Zorilla said [...] "It <b>was</b> fun, tough <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> we expected. We {{had a plan}} and we stuck to it ruthlessly." [...] His Light Blue counterpart, Fieldman, remarked: [...] "I {{asked a lot of}} the guys and they gave it me every time. [...] Unfortunately it wasn't quite enough.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I {{never can}} understand. I see by woeful {{experience}} {{that what is}} pretty in itself will not make a pretty drawing, and everyone says so; but I never could find out why." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> you are {{prepared}} to do!" [...] said he, and he held her {{away from him and}} stared at her, as if he had never seen Elspeth before. [...] "Were you not afraid?" [...] he exclaimed, in amazement.|$|E
60|$|Everything {{neat and}} trim and clean like the town. The loveliest {{trees and the}} {{greatest}} variety I have ever seen anywhere, except approaching Darjeeling. Have not heard anyone call Natal the garden of South Africa, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> it probably is.|$|E
50|$|When {{it first}} opened, it was unique because {{his was the}} first non-country act {{to open in the}} then-mostly-country music town. It was said he was {{discouraged}} by many back home in California from making such a bold move, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> he wanted. Other non-country entertainers like Bobby Vinton, Tony Orlando, Wayne Newton and the Osmond Brothers soon followed.|$|R

6000|$|... (Sneeringly.) A cow college. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not <b>what</b> I mean. He is a demagogue, {{stirring}} up the wild-beast passions of the people.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eight years ago," [...] I said. [...] "That's the way I {{remember}} it, though why I {{should remember}} {{it at all}} I don't know. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he said," [...] I went on with increasing confidence. [...] "Eight years ago. I am sure of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you are right, Gilmore," [...] {{answered}} the young captain. [...] "And I am not sorry. It {{will help us}} to forget the rain and our other discomforts." [...] Ben did not say it would help him to forget about Larry, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he meant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, sir, I thought," [...] he said, slowly, [...] "that it {{was going}} to be you and Miss Greendale. I had always thought so. Excuse me, sir, I don't mean any offence, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we have all thought ever since she came down to christen the yacht." ...|$|E
6000|$|We said {{we must be}} {{with him}} all the time; we must have all of him we could; the days were {{precious}} now. Yet we {{did not go to}} seek him. It would be like meeting the dead, and we were afraid. We did not say it, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> we <b>were</b> feeling. And so it gave us a shock when we turned a curve and came upon Nikolaus face to face. He shouted, gaily: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may {{put it in}} what {{language}} you like, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> about <b>what</b> I mean. The {{people who}} go to the balls cannot in truth afford it." ...|$|R
60|$|MITCHENER. Excuse me, Balsquith; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> {{consideration}} <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we call cowardice in the army. A soldier always assumes <b>that</b> he <b>is</b> {{going to}} shoot, {{not to be}} shot.|$|R
60|$|A YOUNG MAN. Some dream {{when they}} are awake, {{but they are the}} crazy, and who would believe what they say? Forgive me, master, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> you taught me to say. That is what you said to the monk when he spoke of the visions of the saints and the martyrs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Colonel Beaupree's estate," [...] {{interrupted}} Octavia, emphasizing {{her words}} with appropriate dramatic gestures, [...] "is of Spanish castellar architecture. Colonel Beaupree's resources are--wind. Colonel Beaupree's stocks are--water. Colonel Beaupree's income is--all in. The statement lacks the legal technicalities to which I {{have been listening}} for an hour, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> it means when translated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{give you}} any details, for I was--ahem!--sick {{at the time and}} did not quite understand," [...] went on Hooker Montgomery, and Dave reasoned, and rightfully, that he had been under the {{influence}} of liquor. [...] "Of course, they'll deny the whole thing. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> they plotted to do to you." ...|$|E
60|$|Mad for Angry. An Americanism of {{lessening}} prevalence. It <b>is</b> probable <b>that</b> anger <b>is</b> a kind {{of madness}} (insanity), <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not <b>what</b> the misusers of the word mad mean to affirm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} father; [...] "it {{might be in}} season to save your dinner, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not <b>what</b> I <b>am</b> {{planning}} to save. I have no particular uneasiness about your dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may <b>be</b> so, Disco, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> only <b>what</b> may <b>be</b> styled the don't {{side of the}} question. <b>What</b> {{troubles}} me <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> I don't {{see much}} on the do side of it." ...|$|R
60|$|Who knows, Colvin, but I {{may thus}} be of more use when I am buried than ever when I was alive? The more I think of it, the more earnestly do I desire this. I may perhaps {{try to write}} it better some day; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I want in sense. The verses are from a beayootiful poem by me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well! I {{have been}} thinking! Our {{marriage}} {{was the best}} and worst thing I ever did. It was unjust to you, and as bad as possible towards them; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I can't be as sorry for as it deserves,' and he looked up with a sweet smile, fading at once--'except when I look at you and the children, and think what is to become of you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't doubt Him," [...] she continued. [...] "I have {{believed}} in Him {{ever since the}} time when I was such a lonely child that I did not know His name. I shall always believe in Him so long as He does not take you from me. But if He does, then I shall not believe in Him any more. It may be wrong, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I feel.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{asked them}} to stay a little longer and I think they'll agree. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not <b>what</b> I came to see you about. Colston laid a {{proposition}} before me--you're formally invited to return home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] Acton answered, [...] "you must judge {{just now}} by contraries. There {{is more than}} there looks to <b>be.</b> I expect <b>that</b> {{combination}} one of these days; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not <b>what</b> I meant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah, Dave, that's the talk!" [...] cried Roger, {{with sudden}} enthusiasm. [...] "I didn't think of it, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> just <b>what</b> <b>is</b> needed to clear 'em! We'll knock Jason Sparr's accusations into a cocked hat!" ...|$|R
