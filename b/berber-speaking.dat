25|$|Adding up the {{population}} (according {{to the official}} census of 2004) of the <b>Berber-speaking</b> regions as shown on a 1973 map from the CIA results in at least 10 million speakers, not counting the numerous Berber population which lives outside these regions in the bigger cities.|$|E
25|$|In Roman times, the indigenes of {{northwest}} Africa (modern Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco) all {{belonged to the}} <b>Berber-speaking</b> nation. The Romans called these peoples, loosely east to west, Libyae, Afri (in Tunisia, from which probably derives the name Africa), Numidae (E. Algeria) and Mauri (W. Algeria/Morocco), from which derives the name Moors.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of these {{geographic}} influences, the genetic profile of the Moroccan population is a complex mosaic of autochthonous Maghrebi lineages, as well as Northeast African, European, West Asian and West African elements in variable degrees. Though Northwest Africa has experienced gene flow from the surrounding regions, it has also undergone long periods of genetic isolation in some parts. This has allowed distinctive genetic markers to evolve in some Maghrebi populations, especially in certain isolated <b>Berber-speaking</b> groups.|$|E
25|$|Around 90% of the <b>Berber-speaking</b> {{population}} speak one of {{six major}} varieties of Berber, each {{with at least two}} million speakers. They are, in order of number of speakers: Shilha (Tacelḥit/Tasussit), Kabyle (Taqbaylit), Central Atlas Tamazight (Tamaziɣt), Riffian (Tmaziɣt), Shawiya (Tacawit) and Tuareg (Tamaceq/Tamajaq/Tamahaq). The extinct Guanche language spoken on the Canary Islands by the Guanches, as well as the languages of the ancient C-Group culture in present-day southern Egypt and northern Sudan, are believed to have belonged to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family.|$|E
25|$|Bedouin Arabs {{continued}} to arrive into the 13th century. With their tribal ability to raid and war still intact, they remained problematic and influential. The Arab language {{came to be}} predominant, {{except for a few}} <b>Berber-speaking</b> areas, e.g., Kharijite Djerba, and the desert south. An unfortunate divide developed between the governance of the cities and that of the countryside; at times the city-based rulers would grant rural tribes autonomy ('iqta') in exchange for their support in intra-maghribi struggles. Yet this tribal independence of the central authority meant also that when the center grew weak, the periphery might still remain strong and resilient.|$|E
25|$|Eurasian haplogroups such as Haplogroup J and Haplogroup R1 {{have also}} been {{observed}} at very minimal frequencies. A thorough study by Cruciani et al. (2004) which analyzed populations from Morocco concludes that the North African pattern of Y-chromosomal variation (including both J1 and R1b haplogroups) is largely of Neolithic origin, {{which suggests that the}} Neolithic transition {{in this part of the}} world was accompanied by demic diffusion of <b>Berber-speaking</b> pastoralists from the Algerian Desert into Eastern Morocco, although later papers have suggested that this date could have been as long as ten thousand years ago, with the transition from the Oranian to the Capsian culture in North Africa.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{cultural}} and political movement among speakers of the closely related varieties of Northern Berber to promote and unify them under a written standard language called Tamaziɣt. The name Tamaziɣt (or Tamazight) is the current native name of the Berber language in the Moroccan Middle Atlas region, the Rif regions and the Libyan Zuwarah region. In other <b>Berber-speaking</b> areas this name was lost. There is historical evidence from medieval Berber manuscripts that all indigenous North Africans from Libya to Morocco have at some point called their language Tamaziɣt. The name Tamaziɣt is currently being used increasingly by educated Berbers {{to refer to the}} written Berber language, and even to Berber as a whole, including Tuareg.|$|E
25|$|Bedouin Arabs {{continued}} to arrive into the 13th century; with their tribal ability to raid and war still intact, they remained influential. The Arab language {{came to be}} predominant, {{except for a few}} <b>Berber-speaking</b> areas, e.g., Kharijite Djerba, and the desert south. Also, Arab Muslim and Jewish migration {{continued to}} come into Ifriqiya from al-Andalus, especially after the fall of Granada in 1492, the last Muslim state ruling on the Iberian peninsula. These newly arriving immigrants brought infusions of the developed arts of al-Andalus. The Andalusian tradition of music and poetry was discussed by Ahmad al-Tifasi (1184–1253) of Tunis, in his Muta'at al-Asma' fi 'ilm al-sama , in volume 41 of his enciclopedia.|$|E
25|$|The {{peoples of}} North Africa consist of three main {{indigenous}} groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking {{peoples in the}} east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo- European Greeks, Romans, and Vandals settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within Morocco and Algeria in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya. The <b>Berber-speaking</b> Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, {{there is a small}} but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.|$|E
2500|$|Tunisia: Basset (1952) {{estimated}} about 1 percent, as did Penchoen (1968). According to Ethnologue, {{there are}} only 26,000 speakers (1998) of a Berber language it calls [...] "Djerbi", but which Tunisians call [...] "Shelha", in Tunisia, all in the south around Djerba and Matmata. The more northerly enclave of Sened no longer speaks Berber. This would make 0.3 percent of the population. Chenini {{is also one of}} the rare remaining <b>berber-speaking</b> villages in Tunisia.|$|E
2500|$|Berber {{is spoken}} by large populations of Algeria, Morocco and Libya, and by smaller populations of Tunisia, {{northern}} Mali, western and northern Niger, northern Burkina Faso, Mauritania {{and in the}} Siwa Oasis of Egypt. Large <b>Berber-speaking</b> migrant communities, today numbering about 4 million, {{have been living in}} Western Europe, spanning over three generations, since the 1950s. The number of Berber people is much higher than the number of Berber speakers. The bulk of the populations of the Maghreb countries are considered to have Berber ancestors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{inhabitants of}} Libya belonged predominantly to various Berber ethnic groups; however, the {{long series of}} foreign invasions– particularly by Arabs and Turks– have had a profound and lasting influence on Libya's demographics. Today, the majority of Libyans are Arab mainly from Banu Sulaym tribe, beside Turkish and Berber ethnicities. The Turkish minority are often called [...] "Kouloughlis" [...] and are concentrated in and around villages and towns. Additionally, there are some Libyan ethnic minorities, such as the <b>Berber-speaking</b> Tuareg and the Tebou.|$|E
2500|$|Morocco: In 1952, André Basset ("La langue berbère", Handbook of African Languages, Part I, Oxford) {{estimated}} that a [...] "small majority" [...] of Morocco's population spoke Berber. The 1960 census claimed that 34 percent of Moroccans spoke Berber, including bi-, tri- and quadrilingual people. In 2000, Karl Prasse cited [...] "more than a third" [...] {{in an interview}} conducted by Brahim Karada at Tawalt.com. A 2007 estimate put the number of Amazigh speakers in Morocco at 7.5 million. According to Ethnologue (by deduction from its Moroccan Arabic figures), the <b>Berber-speaking</b> population should be estimated at 35 percent or around 10.5 million speakers. However, the figures it gives for individual languages only add up to 7.5 million, divided into three languages: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} Roman-era Tunisia {{begins with the}} history of the Roman Africa Province. Rome took control of Carthage after the Third Punic War (149–146). There was a period of Berber kings allied with Rome. Lands {{surrounding}} Carthage were annexed and reorganized, and the city of Carthage rebuilt, becoming the third city of the Empire. A long period of prosperity ensued; a cosmopolitan culture evolved. Trade quickened, the fields yielded their fruits. Settlers from across the Empire migrated here, forming a Latin-speaking ethnic mix. The Carthaginian society made up of native Phoenician-speaking Libyans (Berbers) and Phoenicians, as well as <b>Berber-speaking</b> Libyans, was becoming gradually romanized, some native Libyans [...] like Apuleius and Septimus Severus became great figures of the Roman empire. Christianity became gradually spread among the North Africans, offering to the Roman Catholicism three of its Popes, as well as Augustine of Hippo. During the eclipse of the Roman Empire, several prominent Libyans revolted. A generation later the Vandals, a Germanic tribe, arrived in Tunisia {{with the help of the}} Maurii (Libyans of western north Africa) and reigned over the Roman province for nearly a century. Several Libyan (Berbers) revolts occurred during the reign of the Vandals in the former Roman Africa, some detached themselves and established self-rule at the periphery. The Byzantine Empire eventually recaptured the area from the Vandals into its dominion in 534, which endured until the Islamic conquest, completed in 705. Then came the final undoing of ancient Carthage.|$|E
