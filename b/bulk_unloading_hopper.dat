500|$|The {{stations}} burned {{a mix of}} bituminous and anthracite coal. They consumed [...] of coal {{per week}} and had a peak consumption of [...] per week during the winter. They were well positioned to use coal from the Northumberland and County Durham coal fields. All of the coal used in the stations was brought to them via rail transport from UK coal stocks. Trains delivered coal to the station using the North Blyth Branch of the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The stations' coal handling facility was fitted with a Merry go Round (MGR) coal delivery system in 1981, after high capacity rapid discharge waggons became the British Rail standard. This system involved the trains slowly passing over a hopper and automatically discharging their cargo through doors underneath the train. Because of site space restrictions, a balloon loop track layout could not be constructed, so instead {{of being able to}} move continuously, trains arriving on site had to pull onto a reception track; the locomotive would then uncouple and recouple at the opposite end, before slowly moving over the <b>unloading</b> track <b>hopper</b> and discharging the coal and eventually leaving site. Towards the end of the station's operation, coal was more frequently brought in by road. All coal was delivered to and stored in a large open area {{to the north of the}} power stations. This had a tarmac barrier underneath it to prevent downward contamination. The coal was brought from the storage area to the station using a system of conveyor belts, which travelled over the Bedlington-Cambois Road separating the two sites, before being integrated to feed both stations as necessary.|$|R

These are fitted with clamshell buckets and in operation loaded a hopper, which in turn fed a conveyor system leading to the power station's coal bunkers.

Gas Light and Coke Company had similar facilities at its large gasworks, also alongside the Thames, for handling the large quantity of bituminous coal which was needed to supply the capital with town gas.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Grain dust, {{a health}} and safety risk, is {{generated}} whenever grain is loaded into or <b>unloaded</b> from <b>hoppers</b> and equipment. This research investigated airflow models and evaluated the particle dynamics from a high−pressure water−fog-ging system for potential dust control at a grain−receiving hopper. Experiments were performed in a test chamber, represent-ing a narrow section of a grain−receiving hopper. A 0. 2 mm (0. 008 in.) spray nozzle was used to produce a plume of fog directed across a free−falling grain column. More than 90 % of the fog droplets ranged from 10 to 40 m in diameter. Average droplet velocities in the plume cross−section were over 10 m s− 1 at 7. 6 cm from the nozzle. The air−velocity pressures at 7. 6 cm were parabolic in the radial direction, with maximum pressures over 275 Pa (1. 1 in. H 2 O). Airflow distributions, grain dust transport, and spray droplet trajectories within the test chamber were modeled in three dimensions using FLUENT, which is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software program. Induced airflow from the spray fog caused recirculation {{of the air and}} dust particles in {{the lower part of the}} chamber. This recirculation pattern transported the dust from the grain pile back into the spray plume, where it mixed with the spray fog. The spray produced deposits on the surface of the grain pile ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 4 mg cm− 2 s− 1. However, when the grain pile filled the chamber and was positioned directly in the spray plume, the grain surface deposits were 1. 2 mg cm− 2 s− 1 at the grain peak. The spray produced deposits on the sidewall of the chamber. Sidewall spray deposits were 11 mg cm− 2 min− 1 in the middle of the test chamber and 1. 5 mg cm− 2 min− 1 near the outlet. The sidewall dust deposits during spray treatment ranged from 1. 2 to 0. 5 mg cm− 2 min− 1 and correlated with the spray deposits with an R 2 of 0. 95...|$|R
40|$|Ablation {{of metal}} targets by {{femtosecond}} laser pulses is studied numerically {{by using a}} one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The model describes the absorption of laser radiation, electronic heat conduction, electron–phonon and electron–ion energy exchange and material motion. The temperature dependencies of heat capacities, thermal conductivities and electron–ion collision frequencies are taken into account. The ablation mechanisms are investigated in the intermediate laser fluence range, which is typical for surface processing applications. The employed hydrodynamic model shows that the ablation is driven by a total pressure gradient, which induces a compression (shock) wave propagating into the <b>bulk</b> and an <b>unloading</b> (rarefaction) wave leading to the material expansion. A phenomenon similar to the spallation is observed at fluences close to the ablation threshold. In addition, a fast overheating of the liquid material is observed, which may result into a decomposition of the material to a mixture of gas and droplets. The calculated initial conditions for plasma plume expansion are presented...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a continuous–discontinuous {{computational}} homogenization–localization framework to upscale microscale localization toward the onset and propagation of a cohesive discontinuity at the macroscale. The major novelty of this contribution is the development of a fully coupled micro–macro solution strategy, where the solution procedure for the macroscopic domain is based on the extended finite element method. The proposed approach departs from classical computational homogenization, which allows to derive the effective stress–strain response before the onset of localization. Upon strain localization, the microscale is characterized by a strain localization band where damage grows and by two adjacent <b>unloading</b> <b>bulk</b> regions at each side of the localization zone. The microscale localization band is lumped into a macroscopic cohesive crack, accommodated through discontinuity enriched macroscale kinematics. The governing response of the continuum with a discontinuity is obtained numerically based on proper scale transition relations in terms of the traction–separation law and the stress–strain description of the continuous surrounding material at both sides of the discontinuity. The potential of the method is demonstrated with a numerical example, which illustrates the onset and propagation of a macroscale cohesive crack emerging from microstructural damage within the underlying microstructure...|$|R

50|$|Mechanisation and {{automation}} {{strive to}} reduce the amount of manual labour required for production. The motives for this reduction of effort may be to remove drudgery from people's lives; to lower the unit cost of production; or, as mechanisation evolves into automation, to bring greater flexibility (easier redesign, lower lead time) to production. Mechanisation occurred first in tasks that required either little dexterity or at least a narrow repertoire of dextrous movements, such as providing motive force or tractive force (locomotives; traction engines; marine steam engines; early cars, trucks, and tractors); digging, loading, and <b>unloading</b> <b>bulk</b> materials (steam shovels, early loaders); or weaving uncomplicated cloth (early looms). For example, Henry Ford described his efforts to mechanise agricultural tasks such as tillage as relieving drudgery by transferring physical burdens from human and animal bodies to iron and steel machinery. Automation helps to bring mechanisation to more complicated tasks that require finer dexterity, decision making based on visual input, and a wider variety of intelligent movements. Thus even tasks that once could not be successfully mechanised, such as shelf stocking or many kinds of fruit and vegetable picking, tend to undergo process redesign (either formal or informal) leading to ever smaller amounts of manual labour.|$|R
40|$|Royal Boskalis Westminster nv is an {{international}} group with a leading {{position in the world}} market for dredging services. In most practical cases a jet installation or a big discharge aperture is used for the fast unloading of a load of sand. When a relative small discharge opening, without the use of a jet installation, is used to <b>unload</b> a <b>hopper,</b> the <b>unloading</b> time will increase. Uncertain is how much longer this type of unloading will take and what kind of mechanisms {{play a crucial role in}} this unloading procedure. The goal of this study is to analyse and describe this unloading process. An attempt is made to model the processes in such a way that an estimation can be made for the unloading time. During this research two sets of experiments were executed, the preliminary and the main experiments, each with a different experiment set-up, to obtain more insight in the unloading process. The goal of both sets of experiments was to get a two dimensional view on the sand-water-processes above the discharge opening. The most important parameters which are varied during the experiments are the width of the discharge opening (wdo) and the height of the sand at the start of the unloading process. Out of the preliminary and main experiment comes the qualitative description of the unloading process in time: 1. Coming into existence of a dome. 2. The failure of the dome. 3. Fluidization of sand mass. 4. Break through of water through the sand-water mixture 5. Breaching of sand from the walls at both sides of the discharge opening. For two components out of the unloading process a first set-up for a quantitative model is made with as final goal a good prediction of the total unloading time of a barge. These two components are: 1. The dome that comes into existence 2. The moment of failure of the dome With the theory in this thesis and the data of the executed experiments can be concluded: Total unloading time: o The total unloading time decreases for an increasing width of the discharge opening Expanding velocities: o A new approach has been developed for the single particle mode in which the perpendicular expanding velocity for the roof of the dome (?= 180 degrees) is approximately 2. 2 times larger than expanding velocity perpendicular to the vertical walls (?= 90 degrees). This new approach fits a lot better with the data out of the experiments for the expanding velocities of the dome, but is not yet completely satisfying.
