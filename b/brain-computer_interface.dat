5|$|Olivia and Peter learn Greg {{was being}} treated for a sleep disorder, and that his dreams had {{involved}} demons until they stopped several months ago. Another hallucinating victim turns up in Seattle and dies. The Fringe team discover that both victims had a <b>brain–computer</b> <b>interface</b> chip attached to their thalamus, {{the part of the}} brain controlling dreams. Broyles (Lance Reddick) and Nina (Blair Brown) reveal new information leading to the sleep researcher Dr. Nayak (Ravi Kapoor) who implanted the chips. Another victim named Diana (Jovanna Huguet) hallucinates at a restaurant and kills a coworker before similarly dying of exhaustion.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to a <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interface</b> based on brain waves, as recorded from scalp EEG electrodes, Bin He and co-workers explored a virtual EEG signal-based <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interface</b> by first solving the EEG inverse problem and then used the resulting virtual EEG for <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interface</b> tasks. Well-controlled studies suggested the merits of such a source analysis based <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interface.</b>|$|E
25|$|While an EEG based <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interface</b> {{has been}} pursued {{extensively}} {{by a number}} of research labs, recent advancements made by Bin He and his team at the University of Minnesota suggest the potential of an EEG based <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interface</b> to accomplish tasks close to invasive <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interface.</b> Using advanced functional neuroimaging including BOLD functional MRI and EEG source imaging, Bin He and co-workers identified the co-variation and co-localization of electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals induced by motor imagination.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a short {{introduction}} to a special ICMI session on brain-computer interaction. During this paper, we first discuss problems, solutions, and a five-year view for brain-computer interaction. We then talk further about unique issues with multimodal and hybrid <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interfaces,</b> which could help address many current challenges. This paper presents some potentially controversial views, which will hopefully inspire discussion about the different views on <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interfacing,</b> how to embed <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interfacing</b> in a multimodal and multi-party context, and, more generally, how to look at <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interfacing</b> from an ambient intelligence point of view...|$|R

25|$|Research on BCIs {{began in}} the 1970s at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) under {{a grant from the}} National Science Foundation, {{followed}} by a contract from DARPA. The papers published after this research also mark the first appearance of the expression <b>brain–computer</b> <b>interface</b> in scientific literature.|$|E
25|$|Development and {{implementation}} of a BCI system is complex and time consuming. In response to this problem, Gerwin Schalk has been developing a general-purpose system for BCI research, called BCI2000. BCI2000 has been in development since 2000 in a project led by the <b>Brain–Computer</b> <b>Interface</b> R Program at the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of Health in Albany, New York, United States.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, OpenBCI {{released}} an eponymous open source <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interface</b> after a successful kickstarter campaign in 2013. The basic OpenBCI has 8 channels, expandable to 16, and supports EEG, EKG, and EMG. The OpenBCI {{is based on}} the Texas Instruments ADS1299 IC and the Arduino or PIC microcontroller, and costs $399 for the basic version. It uses standard metal cup electrodes and conductive paste.|$|E
25|$|Refined by a neuroimaging {{approach}} {{and by a}} training protocol, Bin He and co-workers demonstrated {{the ability of a}} non-invasive EEG based <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interface</b> to control the flight of a virtual helicopter in 3-dimensional space, based upon motor imagination. In June 2013 it was announced that Bin He had developed the technique to enable a remote-control helicopter to be guided through an obstacle course.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of BCI research, another {{substantial}} barrier to using EEG as a <b>brain–computer</b> <b>interface</b> was the extensive training required before users can work the technology. For example, in experiments beginning in the mid-1990s, Niels Birbaumer at the University of Tübingen in Germany trained severely paralysed people to self-regulate the slow cortical potentials in their EEG {{to such an extent that}} these signals could be used as a binary signal to control a computer cursor. (Birbaumer had earlier trained epileptics to prevent impending fits by controlling this low voltage wave.) The experiment saw ten patients trained to move a computer cursor by controlling their brainwaves. The process was slow, requiring more than an hour for patients to write 100 characters with the cursor, while training often took many months. However, the slow cortical potential approach to BCIs has not been used in several years, since other approaches require little or no training, are faster and more accurate, and work for a greater proportion of users.|$|E

500|$|The mu wave is of {{interest}} {{to a variety of}} scholars. Scientists who study neural development are interested in the details of the development of the mu wave in infancy and childhood and its role in learning. [...] Since a group of researchers believe that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is strongly influenced by an altered mirror neuron system and that mu wave suppression is a downstream indication of mirror neuron activity, many of these scientists have kindled a more popular interest in investigating the mu wave in people with ASD. Assorted investigators are also in the process of using mu waves to develop a new technology: the <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interface</b> (BCI). With the emergence of BCI systems, clinicians hope to give the severely physically disabled population new methods of communication and a means to manipulate and navigate their environments.|$|E
500|$|After the episode's broadcast, Popular Mechanics {{published}} an article analyzing the science depicted. They concluded that the <b>Brain–computer</b> <b>interface</b> (BCI) chips, like the ones used in the episode to tie the victims' brains to the computer used by Dr. Laxmeesh Nayak, have also been used on real-life human subjects, though not in relation to controlling sleep cycles. However, the article continued that it is [...] "not currently possible" [...] for BCI chips to [...] "facilitate direct transfer of understandable information from one person's brain to another", nor {{is it possible for}} the chips to [...] "directly read another person's thoughts or dreams" [...] and steal them. In addition, Popular Mechanics noted that Walter's theory of the victims' deaths being caused by exhaustion is [...] "pure bunk", as there are many long-term experiments that have safely tested humans' deprivation of REM sleep. According to one scientist interviewed, though chips shown in [...] "Dream Logic" [...] cause hallucinations, paranoid thoughts, and a disconnect from reality, these traits are [...] "not even remotely possible" [...] outside of fiction.|$|E
