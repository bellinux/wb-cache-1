5|$|A varsity <b>baseball</b> team is an {{established}} part {{of physical education}} departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2008, {{nearly half a million}} high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' <b>baseball</b> teams. The number of Americans participating in <b>baseball</b> has declined since the late 1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate <b>baseball</b> was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school <b>baseball</b> in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School <b>Baseball</b> Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School <b>Baseball</b> Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, <b>baseball</b> is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national <b>baseball</b> team.|$|E

50|$|<b>Baseballs</b> {{have gone}} through only a few small changes since the compromise. During World War II, the US banned the use of rubber for non war-related goods, {{including}} for <b>baseballs.</b> So in 1943, instead of using rubber, <b>baseballs</b> were made with rubberlike shells of balata; a substance, obtained from {{a particular type of}} tropical tree, that was also used in golf balls. Hitting declined significantly in 1943.|$|R

5|$|Many European {{countries}} have professional leagues as well, the most successful, {{other than the}} Dutch league, being the Italian league founded in 1948. Compared to those in Asia and Latin America, the various European leagues and the one in Australia historically have had no more than niche appeal. In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the Olympic Games. The Israel <b>Baseball</b> League, launched in 2007, folded after one season. The Confédération Européene de <b>Baseball</b> (European <b>Baseball</b> Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries, as well as national squads. Other competitions between national teams, such as the <b>Baseball</b> World Cup and the Olympic <b>baseball</b> tournament, were administered by the International <b>Baseball</b> Federation (IBAF) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the International Softball Federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports, the World <b>Baseball</b> Softball Confederation (WBSC). By 2009, the IBAF had 117 member countries. Women's <b>baseball</b> is played on an organized amateur basis {{in many of the}} countries where it is a leading men's sport.
