5|$|<b>Bulker</b> hulls {{are made}} of steel, usually mild steel. Some {{manufacturers}} have preferred high-tensile steel recently {{in order to reduce}} the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of <b>bulker</b> hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E
5|$|Several {{companies}} have large private <b>bulker</b> fleets. The multinational company Gearbulk Holding Ltd. has over 70bulkers. The Fednav Group in Canada operates {{a fleet of}} over 80bulkers, including two designed to work in Arctic ice. Croatia's Atlantska Plovidba d.d. has a fleet of 14bulkers. The H. Vogemann Group in Hamburg, Germany operates a fleet of 19bulkers. Portline in Portugal, owns 10 bulkers. Dampskibsselskabet Torm in Denmark and Elcano in Spain also own notable <b>bulker</b> fleets. Other companies specialize in mini-bulker operations: England's Stephenson Clarke Shipping Limited owns a fleet of eight mini-bulkers and five small Handysize bulkers, and Cornships Management and Agency Inc. in Turkey owns a fleet of seven mini-bulkers.|$|E
5|$|A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or <b>bulker</b> is a {{merchant}} ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized bulk carrier {{was built in}} 1852, economic forces have fuelled {{the development of these}} ships, causing them to grow in size and sophistication. Today's bulkers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, efficiency, and durability.|$|E
5|$|Fewer deck {{officers}} are employed on <b>bulkers</b> than on similarly sized ships of other types. A mini-bulker carries {{two to three}} deck officers, while larger Handysize and Capesize <b>bulkers</b> carry four. Liquid natural gas tankers {{of the same size}} have an additional deck officer and unlicensed mariner.|$|R

5|$|Today, <b>bulkers</b> make up 15% - 17% of the world's {{merchant}} fleets {{and range}} in size from single-hold mini-bulkers to mammoth ore ships able to carry 400,000metric tons of deadweight (DWT). A number of specialized designs exist: some can unload their own cargo, some depend on port facilities for unloading, and some even package the cargo as it is loaded. Over half of all <b>bulkers</b> have Greek, Japanese, or Chinese owners and more than a quarter are registered in Panama. South Korea is the largest single builder of <b>bulkers,</b> and 82% of these ships were built in Asia.|$|R
5|$|As of 2005, {{the average}} <b>bulker</b> {{was just over}} 13 years old. About 41% of all bulkers were less than ten years old, 33% were over twenty years old, and the {{remaining}} 26% were between ten and twenty years of age. All of the 98 bulkers registered in the Great Lakes trade are over 20 years old and the oldest still sailing in 2009 was 106 years old.|$|E
5|$|Loading and {{unloading}} a <b>bulker</b> is {{time-consuming and}} dangerous. The process is planned by the ship's chief mate under {{the direct and}} continued supervision of ship's captain. International regulations require that the captain and terminal master agree on a detailed plan before operations begin. Deck officers and stevedores oversee the operations. Occasionally loading errors are made that cause a ship to capsize or break in half at the pier.|$|E
5|$|The crew on a <b>bulker</b> {{typically}} {{consists of}} 20 to 30people, though smaller ships {{can be handled}} by 8. The crew includes the captain or master, the deck department, the engineering department, and the steward's department. The practice of taking passengers aboard cargo ships, once almost universal, is very rare today and almost non-existent on bulkers.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s and 1990s {{were a very}} unsafe {{time for}} bulk carriers. Many <b>bulkers</b> sank during this time, 99 were lost between 1990 and 1997 alone. Most of these sinkings were sudden and quick, making it {{impossible}} for the crew to escape: more than 650 sailors were lost during this same period. Due partly to the sinking of , a series of international safety resolutions regarding <b>bulkers</b> were adopted during the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|JLâ€™s {{dry bulk}} {{operations}} {{started in the}} late 1970s when {{the focus was on}} handysize bulk carriers/lakers. Today, Lauritzen <b>Bulkers</b> A/S is a major owner and operator of bulk carriers. Lauritzen <b>Bulkers</b> controls a fleet of around 90 handysize, handymax and capesize bulk carriers [...] with an average age of six years in 2014. [...] The handysize operations are the largest business activity and comprises a significant fleet of homogeneous vessels.|$|R
5|$|<b>Bulkers</b> are {{designed}} to be easy to build and to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, <b>bulkers</b> are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, <b>bulkers</b> are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty is one way to measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|R
5|$|Bulk cargo {{can be very}} dense, corrosive, or abrasive. This {{can present}} safety problems: cargo shifting, {{spontaneous}} combustion, and cargo saturation can threaten a ship. The use of ships that are old and have corrosion problems {{has been linked to}} a spate of <b>bulker</b> sinkings in the 1990s, as have the bulker's large hatchways, important for efficient cargo handling. New international regulations have since been introduced to improve ship design and inspection, and to streamline the process of abandoning ship.|$|E
5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a <b>bulker</b> very quickly.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, bulkers were {{involved}} in an alarming number of shipwrecks. This led ship-owners to commission a study seeking to explain the effect of various factors on the crew's effectiveness and competence. The study showed that crew performance aboard bulk carriers was the lowest of all groups studied. Among <b>bulker</b> crews, the best performance was found aboard younger and larger ships. Crews on better-maintained ships performed better, as did crews on ships where fewer languages were spoken.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bulkers</b> are {{segregated}} {{into six}} major size categories: small, handysize, handymax, panamax, capesize, and very large. Very large bulk and ore carriers {{fall into the}} capesize category but are often considered separately.|$|R
5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, <b>bulker</b> crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E
5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend {{to specialize in}} either the liquid or dry bulk trade. Also, these ships have endemic maintenance problems. On one hand, due to a less specialized design, an OBO suffers more from wear and tear during dry cargo onload than a <b>bulker.</b> On the other hand, components of the liquid cargo system, from pumps to valves to piping, tend to develop problems when subjected to periods of disuse. These factors have contributed to a steady {{reduction in the number}} of OBO ships worldwide since the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Pasha <b>Bulker</b> {{left the}} port of Newcastle on 26 July 2007. Four {{kilometres}} out to sea the Japanese salvage tug Koyo Maru connected lines to Pasha <b>Bulker</b> {{for it to be}} towed back to Japan. Metal beams could be seen reinforcing the buckled hull, as these were part of the temporary repair solution affixed at Newcastle.|$|E

5|$|Specialized bulk {{carriers}} {{began to appear}} as steam-powered ships became more popular. The first steam ship recognized as a bulk carrier was the British coal carrier SS John Bowes in 1852. She featured a metal hull, a steam engine, and a ballasting system which used seawater instead of sandbags. These features helped her succeed in the competitive British coal market. The first self-unloader was the lake freighter Hennepin in 1902 on the Great Lakes. This greatly decreased the unloading time of <b>bulkers</b> by using conveyor belt to move the cargo. The first <b>bulkers</b> with diesel propulsion {{began to appear in}} 1911.|$|R

25|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 8 June 2007, Newcastle Port Corporation radioed the 56 moored ships waiting off the coast to load coal to warn them to move out to sea to escape an {{approaching}} storm. Pasha <b>Bulker,</b> along with 10 other ships, did not heed the warning. As the storm hit, Pasha <b>Bulker</b> could not clear the coast and it beached at 9:51am. The ship never called for tug assistance, ran aground with a fully operational engine room and still had both anchors stored in the hawsepipes leading some maritime experts to believe that proper precautions were not taken by the ship's captain.|$|E
25|$|Nobby's Breakwater was {{originally}} {{built in the}} first half of the 19th century to protect ships entering Newcastle Harbour. After the breakwater was completed Nobby's Beach formed against it and over the reefs around Nobby's headland. It is on these reefs where Pasha <b>Bulker</b> came to grief.|$|E
5000|$|Asian {{companies}} {{dominate the}} construction of bulk carriers. Of the world's 6,225 <b>bulkers,</b> almost 62% were built in Japan by shipyards such as Oshima Shipbuilding and Sanoyas Hishino Meisho. South Korea, with notable shipyards Daewoo and Hyundai Heavy Industries, ranked second among builders, with 643 ships. The People's Republic of China, with large shipyards such as Dalian, Chengxi, and Shanghai Waigaoqiao, ranked third, with 509 ships. Taiwan, with shipyards such as China Shipbuilding Corporation, ranked fourth, accounting for 129 ships. Shipyards in these top four countries built over 82% of the <b>bulkers</b> afloat.

5000|$|The Hy-Con {{design was}} {{developed}} to increase safety and the efficiency of cargo handling on <b>bulkers.</b> [...] This design starts as a standard single-hulled ship. [...] Then, the forward and aft holds are built up to double-hull structures.|$|R
50|$|After {{selling off}} 15 of his 17 vessels in 1980 {{just prior to}} the crash, Capt. Lemos re-entered the market in 1985 while {{conditions}} were still at a low ebb, ordering a series of 10 <b>bulkers</b> from Hyundai Heavy Industries.|$|R
25|$|Various {{attempts}} for refloating {{the ship}} were suggested. University of Sydney Honorary Associate Professor Rob Wheen suggested liquefying the sand under the ship by pumping seawater into it. This liquefaction should reduce the friction between {{grains of sand}} and in turn, friction between the ship and sand. Whether {{this would have been}} effective in this case is unknown as Pasha <b>Bulker</b> was lying on rock as well as sand and the ship would have had to be pulled up and over the rocks.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to large creases that were visible {{on both sides}} of the outer hull while the ship was beached, propeller and rudder damage became evident during the operation to remove the ship from the beach. Assessment by divers while the ship was being held offshore determined that one of the ballast tanks was flooded. Minor repairs to Pasha <b>Bulker</b> were conducted in Newcastle harbour before the ship was towed by the Japanese supertug Koyo Maru for major repairs in Japan.|$|E
25|$|The plan {{to salvage}} Pasha <b>Bulker</b> used anchors laid out at sea, which {{the ship was}} to use to then winch itself seawards, and three tug boats towing it {{with the aim of}} {{dragging}} the bow over a rock reef. The carrier would then be pulled seaward in a path between two rocky reefs. A hydrographic survey was conducted to survey and map {{the bottom of the ocean}} through the surf zone using a surf ski single beam echo sounder and GPS. This gave the salvage team more insight into the direction for refloating the ship.|$|E
50|$|Dry {{cargo ships}} today are mainly bulk {{carriers}} and container ships. Bulk carriers or <b>bulkers</b> {{are used for}} the transportation of homogeneous cargo such as coal, rubber, copra, tin, and wheat. Container ships are used for the carriage of miscellaneous goods.|$|R
5|$|Before World War II, the {{international}} shipping demand for bulk products was lowâ€”about 25million tons for metal oresâ€”and {{most of this}} trade was coastal. However, on the Great Lakes, <b>bulkers</b> hauled vast amounts of ore from the northern mines to the steel mills. In 1929, 73 million tons of iron ore was transported on the Lakes, and an almost equal amount of coal, limestone, and other products were also moved. Two defining characteristics of <b>bulkers</b> were already emerging: the double bottom, which was adopted in 1890, and the triangular structure of the ballast tanks, which was introduced in 1905. After World War II, an international bulk trade began to develop among industrialized nations, particularly between the European countries, the United States and Japan. Due to the economics of this trade, ocean <b>bulkers</b> became larger and more specialized. In this period, Great Lakes freighters increased in size, to maximize economies of scale, and self-unloaders became more common to cut turnaround time. The thousand-footers of the Great Lakes fleets, built in the 1970s, were among the longest ships afloat and in 1979, a record 214 million ton of bulk cargo were moved on the Great Lakes.|$|R
5000|$|Oshima {{has built}} {{a number of other}} types of ships.
