50|$|Jack Ford was {{stationed}} in Times Square throughout the broadcast, and was also joined by entertainer Dick Clark (the creator and host of his namesake New Year's Rockin' Eve, which did not air due to ABC 2000) as a correspondent to conduct his traditional countdown. Other correspondents were Charles Gibson in London, Diane Sawyer in New York, Barbara Walters in Paris, Sam Donaldson at the Y2K Command Center in Washington, Connie Chung in Las Vegas, Deborah Roberts at Walt Disney World, Morton Dean in Moscow, and literally hundreds of others at ABC News, technicians and newsmen, who worked throughout the day to bring the broadcast. Those hundreds of others included ABC News personalities stationed {{around the world to}} cover the new year in every time zone, including Elizabeth Vargas in Sydney, Australia, Cokie Roberts at the Vatican, with her mother, the then U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican, <b>Carole</b> <b>Simpson</b> in Chicago, and Bob Brown, who narrated many segments consolidating the day's events. Local stations also featured their own coverage during time local breaks, which varied from traditional breaks for local news and weather to full-scale coverage of local countdowns and possible Y2K bug effects (which in ABC and local coverage, eventually became minimal as little to any issues came out of that).|$|R
50|$|Some former anchors of {{the weekend}} news {{broadcasts}} include Sam Donaldson (Sunday edition, 1979-1988), Kathleen Sullivan (Saturday edition, 1985-1987), Charles Gibson (Saturday edition, 1987-1988), Forrest Sawyer (Sunday edition, 1989-1993), <b>Carole</b> <b>Simpson</b> (Saturday edition, 1988-1993; Sunday edition, 1993-2003), Elizabeth Vargas (Saturday edition, 1997-2003; Sunday edition, 2003-2004), Jim Avila (Saturday edition, 2006-2007), Terry Moran (Saturday edition, 2004-2005), Bob Woodruff (Sunday edition, 2004-2005), Dan Harris (Sunday edition, 2006-2011) and David Muir (Saturday edition, 2007-2011; Saturday and Sunday editions, 2011-2014). Muir, who had taken over World News Saturday in 2007, took over the Sunday broadcast in 2011, ending the practice of using separate anchors for the Saturday and Sunday editions of the program, with ABC renaming both broadcasts as ABC World News with David Muir as a result. David Muir anchored the weekend program until {{he took over the}} weekday broadcast in September 2014. The program returned to using separate anchors for the weekend broadcasts afterward, with Cecilia Vega being named anchor of the Saturday broadcast and Tom Llamas named anchor of the Sunday edition in February 2015. After Vega was named senior White House correspondent, Llamas was named sole weekend anchor in January 2017, as the practice of using separate anchors for the Saturday and Sunday editions ended once again.|$|R
