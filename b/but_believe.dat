5|$|Crysta is a fairy with {{a curious}} nature living in FernGully, a {{pristine}} rainforest free from human intervention. The fairies of FernGully {{once lived in}} harmony with humans, <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> them to have gone extinct after having been driven away by a dark spirit named Hexxus. Crysta is the apprentice of Magi, a motherly-figure fairy who imprisoned Hexxus in a tree. One day Crysta explores a new part of the forest and meets Batty, a bat {{who claims to have}} been experimented on by humans, giving him an obstreperous and unstable personality. However, fairies refuse to believe him, except for Crysta, who volunteers to investigate the situation. She sees Zak, a young lumberjack whom Crysta accidentally shrinks when she tries to save him from being crushed by a falling tree, though does not know how to restore him to normal size.|$|E

25|$|The Zaidi {{doctrine}} of Imamah does not presuppose the infallibility of the imam nor that the Imams receive divine guidance. Zaidis {{also do not}} believe that the Imamate must pass from father to son <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> it can be held by any Sayyid descended from either Hasan ibn Ali or Hussein ibn Ali (as was the case after the death of Hasan ibn Ali). Historically, Zaidis held that Zayd was the rightful successor of the 4th imam since he led a rebellion against the Umayyads in protest of their tyranny and corruption. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action, and the followers of Zayd believed that a true imam must fight against corrupt rulers.|$|E

However, {{thanks to}} Gabi, Will (Chandler Massey) and Chad realize Mia is two-timing them, and dump her. In 2010, as Chad seeks an internship at DiMera Enterprises, he notices tension between Madeline and Will's grandmother, Kate Roberts (Lauren Koslow). Chad is shocked by Will's claim that Madeline and Kate once worked together as prostitutes. Chad immediately confronts Kate {{to get the}} truth. After Kate confirms the story, Chad confronts his mother. Their confrontation ends with Madeline falling {{down a flight of}} stairs. Chad is devastated when Madeline is declared dead but before he has the chance to grieve, DA Charles Woods starts to blame his son for Madeline's death. Despite Madeline's death being the result of a brain aneurism, Chad can't help <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> Charles's words and blames himself.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturers {{point out}} {{that many of the}} {{products}} to be impacted are already making their way through the supply chain. As a result, much inventory that was legal prior to the signing of the law and was manufactured shortly thereafter will probably be on shelves as the deadlines approach. The Natural Resources Defense Council and Public Citizen apparently agree that these products are already in distribution, <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> that manufacturers should still be held liable. The problem is not the lead or phthalate content, as they imply, {{but the fact that the}} products must be tested to make sure they comply. There is also confusion of what products need a GCC and which do not. They have not been tested because the items generally do not contain hazardous materials; CPSC has been slow to define some of the accreditation or testing criteria; some of the low volume, low value items are not economical to test; and lot tracking methods would not allow some of the items to be tracked.|$|E

500|$|On 21 February 2011, Olympiacos beat Panathinaikos in Karaiskaki Stadium (2–1), after a {{controversial}} (regarding the referee's decisions) game. After the game, Cisse had a wrangle with Olympiacos' president Evangelos Marinakis. He was beaten by Olympiakos' fans (later called them [...] "barbarians") {{and stated that}} he was going to appeal to the UEFA. He stated also that he had lost his patience with the questionable, according to his opinion, refereeing in Greece: [...] "I will make my decisions <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> me, I’ve had enough.

He celebrated this goal by wearing a T-shirt of Panathinaikos supporters group Gate 13. Cisse left Greece and Panathinaikos after celebrating in a farewell party with him as the DJ and he gave a promise to Panathinaikos fans that he will return.|$|E
500|$|From its {{inception}} in 2003 through to nearly 2009, Steam had a mostly uncontested hold over the PC digital distribution market before major competitors emerged with the largest competitors in the past being services like Games for Windows – Live and Impulse, {{both of which were}} shut down in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Sales via the Steam catalog are estimated to be between 50 and 75 percent of the total PC gaming market. Steam’s critics often refer to the service as a monopoly, and claim that placing such a percentage of the overall market can be detrimental to the industry as a whole and that sector competition can only yield positive results for the consumer. Several developers also noted that Steam's influence on the PC gaming market is powerful and one that smaller developers cannot afford to ignore or work with, <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> that Valve's corporate practices for the service make it a type of [...] "benevolent dictator", as Valve attempts to make the service as amenable to developers.|$|E

In November 2014, the game had sold 1.4 million copies and by January 2015, the game had sold 2.4 million copies. In January 2015, Ustwo noted that the game had seen {{a large amount of}} {{software}} piracy, with 95% of the installs on Android and 60% on iOS devices coming from unpaid copies; the company asserted some of these may include users installing on multiple devices <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> the majority was though users that had not purchased the title. While these numbers were discouraging, the company asserted it will continue to develop premium titles for mobile devices. Despite the piracy, Ustwo stated they have exceeded $6 million in revenue from sales of the game as of mid-January 2015, exceeding the $1.4 million in development costs. By January 2016, USTwo reported that more than 24 million users have downloaded the game, the ten-fold increase from 2015 partially due to legitimate giveaways of the game through Apple's App Store, Google Play, and Amazon Underground. Of about seven million of the free downloads through Apple, about 35% of them purchased the [...] "Forgotten Shores" [...] expansion.

During the production O'Hara and Harrison intensely disliked each other from the outset, and she {{found him to be}} [...] "rude, vulgar, and arrogant". Harrison had thought that she disliked him simply because he was British. He reportedly belched in her face during dance sequences and accused her of anti-Semitism, being married to a Jewish woman (Lilli Palmer) at the time, which she vehemently denied. Variety, while acknowledging the length, thought that O'Hara and Harrison carried off their dramatic scenes with [...] "surprising skill". The following year, O'Hara starred opposite Robert Young in the commercially successful comedy film, Sitting Pretty. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised O'Hara and Young as husband and wife, remarking that they were [...] "delightfully clever", acting with [...] "elaborate indignation, alternating with good-natured despair".|$|E

2500|$|Anselm {{held that}} faith {{necessarily}} precedes reason, but that reason can expand upon faith: [...] "And I {{do not seek}} to understand that I may believe <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> that I might understand. For this too I believe since, unless I first believe, I shall not understand". This is possibly drawn from TractateXXIX of StAugustine's Ten Homilies on the First Epistle of John: regarding John 7:14–18, Augustine counseled [...] "Do not seek to understand in order to believe <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> that thou may understand". Anselm rephrased the idea repeatedly and Thomas Williams considered that his aptest motto was the original title of the Proslogion, [...] "faith seeking understanding", which intended [...] "an active love of God seeking a deeper knowledge of God". Once the faith is held fast, however, he argued an attempt {{must be made to}} demonstrate its truth by means of reason: [...] "To me, it seems to be negligence if, after confirmation in the faith, we do not study to understand that which we believe". Merely rational proofs are always, however, to be tested by scripture and he employs Biblical passages and [...] "what we believe" [...] (...) at times to raise problems or to present erroneous understandings, whose inconsistencies are then resolved by reason.|$|E

The former group argue, for example, that Congress's power to interfere with intra-executive decision-making (such as firing executive branch officials) is limited, and that the President can control policy-making by all executive agencies within the limits set for those agencies by Congress. Still others agree that the Constitution requires a unitary executive, <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> this to be harmful, and propose its abolition by constitutional amendment.|$|E
