40|$|Group A rotaviruses are {{established}} agents of disease in buffalo calves. Early epidemiological studies in Italian buffalo herds revealed {{the predominance of}} strains with G 8 specificity and detected strains with the rare, RRV-like, VP 4 P[3] genotype. To acquire additional information on the VP 4 and VP 7 specificities of buffalo rotaviruses, a total of 125 fecal samples were collected from buffalo calves affected with diarrhoea, in seven dairy farms in Southern Italy. Rotaviruses were detected in 21 samples (16. 8 %) by an immunochromatographic assay and by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Analysis of the VP 7 gene revealed that 57 % (12 of 21) of the isolates were G 6, 23. 8 % were G 8 (5 of 21) and 19 % (4 of 21) were G 10. Analysis of the VP 4 revealed that 71. 4 % (15 of 21) of the isolates were P[5] and that 28. 6 % (6 of 21) were P[1]. The most common combination of G and P types was P[5],G 6 (57 %), followed by P[1],G 10 (19 %), P[5],G 8 (14 %) and P[1],G 8 (9. 5 %).

40|$|MATERIALS & METHODS. The {{survey was}} based on Veterinary {{post-mortem}} inspections of hunted WBs: jaw and retropharyngeal lymph nodes and tonsils have been withdrawn. WBs have been tested in a convenience sampling: specimens from animals 2 years old and over, with no visible lesions (NVL) and viscera from animals of any age with visible lesions (VL), were submitted to the analysis. Samples were processed for light microscopy (VL+NVL) and tubercle-like positive samples were processed for hemi-nested-PCR and culturing. Isolates of M. bovis were identified by PCR assay and typing with VNTR and Spoligotyping at the Italian National Reference Centre for Bovine Tuberculosis (IZSLER-Brescia). RESULTS.

40|$|Santa Catarina is {{the only}} Brazilian state that does not immunize the <b>bovine</b> <b>herd</b> against {{foot and mouth disease}}. This article {{discusses}} the policy adopted for the foot and mouth disease in Santa Catarina, especially the non-vaccination, and relates this policy with ethical, human and animal welfare issues. Nine representatives of agricultural institutions in the state were interviewed, as well as, in a case study, seven families of farmers in Jóia - Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, where foot and mouth disease occurred in 2000, leading to the sacrifice of 11, 067 animals, most of them dairy animals. The majority of the agricultural institutions in Santa Catarina are contrary to vaccination, in order to keep and extend pig and poultry export markets. Concerns on social repercussions tended to concentrate on the effects on the income of the affected families. The case study in Jóia demonstrated that the life styles of the affected farmers were deeply harmed due to effects on human mental health, loss of income and changes in the local economy. The study concludes that the experience of a foot and mouth disease outbreak results in traumatic and long term consequences {{and that there is a}} need for policies that include social, ethical and environmental provisions, once animal welfare aspects and impacts on other areas of the economy are not contemplated in the public policy of animal sanitary defense...|$|E

40|$|Background: Coxiella burnetii causes Q fever {{in humans}} and Coxiellosis in animals; {{symptoms}} range from general malaise to fever, pneumonia, endocarditis and death. Livestock {{are a significant}} source of human infection as they shed C. burnetii cells in birth tissues, milk, urine and feces. Although prevalence of C. burnetii is high, few Q fever cases are reported in the U. S. and we have a limited understanding of their connectedness due to difficulties in genotyping. Here, we develop canonical SNP genotyping assays to evaluate spatial and temporal relationships among C. burnetii environmental samples and compare them across studies. Given the genotypic diversity of historical collections, we hypothesized that the current enzootic of Coxiellosis is caused by multiple circulating genotypes. We collected A) 23 milk samples from a single <b>bovine</b> <b>herd,</b> B) 134 commercial bovine and caprine milk samples from across the U. S., and C) 400 bovine and caprine samples from six milk processing plants over three years. Results: We detected C. burnetii DNA in 96 % of samples with no variance over time. We genotyped 88. 5 % of positive samples; bovine milk contained only a single genotype (ST 20) and caprine milk was dominated by a second type (mostly ST 8). Conclusions: The high prevalence and lack of genotypic diversity is consistent with a model of rapid spread and persistence. The segregation of genotypes between host species is indicative of species-specific adaptations or dissemination barriers and may offer insights into the relative lack of human cases and characterizing genotypes. © 2014 Pearson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Link fieldBackground: The Icelandic <b>bovine</b> <b>herd</b> has been isolated for over 1100 years. Knowledge is needed about how its milk constituents {{differ from those of}} milk in the other Nordic countries, where cattle have been interbred with other European races. As milk and dairy products comprise a substantial part of food intake, especially in children, variations in cow's milk composition may be of value when considering environmental factors in public health. Regional variation in milk composition may explain contradictory results from studies on milk consumption and aetiology of diseases, type 1 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Objective: To investigate differences in milk composition, particularly substances suggested to influence public health. Design: Analyses of the proteins ß-casein and ß-lactoglobulin, as well as fatty acid profiles and nitrates, were performed in samples of cow's milk as sold to consumers, at four different times during 1 year in three different regions in Iceland and in the capital areas of the other countries. Results: The Icelandic milk was significantly (p< 0. 05) lower in ß-casein fractions A 1 and B and higher in the A 2 fraction, lower in ß-lactoglobulin B and higher in A (p< 0. 001), had less than half in n- 6 /n- 3 ratio and was higher in the very long-chain n- 3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid. It was slightly higher in saturated fatty acids. No significant difference was seen in the total amount of ß-caseins, ß-lactoglobulins or nitrates. Conclusions: Although slightly higher in saturated fatty acids, the Icelandic milk has a composition of proteins and fatty acids that may be associated with health benefits...|$|E
40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhea}} virus (BVDV) {{has become}} an important viral infectious agent in cows and is considered endemic in many regions. This study aimed to determine the epidemiological status of BVDV in <b>bovine</b> <b>herds</b> in the semiarid state of Paraíba, in northeastern Brazil, by determining the frequency of anti-BVDV antibodies and risk factors associated with the infection. We tested 359 cows from 20 farms. Three {{had a history of}} clinically suspected bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) or mucosal disease (MD), whereas the other 17 locations were randomly selected. Detection of anti-BVDV antibodies was performed by indirect ELISA using a commercial kit (IDEXX BVDV p 80 Ab Test). Risk factor analysis was performed in two steps, univariate and multivariate analysis. Seven samples were considered suspicious and were excluded from the analysis of seropositive animals. Of 352 animals, 141 (40. 1 %; CI 95 % = 34. 9 % – 45. 2 %) were seropositive. Of the 20 farms analyzed, 19 (95 %) had seropositive animals and the frequency of seropositivity per farm varied between 4. 5 % and 85. 7 %. The risk factors identified were as follows: area ? 120 hectares (OR = 3. 06; CI 9 5 % = 1. 43 – 6. 53), high animal density (OR = 3. 48; CI 95 % = 1. 24 - 9. 79), weaning age ? 60 days (OR = 10. 99; CI 95 % = 1. 31 - 91. 9), exchange of animals (OR = 4. 95; CI 95 % = 2. 08 - 11. 8), calf mortality > 5 % (OR = 2. 33; CI 95 % = 1. 07 - 5. 11), and use of natural breeding and artificial insemination (OR = 3. 06; CI 95 % = 1. 22 – 7. 67).

40|$|This {{issue of}} the INTERthesis, which, for {{technical}} reasons, is being released {{in the month of}} May of 2008, corresponds to the second semester of 2007. In the search of bigger efficiency in the management of articles received, and the prompt reply to the authors, we are implanting an electronic management system, task which, at a first moment, demands time and hard work; the effort, however, will certainly make things faster in a near future. As well as the other editions of the Journal, the articles assembled here evidence the multiplicity of speeches and areas of knowledge, characteristics of the Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Human Sciences (DICH) of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). The diversity of proposed approaches in these texts allows closeness among several areas of knowledge and speeches characterized by a critical way of looking at our present and our history. The Journal opens with an article by Luis David Castiel, recognized researcher of the National School of Public Health of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (ENSP/Fiocruz), associate publisher of the prestigious ` Notebooks of Public Health Journal' and author of several books and writings dedicated to explore the interfaces between the health sciences and the human sciences. In the article that we publish here, Castiel discusses, one more time, in a discerning and critical way, the problematic of the risk which was also his approach in other studies. However, this time, the author carries through an inciting sociological analysis concerning the {{issue of the}} Brazilian youth identity in relation to the risks in the contemporary culture. The text proposes to discuss the construction of fluid identities in a society marked by the precariousness and the excesses of several kinds, and the consequent attitudes of exposition (adventure) and avoidance (prevention) taken over by the youth. The second article also refers to the youth, and it is dedicated to an evaluation of the university experiences. The author, Muhammad Imran Yousuf, of the Rawalpindi University of Pakistan Department of Education, presents an empirical study performed among a thousand students of twenty universities, reaching unexpected conclusions on the importance of the parents’ role over the professors’ role in the conquest and consolidation of their university performance and their formation abilities as future professionals. Continuing with the thematic of education, Roberto Carlos Simões Galvão, Master in Fundaments of Education from the State University of Maringá (UEM), presents an analysis of Francis Bacon’s thought (1561 - 1626) and its contributions to Education. The author analyzes specifically Bacon’s desire to promote a reorganization of the mastery of the human knowledge, and the impact that this reorganization of knowledge can have over the mastery of Education. Next, Clarissa Franzoi Dri, PhD student at the Institute of Political Studies of the Montesquieu University - Bordeaux IV, questions the perspectives of the Constitutive Protocol of the Mercosur Parliament, signed in 2005, evaluating the difficulties and the perspectives of this fact according to the existing political patterns in South America. The fifth article, by Antonio Manoel Elíbio Júnior, PhD in Social History from the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), with the suggestive, intriguing name of: “Without some sort of reaction, won’t we be doomed?”, approaches the political rows of the constitutionalist revolution that in 1932, starting in São Paulo, reached Rio Grande do Sul. The article analyzes the arguments of the Constituent National Assembly in Rio Grande Do Sul, and the resetting of the political forces between the years of 1932 and 1934. The next article by Izabel Cristina of Santos Teixeira, Professor of Literature and Portuguese Language at the Federal University of Tocantins (UFT), analyzes the concepts on “high” and “low” literature from the points of view pointed by Leyla Perrone-Moisés in her essay “High literatures”, in 1988. Finally, we present an article by the authors Barbara Marins Pettres, Master in Agro ecosystems from the UFSC, Luiz Carlos Pine Axe, PhD in Agronomy and retired University Professor of the Federal University of Rio Grande Do Sul (UFRGS), Maria José Hötzel, PhD in Animal Science from The University of Western Austrália, Tania Maria de Paula Lyra, PhD in Animal Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and Presidency Assessor of the Development Coordination of Higher Education Personnel - CAPES. In their article, they approach the issue of the foot and mouth disease social impacts, and mention that Santa Catarina is the only Brazilian State that does not immunize the <b>bovine</b> <b>herd</b> against this illness. The authors argue the policies that state adopts concerning this illness, especially the non-vaccination, and relate this fact with ethical questions of human and animal welfare. The study concludes that the real experience of an outbreak results in dramatic, social consequences for the affected families, showing a long-term rupture in these families’ rural lifestyles. Last, but not least, this issue also brings the book review of ‘the Ritual Use of the Plants of Power’ by Labate and Goulart, Editora Mercado das Letras, São Paulo, 2005. 518 p.

Sequence analysis of the full length coding sequence cDNA shows high identity to other arthropod paramyosin sequences, and the predicted molecular weight, pI and secondary structure are consistent with a typical paramyosin. Western-blot expression analysis indicates the presence of BmPRM in all tissues and developmental stages tested, but not in saliva. The recombinant protein (rBmPRM) was shown to bind both IgG and collagen. Possible implications of these activities with host evasion mechanisms are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} a genetic basis for IgA concentration in milk of Bos taurus. We used a Holstein-Friesian x Jersey F 2 crossbred pedigree to undertake a genome-wide search for QTL influencing IgA concentration and yield in colostrum and milk. We identified a single genome-wide significant QTL on chromosome 16, maximising at 4. 8 Mbp. The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor gene (PIGR) was within the confidence interval of the QTL. In addition, mRNA expression analysis revealed a liver PIGR expression QTL mapping to the same locus as the IgA quantitative trait locus. Sequencing and subsequent genotyping of the PIGR gene revealed three divergent haplotypes that explained the variance of both the IgA QTL and the PIGR expression QTL. Genetic selection based on these markers will facilitate the production of <b>bovine</b> <b>herds</b> producing milk with higher concentrations of IgA. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe current paper {{presents}} the original results regarding a software programme for production and reproduction data management in dairy farms, used {{also in the}} accounting department and in the genetic breeding of <b>bovine</b> <b>herds.</b> A management system database - SGBD - which assures the independence of logical correlations between dates and their minimum redundancy - was used for this purpose. This provided a fast development and a cost-effective use of application programmes for data exploring from a complex structure and also fast access to the dates, providing them a very good security. Therefore, SGBD is an assembly of programmes which allow the users to interact with a database, designed for large amounts of information, whose management requires not only a rigorous structure but also a rational access and processing. The programme called “C. O. P & R. G” was designed and developed at the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Animal Sciences, Iaşi, Romania and addresses to farmers and units dealing with accounting and improving the milk production of dairy cattle...|$|R
40|$|The {{southern}} cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus, is the ixodid species {{causing the}} largest economic losses in tropical agrosystems {{because of its}} recurrent invasive success, explosive demography on <b>bovine</b> <b>herds,</b> vector competence for diverse pathogens and frequent development of acaricide resistance. Its ecology and the physiological bases of the acaricide resistances it developed, as well as alternative tick control measures, have been intensively studied for decades. By contrast, the tick population genetic structure and its remarkable ability to quickly adapt to new environments have not yet received much attention. We investigated such issues using population genetics analyses in the recently invaded island New Caledonia. In this paper we aim to describe some guidelines for acarologists willing to investigate the processes at play in Acari invasions. Particular emphasis {{is given to the}} accuracy of sampling designs and sampling scales for population genetics to be actually informative on the demographical processes of the species (i. e., its mating rules, the determinants of population limits, population sizes, the relationships between genetic exchanges and geographical distances and relevant ecological factors) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study had}} as {{objective}} {{to provide information}} {{on the behavior of}} calliphorideos in places of dairy cattle rearing, in the south of the Rio Grande do Sul. The work was carried out in Centro Agropecuário da Palma, pertaining to Universidade Federal de Pelotas (UFPEL). For capturing the calliphorideos, two WOT (Wind Oriented Trap) traps, baited with 250 g of decompositionbovine liver were used. The traps were displayed at 50 meters from the milking place, seven days per month, within the 10 th and the 20 th, and the captured specimens were removed from the traps and taken to the Laboratory of Insects Biology for selection, counting and identification. Within the period of March 2007 and the February 2008, 7, 225 calliphorideos were captured, being Chrysomya megacephala the most predominant with 3. 307 specimens (45. 78 %). Considering the monthly distribution of the calliphorideos collected in dairy <b>bovine</b> <b>herds</b> for twelve months, in the South of Rio Grande do Sul, monthly variation in the number of captured species was observed, being Chrysomya albiceps (2. 445), Chrysomya putoria (90), Lucilia cuprina (118), Lucilia eximia (1. 033), Lucilia sericata (41), Sarconesia chlorogaster (73), Calliphora lopesi (113), Hemilucilia semidiaphara (05) ...|$|R

40|$|Bovine {{respiratory}} syncytial viruses virus (BRSV) {{is one of}} the etiologic {{agents of}} pneumonia in young cattle. Few studies have been made aiming detection of the virus in samples collected from adult animals, especially those asymptomatic bovines. However, it is assumed that infections in these groups may occur mostly asymptomatic and this would be an important mechanism for maintaining of BRSV in herds. In this study, the goal was to conduct an analysis of the occurrence of asymptomatic infections by BRSV in lung samples (n= 68) and nasal swabs (209) taken from adult animals collected in abattoirs from Southern and Southeastern Brazil respectively, to detect via polymerase chain reaction the occurrence of infected animals in populations of adult cattle. The samples that resulted positive (6) on RT-PCR were subsequently subjected to cutting with restriction enzymes and sequencing for genetic characterization (2 samples). All samples belongs to subgroup B of BRSV, which is reported as the one circulating in Brazil. The results obtained demonstrate that BRSV may be present in samples taken from adult animals, which is in agreement the hypothesis that infections in adults run in a sub-clinical way that may be of importance as a maintenance mechanism of the virus in <b>bovine</b> <b>herds...</b>|$|R
40|$|Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) is endemic in {{cattle in}} most countries, {{reaching}} {{a level of}} 0. 5 - 2 % persistently infected (PI) animals. Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) is a disease of domestic and wild animals due to Bovine Herpesvirus 1 (BoHV- 1). Both infections are associated with several economic losses worldwide. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the serological situation of both diseases using a commercial ELISA test in 45 herds sampling 1, 716 animals from 4 regions of Central Italy, where voluntary eradication program for IBR was planed. In addition, the BVDV seronegative animals were tested with an antigen capture ELISA (AgELISA-IDEXX) to identify PI animals. 26. 3 % and 25. 5 % of samples were positive respectively for IBR and BVD, meanwhile both antibodies were detected in 10. 7 % sera. All the BVDV seronegative animals were negative to AgELISA. PI animals are the principal source of infection in a farm, but viral transmission can occur also in their absence, as demonstrated by the serological results obtained in this work. The results demonstrate that IBR and BVDV are highly diffused in <b>bovine</b> <b>herds</b> of Central Italy, and the application of voluntary eradication programs is needful to contain further diffusion of the infection and to reduce the economic losses...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} mastitis infection {{on the quality of}} milk composition in small-scale dairy <b>bovine</b> <b>herds.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to find a milk quality somatic cell count (SCC) standard that could be used as an integral component of a control program. In all, 396 quarter milk samples from lactating cross-bred cows (Holstein & Zebu) were analyzed; 56 % of these quarters were experiencing intramammary infection, with an overall mean SCC of 5. 46 × 105 ± 2. 30 × 104 cells/ml. Infected quarters had significantly (p < 0. 05) higher mean SCC levels (6. 19 × 105 ± 4. 40 × 104 cells/ml) compared to healthy quarters (2. 65 × 105 ± 2. 40 × 104 cells/ml). In high SCC milk and infected quarters, the concentrations of non-casein fractions, sodium, chloride, and free fatty acid were higher (p < 0. 05), while the casein content, lactose, casein-to-total protein, potassium, and calcium were lower (p < 0. 05) compared to normal quarters. These findings suggest a mean SCC threshold limit of 5. 46 × 105 cells/ml for the region. It was concluded that the results could be used to propose a milk quality SCC standard that can be used as an integral component of a control program...|$|R
