50|$|<b>Butterfly</b> <b>bombs</b> {{were first}} used against Ipswich in 1940, but were also dropped on Kingston upon Hull, Grimsby and Cleethorpes in June 1943, amongst various other {{targets in the}} United Kingdom. Lieutenant Colonel Eric Wakeling led the {{clearance}} of the unexploded ordnance in Grimsby within the Royal Engineers. They were subsequently used against Allied forces in the Middle East. The British Government deliberately suppressed news of the damage and disruption caused by <b>butterfly</b> <b>bombs</b> {{in order not to}} encourage the Germans to keep using them. On October 28, 1940 some <b>butterfly</b> <b>bombs</b> that had incompletely armed themselves were discovered in Ipswich by British ordnance technicians Sergeant Cann and 2nd Lieutenant Taylor. By screwing the arming rods back into the fuzes (i.e. the unarmed position) the two men were able to recover safe examples to reverse engineer.|$|R

25|$|On 14 June 1943, an early-morning {{air raid}} by the Luftwaffe dropped several 1,000kg bombs, 6,000 {{incendiary}} bombs {{and more than}} 3,000 <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Bombs</b> in the Grimsby area. Ninety-nine people died that night and in total, Second World War bombing raids in Grimsby and Cleethorpes killed a total of 196 persons. In addition 184 people were seriously injured. The <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Bombs,</b> which littered the area, hampered fire-fighting crews trying to reach locations damaged by the incendiary bombs. The search for recovery of bodies continued for {{a month after the}} raid.|$|R
5000|$|The M29 {{cluster bomb}} was a 500 lbs kg cluster bomb {{used by the}} United States Air Force during World War II against troops, {{unarmoured}} vehicles and artillery. [...] The weapon contained ninety 4 lbs kg M83 fragmentation submunitions - a direct copy of the earlier German <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Bomb</b> - in 9 ten-bomb [...] "wafers". [...] The M28 was a 100 lbs kg equivalent of the M29 containing 24 bomblets.|$|E
50|$|The first {{cluster bomb}} used operationally was the German SD-2 or Sprengbombe Dickwandig 2 kg, {{commonly}} referred to as the <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Bomb.</b> It was used in World War II to attack both civilian and military targets. The technology was developed independently by the United States, Russia and Italy (see Thermos Bomb). The US used the 20-lb M41 fragmentation bomb wired together in clusters of 6 or 25 with highly sensitive or proximity fuzes.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the island}} of Malta in 1981 Paul Gauci, a 41-year-old Maltese man, died after welding a <b>butterfly</b> <b>bomb</b> to a metal pipe and {{using it as a}} mallet, {{thinking}} it was a harmless can. [...] The latest find of such a bomb was on 28 October 2009, by an 11-year-old boy in a secluded valley close to a heavily bombarded airfield. This bomb was safely detonated on-site by the Armed Forces of Malta.|$|E
50|$|UK bomb-disposal {{teams were}} having {{continuing}} problems rendering safe with German 2 kg <b>Butterfly</b> <b>bombs</b> because no examples had been safely dismantled {{to learn the}} best process. This was because <b>butterfly</b> <b>bombs</b> were specifically designed to detonate if they were disturbed in any way. Whilst dealing with eight <b>butterfly</b> <b>bombs</b> which had fallen on RAF Harlaxton and failed to explode, Flight Sergeant Hanford of RAF Bomb Disposal (based at RAF Digby) noticed that the arming rods on the bombs had not fully unscrewed themselves i.e. the fuzes were not fully armed. Hanford carefully screwed the arming rods back into the fuze pockets by hand, thereby enabling the bomb disposal scientists to safely dismantle the fuze mechanisms, learn how they worked and develop counter-measures. Highly useful information {{in the form of}} diagrams and detailed explanations were then distributed to bomb disposal technicians for instructional purposes. Hanford was later awarded the British Empire Medal for this feat of extreme bravery.|$|R
50|$|Despite the unthreatening name, people mainly {{interpreted}} Pippo {{as something}} fearful. Superstition held that {{one had to}} block the lights in one’s house or Pippo might fire upon it. It was said to drop exploding pens, poisoned candy, or so-called <b>butterfly</b> <b>bombs</b> and to fire on farm workers in fields.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1920s a {{maternity}} hospital {{was established in}} Second Avenue using converted council houses. This was incorporated into a new building which opened in 1933. In 1943 {{a number of people}} were killed and houses were damaged when <b>butterfly</b> <b>bombs</b> were dropped on the estate during a German air raid on Grimsby.|$|R
5000|$|The last {{recorded}} {{death from}} a German <b>butterfly</b> <b>bomb</b> in England occurred on November 27, 1956, over 11 {{years after the}} end of the war: Flight Lieutenant Herbert Denning of the RAF was examining an SD2 at the [...] "Upminster bomb cemetery" [...] (some remote sandpits situated East of RAF Hornchurch, where explosive ordnance disposal experimental and research work took place) when it detonated. He died of shrapnel and blast injuries at Oldchurch Hospital the same day.|$|E
5000|$|The episode [...] "Butterfly Winter" [...] of Danger UXB {{revolves}} around a German airstrike {{on a small}} farming village that scattered butterfly bombs all through {{the town and the}} surrounding countryside. Excellent descriptions of the types of bomb fuses are given, as well as practical depictions of the ingenuity of the bomb disposal units in dealing with them. Significantly, as 347 Section leaves the town after it has been declared bomb-free, a <b>butterfly</b> <b>bomb</b> is shown hanging from a tree branch as their lorries drive past.|$|E
50|$|As {{with more}} modern cluster bombs, {{it was not}} {{considered}} practical to disarm butterfly bombs which had fully armed themselves but failed to detonate. This was because SD2 fuzes were deliberately designed to be extremely difficult and dangerous to render safe once they had armed themselves. Instead, the standard render safe procedure for any unexploded SD2 <b>butterfly</b> <b>bomb</b> was to evacuate the area for at least 30 minutes (in case the bomblet was fitted with a type 67 time delay fuze), then surround it with a ring of sandbags (to cushion the explosion) and destroy it in situ by detonating a small explosive charge beside it. Other solutions were to attach a long string to the bomb and tug on it after taking cover, or for bombs in open countryside, shooting at them with a rifle from a safe distance.|$|E

50|$|Luftwaffe Tactics: Allows {{the player}} to deploy Wirbelwind flakpanzers, Henschel Hs 129 and Fallschirmjäger. Luftwaffe ground forces install Flakvierling and FlaK 88 turrets, and can blanket areas with <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Bombs</b> (with Type 70 fuses). Players using this {{doctrine}} also receive advanced repair {{even if the}} player has not researched the skill yet. This allows them to repair vehicles far faster than the standard Panzergrenadiers.|$|R
50|$|Not all unexploded SD2 <b>butterfly</b> <b>bombs</b> {{still have}} their wings attached. In some cases the wings have rusted away and fallen off. The SD2 then resembles a rusty tin can with an {{aluminium}} disc (the fuze) in its side, sometimes with a short stub projecting from it. Regardless of age and condition, all unexploded SD2s remain highly sensitive to disturbance and can easily detonate.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Bomb</b> (or Sprengbombe Dickwandig 2 kg or SD2) was a German 2 {{kilogram}} anti-personnel submunition {{used by the}} Luftwaffe {{during the}} Second World War. It was so named because the thin cylindrical metal outer shell which hinged open when the bomblet deployed gave it the superficial appearance of a large butterfly. The design was very distinctive and easy to recognise. SD2 bomblets were not dropped individually, but were packed into containers holding between 6 and 108 submunitions e.g. the AB 23 SD-2 and AB 250-3 submunition dispensers. The SD2 submunitions were released after the container {{was released from the}} aircraft and had burst open. Because SD2s were always dropped in groups (never individually) the discovery of one unexploded SD2 was a reliable indication that others had been dropped nearby. This bomb type {{was one of the first}} cluster bombs ever used in combat and it proved to be a highly effective weapon. The bomb containers that carried the SD2 bomblets and released them in the air were nicknamed the [...] "Devil's Eggs" [...] by Luftwaffe air and ground crew.|$|E

50|$|<b>Butterfly</b> <b>bombs</b> in a submunitions {{container}} {{could have}} a mixture of different fuzes fitted to increase disruption to the target. Additionally, when a single fuze type with two operating functions was fitted (e.g. type 41), bombs in a submunitions container could have either or both possible fuze settings selected by the Luftwaffe ground crew. Fuze variants such as the 41A, 41B, 70B1, 70B2, etc., also existed. These variants were inserted into the fuze pocket via a bayonet fitting (the fuze was held in place via two steel clips) but otherwise functioned identically.|$|R
50|$|The Luftwaffe was {{particularly}} weak in this sector, but tried {{to support the}} attack {{with a few of}} the rare daylight appearances it made on D-Day. Generalfeldmarschall Hugo Sperrle, commanding Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3) was responsible for the air defence of Normandy and ordered all available forces to attack the beachhead. Junkers Ju 88s from Kampfgeschwader 54 (KG 54: Bomber Wing 54) attacked British positions with <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Bombs.</b> III./KG 54 struck Lion-sur-Mer while I./KG 54 bombed shipping {{at the mouth of the}} Orne.

50|$|American {{personnel}} {{losses were}} light due to adequate warning {{and the network}} of slit trenches distant from the aircraft parking area. Russian losses were much higher since work crews were ordered to fight fires and disable anti-personnel bombs while the raid was ongoing. <b>Butterfly</b> <b>bombs</b> continued to explode on the field for many weeks thereafter. Red Air Force losses included 15 Yak-9s, 6 Yak-7s, three trainers, a Hawker Hurricane, and a VIP DC-3. Soviet anti-aircraft fire was intense but random, and perversely served to outline {{the field for the}} German aircraft. There are conflicting reports about whether Soviet aircraft engaged the enemy, but since there was no radar intercept capability, even American fighters would have been ineffective.|$|R
50|$|The SD2 {{submunition}} was a 76 mm long cylinder of cast iron, {{which was}} slightly larger in diameter before its wings deployed. A steel cable 121 mm long was attached via a spindle to an aluminium fuze screwed into the fuze pocket {{in the side}} of the bomblet. The outer shell was hinged and would flip open as two half-cylinders when it was dropped. Additionally, spring-loaded wings at the ends would flip out. The wings at the end were canted at an angle to the airflow, which turned the spindle (connected to the fuze) anti-clockwise as the bomblet fell. After the spindle had revolved approximately 10 times (partially unscrewing itself from the bomb) it released a spring-loaded pin inside the fuze, which fully armed the SD2 bomb. The wings and arming spindle remained attached to the bomb after the fuze had armed itself, as the bomb descended towards the ground. <b>Butterfly</b> <b>bombs</b> contained the kleine Zündladung 34 (kl. Zdlg. 34/Np with a blasting cap and 7 grams of Nitropenta) booster and the main explosive filling consisting of 225 grams of cast Füllpulver 60/40 (Amatol) explosive. The fragmentation density produced by an SD 2 was 1 fragment per m² in 8 meters radius from a ground burst SD 2 bomb; overall, the body of an SD 2 did produce about 250 fragments with a mass of over 1 gram and a still greater number of lighter fragments. The fragments were generally lethal to anyone within a radius of 10 m and could inflict serious fragmentation injuries (e.g. deep penetrating eye wounds) as far away as 100 m. <b>Butterfly</b> <b>bombs</b> were usually painted either straw yellow (desert camouflage), or, if fitted with the DoppZ (41) or (41) A fuze, dark green or grey.|$|R
50|$|The Gruppen were {{rushed to}} Juvincourt Airfield on 6 June 1944, {{due to the}} Normandy landings. I./KG 54 {{operated}} against the British beachheads with <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Bombs</b> and mined the Orne and Vire estuaries on 7/8 June 1944. It mined the Seine bay on 8/9 June. I./KG 54 used fragmentation bombs against Arromanches and Lion-sur-Mer on 9/10 June.It bombed Sainte-Mère-Église on 10/11 June and had lost 13 machines by the 11 June. It flew some air drop missions on 12 June, but until 18 flew attacks against invasion shipping using PC 1000s, BM 1000s, and LT 350s. Subordinated to IX Fliegerkorps, it had only nine combat ready aircraft from 16 on 15 June. On 26 June it was moved to Orleans-Bricy to avoid Allied tactical aviation. It was moved to Eindhoven on 10 July and flew mainly mining operations from 25 July to 14 August 1944. It reported 13 bombers in July. It did flew some long-range operations to support the German Army in the Battle of Saint-Lô on 27/28, and 29/30 July. From 4-10 August it flew support operations in the Avranches area to assist the 5th Panzer Division. From 11 August to 19th, the Gruppe flew attacks against Allied forced breaking out of Normandy (beginning with Operation Cobra) and more mining operations. It suffered 11 losses in August. I./KG 54 was withdrawn to Giebelstadt on 22 August and began conversion to the Messerschmitt Me 262. It was redesignated I./KG (J) 54 on 1 October 1944.|$|R
50|$|On 5 July 1943 II./KG 55 {{carried out}} attacks against Soviet {{positions}} with <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Bombs.</b> A they bombed Gremuchiy and Gostishchevo, which the 51st Guards Rifle Division held from the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf, 12 Yak-1 fighters from the 27 IAP and 10 Lavochkin La-7s from 41 GAP attacked and shot down two Heinkels, and damaged a third. The SS unit {{managed to take}} the first objective. From 5, 8 and 9 July it bombed targets around Belgorod. II./KG 55 flew two missions on the 9 July and lost at least one bomber and one damaged in combat with Soviet fighters and after being engaged by strong anti-aircraft fire. Its own bases were targeted on 18 and 20 July. The group bombed Marinovka on 24 July, before relocating to Dnepropetrovsk on 6 August 1943. Beevka (7 August), Surkaya-Kamensk (17 August), and targets in and around Kalinovka (20 August) were carried out as the Red Army embarked on the Belgorod-Khar'kov Offensive Operation.III. Gruppe were also active but less is known about their operations. On 6 July it struck at Kharkov-Rogan, Novo-Donbad on 17 July, moved to Dnepropetrovsk 4 August, to Zaporozhye 25 August. It carried out attacks on Belgorod on 6 August Narodok (7 August), Belgorod again (9 August), Svoboda (18 August) and particularly heavy air attacks on Kuibyshevo in Volgograd Oblast, from 20-31 August 1943. The group moved to Stalino against on 28, 29 August. It bombed Federovka on 31 August. Major Alfred Bollmann succeeded Antrup to become the last commander of the group on 8 August 1943.|$|R
5000|$|Anti-handling {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} used in fuzes since at least 1940, in, for example, Luftwaffe's ZUS-40 anti-removal fuze [...] which was used during the London Blitz and elsewhere. ZUS-40s were designed to fit underneath most Luftwaffe bomb fuzes. When a delayed-action bomb containing a ZUS-40 was dropped on a target, the impact when it hit the ground freed a ball-bearing inside the ZUS-40, thereby arming a spring-loaded firing pin. However, so long as the main bomb fuze remained inside its fuze well, the cocked firing pin in the ZUS-40 was prevented from springing forward. ZUS-40s were often fitted underneath a type 17 clockwork long delay fuze, which gave between 2 and 72 hours delayed detonation. Rendering safe a type 17 fuze was normally a simple and straightforward process i.e. unscrew the fuze locking ring, remove the fuze from its pocket {{in the side of the}} bomb and unscrew the gaine. However, fitting a ZUS-40 underneath a type 17 fuze made the render-safe process much more complicated and dangerous. Removing the main time-delay fuze more than 15 millimetres from its fuze pocket (without neutralising the anti-handling device underneath) automatically released the cocked firing pin inside the ZUS-40, which sprang forward to strike a large percussion cap, thereby causing detonation of the bomb and the death of anyone nearby. Because the ZUS-40 was designed to be concealed underneath a conventional bomb fuze, it was very difficult to know whether a particular bomb was fitted with an anti-handling device or not. In any case, many electrically fired German bomb fuzes already had a pendulum-based [...] "trembler" [...] switch which triggered detonation if the bomb was subjected to rough handling. Some German anti-handling fuzes were even more dangerous to EOD personnel, such as the type 50 and 50BY fuzes. These were normally fitted to 250/500 kg bombs and contained two mercury tilt switches which detected vertical or horizontal movement. The fuzes fully armed themselves approximately 30 seconds after hitting the ground. Subsequently, if the bomb was moved in any way, the mercury switch triggered detonation. To complicate matters still further, German bombs could have two separate fuze pockets fitted, with different fuze types screwed into each one. As a result, one bomb could incorporate two separate anti-handling devices working independently of each other e.g. a type 17 clockwork fuze with a ZUS-40 hidden underneath it screwed into one fuze pocket, and a type 50BY in the other. Even comparatively small air-dropped munitions could incorporate an anti-handling feature e.g. the type 70 fuze fitted to <b>Butterfly</b> <b>bombs.</b> However, fuzes with an integral anti-handling feature were not only found in air-dropped bombs. For example, the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze (dating from 1943) fitted to Teller mines automatically triggered detonation if (in an attempt to render the mine safe) the pressure plate was unscrewed. Although the designs of these anti-handling fuzes varied, all were specifically designed to kill bomb disposal personnel who had the task of rendering them safe.|$|R
