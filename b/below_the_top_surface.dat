Φ 500 PHC is widely used as an engineering design pile in the Yangtze River Delta region.

The studies show that, the distribution of bending moment and shear is significant in 2 ~ 4 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of the pile, and after 6 m, the value of them closes to 0. The main sphere of influence of the single pile bending moment and shear is concentrated at 3 ~ 4 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of the pile.

40|$|Using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, we {{considered}} {{the impact of}} the flexoelectro-chemical coupling on the size effects inpolar properties and phase transitions of thin ferroelectric films with a layer of elastic defects. We investigated a typical case, when defects fill a thin layer <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> film <b>surface</b> with a constant concentration creating an additional gradient of elastic fields. The defective surface of the film is not covered with an electrode, but instead with an ultra-thin layer of ambient screening charges, characterized by a surface screening length. This geometry is typical for the scanning probe piezoelectric force microscopy. Obtained results revealed an unexpectedly strong effect of the joint action of Vegard stresses and flexoelectric effect (shortly flexo-chemical coupling) on the ferroelectric transition temperature, distribution of the spontaneous polarization and elastic fields, domain wall structure and period in thin PbTiO 3 films containing a layer of elastic defects. A nontrivial result is the ferroelectricity persisting at film thicknesses below 4 nm, temperatures lower than 350 K and relatively high surface screening length (~ 0. 1 nm). The origin of this phenomenon is the re-building of the domain structure in the film (namely the cross-over from c-domain stripes to a-type closure domains) when its thickness decreases below 4 nm, conditioned by the flexoelectric coupling and facilitated by negative Vegard effect. For positive Vegard effect, thicker films exhibit the appearance of pronounced maxima on the thickness dependence of the transition temperature, whose position and height can be controlled by the defect type and concentration. The revealed features may have important implications for miniaturization of ferroelectric-based devices. Comment: 25 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractElectrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM) is a competitive process to machine difficult-to-cut materials, but thermal damage {{is a critical}} concern for the EDMed parts. Finite element modeling provides insight into the thermal damage mechanism in EDM processes. However, current modeling approaches of an EDM process are limited to a single discharge, which is far from reality to predict thermal damage due to the accumulating effect of massive random. In this study, an innovative modeling approach to account for massive random discharges has been developed based on the stochastic EDM process and probability theory. Die sinking EDM of NiTi alloys was simulated to investigate the thermal damage mechanism with the progression of massive random discharges. The temperature history profiles of both top surface and subsurface showed pulsing characteristics with the progression of massive random discharges, which resulted from high-frequency random discharging phenomenon. A large temperature gradient was also found on the area <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>surface,</b> while it gradually decreased in the deep subsurface.

At 10 - 4 Torr of O 2 and 23 °C, titanium was oxidized preferentially while nickel remained in the metallic form even after 40 min of exposure.

40|$|The rate of {{oxidation}} {{is important}} to the long-term performance of reducing salt waste forms because the solubility of some contaminants, e. g., technetium, is a function of oxidation state. TcO{sub 4 }{sup −} in the salt solution is reduced to Tc(IV) and has been shown to react with ingredients in the waste form to precipitate low solubility sulfide and/or oxide phases. Upon exposure to oxygen, the compounds containing Tc(IV) oxidize to the pertechnetate ion, Tc(VII) O{sub 4 }{sup −}, which is very soluble. Consequently the rate of technetium oxidation front advancement into a monolith and the technetium leaching profile as a function of depth from an exposed surface are important to waste form performance and ground water concentration predictions. An approach for measuring contaminant oxidation rate (effective contaminant specific oxidation rate) based on leaching of select contaminants of concern is described in this report. In addition, the relationship between reduction capacity and contaminant oxidation is addressed. Chromate (Cr(VI) was used as a non-radioactive surrogate for pertechnetate, Tc(VII), in Cast Stone samples prepared with 5 M Simulant. Cast Stone spiked with pertechnetate was also prepared and tested. Depth discrete subsamples spiked with Cr were cut from Cast Stone exposed to Savannah River Site (SRS) outdoor ambient temperature fluctuations and moist air. Depth discrete subsamples spiked with Tc- 99 were cut from Cast Stone exposed to laboratory ambient temperature fluctuations and moist air. Similar conditions are expected to be encountered in the Cast Stone curing container. The leachability of Cr and Tc- 99 and the reduction capacities, measured by the Angus-Glasser method, were determined for each subsample as a function of depth from the exposed surface. The results obtained to date were focused on continued method development and are preliminary and apply to the sample composition and curing / exposure conditions described in this report. The Cr oxidation front (depth to which soluble Cr was detected) for the Cast Stone sample exposed for 68 days to ambient outdoor temperatures and humid air (total age of sample was 131 days) was determined to be about 35 mm <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> sample <b>surface</b> exposed. <b>The</b> Tc oxidation front, depth at which Tc was insoluble, was not determined. Interpretation of the results indicates that the oxidation front is at least 38 mm <b>below</b> <b>the</b> exposed surface. The sample used for this measurement was exposed to ambient laboratory conditions and humid air for 50 days. The total age of the sample was 98 days. Technetium appears to be more easily oxidized than Cr in the Cast Stone matrix. The oxidized forms of Tc and Cr are soluble and therefore leachable. Longer exposure times are required for both the Cr and Tc spiked samples to better interpret the rate of oxidation. Tc spiked subsamples need to be taken further from the exposed surface to better define and interpret the leachable Tc profile. Finally Tc(VII) reduction to Tc(IV) appears to occur relatively fast. Results demonstrated that about 95 percent of the Tc(VII) was reduced to Tc(IV) during the setting and very early stage setting for a Cast Stone sample cured 10 days. Additional testing at longer curing times is required to determine whether additional time is required to reduce 100 % of the Tc(VII) in Cast Stone or whether the Tc loading exceeded the ability of the waste form to reduce 100 % of the Tc(VII). Additional testing is required for samples cured for longer times. Depth discrete subsampling in a nitrogen glove box is also required to determine whether the 5 percent Tc extracted from the subsamples {{was the result of the}} sampling process which took place in air. Reduction capacity measurements (per the Angus-Glasser method) performed on depth discrete samples could not be correlated with the amount of chromium or technetium leached from the depth discrete subsamples or with the oxidation front inferred from soluble chromium and technetium (i. e., effective Cr and Tc oxidation fronts). Residual reduction capacity in the oxidized region of the test samples indicates that the remaining reduction capacity is not effective in re-reducing Cr(VI) or Tc(VII) in the presence of oxygen. Depth discrete sampling and leaching is a useful for evaluating Cast Stone and other chemically reducing waste forms containing ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) or other reduction / sequestration reagents to control redox sensitive contaminant chemistry and leachability in the near surface disposal environment. Based on results presented in this report, reduction capacity measured by the Angus-Glasser Ce(IV) method is not an appropriate or meaningful parameter for determining or predicting Tc and Cr oxidation / retentions, speciation, or solubilities in cementitious materials such as Cast Stone. A model for predicting Tc(IV) oxidation to soluble Tc(VII) should consider the waste form porosity (pathway for oxygen ingress), oxygen source, and the contaminant specific oxidation rates and oxidation fronts. Depth discrete sampling of materials exposed to realistic conditions in combination with short term leaching of crushed samples has potential for advancing the understanding of factors influencing performance.

Here we report a computational study of Cd and Te adatom diffusion on the CdTe (111) A-type (Cd terminated) and B-type (Te terminated) surfaces and their migration paths. The atomic and electronic structure calculations are performed under the DFT formalism and climbing Nudge Elastic Band (cNEB) method has been applied to evaluate the potential barrier of the Te and Cd diffusion. In general the minimum energy site on the surface is labeled as Aa site. In case of Te and Cd on B-type surface, the sub-surface site (a site just <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>surface)</b> is very close in energy to the A site. This is responsible for the subsurface accumulation of adatoms and therefore, expected to influence the defect formation during growth. The diffusion process of adatoms is considered from Aa (occupied) to Aa (empty) site at the nearest distance. We have explored three possible migration paths for the adatom diffusion. The adatom surface interaction is highly dependent on the type of the surface. Typically, Te interaction with both type (5. 2 eV for A-type and 3. 8 eV for B-type) is stronger than Cd interactions(2. 4 eV for B-type and 0. 39 eV for A-type).

The conditions for this possible temporary melting are quantitatively described for bolometric albedo values A = 0. 8 and A = 0. 2, and with model parameters typical for the thermo-physical conditions at snow/ice sites on the surface of present Mars. It is demonstrated by numerical modelling that there are several sets of parameters which will lead to development of layers of liquid water just <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of snow- and ice-packs on Mars.

The creation of temporary pockets of sub-surface water by this effect requires pre-existing snow or ice cover, and thus is more likely to take place at high latitudes, since the present deposits of snow/ice can mainly be found there.

When the temperature at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> is higher than that at the bottom surface, tensile stress occurs at the bottom surface and induces downward curling of the four corners; when the temperature at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> is lower than that at the bottom surface, there will be tensile stress at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> and four corners will curl upward.|$|R
