25|$|Just as Wasp <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> {{the boat}} for the prize crew to go aboard Avon, Wasp's lookout sighted another British brig sailing toward Wasp and Avon. Wasps crew manned their battle {{stations}} immediately {{in hope of}} taking the newcomer, the 18-gun Castilian, as well. Just then, two more British ships appeared on the horizon. Wasp therefore sailed away, abandoning Avon.|$|E
25|$|Too {{badly damaged}} to continue, Pluton ran herself aground at 1045 {{on the beach}} just west of Cabanas Bay. Now alone, Furor survived only five more minutes. Still firing her guns, but with half her crew killed or wounded and clearly doomed, Furor stuck her colors and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> her boats; several American {{projectiles}} struck Spanish sailors struggling in the water before the Americans realized she had surrendered. Two American boats came alongside and began to take off survivors, but quickly pushed away again fearing an imminent magazine explosion, which promptly occurred. Furor sank about a mile offshore in deep water at 1050.|$|E

25|$|Merchant sailors {{were trained}} {{and used to}} man the {{anti-aircraft}} gun, it fired continually throughout the battle though it misfired a few times because of old ammunition. In fifteen minutes of fighting the Stanvac Calcutta was struck {{several times in the}} bridge and elsewhere, killing Captain Karlsson and a few other men. After hitting the Stier the guards manning the 4-inch gun were reported to have been encouraged and continued firing accurately until shrapnel damaged their weapon. The sights were destroyed but the Americans continued shooting until the ammunition on deck was exhausted. At this time Ensign Anderson ordered two men to retrieve more ammunition from below deck though as soon as they left, Captain Gerlach maneuvered his ship for a torpedo attack. When lined up, Stier fired one torpedo and it dove into the water and headed straight for Stanvac Calcutta where it detonated on the port side. Water began flowing in and the vessel started listing. A number of additional men were killed in the torpedo explosion and when {{it was clear that the}} American ship could not be saved, Ensign Anderson ordered the survivors to abandon ship and he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> life rafts.|$|E
500|$|After the {{formation}} of an eye, Kalunde continued to intensify rapidly and at 1800UTC March7 MFR declared the system an intense cyclone. Simultaneously, JTWC estimated that Kalunde had attained winds of [...] while located several hundred miles south-southwest of Diego Garcia. Continuing to trek southwest by a mid-level ridge to the southeast, the rapid intensification trend continued until it leveled off early on March8. At this time, the JTWC reported winds of , equivalent to Category 5 intensity on the SSHWS. Subsequently, MFR remarked that the system had reached its peak wind speed of , as an intense tropical cyclone. After attaining peak intensity, MFR and the JTWC <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> their intensity estimates as thunderstorms began to erode in the northwestern quadrant of the eyewall.|$|E
2500|$|Second, the {{environment}} in the low-lying coastal regions of northwestern Europe <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> c. 250 and gradually receded over the next 200 years. Tectonic subsidence, a rising water table and storm surges combined to flood some areas with marine transgressions. This was accelerated by a shift to a cooler, wetter climate in the region. If there had been any Frisii left in Frisia, they would have drowned.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1920s, as some {{elements}} within the AFL <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> these barriers, while groups {{as diverse as the}} Urban League, the Socialist Party of America and Communist Party began to focus on the rights of black workers. Randolph himself was a prominent member of the Socialist Party. From its inception, the BSCP fought to open doors in the organized labor movement in the US for black workers, even though it faced staunch opposition and blatant racism. [...] As BSCP co-founder and First Vice President Milton Price Webster, put it, [...] "...any time we have an American institution composed of white people there is prejudice in it....In America, if we should stay out of everything that's prejudiced we wouldn't be in anything." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{that there}} was danger of going {{down some of the}} sailors seemed to grow crazy. Half a dozen tumbled into one of the boats and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> it of their own accord.|$|E
60|$|He <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> {{himself into}} the hole, and his feet struck a flight of stone steps. Down this he sped and soon reached a narrow {{passageway}} lined with rough stone, from which the moisture oozed into pools at his feet.|$|E

60|$|On the 9th of May, {{the ships}} began to arrive. Among them were seven large vessels, which {{appeared}} to be old men-of-war. A large number of workmen immediately went on board them, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> the topmasts. This confirmed the news in respect to the floating batteries.|$|E
60|$|At length, when {{he thought}} they had reached a safe distance, he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> his flight, and {{gradually}} descending to earth, deposited his burden in a flowery meadow.

60|$|The weather, which up to {{that time}} had kept fine, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower,</b> and, just as the train started, a smart thunder-shower fell, but, being under cover, the holiday-makers heeded it not. Upon the whole they were an orderly band of excursionists. Some of the {{separate}} groups were teetotallers, and only one or two showed symptoms of having sought to increase their hilarity by the use of stimulants.|$|E
50|$|Arriving at {{the place}} on the Prometheus, they ring inside a hidden cavern where a {{hologram}} of Merlin tells them that only the true will {{gain access to the}} treasures of the Ancients. There is a sword in a stone, but Mitchell is unable to remove it. They decide to explore further; Daniel and Vala take a right passageway, and Mitchell and Teal'c take a left. Both parties find rooms which light up upon entry. In both rooms, the parties encounter puzzles, and the doors lock shut automatically. Just when they think it can't get any worse, the ceiling <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>to</b> crush them, and they must solve the puzzles in time before they are crushed.|$|R
50|$|Building {{upon the}} band's {{previous}} album Phase III, Crazy Horses was primarily hard rock in nature. It was cited by author Chuck Eddy {{as one of}} The Five Hundred Best Heavy Metal Albums in the Universe. It also saw a reduced vocal role for Donny Osmond, who as a preteen had been the group's co-lead singer but whose voice was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> because of puberty; Alan, Wayne and Jay each took portions of the lead vocals {{on some of the}} songs.|$|R
60|$|When all was ready, this man, {{still taking}} his last hurried charges from his comrades and the surgeon after the {{windlass}} had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> him, {{disappeared into the}} pit. The rope went out as before, the signal was made as before, and the windlass stopped. No man removed his hand from it now. Every one waited with his grasp set, and his body bent down to the work, ready to reverse and wind in. At length the signal was given, and all the ring leaned forward.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{went in to}} Mrs. Hargreaves' to see if {{he could}} be of any service, but there was {{comparatively}} little to do, for that lady had lost all her portable property in the destruction of the bungalow on the estate owned by her husband, and had come into Lucknow shortly before the outbreak, when the cloud <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> heavily, with but a small amount of baggage. Dick had not been able to see them since his first visit, being incessantly on duty.|$|E
60|$|Dick, {{blowing out}} his lamp lest it should attract attention, {{led the way}} up-stairs and along the corridor. In the brown chamber the rope had been made fast to the frame of an {{exceeding}} heavy and ancient bed. It had not been detached, and Dick, taking the coil to the window, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> it slowly and cautiously {{into the darkness of}} the night. Joan stood by; but as the rope lengthened, and still Dick continued to pay it out, extreme fear began to conquer her resolution.|$|E
60|$|He did so boldly enough, {{and swung}} {{out over the}} mouth of the pit, while the three of them {{clutched}} the handles of the winch. Then they <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower,</b> and slowly his white face disappeared into the black depth. At every few turns his descent was stopped that he might examine the walls of the well, and when he was about fifty feet down he called to them to hold on, which they did, listening while he struck at the rock with a hammer, for here it sounded very hollow.|$|E
60|$|Benson took it {{from him}} and slowly tied it to the candlestick. Then he {{placed it on the}} edge of the well, and {{striking}} a match, lit the candle and <b>began</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> it.|$|R

60|$|Again they went, {{but as they}} laded for {{the third}} time, the ends of ladders {{appeared}} above the encircling walls of the steps, and Syrians could be seen rushing out upon the portico, whence they <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> themselves with ropes. The end of that scene was dreadful. The boats were full, till the water indeed began to overflow their gunwales, but many still remained upon the steps or rushed into the water, women screaming and holding their children above their heads, and men thrusting them aside in the mad rush for life. The boats rowed off, some who could swim following them. For the rest, their end was the sword. In all, seventy souls were rescued.|$|E
60|$|Two hours later, the Sea Lion of Oyster Pond glanced {{through the}} passage which {{led into the}} ocean, on an ebb-tide. By that time, the other vessel had {{disappeared}} in the southern board; and Gardiner came out upon the open waters again, boldly, and certain of his course. All sail was set, and the little craft slipped away from the land with the ease of an aquatic bird, that is plying its web-feet. Studding-sails were set, and the pyramid of the Horn soon <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> in the distance, as the schooner receded. When night closed over the rolling waters, {{it was no longer}} visible, the vessel having fairly entered the Antarctic Ocean, if anything north of the circle can properly so be termed.|$|E
60|$|Things {{were in this}} state, {{the sheik}} and his guests {{communicating}} by signs, {{in such a way}} as completely to mystify each other; Mr. Monday drinking, Mr. Dodge conjecturing, and parties quitting the camp and arriving every ten minutes, when an Arab pointed eagerly with his finger in the direction of the wreck. The head of the foremast was slowly rising, and the look-out in the top was clinging to the spar, which began to cant, in order to keep himself from falling. The sheik affected to smile; but he was evidently disturbed, and two or three messengers were sent out into the camp. In the meanwhile, the spar <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower,</b> and was soon entirely concealed beneath the bank.|$|E
25|$|About 30 {{seconds before}} {{arriving}} at the crossing, the train trips a track circuit near the crossing, triggering the crossing signals. The lights <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> flash alternately, and a bell (or bells) mounted at the crossing begins ringing. After several seconds of flashing lights and ringing bells, the crossing gates (if equipped) <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower,</b> which usually takes 5–10 seconds. Some AWDs silence the bell once the gates are fully lowered (typically seen on most Norfolk Southern and CSX crossings); most continue ringing the bells throughout (Union Pacific, BNSF Railway). Some crossings will not sound the bell at all after dark in the case that it is installed near a residential area. The lights continue to flash throughout regardless.|$|R
5000|$|... 2. The Reverse 8 This move {{is exactly}} the {{opposite}} of the 8. The main hand starts at the starting position described earlier. The dancer begins raising his extended main hand to his side creating a big circle. As the sieve reaches the top point of the circle (above the dancer's head) the dancer <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> his main hand to complete the circle. Once the circle is almost complete the dancer <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> folding his angle and twist his wrist inwards his body, continuing the circle movement. The sieve passes beneath his armpit and the dancer finishes the move at starting position. This move is significantly harder than the basic 8.|$|R
