5|$|At the RV park, Mulder finds Ronnie. As {{he tries}} to arrest him, Mulder is {{surrounded}} and overwhelmed {{by a group of}} people with glowing green eyes. He wakes up the next morning in the RV park, in his car, where he is rejoined by Scully. They are both unharmed and the vampires have disappeared. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> they give their unified report to Skinner, who is dumbfounded by what he has heard.|$|E
5|$|<b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., Mulder {{introduces}} Scully to the Lone Gunmen, {{a trio of}} eccentric {{conspiracy theorists}} with whom he collaborates. After returning to FBI headquarters, Scully discovers a surveillance device within her pen. Mulder meets with Deep Throat, who provides him with documentation of an intercepted Iraqi transmission regarding the downed UFO. Scully continues to investigate the Tennessee incident, learning that two thousand pounds of extra weight had been added to Ranheim's truck. She also learns Ranheim's true identity as Frank Druce.|$|E
5|$|<b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} believe their claims. McGrath offers an {{especially}} harsh reprimand to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found in}} a cargo container. McGrath and his disciplinary board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be more dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E

5|$|Ruby is then {{seen in a}} {{hospital}} bed, with Kevin by her side. When questioned about her experience, {{she says she was}} told by an unnamed group not to say anything. Darlene also refuses to cooperate any further, given the ridicule that she faced after her experiences. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> Scully listens to a tape of hypnotic sessions in which Mulder recalls the night his sister vanished. Mulder, meanwhile, sits in a church, crying as he looks at a picture of his sister.|$|E
5|$|As a student, Kincaid showed {{exceptional}} {{aptitude for}} the natural sciences and achieved national attention for his scientific achievements. In 1897, while still an undergraduate, he accompanied David Starr Jordan to the Pribilof Islands {{as part of a}} study of seals undertaken by the American Fur Seal Commission. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> Kincaid's interests focused more on insect life, and a report that year in the Boston Evening Transcript noted that he had discovered 41 new species of bees, including 22 of the genus Osmia. Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, at the time one of America's leading entomologists, directed a portion of the sizable Kincaid bee collection to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Smith briefly {{returned}} to the United States in June 1945. In August, Eisenhower nominated Smith as his successor as commander of U.S. Forces, European Theater, as ETOUSA was redesignated on 1 July 1945. Smith was passed over in favor of General Joseph McNarney. When Eisenhower took over as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in November 1945, he summoned Smith to become his Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations and Planning. However, soon after his arrival <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> he was asked by President Harry S. Truman and U.S Secretary of State James F. Byrnes to become the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union. In putting Smith's nomination for the post before the United States Senate, Truman asked for and received special legislation permitting Smith to retain his permanent military rank of major general.|$|E

50|$|Dave Foster is an American {{musician}} {{who was the}} third drummer for the grunge rock band Nirvana. He was fired after playing {{only a couple of}} performances with the band, mostly because of his inability to attend rehearsal sessions regularly. Foster lived hours away from Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Aberdeen, <b>Washington,</b> which required the men to pick Foster up and bring him to the band's rehearsal space in Tacoma. Based on Cobain's own account, this made band practices complicated.|$|R

5|$|By 1965, the Americans {{were looking}} for someone to {{overthrow}} Khánh, and these efforts were spearheaded by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, who had begun encouraging other senior officers to move against Khánh {{since the start of the}} year, even though there was still significant hesitation and opposition to any regime change <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> At the time, the US was planning to start a large-scale bombing campaign against the communist north and regarded Khánh's reliance on Buddhist support as an obstacle to their aims. Furthermore, Taylor and Khánh developed an intense personal antipathy for one another, which culminated in a breakdown in their relationship; in December 1964, Khánh's junta deposed the High National Council, a civilian advisory body that was designed to give a semblance of civilian rule. This resulted in Taylor angrily condemning Khánh and his generals in private to the point of suggesting Khánh resign the leadership. Khánh responded by threatening to expel Taylor, and going on a media offensive against the ambassador. Taylor threatened to withhold military aid, but the Americans could not do so because of their overriding desire to see the military defeat of the communists, and without foreign funding, South Vietnam could not survive.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of newly {{appointed}} Treasury Secretary John C. Spencer, Tyler cleared out an array of officeholders, replacing them with pro-annexation partisans, in a reversal of his former stand against patronage. He elicited {{the help of}} political organizer Michael Walsh to build a political machine in New York. In exchange for an appointment as consul to Hawaii, journalist Alexander G. Abell wrote a flattering biography, Life of John Tyler, which was printed in large quantities and given to postmasters to distribute. Seeking to rehabilitate his public image, Tyler embarked on a nationwide tour {{in the spring of}} 1843. The positive reception of the public at these events contrasted with his ostracism <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> The tour centered on the dedication of the Bunker Hill Monument in Boston, Massachusetts. Shortly after the dedication, Tyler learned of Legaré's sudden death, which dampened the festivities and caused him to cancel the rest of the tour.|$|E

50|$|After {{coming out}} as a trans woman, Keisling moved home to Pennsylvania where she became a {{dedicated}} transgender rights activist. She first co-chaired the Pennsylvania Gender Rights Coalition, during which time she recognized {{the need for a}} professional activist presence <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> for transgender people. She moved to <b>back</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> 2002 and, {{with the support of the}} National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, established the National Center for Transgender Equality in 2003.|$|R
50|$|After the war, Harlow {{returned}} to Oklahoma City twice {{to serve as}} vice president of Harlow Publishing Company in 1946-47 and 1951-52, but both times, he was recruited <b>back</b> to positions <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> <b>In</b> 1947, he joined the staff of the House Armed Services Committee, and in 1948, he became the head of the staff. In 1950, he became disenchanted with the Democratic Party and switched his registration to Republican.|$|R

In Cincinnati she beat an in-form Alizé Cornet, before pushing Maria Sharapova to three sets in the second round.

25|$|Although York was the Provincial {{capital of}} Upper Canada, {{it was far}} less {{important}} than Kingston as a military objective. Armstrong, by now <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> nevertheless acquiesced in this change of plan as Dearborn might well have better local information. Historians such as John R. Elting {{have pointed out that}} this effectively reversed Armstrong's original strategy. Also, by committing the bulk of the American forces at the western end of Lake Ontario, it would leave Sackett's Harbor vulnerable to an attack by British reinforcements arriving from Lower Canada.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> DC during October 1950, Army Chief of Staff General J. Lawton Collins {{submitted}} a memorandum to his Air Force counterpart, General Hoyt Vandenberg outlining Army complaints with the forward air control system and plumping for parceling {{close air support}} aircraft to its divisions. A month later, General Almond reported from Korea; his requests for improvements echoed that of Collins. During the same time frame, an Air Force team headed by General Glenn O. Barcus noted that the army's nonparticipation in the JOC hobbled close air support efforts. The Barcus report also contained suggestions to improve the Air Force participation in CAS.|$|E
25|$|Greenleaf was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., in December 1794. He became {{acquainted with}} Thomas Law, a wealthy British {{merchant}} newly arrived in America. Law {{was the son}} of Edmund Law, the Bishop of Carlisle. His brother John Law was Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh and Bishop of Killala and Achonry, and in 1795 was named Bishop of Elphin. His brother Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough, served as Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales from 1802 to 1818. Another brother, George Henry Law, became Bishop of Chester in 1812 and Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1824. Thomas Law spent many years in India, where he made a fortune in trade.|$|E

50|$|In 1851, Allegheny was towed to Portsmouth, Virginia, {{where the}} firm of Mehaffy and Company removed her Hunter Wheels and rebuilt her as a screw steamer.

25|$|Helms {{began his}} career in {{intelligence}} by serving in the war-time Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Following the allied victory Helms was stationed in Germany, serving under Allen Dulles and Frank Wisner. Then in late 1945 President Truman terminated the OSS. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> Helms continued in similar intelligence work {{as part of the}} Strategic Services Unit (SSU), which later became called the Office of Special Operations (OSO). Helms focused then on espionage in central Europe {{at the start of the}} Cold War, and his work included the vetting of the German Gehlen spy organization. When the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was founded in 1947, the OSO was incorporated into the new agency.|$|E
25|$|On the pitch, things {{continued}} fairly brightly for the team, which {{finished the}} month atop both the Eastern Conference and overall MLS standings based on most points per game. Despite squandering second-half leads {{at home against}} both the New York Red Bulls and the Houston Dynamo, United did not lose in April. Against New York, DC, took a 2–0 lead {{on a pair of}} goals by Perry Kitchen. The Red Bulls came back to get a point, culminating the comeback as Lloyd Sam knocked in a rebound when Hamid could not control a Sacha Kljestan free kick. In the next match, against the Dynamo, United's Chris Rolfe scored on a free kick from almost the same spot that the Red Bulls took their game-tying free-kick in the previous match. Once again, though, the defense failed to prevent a late goal on a tap-in following a rebound allowed by the DC goalie, This time it was Andrew Dykstra who was in the net, unable to prevent the tying goal. After the successive disappointing home draws, DC United finished the month with a surprising win in Vancouver, a first ever for the franchise. The Whitecaps opened the scoring in that match with a goal on their first foray forward, but DC responded with a goal by Bobby Boswell to knot the score. Just before halftime, Fabian Espindola, drew a foul along with a second yellow card for Whitecaps player, Matias Laba. Espindola was making his MLS season debut after serving a 6-game suspension. Playing with a man-advantage, United took the lead in the second half on a goal by Chris Rolfe. Defending the lead was made more challenging when goalie Andrew Dykstra injured his ankle and had to be subbed off. Dykstra was playing because Bill Hamid was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> missing his second straight match, nursing a thigh injury. Rookie Travis Worra came on to make his MLS debut, manning the goal as United held on for a 2–1 win.|$|E

50|$|<b>Back</b> <b>in</b> 1785, George <b>Washington</b> {{signed a}} {{certificate}} that admitted Dale into the Society of the Cincinnati, which honored officer {{veterans of the}} Revolutionary War.

He was also active in the Society for the Relief of Poor and Distressed Masters of Ships, Their Wives and Children (est. 1765), and served <b>in</b> the <b>Washington</b> Benevolent Society of Pennsylvania. During the War of 1812, he was a member of the General Committee, formed to protect Philadelphia from potential attack by the British military.|$|R

Days later, Burns is <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Seattle, <b>Washington,</b> preparing to leave his current identity, hoping to escape both Mason and the legal responsibilities resulting from the disastrous hunt. But Mason has escaped the forest, returned to the city and tracked him down. A quick fight ensues, but Mason chooses not to kill him. Instead he walks away, but Burns attempts to shoot Mason <b>in</b> the <b>back.</b> Taking to heart a lesson he learned from Hank, Mason had blocked the barrel with cigarettes of Burns's gun and it backfires on the man, killing him as Mason walks out into the dark.|$|R
500|$|<b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird and the Joint Chiefs {{tried to}} refute claims by reporters that the South Vietnamese advance had stalled.

500|$|<b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> a {{reorganization}} of units created the Army of Virginia under Maj. Gen. John Pope, who {{was directed to}} advance toward Richmond from the northeast. McClellan resisted calls to reinforce Pope's army and delayed return of the Army of the Potomac from the Peninsula enough so that the reinforcements arrived while the Northern Virginia Campaign was already underway. He wrote to his wife before the battle, [...] "Pope will be thrashed ... & be disposed of [...] ... Such a villain as he is ought to bring defeat upon any cause that employs him." [...] Lee had assessed McClellan's defensive nature and gambled on removing significant units from the Peninsula to attack Pope, who was beaten decisively at Second Bull Run in August.|$|E
50|$|Some {{methods of}} shunpiking may be quicker than taking toll roads. Perhaps the best-known example is long-distance through traffic for Interstate 70, which for 86 mi runs {{concurrent}} with Interstate 76 along the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Westbound travelers can exit I-70 in Maryland {{just south of}} the Pennsylvania border and enter Interstate 68, continuing along I-68's entire length through western Maryland and into West Virginia until arriving at Interstate 79, I-68's western terminus, in Morgantown. After merging onto I-79 north, a traveler can enter Pennsylvania and merge <b>back</b> onto I-70 <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> Pennsylvania, where I-70 and I-79 are briefly concurrent.|$|R

He was dismissed in August 1995. Between November 1995 and December 1996, Wolf was the guest host of The Tony Kornheiser Show on Thursdays on WTEM and sometimes he also flew to New York as a substitute sports anchor on Imus in the Morning when the regular sports anchor, Mike Breen, was away. Because of his work on Imus in the Morning and Don Imus' recommendation on the air continuously, Wolf went back to WCBS-TV as the sports anchor on February 3, 1997 (the most recent of his replacements at WCBS, Bernie Smilovitz, had returned to WDIV in Detroit after having been caught in WCBS' infamous 1996 mass firings).|$|R
