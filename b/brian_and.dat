The real <b>Brian</b> <b>and</b> Stewie then travel by plane to Vegas. As the duplicated pair check into the Bellagio hotel, their luck makes itself present immediately with the duplicated Brian winning a large jackpot at the slot machines near the entrance.

During his parole hearing, he {{references}} the court case Plessy v. Ferguson, but unfortunately for him, the council believes that it's stupid to listen to a dog. Just when Brian is about to be dismissed, Peter steps in and delivers a last-ditch emotional appeal on his behalf. The city council members remain unmoved until Peter bribes them with $20 each, and Brian is immediately freed. The charges against him are finally dropped and the town shows him new respect, allowing him to finally drink out of a water fountain, showing his status to be {{the same as that of}} the other citizens of the community.
