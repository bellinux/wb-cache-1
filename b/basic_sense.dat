Lack of preparation in diplomatic protocol, cultural norms, culinary skills and restroom etiquette makes them prone to committing faux-pas to the embarrassment of their hosts, muted helplessness of embassy staff and amusement of the press-corps.

25|$|Drug design, often {{referred}} to as rational drug design or simply rational design, is the inventive process of finding new medications based on the knowledge of a biological target. The drug is most commonly an organic small molecule that activates or inhibits the function of a biomolecule such as a protein, which in turn results in a therapeutic benefit to the patient. In the most <b>basic</b> <b>sense,</b> drug design involves the design of molecules that are complementary in shape and charge to the biomolecular target with which they interact and therefore will bind to it. Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer modeling techniques. This type of modeling is sometimes referred to as computer-aided drug design. Finally, drug design that relies on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecular target is known as structure-based drug design. In addition to small molecules, biopharmaceuticals and especially therapeutic antibodies are an increasingly important class of drugs and computational methods for improving the affinity, selectivity, and stability of these protein-based therapeutics have also been developed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the most}} <b>basic</b> <b>sense,</b> {{headlight}} flashing {{is a way}} of attracting attention, for any of a number of purposes.

[...] This equivalency is underscored by some car owner's manuals, which identify the steering column control lever which allows headlight flashing as the [...] "optical horn". Headlight flashing can be used simply to let other drivers know of one's presence, or as a response to acknowledge the presence or actions of other drivers. Some drivers flash their headlights as a signal that they are yielding the right of way to another driver, for example at an intersection controlled by stop signs.|$|E
2500|$|In {{its most}} <b>basic</b> <b>sense,</b> {{multimodality}} {{is a theory}} of communication and social semiotics. Multimodality describes communication practices {{in terms of the}} textual, aural, linguistic, spatial, and visual resources - or modes - used to compose messages. [...] Where media are concerned, multimodality is the use of several modes (media) to create a single artifact. The collection of these modes, or elements, contributes to how multimodality affects different rhetorical situations, or opportunities for increasing an audience's reception of an idea or concept. [...] Everything from the placement of images to the organization of the content creates meaning. This {{is the result of a}} shift from isolated text being relied on as the primary source of communication, to the image being utilized more frequently in the digital age. [...] While multimodality as an area of academic study did not gain traction until the twentieth century, all communication, literacy, and composing practices are and always have been multimodal.|$|E
2500|$|Besides liberty, {{liberals have}} {{developed}} several other principles {{important to the}} construction of their philosophical structure, such as equality, pluralism, and toleration. Highlighting the confusion over the first principle, Voltaire commented, [...] "equality is at once the most natural and at times the most chimeral of things." [...] All forms of liberalism assume, in some <b>basic</b> <b>sense,</b> that individuals are equal. In maintaining that people are naturally equal, liberals assume that they all possess the same right to liberty. In other words, no one is inherently entitled to enjoy the benefits of liberal society more than anyone else, and all people are equal subjects before the law. Beyond this basic conception, liberal theorists diverge on their understanding of equality. American philosopher John Rawls emphasised the need to ensure not only equality under the law, but also the equal distribution of material resources that individuals required to develop their aspirations in life. Libertarian thinker Robert Nozick disagreed with Rawls, championing the former version of Lockean equality instead.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with all}} the speeches {{reported}} by Thucydides, the resemblance between Cleon's and Diodotus' speeches as the historian recorded them and the speeches actually given {{has been the subject}} of much debate. [...] In the famous passage where he lays out his methodology for reporting the content of speeches, Thucydides states that [...] "my habit has been to make the speakers say what was in my opinion demanded of them by the various occasions, of course adhering as closely as possible to the general sense of what they really said." [...] Various historians have either stressed the first clause of this sentence and reached the conclusion that Thucydides put words into his speakers' mouths or emphasized the second clause and concluded that Thucydides' speeches maintain the <b>basic</b> <b>sense</b> of the speeches actually given on the various occasions he describes.
