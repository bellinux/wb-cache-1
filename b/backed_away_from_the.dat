5|$|Despite United's early pressure, it was Barcelona {{who scored}} the first {{goal of the}} match. Edwin van der Sar cleared the ball downfield for Manchester United, but it was headed away by Barcelona's midfield anchor Sergio Busquets. Carrick was first to the ball for Manchester United, but he could only head {{it as far as}} Xavi, who passed to Andrés Iniesta. The Manchester United defence <b>backed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Spaniard, who – after exchanging passes with Lionel Messi – played the ball into the path of Samuel Eto'o in the Manchester United penalty area. Nemanja Vidić {{attempted}} to shepherd the Cameroonian striker towards the goal line, but Eto'o easily stepped inside him and toe-poked the ball past Van der Sar to make it 1–0 to Barcelona inside 10minutes.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} {{by taking a}} single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over bowled by Pollard, Hassett fell for 13 on the second ball, which lifted suddenly after bouncing. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball {{in the same place}} as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded off the pitch and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman <b>backed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett. The crowd, sensing the importance of the two quick wickets, in particular that of Bradman, who had been so productive at Headingley, erupted. This left Australia struggling at 3/68, but a rapid counterattack by the middle and lower order took them to 9/457 at stumps and eventually 458 on the fourth morning.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, play resumed under {{hot and humid}} conditions. There had been rain on the pitch at 07:00, and Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} by taking a single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over of the day, Pollard got the second ball to lift. Caught out by the unexpected bounce, Hassett was unable {{to get out of}} the way and edged the ball to Crapp in the slips for 13. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball in the same place as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded low off the pitch, deviated back in and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33.

2500|$|Under {{pressure}} from the Church, the coalition government <b>backed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mother and Child Scheme and forced Browne's resignation as Minister for Health. He gave his version of events in his resignation speech to the Dáil on 12 April 1951. In particular, he deplored {{that the government had}} referred his Scheme to the Church for approval, taking care to describe it to the Church as his plan and not as government policy, giving him no option but to resign as minister. The Taoiseach, John A. Costello, immediately retorted that [...] "I have seldom listened to a statement in which there were so many—let me say it as charitably as possible—inaccuracies, misstatements and misrepresentations", and delivered his full reply several hours later. Following his departure from government, Browne embarrassed his opponents by arranging for The Irish Times to publish Costello's and MacBride's correspondence with the Catholic hierarchy, which detailed their capitulation to the bishops.|$|E

2500|$|The court then {{rejected}} other proposed {{tests of}} patent-eligibility {{that had been}} suggested since the Supreme Court's trilogy.

Thus, in the State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group case [...] the court had upheld a patent on a tax-avoidance scheme under this standard.

2500|$|The 1980s {{were a very}} {{turbulent}} time in Sweden that {{initiated the}} occasional decline of Social Democratic Party rule. In the 1980s, pillars of Swedish industry were massively restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernized paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialized, and mechanical engineering was digitalized. In 1986, one of the Social Democratic Party's strongest champions of egalitarianism and democracy, Olof Palme was assassinated. Swedish capital was increasingly moving Swedish investment into other European countries as the European Union coalesced, and a hegemonic consensus was forming among the elite financial community: progressive taxation and pro-egalitarian redistribution became economic heresy. A leading proponent of capital's cause at the time, Social Democrat Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt reminisced in an interview, [...] "The negative inheritance I received from my predecessor Gunnar Sträng (Minister of Finance, 1955–1976) was a strongly progressive tax system with high marginal taxes. This was supposed {{to bring about a}} just and equal society. But I eventually came to the opinion that it simply didn't work out that way. Progressive taxes created instead a society of wranglers, cheaters, peculiar manipulations, false ambitions and new injustices. It took me at least a decade to get a part of the party to see this." [...] With the capitalist confederation's defection from the 1938 Saltsjöbaden Agreement and Swedish capital investing in other European countries rather than Sweden, as well as the global rise of neoliberal political-economic hegemony, the Social Democratic Party <b>backed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> progressive Meidner reform.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 February 1970 Farrar was {{initiated}} into Alexandrian Wicca {{and joined the}} Sanders' coven. [...] Farrar met his future wife, then Janet Owen (34 years his junior), in the coven.

Two of Janet and Stewart's coven - [...] "Don and Barbara" [...] were present, as were the Sanders coven. Janet Farrar remembers the initiation well, as Maxine invoked Sekhmet to banish one of her coven members. She broke her flail during this banishing. Recently their 3rd Degree initiation has been disputed by some Alexandrian [...] "revisionists", unaware that Stewart Farrar kept an archive of all his correspondences with the Sanders and possessed copies of both his own and the Sanders' coven records that unequivocally prove that the initiation took place. [...] What Witches Do was published in 1971. The book has been called [...] "controversial" [...] because of Farrar's assertion that Sanders should be [...] "ranked above Gerald B.

As it was pretty windy on the interstate at the time, Jones weighted the banner down with a container to stop it blowing away. Jones continued to make obscene gestures and returned to his truck several times to pet his dog. This was all broadcast on live television by news helicopters recording the event live. As it was a Thursday afternoon, it was witnessed by many children, whose after-school cartoons had been interrupted in order to broadcast the incident. As authorities prepared to negotiate with him, Jones suddenly returned to his truck and sat in the front seat. Intending to take his own life, Jones ignited a Molotov cocktail inside his truck. The vehicle suddenly burst into flames and was set ablaze. Jones got out of the vehicle however and ran across the freeway as he was engulfed in flames and smoke, with his hair, pants and socks all on fire. Jones tried to pat out the flames, managing to peel off his pants, socks and underwear. He continued to wander about, naked from the waist, looking dazed and disoriented. He then walked {{to the edge of the}} freeway gesturing angrily. It appeared as if he was about to jump off the freeway, however, he changed his mind and <b>backed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> edge, before returning to his ablaze truck.

He placed the shotgun beneath his chin, pulled the trigger and committed suicide. He then fell to the ground with the cameras still rolling and playing the event live to viewers watching at home. Jones died at the age of forty, roughly two weeks after his birthday.|$|E
2500|$|After Campbell {{announced}} his resignation the BC Liberal Party leadership election began, {{the winner of}} which would become premier. In mid-December 2010 Lake endorsed George Abbott, citing Abbott's [...] "collaborative and engaging style to governing" [...] and his profile as a fellow Interior and rural MLA. Christy Clark would eventually win the leadership race. When the 39th Parliament resumed with a third session and Clark as premier, she promoted Lake to Minister of Environment and made him the deputy government house leader. Clark and Lake committed {{to continue with the}} carbon tax and a carbon neutral public service, but <b>backed</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> province's legislated greenhouse gas reduction targets. The issue about BC's participation in the Western Climate Initiative was reviewed by the entire cabinet, who decided to continue with WCI's planned cap-and-trade system. An emphasis in the Ministry of Environment was placed on BC Parks with announcements by Clark and Lake on the elimination of parking fees at parks, a one-year youth passport program, new online tools to facilitate park usage, a park bench sponsorship program, and a $500,000 program to celebrate B.C. Parks' 100th-anniversary. Lake came under criticism for not publicly releasing the report and recommendations of the Species at Risk Task Force. To compensate for the slow action on the task force, the opposition environment critic Rob Fleming re-introduced his own Species at Risk Protection Act in June 2011. Lake released the task force report in July for a public comment period. As the Minister of Environment, Lake had to defend the Environmental Assessment Office following a review by the Auditor General who identified short-comings and continued criticism regarding the rigorousness of the environmental review process as a proposed copper-gold mine, which was approved by Lake's predecessor, was refused by the federal government. Lake came under criticism from fellow BC Liberal MLAs John Les, John van Dongen, and Donna Barnett after Lake approved Metro Vancouver's waste-management plan which included proposals to incinerate garbage; Les and van Dongen felt the plan would significantly lower air quality in their Fraser Valley ridings and Barnett advocated for continuing the hauling of garbage to the Cache Creek landfill in her riding.|$|E
