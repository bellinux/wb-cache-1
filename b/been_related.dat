The police investigation into the matter was closed the same month.|$|E
5|$|An {{expedition}} to Ross by King William {{and his brother}} Earl David in 1179 may have <b>been</b> <b>related</b> to Harald's activities.

The rebellion was not finally suppressed until 1187.|$|E

For students with hybrid-learning experience, comfort <b>was</b> <b>related</b> to motivation and perceived quality, motivation <b>was</b> <b>related</b> to satisfaction, and satisfaction <b>was</b> <b>related</b> to perceived quality. For students with no online-learning experiences, comfort <b>was</b> <b>related</b> to motivation to learn technology skills, but neither of these factors <b>was</b> <b>related</b> to perceived quality of online courses...|$|R

5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} perceptions of organizational justice and workplace (in) civility in a promotional exam context. Specifically, it was proposed that perceptions of distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice {{and perceptions of}} workplace civility and incivility would <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to performance in a promotional assessment center, self-reported organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), and self-reported burnout. The model indicated that procedural justice <b>was</b> <b>related</b> to exam scores and OCBs. Interpersonal justice <b>was</b> <b>related</b> to OCBs towards the organization. Informational justice <b>was</b> <b>related</b> to OCBs. Workplace civility <b>was</b> <b>related</b> to OCBs and burnout.

5|$|Ahimsa {{is one of}} the {{cardinal}} virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. Ahimsa has also <b>been</b> <b>related</b> to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Most popularly, Mahatma Gandhi strongly believed in the principle of ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the coup}} were almost {{certainly}} the Byzantines, who had every interest in removing a dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody, if {{not from a}} pro-Byzantine faction, at least less actively aggressive. Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few hypotheses about Helmichis' motivation for his coup: his reason could have involved a family link to the Lethings, the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin's father Audoin; or he may have <b>been</b> <b>related</b> through Amalafrid to the Amali, the leading dynasty of the Goths. Helmichis easily obtained {{the support of the}} Lombards in Verona, and he probably hoped to sway all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin's only child, Albsuinda, under his control. He may also have hoped for Byzantine help in buying the dukes' loyalty economically.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Lund Cathedral in Scania {{started in}} about 1103 when {{the region was}} part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It was the first of great Danish Romanesque cathedrals {{in the shape of a}} three-aisled {{basilica}} with transepts. It seems to have <b>been</b> <b>related</b> to earlier German buildings, though there are also traces of Anglo-Norman and Lombard influences. Ribe, which followed with its great cathedral (1150–1250), had close trade contacts with the Rhine region of Germany. Both the materials, sandstone and tufa, and the models were taken from there.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} {{security}} after the 2016 election, {{there have been}} some detentions and arrests that have <b>been</b> <b>related</b> to the increased security at the tower. On December 6, a woman managed to bypass security and go to the 24th floor—two floors below Donald Trump's office—before being stopped by Secret Service officers. A week later on December 13, a Baruch College student who was arrested at Trump Tower was found to have multiple weapons, including knives, a garrote, and firecrackers. The next day, another man reportedly got angry after he wanted to meet Donald Trump at the tower, and after throwing a wine glass onto the floor of the tower's lobby, was subsequently detained by the NYPD.|$|E
5|$|Each block {{had access}} to courtyards, known as airing courts, and the asylum was {{surrounded}} by extensive grounds. At {{the end of each}} courtyard were stone rooms used to house incontinent patients, who slept on straw beds. All buildings were made from stone and iron, avoiding the use of wood because of the potential fire hazard. Hot and cold plunge baths were also included, as Fox saw their use as an important part of treatment, which may have <b>been</b> <b>related</b> to his Quaker beliefs and John Wesley's advocacy of the practice. The total construction cost around £35,000. In addition to the wealthy private patients, paupers funded by parish funds were also admitted and kept in accommodation furthest from the central block, which was for the highest in society.|$|E

No consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give Traidenis as the ancestor, this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson Boleslaw-Yuri would have violated canon law, since the two would have <b>been</b> <b>related</b> by blood, and this violation would likely have been noticed by the pope.|$|E

5|$|Hastings {{claimed that}} {{there was no mention of}} the case in police records held by {{archives}} in Adelaide, but that instead, the incident had <b>been</b> <b>related</b> to him by residents of the district who had known Brown. He also placed it as having occurred between 1860 and 1870. Foster et al. note that this date is highly unlikely, as frontier violence in the district began when squatters arrived in 1843, and was tapering off by 1848 when the murders occurred. By the 1860s, Aboriginal labour was highly sought after by pastoralists in the district due to the exodus of white labourers to the Victorian gold rush.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Coria and Currie {{found that}} various {{features}} of the rear part of the skull (such as the frontwards slope of the occiput and low and wide occipital condyle) indicate that Giganotosaurus {{would have had a}} good capability of moving the skull sideways in relation to the front neck vertebrae. These features may also have <b>been</b> <b>related</b> to the increased mass and length of the jaw muscles; the jaw articulation of Giganotosaurus and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the length of the jaw musculature, enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower jaw musculature, to increase the power of their bite.|$|E

Ten years later, a charter dated 19 August 825 indicates that Ecgberht was campaigning in Dumnonia again; this may have <b>been</b> <b>related</b> to a battle recorded in the Chronicle at Gafulford in 823, between the men of Devon and the Britons of Cornwall.|$|E

Chesney helped to further the career of Richard Barre, who became a writer and a royal judge and first appears in the record as a witness to some of Chesney's documents during 1160–1164.

5|$|In {{the first}} part of the 12th century, the manor passed from the second Baron of Dunham Massey to Matthew de Bromale.

He may have also held the manor at some point. The de Bromales held the manor until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married John de Davenport, and the family name was changed.|$|E
5|$|Inside the {{lacrimal}} {{bones were}} depressions {{that may have}} held glands, such as salt glands. Within the maxillae were sinuses that were better developed than those of more basal theropods such as Ceratosaurus and Marshosaurus; they may have <b>been</b> <b>related</b> {{to the sense of}} smell, perhaps holding something like Jacobson's organ. The roof of the braincase was thin, perhaps to improve thermoregulation for the brain. The skull and lower jaws had joints that permitted motion within these units. In the lower jaws, the bones of the front and back halves loosely articulated, permitting the jaws to bow outward and increasing the animal's gape. The braincase and frontals may also have had a joint.|$|E
