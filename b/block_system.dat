5|$|A {{variant of}} the Automatic <b>Block</b> <b>System,</b> Automatic and Track Control (ATC) has since been introduced, which {{provides}} the same benefits as ABS on single lines of track, while still ensuring only one train in a section at a time.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the MTA began {{automating}} the subway by Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC). CBTC supplements, rather than replaces, the fixed-block signal system; it allows trains to operate closer together. The BMT Canarsie Line, {{on which the}} L train runs, was chosen for pilot testing {{because it is a}} self-contained line that does not operate in conjunction with other lines. CBTC became operational in February 2009. Due to an unexpected ridership increase, the MTA ordered additional cars, and increased service from 15 trains to 26 trains per hour, an achievement beyond the capability of the <b>block</b> <b>system.</b> The total cost of the project was $340 million.|$|E
5|$|Albany {{has been}} a center of {{transportation}} for much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany saw development of the turnpike and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center of the state. Simeon De Witt developed a grid <b>block</b> <b>system</b> in 1794, and renamed streets for birds and mammals that had honored British royalty. This grid was intersected by the major arterials coming out of Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles. The construction of the turnpike across the state, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers going to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid-19th century.|$|E

5|$|Heavier {{suburban}} {{traffic on the}} Melbourne network saw a greater strain on the block working then used, which required {{a large number of}} manned signal boxes to enable trains to run close together. As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the Automatic <b>Block</b> <b>System</b> (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a safe distance between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant mechanical signals with two arms able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers. These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today, but the old mechanical style remained until 2001.|$|E
5|$|The safeworking of trains between {{stations}} on {{the early}} lines was time interval working, where a train {{would be allowed to}} leave a given time after the train before it. With heavier traffic this method became unsafe, with Staff and Ticket working on single lines adopted from 1873, and telegraph block working from 1878 on double lines. Both of these systems ensured that only one train would be in a section of track at one time. Telegraphic block working was then replaced with Winters Block working between 1883 and 1888, a system that is a predecessor of the Double line <b>Block</b> <b>system</b> which is still used today. Later years saw variations made to the Staff and Ticket system, with busier lines provided with Electric Staff working which provided greater safely when more trains ran.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper studies discrete-time linear {{systems with}} multirate outputs, {{assuming}} that two measured output streams {{are available at}} coprime rates. In the literature this type of system, which {{can be considered as}} periodic time-varying, is commonly studied in its blocked version, since the well-known techniques of analysis developed for linear time-invariant systems can be used. In particular, we focus on some structural properties of the <b>blocked</b> <b>systems</b> and we prove that, under a generic setting i. e. for a generic choice of parameter matrices, the <b>blocked</b> <b>systems</b> are minimal when the underlying multirate system is defined using a minimal dimension system. Moreover, we focus on zeros of tall <b>blocked</b> <b>systems</b> i. e. <b>blocked</b> <b>systems</b> with more outputs than inputs. In particular, we study those cases where the associated system matrix attains full-column rank. We exhibit situations where they generically have no finite nonzero zeros. I...|$|R

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{modernization}} of the New York City Subway, the MTA has plans to upgrade much of the system with communications-based train control (CBTC) technology, which will control the speed and starting and stopping of subway trains. The CBTC system is mostly automated and uses a moving <b>block</b> <b>system</b> – which reduces headways between trains, increases train frequencies and capacities, and relays the trains' positions to a control room – rather than a fixed <b>block</b> <b>system.</b> This will require new rolling stock to be built for the subway system, as only newer trains can use CBTC systems.|$|E
25|$|Most {{lines in}} Melbourne operate under an {{automatic}} <b>block</b> <b>system</b> of safeworking with three-position power signalling. This permits signals to operate automatically {{with the passage}} of trains, enforcing the distance between them. At junctions signals are manually controlled from signal boxes, with interlockings used to ensure conflicting paths are not set. The Flemington Racecourse line has two-position automatic signalling, a variant of the three-position system.|$|E

The strategy represents the program {{as a set of}} code fragments in-between two consecutive system calls (the <b>system</b> <b>blocks)</b> and a graph that represents the execution order of the fragment (the <b>system</b> <b>block</b> graph). The <b>system</b> <b>blocks</b> and the <b>system</b> <b>block</b> graph are partitioned between two virtual machines (VMs). The Blocks-VM stores and executes the <b>system</b> <b>blocks</b> but does not store any information on how control flows across the <b>system</b> <b>blocks.</b> This information is represented only by the <b>system</b> <b>block</b> graph stored in the Graph-VM, which correctly sequentializes the <b>system</b> <b>blocks</b> by analyzing the <b>system</b> <b>block</b> graph and accessing the Blocks-VM.

The overall strategy results in a clean separation between the program and its control-flow and this is important whenever the Graph-VM is in full control of the user whereas the Blocks-VM may be attacked through code injection. The Graph-VM can discover these attacks because either the current system call is not present in the original program or the hash of the current block is invalid. In all these cases, the Graph-VM halts the execution of the program.

25|$|The Jubilee {{line has}} been {{converted}} to automatic train operation, using the SelTrac S40 moving <b>block</b> <b>system.</b> The new system enables London Underground to run more frequent trains, increase capacity by a further 33%, and cut journey times by around 22%. Equipment installation and testing for the new systems began in late 2006, and the line upgrade work required the closure of sections of the Jubilee line each weekend during 2009. Although the project was due for completion in March 2010, the closures continued through 2010, and the upgrade was not finished until spring 2011. The new signalling system finally came into full operation on 26 June 2011. As a result, services began operating at the new higher frequency of 27 trains per hour from late July 2011, and were later improved to currently allow 30 trains per hour.|$|E
25|$|The <b>block</b> <b>system</b> handles all {{control and}} {{supervision}} of routes through interlockings including switch (point) control and switch status, for broken rail protection, and tracking of trains with failed (or not equipped for) CBTC. CBTC lines are fully track circuited with power frequency, single-rail track circuits. (Broken-rail protection is only guaranteed {{on one of}} the two rails, however.) Equipment aboard every train identifies the location of the train using wayside transponders as a basis. Once the Zone Controller has determined, based on track circuit information and train localization, that the CBTC train is a single discrete train ("sieved"). The Wayside Zone Controller uses this information to grant movement authorities based on conditions ahead. The CBTC Zone Controller functions then as an overlay which only provides safe separation of trains and cannot do so without interaction from the Wasyide (Legacy) Signaling system. Trains, with CBTC, can then operate closer together, although as before, platform dwell times and train performance are the true limiting factors in terms of headway performance. With the new system, signals and interlockings are still absolutely required, their job being done better by relay interlockings or Solid State Interlocking controllers. The ATS system at the Control Center is not a vital (life-safety) system and serves only to automate the routing of trains based on the overall timetable. The location of the train is also used to inform passengers of arrival times. The MTA's form of CBTC uses a reduced form of the old fixed-block signaling system, requiring that both be maintained at high cost.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with queueing systems of several service stations in series in which each station may consist of multi-servers. An infinite number of customers always waits {{in front of the}} first station, and each customer passes through all of the stations in sequence. There is only a finite number of waiting positions between any two adjacent stations. The service time for a customer at any station is assumed to be a random variable, the distribution of which may depend on the station. In this mode of operation the servers at any station will at any time be busy, idle, or <b>blocked.</b> This <b>blocking</b> <b>system</b> is said to be C-reversible if the capacity remains invariant under reversal of the system. The reversed system is obtained by reversing the original stations' order, that is, every customer in the reversed system passes through the original stations in the reverse order. It has already been proved that C-reversibility holds for any <b>blocking</b> <b>system</b> in which each station consists of either a single server of nondeterministic service times or multi-servers of deterministic service times, and that the <b>blocking</b> <b>system</b> has a stronger property than C-reversibility. In this paper we show that two-station <b>blocking</b> <b>systems</b> with multi-server stations of nondeterministic service times are C-reversible, but this property can no longer be extended to three or more station <b>blocking</b> <b>systems</b> with multi-server stations of nondeterministic service times. We also show for the case of multi-server stations of nondeterministic service times that the stronger property which involves invariance of distribution does not hold even for two-station <b>blocking</b> <b>systems.</b> tandem queue, <b>blocking,</b> reversibility...|$|R

This cause the effective utilization {{to be higher than}} the natural (productive) utilization. As in (semi-) process industries the capital intensity is high, the correct load for a given capacity is crucial. For given demand volumes (and mix), the objective is to operate the equipment {{in such a way that}} productivity is maximized without (too much) blocking. This problem happens to be very complex, especially in a stochastic setting. Methodologically, we can conclude that analytical models to model these systems are not wide spread. However, there exists a great similarity between <b>blocking</b> <b>systems</b> without buffer and kanban systems. For kanban systems, analytical models to calculate the performance are available.
