50|$|The {{main reason}} for the decline of Buddhism during this period was mainly due to the {{infiltration}} of Catholicism, which spread <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the kings, who gave a free hand to the missionaries to spread their faith. This decline further increased with {{the division of the}} Buddhist monks into two groups as 'Silvats' and 'Ganinnanses'. The Portuguese and Dutch influence in the Kandyan Kingdom over the Sinhalese were such that the Sinhalese began to assimilate foreign customs, ways of life, dress and language resulting in transformation of their local life style. It was inevitable that these foreign customs seeped into the Buddhist monks as well.|$|E
50|$|Many {{children}} as young as twelve years old are feeling pressured to try cannabis in the Netherlands. The reason for this is <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tolerance</b> principle that is in place, meaning that authorities cannot prosecute someone for possessing cannabis if it is under five grams. Because of the lack of enforcement in this, it is giving children the opportunity to possess marijuana in small amounts. Dutch youth have reported higher than average availability of cannabis, but no higher compared to the United States. Many coffee shops have been shut down because of how close they are to schools. Local authorities were afraid that the location of the businesses would influence the youth and take advantage of them.|$|E

The mechanism that determines {{which of the two}} species dominates the succession remains unknown. We conducted a series of experiments to investigate the inter-specific relationship between S. costatum and P. donghaiense. The results of the P. donghaiense and S. costatum bialgal culture experiments indicated that S. costatum dominates P. donghaiense under high-nutrient conditions, and the interaction was independent of the initial chlorophyll a ratios. Adding S. costatum culture filtrates did not significantly influence the growth of P. donghaiense and S. costatum under high-nutrient conditions. Under low-nutrient conditions, the S. costatum filtrates showed a significant autoinhibitory effect, but they did not inhibit the growth of P. donghaiense <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tolerance</b> of P. donghaiense to allelochem-icals.

Embryos and tadpoles of six anurans, Bufo americanus, Rana sylvatica, Rana pipiens, Rana clamitans, Rana catesbeiana, and Hyla versicolor, and embryos and larvae of two salamanders, Ambystoma maculatum (the yellow-spotted salamander) and Ambystoma laterale (the blue-spotted salamander), were exposed to different UV-B radiation regimes in containers (12 cm in diameter and 4. 5 cm deep) with Nitex screening (1 mm) on the sides to permit natural exchange with pond water. The containers were secured to a floating structure in a small natural pond in south-central Ontario, where most of the species tested lived and successfully recruited offspring. Three exposure conditions were evaluated: (i) natural incident light, (ii) incident light with the UV-B radiation filtered out, and (iii) incident light with the UV-B radiation enhanced by UV-B lamps. Embryos of all species hatched successfully under enhanced and incident UV-B radiation conditions. However, salamander larvae and anuran tadpoles were sensitive to enhanced UV-B radiation conditions and a differential sensitivity was observed based on developmental stage. When 2 weeks old, anuran tadpoles showed greater sensitivity than when newly hatched. Incident levels of UV-B radiation had no significant effect on tadpoles or larvae. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the embryos and the very rapid attenuation of UV-B radiation in the water of small ponds (high in dissolved organic carbon (DOC)), little direct damage is likely to occur during the aquatic stages of these amphibians...|$|E

30|$|In a {{practical}} situation, {{it is impossible}} to completely acquire <b>the</b> state information <b>of</b> all neurons in neural networks <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their complicated structure. So it is worth to investigate <b>the</b> state estimation <b>of</b> neural networks. Recently, some results on <b>the</b> state estimation <b>of</b> neural networks have been obtained [25 – 27]. In addition, in analog VLSI implementations of neural networks, uncertainties, which can be modeled as an energy-bounded input noise, should be taken into account <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tolerances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> utilized electronic elements. Therefore, it is of practical significance to study the H_∞ state estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> delayed neural networks. Some significant results on this issue have been reported by some researchers [28 – 34]. For instance, in [28], the state estimation problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guaranteed H_∞ performance of static neural networks was discussed. In [31], based on the reciprocally convex combination technique and a double-integral inequality, a delay-dependent condition was derived such that the error system was globally exponentially stable and a prescribed H_∞ performance was guaranteed. In [32], further improved results were proposed by using zero equalities and a reciprocally convex approach [35].|$|R
40|$|In <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> {{robotics}} {{and automatic}} assembly tooling, {{it is often}} necessary to provide some compliance when fitting two parts together or when engaging a tool with a complementarily shaped aperture.

A remote centre compliance (RCC) is a device that can provide a compliance center projected outward from the device. Remote compliance centers decouple lateral and angular motion.

Thus, despite the shifts in geographic range and climatically suitable areas towards southeastern Brazil, our analyses do not predict a strong loss of genetic diversity in D. alata <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broad <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> this species, which ensures large future ranges, contrasting with other Cerrado species that have been analyzed in a similar manner...|$|R
40|$|The Siemens {{electromagnetic}} Lithostar tube "C" {{and the new}} multiline tube "M" lithotripters {{were compared}} for the in situ treatment of ureteral calculi. A series of 248 patients with a calcium oxalate ureteral stone (proven by stone analysis) more than 4 mm in diameter were treated between December 1994 and September 1995 with the tube M Multiline lithotripter. The results were {{compared with those of}} 462 patients treated in prior years with tube C. High energy levels were obtained without sedation in 11 % of patients with tube C and in 61 % with tube M. <b>The</b> proportion <b>of</b> patients needing additional analgetics was 11 % and 6 %, respectively. <b>The</b> percentages <b>of</b> patients reporting no pain at all were 7 and 77. In proximal calculi, stone-free status was achieved in 63 of 79 patients (80 %) with tube C and in 82 of 91 patients (90 %) with tube M (p = 0. 057). In distal calculi, stone-free status was achieved in 124 of 173 patients (72 %) with tube C and in 134 of 157 patients (85 %) with tube M (p = 0. 0027). The evacuation rate for distal ureteral stones was significantly higher with tube M, which implies that the new shock head can enable the operator to apply higher energy without sedation <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> better <b>tolerance.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
