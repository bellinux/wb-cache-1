40|$|A certain {{proportion}} of DRI produced in India is consumed for the steel production through the induction furnace route which provides for slag metal separation actuated by a mere melting of the DRI without any purification reactions. Government of India, {{owing to the}} poor quality of steel produced from DRI through the induction furnace route has stipulated that, steel to be marketed must contain less than 0. 085 % of combined sulphur and phosphorous. Therefore the DRI producing companies are initiating a method of dephosphorizing the steel produced from the induction furnace route. The present work is an attempt at dephosphorizing the steel produced in the induction furnace route from DRI which is high in phosphorous (upto 0. 096 % are common).

In these cathodes, the reaction between a barium source material and tungsten powder contained in a cavity surrounding a porous tungsten emitter produces barium vapor which is crucial to operation of the cathode. The primary objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the reactions between tungsten and a commercial barium source material in a simulated reservoir hollow cath-ode environment. Mixtures of tungsten and a <b>barium</b> calcium <b>aluminate</b> material were sealed inside molybdenum capsules with porous tungsten closures and heated to 1000 ? 1200 ?and 1300 ?or 100, 200, and 400 hours. Based on the reaction products, which were identified to be BaAl 2 O 4 and Ba 2 CaWO 6, a reaction was proposed for the <b>barium</b> calcium <b>aluminate</b> material with tungsten. The bottom pellets in the capsules were found to have reacted to a much further extent than the top pellets in all of the samples, possibly due to a temperature gradient or excessive moisture in the base of the capsules. Quantita-tive and semi-quantitative x-ray analysis results did not show a clear trend as to how the concentrations of BaAl 2 O 4 and Ba 2 CaWO 6 vary with time. Most of the barium source materials are hygroscopic, and hydration of the materi-als would substantially reduce the performance of the cathode. Therefore, the environ-mental stability of several barium compounds, 3 BaO?? 2 O 3 (B 3 A), 6 BaO???? 2 O 3 (612), 4 BaO????O 3 (411), Ba 2. 9 Ca 1. 1 Al 2 O 7 (B 4 ASSL), and Ba 3 Sc 4 O 9, were investi-gated in order to evaluate their suitability for use as barium source materials. A micro-balance was used to measure weight gain of the materials as they were exposed to dew points of ??C and 11 ?t room temperature.

Hollow cathodes with <b>barium</b> calcium <b>aluminate</b> impregnated tungsten emitters for thermionic emission are widely used in electric propulsion. These cathodes are employed in ion thrusters, Hall thrusters and are being considered for MPD thrusters too. After a brief introduction on the current emission processes from a metallic surface, we study the chemistry and the physics of cathodes activation and operation.

Severe interdiffusion has been observed for the epitaxial c axis oriented YBaCu oxide films grown on an MgO substrate, which leads to a deterioration in the superconductivity. The main reason for reduced Tc and quality of cuprate films on MgO is the copper loss into the substrate, the depth of penetration of copper extending more than 400 nm below the YBaCuO [...] -MgO interface.

This study aims to investigate the sub-economic aluminium resources through investigation and identify the right technologies through laboratory tests for metal extraction and utilization of the by-products of K-feldspar sandy shale. The investigation of the sub-economic aluminium resources includes field and site visits and data collection and collation. A series of laboratory scale tests were carried out for different types of bauxite and potassic sandy shale, which includes initial try tests and formal laboratory experiments for optimization of the processes and procedures, and crop planting tests for use of potassium and silicon fertilizers. The successful laboratory tests (technologies) in this study were optimized and proved to be effective. The results showed: 1) Medium temperature metallization roasting and then magnetic separation, and gas reduction metallization roasting and then magnetic separation are effective for processing of the high iron diasporic bauxite; 2) Dry magnetic separation, wet magnetic separation and medium temperature magnetization roasting and then magnetic separation are not effective for processing of the high iron diasporic bauxite; 3) Digestion at atmospheric conditions and high caustic alkali concentration is effective for processing of low A/S and high iron gibbsite bauxite; 4) Desulfurization flotation and desulfurization with <b>barium</b> <b>aluminate</b> are both effective for processing of the high sulfur bauxite.

40|$|The University of Missouri-Rolla {{identified}} {{materials that}} permit the safe, reliable and economical operation of combined cycle gasifiers by the {{pulp and paper}} industry. The primary emphasis of this project was to resolve the material problems encountered during the operation of low-pressure high-temperature (LPHT) and low-pressure low-temperature (LPLT) gasifiers while simultaneously understanding the materials barriers to the successful demonstration of high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) black liquor gasifiers. This study attempted to define the chemical, thermal and physical conditions in current and proposed gasifier designs and then modify existing materials and develop new materials to successfully meet the formidable material challenges. Resolving the material challenges of black liquor gasification combined cycle technology will provide energy, environmental, and economic benefits that include higher thermal efficiencies, up to three times greater electrical output per unit of fuel, and lower emissions. In the near term, adoption of this technology will allow the {{pulp and paper industry}} greater capital effectiveness and flexibility, as gasifiers are added to increase mill capacity. In the long term, combined-cycle gasification will lessen the industry's environmental impact while increasing its potential for energy production, allowing the production of all the mill's heat and power needs along with surplus electricity being returned to the grid. An added benefit will be the potential elimination of the possibility of smelt-water explosions, which constitute an important safety concern wherever conventional Tomlinson recovery boilers are operated. Developing cost-effective materials with improved performance in gasifier environments may be the best answer to the material challenges presented by black liquor gasification. Refractory materials were selected or developed that reacted with the gasifier environment to form protective surfaces in-situ; and were functionally-graded to give the best combination of thermal, mechanical and physical properties and chemical stability; and are relatively inexpensive, reliable repair materials. Material development was divided into 2 tasks: Task 1 was development and property determinations of improved and existing refractory systems for black liquor containment.

Task 2 was finite element analysis of heat flow and thermal stress/strain in the refractory lining and steel shell of existing and proposed vessel designs. Stress and strain due to thermal and chemical expansion has been observed to be detrimental to the lifespan of existing black liquor gasifiers.

The structural properties were studied by collecting the XRD patterns of the samples using an X'Pert PRO PANalytical diffractometer with CuKα at λ = 0. 15405 nm. The particle morphologies of the as-synthesized powder phosphors were investigated using a JEOL JSM- 7500 F field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The optical properties of the phosphors were studied using Perkin-Elmer Lambda 750 s UV-Vis spectrometer, Jobin Yvon/SPEX FluoroLog spectrofluorometer (Model FL- 1040) and Riso TL/OSL reader (Model DA- 20). The as-prepared SrAl 2 O 4 :Eu 2 +; SrAl 2 O 4 :Dy 3 +; SrAl 2 O 4 :Mn 2 +; phosphors were synthesized at an initiating temperature of 600 oC. The XRD patterns {{were consistent with the}} low temperature monoclinic structure of SrAl 2 O 4 for all the as-synthesized phosphor powders. SEM measurements showed nano-rod like particles. The SrAl 2 O 4 :Eu 2 +; SrAl 2 O 4 :Dy 3 +; SrAl 2 O 4 :Mn 2 + samples were excited using a 450 W Xenon light source at 364 nm, 390 nm, and 426 nm respectively. A broad blue emission peak at 500 nm shown by the SrAl 2 O 4 :Eu 2 + sample is attributed to the 6 1 7 4 f 5 d  4 f transition of the Eu 2 + ion. Also, the red sharp emission lines due to the 4 f- 4 f transition of the Eu 3 + were observed. SrAl 2 O 4 :Dy 3 + samples exhibited blue, green, and red emissions which can be atributed to the 4 6 9 / 2 15 / 2 F  H, 4 6 9 / 2 13 / 2 F  H, and 4 6 9 11 2 2 F  H transitions of Dy 3 + ions respectively. The two broad emissions (green at 513 nm and red at 650 nm) shown by 2 + 0. 98 2 4 0. 02 Sr Al O :Mn sample can be atributed to the 4 4 6 6 1 1 T (G)  A (S) transition of the Mn 2 + ion in the sample.

The blue emissions were observed in all the samples except SrAl 2 O 4 :Eu 2 +,Mn 2 +, Dy 3 + sample. The SrAl 2 O 4 :Eu 2 +,Mn 2 +, Dy 3 + phosphor showed the longest afterglow intensity. The BaAl 2 O 4 doped with Eu 2 +, Mn 2 + and Dy 3 + phosphors synthesized at an initiating temperature of 600 oC using combustion method. The XRD patterns confirmed the hexagonal structure of BaAl 2 O 4 in all the as-synthesized samples. A broad blue emission of the BaAl 2 O 4 :Eu 2 + sample at 490 nm is attributed to the 6 1 7 4 f 5 d  4 f transition of the Eu 2 + ion in the sample. A red emission peak observed at 611 nm is due to the 4 f - 4 f transition of un-reduced Eu 3 + ions during the combustion reaction. A blue emission at 482 nm, a green emission at 575 nm, and a red emission at 663 nm of the BaAl 2 O 4 :Dy 3 + sample can be associated with 4 6 9 / 2 15 / 2 F  H, 4 6 9 / 2 13 / 2 F  H, and 4 6 9 11 2 2 F  H transitions of the Dy 3 + ions respectively. The green emission peaks exhibited by BaAl 2 O 4 :Mn 2 + sample at 512 nm is due to the 4 4 6 6 1 1 T (G)  A (S) transitions of the Mn 2 + ions. <b>Barium</b> <b>aluminate</b> phosphors doped with different concentrations of Dy 3 + ion were synthesized by combustion method at an initiating temperature of 600 oC. The XRD patterns confirmed the hexagonal structure of BaAl 2 O 4. The emission peaks observed at 482 nm, 575 nm, and 663 nm are due to 4 6 9 / 2 15 / 2 F  H, 4 6 9 / 2 13 / 2 F  H and 4 6 9 11 2 2 F  H transitions of Dy 3 + ion respectively. The PL measurements also confirmed the quenching of luminescence at higher concentrations of the Dy 3 + ion. The UV-Vis measurements has confirmed the increase in the band-gap of the BaAl 2 O 4 sample followed by a decrease and an increase again as doping concentration of the Dy 3 + increased. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the Ca 0. 97 M 0. 3 Al 2 O 4 :Eu 2 +, Dy 3 + (M = Ba, Mg, and Sr) powder samples prepared by combustion method confirms the monoclinic structure of CaAl 2 O 4 in all samples.

The phosphors were characterized by exposure to UV light, powder XRD, fluroescence and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The phosphors showed a characteristic emission band in the region 435 - 462 nm when they were excited at 254 nm.

40|$|The huge {{emissions}} of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel fired power plants and industrial plants over the last century have resulted in an increase of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Climatological modeling work has predicted severe climate disruption {{as a result of the}} trapping of heat due to CO{sub 2 }. As an attempt to address this global warming effect, DOE has initiated the Vision 21 concept for future power plants. We first synthesized mesoporous aluminosilicates that have high surface area and parallel pore channels for membrane support materials. Later we synthesized microporous aluminosilicates as the potential thin membrane materials for selective CO{sub 2 } adsorption. The pore size is controlled to be less that 1 nm so that the adsorption of CO{sub 2 } on the pore wall will block the passage of N{sub 2 }. Mesoporous and precipitated alumina were synthesized as the base material for CO{sub 2 } adsorbent. The porous alumina is doped with Ba to enhance its CO{sub 2 } affinity due to the basicity of Ba. It is shown by gas chromatograph (GC) that the addition of Ba enhances the separation CO{sub 2 } from N{sub 2 }. It was found that mesoporous alumina has larger specific surface area and better selectivity of CO{sub 2 } than precipitated alumina. Ba improves the affinity of mesoporous alumina with CO{sub 2 }. Phase may play an important role in selective adsorption of CO{sub 2 }. It is speculated that mesoporous alumina is more reactive than precipitated alumina creating the xBaO {center_dot}Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } phase that may be more affinitive to CO{sub 2 } than N{sub 2 }. On the other hand, the <b>barium</b> <b>aluminates</b> phase (Ba{sub 3 }Al{sub 2 }O{sub 6 }) in the mesoporous sample does not help the adsorption of CO{sub 2 }. Microporous aluminosilicate was chosen as a suitable candidate for CO{sub 2 }/N{sub 2 } separation because the pore size is less than 10 {angstrom}. If a CO{sub 2 } adsorbent is added to the microporous silica, the adsorption of CO{sub 2 } can block the passage of N{sub 2 } and an effective CO{sub 2 }/N{sub 2 } separator will be found. It was first demonstrated that microporous silica could be synthesized. The microporous silica was then impregnated with Ba(OH) {sub 2 }. No adsorption of CO{sub 2 } was observed. It was found that alumina must be added to facilitate CO{sub 2 } adsorption. However, no microporous aluminosilicates have been shown before. We developed a process that partially coat alumina on microporous silica. It was demonstrated that microporous aluminosilicates can be obtained by the coating process and a candidate material for selective CO{sub 2 } separation is available...|$|R
