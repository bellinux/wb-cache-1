5|$|Maya warriors entered {{battle against}} the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. Members of the Maya {{aristocracy}} wore quilted cotton armour, and some warriors of lesser rank wore twisted rolls of cotton wrapped around their bodies. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.|$|E
5|$|The main {{striking}} {{force of the}} Parthian army was its cataphracts, heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in mailed armor. The cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines, but were not equipped with <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> arrows which were restricted to horse archers. Due {{to the cost of}} their equipment and armor, cataphracts were recruited from among the aristocratic class who, in return for their services, demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the Arsacid kings. The light cavalry was recruited from among the commoner class and acted as horse archers; they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle. They used composite <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> were able to shoot at enemies while riding and facing away from them; this technique, known as the Parthian shot, was a highly effective tactic.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until the}} middle part of the 20th century, it was {{customary}} to wear Tudor style under-dress, consisting of white silk embroidered doublet, breeches, full hose, white doeskin pumps with satin <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> a sword belt with sword, under the robes. Nowadays, morning dress or a lounge suit is worn, except for coronations when Tudor under-dress is worn by the canopy-bearers.|$|E

50|$|For {{long-range}} weapons, the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow {{was tested}} against the sling. The <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow's effective range was 50 yards while the sling delivered two kills and three wounds with five shots. The edge {{was given to}} the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow for its superior range, accuracy, rate of fire, and lethality.|$|R

5|$|For millennia, archery {{has played}} a pivotal role in Chinese history. Because the {{cultures}} associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse. Historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest that a variety of bow designs existed throughout Chinese history. For much of the 20th century, only one Chinese traditional bow and arrow making workshop was active. However, {{in the beginning of the}} 21st century, there has been revival in interest among craftsmen looking to construct <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> arrows in the traditional Chinese style.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} {{in what is now}} Pennsylvania since at least 10,000 BC. The first {{settlers}} were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools. The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artefacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000BC and 1500AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> arrow, and ornaments.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Bhutan, fire <b>and</b> the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow were an {{important}} means of survival in the highlands during war and on hunts. The <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow {{play a significant role}} in many Bhutanese myths and legends; images of the gods holding a <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrows are considered especially favorable. Symbolic and religious significance of the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow is associated with the legendary murder of Tibetan King Langdarma in the 10th century. The king had persecuted Buddhism, and thus failed to perform his duty as he made mischief. A Buddhist monk, Lhalung Pelgi Dorji, performed the Black Hat Dance to entertain the king, during which he feigned a bow before the king, drew a <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow hidden in the big sleeves of a ceremonial dance costume, and killed the king.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow {{constituted}} the classical Indian weapon of warfare, from the Vedic period, until {{the advent of}} Islam. Some Rigvedic hymns lay emphasis {{on the use of}} the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> arrow.|$|R

5|$|Sandgate was {{completed}} by the autumn of 1540; Henry may {{have come to the}} castle when he was visiting Folkestone in May 1542. Elizabeth I visited the fortification in 1573, and also used it to imprison the courtier Thomas Keyes for a period, after he married Lady Mary Grey against the Queen's wishes. In 1593, the castle was reported to be equipped with seven artillery pieces - one culverin, two demi-culverins, three sakers and one minion - along with muskets, <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> arrows.|$|E
5|$|The Tzotzil Maya of {{highland}} Chiapas used spears, thrown rocks, <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> arrows, {{and large}} flexible cotton shields that protected the warrior {{from head to}} foot and could be rolled up for storage. Towns were sometimes defended with walls and barricades, built from packed earth and stone, and reinforced with tree trunks. Defenders would hurl stones down from above, or pour boiling water mixed with lime and ashes upon attackers. As the Spanish became established in Chiapas, indigenous resistance took the form of flight to inaccessible regions.|$|E
5|$|Uses {{for regular}} glass fiber include mats and fabrics for thermal insulation, {{electrical}} insulation, sound insulation, high-strength fabrics or heat- and corrosion-resistant fabrics. It {{is also used}} to reinforce various materials, such as tent poles, pole vault poles, arrows, <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> crossbows, translucent roofing panels, automobile bodies, hockey sticks, surfboards, boat hulls, and paper honeycomb. It has been used for medical purposes in casts. Glass fiber is extensively used for making FRP tanks and vessels.|$|E
50|$|In June 1942, Shōkaku had her {{anti-aircraft}} armament augmented {{with six}} triple 25 mm mounts, two each at the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> stern, and one each {{fore and aft}} of the island. The <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> stern groups each received a Type 95 director. In October another triple 25 mm mount was added at the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> stern and 10 single mounts were added before the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944.|$|R

5|$|At around 19:30, von Spee ordered Dresden and Leipzig {{to launch}} a torpedo attack against the damaged British armored cruisers. Dresden {{increased}} speed to position herself off the British <b>bows,</b> <b>and</b> briefly spotted Glasgow as she was withdrawing, but the British cruiser disappeared in the haze and gathering darkness. Dresden then encountered Leipzig; both ships initially thought the other was hostile. Dresdens crew was loading a torpedo when the two ships confirmed each other's identity. By 22:00, Dresden {{and the other two}} light cruisers were deployed in a line that searched unsuccessfully for the British cruisers. Dresden had emerged from the battle completely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Composite bows {{were soon}} adopted and adapted by civilizations {{who came into}} contact with nomads, such as the Chinese, Assyrian, and Egyptian. Several {{composite}} bows were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun, who died in 1324 BCE. Composite <b>bows</b> (<b>and</b> chariots) are known in China from at least the Shang Dynasty (1700–1100 BCE). We have strong indications to believe that Bronze Age Greek Cultures like the Minoans and the Mycenaeans were using composite bows in a large scale. By the 4th century BCE, chariotry had ceased to have military importance, replaced by cavalry everywhere (except in Britannia where charioteers are not recorded as using bows).|$|E
5|$|Constructing {{composite}} bows requires {{much more}} time and {{a greater variety of}} materials than self <b>bows,</b> <b>and</b> the animal glue used can lose strength in humid conditions; the 6th-century Byzantine military manual, the Strategikon, advised the cavalry of the Byzantine army, many of whom were armed with composite bows, to keep their bows in leather cases to keep them dry. Karpowicz suggests that crafting a composite bow may take a week's work, excluding drying time (months) and gathering materials, while a self bow can be made in a day and dried in a week. Peoples living in humid or rainy regions historically have favoured self-bows, while those living in dry or arid regions have favoured composite bows.|$|E

60|$|Slowly I rose, {{and murmured}} my thanks, <b>and</b> <b>bowed,</b> <b>and</b> {{tried to be}} off; but as quickly I turned, <b>and</b> <b>bowed,</b> <b>and</b> thanked, and lingered again and again. Oh, charmers! oh, Peris! thought I, must I go? Yes, Wellingborough, you must; so I made one desperate congee, and darted through the door.|$|R
5|$|European {{visitors}} in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they very effectively defended with <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> arrows. They {{were the only}} ethnic group encountered by the European party that had built a bridge. Homes were made of plant material; the Sihanaka believed building homes in brick or clay would invite the displeasure of the ancestors. Gendered roles factored into house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build {{the frame of the}} house and roof, as well as the windows and doors and their frames, while women wove zozoro reed mats that would serve as walls, flooring and roofing.|$|E
5|$|From the Glades peoples, {{two major}} nations {{emerged in the}} area: the Calusa and the Tequesta. The Calusa was {{the largest and most}} {{powerful}} nation in South Florida. It controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee, and on the Florida Keys. Most Calusa villages were located at the mouths of rivers or on key islands. The Calusa were hunter-gatherers who lived on small game, fish, turtles, alligators, shellfish, and various plants. Most of their tools were made of bone or teeth, although sharpened reeds were also effective for hunting or war. Calusa weapons consisted of <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> arrows, atlatls, and spears. Canoes were used for transportation, and South Florida tribes often canoed through the Everglades, but rarely lived in them. Canoe trips to Cuba were also common.|$|E
5|$|In combat, {{players can}} use {{long-range}} weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, and <b>bows,</b> <b>and</b> short-range weapons such as handguns and short-barreled shotgun. Players can scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies. Players can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment {{such as health}} kits and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the health meter and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged {{through the use of}} health kits..|$|E
50|$|The {{next phase}} {{is to build}} up the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> stern. Tapering cones of reeds are wedged {{together}} until a high <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> double stern are formed. The double stern adds more stability and carrying capacity to the ship while at sea.|$|R

5|$|It {{was while}} {{operating}} off the Iberian Peninsula that Collier devised {{a need for}} an improved type of ships' boat. He developed a design based on elements of both a whaleboat and a jolly boat, and had one built for him at Plymouth Dockyard. The boat proved extremely useful after tests aboard the Surveillante, especially at being able to land safely on a flat beach to give close support. Collier further modified it by installing a howitzer in the <b>bows,</b> <b>and</b> soon boats of its type were being requested by other captains for their ships. In 1813 Collier succeeded Sir Home Popham in commanding the north coast squadron, Spain. He and a small squadron supported General Arthur Wellesley and General Sir Thomas Graham in the capture of San Sebastián and the siege of Bayonne.|$|E
5|$|Larger ships {{often had}} false <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> sterns painted in a {{different}} shade {{from the rest of}} the hull to create the impression of the ship being at greater range from the observer. German decks were a very dark gray. Smaller ships operating in the North Sea or Baltic Sea were painted white or a very pale gray to blend in with daytime mist and nighttime phosphorescent organisms. As in the First World War, the Germans again employed disguised commerce raiders, Hilfskreuzer such as Atlantis, Thor and Kormoran. These ships were able to modify their appearance to throw off the searching Allied cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Maya armies {{were highly}} disciplined, and warriors participated in regular {{training}} exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male {{was available for}} military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; {{the needs of their}} crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder. Maya warriors entered battle against the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.|$|E
