5|$|After being {{considered}} for the Detroit Tigers' managerial vacancy that offseason, Peckinpaugh took over as manager of the Kansas City Blues of the Class-AA American Association for the 1934 season. Out of professional baseball in 1935, Peckinpaugh joined Lew Fonseca on nationwide baseball tours, which involved the viewing of a movie and technical demonstrations. He applied to be manager of the Boston Bees for the 1938 season, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> was given to Casey Stengel. Peckinpaugh returned to professional baseball as {{the manager of the}} New Orleans Pelicans of the Class-A1 Southern Association in 1939.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 to 1975, Baxter was {{part-time}} and unpaid {{chairman of}} the Sydney Opera House Trust. He had recently retired from the UNSW, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> was no sinecure. The architect, Jørn Utzon, had left, construction was behind schedule and over budget, and specialist staff needed to be recruited. Baxter put the project under his unpopular but decisive grip, and brought the Sydney Opera House to completion and opening on 20 October 1973.|$|E
5|$|Robson's {{success with}} Ipswich had {{attracted}} the attention of many bigger clubs, and he had been linked with the Manchester United job when Dave Sexton was sacked in May 1981, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> went to Ron Atkinson instead. It was the Football Association who lured Robson away from Portman Road a year later, when he accepted their offer to manage the England national team in July 1982.|$|E

5|$|Christie was {{promoted}} to rear admiral {{as part of his}} move back to Newport. In January 1943, however, Rear Admiral Robert English, Commander, Submarines, U.S. Pacific Fleet, was killed in a plane crash. Christie hoped to get the position <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> went to Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, commander of submarine operations in Fremantle, and the Bureau of Personnel selected Christie to take over Lockwood's old command. Christie lobbied Vice Admiral Arthur 'Chips' Carpender, Douglas MacArthur's Commander Allied Naval Forces, to allow him to replace Fife as commander of the larger submarine force at Brisbane. Carpender refused, and Christie went on to Fremantle. Nevertheless, Christie continued to try for some time to take the Brisbane force under his control.|$|E
5|$|A major {{influence}} on Ueshiba's early education was his elementary schoolteacher Tasaburo Nasu, {{who was a}} Shinto priest and who introduced Ueshiba to the religion. At {{the age of six}} Ueshiba was sent to study at the Jizōderu Temple, but had little interest in the rote learning of Confucian education. However, his schoolmaster Mitsujo Fujimoto was also a priest of Shingon Buddhism, and taught the young Ueshiba some of the esoteric chants and ritual observances of the sect, which Ueshiba found intriguing. His interest in Buddhism was sufficiently great that his mother considered enrolling him in the priesthood, but his father Yoroku vetoed the idea. Ueshiba went to Tanage Higher Elementary School and then to Tanabe Prefectural Middle School, but left formal education in his early teens, enrolling instead at a private abacus academy, the Yoshida Institute, to study accountancy. On graduating from the academy, he worked at a local tax office for a few months, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> did not suit him and in 1901 he left for Tokyo, funded by his father. Ueshiba Trading, the stationery business which he opened there, was short-lived; unhappy with life in the capital, he returned to Tanabe {{less than a year later}} after suffering a bout of beri-beri. Shortly thereafter he married his childhood acquaintance Hatsu Itokawa.|$|E
5|$|Ho Yuen Hoe {{was born}} on 18 February 1908, to a family of silk weavers in Guangzhou, China, the second of three children. Her family was poor, and she was sold when she was five years old. Barely two years later, the {{spinster}} who had purchased her died, and Ho was sold by the woman's nephew, to become a maid. After a few years she was sold again. In her late teens, a group of snakeheads persuaded her and several other girls to emigrate to Singapore, ostensibly {{to work on a}} rubber plantation, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> did not materialise. At the age of 21, alone and penniless, she married the owner of a grocery business. When the business failed, they left for Hong Kong, hoping for better fortune. Ho became a hairdresser in nearby Macau, but after discovering that her husband had another wife and children she decided to return to Singapore alone, vowing never to remarry. At about that same time, she became a vegetarian.|$|E

25|$|After his {{departure}} from West Brom, Robson spent eight {{months out of}} the game. He was interested in becoming the England under-21 team's full-time manager, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> went instead to Stuart Pearce on a part-time basis.|$|E
25|$|Kendall's third spell {{as manager}} ended in June 1998 {{when he was}} sacked, and it seemed likely that {{chairman}} Peter Johnson would turn to Manchester United assistant manager Brian Kidd as his successor, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> went to Walter Smith instead.|$|E

Twenty years later the shipyard was privatized <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> were still there.|$|R
25|$|Agere Systems still {{maintained}} its {{position as a}} key chip supplier for cell phones and hard disk drives.

25|$|In 1938, {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Harry Kipke as Michigan's head football coach, there were press reports that Blott was being considered (and was Yost’s pick) for the head coaching job at Michigan, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> went to Fritz Crisler from Princeton.|$|E

25|$|In February 2013, it was {{reported}} that Neville was being considered for the England U20 managerial position for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

On 4 July 2013, Neville became first-team coach of Manchester United, where he would be reunited with manager David Moyes. It was announced on the same day Moyes named Ryan Giggs as player/coach.|$|E
25|$|Section two, Clause four, {{provides}} that when vacancies {{occur in the}} House of Representatives, {{it is not the}} job of the House of Representatives to arrange for a replacement, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of the State whose vacant seat is up for refilling. Moreover, the State Governor may not appoint a temporary replacement, but must instead arrange for a special election to fill the vacancy.

40|$|Jobs {{that started}} in 1976 lasted on average {{for two to three}} years, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> of people who were {{employed}} in 1976 had average durations of over fifteen years. This paper demonstrates how different concepts of <b>the</b> duration of <b>jobs</b> result in widely different estimates and shows that, although job durations differ considerably between industries and occupations, fairly long job tenures for those currently employed are typical. These results are consistent with the widespread existence of internal labour markets and have some implications for macroeconomic policy...|$|R
25|$|In Tallinn, Konstantin Päts {{started his}} career as an {{assistant}} at the advocacy of Jaan Poska, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> wasn't satisfactory for Päts. In Tartu, Jaan Tõnisson had already founded his nationalist newspaper Postimees in 1891, Päts was planning to found his own in Tallinn. The first inspiration came from writers Eduard Vilde and Anton Hansen Tammsaare, who {{could not get a}} licence from the Ministry of Internal Affairs because of their social democratic views. Instead they used Päts as an unknown lawyer with an affiliation in the Orthodox Church.|$|E
25|$|Murray {{was sent}} off sick {{for a month}} (24 January 1915) and French demanded his {{resignation}} (25 January 1915), despite Murray insisting that he only needed {{to take a few}} days off. Wilson was widely suspected of having plotted for Murray's removal in the vain hope of replacing him, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> went to Robertson. Although a sore throat prevented him seeing Murray off, French wrote to him (29 January) saying he hoped to see him back as an army commander before long.

25|$|It was not {{the first}} time that Ferguson had been linked with a move to England. In February 1982, Wolverhampton Wanderers had {{approached}} him about succeeding John Barnwell as manager as they were heading for relegation from the First Division. He rejected this offer, perhaps concerned about the club's financial stability, as they were more than £2million in debt at the time and narrowly avoided going out of business. At the end of the 1984–85 season, it was reported that Ferguson was being considered for the Liverpool manager's job after the retirement of Joe Fagan was announced, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> was quickly accepted by Liverpool striker Kenny Dalglish.|$|E
