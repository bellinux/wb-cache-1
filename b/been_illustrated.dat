5|$|Murasaki wrote The Diary of Lady Murasaki, {{a volume}} of poetry, and The Tale of Genji. Within a decade of its completion, Genji was {{distributed}} throughout the provinces; within a century it was recognized as a classic of Japanese literature and had become a subject of scholarly criticism. Early in the 20th century her work was translated; a six-volume English translation was completed in 1933. Scholars continue to {{recognize the importance of}} her work, which reflects Heian court society at its peak. Since the 13th century her works have <b>been</b> <b>illustrated</b> by Japanese artists and well-known ukiyo-e woodblock masters.|$|E
5|$|The Metamorphoses of Ovid has <b>been</b> <b>illustrated</b> {{by several}} artists through time. In 1563 in Frankfurt, a German bilingual {{translation}} by Johann Posthius was published, featuring the woodcuts of renowned German engraver Virgil Solis. The illustration of Myrrha depicts Myrrha's deceiving her father {{as well as}} her fleeing from him. In 1717 in London, a Latin-English edition of Metamorphoses was published, translated by Samuel Garth and with plates of French engraver Bernard Picart. The illustration of Myrrha was entitled The Birth of Adonis and featured Myrrha as a tree delivering Adonis while surrounded by women. In 1857 French engraver Gustave Doré made a series of illustrations to Dante's Divine Comedy, the depiction of Myrrha showing her in the eighth circle of Hell.|$|E

5|$|In post-classical times, Myrrha has had {{widespread}} {{influence in}} Western culture. She was {{mentioned in the}} Divine Comedy by Dante, was an inspiration for Mirra by Vittorio Alfieri, and was alluded to in Mathilda by Mary Shelley. In the play Sardanapalus by Byron, a character named Myrrha appeared, whom critics interpreted {{as a symbol of}} Byron's dream of romantic love. The myth of Myrrha was one of 24 tales retold in Tales from Ovid by English poet Ted Hughes. In art, Myrrha's seduction of her father has <b>been</b> <b>illustrated</b> by German engraver Virgil Solis, her tree-metamorphosis by French engraver Bernard Picart and Italian painter Marcantonio Franceschini, while French engraver Gustave Doré chose to depict Myrrha in Hell as a part of his series of engravings for Dante's Divine Comedy. In music, she has appeared in pieces by Sousa and Ravel. She was also the inspiration for several species' scientific names and an asteroid.|$|E

25|$|Robot {{designer}} Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil {{have predicted}} that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, which has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger, has <b>been</b> <b>illustrated</b> in fiction as well, for example in the manga Ghost in the Shell and the science-fiction series Dune.|$|E

25|$|The {{airport was}} {{designed}} to be larger than any in the world, bigger in size than the New York, London, Berlin, Paris, Chicago, and Philadelphia ones put together. Woodhouse claimed it would eventually become the combined size of the airports of Croydon in London, Le Bourget in Paris, Tempelhof in Berlin, Roosevelt Field in New York, Chicago's Air Park, and Boston's Jeffery Field. However, the airport never did develop as intended and a 1949 picture taken from an airplane showed no evidence of the three world's longest runways which had <b>been</b> <b>illustrated</b> in earlier depictions.|$|E

25|$|In a 1919 {{review in}} The American Economic Review, Stanley E. Howard stated, that the {{materials}} {{of the volume}} are well organized. The reader is given a bird's eye view of the problems dealt with, and is then shown in detail the development of cost and controlling records from the various business and factory forms. The authors have taken pains to emphasize relationships, presenting frequent summary charts. Fundamentals regarding the forms for orders, reports, and records have <b>been</b> <b>illustrated,</b> and the mistake {{has not been made}} of confounding multiplicity of illustration with clarity of exposition.|$|E
25|$|Implicit {{memory is}} the non-declarative, or unspoken, aspects of memory. Priming, motor memory and {{classical}} conditioning are all examples of implicit memory. An example of implicit memory's {{effect on our}} social interactions has <b>been</b> <b>illustrated</b> by the pin-in-hand phenomenon. This phenomenon was first observed by Claparède while dealing with an amnesiac patient. Normally, he would shake the patient's hand and introduce himself, as the patient thought it was their first time meeting. However, on one occasion he hid a pin and pricked the patient with it when she reached to shake his hand. Later, when he offered his hand, she drew away and refused to shake, {{in spite of the}} fact she could not explicitly recall the pinprick itself. The patient was unable to provide a reason for her hesitation.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 study {{examined}} adolescents who illustrated resilience to bullying and found some interesting gendered differences, with higher behavioral resilience found among girls and higher emotional resilience found among boys. Despite these differences, they still implicated internal resources and negative emotionality in either encouraging or being {{negatively associated with}} resilience to bullying respectively and urged for the targeting of psychosocial skills {{as a form of}} intervention. Emotional intelligence has <b>been</b> <b>illustrated</b> to promote resilience to stress and as mentioned previously, the ability to manage stress and other negative emotions can be preventative of a victim going on to perpetuate aggression. One factor that is important in resilience is the regulation of one’s own emotions. Schneider et al. (2013) found that emotional perception was significant in facilitating lower negative emotionality during stress and Emotional Understanding facilitated resilience and has a positive correlation with positive affect.|$|E

25|$|The marble herm {{figure with}} the bearded head of philosopher type, bearing the {{explicit}} inscription, {{must be taken}} as purely conventional. Unidentified portrait heads did not find a ready market in post-Renaissance Rome. This bust was formerly {{in the collection of}} marchese Pietro Massimi at Palazzo Massimi and belonged to marchese L. Massimi at the time the engraving was made. It is now in the Villa Albani, Rome (inv. 1034). The inscribed bust has often <b>been</b> <b>illustrated</b> in engravings and photographs: a photograph of it forms the frontispiece to the Loeb Classical Library Theophrastus: Enquiry into Plants vol. I, 1916. André Thevet illustrated in his iconographic compendium, Les vraies Pourtrats et vies des Hommes Illustres (Paris, 1584), an alleged portrait plagiarized from the bust, supporting his fraud with the invented tale that he had obtained it from the library of a Greek in Cyprus and that he had seen a confirming bust in the ruins of Antioch.|$|E
25|$|Bees {{provide a}} good example of the {{mutualism}} that exists between hymenopterans and angiosperms. Flowers provide bees with nectar (an energy source) and pollen (a source of protein). When bees go from flower to flower collecting pollen they are also depositing pollen grains onto the flowers, thus pollinating them. While pollen and nectar, in most cases, are the most notable reward attained from flowers, bees also visit flowers for other resources such as oil, fragrance, resin and even waxes. It has been estimated that bees originated with the origin or diversification of angiosperms. In addition, cases of coevolution between bee species and flowering plants have <b>been</b> <b>illustrated</b> by specialized adaptations. For example, long legs are selected for in Rediviva neliana, a bee that collects oil from Diascia capsularis, which have long spur lengths that are selected for in order to deposit pollen on the oil-collecting bee, which in turn selects for even longer legs in R. neliana and again longer spur length in D. capsularis is selected for, thus, continually driving each other's evolution.|$|E
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} {{is reported}} to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought. For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying. Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the organizational structure and in pursuing goals. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees. Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels. Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress. The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional stress, seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of coping with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high social intelligence and low emotional intelligence (EI). In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at influencing others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to manipulative behaviour, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be. In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be persuaded to engage in unethical behaviour. With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that rationalizes the behaviour, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying. Hutchinson & Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and leadership skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behaviour among other members of the work team have been shown to {{have a significant impact on}} ethical behaviour of nursing teams. Higher EI is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace. The self-awareness and self-management dimensions of EI have both <b>been</b> <b>illustrated</b> to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy work environments and work culture.|$|E
