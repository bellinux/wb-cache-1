40|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out {{on behalf of the}} Poole Harbour Heritage Project in Kimmeridge Bay between 2009 and 2010, as part of a project researching the Dorset Alum and Copperas industries. There is documentary evidence for alum production at Kimmeridge in 1569 by John Clavell and 1605 - 1617 by William Clavell, but the precise location of their works is not known. Earthwork survey revealed the remains of three linked ponds with associated dams and sluices, industrial deposits, and a number of stone and timber structures along the shoreline. The ponds were most likely constructed as part of the early-seventeenth-century alum works. Examination of eroding industrial deposits along the shoreline (at SY 9088 7880) revealed buried beach deposits overlain by an extensive layer of <b>burnt</b> <b>shale</b> and shale ash that may have derived from the earliest alum works. This was sealed by clay and stone structures that may have formed part of a former quay or jetty perhaps also related to William Clavell's industrial ventures. This was buried beneath tips of <b>burnt</b> <b>shale</b> waste, probably relating to nineteenth-century activity. Exploratory excavations and geophysical survey were undertaken around the toilet block (centred on SY 9103 7878) where brick-built furnaces had been previously discovered, but this revealed that the archaeological remains were not extensive. Part of two flues and associated firing pits were found, probably related to the previously discovered furnaces, but they appeared unused. No dating evidence was recovered and no definite link to alum production was found...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{results for}} the {{pyrolysis}} of Rundle oil shale in a 5 kg h- 1 fluidized bed pilot plant are reported. Experiments have been conducted over a range of temperatures, 480 - 540 °C, particle residence time in the range 18 - 35 min and with two particle size fractions, 0. 15 - 0. 53 mm and 0. 53 - 0. 99 mm. Increasing the retorting temperature resulted in a large increase in the hydrocarbon gas yield due to thermal cracking reactions. Oil yields less than Fischer assay were observed, probably due to coking of oil on the <b>burnt</b> <b>shale.</b> Over the ranges covered, particle size and solids residence time did not affect oil yield, relative to Fischer Assay oil yield. G. c. -m. s. {{has been used to}} study the effect of process parameters on oil composition. The volatility and aromaticity of the fluid bed oil were higher than for Fischer assay oil, and oil volatility and aromaticity increased with retorting temperature {{as a result of an}} increase in thermal cracking reactions with temperature...|$|E

Differences in the frost resistance of concretes made with various second main constituents show how significant {{is the type of}} hydration of the second main constituent in terms of the durability. Alternate immersion-drying tests were carried out to analyze the frost resistance of concretes compared to the other main constituents.

40|$|<b>Burnt</b> alun <b>shale</b> {{and lime}} is the {{residual}} product that was formed when alun shale {{was used as}} fuel to convert limestone to quick lime. The material contains arsenic, vanadium, molybdenum, cadmium, nickel, lead, and uranium among other elements. The aim {{of this paper is}} to examine the uptake of trace elements in vegetables grown on <b>burnt</b> alun <b>shale</b> and lime to determine whether or not the surrounding environment and humans are exposed to these elements by eating plant products. A cultivation trial was carried out where onion, carrot, and lettuce were grown on three mounds of <b>burnt</b> alun <b>shale</b> and lime in the Falköping area in Sweden. The treatments were <b>burnt</b> alun <b>shale</b> and lime mixed with peat, only <b>burnt</b> alun <b>shale</b> and lime, and a reference soil. The reference plots were natural soil mixed with peat adjacent to the mounds. After harvest the vegetables were dried and weighed in order to determine the growth. Growth medium samples were analyzed for the plant available fraction of arsenic, vanadium, molybdenum, cadmium, nickel, and lead. Plant samples were analyzed for the total content of the above-mentioned trace elements. Particle size distribution, organic matter content and pH was also determined for the growth medium samples. The growth of the vegetables was, as expected, higher with the treatment with <b>burnt</b> alun <b>shale</b> and lime mixed with peat compared to the treatment with only <b>burnt</b> alun <b>shale</b> and lime. The treatment with only <b>burnt</b> alun <b>shale</b> and lime gives higher concentrations of trace elements in the vegetables, than the treatment with <b>burnt</b> alun <b>shale</b> and lime mixed with peat. There is a positive correlation between the concentration of NH 4 NO 3 - extractable arsenic, vanadium, molybdenum, and cadmium in the growth medium and the concentration in the vegetables. The correlation between the concentration of NH 4 NO 3 - extractable nickel and lead in the growth medium and the concentration in the vegetables is on the other hand slightly negative. Lettuce is the vegetable that generally contained the highest concentrations of trace elements compared to onion and carrot. No conclusions could be drawn on whether the pH had any effect on the contents of trace elements in the growth medium or the uptake in the vegetables. Nor has the particle size distribution or the organic matter content had any visible effect on the content of trace elements in the growth medium or in the vegetables. The quantity of molybdenum in carrot on one square meter cultivation area at the trial site Rörsberga exceeds the limit value for human daily intake. This is the only exceeded value for carrot and for onion no value on quantity exceeded the limit values. For lettuce on one square meter cultivation area at Rörsberga, the limit value is exceeded for the quantity of arsenic, vanadium, molybdenum, and cadmium. At the trial site Tomten the quantity of vanadium exceeds the limit value and on the reference plot at Uddagården the quantity of vanadium and cadmium exceeds the recommended limit value. These quantities do not imply any acute health risk for humans since quite large amounts of vegetables are needed in order to reach the limit values...|$|R
40|$|Oil and gas were {{recovered}} from alum shale (black shale) at Kvarntorp, Närke,during {{a period of}} 24 years. One of the remnants of this industry is a 100 m highdeposit with high contents of uranium, arsenic, molybdenum, vanadium and otherelements. Presently the leakage of metals from the deposit into nearby streams israther modest but will most likely accelerate in the near future. One way to preventan uncontrolled leakage of these elements from the deposit into the environmentwould be to install a filter with an effective adsorbent that after saturation could easilybe regenerated and reused. The filter could not only be used to reduce the impact ofmetal leakage to the environment but also to reclaim valuable elements like nickel,vanadium, uranium and molybdenum. Unfortunately such a filter does not existtoday, {{but there are a}} wide range of minerals that have high adsorbing capacities andcould serve as filter components in a mineral barrier system. The adsorbingproperties of some natural minerals with respect to selected metals that are abundantin the Kvarntorp deposit are studied in this project. These minerals are bentoniteclay, (burnt clay), unburnt shale (stybb), <b>burnt</b> <b>shale</b> (rödfyr), apatite, peat andbark. In the experiments each sorbent was blended with artificial groundwater and acertain amount of metal stock solution. Samples were taken at five different pH. The results show that the two shale-products stand out from the othersand have the best adsorbing qualities for nickel, copper and zinc. At a pH over 7 between 96 and 99 % of the metal ions were removed from the solution. Unburned shale especially shows remarkably good results for vanadiumthroughout the tested pH range of 3, 4 - 7, 7 between 98 and 99 % of the vanadium ionswere removed from the solution. Unburned shale performs best of the testedadsorbents and could probably be used as an adsorbent in a geological barrier butmore research is needed...|$|E
40|$|Natural pozzolans {{are defined}} as either raw (volcanic material, limestone) or {{calcined}} natural materials (<b>burnt</b> <b>shale,</b> calcined kaolinite) with pozzolanic properties. Historically, {{they are among the}} oldest materials that have been used in combination with lime for construction purposes. For example, Santorin earth is a natural pozzolan from a volcanic eruption around 1500 BCE on an island of the same name in Greece. Over the last decades, research into cement matrices has been changing direction, owing to deeper environmental concerns over the impact of the cement industry and its consequences for climate change. Global environmental policies are increasingly strict, prioritizing the re-use rather than the disposal of industrial wastes. In this context, {{one of the biggest challenges}} is the search for strategies that promote the industrial rotation of high volumes of wastes in their productive cycles. The main purpose of this research is to widen the existing knowledge base on the behavior of new mineral pozzolans of high added value in the cement sector, lending special attention to paper sludge wastes generated in the process of paper manufacture, in which recycled paper is used as a raw material. The results to date show that, once thermally activated (in the range of 650 – 700 °C), paper sludge turns out to be an alternative source of recycled metakaolin. This product is characterized by its high pozzolanic activity and improved performance with regard to the benefits of certain binary cements. The possibility of incorporating this industrial waste in cements along with other already standard pozzolans focuses, as mentioned, on the notable increase in the production of these types of cements. This is due, at present, to the extensive constructive applications for type-II cements (single additive) and to their lower economic and energetic costs that also makes them more suitable in times of economic crisis. In the present paper, the influence that pozzolan blends (activated paper sludge and fly ash) have on the reaction kinetics of ternary blended cements (6 and 21...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{great need}} in many cities for {{a better quality of}} urban soil maps. This is due to the {{increasing}} interest in repurposing vacant land for urban redevelopment, agriculture, and green infrastructure. Mapping vacant urban land in Detroit can be very difficult because anthropogenic soils were often highly variable and frequently contained demolition debris (such as brick), this makes it difficult to use a hand auger. This study was undertaken in Detroit, MI to create a more efficient way to map urban soils based on their geophysical and chemical properties. This will make the mapping process faster, less labor intensive, and therefore more cost effective. Optical and chemical criteria for the identification and classification of microartifacts (MAs) were made from a set of reference artifacts of a known origin. These MAs were then observed and tested in urban topsoil samples from sites in Detroit, Michigan that represent three different land use types (residential demolition, fly ash-impacted, and industrial). Optical analyses, SEM, EDAX, and XRD showed that reference MAs may be classified into five basic compositional types (carbonaceous, calcareous, siliceous, ferruginous and miscellaneous). Reference MAs were generally distinguishable using optical microscopy by color, luster, fracture and microtexture. MAs that were more difficult to classify were further differentiable when using SEM, EDAX, and XRD. MAs were found in all of the anthropogenic soils studied, but were highly variable. All three study sites had concentrations coal-related wastes were the most common types of MAs observed and often included coal, ash (microspheres, microagglomerate), cinders, and <b>burnt</b> <b>shale.</b> MAs derived from waste building materials such as brick, mortar, and glass, were typically found on residential demolition sites. Manufacturing waste MAs, which included iron-making slag and coked coal were commonly observed on industrial sites. Fly ash-impacted sites were composed of only microspheres and microagglomerate that were concentrated within the soils by airborne deposition, making it widespread. These results support the hypothesis that MA assemblages of distinct composition vary with land use. Therefore, it seems likely that magnetic susceptibility surveying and other geophysical methods will prove effective for mapping anthropogenic soils on vacant urban land. Anthropogenic soils and MAs were assessed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and magnetic susceptibility (MS). The A horizons of urban soils at residential demolition, industrial-impacted, and fly ash-impacted sites were found to be distinguishable from those of native soils. Anthropogenic soils were higher by one pH unit or more than the background level, had an EC value two to three times the background level, and had MS measurements up to 20 times greater than the background level. The analysis of reference artifacts suggested that the elevated pH of anthropogenic soils was caused by calcareous building material wastes, the elevated EC were the result of both calcareous and ferruginous wastes, and elevated MS were attributable to ferromagnetic materials. Anthropogenic soils collected at residential demolition sites were differentiable by EC, whereas those at collected form industrial sites were distinguishable using MS. Therefore, anthropogenic soils and native soils have a unique chemical and geophysical signature which can be highly dependent on the concentration of MAs. This suggests that EC and MS surveying methods may be used to remotely sense and map urban soils more effectively than using traditional methods alone...|$|E

The general objective {{of this research was}} to investigate phosphate and ammonium removal from waste water by constructed wetland systems (CWS), which are increasingly being used for low-cost water treatment. Phosphate (P) adsorption capacity and other properties of potential CWS substrate materials (bauxite, <b>shale,</b> <b>burnt</b> oil <b>shale,</b> limestone, zeolite, light expanded clay aggregates (LECA) and fly ash) were investigated. Fly ash and shale had the highest P adsorption values, which were significantly correlated with porosity and hydraulic conductivity.
