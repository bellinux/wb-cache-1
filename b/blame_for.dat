The Government was <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> {{restrictive}} conditions of the licence; the management was <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> bad programme scheduling and failing to control escalating costs; shareholders were <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> having the short-term mentality of property developers. However, the Government blamed the collapse on the unwillingness of the shareholders to inject more capital, after it had spent its entire HK$20 million within one year. Many TV series were brought by TVB and ATV and TVB seldom rebroadcast them.|$|R

5|$|Khai's {{appeal was}} rebutted with {{an appeal to}} history, {{nationalist}} sentiment and a demand that the <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> death and destruction lay with the colonial forces and their Vietnamese assistants.

40|$|Extract] Over {{the past}} 30 years, {{we have seen}} 'moral panics' over {{literacy}} education fuelled by the media in the British, Australian, Canadian, and American press (Barron, 2000). 'Moral panics' as a rhetorical strategy promote deficit thinking and construct literacy crises that require expedient political solutions. Too often children are <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> poor attention, disruptive behavior or disinterest; parents are <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> disorderly family routines and turmoil in the home; teachers are <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> failing to teach traditional values and get their students to perform; and teacher educators are <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> failing to impart the necessary knowledge to reach children who lack mainstream social values and literacy practices. As long-time researchers of literacy, {{we know it is}} no easy matter to disrupt discourses of blame that attend literacy failure and underachievement...|$|R

5|$|According to Ovid, Myrrha was the {{daughter}} of King Cinyras and Queen Cenchreis of Cyprus. It is stated that Cupid was not to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> Myrrha's incestuous love for her father, Cinyras. Ovid further comments that hating one's father is a crime, but Myrrha's love was a greater crime. Ovid therefore blamed it on the Furies.|$|E
5|$|After {{the formal}} {{surrender}} on September 2 aboard Missouri, investigations into Japanese war crimes began quickly. At {{a meeting with}} General MacArthur later in September, Emperor Hirohito offered to take <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the war crimes, but his offer was rejected, and he was never tried. Legal procedures for the International Military Tribunal for the Far East were issued on January 19, 1946.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the battle, a state of {{confusion}} spread through the French troops. Governor de Vaudreuil, who later wrote to his government and put the full <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the French rout on the deceased Montcalm, decided to abandon Quebec and the Beauport shore, ordering all of his forces to march west and eventually join up with Bougainville, leaving the garrison in Quebec under the command of Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay.|$|E
5|$|Incorrect {{unloading}} sequences and ballasting {{which resulted}} in the buoyancy of the hull becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations.

5|$|Just as the furore {{appeared}} to have died down, in April 1952 Sydney's Daily Mirror published {{a letter from a}} reader, Jacob Raith. Responding to a letter in support of Barnes, Raith sided with the Board and suggested that his character was to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the omission. Acting on legal advice, Barnes sued Raith for libel and engaged Sydney's leading barrister, Jack Shand KC, as counsel.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Albuera {{had little}} effect on the overall course of the war, but it had shown that British and Spanish troops could work together. On the other hand, Anglo-Spanish {{political}} relations suffered following the battle.

No arrests were ever made. The Czechoslovak Civil Aviation Authority later attributed the explosion to a briefcase bomb.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} inquiry held {{jointly by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full public inquiry were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> any deficiencies, {{so as not to}} prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blame</b> <b>for</b> {{the loss}} of Blücher was not placed on Hipper, but on his {{superior}} Admiral von Ingenohl, who was removed from his post on 4 February.
