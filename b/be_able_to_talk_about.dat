500|$|In 2012, New York artist Sophia Wallace {{started work}} on a {{multimedia}} project to challenge misconceptions about the clitoris. Based on O'Connell's 1998 research, Wallace's work emphasizes the sheer scope {{and size of the}} human clitoris. She says that ignorance of this still seems to be pervasive in modern society. [...] "It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary," [...] she said. [...] "Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible." [...] The project is called Cliteracy and it includes a [...] "clit rodeo", which is an interactive, climb-on model of a giant golden clitoris, including its inner parts, produced with the help of sculptor Kenneth Thomas. [...] "It's been a showstopper wherever it's been shown. People are hungry to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> this," [...] Wallace said. [...] "I love seeing men standing up for the clit [...] Not having access to the pleasure that is your birthright is a deeply political act." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pamuk {{stated that}} he was {{consequently}} subjected to a hate campaign that forced him to flee the country. He returned later in 2005, however, to face the charges against him. In an interview with BBC News, {{he said that he}} wanted to defend freedom of speech, which was Turkey's only hope for coming to terms with its history: [...] "What happened to the Ottoman Armenians in 1915 was a major thing that was hidden from the Turkish nation; it was a taboo. But we have to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the past." [...] However, when Turkish television, CNN TURK asked Pamuk about his speech, he admitted that he said that [...] "Armenians were killed" [...] but he rejected that he said [...] "Turks killed Armenians" [...] and he estimated the number of deaths (as 1 million) in that speech.|$|E
2500|$|One {{suggested}} that a goal of interview preparation should be to present oneself as [...] "comfortable with spontaneous conversation" [...] and <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> interests without sounding like the answers were prepared in advance, and suggested {{it was important to}} show intellectual passion and a love of learning with a deep excitement, and show [...] "social maturity" [...] with sensitivity, empathy for others unlike oneself, and concern for issues larger than personal career ambitions. An applicant should have an attitude that was not be what can the college offer but what can the student offer the college, and he or she should avoid asking questions about facts better answered elsewhere, and show an openness to new ideas, an ability to work cooperatively with others, ambition, and caring about others. Interviewees should be ready for sometimes provocative questions to test social sensitivity; if an interviewer asks a [...] "baiting or leading question", an applicant should respond by laughing while politely disagreeing with the perspective, and to keep trying to enjoy the conversation with the interviewer. Another advisor {{suggested that}} students must be prepared to answer the question What is your biggest failure in an interview. Applicants should avoid sounding snide, annoyed, contemptuous, and avoid describing oneself as humiliated, bored, depressed, angry, shy, inhibited, anxious, frightened, and frustrated, and should be upbeat but avoid going for the hard sell. Another report suggested that shy or timid applicants were at a disadvantage. Another advisor {{suggested that a}} student try to find a common bond with the interviewer, and send a brief follow-up letter afterwards.|$|E

60|$|As I {{grew older}} my {{thoughts}} took a larger flight, and I frequently fell into long reveries about distant voyages and travels, and thought how fine it would be, to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> remote and barbarous countries; with what reverence and wonder people would regard me, if I {{had just returned}} from the coast of Africa or New Zealand; how dark and romantic my sunburnt cheeks would look; how I would bring home with me foreign clothes of a rich fabric and princely make, and wear them up and down the streets, and how grocers' boys would turn back their heads to look at me, as I went by. For I very well remembered staring at a man myself, who was pointed out to me by my aunt one Sunday in Church, as the person who had been in Stony Arabia, and passed through strange adventures there, all of which with my own eyes I had read in the book which he wrote, an arid-looking book in a pale yellow cover.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{my desire}} that this, which I shall post here to-morrow, shall be a tiny {{item in the}} hecatomb of {{friendship}} gracing your breakfast table on Christmas morning and mingling the smoke of (certain) aged and infirm victims with the finer and fresher fumes of the board. But the aged and infirm propose and the postman disposes and I can only hope I shall not be either disconcertingly previous or ineffectively subsequent. If my mind's eye loses you at sweet (yet sublime) Underbank, I still {{see you in a}} Devonshire mild light and feel your Torquay window letting in your Torquay air--which, at this distance, in this sadly Southeasternized corner, suggests all sorts of enviable balm and beatitude. It was a real pang to me, some weeks ago, when you were coming up to town, to have to put behind me, with so ungracious and uncompromising a gesture, the question, and the great temptation, of being there for a little at the same moment. But there are hours and seasons--and I know the face of them well--when my need to mind my business here, and to mind nothing else, becomes absolute--London tending rather over-much, moreover, to set frequent and freshly-baited traps, at all times, for a still too susceptible and guileless old country mouse. All my consciousness centres, necessarily, just now, on a single small problem, that of managing to do an [...] "American book" [...] (or rather a couple of them,) that I had supposed myself, in advance, capable of doing on the spot, but that I had there, in fact, utterly to forswear--time, energy, opportunity to write, every possibility quite failing me--with the consequence of my material, my [...] "documents" [...] over here, quite failing me too and there being nothing left for me but to run a race with an illusion, the illusion of still seeing it, which is, as it recedes, so to speak, a thousand lengths ahead of me. I shall keep it up as a tour de force, and produce my copy somehow (I have indeed practically done one vol. of [...] "Impressions"--there are to be two, separate and differently-titled;) but I am unable, meanwhile, to dally by the way--the sweet wayside of Pall Mall--or to turn either to the right or the left. (My subject--unless I grip it tight--melts away--Rye, Sussex, is so little like it; and then where am I? And yet the thing interests me to do, though at the same time appalling me by its difficulty. But I didn't mean to tell you this long story about it.) I hope you are plashing yourself in more pellucid waters--and I find I assume that there is in every way a great increase of the pellucid in your case by the fact of the neighbouring presence of your (as I again, and I trust not fallaciously assume) sympathetic collaterals. I should greatly like, here, a collateral or two myself--to find the advantage, across the sea, of the handful of those of mine who are sympathetic, makes me miss them, or the possibility of them, in this country of my adoption, which is more than kind, but less than kin.... I spend the month of January, further, in this place--then I do seek the metropolis for 12 or 14 weeks.
