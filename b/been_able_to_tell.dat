5|$|Jared {{initially}} {{tells the}} police nothing {{of what he}} saw. He is torn between the need {{to tell the truth}} and the desire to protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy's murder; however, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko. Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still has not <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.|$|E

500|$|Aru {{said after}} the stage that he had <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> that Dumoulin was tired. He paid {{particular}} credit to his teammates who had encouraged him to attack from a long way out. Dumoulin {{said that he had}} been [...] "just empty" [...] before he was dropped on the Morcuera. Plaza's stage victory was described as [...] "extraordinary" [...] and [...] "epic" [...] by Cycling Weekly; he {{said after the}} climb that he knew the climbs well and had intended to ride {{all the way to the}} finish when he made his initial attack. The stage victory was his second in the Vuelta (following a time-trial win in 2005) and also his second Grand Tour stage of the season, after he also won a stage of the 2015 Tour de France.|$|E
40|$|Scientific, {{and more}} {{specifically}} empirical observations, are incapable of deriving a cohesive moral theory based solely on those distinctions. What we find in the ethical world is far more complex than any one series of observations and scientific theories which could establish or break down existing moral theory. Definitions and ethical codes regarding behavior require a more robust and creative approach. The thesis of this paper is, then, no scientific descriptions are descriptions that <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us how things ought to be. A valid standard form categorical syllogism can be formulated to demonstrate how this conclusion is arrived at by logical necessity. CELARENT EAE- 1 No descriptions of what exists are descriptions that <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us how things ought to be. All scientific descriptions are descriptions of what exists. Therefore, no scientific descriptions are descriptions that <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us how things ought to be. The major categorical term of this argument is descriptions that <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us ho...|$|R

500|$|In {{addition}} to the ride's motion base and 3D projections, special effects including fog machines, fire, wind, heat, mist, strobe lights, and water spray are also employed throughout the attraction. All of these effects, along with the ride system, 3D projections and soundtrack, are controlled by a central industrial control system which knows, to one thirtieth of a second, when they are to execute. Just shy of the ride's debut, the director of show and ride engineering at Islands of Adventure, Steve Blum, described The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man as the [...] "most technically complex {{of all of the}} attractions" [...] at the park. Vice president of design and creative development Mark Woodbury stated that they [...] "would not have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> this particular story if it weren't for the technical tools".|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, McGregor {{announced}} his departure from Neighbours and a Herald Sun reporter {{stated that he}} would film his final scenes in April. On screen, his character was seen exposing corruption within the local police force and then receiving threats from some of his colleagues. McGregor later explained to a Press Association reporter that Mark's exit storyline {{would not be a}} happy one, as he is forced out of Ramsay Street. Mark is asked to enter a witness protection program and the night before he leaves, he realises he is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, Kate (Brewer). McGregor told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap [...] "He hasn't <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Kate that he's leaving before now – but he just can't say goodbye, and asks her to come along with him. It's such a very big ask, so of course she has to give it a lot of thought." ...|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall liked Frank's final conversation concerning Fauxlivia's pregnancy, {{praising the}} plot twist's potential to [...] "make for some interesting drama, perhaps even allowing {{the show to}} get past the inevitable mawkishness of most pregnancy stories." [...] However, there was some negative fan feedback concerning the pregnancy storyline. In reaction to this, Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our interpretation of it is that people desperately want to see Olivia and Peter together. And that Fauxlivia having a baby makes Olivia’s life that much harder and people are angry because of that. Anything that makes Olivia’s life harder, people seem to be angry at. Olivia is a hero, she will conquer all. She’ll deal." [...] After [...] "Immortality" [...] aired, Joshua Jackson expressed sympathy for fans of the Olivia-Peter relationship, commenting that they [...] "have been taken for quite a ride. He [...] wants to be with her , and in his mind it was her. But in her mind, he should have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the difference." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1997, {{there was}} a {{controversial}} change {{from the use of}} the former British Airways branding (which incorporated stylised elements of the Union Jack) to a new livery which was intended mainly to reflect the diversity of places served by the airline – so-called [...] "World Images". This involved a range of different designs appearing on tailfins and elsewhere, although the bodies of all the planes would use the corporate colours consistently; the exception was the Concorde fleet, which would have a new tailfin design based on a stylised, fluttering Union flag. What became known as the [...] "ethnic images" [...] included Delftware or Chinese calligraphy, related to countries on the company's network of routes. This was reported to have caused problems with air traffic control: previously controllers had <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> pilots to follow a BA plane, but they were now harder to visually identify. Several people spoke out against the change, including the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who famously covered the tail of a model 747 at an event with a handkerchief, to show her displeasure. BA's traditional rival, Virgin Atlantic, took advantage of the negative press coverage by applying the Union flag to the winglets of their aircraft along with the slogan [...] "Britain's national flagcarrier". In 1999 the CEO of British Airways, Bob Ayling, announced that all BA planes would adopt the tailfin design originally intended to be used only on the Concorde, based on the Union Flag.|$|E
2500|$|With two {{different}} sets of players competing in performance and two producers with conflicting views on how to approach each song, the sessions were far from disciplined. Years later, when asked about Time Out of Mind, Dickinson replied, [...] "I haven't <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> what's actually happening. I know they were listening to playbacks, I don't know whether {{they were trying to}} mix it or not!

2500|$|With accompaniment by {{experimental}} rock guitarist Gary Lucas, Buckley performed [...] "I Never Asked To Be Your Mountain", a song Tim Buckley {{wrote about}} an infant Jeff Buckley and his mother. Buckley {{returned to the}} stage to play [...] "Sefronia– The King's Chain", [...] "Phantasmagoria in Two", and concluded the concert with [...] "Once I Was" [...] performed acoustically with an impromptu a cappella ending, due to a snapped guitar string. Willner, the show's organizer, later recalled that Buckley's set closer made a strong impression. Buckley's performance at the concert was counter-intuitive to his desire to distance himself musically from his father. Buckley later explained his reasoning to Rolling Stone: [...] "It wasn't my work, it wasn't my life. But it bothered me that I hadn't been to his funeral, that I'd never <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him anything. I used that show to pay my last respects." [...] The concert proved to be his first step into the music industry that had eluded him for years.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Johanan {{interpreted}} the words, [...] "A light ( [...] , tzohar) shall you {{make to the}} Ark," [...] in [...] to teach that God instructed Noah to set therein luminous precious stones and jewels, {{so that they might}} give light as bright as noon ( [...] , tzaharayim). Similarly, Rav Achava bar Zeira taught that when Noah entered the Ark, he brought precious stones and jewels with him to keep track of day and night. When the jewels shone dimly, he knew that it was daytime, and when they shone brightly, he knew that it was night. The Gemara noted that it was important for Noah {{to be able to tell}} day from night, for some animals eat only during the day, and others east only during the night, and thus Noah could determine the proper feeding times for the animals under his care. The Gemara noted that if in [...] God told Noah, [...] "A window shall you make to the ark," [...] then Noah should have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> day from night. The Gemara explained that Noah needed the jewels because the account of Noah bringing jewels into the Ark followed the view that the celestial bodies — including the sun — did not serve during the year of the Flood. (Thus, no sunlight entered the Ark, and [...] must refer to jewels rather than a window.). Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2011[...]|$|E
