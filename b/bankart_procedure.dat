40|$|Abstract Purpose Both {{open and}} arthroscopic Bankart repair are {{established}} {{procedures in the}} treatment of anterior shoulder instability. While the open procedure is still considered as the "golden standard" functional outcome is supposed to be better in the arthroscopic procedure. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the functional outcome between open and arthroscopic Bankart repair. Materials and methods In 199 patients a <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedure</b> with suture anchors was performed, either arthroscopically in presence of an detached, but not elongated capsulolabral complex (40) or open (159). After a median time of 31 months (12 to 67 months) 174 patients were contacted and agreed to follow-up, 135 after open and 39 after arthroscopic <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedure.</b> Results Re-dislocations occurred in 8 % after open and 15 % after arthroscopic <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedure.</b> After open surgery 4 of the 11 re-dislocations occurred after a new adequate trauma and 1 of the 6 re-dislocations after arthroscopic surgery. Re-dislocations after arthroscopic procedure occured earlier than after open Bankart repair. An external rotation lag of 20 ° or more was observed more often (16 %) after open than after arthroscopic surgery (3 %). The Rowe score demonstrated "good" or "excellent" functional results in 87 % after open and in 80 % patients after arthroscopic treatment. Conclusion In this retrospective investigation the open <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedure</b> demonstrated good functional results. The arthroscopic treatment without capsular shift resulted in a better range of motion, but showed a tendency towards more frequently and earlier recurrence of instability. Sensitive patient selection for arthroscopic Bankart repair is recommended especially in patients with more than five dislocations. </p...|$|E

If an open <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedure</b> was performed, a failed subscapularis repair may be the etiology for symptoms.|$|E
30|$|The {{physical}} exam {{should focus on}} range of motion, strength, stability, and laxity testing, with comparisons to the contra-lateral side. Range of motion should assess flexion, abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, and external rotation at 90 degrees of abduction {{in order to identify}} potential stiffness. In addition, excessive external rotation may suggest a subscapularis tear or redundant anterior capsule. Strength testing should particularly evaluate the rotator cuff, as concomitant tears are not infrequently associated [37]. Particular attention to the subscapularis muscle function is warranted after a failed open <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedure,</b> with assessment of a belly press and lift-off test [27].|$|E
40|$|To assess capsulolabral lesions {{present in}} {{patients}} after unsuccessful arthroscopic procedures, we re-viewed {{the records of}} 20 patients who had undergone open shoulder procedures after unsuccessful arthro-scopic <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedures</b> for chronic shoulder insta-bility.

Five of the 20 patients (25 %) had reinjuries to the shoulder after the arthro-scopic procedure. The average time from the arthro-scopic to the open procedure was 17. 9 months.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} clinical outcomes, rate of recurrence, complications, and range of movement after remplissage, Weber osteotomy, humeral allograft reconstruction, shoulder arthroplasty, and hemiarthroplasty in patients with anterior or posterior shoulder instability associated with humeral bone loss. METHODS: A systematic review of published studies on the management of dislocation of the shoulder with humeral bony procedures was performed. A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Medline, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar databases was performed using various combinations of the keywords "shoulder," "dislocation," "treatment," "remplissage," "hemiarthroplasty," "arthroplasty," "allograft," "osteotomy," "bone," "loss," "clinical," "outcome," and "Hill Sachs" since inception of the databases to 2014. The following data were extracted: demographic characteristics, bone defects and other lesions, type of surgery, outcome measurement, range of motion, recurrence of instability, and complications. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included, in which 769 shoulders were evaluated. The mean value of the Coleman Methodology Score was 69. 2 points. Preoperatively, the most detected injuries were Hill-Sachs and Bankart lesions. Shoulder arthroplasty procedures had the highest rate of postoperative recurrence and the lowest scores for postoperative clinical outcomes. The combination of remplissage and <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedures</b> was associated with a lower rate of recurrence when compared with Bankart repair alone (odds ratio, 0. 05; 95...|$|R
40|$|Background & Objectives: Over 150 {{different}} surgical {{techniques for}} treatment of anterior shoulder instability {{has been suggested that}} there is no consensus in the orthopedics. This study seeks to compare treatment outcomes of arthroscopic Bankart lesion repair methods with Bristow - Latarjet open surgical technique in patients with anterior shoulder instability.   Methods: In this cross-sectional study all patients with recurrent shoulder dislocation from 2009 - 2011 was divided into two groups, arthroscopic Bankart treatment (28 cases) and open Bristow - Latarjet (26 cases) that all were treated by one orthopedic surgeon. Patients were visited in 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks also in the third and sixth month post-op. The visual analog scale (VAS) for patient satisfaction and Walsch-duplay and Rowe score for functional outcomes of treatment were used in six months follow up. These three criteria were analyzed again after recalling the patients.   Results: Mean age of 54 patients was 29. 46 ± 9. 16 years and mean follow-up duration was 23. 28 ± 6. 2 months. Scores of patients in both groups were not statistically different after analyzing the functional outcomes of treatment by Walsch-duplay and Rowe score after six months and final follow-up. Scores of patients by Walsch-duplay measurement in arthroscopic Bankart and Bristow-Latarjet groups were 98. 03 ± 4. 37 and 97. 88 ± 4. 51 respectively and by Rowe index were 97. 32 ± 5. 52 vs. 97. 88 ± 4. 51 at final follow-up. No recurrence was observed in both groups in final follow up. Patient satisfaction in Bankart and operation groups were 9. 4 ± 0. 68 and 9. 47 ± 0. 58 (p= 0. 69).   Conclusion: In anterior shoulder instability, minimally invasive Arthroscopic <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedures</b> almost equal to open Bristow-Latarjet method with regards to shoulder stability, recurrence rate, and range of motion...|$|R
40|$|Background: The open Bankart {{technique}} for posttraumatic recurrent anterior instability {{has become the}} procedure of choice for patients who {{do not respond to}} nonoperative treatment. Hypothesis: The open <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedure</b> renders stable and well-functioning shoulders in the long term in a large proportion of patients. Study Design: Retrospective follow-up study with independent reexaminers. Methods: Fifty-four patients (54 shoulders) with symptomatic, posttraumatic, recurrent anterior shoulder instability underwent an open Bankart reconstruction procedure with suture anchors. All of the patients had a Bankart lesion. Forty-seven patients (87 %) were reexamined by independent observers at a mean follow-up period of 69 months (range, 48 to 114). Results: The recurrence rate, including both dislocations and subluxations, was 17 % (8 of 47). The median Rowe score was 90 points (range, 24 to 100) at the follow-up, and the median Constant score was 88. 5 points (range, 41 to 100). External rotation in abduction was a median of 90 ° (range, 25 ° to 125 °) in the involved shoulders, as compared with 97. 5 ° (80 ° to 125 °) in the noninjured shoulders (P 0. 0001). Conclusions: We conclude that, in the long term, the open <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedure</b> resulted in an unexpectedly high number of patients with failure in terms of stability. These results emphasize the importance of performing long-term follow-up studies after surgical reconstruction for unidirectional, posttraumatic, anterior shoulder instability using any type of technique...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} on arthroscopic treatment of chronic anterior shoulder instability were {{the collection of the}} current practices for this indication, their development as reported in the literature, and the analysis of preliminary results on a multicenter prospective series of <b>Bankart</b> arthroscopic <b>procedures</b> undertaken using a common technique on patients selected based on the Instability Severity Index Score (ISIS). This procedure predominates in the English-speaking world, whereas the Latarjet protocol is preferred in France. The choice between the two seems to be cultural since neither technique could be demonstrated to be superior in an analysis of 171  responses to an Internet questionnaire in this study. The literature reports disappointing results in the <b>Bankart</b> arthroscopic <b>procedure</b> and recent articles have researched the predictive factors for its failure. Eleven centers prospectively included 125  patients from 1  December  2007 to 30  November  2008. The inclusion criteria were recurrence of anterior instability and an ISIS {{less than or equal to}} four points out of 10. All the selected patients underwent capsuloligamentous reinsertion with a common minimal technique of at least three anchors and four sutures with the same postoperative protocol. At a mean follow-up of 18  months, four patients (3. 2 %) had experienced recurrence. For the 84  patients reexamined at 1  year, the Walch-Duplay and Rowe scores were, respectively, 88. 4 and 87. 8  points out of 100. Subjectively, 88. 1 % of the patients declared they were satisfied and would undergo the intervention again. This study confirmed the use of the ISIS as a consultation tool. Only continuation of the study with a minimum follow-up of 3  years will allow us to validate the lower limit of the ISIS below which this technique could be proposed provided that it respects the technical prerequisite of at least four capsuloligamentous sutures.

40|$|SummaryOsseous lesions of the glenoid {{cavity and}} humeral head are {{predictive}} of recurrence after <b>Bankart</b> arthroscopic <b>procedures.</b> The {{objective of this}} study was to analyze, for each glenoid and humeral defect plain x-ray criteria of the Instability Severity Index Score (ISIS), two aspects: inter- and intraobserver reliability of their qualitative and quantitative assessment and correlations between positive criteria and their quantitative measurement. Thirty-one medical files were retained for evaluation of the glenoid and 26 for humeral notch assessment. The yes or no response for the ISIS criterion was completed by its quantitative measurement using the Griffiths and Sugaya CT methods for the glenoid and the P/R index calculation on plain x-rays with internal rotation for the Hill-Sachs lesion. Three observers provided two consecutive readings for each criterion. The analysis of the glenoid radiological criterion of the ISIS seems sufficiently reproducible for daily practice. When the evaluation is positive, bone loss is greater than 15 %, without a maximum value established. In this study, the analysis of the ISIS humeral notch criterion was not reproducible. It can be improved using the P/R index and should be completed by CT imaging. Level of evidenceLevel IV: retrospective diagnostic study...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} use of anchors with double and single-thread loading in the single-row <b>Bankart</b> arthroscopic <b>procedure.</b> METHODS: 252 {{patients}} (258 shoulders) underwent Bankart arthroscopic surgery with evaluation after a minimum follow-up of 2 years.

40|$|Abstract—Successful {{outcome of}} a <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedure</b> depends on {{knowledge}} {{of the effects of}} capsulolabral lesions on joint biomechanics. The joint reaction force, through “con-cavity compression, ” is integral to glenohumeral stability. In this study, we applied loads to the tendons of the rotator cuff and deltoid (anterior and middle portions) of five cadaver upper limbs. The joint reaction force was measured with a 6 ° of freedom load cell for the intact condition and each of two test conditions: (1) incision and (2) partial resection of the anteroinferior capsulolabrum. We used analysis of variance to compare joint reaction forces resolved into that which is directed perpendicular (compression force), anterior, and supe-rior to the glenoid. Compression force for the two different capsulolabral lesions of the glenohumeral joint was the same, 133 N ± 13 N, a small 12 % decrease compared to the intact condition (151 N ± 13 N). This difference was not statistically significant. Results were similar for the components of the joint reaction force directed anterior and superior. Joint reaction force was not meaningfully altered after anteroinferior capsulolabral lesions were simulated.

40|$|Purpose: Our {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} the relationship between number of preoperative shoulder dislocations and total dislocation time and the need to perform bone deficiency procedures at the time of primary anterior instability surgery. Our hypothesis was that need for bone deficiency procedures would increase with the total number and hours of dislocation. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was performed of primary instability surgeries performed by a single surgeon. Patients with 25 % glenoid bone loss were treated with Latarjet reconstruction. Number of dislocations and total dislocation time were examined for their relationship with the treatment method. Results: Ten arthroscopic Bankart repairs, 13 arthroscopic <b>Bankart</b> plus remplissage <b>procedures,</b> and 9 Latarjet reconstructions were available for review. Total dislocations (P = 0. 012) and total hours of dislocation (P = 0. 019) increased from the Bankart, to the remplissage, to the Latarjet groups. Patients with a total dislocation time of 5 h or more were more likely to require a Latarjet reconstruction (P = 0. 039). Patients with only 1 preoperative dislocation were treated with an isolated Bankart repair in 64 % (7 of 11) of cases, whereas those with 2 or more dislocations required a bone loss procedure in 86 % (18 of 21) of cases (P = 0. 013). Conclusion: Increasing number of dislocations and total dislocation time are associated with the development of glenoid and humeral head bony lesions that alter surgical management of anterior shoulder instability. The necessity for the addition of a remplissage to an arthroscopic Bankart repair or the use of a Latarjet reconstruction increases with only 1 recurrent dislocation.

40|$|Eponymous {{terms are}} used {{frequently}} in daily patient care and scientific literature. They {{remind us of}} our predecessors in surgery. It is debatable whether eponymous terms are reliable in case of information transfer. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} whether the original meaning of eponymous terms in shoulder and elbow surgery has been preserved in its use in contemporary literature. To evaluate whether eponymous terms were used correctly, we analysed the use of frequently encountered eponymous terms from January to December 2014. By means of a PubMed search, articles with eponymous terms were identified and analysed for the way an eponymous term was used, and we compared it with the original description. The original description was traced back to the index publication. The use of the eponymous term was scored as similar, divergent or undefined. In the search for eponymous terms, we included those eponymous terms that were used more than 10 times in the English, German and Dutch literature of 2014. 6 eponymous terms were eligible for analysis: <b>Bankart</b> lesion, Bristow-Latarjet <b>procedure,</b> Essex-Lopresti injury of the forearm, Galeazzi fracture, Hill-Sachs lesion and Monteggia fracture. We analysed 96 articles with the listed eponymous terms, of which 27 (28 %) were scored divergent, 32 (33 %) undefined and 37 (39 %) similar. Bristow-Latarjet scored lowest, with 0 % descriptions similar to the original, meaning that all articles had an undefined or divergent eponym, and Essex-Lopresti scored highest with 82 % similarity. Eponymous terms in shoulder and elbow trauma and surgery are used inadequately and inconsistently.

At follow-up after a mean of 31. 2 months (24 to 52) 19 (14. 5 %) had recurrent instability. The following risk factors were identified: patient age under 20 years at the time of surgery; involvement in competitive or contact sports or those involving forced overhead activity; shoulder hyperlaxity; a Hill-Sachs lesion present on an anteroposterior radiograph of the shoulder in external rotation and/or loss of the sclerotic inferior glenoid contour. These factors were integrated in a 10 -point pre-operative instability severity index score and tested retrospectively on the same population. Patients with a score over 6 points had an unacceptable recurrence risk of 70 % (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Shoulder {{dislocation}} affects approximately 1300 {{person per}} year in Norway. The dislocation is normally caused by a fall on the outstretched arm. Many of the patients develop chronic recurrent instability, where the shoulder joint re-dislocates during sport activity or daily living. Other patients experience habitual chronic instability without an initial trauma. The current thesis has evaluated the surgical treatment of shoulder instability {{using data from the}} Norwegian Shoulder Instability Register that was established {{as a part of the}} project. The results are published in three papers. In Paper I we reported that the annual incidence rate of shoulder stabilisation surgery was 12 per 100. 000 inhabitants. Compared to the annual incidence of shoulder dislocations approximately 40 % of the patient with a primary dislocation underwent surgery. Anterior instability accounted for 83 % of the procedures whereas posterior and multi-directional instability constituted 10 % and 7 % respectively. An arthroscopic labral repair (Bankart) was performed in 88 % of the patients with primary anterior instability. In revision cases an open technique was used for 50 % of the patients and coracoid transfer (Latarjet) was the dominating technique performed with an open approach. There was a significant improvement of the functional score for all patient groups. Primary anterior Bankart had a 1 -year outcome of 75 % on the WOSI score and a recurrence rate of 10 %. Patients with posterior instability had a slightly worse WOSI score at follow-up (63 %), and a recurrence rate of 16 %. In Paper II we investigated if postoperative prescription of non-steroid anti- inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs, had any effect on the outcome after arthroscopic Bankart. In total only one third of the patients were treated with NSAIDs in the postoperative phase. The outcome for patients treated with and without NSAIDs did not differ after a mean follow up of 21 months. WOSI score was 75 % and recurrence rate 12 % for patient with NSAID treatment. For the control group the corresponding figures were 74 and 14 %. Reoperation rates were 5 % in both groups. 43 % of the patients treated with an arthroscopic Bankart had an ambulatory procedure. 54 % of the outpatients had non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs, prescribed post-operatively, compared to 19 % of the inpatients. The result implies that postoperative use of NSAID in moderate dosages does not affect the outcome of arthroscopic Bankart and that it may facilitate ambulatory surgery. In paper III the outcomes of arthroscopic Bankart and open Latarjet were compared. After a mean 2. 7 years follow-up we found a significantly higher recurrence rate of 17 % after arthroscopic Bankart, compared to 7 % after open Latarjet. There was a significant improvement but no difference between the treatment groups in the functional outcome, with a WOSI score of 74 % for arthroscopic Bankart and 75 % for Latarjet. Patients with recurrence of instability did not improve their score. Item analysis of the WOSI score indicated that patient with a Latarjet felt more secure on the stability of their shoulder, but had a lower score on mobility. In multiple logistic regression analysis the risk of recurrence after arthroscopic Bankart was further emphasised, with an odds ratio (OR) of 12. 8 (CI 95 %: 1. 45 - 113, p= 0. 002). Age below 20 years at time of surgery was a risk factor for recurrence after both procedures (OR 2. 24, CI 95 %: 1. 36 - 3. 69, p= 0. 002). A combination of glenoid bone loss and an engaging Hill Sachs lesion was a risk factor for recurrence after arthroscopic Bankart (OR 12. 6, CI 95 %: 1. 61 - 98, p= 0. 014), but not after a Latarjet procedure. WOSI for revision patients was 67 % for arthroscopic Bankart and 65 % for Latarjet at follow-up, with recurrence rates of 24 vs. 17 %. WOSI-score was significantly lower for revisions compared to primary procedures (p< 0. 05), but there was no statistical significant difference between the two techniques. This thesis supports previous studies that have shown a high recurrence rate after arthroscopic <b>Bankart.</b> The Latarjet <b>procedure</b> had significantly fewer recurrence events, despite a higher proportion of patients with bone loss. Still, there was no difference in the functional outcome, indicating that there may be other drawbacks with this treatment. Patients with bone loss, especially when present on both the humerus and glenoid, seem to profit on treatment with a Latarjet procedure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{detailed}} computer-assisted {{evaluation of}} eighty-nine patients whose shoulders were surgically treated for anterior instability was done. Three types of anterior instability {{of the shoulder}} were identified: Type I, subluxation without priOr dislocation; Type II, recurrent dislocation with interval subluxation; and Type III, recurrent dislocation without interval sub luxation. -This series included fifty patients with Type-I, twenty-nine with Type-Il, and ten patients with Type-Ill instability. Selected variables from the computer analysis of forty-five preoperative and post operative parameters {{were related to the}} type of insta bihity diagnosed preoperatively. The surgical proce dure used in all shoulders was a modification of the <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedure.</b> Chronic glenohumeral instability is a disabling entity which can be controlled by surgical stabilization of the anterior capsule to the glenoid rim. Stability of the glenohumeral joint is essential for ef fective overhead function of the upper extremity. Recur rent dislocation is generally considered to be the major type of instability of surgical significance. Only a few au thors have written about the instability of subluxation, which is not usually considered to be a cause of shoulder instability amenable to surgical correction 2 ' 6. The largest reported number of surgically treated shoulders with an tenor instability that did not have roentgenographically documented dislocation is twenty, and even these were presumed by the authors to have been transient di...|$|E
40|$|Australian Rules {{football}} (ARF) is {{a potentially}} violent, over-head, body-contact sport. We reviewed 56 shoulders {{in patients who}} sustained their initial traumatic anterior subluxation or dislocation during ARF and who underwent reconstructive surgery for traumatic anterior instability, whether by arthroscopic or by open techniques. Patients were followed up for a mean of 29. 4 months after operation, and clinical evaluation was performed with the Rowe grading system. Three types of surgical procedures were performed: arthroscopic suture repair, arthroscopic Bankart repair with an absorbable polyglyconate tack, and open capsular shift with repair of the Bankart lesion. Shoulders treated with arthroscopic suture repair had a 70 % rate of recurrent subluxation or dislocation on return to ARF. Dislocations treated arthroscopically with the biodegradable tack had a 38 % rate of recurrence of instability; three fourths of the recurrences were after minimal to moderate trauma. Shoulders treated with an open capsular shift and <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedure</b> had a 30 % rate of recurrent instability, {{with half of the}} recurrences caused by violent trauma. In the open group there were no failures in patients who did not return to ARF. We suggest that arthroscopic repair in shoulders with anterior instability and recurrent dislocation does not adequately address the plastic deformation of the anterior capsule that may occur after repeated episodes of dislocation. We advocate open shoulder procedures in ARF athletes to address all areas of the capsulolabral pathologic condition and to provide the most secure repair possible with minimal chance of recurrence.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effects of {{coracoid}} bone block (modified Latarjet) procedure on clinical and functional results in cases with glenoid bone defect accompanied with anterior shoulder instability. Methods: The study included 35 patients (average age: 35 years; range: 20 to 58 years) with glenoid bone defect and recurrent dislocations treated with the modified Latarjet procedure. There were 12 sports injuries, 5 post-epileptic cases and 18 recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation following non-sports-related injuries. Recurrence was reported in 7 patients formerly treated with the <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedure.</b> Average number of preoperative dislocations was 10. 8 ± 6. 5 and average time range between the first dislocation and surgery was 14. 9 ± 13. 2 months. All patients underwent preoperative diagnostic arthroscopy. Postoperative isometric exercises in braces were assigned for the first 6 weeks, followed by active strengthening exercises. Pre- and postoperative functional results were evaluated using the ASES (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons) and Rowe scores and pain using the VAS (Visual Analog Scale). Results: Osseous union of coracoid graft was achieved in all patients. Average follow-up was 24 ± 12. 2 (range: 12 to 74) months. No degenerative arthritis or continuing instability was detected in any of the patients. Average forward flexion was 165 °± 20 ° and external rotation 59 °± 13 °. Mean preoperative ASES and Rowe scores of 49. 6 ± 10. 6 and 47. 9 ± 21. 5 increased postoperatively to 91. 3 ± 11 and 89. 1 ± 9. 2, respectively. Mean VAS scores decreased significantly from 6. 2 ± 2. 4 to 1. 8 ± 0. 6 postoperatively (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Shoulder functionality and former activity levels can be successfully achieved in terms of increased patient satisfaction through use of the modified Latarjet surgery in the treatment of glenoid bone defect and anterior shoulder instability...|$|E
30|$|As for {{clinical}} implications, the detailed anatomic {{findings of the}} current study of the whole glenohumeral capsule could provide some clues to understand the significance of stabilizing techniques for shoulder instability. Some surgeons have proposed the importance of AIGHL tensioning for stabilization with lifting the AIGHL superiorward in the procedure of Bankart repair.(Blasier et al. 1992; Post 1996) In addition, more recent articles have indicated that the Hill-Sachs remplissage procedure together with the <b>Bankart</b> <b>procedure</b> provide satisfactory biomechanical stabilization and clinical outcomes.(Boileau et al. 2012; Cho et al. 2016; Merolla et al. 2015; Omi et al. 2014) The Bankart repair and remplissage have been thought to have no anatomic relationships, because both techniques affected to different parts of the glenohumeral capsule. In the current study, we revealed that the inferior part of the articular capsule is thicker than the superior part in the whole capsule, and the humeral and glenoid side edges continue superiorly. Bankart repair involves the anterior advance of the glenoid side in the thick inferior capsule. On the other hand, remplissage involves the superior advance of the humeral side of the thick inferior capsule as a continuous membrane (dagger in Fig. 6 a). Based on the current study, these two techniques apply tension to the same structure but at different areas diagonally continued. Thus, these anatomic findings might support the efficacy of the Bankart repair combined with remplissage. However, the question whether the appropriate tension {{can be applied to the}} diagonally continuing capsule still remains. Next, based on the “circle stability concept”, the shoulder capsule has been thought to be damaged on both the posterior and anterior side to allow the complete dislocation. (Bowen and Warren 1991) Taking into consideration of this concept, the anatomical knowledge about the superior thinner part of the capsule could be some clue for understanding the pathomechanism of the anterior instability, differently from the IGHL. Based on the above, the anatomical findings in the current study could then serve as a take off point for further research regarding the pathology of the shoulder instability using the biomechanical and clinical studies.|$|E
