50|$|Powder {{glass beads}} are {{a type of}} {{necklace}} ornamentation. The earliest such beads were discovered during archaeological excavations at Mapungubwe in South Africa, and dated to between 970-1000 CE. Manufacturing of the powder glass beads is now concentrated in West Africa, particularly in the Ghana area. The origins of beadmaking in Ghana are unknown, but {{the great majority of}} powder glass beads produced today is made by Ashanti and Krobo craftsmen and women. Krobo bead making has been documented to date from as early as the 1920s but despite limited archaeological evidence, it is believed that Ghanaian powder glass bead making dates further <b>back.</b> <b>Bead</b> making in Ghana was first documented by John Barbot in 1746. Beads still play important roles in Krobo society, be it in rituals of birth, coming of age, marriage, or death.Powder glass beads are made from finely ground glass, the main source being broken and unusable bottles and a great variety of other scrap glasses. Special glasses such as old cobalt medicine bottles, cold cream jars, and many other types of glasses from plates, ashtrays, window panes - to name only a few - are occasionally bought new, just for the purpose. Pulverized or merely fragmented, and made into beads, these glasses yield particularly bright colours and shiny surfaces. Modern ceramic colourants, finely ground broken beads, or shards of different coloured glasses from various sources can be added to create a great variety of styles, designs and decorative patterns in many different colours. In addition, glass bead fragments of varying sizes, which have traditionally been used for the manufacture {{as well as for the}} decoration of specific types of beads, can now be found in interesting new combinations, and during the past few years in particular, bead makers have taken this tradition yet another step forward by using entire, i.e. whole small beads for making their colourful bead creations.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe weld scallop {{has been}} used for joining T-bars. There are a lot of weld {{scallops}} in shipbuilding. It is difficult to perform scallop welding due to the inconvenient welding position. This results in many problems such as porosity, slag inclusion, etc. In this study, a new method is devised to remove weld scallops by incorporating a Ceramic Backing Material (CBM). The weld scallop is removed by an elongation of the v groove. In order to insert a CBM into the groove without a weld scallop, a wedge-shaped CBM is developed. The top side of the developed CBM is similar to the shape of a general <b>back</b> <b>bead.</b> The bottom surface has a saw-toothed shape for cutting at a suitable length. This can be attached to the root side of a face plate using adhesive tape, just like a general CBM. Welding experiments in normal and abnormal conditions are carried out and the possibility of burn-through is examined. This CBM’s applicability to shipbuilding is verified...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper aims at {{optimizing}} {{the wire}} feed speed against the welding speed during the pulse-MIG (Metal Inert Gas) lap joint fillet weld of 1. 6 mm aluminium alloy typically {{used for the}} light-weight car body. Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments were conducted with various wire feed speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min, and the bead characteristics were evaluated. As shape factors of the weld bead, the bead width, <b>back</b> <b>bead</b> width, and bead cross-section area were measured. According to the weld quality and defined objective functions, the wire feed speed was optimized for various welding speeds. Findings: The wire feed speed that induces the optimum weld quality was found with welding speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min. The optimum lap welding conditions were then suggested for 1. 6 mm aluminium alloy considering the productivity and quality. Research limitations/implications: The optimization will be extended to various aluminium alloys and the optimized results will be stored in the Al welding database of the intelligent welding power source development. Practical implications: With the increase of the welding speed for aluminium sheet welding, the corresponding wire feed speed should increase as well. On the other hand, {{it is clear that}} the maximum value of the objective function has decreased. Originality/value: This research revealed the relationship between the welding speed and the wire feed speed considering the welding productivity and quality. In addition, the criterion to evaluate the degree of weldability during lap welding is suggested according to the quality and objective functions...|$|E

40|$|The fast {{development}} of DNA-encoded chemical libraries (DECL) {{in the past}} 10 years has received great attention from pharmaceutical industries. It applies the selection approach for small molecular drug discovery. Because of the limited choices of DNA-compatible chemical reactions, most DNA-encoded chemical libraries have a narrow structural diversity and low synthetic yield. There is also a poor correlation between the ranking of compounds resulted from analyzing the sequencing data and the affinity measured through biochemical assays. By combining DECL with dynamical chemical library, the resulting DNA-encoded dynamic library (EDCCL) explores the thermodynamic equilibrium of reversible reactions {{as well as the}} advantages of DNA encoded compounds for manipulation/detection, thus leads to enhanced signal-to-noise ratio of the selection process and higher library quality. However, the library dynamics are caused by the weak interactions between the DNA strands, which also result in relatively low affinity of the bidentate interaction, as compared to a stable DNA duplex. To take advantage of both stably assembled dual-pharmacophore libraries and EDCCLs, we extended the concept of EDCCLs to heat-induced EDCCLs (hi-EDCCLs), in which the heat-induced recombination process of stable DNA duplexes and affinity capture are carried out separately. To replace the extremely laborious and repetitive manual process, a fully automated device will facilitate the use of DECL in drug discovery. Herein we describe a novel lab-on-a-chip platform for high throughput drug discovery with hi-EDCCL. A microfluidic system with integrated actuation was designed which is able to provide a continuous sample circulation by reducing the volume to a minimum. It consists of a cooled and a heated chamber for constant circulation. The system is capable to generate stable temperatures above 75 °C in the heated chamber to melt the double strands of the DNA and less than 15 °C in the cooled chamber, to reanneal the reshuffled library. In the binding chamber (the cooled chamber) specific retaining structures are integrated. These hold <b>back</b> <b>beads</b> functionalized with the target protein, while the chamber is continuously flushed with library molecules. Afterwards the whole system can be flushed with buffer to wash out unspecific bound molecules. Finally the protein-loaded beads with attached molecules can be eluted for further investigation...|$|R

Ann realized that sewing four squares of patchwork and taking tea with Jane would leave her with less than enough time to play with Jane. About halfway to Jane’s house, Ann used her handkerchief, and when she put it <b>back</b> into the <b>bead</b> bag containing her patchwork, she purposefully left the bag open and swung it by one string. When Ann arrived at Jane’s house, the bag felt empty, but she ignored the emptiness and played with Jane. In the meantime, the parson’s wife’s sister, her husband, and her daughter Sally were traveling in the area. They picked up Ann Lizy’s patchwork, which Sally decided to put it in her quilt. [...] Eventually, Ann settled down to sew her patchwork and panicked because it was gone. Mrs. Baxter sent Ann and Jane to look for the patchwork, but along the way, Ann Lizy climbed a wall and ended up tearing her best dress. She also lost her grandmother’s embroidered green bag. That night, after Ann returned home, her grandmother scolded her. Ann eased her conscience by confessing she had lost her patchwork on purpose.

40|$|Omega- 3 {{fatty acids}} provide {{significant}} health benefits {{and are a}} popular nutritional supplement in the nutraceuticals industry. Omega- 3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) {{have been reported to}} improve heart health and mental health. In addition, DHA consumption has been tied to improvements in infant cognitive development. Therefore, high-purity DHA is a desired ingredient in the production of infant formula. The omega- 3 oils originating from fish tend to have carcinogenic risks in addition to a bad odor. In recent years, the industry trend has shifted to producing these omega- 3 fatty acids via microalgae species– making it a profitable time to enter the DHA production market. The proposed design is for a plant to cultivate the Schizochytrium cells in the upstream process, and then extract and purify the desired omega- 3 fatty acid oils in the downstream process. The project proposal called for production of 881, 800 lb DHA per year, but our plant has the capacity to produce 1, 148, 000 lb DHA per year at a competitive price of $ 362. 90 per lb of DHA. Clinton, Iowa was chosen as the plant location due to its proximity to the Mississippi River and the Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) plant, allowing for direct access to water and waste disposal. Our process is estimated to have an IRR of 153. 8 % with a NPV of $ 775, 600, 000 and a ROI of 206. 5 %. The process itself begins with fermentation of the microalgae cells, starting with lab-scale fermentors, increasing in size to seed fermentors, and finally scaling up to production fermentor size. Schizochytrium sp. is the strain of heterotrophic microalgae, chosen for its ability to accumulate lipids in high concentration, and its ability to produce DHA triglyceride in high selectivity with respect to other omega- 3 fatty acids. Following fermentation, extraction operations are carried out with a hexane solvent and bead mill to extract the crude oils. The hexane is then evaporated and recycled <b>back</b> to the <b>bead</b> mill. The purification process of the crude oil involves saponification of the triglycerides into fatty acid salts. Acetic acid is then added to convert the salts into the final docosahexaenoic acid product. The saponification and protonation reactions take place in Scheibel columns. The final DHA product is 98 % pure by mass, and will be sent to a pack out station to be packaged into pharmaceutical grade drums for customers...|$|R

It is an important separation technique in the petrochemical industry and {{becomes more and more}} exploited in ?ne chemical, phar maceutical and biotechnical industries. For instance, this attractive technology is used to separate chiral molecules, enzymes, sugar and to purify proteins or to produce insulin. This thesis project is concerned with the analytical and numerical solutions of three stan dard liquid chromatographic models namely, the equilibrium dispersive model (EDM), the lumped kinetic model (LKM) and the general rate model (GRM). Each model consid ers di?erent levels of complexities to describe the process. These models are systems of convection-di?usion partial di?erential equations with dominating convective terms and coupled through di?erential or algebraic equations. The Laplace transformation is applied to derive the analytical solutions of the EDM and LKM considering the special case of single-component linear adsorption isotherm, contin uous or ?nite width pulse injections, two di?erent sets of boundary conditions and fully porous particles. For further analysis of the solute transport behavior, the analytical tem poral moments are derived from the Laplace-transformed solutions and are compared with the numerical solutions of a semi-discrete high resolution ?nite volume scheme (HR-FVS). For nonlinear adsorption isotherms, numerical {{techniques are}} the only tools to provide solu tions. However, the strong nonlinearities of realistic thermodynamic functions pose major di?culties for the numerical schemes. For that reason, computational e?ciency and accu racy of the numerical methods are highly important. The suggested HR-FVS is extended to approximate these nonlinear model equations. The numerical results of the suggested HR-FVS are compared with some other ?nite volume schemes available in the literature. Di?erent case studies are considered covering a wide range of mass transfer kinetics. The results obtained veri?ed the correctness of analytical results and accuracy of the suggested HR-FVS. An interesting aspect of this thesis project is the application of GRM to ?xed-bed chro matographic columns packed with core-shell or fully porous particles. Due to their proven performance and improved availability, core-shell particles are increasingly applied for chro matographic separations. Such particles are useful for highly e?cient and fast separation of complex samples with a reasonably low <b>back</b> pressure. Cored <b>beads</b> provide advantages over fully porous beads, such as reduced di?usional mass transfer resistances in particle macropores and separation times. The concept has improved column e?ciency by shorten ing the di?usion path that molecules have to travel and thus, has improved the di?usional mass transfer kinetics in particle macropores. Once again, both single-component linear and multi-component nonlinear GRM models are considered. The above mentioned ana lytical and numerical solution techniques are applied to solve the model equations. The potential of the solutions is demonstrated by considering di?erent case studies that quan tify the e?ects of the relative core size, axial dispersion, ?lm mass transfer resistance and intraparticle di?usion resistance in the porous layer on the elution curves...|$|R

The tongue is a muscular organ which consists of dorsal and ventral surfaces, it is formed from three parts (apex, body and root). The lingual fossa and torus linguae both appear on the dorsal surface. The total average of the tongue length in adult animals (36. 00 ± 0. 97) cm while the highest average of the length, width and thickness found in the third region. The total length in small ages was (16. 92 ± 0. 98) cm and the highest average of length and thickness again it happens in third region and the highest width in this age group found in the second region. The investigation of the normal anatomical structures of the tongue distinguished four lingual papillae (filiform, fungiform, conical and circumvalate) while the lenticuler papillae absent in both age groups. The filiform and fungiform papillae spread over the dorsal surface and ventro-lateral surface terminat abruptly at the ventro-lateral border forming a distinct straight line from apex to the torus linguae in both ages. The present work reveals that the highest average of filiform papillae in both surface (dorsal and ventro-lateral surface) founds in second region in adult group, while in small group founds in first region. The highest average of fungiform papillae in both surface of both age groups are in the apex of tongue. The highest average of conical and circumvalate papillae in both age group (adult and young) were on torus linguae.

On {{the day of}} the {{experiment}} (day 4 in t in the previous section), take the dish out of the incubator and remove most of the culture medium, such that only the cells in the center well (glass region) is slightly covered in medium. - Add 20 μl of RGD-coated magnetic beads (~ 20 μg of beads) to the center well of the dish by scattering them all over. - Carefully place the <b>beads</b> <b>back</b> into the incubator and leave for 10 minutes to allow for integrin clustering and formation of focal adhesions surrounding the beads. - Remove cells from incubator and rinse it once with PBS. Avoid disturbing cells in the center well. Add and remove PBS gently {{by the side of the}} dish. - Add CO 2 -independent medium to the dish. This is to maintain the pH of the cell culture when it is exposed to the open while under the microscope. - Place the dish in the MTC stage where coils are located. Then place it on the inverted microscope. - Find a single cell that is well transfected with both CFP and YFP plasmids. The cell also needs to have a single bead attached to it. Exclude all cells that are not well transfected, have more than one bead attached, or are in contact with neighboring cells. - After the good cell is found, magnetize the magnetic beads by applying a strong magnetic pulse (~ 1000 G, < 0. 5 ms). - Now that the beads are polarized and magnetized, apply a magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to that of the magnetizing pulse. This will cause the bead to rotate. Input the parameter for MTC. Parameters of stress peak magnitude for FRET analysis are typically 17. 5 Pa (50 G step load) or other magnitudes, where for phase lag analysis is 24. 5 Pa (70 G oscillatory load). - While force is being applied, capture the necessary brightfield or fluorescence images. **FRET imaging and analysis** 1. For FRET imaging, the Dual-View imaging system was used to split the image into two (1344 × 512 pixels each). The top view filters for YFP, while the bottom view filters for CFP. Each image is 1344 × 1024 pixels and simultaneously captures both CFP and YFP activity. - While force is being applied by the MTC, FRET dual-view time course images are captured to monitor the protein-protein interaction within the nucleus before and after force. - After experiments are done and images obtained. A customized Matlab program is used to analyze the data. The program first divides the top (YFP) and bottom (CFP) image in to two separate files. - The region of interest (an individual CB in our case) is then selected. The program crops this region from the CFP and YFP images, then aligns them by cross-correlation. - A binary mask is then created for CFP and YFP images by using Matlab’s “graythresh” function. The binary mask is then multiplied with the fluorescent images generating images that have only the fluorescing region and a black background. - The CFP/YFP ratio value is then calculated for each individual pixel that has been aligned and cross-correlated. An average of the region is obtained and reported. Each image or time point will generate one CFP/YFP value. - Note: More details on the Matlab program has been described by Na S et. al. (14) **Polyacrylamide gels for traction force measurement** 1. Polyacrylamide (PA) gels with 0. 2 μm fluorescent beads embedded within are used to measure the traction force each cell generates. By varying the concentration of bis and acrylamide, different gel stiffness can be obtained. - To prepare PA gels, first smear 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane over the glass surface of a 35 mm glass-bottom-dish using a cotton-tipped swab and let it sit there for 6 min. - Wash it thoroughly with water before applying 100 μl/ dish of 0. 5 % gluteraldehyde for 30 min. - Wash again thoroughly and let them dry. Avoid touching the glass surface throughout the whole gel making procedure. - Determine the bis:acrylamide solution proportions to get the desired substrate stiffness. 0. 6, 2, and 8 kP, corresponds to 0. 06 % bisacrylamide and 3 % acrylamide, 0. 05 % bisacrylamide and 5 % acrylamide, 0. 3 % bisacrylamide and 5 % acrylamide respectively. Prepare 1 ml of each desired mixture in a small 2 ml vial. - Add 10 μl of 0. 2 μm fluorescent beads to the bis-acrylamide mixture. Before adding fluorescent beads, be sure to vortex or sonicate. - Add polymerizing activator/initiator to the beads-bis-acrylamide mixture. 10 % APS at 1 : 200 volume ratio (5 μl in this case). TEMED at 1 : 2000 volume ratio (0. 5 μl in this case). Mix everything together thoroughly. - Add 15 μl of the mixture to the glass surface of the treated dish. (15 μl would give 75 μm thick substrates) - Flatten droplet with a 12 mm circular cover glasses. - Turn the glass bottom dish upside down. This ensures the fluorescent beads to be closer to the top surface. - Place the upside down dishes in a 37 oC incubator for 30 - 45 minutes. Elevated temperature helps in the polymerization. - After the gels are fully polymerized, flood the dish with 100 mM HEPES. Then carefully remove the circular cover glass with a single edge razor. - Make 1 mM solution of SANPAH with DMSO and 100 mM HEPES. Add DMSO to SANPAH first to dissolve the solid powder, and then add it to HEPES. For example, 5 mg SANPAH+ 50 μl DMSO+ 10 ml (100 mM) HEPES. - Take out HEPES from the glass bottom dishes, dab excess HEPES with Kim wipes from around gel edge - Apply 200 μl of SANPAH solution the gel (center well of dish). - Expose surface to UV for 6 min (6 ″ away from the lamp) to photo activate the gel surface. SANPAH color will turn dark. Without SANPAH treatment, collagen will not bind to gel surface. - Rinse off SANPAH with 100 mM HEPES. - Repeat photo activation procedure once more and rinse it off with 100 mM HEPES. - Coat the gel surface with the desired concentration of collagen and incubate at 4 ° C overnight. - Before seeding cells onto the gel surface, sterilize it under UV light for 10 - 15 minutes. - PA gels can be stored in PBS at 4 ° C for three weeks. - Note: To determine the ratio of bis to acrylamide for desired substrate stiffness, refer to references (23 - 25). **Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) ** 1. Cells are cultured on the PA gels. Depending on the PA gel stiffness, the cell will generate different traction forces, and hence different magnitude of deformation. - Three images need to be captured. First is the brightfield or phase contrast image of the cell which will be used to identify the cell boundary. Second is the fluorescent beads marker image while the cell is still on the substrate. Third is the reference fluorescent beads marker image after the cell has been removed or trypsinized from the gel surface. - A customize Matlab program was used to analyze the traction force generated. The displacement field induced by each individual cell’s tractional forces was determined by comparing the fluorescent bead positions before and after trypsinization (cell-free and thus force-free). - An image correlation method where the flourecent images are divided into small window areas is used to determine the displacement vectors (26). - The root-mean-square (RMS) traction field was then calculated from the displacement field using Fourier Transform Traction Cytometry (FTTC) based on the Boussinesq solution (27). **Cell stiffness measurement** 1. The stress applied to the cell (in Pa) can be calculated from the applied twisting magnetic field (in G) by multiplying the bead constant (in Pa/G) with the applied twisting field (in G). The bead constant reflects the magnetic property of the bead and may differ from batch-to-batch. The beads are calibrated by immersing them in a known viscous fluid, and applying a constant magnetic field while measuring the remnant magnetic field (21). For example, a 50 G applies 17. 5 Pa of stress to the cell if the bead constant is 0. 35 Pa/G(9). - When a cell with a single bead bound to its apical surface is found under the microscope, an oscillatory stress of 0. 3 Hz is applied using the MTC. - The MTC software tracks the displacement coordinates of the magnetic bead and saves them in a text file. - By quantifying the magnetic bead displacement, and the bead embedded area, the cell complex modulus can be estimated. A custom Matlab program is then used to calculate the cell stiffness. - The beads whose displacement waves are synchronized to the input sinusoidal signals were selected. This is to filter out spontaneous movements of the beads or microscope stage shifts. - Beads with displacements less than 5 nm (detectable resolution) and loosely bound beads were not selected for analysis. To increase the signal to noise ratio, the peak amplitude of the displacement was averaged over 5 consecutive cycles for each cell. - The complex stiffness is calculated using the equation G*=T/d. For each bead, the elastic stiffness G’ (the real part of G*) and the dissipative stiffness G” (the imaginary part of G*) was calculated based on the phase lag. The measured stiffness has the units of torque per unit bead volume per unit bead displacement (Pa/nm). - A finite element model is then used to convert the cell stiffness (Pa/nm) to modulus (Pa) based on the bead to cell surface contact (28) (Figure. 1). ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") *Figure 1. Quantification of magnetic bead embedment in HeLa cells. An RGD-coated bead was bound to the apical surface of the cell for ~ 15 minutes before it was fixed and stained with phalloidin. Integrin-mediated focal adhesions form around the bead-cell contact area, giving rise to an actin ring. The bead embedment was estimated by measuring the actin ring diameter from the fluorescent image and comparing it to the bead diameter from the brightfield image (double arrows). Bead embedment in HeLa cells is 20 - 30 %. Scale bar = 10 μm*. 9. More details on how to calculate cell stiffness have been described by Fabry B et. al. (29). **Phase lag quantification** 1. An oscillatory stress (0. 3 Hz or 0. 83 Hz) is applied to a cell that is well transfected, similar to the stress used to measure cell stiffness - Time course images of the bead, CFP labeled protein, and YFP labeled protein are captured while the cyclic force is being applied. - A custom Matlab program is used to analyze the images and the displacement of bead, CFP and YFP labeled proteins are determined. The phase lag of fluorescent proteins to the bead is then calculated. - One complete cycle of stress corresponds to 360 o. For example, at 0. 3 Hz, the period for one complete cycle is 3. 33 s. If CFP lags behind the bead displacement by 0. 3 s, that will correspond to a phase lag of ~ 32 o. **Mean Square Displacement (MSD) ** 1. For CB dynamics, an oscillatory stress (0. 3 Hz) needs to be applied. Fluorescent images used for MSD analysis were obtained using single-view fluorescence filter. - Time course images of the bead, CFP labeled protein, and YFP labeled protein are captured before, during and after the cyclic force is being applied. - Binary images of the bead, CFP and YFP are obtained by using the “graythresh” Matlab function. The centroid coordinates of the bead and each fluorescing protein are then obtained. - The coordinates of each fluorescence particle obtained was then used to calculate the mean square displacement (MSD) of Coilin and SMN. The MSD before, during, and after mechanical loading were calculated using a customized Matlab program based (15). The same procedure is performed on bright-field images to obtain the bead MSD. ### Timing Preparation for experiments takes up to 3 days. Dishes need to be coated with collagen or other matrix proteins. Beads need to be coated with RGD or ligands to integrins. Cells need to be transfected. Depending on the transfection efficiency and how magnetic beads bind to the cell surface, locating an appropriate cell for data collection may take up sometime. The whole process of making PA gels may take a day (excluding incubation time...|$|R
