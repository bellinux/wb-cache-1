40|$|Abstract：A kind of {{compound}} catalyst {{containing the}} main activate component CuO, the second activate component ZrO 2 and electronic promoter La 2 O 3 was prepared. It was applicable to treat with high-concentration dimethyl acetylsuccinate (DMAS) production wastewater with catalytic wet air oxidation technology {{which was used}} in continuous bubble columns reactor. In this article the influences of concentration of soaked liquid of every component and the second activate component were studied, and the best preparation condition has been determined. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} catalyst of CuO-ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 /ZSM- 5 had a higher activity when handling high-concentration DMAS production wastewater. With this catalyst the CODcr removal rate could get 98. 7 % while non-catalyst only 35. 8 ％ at the reaction conditions as follows: reaction temperature 240, reaction pressure 3. 5 MPa, liquor space velocity＝ 2. 0 h- 1, V（oxygen）：V（wastewater）＝ 250 : 1 and influent wastewater pH= 7. With the rapid development of industrial technology and the expanding scale of production, all kinds of industrial wastewater containing high concentrations of refractory organic chemical and biological pollutants, nitrogen compounds, suspended solids increases by gradually. Because the conventional <b>biological</b> <b>purification</b> <b>methods</b> can not meet the purification’s technical and economic requirements, such a kind of high concentration of industrial wastewater purification in recent years has gradually become one of the hot research topics of an international environmental protectio...|$|R
40|$|Neural {{stem cells}} (NSC) can be {{isolated}} {{from a variety}} of adult tissues and become a valuable cell source for the repair of peripheral and central nervous diseases. However, their origin and identity remain controversial because of possible de-differentiation/transdifferentiation or contaminations by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We hypothesize that the commonly used NSC culture medium can induce committed cartilage chondrocytes to de-differentiate and/or trans-differentiate into neural cell lineages. Using a <b>biological</b> isolation and <b>purification</b> <b>method</b> with explants culture, we here show that adult rat clavicle cartilage chondrocytes migrate out from tissue blocks, form sphere-like structures, possess the capability of self-renewal, express nestin and p 75 NTR, markers for neural crest progenitors, and differentiate into neurons, glia, and smooth muscle cells. Comparing with adult cartilage, the spherical-forming neural crest cell-like cells downregulate the chondrocytic marker genes, including collagen II, collagen X, and sox 9, as well as neural-lineage repressors/silencers REST and coREST, but upregulate a set of well-defined genes related to neural crest cells and pro-neural potential. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and glial growth factor (GGF) increase glial and neuronal differentiation, respectively. These results suggest that chondrocytes derived from adult clavicle cartilage can become neural crest stem-like cells and acquire neuronal phenotypes in vitro. The possible de-differentiation/trans-differentiation mechanisms underlying the conversion were discussed. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Quantum dots have {{applications}} in biomedical {{fields such as}} bio-imaging and drug delivery systems. This thesis describes research on silicon and germanium nanoparticles (quantum dots) synthesis and surface modification for <b>biological</b> applications. <b>Purification</b> <b>methods</b> of these quantum dots were also explored. In chapter 6 the application of silica nanoparticles into dry eye diagnosis was studied. The purpose {{of this research is}} to contribute the application of nanotechnology into biological fields. The crystalinity of the quantum dots was characterised by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Selected Area Electron Diffraction analysis (SAED). The molecules {{on the surface of the}} quantum dots were characterised by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Silicon quantum dots were synthesised with a microemulsion system and various types of molecules were attached on the surface of the silicon quantum dots. However, some of the capping molecules which have oxygen atoms tend to form bonds between oxygen and silicon. Therefore, in the later chapter (chapter 4) various chemical reactions were conducted on the molecules attached to the silicon quantum dots. The silicon quantum dots were capped with diene molecules and one of the double bonds was left on the terminal end. The terminal end double bonds were converted to the functional groups which contain oxygen atoms to form peptide bonds. In this way it was confirmed that it can reduce the risk of oxygen atoms to be attached on the surface of the silicon quantum dots. The molecules on the surface of the silicon quantum dots were characterised mainly by FTIR and ¹H NMR. Optical properties and cyto-toxicity of these silicon quantum dots were also measured and analysed depending on the surface molecules. Two synthetic approaches were taken to produce germanium quantum dots. The first approach was the microemulsion system at room temperature. Different combinations of the surfactant and capping molecules were tested. For the second approach, high temperature bench top system was applied. In this method the bio-friendly molecules which have high boiling points were chosen as capping agents. The surface molecules were characterised by FTIR spectroscopy. In chapter 6 the synthesis of dye molecules conjugated silica nanoparticles was described. The purpose of this research is to produce biologically safe nanoparticles which can be applied in dry eye diagnosis. Three different dyes were used to conjugate with the silica nanoparticles. Only fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) succeeded in conjugating with the nanoparticles. Optical properties of this sample were measured and compared with the free dye molecule. Also the sample was applied in human eyes to analyse the tear film layer. An overall conclusion and future plans for the research were given in the last chapter.

Several points were tested in this method for recovering DNA efficiently, revealing the following: 1) One μg of genomic DNA was purified from the chicken blood cell samples diluted 50 - 200 times. It could be used for - 5 kb PCR amplification. Genomic DNA from the chicken blood cell samples diluted 1 - 10 times could not be used for PCR amplification. In cattle, genomic DNA was purified from the blood cell samples diluted 1 - 200 times. It could be use for 0. 8 kb PCR amplification. 2) Concerning concentration of sodium sulfite in sample storage, 10 % was acceptable. 3) Drying the filter with the blood cells before purifying improved DNA yield. 4) Conversion from sodium sulfite to vitamin C failed to obtain the genomic DNA from the samples. 5) When the filter with the blood cells was stored for four weeks at room temperature, genomic DNA was purified. We purified the genomic DNAs using this method for 10 yen/sample and from 16 samples at 1 hour.

40|$|Wastewaters of {{the wood}} {{processing}} into groundwood are characterized by increased concentrations of organic contaminants (oils, resin acid, lignin (polymeric phenols), lignin salts (sulphonates, phenoxides), tannins, triglycerides, waxes, free long-chained fatty acids and other). Organic compounds which appear as colour come from extracted lignin, tannins and resin acids. Wood processing effluents are often resistant to degradation using biological methods, and are not removed effectively by conventional physicochemical treatment methods, such as coagulation/flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and ozonation. For processing of those effluents it is often necessary to link different <b>methods</b> of <b>purification,</b> {{and one of the}} alternative methods is sorption. In this work the removal of organic pollutants was tested from effluent of the production of mechanically milled groundwood by using sorption to clinoptilolite tuff and to samples of tuff which were modified using the solutions of cationic surfactant- hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br) of different concentrations. The sorption processes of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide were researched on the clinoptilolite tuff from Turkey (Aegean Region Turkey, Bigadic), which contains more than 70 % of clinoptilolite, and in smaller mass fraction quartz and opal-CT are present. The tested effluent has the following characteristics: chemical oxygen demand (COD) : 13200 mg dm- 3, total organic carbon (TOC) : 3010 mg dm - 3, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) : 470 mg dm- 3, colour: 681 Pt Co, turbidity: 799 NTU, pH 4. 8. All testing was done without the adjustment of pH. The conventional process of pre-processing of effluent by coagulation with aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O) was tested and the application ofHDTMA-modified clinoptilolite tuff with the intention of further decrease in organic burden of wastewater. In the Fig. 1 A the results of the HDTMA uptake onto clinoptilolite tuff are shown, and in Fig. 1 B the pertaining zeta potentials of the samples are shown. HDTMA cations were essentially quantitatively taken up by the clinoptilolite tuff up to loading level of L = 0. 204 mmol g - 1 -(Fig. 1 A). The results of the zeta potential measurements show that the negative surface charge changed to positive after modification with surfactant solutions (Fig. 1 B). HDTMA cations form a stable organophilic coating on the clinoptilolite surface, and above surfactant loading level of 0. 110 mmol g - 1 (isoelectric point), a second layer of HDTMA+ cations reverses the surface charge into positive. The optimal mass concentration of coagulant AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O for the tested wastewater is γ = 0. 8 g dm - 1 (Figs. 2 A and 2 B). Zeta potential of the solution above sediment received by coagulation with AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O of mass concentration γ= 0. 8 g dm - 3 is ζ= - 3. 92 mV. The efficiency of removing the turbidity (Table 1) and COD is η = 67 % (from 799 to 263 NTU) and 54 % (from 13 200 to 6 040 mg dm - 3). The efficiency of removing solved organic carbon and colour is significantlylesser: 22. 7 % (from 3010 to 2322 mg dm- 3) and η = 33. 0 % (from 681 to 457 Pt Co). By processing the solutions received after coagulation with AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O of mass concentration of 0. 8 g dm - 3, with natural tuff and organo-zeolites whose loading are: 0. 074; 0. 123; 0. 164 and 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA, TOC was decreased from γ= 2322 mg dm- 3 to the following: γ= 2042, 1976, 1945, 1907 and 1821 mg dm - 3 and was sorbed: q = 28. 0; 34. 6; 37. 7; 41. 5; and 50. 1 mg g - 1 TOC (Fig. 3 A). Using the sample of organo-zeolite with loading of 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA, the efficiency of removing the organic carbon was improved from η= 22. 7 % to 40. 0 %. The efficiency of discolouring the tested solutions also increases with the change of the surface charge of organo-zeolites from negative to positive(Fig. 3 B). The efficiency of removing the colour by using the natural tuff was improved from η= 33. 0 % to η = 40. 0 %, and by using the organo-zeolite with loading of L = 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA to η= 76. 3 %. In order for the biodegradation of the processes effluents to be tested, the rations of BOD 5 /COD are predetermined (Figs. 4 A and 4 B). According to literature data, the good value of biodegradation is the ratio of BOD 5 /COD higher than 0. 5. The tested effluent was characterized as having particularly poor biodegradation. After processing the effluent with coagulation and organo-zeolite (0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA), the biodegradation has not shown significant improvement. It could be concluded that HDTMA-modified clinoptilolite tuff can be used for discolouring and purification of the examined wastewater in one part of wastewater treatment which combines and some other physicochemical and/or <b>biological</b> <b>purification</b> <b>methods...</b>|$|R
