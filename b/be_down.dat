5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to <b>be</b> <b>down</b> with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E

25|$|The {{capacity}} of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may <b>be</b> <b>down</b> for maintenance. For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as PVC. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided {{on top of the}} water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the surface condenser (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the dissolved gases being removed by a de-aerator through an ejector attached to the condenser.|$|E

25|$|The {{distance}} between the two points was 73 nautical miles, roughly equidistant to that between Liverpool and Douglas. The weather during the Wednesday run was far from suitable, with a strong easterly wind, rain and poor visibility. Ben-my-Chree crossed the mark in excess of , employing lookouts on various vantage points on board, she kept her speed {{for a period of}} approximately 3 hours. By this time the fog horn on the Skull Martin Lightship could be clearly heard, but with visibility reported to <b>be</b> <b>down</b> to less than a mile, it was proving impossible to make the required visual reference to calibrate the speed. The prevailing conditions coupled to the high density of shipping traffic in the area forced an abandonment of the trial. Speed was reduced to , the Ben-my-Chree was swung about, and made passage back to Greenock. The inclement weather lasted into the following day, leading {{to the rest of the}} trials to be held on Friday.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from their}} own 20-yard line, the 49ers began an 11-play drive that ended on a 5-yard {{touchdown}} catch by Bruce from O'Sullivan that cut the Patriots' lead to 27–21. The Patriots responded with a 10-play series of their own; six plays into the drive, Faulk caught a second-down pass and was originally deemed to <b>be</b> <b>down</b> short of the first down, but the Patriots challenged the play and Faulk {{was found to have}} gained the necessary first down yardage. An offensive pass interference penalty on Moss set up a 3rd and 20 that the Patriots did not convert; Gostkowski then hit a 49-yard line field goal to extend the Patriots' lead to 30–21. A third-down sack of O'Sullivan led to a fourth-down interception by O'Neal that gave the Patriots the ball with 2:45 remaining in the game. The 49ers used all of their timeouts during the Patriots' next possession, and after a Patriots punt, the 49ers failed to convert on fourth down to give the Patriots the ball to end the game.|$|E
25|$|The critics {{generally}} {{agreed on the}} improved quality for the third year, but the overall ratings fell notably from previous seasons. Due to complications from her pregnancy, Marcia Cross was put on bed rest. After filming one episode from her own personal bedroom {{she was forced to}} take maternity leave with eight episodes of season three still remaining. It was predicted that the ratings would <b>be</b> <b>down</b> by over 25% since the premiere year. However, for the last three episodes of the season, the rating turned somewhat, and the season ended up with 17.5 million viewers, falling from number four to number ten on the list of most watched shows. While Cross' departure allowed for the much-underused Edie to have more story, fans noticed a decline in the stories during Cross' departure. Stories such as Lynette's emotional affair with restaurant manager Rick, proved unpopular. Furthermore, Susan's contrived triangle with Ian and Mike seemed tiresome to many viewers, particularly in an episode where Susan is lost in the woods. Notable, however, was that the show's rating among viewers age 18–24 increased from the previous season.|$|E

500|$|Following Sonny Bono's {{death in}} a skiing {{accident}} in 1998, Cher delivered a tearful eulogy at his funeral, calling him [...] "the most unforgettable character" [...] she had met. She paid tribute to him by hosting the CBS special Sonny & Me: Cher Remembers, which aired on May 20, 1998. That month, Sonny and Cher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television.
