2500|$|At {{international}} levels, saddle pads {{are usually}} white and square in shape, allowing the pair {{to display a}} sponsorship, national flag, or breeding affiliation. In contrast, riders in show hunters and equitation often use [...] "fitted" [...] fleece pads that are the same shape as the saddle. Girths vary in type, but usually have a contour to give room for the horse's elbows, and many have <b>belly</b> <b>guards</b> to protect {{the underside of the}} horse from its shoe studs when the front legs are tightly folded under.|$|E
5000|$|Up {{until about}} 2005, the {{distribution}} and price of lacrosse style upper pads were extremely inhibitive. Until then, goaltenders generally engaged in [...] "building up". Building up was a common practice, a goalie would buy a set of hockey uppers and add to them. Hockey uppers generally {{do not have enough}} padding to protect from downward shots or from up-bounces from bounce shots, so materials and other pieces of equipment were often added to protect from these, including: Football lineman shoulder pads, hockey shoulder pads, kidney guards, baseball <b>belly</b> <b>guards,</b> sectioned PVC piping (also used in old lacrosse slash guards), and thick cuts of foam. These augmentations were added not only to increase the upper body size of the goalie, but to increase their safety, comfort, but had to still maintain mobility.Since about 2005, the Canadian Lacrosse Association has mandated one-piece unmodified chest protectors for all of its goalies. Because of the price, the team or the minor lacrosse organization often flips the bill for this costly piece of equipment. A legal upper should only stand out from the shoulders at any point by three inches and four inches on the arms.|$|E

50|$|Some girths (those used on jumpers and eventers) have a <b>belly</b> <b>guard</b> (or stud guard), {{to protect}} the belly from being stabbed by {{horseshoe}} studs as the animal tucks his legs up underneath him over a tall obstacle.|$|R
5000|$|Marine otters are {{relatively}} small, and among otters, only the {{oriental small-clawed otter}} is smaller. However the latter species inhabits freshwater sites; thus the marine otter is the smallest exclusively marine mammal on Earth. Lengths range from 83 to 113 cm, not counting the tail of 30 to 36 cm. Weights can range from 3 to 5.8 kg. Their fur is dark brown {{on the back and}} light brown on <b>belly.</b> The <b>guard</b> hairs cover short insulating fur with a grayish color. The fur is coarser and tougher than in sea otters.|$|R
50|$|This {{is one of}} {{the larger}} Australian Pseudomys species, with a body mass of 55 to 90 grams, head and body length of 9 to 12 centimeters, and a tail length of 8 to 11 centimeters. Its fur is grey-brown dorsally, flecked with buff and black, and with a {{distinctly}} paler <b>belly.</b> Dark <b>guard</b> hairs cover the upper portions of the body and give the heath mouse a fluffy appearance. The feet are brown but slightly paler than the body. This mouse is very similar in appearance to the bush rat (Rattus fuscipes), but it can be distinguished by the shape of the posthallucal pad on the foot.|$|R
