5|$|Planning of the ZX Spectrum+ {{started in}} June 1984, {{and it was}} {{released}} in October the same year. This 48KB Spectrum (development code-name TB) introduced a new QL-style case with an injection-moulded keyboard and a reset <b>button</b> <b>that</b> was basically a switch that shorted across the CPU reset capacitor. Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48KB model. It was possible {{to change the system}} boards between the original case and the Spectrum+ case. It retailed for £179.95. A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was available. Early on, the machine outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more usual 5–6% for the older model.|$|E
5|$|The {{system has}} {{two types of}} receivers: radio terminals, which can either be {{hand-held}} or mounted in vehicles, and desktop equipment for control centers. The system will include 40,000 radios throughout the country. Compared to the analog network, the digital radio equipment will be smaller and have options for additional equipment such as hands free, and allow special radios for motorcycles, snowmobiles, boats, undercover activities and smoke diving. Communication can either be performed as one-to-one conversations, group calls for predefined or ad-hoc groups, with radios able {{to be part of}} several groups, or as walkie talkies in areas without network coverage. The digital transmission reduced background noise and allows monitoring terminal identity to prohibit unauthorized use. All radios are equipped with an emergency <b>button</b> <b>that</b> will give priority in the network.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was the {{inclusion}} of a stamina system, which was a measure of the superstars' stamina. The stamina system was measured by a meter on the HUD; the meter decreased when performing a variety of moves. The meter increases, however, when the player does nothing with the superstar or holds down a selected <b>button</b> <b>that</b> increased the stamina, which varied depending on the player's system. When the superstar's stamina was low, the wrestler reacted by moving slower when performing moves, walking, and running. If the meter decreased completely, the superstar fell to the ground until the meter increased. This system is disabled by default for WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 and was disabled until 2K took over the series, with 2K16.|$|E

The pattern of the cloth on the seats was also redesigned, and the head restraints earned an acceptable rating from the IIHS for whiplash protection.|$|E
25|$|By late 1975, {{after years}} of intense {{construction}} the necessary infrastructure was in place. In Aberdeen, at BP's (British Petroleum) headquarters, the Queen pressed the <b>button</b> <b>that</b> would set the whole thing moving. Oil flowed from the rig directly to the refinery at far-away Grangemouth. While many ports have suffered decline, Aberdeen remains busy because of the oil trade and the influx of people connected with the industry, a subsequent rise in property prices have brought prosperity to the area.|$|E
25|$|There is a “HELP” {{phone system}} on campus. This is {{a network of}} {{approximately}} 110 emergency “HELP” phones scattered about campus that are available for people to use if they feel they are in danger or in an uncomfortable situation. These phones are easily recognizable by their bright blue light and have an emergency <b>button</b> <b>that</b> anyone can press which will automatically connect them to the UMass Police Department. This will alert the police to the users exact position and they can send appropriate assistance.|$|E

25|$|The {{final game}} between Jenn Hanna of Ontario and Jennifer Jones of Manitoba {{came down to}} the very last shot. Ontario had control of the game, and looked like they were going to pull if off at the end. However, in the last end they did not have the hammer, meaning Jones would have last rock. Ontario had a rock on the <b>button</b> <b>that</b> was well guarded, and the only way at it was an in-off a rock sitting just outside the house. Jones made this very {{difficult}} shot, which gave her four points and the win.|$|E
25|$|The open valve in the {{ventilation}} system allowed the huge blast wave {{and possibly the}} fire and toxic smoke to enter the second and perhaps {{the third and fourth}} compartments as well. All of the 36 men in the command post located in the second compartment were immediately incapacitated by the blast wave and likely killed. One sailor's body was found embedded in the ceiling of the second compartment. Although the sub was at periscope depth with her radio antennas extended, no one in the command post was able to send a distress signal or press a single <b>button</b> <b>that</b> would initiate an emergency ballast tank blow and bring the submarine to the surface.|$|E
25|$|The ball is {{put into}} play by use of the plunger, a {{spring-loaded}} rod that strikes the ball as it rests in an entry lane, or as in some newer games, by a <b>button</b> <b>that</b> signals the game logic to fire a solenoid that strikes the ball. With both devices {{the result is the}} same: The ball is propelled upwards onto the playfield. Once a ball is in play, it tends to move downward towards the player, although the ball can move in any direction, sometimes unpredictably, due to contact with objects on the playfield or by the player's own actions. To return the ball to {{the upper part of the}} playfield, the player makes use of one or more flippers.|$|E

25|$|Benign fatty tumors {{known as}} lipomas can {{form on the}} mesentery. As the tumor enlarges, it {{stretches}} the connective tissue into a stalk which can wrap around a segment of bowel, typically small intestine, cutting off its blood supply. The tumor forms a <b>button</b> <b>that</b> latches onto the stalk of the tumor, locking it on place, and requiring surgery for resolution. Surgery involves cutting the stalk of the tumor, untwisting the bowel, and removing bowel {{that is no longer}} viable. If the colic is identified and taken to surgery quickly, there is a reasonable rate of success of 50–78%. This type of colic is most commonly associated with ponies, and aged geldings, 10 years and older, probably because of fat distribution in this group of animals.|$|E
25|$|She {{was dressed}} for {{traveling}} and for cold weather. Her hood {{was large and}} round and red but not smooth, — it was corrugated; that is to say, it consisted {{of a series of}} rolls nearly as large as my arm, passing over her head sidewise, growing smaller toward the back until they terminated in a big <b>button</b> <b>that</b> was embellished with a knot of green ribbon. Its general appearance was not unlike that of the familiar, pictorial beehive except that the rolls were not arranged spirally. The broad, white ruffle of her lace cap projected several inches beyond the front of the hood and waved back and forth like the single leaves of a great white poppy, as she nodded emphatically in her discourse.|$|E
25|$|A common sight {{today is}} the highly publicized events in which a celebrity or {{executive}} from a corporation stands behind the NYSE podium and pushes the <b>button</b> <b>that</b> signals the bells to ring. Many consider the act of ringing the bells to be quite an honor and a symbol of a lifetime of achievement. Furthermore, due {{to the amount of}} coverage that the opening/closing bells receive, many companies coordinate new product launches and other marketing-related events to start on the same day as when the company's representatives ring the bell. This daily tradition wasn't always this highly publicized either. In fact, it was only in 1995 that the NYSE began having special guests ring the bells on a regular basis. Prior to that, ringing the bells was usually the responsibility of the exchange's floor managers.|$|E

25|$|The taskbar {{has seen}} the biggest visual changes, where the old Quick Launch toolbar has been {{replaced}} {{with the ability to}} pin applications to taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task buttons. These buttons also enable Jump Lists to allow easy access to common tasks. The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons. To the far right of the system clock is a small rectangular <b>button</b> <b>that</b> serves as the Show desktop icon. By default, hovering over this button makes all visible windows transparent for {{a quick look at the}} desktop. In touch-enabled displays such as touch screens, tablet PCs, etc., this button is slightly (8 pixels) wider in order to accommodate being pressed by a finger. Clicking this button minimizes all windows, and clicking it a second time restores them.|$|E
25|$|Two {{holes at}} the bottom left and right {{indicate}} whether the disk is write-protected and whether it is high-density; these holes are spaced as far apart as the holes in punched A4 paper, allowing write-protected high-density floppies to be clipped into standard ring binders. A notch at top right ensures that the disk is in the correct orientation and an arrow at top left indicating direction of insertion. The drive usually has a <b>button</b> <b>that</b> when pressed ejects the disk {{with varying degrees of}} force, the discrepancy due to the ejection force provided by the spring of the shutter. In IBM PC compatibles, Commodores, Apple II/IIIs, and other non-Apple-Macintosh machines with standard floppy disk drives, a disk may be ejected manually at any time. The drive has a disk-change switch that detects when a disk is ejected or inserted. Failure of this mechanical switch is a common source of disk corruption if a disk is changed and the drive (and hence the operating system) fails to notice.|$|E
25|$|A {{break in}} the case came in 1998, when police noticed that broken {{concrete}} at Miracle Motors, a business owned by Karyn's ex-father-in-law Michael Slover Sr, were similar to concrete blocks used to weigh down Karyn's body. A forensic geologist {{was brought in to}} see if anything on the Slovers' business matched evidence found {{at the scene of the}} crime. The geologist found that not only was the concrete consistent with that found at Miracle Motors, but that evidence found in the abandoned car was also likely from Slover's business. The task force sifted through dirt at Miracle Motors and eventually discovered a metal rivet and a plastic <b>button</b> <b>that</b> fit a pair of Paris Club jeans and a white shirt that Karyn had been wearing the day of her murder. Police also reported finding bones at the scene, but these were not introduced to trial and were believed to have been animal meat bones that came from food fed to two dogs that Slover used to secure the property.|$|E
