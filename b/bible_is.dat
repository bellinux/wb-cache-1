50|$|An {{existing}} {{fragment of}} a 40-line <b>Bible</b> <b>was</b> probably printed around 1458 or earlier, and printed {{with the same}} type. However {{it is believed that}} the fragment is only a trial piece, and that this <b>Bible</b> <b>was</b> never fully printed. It has been suggested that the first few pages of the 36-line Bible (the pages that were not made from Gutenberg's 42-line <b>Bible)</b> <b>were</b> set from the same manuscript used for the 40-line Bible fragment.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} fifteenth century, the <b>Bible</b> <b>was</b> {{translated}} into Catalan again by Bonifaci Ferrer. Ferrer's translation, {{known as the}} Valencian <b>Bible,</b> <b>was</b> printed in 1478 before any <b>Bible</b> <b>was</b> printed in English or Spanish. The prohibition, in Spain and other Catholic countries, of vernacular translations, along with {{the decline of the}} Catalan language until its renaissance in the nineteenth century, explains why there were no translations into Catalan from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century.|$|R

5|$|Biblical Hebrew as {{preserved}} in the Hebrew <b>Bible</b> <b>is</b> composed of multiple linguistic layers. The consonantal skeleton of the text is the most ancient, while the vocalization and cantillation are later additions reflecting a later stage of the language. These additions were added after 600 CE; Hebrew had already ceased {{being used as a}} spoken language around 200 CE. Biblical Hebrew as reflected in the consonantal text of the Bible and in extra-biblical inscriptions may be subdivided by era.|$|E

Eliot's Indian <b>Bible</b> printing project <b>was</b> the largest printing job done in 17th-century Colonial America.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Bible</b> <b>is</b> {{central in}} Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and is crucial {{in the development of}} his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. This is strongly evident in his early writings such as Archeteles (1522) and llarity and Certainty of the Word of God (1522). He believed that man is a liar and only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings light when there is only darkness of error.|$|E

5|$|The Woman's <b>Bible</b> <b>is</b> {{a two-part}} non-fiction book, written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and a {{committee}} of 26 women, published in 1895 and 1898 to challenge the traditional position of religious orthodoxy that woman should be subservient to man. By producing the book, Stanton wished to promote a radical liberating theology, one that stressed self-development. The book attracted {{a great deal of}} controversy and antagonism at its introduction.|$|E
5000|$|Audio Bibles or spoken <b>Bible</b> <b>are</b> <b>Bibles</b> that <b>were</b> {{recorded}} in audio format. They provide the listener {{the ability to}} listen to the Scriptures without being required to look directly at written text. Benefits of audio <b>Bibles</b> <b>are</b> that they allow blind people personal access to the scriptures, and anybody can engage in other tasks while listening to the recordings which frees up time in the day to do other things. With this extra time, the listener can increase exposure to the Bible.|$|R
50|$|The use {{of study}} <b>Bibles</b> <b>is</b> also popular.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Omartian scored {{an audio}} book {{rendition}} of the biblical gospels, called Gospels Come to Life. The audio <b>Bible</b> <b>was</b> read by fellow CCM writer/musician Michael W.

5|$|Another <b>Bible</b> <b>is</b> a turn-based {{strategy}} game {{in which}} players move their characters on tiles and fight enemies. The gameplay loops through three types of segments: preparation for battles, battles, and towns. During the preparation segments, players choose which characters they want to send out, and during the town segments, players buy and sell items and collect information that is required for getting to the next area. Similarly to the numbered Last Bible titles, players can recruit and fuse monsters in Another Bible.

5|$|The Satanic <b>Bible</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} of four books: The Book of Satan, The Book of Lucifer, The Book of Belial, and The Book of Leviathan. The Book of Satan challenges the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, and promotes Epicureanism. The Book of Lucifer holds {{most of the}} philosophy in The Satanic Bible, with twelve chapters discussing topics such as indulgence, love, hate, and sex. LaVey also uses the book to dispel rumors surrounding the religion. In The Book of Belial, LaVey details rituals and magic. He discusses the required mindset and focus for performing a ritual, and provides instructions for three rituals: those for sex, compassion, or destruction. The Book of Leviathan provides four invocations for Satan, lust, compassion, and destruction. It also lists the nineteen Enochian Keys (adapted from John Dee's Enochian keys), provided in both Enochian and translated to English.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The <b>Bible</b> <b>is</b> {{seen as a}} faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work.

But soon the agents realize that the difference between the peaceful religious and the fanatics may not be very much at all.|$|E
