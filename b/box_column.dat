40|$|Summary]: This paper {{studies the}} {{ultimate}} {{strength and ductility}} of short concrete-filled thin-walled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> with local buckling effects using a nonlinear fiber element analysis technique. New effective width formulas for determining the ultimate strengths of steel plates with geometric imperfections and residual stresses in concrete-filled thin-walled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> are incorporated in the fiber element analysis program {{to account for the}} effects of local buckling. The progressive local and post-local buckling is simulated by gradually redistributing the normal stresses within the steel box. Performance indices are employed to quantitatively evaluate the section and ductility performance of composite columns. The effects of local buckling, steel ratios and steel yield strengths on the strength and ductility of concrete-filled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> are investigated. It is demonstrated that local buckling significantly reduces the ultimate strength of thin-walled high-strength steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> filled with concrete. The 4 % limit on the steel ratio or the 0. 2 limit on the steel contribution ratio imposed on composite column sections in current design codes leads to the use of very slender steel plates in concrete-filled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns.</b> It is suggested that the section performance index of concrete-filled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> should be as high as 0. 5 for a better structural performance. The use of high strength steels in concrete-filled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> significantly increases the ultimate strengths of the columns but reduces their ductility...|$|R

The finite element method is used to predict the post-local buckling response of plates restrained by concrete. Geometric imperfections and residual stresses are considered in the analysis.

40|$|Abstract]: Local {{buckling}} {{of steel}} plates reduces the ultimate loads of concrete-filled thin-walled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> under axial compression. The effects of local buckling {{have not been}} considered in advanced analysis methods {{that lead to the}} overestimates of the ultimate loads of composite columns and frames. This paper presents a nonlinear fiber element analysis method for predicting the ultimate strengths and behavior of short concrete-filled thin-walled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> with local buckling effects. The fiber element method considers nonlinear constitutive models for confined concrete and structural steel. Effective width formulas for steel plates with geometric imperfections and residual stresses are incorporated in the fiber element analysis program to account for local buckling effects. The progressive local and post-local buckling is simulated by gradually redistributing the normal stresses within the steel plates. Two performance indices are proposed for evaluating the section and ductility performance of concrete-filled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns.</b> The computational technique developed is used to investigate the effects of the width-to-thickness ratios and concrete compressive strengths on the ultimate strength and ductility of concrete-filled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns.</b> It is demonstrated that the nonlinear fiber element method developed predicts well the ultimate loads and behavior of concrete-filled thin-walled steel <b>box</b> <b>columns</b> and can be implemented into advanced analysis programs for the nonlinear analysis of composite frames...|$|R

40|$|The {{histories}} of corrosion {{loss of material}} have a big influence on the long-term mechanical performance of steel structures. Authors proposed a new FE analysis method that can {{take into account the}} {{histories of}} geometrical change in structures that is caused by the corrosion loss of material. By the use of this new method, it is expected that the change of residual stresses and residual deflections due to corrosion can be accurately evaluated at an arbitrary point of structural lifetime. Herein, in order to verify the validity of the proposed method, an experiment is carried out to measure the change of residual stresses by cutting a groove into a <b>box</b> <b>column</b> that mimics a local corrosion pattern. From this experiment, it is observed that the change of the residual stresses and residual deflections caused by the groove on the surface of a plate is well predicted by the proposed method if only the residual stresses and residual deflections of the virgin plate without the groove are known in advance. From a numerical example, it is shown that the strength and ductility of corroded compression plates may decrease to some extent due to the increase in the compressive residual stress caused by the corrosion loss of material...|$|E

This paper conducts a test and finite element analysis on the overall stability behaviour of welded Q 460 GJ steel <b>box</b> <b>columns.</b> In the test, four steel columns with different slenderness and width-to-thickness ratio were compressed under an axial compression testing machine. And finite element models were established in which material nonlinearity and residual stress distributions of test columns were included.

The <b>box</b> <b>column</b> is modelled as a symmetric three-layer composite structure with interlayer slips at the interfaces, based on the Engesser-Timoshenko theory with uniform shear deformation assumptions. Linear shear springs or slip modulus is considered at the interfaces to model the partial interaction between the sub-elements of the structure. The minimum total potential energy principle is utilized to obtain governing equations and boundary conditions. A direct analytical solution of the original governing equations is presented for obtaining exact buckling characteristic equation of the three-layer partial composite column with different end conditions including clamped-pinned end conditions. Also, the coupled equations are recast into an efficient uncoupled form and shown that there is a strong similarity with those for the two layer element. It is shown that the obtained formulae are converted to the known Euler column formulae when the slip modulus approaches infinity (i. e. perfect bonding) and no shear deformations in the sub-elements are considered. A differential shear Engesser-Timoshenko partial composite model is also employed and critical buckling loads, obtained from an inverse solution method, are compared to examine the validity and accuracy level of the uniform shear model. Comprehensive dimensionless numerical results are presented and discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
