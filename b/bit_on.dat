The following year (1962), RMIT bought a lithography press. King {{was one of the}} few able to use it. From then on King concentrated on producing lithographs and creative monotypes. In 1965, he acquired a small off-set litho press (12 ins x 15 ins or about 30.5 x 38.1cm) for his studio at Warrandyte. Although this press was “a <b>bit</b> <b>on</b> the small side”, by designing for its limitations King could make larger prints. Some years later, he acquired a larger press which “gave him scope to wield a longer, wider brush-mark on the lithographic plate”.|$|E
