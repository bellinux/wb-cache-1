40|$|Within {{two years}} of its {{transformation}} from a pilot project to an on-going savings programme for smallholders, the Cooperative <b>Savings</b> <b>Scheme's</b> balances increased from Sh 2 million to almost Sh 37 million, {{and the number of}} depositors exceeded 110, 000. By the close of 1974 these balances will no doubt exceed Sh 60 million, belonging to 150, 000 co-operators. Cooperative <b>Savings</b> <b>Scheme</b> balances have a considerable impact on cooperative finance and at the close of 1973 exceeded by Sh 22 million the amount of loans outstanding on the books of participating societies under the Cooperative Production Credit Scheme, a companion programme. The Cooperative <b>Savings</b> <b>Scheme</b> operates in rural areas only and most depositors are members of primary coffee marketing <b>societies.</b> The Cooperative <b>Savings</b> <b>Scheme</b> exhibits several operational and management problems and cannot yet be considered mature. However, its performance during a period of generally favourable conditions in the smallholder coffee sector suggests that considerable rural savings capacity exists among small cash crop farmers and that this capacity is not tapped by financial institutions other than cooperatives. Savings is defined simply as deferred consumption, and the financier's view of savings as a funds flow phenomenon is more relevant to rural development than are considerations of savings as an institutional phenomenon motivated by long run considerations...|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 2004 th year, the new {{strategy}} of <b>building</b> a <b>saving</b> <b>society</b> (SS) in China has attracted the main attention of experts and researchers from governments, universities and institutes. It is important, therefore, to model {{and evaluate the}} SS. Focusing on the designing of an indicator system, the paper aims to evaluate the saving states of China. Within the framework it has included five sub-systems of resources, economy, society, technology and environment, as well as 39 indicators. The method of entropy-value was used to decide the weights of every indicator. Moreover, two very important indexes, saving development index (SDI) and saving coordination index (SCI), were also set up to examine {{the development of the}} <b>saving</b> <b>society</b> in general and coordination situations of five sub-systems. Therefore, an empirical analysis on the historical evolution of China's <b>saving</b> <b>society</b> from 1990 to 2004 was carried out. It was argued that over the past 15 years there have been great changes in the <b>saving</b> <b>society</b> of China, but it mainly fell into the ranges of the modest saving development, whilst its five sub-systems keeping relatively least coordination. This implies {{that there will be a}} long way for China to realize its <b>saving</b> <b>society</b> in the future. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The mutual {{traditionally}} raises {{capital from}} its customer members {{in order to}} provide services to them (for example <b>building</b> <b>societies,</b> where members' <b>savings</b> enable the provision of mortgages to members). It redistributes some profits to its members. By contrast a joint stock company raises capital from its shareholders and other financial sources {{in order to provide}} services to its customers, with profits or assets distributed to equity or debt investors. In a mutual organization, therefore, the legal roles of customer and owner are united in one form ("members"), whereas in the joint stock company the roles are distinct. This allows a broader capital base if the customers cannot or will not provide sufficient financing to the organization. However, a joint stock company must also try to maximize the return for its owners instead of only maximizing the return and customer services to its customers. This can lead to a decline in customer service to the extent that customers', management's and shareholders' interests diverge.|$|R
5000|$|A {{savings and}} loan {{association}} (S&L), or thrift institution, is a financial institution that specializes in accepting savings, deposits, and making mortgage and other loans. The terms [...] "S&L" [...] or [...] "thrift" [...] are mainly used in the United States; similar institutions in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries include <b>building</b> <b>societies</b> and trustee <b>savings</b> banks. They are often mutually held (often called mutual savings banks), meaning that the depositors and borrowers are members with voting rights, and have the ability to direct the financial and managerial goals of the organization like the members of a credit union or the policyholders of a mutual insurance company. While it is possible for an S&L to be a joint-stock company, and even publicly traded; in such instances it is no longer truly a mutual association, and depositors and borrowers no longer have membership rights and managerial control. By law, thrifts can have no more than 20 percent of their lending in commercial loans — their focus on mortgage and consumer loans makes them particularly vulnerable to housing downturns such as the deep one the U.S. has experienced since 2007.|$|R
