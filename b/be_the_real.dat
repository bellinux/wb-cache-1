The celebration goes well until a strange man arrives, claiming to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> Seymour Skinner. Principal Skinner admits that he is an impostor, and that his real name is Armin Tamzarian. Armin then {{tells the story of the}} events that led him to steal Seymour Skinner's identity.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Combs {{appointed}} Clements {{as state}} highway commissioner. Some state newspapers charged that Clements had demanded this {{post at the}} head of the state's largest executive department in exchange for supporting Combs, a charge Combs denied. Others wondered if Clements took the post in order to organize the state political machinery for his friend Lyndon Johnson, who was rumored to be considering a run for president.

5|$|Manuel Alberti {{worked in}} journalism as well, at the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres {{newspaper}} {{created by the}} Junta. The ruling that created this newspaper gave Alberti the duty of selecting the news reports to publish. This duty was exclusive of Alberti and not shared with {{the other members of}} the Junta. Some historians also consider that Alberti may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> author of the newspaper's editorials, as they were not signed and the style is not similar to other reports by Mariano Moreno, who is usually considered the author.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern of}} the chronicle was the {{acquisition}} of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The Liber {{was used by the}} monks to defend their claims to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E

5|$|Samus {{returns to}} the {{research}} center, where she finds a body of James Pierce and a mummified remains of Ridley. She also discovers the survivor, and defeats a Queen Metroid. Samus pursues the survivor, who reveals herself to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> Madeline. Madeline explains that the woman Samus met earlier was MB, an android created to establish {{a relationship with the}} Metroids. Betrayed by scientists and Madeline, MB telepathically commanded the Space Pirate special forces to attack those on board. Samus and Madeline are confronted by MB; as a group of Federation troopers rushes into the room, MB summons the Bottle Ship's most dangerous creatures to attack everyone. Madeline stops MB, who is then destroyed by Federation troopers. The colonel compliments Samus's efforts but orders a trooper to escort Samus back to her ship; a trooper complies and reveals himself as Anthony, the only surviving member of the 07th Platoon. Samus, Madeline and Anthony leave for the Galactic Federation headquarters in Samus's gunship. Days after the incident, Samus {{returns to the}} Bottle Ship, now marked for destruction by the Galactic Federation, to retrieve something that is left there. After battling Phantoon, a monster Samus had also fought on Zebes, she arrives at the control center and recovers Adam's platoon helmet. The Bottle Ship's self-destruct sequence is remotely activated, which an armorless Samus escapes with Adam's helmet.|$|E
