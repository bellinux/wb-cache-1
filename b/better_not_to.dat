Even so, three key members of the MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.|$|E

After being informed, George informs Jerry he has no problem with him dating Marlene. The following night, Jerry asks Marlene to come to his apartment, but she tells him that it might be <b>better</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny, and that she could not date someone if she did not respect what they did.|$|E
5|$|When {{deciding}} on Charlotte staff, Toba {{thought it would}} be <b>better</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have exactly the same team that produced Angel Beats!. Having already decided to stick with Maeda, Na-Ga and P.A.Works, Toba aimed to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process, and in doing so would prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!. With that in mind, Toba wanted a director who had a good understanding of Angel Beats! and who would also be suitable as Charlotte director, leading him to seek out Yoshiyuki Asai. Toba took into consideration the storyboarding Asai had done for two episodes of Angel Beats!, and he thought that Charlotte would be a good opportunity to have a first-time series director. Asai was also chosen as someone who could handle both comedic and serious moments. When Horikawa first looked at Charlotte incomplete script, he told Maeda that it did not feel like it had the same kind of zeal that Angel Beats! had. However, once he saw the whole script, his concerns with it were dispelled, much to Maeda's relief.|$|E

25|$|Zeffirelli filmed his Romeo and Juliet {{shortly after}} {{completing}} {{work on his}} 1967 film The Taming of the Shrew, and had learned from his experience on that project that it was <b>better</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> include speeches made redundant by his vivid images. He played around 35% of Shakespeare's script, enhancing {{the focus on the}} two central characters and making them more sympathetic, while simplifying their roles to make them less tricky for his young leads to play. He tellingly juxtaposes the betrothal of Juliet and Paris with the Capulets' crumbling marriage. Yet the film is often noted for its zest for life and for love: the former epitomised by John McEnery's Mercutio, the latter by Leonard Whiting's Romeo. In contrast to Renato Castellani's 1954 version, Zeffirelli highlighted Romeo's positive relationships with the Friar, Balthazar and Mercutio. The way in which Mercutio physically collapses onto Romeo after the Queen Mab speech, and again when mortally wounded, has been credited with introducing homosexual overtones into the public perception of their relationship.|$|E
25|$|The {{judgment}} {{came just}} before full council elections were due in Lambeth, which had elections for every seat once every four years. If the councillors appealed and lost, {{they would be}} disqualified {{in the middle of}} the term, endangering Labour control of the council. The Lambeth Labour group decided (with seven dissenting) that it was <b>better</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> appeal, accept the disqualifications and select replacement candidates for the impending elections. After holding a special meeting to transfer running of the council up to the election to a special committee consisting of three Labour councillors who had not been surcharged (Janet Boston, and two had been elected in byelections after the rate was set), the councillors were disqualified on 30 March. The Transport and General Workers' Union ended financial support for the Liverpool and Lambeth councillors at the beginning of April, having spent £107,000 up to then. At the end of July 1986, the surcharged Lambeth councillors were given 21 months to pay off the surcharges; they were to pay £5,000 per month between them.|$|E

25|$|A general festival for all {{the provinces}} of Sweden is customarily held at Uppsala every nine years. Participation in this festival is {{required}} of everyone. Kings and their subjects, collectively and individually, send their gifts to Uppsala; - and – a thing more cruel than any punishment – those who have already adopted Christianity buy themselves off from these ceremonies. The sacrifice is as follows; of every kind of male creature, nine victims are offered. By the blood of these creatures it is the custom to appease the gods. Their bodies, moreover, are hanged in a grove which is adjacent to the temple. This grove is so sacred {{to the people that}} the separate trees in it are believed to be holy because of the death or putrefaction of the sacrificial victims. There even dogs and horses hang beside human beings. (A certain Christian {{told me that he had}} seen seventy-two of their bodies hanging up together.) The incantations, however, which are usually sung in the performance of a libation of this kind are numerous and disgraceful, and it is <b>better</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> speak of them.|$|E

500|$|Kings {{and priests}} in the Old Testament were {{forbidden}} to partake of wine at various times. John the Baptist was a Nazarite from birth. Nazarite vows excluded not only wine, but also vinegar, grapes, and raisins. (Jesus evidently did not take such a vow during the three years of ministry depicted in the gospels, but in fact was even accused by the Pharisees of eating and drinking with sinners. St. Paul further instructs Christians regarding their duty toward immature Christians: [...] "It is <b>better</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> eat meat or drink wine or {{to do anything else}} that will cause your brother to fall." [...] Jewish priests cannot bless a congregation after consuming alcohol.|$|E
500|$|Arensberg {{notes that}} Maya's rape is {{connected}} to the theme of death in Caged Bird, as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape {{was the first time he}} touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence. As Angelou later stated, [...] "I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was <b>better</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> talk".|$|E

500|$|Author Atara Stein {{wrote that}} the song [...] "suggests that love can operate only through a willful self-deception, a {{voluntary}} surrender to what one knows is an illusion. The singer begs his lover to 'wrap the night' around him because, as he proclaims, 'I don't want to see.' The singer knows that the image he creates of his loved one is false, {{but it is the}} only image that can satisfy him. He must perceive his beloved in idealized terms, so she can reflect back to him the image of himself that he desires to see." [...] Journalist Bill Graham believed the song was a bleak account of a failing romance. Hot Press editor Niall Stokes {{wrote that the}} song [...] "takes us back– again– to the shadowy world of deceit, infidelity, and betrayal. It depicts love at the end, the very end, of its tether. It is as bleak and as despairing a view of the world as you're likely to get, reflecting the emotional climate in which the entire album had been made." [...] He noted, [...] "In terms of its mood, 'Love Is Blindness' had the dark, sensual and decadent feel of pre-war Berlin", adding that the lyric [...] "Love is blindness / I don't want to see" [...] was [...] "a desolate acknowledgement of the terrible reality that it is sometimes <b>better</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know." ...|$|E
500|$|Benfica started December with a Derby de Lisboa {{game against}} Sporting. They won 3–0, with a first half goal by Van Hooijdonk and two {{goals in a}} five-minute span from João Tomás. Following the win, Mourinho {{requested}} a contract extension as a demonstration {{of faith in the}} work he had put in along with his assistant: [...] "Me [...] and Mozer thought {{that the only way to}} end speculation and the constant threat of being sacked in the event of a bad result...was renewing our contracts for another season." [...] Their proposal was not met. They parted ways with the club through an announcement in a press conference: [...] "He [...] thought it was <b>better</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> accept our request. We understood that decision showed a lack of trust in our work, and that we should offer our resignation..." [...] Benfica immediately appointed Toni – a long-time favourite of the President – as the new manager. On 10 December, Benfica played Alverca away from home. They opened the score sheet with a goal from João Tomás close to half-time, but Mantorras equalized. Later, Milinkovic put the Ribatejo side in the lead, resulting in the fourth loss in seven matches in away games for Benfica. In the last match of the year 2000, Benfica met a struggling Gil Vicente, who were at the bottom of the Primeira Liga standings. Unable to unlock the 0–0 draw, the club suffered their eighth winless league game of the season.|$|E
