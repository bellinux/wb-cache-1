5000|$|Mobile dry {{abrasive}} blast {{systems are}} typically {{powered by a}} diesel air compressor. The air compressor provides a large volume of high pressure air to a single or multiple [...] "blast pots". Blast pots are pressurized, tank-like containers, filled with abrasive material, used to allow an adjustable amount of blasting grit into the main <b>blasting</b> <b>line.</b> The number of blast pots is dictated by the volume of air the compressor can provide. Fully equipped blast systems are often found mounted on semi-tractor trailers, offering high mobility and easy transport from site to site.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the rocket net, other specialty equipment {{is necessary for the}} safe firing and storage of rocket nets and their charges. A blasting galvanometer, capacitor discharge machine, and electrical <b>blasting</b> <b>line</b> are recommended for the safe use of this equipment. In addition, an IME-22 container is necessary for the safe transportation of charges and an explosives magazine is required for long-term storage. Transportation and storage of the charges are regulated by the US Department of Transportation; Department of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and by other state and local agencies (ATF: Explosives Law and Regulations, ATF P 5400.7 and 29 CFR, Part 1910.109 and IME Safety Library Publication Numbers 1,3,12, 22, and 14).

50|$|The rocket net or similar-looking item {{is placed}} at the target {{location}} after days or week of pre-baiting the target species in, or is place {{in an area where}} it is likely to capture the target animals, to allow animals to become accustom to its presence. When the biologist is ready to use the actual rocket net, the net is folded accordion style in a line or packed in the rocket net bock. The rear or trailing edge of the net is staked to the ground by ropes and {{the leading edge of the}} net is attached to a number of rockets (typically 3 or 4) via longer ropes. The rockets are placed on the box, staked to the ground, or placed on post for additional elevation when taller animals are trapped. The charges are placed in the rocket and the wires attached to a shunted electrical <b>blasting</b> <b>line.</b> Once all the charges are connected, the line is tested, and the area is safe, it is attached to the capacitor blasting machine. When the animals are in place, the operator activates the blasting machine and the electrical charge ignites the rockets, propelling the net over the animals. The biologists and their team then remove the animals for whatever study they are conducting.|$|E

40|$|Blast is {{the most}} common biotic stress leading to the {{reduction}} of rice yield in many rice-growing areas of the world, including Malaysia. Improvement of blast resistance of rice varieties cultivated in blast endemic areas {{is one of the most}} important objectives of rice breeding programs. In this study, the marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB) strategy was applied to improve the blast resistance of the most popular Malaysian rice variety MR 219 by introgressing blast resistance genes from the Pongsu Seribu 2 variety. Two blast resistance genes, Pi-b and Pi-kh, were pyramided into MR 219. Foreground selection coupled with stringent phenotypic selection identified 15 plants homozygous for the Pi-b and Pi-kh genes, and background selection revealed more than 95 % genome recovery of MR 219 in advanced <b>blast</b> resistant <b>lines.</b> Phenotypic screening against blast disease indicated that advanced homozygous <b>blast</b> resistant <b>lines</b> were strongly resistant against pathotype P 7. 2 in the blast disease endemic areas.

40|$|One of {{the great}} {{classical}} problems in theoretical seismology is Garvin’s problem, which deals with the response of an elastic half-space subjected to a <b>blast</b> <b>line</b> source applied in its interior. However, Garvin (Exact transient solution of the buried line source problem. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series A 1956; 528 – 541 [4]) himself provided only the solution for points on the free surface of the half-space. Although a rigorous extension to points {{in the interior of}} the half-space was given nearly decade-and-a-half later by Alterman and Loewenthal (Algebraic expressions for the impulsive motion of an elastic half-space. Israel Journal of Technology 1969; 7 (6) : 495 – 504 [1]), these scientists published their paper in a technical journal of rather restricted circulation, as a result of which their complete solution remained largely unnoticed by the geophysical and soil dynamics communities.

40|$|AbstractSPA- 1 (signal-induced proliferation-associated gene- 1) is a {{principal}} Rap 1 GTPase-activating protein in hematopoietic progenitors. SPA- 1 -deficient mice developed a spectrum of myeloid disorders that resembled human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, CML in blast crisis, and myelodysplastic syndrome as well as anemia. Preleukemic SPA- 1 -deficient mice revealed selective expansion of marrow pluripotential hematopoietic progenitors, which showed abnormal Rap 1 GTP accumulation. Overexpression of an active form of Rap 1 promoted the proliferation of normal hematopoietic progenitors, while SPA- 1 overexpression markedly suppressed it. Furthermore, restoring SPA- 1 gene in a SPA- 1 -deficient leukemic <b>blast</b> cell <b>line</b> resulted in the dissolution of Rap 1 GTP accumulation and concomitant loss of the leukemogenicity in vivo.
