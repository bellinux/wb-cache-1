Since Charles II was dying at this time, Spain's cardinal electors were unsure {{of how they}} should vote, {{and they did not}} work closely with electors that were loyal to the Holy Roman Emperor. From the beginning, {{it was clear that the}} impending death of Charles II was likely to cause a lengthy conclave, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> pope would be expected to respond to the anticipated political crisis in Spain following Charles' imminent death.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans were {{apparently}} {{unaware of the}} 1st Battalion withdrawal, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> morning, July 25, two North Korean battalions in a double envelopment came in behind the positions 1st Battalion held the night before, but in front of Major Gordon E. Murch's 2nd Battalion. There the North Koreans {{were caught in the}} open by the combined fire of American tanks, artillery, and mortar, and the 2nd Battalion's automatic and small arms fire. The North Koreans suffered large numbers of casualties in this attack. Surviving remnants of the two North Koreans battalions withdrew in confusion. The 2nd Battalion took about 30 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|He became pope in 1534 {{when he was}} 66 years old, and {{immediately}} appointed {{members of his family}} to key positions. He anointed his eldest grandson Alessandro, the eldest child of his illegitimate son Pier Luigi, cardinal at the age of 14, marking a break with the Farnese tradition of marrying off the first-born to carry on the family name. This move was considered necessary <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> oldest grandson, Ottavio, was then just 10 years old; such a young cardinal would have been politically unacceptable. Paul's advanced years meant that the family could ill afford to wait until the younger brother was of age. Thus Alessandro became a cardinal deacon; this appointment did not necessitate taking major orders, but it compelled him to celibacy and to forgo the rights of primogeniture, which instead went to Ottavio. Alessandro was to bitterly regret the obligations. Paul appointed Ottavio as Duke of Camerino in 1538, and in the same year married him to Charles V's daughter, Margaret, later Margaret of Parma. Both of Paul's grandsons' advancements were widely criticised as evidence of nepotism.|$|E

5|$|Rochester's constable in 1264, Roger de Leybourne, {{held the}} castle {{in support of}} Henry. John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, was the garrison's co-commander. A baronial army led by Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford, laid siege to the castle on 17 April that year. Having marched from the earl's castle to Tonbridge the army {{attacked}} from the Rochester side of the river, either the south or west. While the army advanced towards the city the royalist garrison set alight the suburbs. The king's hall within the castle was also burned down, although it is unclear why. An army under Simon de Montfort marched from London {{with the intention of}} attacking the city from another direction. The earl's first two attempts to cross the Medway were fought back, but he was successful on 18April, Good Friday. The method used is uncertain, although it involved a fire-ship. The smoke may have been used as cover for the rebels, or the ship may have been used to burn the bridge while the army travelled by water. In a co-ordinated attack that had been pre-arranged, the armies of de Montfort and de Clare attacked the city. They entered Rochester in the evening and that night the cathedral was raided. The following day the rebels captured the castle's outer enclosure and the royal garrison retreated to the keep. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day was Easter Sunday there was no fighting, though hostilities resumed on the Monday. Siege engines were set up and targeted the keep. As in 1215 the keep proved resistant to missiles, and after a week had not succumbed. According to one contemporary source, the besiegers were about to dig a mine beneath the tower, but the siege was abandoned on 26April when the earls received news of a relief force led by HenryIII and his son, Prince Edward.|$|E

25|$|In March 1814, Berckheim took {{command of}} an 1,807-strong cavalry {{division}} {{consisting of two}} brigades under Jean Nicolas Curely and Pierre Mourier. Curely's brigade {{was made up of}} the 1st (406), 2nd (492) and 3rd (179) Provisional Regiments of Hussars, Chasseurs à Cheval and Lancers. Mourier's brigade included the 1st Provisional Regiment (501) of cuirassiers and carabineers and the 2nd Provisional Regiment (229) of dragoons. On 14 March, the new division arrived in the field with Napoleon's army. On 19 March Napoleon personally accompanied two French cavalry divisions from Plancy-l'Abbaye to Méry-sur-Seine. Evidently, these were the divisions of Berckheim and Louis-Michel Letort de Lorville <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day Letort was recalled to Arcis-sur-Aube with a pontoon bridge that had been captured. In a skirmish with Allied cavalry the following afternoon, Letort's division was driven back to Méry despite the assistance of Curely's brigade. That night, Letort set out again, leaving the pontoons with Berckheim. On 21 March, Berckheim's division joined the main army at Arcis. These actions were part of the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube. On 22 March, Berckheim's division accompanied Napoleon's army as it moved east, crossing the Marne River near Vitry-le-François.|$|E

500|$|When {{radio station}} KEDA-AM {{broke the news}} of Selena's death, many people accused the staff of lying <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day was April Fools' Day. In San Antonio, major Spanish-language radio {{stations}} including Tejano 107, KXTN-FM, KRIO-FM and KEDA-AM, began monitoring developments. All major U.S. networks interrupted their regular programming to break the news. The lead item on national television network evening news programs in Corpus Christi had {{been the end of}} the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike; within thirty minutes of its announcement, Selena's murder was the lead item on all television stations in South Texas. Her death was front-page news in The New York Times for two days, and was featured prominently on BBC World News. News of the singer's death reached Japan, where David Byrne first heard of the shooting. Univision and Telemundo were among the first national news stations to arrive at the crime scene. Carlos Lopez of KMIQ-105.1 told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times that [...] "Tejano music is dead for at least today" [...] and compared the reactions to Selena's death to reactions to the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and called March 31, 1995 [...] "Black Friday".

2500|$|If the {{defending}} team 'knocks on' or touches the ball when it's in the air, {{and the ball}} is immediately regathered by the attacking team, the referee may elect to restart the tackle count in lieu of awarding a scrum; known as the zero tackle rule <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> tackle is counted as 'tackle zero' and not the usual 'tackle one'. The zero tackle rule cannot {{be used in a}} set that was started by the zero tackle rule. On awarding the zero tackle rule, the referee will shout [...] "Back to zero!" [...] or [...] "Six again", and wave one arm over his head with fingers clenched into a fist, indicating the attacking side's next tackle is tackle zero. If a player collects the ball directly from an opposition kick in general play, the first time he is tackled does not register on the tackle count. If the receiving player kicks or passes the ball prior to being tackled then this does not apply.|$|E

2500|$|Livy’s {{narrative}} of the Third Samnite War ends here, {{with the end of}} Book 10. Books 11–20 have been lost. For Book 11 we only have a brief summary {{which is part of the}} Periochae, a summary of his 142 books (except for 136 and 137). There is mention of the consul Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges being defeated in Samnium and being spared a recall from the army and humiliation by the intervention of his father, Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, who promised to help him as deputy. The two men defeated the Samnites and captured Gaius Pontius, the Samnite commander, who was paraded in the triumph and beheaded. Gurges had moved against the Caudini and according to Eutropius his army was nearly destroyed and lost 3,000 men. Salmon thinks that this setback was probably an exaggeration <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year Gurges was appointed proconsul and he was consul again in 276 BC, during the Pyrrhic War.

2500|$|Georg {{was offered}} a {{position}} in the Kriegsmarine, but this occurred before the Anschluss. He was heavily recruited by the Nazis because he had extensive experience with submarines, and Germany was looking to expand its fleet of U-boats. With his family in desperate financial straits, and having no other marketable skills other than his training as a naval officer, he seriously considered the offer before deciding he could not serve a Nazi regime. Rather than threaten arrest, the Nazis actually continued to woo him. In the film, Georg is depicted initially as a humorless, emotionally distant father. In reality, third child Maria von Trapp (called [...] "Louisa" [...] in the film) described her father as a doting parent who made handmade gifts for the children in his woodshop and who would often lead family musicales on his violin. She has a different recollection of her stepmother, whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage.
