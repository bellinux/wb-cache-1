Nearing {{the end of}} the fourth quarter the Steelers were up by 8 points and the Lions were marching down the field. At this time the Lions mascot Roary The Lion, stepped on, <b>bit</b> <b>and</b> ripped apart a Terrible Towel. Following this the Lions {{suffered}} three straight sacks to put them in a long fourth and twenty-eight situation. The Lions did not convert and the Steelers won the game 28-20.|$|E

Here we use m-expressions more aggressively to further reduce the {{constants}} in our information-theoretic incompleteness theorems. Our main theorems are: 1) an N-bit formal axiomatic system cannot enable one to exhibit any specific object with program-size complexity greater than N+c, 2) an N-bit formal axiomatic system cannot enable one to determine more than N+c' scattered bits of the halting probability Omega. In chao-dyn/ 9407003, c = 2359 <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> c' = 7581 bits. In chao-dyn/ 9407005, c = 1127 <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> c' = 3689 bits.

I waited a <b>bit</b> <b>and</b> then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Hill {{learned of}} {{the remains of a}} Spanish saddle {{obtained}} from the George DeWitt farm in Webster County. He visited the farm, and learned from DeWitt, the son of the original homesteader, that when the land was first plowed, it was covered with Native American relics. Hill opened a grave and found a Spanish bridle <b>bit</b> <b>and</b> spur; across the river, on land that had never been plowed, he found traces of a camp, including rifle pits. The topography of the site closely matched Pike's description; and when Hill attempted to follow Pike's route from the site to the Arkansas River, he recognized a number of landmarks from Pike's account.|$|E
