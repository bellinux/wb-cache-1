2500|$|The {{physiological}} blood-flow response largely decides {{the temporal}} sensitivity, {{that is how}} accurately we can measure when neurons are active, in BOLD fMRI. The basic time resolution parameter (sampling time) is designated TR; the TR dictates how often a particular <b>brain</b> <b>slice</b> is excited and allowed to lose its magnetization. [...] TRs could vary from the very short (500ms) to the very long (3s). For fMRI specifically, the hemodynamic response lasts over 10 seconds, rising multiplicatively (that is, {{as a proportion of}} current value), peaking at 4 to 6 seconds, and then falling multiplicatively. Changes in the blood-flow system, the vascular system, integrate responses to neuronal activity over time. Because this response is a smooth continuous function, sampling with ever-faster TRs does not help; it just gives more points on the response curve obtainable by simple linear interpolation anyway. Experimental paradigms such as staggering when a stimulus is presented at various trials can improve temporal resolution, but reduces the number of effective data points obtained.|$|E

Methods: Brains of 5 -week-old Wistar rats were cut into slices which were 400 μm thick. These <b>brain</b> <b>slices</b> were randomly divided into blank control group, untreated group, low-dose ginsenoside Rg 1 group, medium-dose ginsenoside Rg 1 group and high-dose ginsenoside Rg 1 group, with 10 slices in each group. All <b>brain</b> <b>slices</b> were cultured with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). And <b>brain</b> <b>slices</b> in the ginsenoside R 1 groups were administered with ginsenoside Rg 1 (60, 120 and 240 μmol/L respectively) in ACSF for 2 h firstly. After 2 -hour culture, okadaic acid (OA) was administered into ACSF of the untreated group and the ginsenoside Rg 1 groups separately for 3 h to induce tau phosphorylation to prepare AD models. The concentration of OA in each group was 1 μmol/L. There was no any intervention for the <b>brain</b> <b>slices</b> in the blank control group. Expressions of P-tau, PP 2 A and tau proteins in the <b>brain</b> <b>slices</b> were determined by immunohistochemical method, {{and the results were}} analyzed by image acquisition and analysis system. Results: Compared with the blank control group, the expression of P-tau protein was significantly increased (P＜ 0. 01) and the expressions of tau and PP 2 A proteins were decreased (P＜ 0. 01, P＜ 0. 05) in the untreated group. Compared with the untreated group, the expression of P-tau was significantly decreased (P＜ 0. 01) and the expressions of tau and PP 2 A proteins were increased (P＜ 0. 01, P＜ 0. 05) in the ginsenoside Rg 1 groups, especially in the high-dose ginsenoside Rg 1 group.

Since then, using technology such as in-vivo electrophysiology/imaging and optogenetics, two in-vivo studies have reported the effect of GABA on neonatal brain, and both have shown that GABA is indeed overall inhibitory, with its activation in the developing rodent brain not resulting in network activation, and instead leading to a decrease of activity.|$|E

40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is {{the most}} {{significant}} infectious cause of congenital abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS) with variation from the fatal cytomegalic inclusion disease to functional brain disorder. The phenotype and degree of the brain disorder depends on infection time during the developing stage, virulence, route of infection and the viral susceptibility of the cells. The pathogenesis of the CMV infection to the CNS seems to be strongly related to neural migration, neural death, cellular compositions and the immune system of the brain. To understand the complex mechanism of this disorder, we used organotypic <b>brain</b> <b>slice</b> cultures. In the <b>brain</b> <b>slice</b> culture system, migration of CMV-infected neuronal cells was observed, which reflects infectious dynamics in vivo. Neural progenitor cells or glial immature cells in the subventricular zone and marginal area are most susceptible to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection in this system. The susceptibility declined as the number of immature glial cells decreased with age. The immature glial cells proliferated in <b>brain</b> <b>slice</b> cultures during prolonged incubation, and the susceptibility to MCMV infection also increased in association with the proliferation of these cells. The <b>brain</b> <b>slice</b> from an immunocompromised mouse (Beige-SCID mouse) unexpectedly showed lower susceptibility than that of an immunocompetent mouse during any prolonged incubation. These results suggest that the number of immature glial cells might determine the susceptibility of CMV infection to the brain, independent of the immune system.
