Seven flocks of indigenous goats were studied over a period of 15 months. Birth rates in the region approached 2. 1 kids per doe per year. A high total offtake of 28 percent and a weighted average death rate of about 16. 5 percent were observed. Mortality in kids was unrelated to number of births. Weighted average rate of gain for all surviving kids was 87 g per day to 3 months and 67 g per day to 6 months of age. The growth rates of twin and single kids were similar, but triplet kids grew at a slower rate. For each kilogramme liveweight of <b>breeding</b> <b>females,</b> <b>goats</b> produced 1. 5 and 8 times the weight of meat produced by sheep and cattle respectively under the same management and environmental conditions...|$|R

One was a medium size livestock oriented household residing in a high-quality grass and crop production zone {{on the border}} of the Republic of Mongolia, that had 20 cows, 100 <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>goats</b> and 400 <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> sheep. The other producer household, which resided in a very low-quality grass and crop production zone {{on the border of}} Jilin province was small size and communal grazing land based, with 9 cows and 25 adult <b>female</b> <b>goats.</b> The net cash and in-kind income, if only direct costs (essentially out-of-pocket or cash costs) are taken into account, was 14. 5 Yuan per hour of family labor for the medium producer, and 3. 7 Yuan for the small producer. Addition of cost for family labor (using an opportunity cost method) resulted in net income falling slightly, to 12. 8 Yuan for the medium sized producer and 1. 2 Yuan per hour for the small household. 　本稿は，中国内モンゴル自治区北東地域にある 2 つの定住畜産農家により収集されたデータに基づき，その経営状況を比較分析したものである。 2 つの農家のうち 1 つは，高質な草地と農地を有する，モンゴル共和国と隣接する国境地域に居住してある中規模の畜産農家で，計 20 頭の雌牛， 100 頭の繁殖用母ヤギと 400 頭の繁殖用母ヒッジを所有している。もう 1 つは，低質な草地と農地を有する，吉林省と内モンゴル自治区と隣接する地域に居住してある小規模の畜産農家で，共同用の草地を利用して， 9 頭の雌牛と 25 頭成年母ヤギを飼養している。 2 つの畜産農家の純所得（現金収入と現物所得を含む）は，直接費用のみ（原則的に自己負担費あるいは現金支払経費）を計算すれば，中規模の畜産農家においては，家族労働力 1 人当たり時間当たりの所得は 14. 5 元で，小規模の畜産農家のそれはわずか 3. 7 元である。家族労働力の機会費用もコストに加算すれば，その 1 人当たり時間当たりの純所得は，中規模畜産農家では 12. 8 元で，小規模畜産農家では 1. 2 元で，やや減少する...|$|R

The animals were divided into two groups, based on its body weight, namely 10 to 14. 99 kg (BP 1) and 15 to 20 kg (BP 2) of body weight. The data consisted of purchasing price, slaughter weight, variable cost, dressing and non carcass percentages and the butcher’s gross margin.

40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} {{on the effect of}} forages energy level on production and reproduction performances of Kosta <b>female</b> <b>goat</b> was conducted in two phases. The first phase, was observing the growth of Kosta <b>female</b> <b>goat</b> starting from the weaning age of 4 months to first puberty at 7 months and then to mating at 9 months. The variables found at this stage were: daily weight gain, the rations consumed, and the puberty age of the herd. The second phase was observing Kosta <b>female</b> <b>goat</b> from mating until giving birth. The variables determined were: ration consumed, body weight gain, length of pregnancy, litter size, birth weight and weaning weight. The research was conducted in experimental methods by using 24 four months old Kosta <b>female</b> <b>goats</b> weighing 6 - 7 kg, and 3 ram aged at 3 - 4 years. The design of the experiment used was completely randomized design. The treatments were 3 levels of ration energy 53 % TDN (R), 61 % TDN (R) 1 2 and 69 % TDN (R), with relatively equal protein percentage of 12 % (isoprotein). Each treatment was 3 replicated 8 times. The rations were forage consisted of field grass, leaves of: waru (Hibiscus tiliaceum. L), lamtoro (Leucaena glauca), gamal (Gliricida septium), and jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophylla). Generally, result of this experiment indicated that: (1) the higher the dietary energy up to 61 % TDN in the ration, the higher the production performances of Kosta <b>female</b> <b>goats</b> in term of efficiency of ration usage, body weight gain, birth weight, and weaning weight; (2) the higher the dietary energy up to 61 % TDN in the ration, the higher the reproduction performances of Kosta <b>female</b> <b>goats</b> in term of age of puberty, length of pregnancy, and litter size...|$|R

Each goat received 250 grams of supplemental diet in addition to grazing. Results showed that, daily average dry matter and crude protein intake significantly (P 0. 05) irrespective of level of energy supplementation. Average daily live weight gain increased (P> 0. 05) in a linear fashion and the mean values were 37. 7, 44. 4 and 52. 9 g/d for low, medium and high energy supplemented diets respectively.
