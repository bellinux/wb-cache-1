5|$|On his deathbed, Hamilton {{asked the}} Episcopal Bishop of New York, <b>Benjamin</b> <b>Moore,</b> {{to give him}} holy communion. Moore {{initially}} declined to do so, on two grounds: that {{to participate in a}} duel was a mortal sin, and that Hamilton, although undoubtedly sincere in his faith, was {{not a member of the}} Episcopalian denomination. After leaving, Moore was persuaded to return that afternoon by the urgent pleas of Hamilton's friends, and upon receiving Hamilton's solemn assurance that he repented for his part in the duel, Moore gave him communion. Bishop Moore returned the next morning, stayed with Hamilton for several hours until his death, and conducted the funeral service at Trinity Church.|$|E

500|$|At 4:00am, the {{soldiers}} began to march towards Trenton. Along the way, several civilians joined as volunteers, and led as guides (see Captain John Mott) {{because of their}} knowledge of the terrain. After marching [...] through winding roads into the wind, they reached Bear Tavern, where they turned right. The ground was slippery, but it was level, making it easier for the horses and artillery. [...] They began to make better time. They soon reached Jacobs Creek, where, with difficulty, the Americans made it across. The two groups stayed together until they reached Birmingham, where they split apart. Soon after, they reached the house of <b>Benjamin</b> <b>Moore,</b> where the family offered food and drink to Washington. At this point, the first signs of daylight began to appear.

50|$|A second charge {{ordered by}} Capt. <b>Benjamin</b> D. <b>Moore</b> further {{separated}} the Americans, and the Californios met his dragoons with a counter-charge by lancers. The charge was quickly surrounded, and Capt. Moore was killed. Gillespie arrived within fifteen minutes with the artillery. Mules {{are reluctant to}} wheel, and the horse-mounted Californios outflanked the Americans and captured one of the unattended howitzers. Gillespie's men unlimbered the remaining howitzer â€” John Sutter's Russian-made bronze four-pounder. Gillespie used a sabre to fight off a vicious personal attack made {{by a group of}} lancers in revenge for his previous actions during his occupation of Los Angeles and the broken agreement to cease hostilities. He took a lance thrust just over the heart that pierced a lung. Either this action (traditional U.S. view) or the unusual degree of bloodshed (traditional Californio view), prompted Pico to withdraw.|$|R
