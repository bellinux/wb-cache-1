5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of <b>beveling</b> is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} not so much the exact date of domestication of the horse, moreover what are the Origin of the domesticated horse and what is its relationship with the Wild horse of prehistoric times. Background Since the process of domestication inherently takes many generations over a long period of time, and the spread of breed and husbandry techniques is also slow, it is not meaningful to give a single "date of domestication". There are claims for Horse Domestication as early as 4, 500 BC in Iberia and the Eurasian Steppe. The earliest undisputed evidence is chariot burials dating to from 200 BC from Krivoe Ozero. (Sintashta – Petrovka Culture) on the Ural Steppe. Here horses were found accompanied by artefacts in graves – artefacts we would associate with riding or traction. (Levine, 1999) Various different theories have been postulated as to best estimate the earliest date of domestication. Uerpuann (1990) investigated the domestication of the horse in the West and Middle Europe. He concluded that a decreasing size and an increase in Heterogenity are taken as proof of domestication. However Levine (2006) disputed that the anatomy of the Equines has remained the same. Furthermore the large wild herds of horses that existed during the late Pleistocene in Europe, Asia and North America also exhibited heterogeneity. (Kavor and Dovc, 2008). Another weak theory was that increased relative abundance of horses (and horse remains) could indicate domestication. On the otherhand it could merely explained by increased hunting. Tooth morphology alone was considered an important analytic method. Horse teeth remains were studied at 2 Eneolithic sites, Botai in Northern Kazakhstan and Dereivka in the Urkraine (Year 35000 - 3000 BC). <b>Bevelings</b> on the anterior part of the lower P 2 masticatory surface were found (Levine, 1999). However this does not clearly indicate horses were ridden at this time. In fact the horses can be ridden without bits and also the upper 2 nd premolar can cause abnormal occlusions on the lower 2 nd premolar tooth. Therefore teeth occlusions alone does not provide enough information...|$|R

5000|$|The cards of Revised {{like the}} cards of the {{preceding}} Unlimited Edition all had white borders, no expansion symbol, and the artist credit at the bottom left. However, the cards were far paler than their Unlimited counterparts, and the three-dimensional <b>beveling</b> of the cards was cropped out. This gave the cards an appearance that was widely criticized as [...] "washed out" [...] and even unprofessional. The <b>beveling</b> was returned in 4th Edition, and the colors were much more vibrant in that set. The large print run meant that Revised basic lands were so numerous and common that it was uncommon to find any other lands in decks until several years later.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Beveling</b> and {{chamfering}} (along {{with other}} profiles) {{are applied to}} thicker pieces of metal prior to welding, see Welding_joint#V-joints. The bevel provides a smooth clean edge to the plate or pipe and allows a weld of the correct shape (to prevent center-line cracking) to join the separate pieces of metal.|$|E
50|$|When a {{piece is}} beveled at both ends, {{such that the}} two {{attached}} pieces do not lie in the same plane, a three-dimensional structure is obtained. In that case, it is also necessary either to rotate the piece in its longitudinal axis, or, to tilt the saw blade before <b>beveling</b> the second end.|$|E

50|$|The {{ground floor}} served as silong - laid with {{concrete}} flooring. Glass jalousies, steel bars, and grill doors were also located. The termination of full-height adobe walls was adorned with round-edge cornice. The second floor, which catered residential uses before, was laid with wide wood planks. Wooden door panels, and sliding capiz shell windows and persianas (wooden louvers) were also located. Some decorative elements {{at the second}} floor includes wood <b>beveling,</b> ventanilla, capsule-shaped design in the center panels, diagonal lattice espejo (clerestory), and pilasters with moldings.|$|E
50|$|A miter joint (mitre in British English), {{sometimes}} shortened to miter, {{is a joint}} made by <b>beveling</b> each of {{two parts}} to be joined, usually at a 45° angle, to form a corner, usually a 90° angle. For woodworking, a disadvantage of a miter joint is its weakness, {{but it can be}} strengthened with a spline. There are two common variations of a splined miter joint, one where the spline is long and runs the length of the mating surfaces and another where the spline is perpendicular to the joined edges.|$|E

50|$|Grass of L. inebrians is {{harvested}} {{during the}} flowering period, <b>beveling</b> it with sickles, or by cutting it with shears at {{a height of}} about 5 cm from the ground. When harvesting L. inebrians - 1-2 fruiting plants are left untouched for every 5 sqm sq ft to ensure their renewal. For normal regrowth and replenishment of this species harvesting its raw materials on the same sites is allowed no {{more than once in}} 2-3 years. Drying the raw material is done in the shade for 5-6 days, stirring occasionally. Flowers and leaves are separated from stems by shaking it down. Harvested raw materials are stored in dry, ventilated areas.|$|E
50|$|Fizeau interferometers are {{commonly}} used for measuring {{the shape of an}} optical surface: Typically, a fabricated lens or mirror is compared to a reference piece having the desired shape. In Fig. 1, the Fizeau interferometer is shown as it might be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of <b>beveling</b> is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. A collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminates the two flats, and a beam splitter allows the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E
50|$|Die {{and punch}} shapes affect the force during the {{punching}} process. The punch force increases {{during the process}} as the entire thickness of the material is sheared at once. A beveled punch helps in the shearing of thicker materials by reducing the force {{at the beginning of}} the stroke. However, <b>beveling</b> a punch will disort the shape because of lateral forces that develop. Compound dies allow multiple shaping to occur. Using compound dies will generally slow down the process and are typically more expensive than other dies. Progressive dies may be used in high production operations. Different punching operations and dies may be used at different stages of the operation on the same machine.|$|E
50|$|The Ripper was {{designed}} by Bill Lawrence, and manufactured from 1973 until 1983, the peak year being 1976. Most had a maple body with laminated maple neck; however a significant number manufactured in 1975 had lighter alder bodies while retaining the maple neck. Also in 1975, an edgier and slimmer body, with more <b>beveling</b> and contours around the horns of the bass, was introduced. The new look was geared towards heavier music that was gaining popularity under the ending decade.The later models of 1976 and on featured a different routing in the body for the wires, and the pickups were screwed in by three posts {{as opposed to the}} old two-post variation.|$|E
50|$|The most {{well-known}} and oldest forge-welding {{process is the}} manual-hammering method. Manual hammering is done by heating the metal to the proper temperature, coating with flux, overlapping the weld surfaces, and then striking the joint repeatedly with a hand-held hammer. The weld surfaces are usually formed for the proper joint, and then struck with a hammer to join them. The joint is often formed to allow space for the flux to flow out, by <b>beveling</b> or rounding the surfaces slightly, and hammered in a successively outward fashion to squeeze the flux out. The hammer blows are typically not as hard as those used for shaping, preventing the flux from being blasted out of the joint at the first blow.|$|E
5000|$|Reliability of the AR-7 {{is highly}} {{dependent}} {{on the condition of}} the magazine and on the ammunition used, perhaps more so than with other models of semi-automatic [...]22 caliber rifles. The feed ramp is part of the magazine and subject to damage from mishandling. Flat-nosed bullets tend to jam {{on the edge of the}} chamber of the barrel. The transition of cartridge from magazine to barrel can be smoothed by minor <b>beveling</b> of the chamber of the barrel, by using round-nosed as opposed to flat-nosed bullets and by paying attention to condition of the feed lips and feed ramp of the magazine. Later production magazines include an external wire spring to align the cartridge; earlier magazines used two pinch marks at the top of the magazine body, which in use could become sprung open or worn.|$|E
5000|$|An {{avalanche}} photodiode (APD) {{is a highly}} sensitive semiconductor electronic device that exploits the photoelectric effect to convert light to electricity. APDs {{can be thought of}} as photodetectors that provide a built-in first stage of gain through avalanche multiplication. From a functional standpoint, they can be regarded as the semiconductor analog to photomultipliers. By applying a high reverse bias voltage (typically 100-200 V in silicon), APDs show an internal current gain effect (around 100) due to impact ionization (avalanche effect). However, some silicon APDs employ alternative doping and <b>beveling</b> techniques compared to traditional APDs that allow greater voltage to be applied (> 1500 V) before breakdown is reached and hence a greater operating gain (> 1000). In general, the higher the reverse voltage, the higher the gain. Among the various expressions for the APD multiplication factor (M), an instructive expression is given by the formula ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{rangefinder}} {{system was}} also simplified {{from that of}} the M3 and this made it potentially more prone to rangefinder flare. The M2 has a rangefinder with a 0.72 magnification and framelines for 35, 50 and 90mm lenses instead of the 0.91 magnification and 50, 90 and 135mm framelines of the M3. This made it better suited for photojournalists who favour shorter lenses or for spectacle-wearers using a 50mm lens who sometimes find it difficult to see the framelines on the M3. The ground glass frameline illumination window of the M3 was replaced with a fresnel-type plastic lens. Finally, the ornate <b>beveling</b> around the various windows {{on the front of the}} M3 were flattened on the body of the M2. Unlike the M3, the widest framelines were not always visible so only one set of framelines were ever displayed at one time. All M2s are single stroke advance.|$|E

50|$|Zby {{was first}} {{described}} and named by Octávio Mateus, Philip D. Mannion and Paul Upchurch in 2014 {{and the type}} species is Zby atlanticus. It is known solely from its holotype, a closely associated partial skeleton including a complete tooth with root, a fragment of cervical neural arch, an anterior chevron, and an almost complete right pectoral girdle and forelimb. Zby is differentiated from other sauropods based on four autapomorphies, including a prominent posteriorly projecting ridge on the humerus {{at the level of}} the deltopectoral crest. Zby is suggested to be closely related to Turiasaurus riodevensis from approximately contemporaneous deposits in eastern Spain, based on its tooth morphology, extreme anteroposterior compression of the proximal end of the radius, and strong <b>beveling</b> of the lateral half of the distal end of the radius, while some other forelimb traits distinguish these two genera. Nearly all other anatomical features suggest that Zby is a non-neosauropod eusauropod, confirming its position as a Turiasaurian.|$|E
5000|$|The shop under Leonard created proteges {{who went}} on to become rod making greats in their own rite. Such names as: Hiram Hawes, F.E. Thomas, E.W. Edwards, E.F. Payne, Fred Devine and George I. Varney all worked for Leonard. In 1875 H.L. Leonard {{patented}} the water-proof ferrule, and Leonard rods became among the first to be made on a commercial beveler. It was while working with employee Loman Hawes, that they first developed the [...] "revolutionary" [...] beveler. It allowed Leonard to dramatically increase production as well as increase the quality and consistency of his product. Before this time, fly rods varied greatly rod to rod. Manufacturing was difficult due to the imprecision of the tools available. With his new beveler, Leonard was able to hold tolerances to thousands of an inch. The series of measurements, known as 'tapers', he used as the templates for <b>beveling</b> his rods became standards for every rodmaker thereafter.|$|E
50|$|Differential {{hardening}} is {{a method}} used in heat treating swords and knives to increase the hardness of the edge without making the whole blade brittle. To achieve this, the edge is cooled faster than the spine by adding a heat insulator to the spine before quenching. Clay or another material is used for insulation. To prevent cracking and loss of surface carbon, quenching is usually performed before <b>beveling,</b> shaping, and sharpening the edge. It can also be achieved by carefully pouring water (perhaps already heated) onto {{the edge of a}} blade {{as is the case with}} the manufacture of some kukri. Differential hardening technology originated in China and later spread to Korea and Japan. This technique is mainly used in the Chinese jian and the katana, the traditional Japanese sword, and the khukuri, the traditional Nepalese knife. Most blades made with this technique have visible temper lines. This method is sometimes called differential tempering, but this term more accurately refers to a different technique, which originated with the broadswords of Europe.|$|E
50|$|The way {{upon which}} the train ran {{consisted}} of a single iron girder 4 feet in depth for each span, placed over the center line of the posts. The girder carried an upper track beam and a lower track beam, upon the sides of each of which the rails, four in number, were placed. The two bearing rails, which carried the load of the train, consisted of angle irons placed upon the outer upper edge of wooden stringers upon the lower track beam. These stringers {{were placed in the}} exterior recesses formed by two channel bars properly secured to the sides of the posts. These rails were fastened to each other, to the stringers, and to the track beam by bolts passing clear through. Two vertically placed rails for the balancing or friction wheels were carried by the upper track beam. The distance from out to out between the lower rails was 22½ inches, this being sufficient to insure the necessary transverse stiffness. This was the gauge of the road. The distance between the upper rails was 17½ inches. It was expected to adopt the common form of rail, <b>beveling</b> the edges of the lower stringers and placing the rail at an angle of about 45 degrees. The rails were {{in the form of a}} right angle, and the treads of the wheels were made with a corresponding right angle groove. The usual length of post, 24 feet, would give a clear headway of 14 feet, 4 feet being taken up by the truss and 6 feet forming the foundation.|$|E
