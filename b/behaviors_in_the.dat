Characters and <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movie are based on Fey's high school life at Upper Darby High School and on the non-fiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes by Rosalind Wiseman. The cast includes other past cast members of SNL including Tim Meadows, Ana Gasteyer, and Amy Poehler. The film received favorable reviews, and was a box office success, grossing US$129million worldwide.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} antisocial and prosocial behavior of N = 439 adolescent athletes between 14 and 17 {{years of age}} (67 teams). Multilevel analyses showed that team membership explained 20 % and 13 % of <b>the</b> variance <b>in</b> antisocial and prosocial <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sports context, respectively. The team effects suggest that aggregating antisocial or prosocial adolescents within teams may partially explain differences in antisocial and prosocial <b>behavior</b> among athletes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sports context. A trend was found towards a relation between higher levels of moral reasoning within teams and less antisocial <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sports context. Favorable moral atmosphere was positively associated with more prosocial <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sports context. Finally, supportive coach-athlete relationships were associated with both less antisocial and more prosocial <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sports context...|$|R

Weakly fused participants were far less likely to undergo these procedures.|$|E
25|$|First, {{there is}} an extreme {{bottleneck}} in viral diversity {{at the time of}} sexual transmission. Second, transmission tends to occur early in infection before immune selection has had a chance to operate. Finally, the replicative fitness of a viral strain (measured in transmissions per host) is largely extrinsic to virological factors, depending more heavily on <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> host population. These include heterogeneous sexual and drug-use behaviors.|$|E
25|$|People {{are more}} likely to {{cooperate}} on a task if they can communicate with one another first. This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population. Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group.|$|E

Even if environment does play a role, the numbers would still be skewed.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Edward Carr {{published}} {{a paper on}} potential hypotheses for the occurrence and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors. This paper laid out the initial groundwork for a functional analysis of aberrant <b>behaviors.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> paper, Carr described five potential causes for self-injurious behaviors that included (1) positive social reinforcement contingent on the response, (2) negative reinforcement {{in the form of}} removal of an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, (3) the response produced stimuli possessed reinforcing qualities (automatic reinforcement), (4) the behavior was a byproduct of an underlying psychological condition, and (5) psychodynamic hypothesis in which the behavior was an attempt to reduce guilt. Throughout the paper, Carr cited recent research to support the first three hypotheses, and disprove the latter two hypotheses, but no formal experiment was conducted to determine the controlling variables of the problem behavior.|$|E
25|$|Stress {{has been}} known to cause both {{physiological}} and behavioral chronic issues for captive species including, but not limited to, altered reproductive cycling and behavior, reduced immune responses, disrupted hormone and growth levels, reduced body weight, heightened abnormal activities and aggression and decreased exploratory behavior with increased hiding behaviors. Such stress reactions could be caused by sounds, light conditions, odors, temperature and humidity conditions, material make-up of enclosures, habitat size constraints, lack of proper hiding areas, forced closeness to humans, routine husbandry and feeding conditions, or abnormal social groups to name a few. Use of both internal and external privacy screens on exhibit windows has been shown to alleviate stresses from visual effects of high crowd densities, leading to decreased stereotypic <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gorillas. Playing naturalistic auditory stimuli as opposed to classical music, rock music, or no auditory enrichment (which allows for crowd noise, machinery, etc. to be heard) has been noted to reduce stress behavior as well. Enrichment modifications to feed and foraging, where clover-hay is added to an exhibit floor, decrease stereotypic activities while simultaneously increasing positive food-related behaviors.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{universal}} <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> furry fandom {{is the creation of}} a fursona – an anthropomorphic animal representation or avatar. More than 95% of furries have a fursona – an anthropomorphic avatar or representation of themselves. Nearly half of furries report that they have only ever had one fursona to represent themselves; relatively few furries have had more than three or four fursonas; in part, {{this is due to the}} fact that, for many furries, their fursonas are a personally significant, meaningful representation of their ideal self. The most popular fursona species include wolves, foxes, dogs, large felines, and dragons. Data suggest that there are generally no associations between personality traits and different fursona species. However, furries, along with sport fans, report different degrees of personality traits when thinking of themselves in their everyday identity compared with their fan identity. Some furries identify as partly non-human: 35% say they do not feel 100% human (compared with 7% of non-furries), and 39% say they would be 0% human if they could (compared with 10% of non-furries).|$|E
25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members {{to identify with the}} positives and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs as part of the control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that {{there was no significant difference}} between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} used test {{batteries}} {{for the evaluation}} of affective <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> rodents.

2500|$|Intrinsic {{motivation}} {{has been}} studied since the early 1970s.
