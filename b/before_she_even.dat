25|$|Rocky Mountain bighorn rams employ {{at least}} three {{different}} courting strategies. The most common and successful is the tending strategy, in which a ram follows and defends an estrous ewe. Tending takes considerable strength and dominance, so ewes are more receptive to tending males, feeling {{they are the most}} fit. Another tactic is coursing, which is when rams fight for an already tended ewe. Ewes typically avoid coursing males, so the strategy is not effective. Rams also employ a blocking strategy. They prevent a ewe from accessing tending areas <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>even</b> goes into estrus.|$|E

It didn't take long for Blanco to begin living a life of crime.

Blanco had become a pickpocket <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>even</b> turned 13. To escape the sexual assaults from her mother's boyfriend, Blanco ran away from home at the age of 14 and resorted to looting in Medellín, Colombia until the age of 20.|$|E

The Queen persuaded the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, to vote Alice a dowry of £30,000 [...] (£ as of [...] ). Although the amount was considered generous at the time, Prince Albert remarked that [...] "she {{will not be able}} to do great things with it" [...] in the little realm of Hesse, compared to the riches that her sister Victoria would inherit as future Queen of Prussia and German Empress. Furthermore, the couple's future home in Darmstadt, the Grand Ducal seat, was uncertain. Although Queen Victoria expected that a new palace would be built, the people of Darmstadt did not want to meet that expense, and the resulting controversy caused resentment there. This meant that Alice was unpopular in Darmstadt <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>even</b> arrived.|$|E

[...] "Courtney was amazing", said Fleming. [...] "She was the most gung-ho person I've ever met. She {{was going to make}} the greatest record ever—I like that attitude in the studio. Courtney was like 'Let's go, fuckers', and I loved that." [...] In a later interview, Fleming said: Courtney was great at the time—it was <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>even</b> knew Kurt [...] She gave 180%. I've worked with some people that you've had to coax the performance out of them. With Courtney, there was no attitude. She was gonna give it all. And she did and it was really impressive to me... I loved the whole band; they were a lot of fun. That early lineup of Hole—I felt they were the real deal. They were Hollywood misfits—all of them. I felt it really captured what they were.|$|E
500|$|Conrad {{first met}} MacFarlane while {{recording}} a [...] clip {{for the season}} five episode [...] "Prick Up Your Ears". She had watched Family Guy for years and considered Stewie her favorite character. Conrad stuck to the script and did not do any improvisation while recording for this episode. In an interview with People, she revealed that she has no plans on getting into acting, and even calls herself an [...] "awful actor" [...] and admits that she cannot memorize lines. However, she enjoyed recording for this episode and hired an acting coach to help her get through the lines. Even though she enjoyed the experience, she said that [...] " [...] not really something I'm interested in." [...] She {{had to do a}} lot of research before recording, because [...] "there were a lot of facts and a lot of big words" [...] and she [...] "had to say it as if it was coming to [...] very easily." [...] Her acting coach advised her to learn the lines ahead of time so that she would [...] "really understood what [...] was talking about, it would come through a little more true." [...] MacFarlane commented on this, saying, [...] "She made an effort , so let me just put it that way." [...] He ultimately praised her performance, calling it [...] "surprisingly fantastic", and said: [...] "She came in, and she'd prepared <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>even</b> arrived. She hired an acting coach, with her own money, and she nailed it. She never once complained, and it was a long session. There was a lot of dialog. Her stamina was astonishing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{context of}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] {{and the fact}} that it occurs before Ariel meets and falls in love with Eric is often used to defend Ariel against critics who accuse her of sacrificing her talents for a man. Boing Boings Caroline Siede {{explained}} that Ariel [...] "just happens to end up with a prince in the process of achieving her larger dream" [...] to become human. Similarly, Sophie Katz of The Odyssey Online wrote that the song proves that Ariel [...] "doesn’t give up her voice only for a guy. She already wanted to be 'part of that world.' The prince was a bonus." [...] Writing for Yahoo! Movies, Gwynne Watkins penned [...] "There’s little doubt that Ariel’s crush on Prince Eric strengthens her resolve to be part of the human world. But crucially, her love of 'the world above' is established long before she sets eyes on the prince" [...] during [...] "Part of Your World". Laura Stampler, writing for Time, agreed that the character [...] " [...] in love with the human world <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>even</b> knew who Eric was" [...] because [...] "she has always dreamed of being a 'part of your world'". Ariel sings [...] "Bright young women, sick of swimmin’, ready to stand" [...] to indicate that she fantasizes about [...] "living in a feminist-friendly society where she can speak her mind freely and grow intellectually", demonstrating envy towards women who are capable of doing this on land. However, Times Laura Stampler joked that Ariel will find the human world disappointing [...] "considering my dad definitely still reprimanded me (even though I had legs)." [...] In the reprise, the lyrics [...] "Part of that world" [...] are replaced with [...] "part of your world" [...] to distinguish that the character is now referring to her feelings for Eric, whom Ariel had not yet met when she sang the original song.|$|E

[...] "To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends: no formal party." [...] It was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had provided herself, the [...] "Miss Elliot at home," [...] were laid on the table, with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth. The truth was, that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his. The past was nothing.

The elements were different, but the effect, like the other, arrested her on the threshold: she stood there stupefied and delighted at the magic of a passion of which such a picture represented the low-water mark. Wound up but sincere, and passing quickly from room to room, Fleda broke out <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>even</b> sat down. [...] "If you turn me out of the house for it, my dear, there isn't a woman in England for whom it wouldn't be a privilege to live here." [...] Mrs. Gereth was as honestly bewildered as she had of old been falsely calm. She looked about at the few sticks that, as she afterwards phrased it, she had gathered in, and then hard at her guest, as if to protect herself against a joke sufficiently cruel. The girl's heart gave a leap, for this stare was the sign of an opportunity. Mrs. Gereth was all unwitting; she didn't in the least know what she had done, and as Fleda could tell her Fleda suddenly became the one who knew most. That counted for the moment as a magnificent position; it almost made all the difference. Yet what contradicted it was the vivid presence of the artist's idea. [...] "Where on earth did you put your hand on such beautiful things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Anna Etherington was {{of course}} my {{constant}} companion during many long and delightful visits at the rectory. Three years my junior, the friendship on my part had commenced by a hundred acts of boyish kindness. Between the ages of seven and twelve, I dragged her about in a garden-chair, pushed her on the swing, and wiped her eyes and uttered words of friendly consolation when any transient cloud obscured the sunny brightness of her childhood. From twelve to fourteen, I told her stories; astonished her with narratives of my own exploits at Eton, and caused her serene blue eyes to open in admiration at the marvels of London. At fourteen, I began {{to pick up her}} pocket-handkerchief, hunt for her thimble, accompany her in duets, and to read poetry to her, as she occupied herself with the little lady-like employments of the needle. About the age of seventeen I began to compare cousin Anna, as I was permitted to call her, with the other young girls of my acquaintance, and the comparison was generally much in her favor. It was also about this time that, as my admiration grew more warm and manifest, she became less confiding and less frank; I perceived too that, for a novelty, she now had some secrets that she did not choose to communicate to me, that she was more with her governess, and less in my society than formerly, and on one occasion (bitterly did I feel the slight) she actually recounted to her father the amusing incidents of a little birthday fete at which she had been present, and which was given by a gentleman of the vicinity, <b>before</b> <b>she</b> <b>even</b> dropped a hint to me, touching the delight she had experienced on the occasion.
