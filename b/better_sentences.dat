The developed tool will allow a user to beautify an input sentence in terms of tuning it on different scales like valence, affect, prospect, and praise. For example using such a tool one may get the recommendations like, “Your lovely email makes me very glad”, or “I become glad to read your email”, or “I am very happy to obtain your nice email ” for the input sentence “I am happy to receive your email ” after scaling up the input sentence on affective, or prospective, or valence scale respectively.

It is hoped that this study can help Indonesian learners of English to be able to construct <b>better</b> <b>sentences</b> and also can assist teachers of English to have a broader knowledge on students? errors. The writer identifies the appropriate and the deviation use of finite verb based on tenses. Then from the deviation sentence, the writer identifies the types of grammatical error related to the use of finite verbs using linguistic category taxonomy proposed by Politzer and Ramirez (1973). This study applies descriptive qualitative approach. The writer calculates the frequency of finite verb occurred in each tense. The frequency of occurrence on each type of grammatical error are also calculated to reveal the type of grammatical error mostly occur in sentences with deviations. The result of the analysis shows that the finite verb mostly found {{is in the form of}} simple present tense. Most of the finite verb errors in the sentence also happen when students fail to apply the simple present tense. While the type of ?agreement of subject and verb? error is the type of error mostly found in the deviation sentence. It seems that the errors may happen because the students transfer the rules from Bahasa Indonesia into English...|$|E

Based on this, we use multi-level bootstrapping to improve the alignments between documents, sentences, and bilingual word pairs, iteratively. Our method is the first method that does not rely on any supervised training data, such as a sentence-aligned corpus, or temporal information, such as the publishing date of a news article. It is validated by experimental results that show a 23 % improvement over a method without multilevel bootstrapping. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{learning}} English, grammar {{is considered}} as {{the backbone of}} the language. By learning grammar, students learn how to make use of words so that they can comprehend better and construct <b>better</b> <b>sentences.</b> Without learning grammar, students will not have good comprehension and competence and thus, makes it impossible for students to master English well. Therefore, grammar is included in the curriculum of junior high school students in Indonesia. However, English teachers tend to teach grammar using traditional techniques, for instance Deductive Application of Rule. Using this technique, teachers dominate the interactions in the classroom and students have less interaction with other students. This can create boredom and students may lose their interest in learning grammar. This quasi experimental pre-test, post-test non-equivalent control group study investigated if Student Teams Achievement Division technique could help students achieve better grammar achievement, specifically in degrees of comparison. This study conducted in a private junior high school in Surabaya. Two techniques, Deductive Application of Rule and Student Teams Achievement Division, were applied to different classes in order to find out whether the null hypothesis which stated that there is {{no significant difference between the}} grammar achievement of students taught using STAD and those taught using Deductive Application or Rule should be accepted or not. The result of the study showed that both techniques significantly improved the students’ grammar achievement in their respective groups. Then, the writer analysed the gain score means from both group using T-test: two samples assuming unequal variances. The data analysis showed that the t-obtained was greater than t-critical (2. 826 > 2. 000).

To reduce the re-liance on labeled examples, we propose an unsupervised method to clean bilin-gual data. The method leverages the mu-tual reinforcement between the sentence pairs and the extracted phrase pairs, based on the observation that <b>better</b> <b>sentence</b> pairs often lead to better phrase extraction and vice versa. End-to-end experiments show that the proposed method substan-tially improves the performance in large-scale Chinese-to-English translation tasks. ...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a suite of techniques to trim and improve it. First, we validate a hypothesis that, given a current sentence, inferring the previous and inferring the next sentence provide similar supervision power, therefore only one decoder for predicting the next sentence is preserved in our trimmed skip-thought model. Second, we present a connection layer between encoder and decoder to help the model to generalize better on semantic relatedness tasks. Third, we found that a good word embedding initialization is also essential for learning <b>better</b> <b>sentence</b> representations. We train our model unsupervised on a large corpus with contiguous sentences, and then evaluate the trained model on 7 supervised tasks, which includes semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, and text classification benchmarks.

40|$|The {{increased}} attention to connectives {{has led to}} more {{evidence in support of}} their processing benefits for discourse understanding. As Murray(1997) reviewed, psychological experiments have shown that the presence of connectives between adjacent clauses reduces the reading time of the second clause (Haberlandt, 1982; Millis & Just, 1994), enhances memory for the clauses (Caron et al., 1988; but see Millis et al., 1993), increases accuracy in response to comprehension questions, and decreases question-answering time (Millis & Just, 1994). Despite the view that connectives facilitate comprehension, two issues still remain. First, what remains unclear is how different types of connectives impact processing. Research has presented an equivocal picture on this issue. For example, Caron et al. (1988) showed that memory for sentence pairs was improved when because was placed between the sentences, suggesting that causal connectives result in <b>better</b> <b>sentence</b> integration than do additive or adversative connectives. In contrast, Murray (1995) showed that adversative connectives were associated with better memory than were additive and causal connectives.

40|$|Saliency and {{coverage}} {{are two of}} the most important issues in document summarization. In most summarization methods, the saliency issue is usually of top priority. Many studies are conducted to develop <b>better</b> <b>sentence</b> ranking methods to identify the salient sentences for summarization. It is also well acknowledged that sentence selection strategies are very important, which mainly aim at reducing the redundancy among the selected sentences to enable them to cover more concepts. In this paper, we propose a novel sentence selection strategy that follows a progressive way to select the summary sentences. We intend to ensure the coverage of the summary first by an intuitive idea, i. e.; considering the uncovered concepts only when measuring the saliency of the sentences. Moreover, we consider the subsuming relationship between sentences to define a conditional saliency measure of the sentences instead of the general saliency measures used in most existing methods. Based on these ideas, a progressive sentence selection strategy is developed to discover the "novel and salient" sentences. Compared with traditional methods, the saliency {{and coverage}} issues are more integrated in the proposed method. Experimental studies conducted on the DUC data sets demonstrate the advantages of the progressive sentence selection strategy. Department of Computin...|$|R

L 2 writers were usually reported to have more difficulty setting goals and generating material, and to produce less accurate and effective texts (Leki, 1992; Silva 1993, 1997). This paper compares the self-reported writing difficulties of two groups: L 1 (N= 19) and L 2 (N= 19) freshman composition students from an American university. To analyze the group differences, a questionnaire (using 5 -point Likert scale) about the perceptions of writing difficulties and approaches to writing process was used.

40|$|This is a publisher’s {{version of}} an article {{published}} in Australian Journal of Audiology 1994. This version is reproduced with permission from the publisher, Australian Academic Press. [URL] choice of strategy in auditory-visual training remains a controversial topic. Bisensory training involves exposing the subject to both of the main sources of information (auditory-visual). Unisensory training, on the other hand, focuses individually on each of the main modalities of sensory input (auditory, visual). Proponents of the bisensory training view suggest that auditory-visual training is most appropriate since this is the dominant mode of interaction in conventional communication settings. Those advocating unisensory training, suggest focussing on each modality separately prevents interference from one sense inhibiting training of the other sense. A training study is presented where three groups of four normally hearing subjects were given thirty-six sessions of analytic training using discrimination recognition and repetition tasks. Subjects were allocated to one of three groups based on their score on the CNC word test at the first evaluation; bisensory training (BS), bisensory input with unisensory training (BSUT) and unisensory training (US). Auditory stimuli were filtered (300 Hz low-pass) and all stimuli were presented in the context of 50 dB of white noise. Evaluations were conducted at five points (two pre-training and two post-training) to measure improvement of five phoneme, word and sentence tasks. The evaluations were conducted in all of the modalities of interest (auditory-visual, auditory, visual). In general there were no group differences across the training tasks, although the US group showed greater improvement that the BSUT and BS groups on vowel perception. Results of a phonetic feature analysis of word level performance will be presented.

40|$|While {{published}} linguistic judgments sometimes {{differ from}} the judgments found in large-scale formal experiments with naive participants, {{there is not a}} consensus as to how often these errors occur nor as to how often formal experiments should be used in syntax and semantics research. In this article, we first present the results of a large-scale replication of the Sprouse et al. 2013 study on 100 English contrasts randomly sampled from Linguistic Inquiry 2001 – 2010 and tested in both a forced-choice experiment and an acceptability rating experiment. Like Sprouse, Schütze, and Almeida, we find that the effect sizes of published linguistic acceptability judgments are not uniformly large or consistent but rather form a continuum from very large effects to small or nonexistent effects. We then use this data as a prior in a Bayesian framework to propose a small n acceptability paradigm for linguistic acceptability judgments (SNAP Judgments). This proposal makes it easier and cheaper to obtain meaningful quantitative data in syntax and semantics research. Specifically, for a contrast of linguistic interest for which a researcher is confident that <b>sentence</b> A is <b>better</b> than <b>sentence</b> B, we recommend that the researcher should obtain judgments from at least five unique participants, using at least five unique sentences of each type. If all participants in the sample agree that <b>sentence</b> A is <b>better</b> than <b>sentence</b> B, then the researcher can be confident that the result of a full forced-choice experiment would likely be 75 % or more agreement in favor of sentence A (with a mean of 93 %).

Pre- and post-test measures included sentence recognition for both trained and untrained talkers in quiet and in speech babble noise, as well as emotion recognition for novel talkers. One group of normal-hearing subjects listened to an 8 -channel CI simulation in their right ear, whereas another group additionally listened to 500 -Hz low-pass filtered speech in the left ear, simulating a CI combined with a hearing aid (HA) in the contralateral ear (CI+HA). The CI+HA group showed more improvement in talker identification accuracy with training than the CI group, even when the 500 Hz low-pass speech was replaced by an F 0 -controlled sine wave. However, F 0 cues alone only partially accounted for the benefits. For both groups, sentence recognition for trained and untrained talkers improved with training, both in quiet and in noise. Compared to the CI group, the CI+HA group showed <b>better</b> <b>sentence</b> recognition before and after training, but their improvements in quiet were smaller compared to the CI group, likely due to ceiling effects. However, in noise both groups showed similar improvements. These improvements were retained in both groups a month post-training. The CI+HA group performed significantly better than the CI group on the emotion recognition task before and after training and overall post-test performance was significantly better than pre-test performance. These results suggest that training may improve talker identification for CI users with or without access to low-frequency acoustic hearing. However, training was more effective with access to low-frequency acoustic hearing, in terms of improvement in talker identification and generalization to both speech and emotion recognition. These findings have significant clinical implications for CI users in real-world listening situations. Further studies are needed to verify these findings in adult CI users and bimodal listeners. ...|$|R

Four metrics for matching sentences required for measuring the alignment at the sentence level are compared: the standard sentence length ratio (SLR), and three new metrics, absolute sentence length difference (SLD), compression code length ratio (CR), and absolute compression code length difference (CD). Initial experiments with CR show that using the Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM) compression scheme, a method that also performs well at many language modeling tasks, significantly outperforms the other standard compression algorithms Gzip and Bzip 2.
