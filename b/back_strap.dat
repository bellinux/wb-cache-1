25|$|Textile {{production}} in Michoacan includes embroidery, <b>back</b> <b>strap</b> and foot-pedal loom weaving, and crochet. Weaving {{dates back to}} the pre Hispanic period, when cotton, ixtle and even feathers and rabbit were used to create cloth and other textiles. All weaving was done on <b>back</b> <b>strap</b> looms, and the relatively narrow cloth stitched together when wider pieces were need to items such as huipils and blankets. The Spanish brought sheep and wool was added alongside the native fibers. They also introduced the framed pedal loom, which allows the creation of wider, thicker and longer pieces. The arrival of the Spanish also introduced new designs, such as horses appearing in weavings. Textile work is still passed on from generation to generation in indigenous communities in the state and is an important source of income for these families.|$|E
25|$|To this day, {{the most}} {{traditional}} huipils {{are made with}} hand woven cloth on a <b>back</b> <b>strap</b> loom. However, the introduction of commercial fabric made this costly and many indigenous women stopped making this fabric, or making simpler versions. By the early 1800s, women began to wear undecorated huipils or European style blouses. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, most Maya women had forgotten the technique of brocade weaving entirely.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{communities}} are noted for weaving. El Jorongo {{is one of}} these, for items made both on <b>back</b> <b>strap</b> and pedal looms. <b>Back</b> <b>strap</b> and pedal looms {{are used in the}} Nahua coastal areas and the Mazahua mountain areas of the state for both everyday and festive wear. The finest woven products of both wool and cotton are made in Patzcuaro, Uruapan and Zamora, producing rebozos, other traditional clothing, and linens. Wool items are woven on backstrap looms is only done in the Purepecha region and part of the Mazahua region {{in the eastern part of}} the state. Angahuan is noted for its rebozos, blankets, echequemos, ruanas and heavy fabrics with images of birds, flowers and geometric patterns. Heavy jackets are made in Pichátaro, Santa Clara del Cobre, Cherán, Comachúen, Macho de Agua, Nahuatzen, Sevina and Charapan. In Tarecuato, backstrap looms create wool belts and in Cuanajo, they make pouches, belts and more in a “dog leg” pattern. In Boca de la Cañada, Crescencio Morales and Macho de Agua, rebozos, cobijas, jackets, carrying bags and more are created with fabric made on backstrap looms, with elements such as stars, fretwork and deer.|$|E

25|$|Many people regard visible tan {{lines as}} un-aesthetic, {{and seek to}} avoid tan lines that will be visible when regular clothes are worn. Some people try to achieve an all-over tan or to {{maximize}} their tan coverage. To achieve an all-over tan, tanners need to minimize the amount of clothing they wear while tanning. For women who cannot dispense with a swimsuit, they at times tan with the <b>back</b> <b>strap</b> undone while lying on the front, or removing shoulder straps, besides wearing swimsuits which cover less area than their normal clothing. Any exposure is subject to local community standards and personal choice. Some people tan {{in the privacy of}} their backyard where they can at times tan without clothes, and some countries have set aside clothing-optional swimming areas (popularly known as nude beaches), where people can tan and swim clothes-free. Some people tan topless, and others wear very brief swimwear, such as a microkini or thong.|$|E
2500|$|A mid-life {{upgrade to}} the Glock pistols {{involved}} {{the addition of}} checkering on the front strap and serrations to the <b>back</b> <b>strap.</b> These versions, introduced in 1988, were informally referred to as [...] "second-generation" [...] models. To meet American ATF regulations, a steel plate with a stamped serial number was embedded into the receiver {{in front of the}} trigger guard.|$|E
2500|$|The crupper {{consists}} of a loop (the crupper itself) and an adjustable strap (crupper strap or <b>back</b> <b>strap)</b> that connects the crupper to back of a riding saddle or {{the other parts of}} a harness. [...] The strap runs from the horse's dock, over the croup, to the saddle or to the back band (sometimes called the saddle) of a harness.|$|E

2500|$|In Michoacán, women weave on <b>back</b> <b>strap</b> looms as {{they did}} in the pre-Hispanic period with most weaving on pedal looms done by men. Sheep are {{generally}} shorn twice a year, spring and fall, with the wool obtained in each season requiring different handling because of the types of impurities found. Most wool is white but brown and black is found as well. Wool textile products include sarapes, wrap belts, rebozos, rugs and blankets. Cotton is spun and woven mostly to create clothing and linens—including dresses, shirts, blouses, jackets, tablecloths, table runners, napkins, and bedspreads. The most representative work in cotton comes from Patzcuaro and Uruapan, as well as Zacán and Tócuaro. [...] Other notable cotton work is that of the Nahuas in the coastal areas. These textiles tend to be the most traditional, as they are made for self-consumption, with the pieces created from the growing of the cotton to weaving the cloth to sewing and embroidering the garment. The two towns best known for this work are Cachán and Maruata.|$|E
2500|$|The {{other type}} of {{external}} frame which recently was proposed, is made from composite plastic which is not flexible like current backpack straps and also {{it is a kind}} of material that can be shaped like human spine curvature. In this type of backpack, load directly transfers to the shoulders through the non-flexible straps. This non-flexible structure diminishes the momentum at lumbar region of the <b>back.</b> <b>Strap</b> curvature is shaped close to spine curvature and there are two flexible drawstrings to prevent backpack movement in transverse plane. The straps of this backpack are wide enough to distribute the pressure on shoulders and also a white glass wool layer is added to the internal part of them to absorb dynamic forces, which could be produced through walking. This backpack type is an experimental sample that need further options to be prepared for [...] usage. One of the benefits of backpack with external frame is preventing the spine to incline forward during walking that would be helpful in preventing damage of long term backpack carrying.|$|E

50|$|Bags {{used to keep}} pizza hot {{while being}} transported are {{commonly}} referred to as hotbags or hot bags. Hotbags are thermal bags, typically made of vinyl, nylon, or Cordura, that passively retain heat. Material choice affects cost, durability, and condensation. Heated bags supply added heat through insertion of externally heated disks, electrical heating elements, or pellets heated by induction from electrically generated magnetic waves. Innovations in delivery bag designs have allowed without the usage of a fixed box for bike delivery, such as a hard frame, <b>back</b> <b>straps,</b> and waterproofing. These systems proved to be cheaper, more efficient and faster to use.|$|R

50|$|In 2005, Smith & Wesson debuted a new polymer-frame pistol {{intended}} for the law enforcement market. Dubbed the M&P (for Military and Police), its name was meant to evoke S&W's history as the firearm of choice for law enforcement agencies through its previous lineup of M&P revolvers. The M&P is a completely new design with no parts interchangeable with any other pistol including the Sigma. The new design not only looks completely different than the Sigma but feels completely different with 3 different <b>back</b> <b>straps</b> supplied with each M&P. Many of the ergonomic study elements that had been incorporated into the Sigma and the SW99 were brought over to the M&P. The improved trigger weight and feel, and unique takedown method (not requiring a dry pull of the trigger) were meant to set the M&P apart from both the Sigma and the popular Glock pistols.|$|R
