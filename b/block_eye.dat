40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} whether simultaneous or successive presentation of stimuli {{is related to the}} duration of eye fi xation (i. e., the time spent gazing a specifi c stimulus), this study described the eye movements of young adults in simultaneous and successive simple discrimination tasks. Using 12 landscape scenes as visual stimuli, three participants were exposed to a simple discrimination training with simultaneously presented stimuli (Si Procedure) and then to a second simple discrimination training with successively presented stimuli (Su Procedure). Another three participants were exposed to the Procedure in the opposite order. In both cases, the learning criterion was that at least 90 % of the responses should be correct in one <b>block.</b> <b>Eye</b> movements were recorded during the whole experiment. Participants achieved the learning criteria in both procedures. Beyond that, eye fi xation time in the Su Procedure was higher than in the Si Procedure, regardless of the training sequence. Taken together with previous results in different experiments, our fi ndings suggest that the duration of eye fi xation plays {{a central role in the}} establishment of different stimulus control topographies...|$|E
40|$|To {{distinguish}} the frequently misdiagnosed plateau iris <b>eyes</b> from pupillary <b>block</b> group and normal group, {{we compared the}} ocular biometrical parameters of them by A-scan ultrasongraphy. In total, we retrospectively reviewed general characteristics and ocular findings including ocular biometric measurements of 71 normal, 39 plateau iris, and 83 pupillary <b>block</b> <b>eyes.</b> The normal controls, plateau iris group and pupillary block group were significantly different in age, but not in gender. The anterior chamber depth tended to decrease and the lens thickness tended to increase from normal to plateau iris to pupillary <b>block</b> <b>eyes.</b> Compared to those of plateau iris group, the pupillary block group had significantly shallower anterior chamber depth (2. 90 mm vs. 2. 33 mm; p< 0. 001), thicker lens (4. 77 mm vs. 5. 11 mm; p< 0. 001), shorter axial length (23. 16 mm vs. 22. 63 mm; p< 0. 001), smaller relative lens position (2. 28 vs. 2. 16; p< 0. 001) and larger lens/axial length factor (2. 06 vs. 2. 26; p< 0. 001). However, when comparing plateau iris and normal eyes, only axial length and lens/axial length factor were significantly different (23. 16 vs. 23. 54; p< 0. 05 and 2. 06 vs. 1. 96; p< 0. 05). Measured by A-scan ultrasonography, the ocular biometrics of plateau iris were significantly {{different from those of}} pupillary <b>block</b> <b>eyes.</b> However, our A-scan ultrasongraphy generally found no significant biometric differences between plateau iris and normal eyes. These findings suggest that while A-scan ultrasonography might be used as a practical tool for differentiating plateau iris and papillary <b>block</b> <b>eyes,</b> a more meticulous gonioscopy and other assessments may be necessary to distinguish plateau iris from normal eyes...|$|R

40|$|Scorpions {{are largely}} solitary, nocturnal arachnids that glow a bright cyan-green under UV light. The {{function}} of this fluorescence is a mystery. Previous studies of four species from three families {{have shown that}} scorpion lateral and medial eyes are maximally sensitive to green light (around 500 nm) and secondarily to UV (350 - 400 nm). Scorpions are negatively phototactic, and we used this behaviour to assay the responses of desert grassland scorpions, Paruroctonus utahensis, to 395 nm UV light, 505 nm cyan-green light, 565 nm green light and no light within small, circular arenas. Based on the eye sensitivity data, we predicted maximal response to 505 nm, followed by lower responses to 395 and 565 nm. In our experiments, however, scorpions responded most intensely (abrupt bouts of locomotory activity) to 395 nm and 505 nm. Next, we ran trials under 395 and 505 nm on scorpions with their <b>eyes</b> <b>blocked.</b> Scorpions with <b>blocked</b> <b>eyes</b> were {{much less likely to}} move under 505 nm than under 395 nm and were much less likely to move under 505 nm than were control animals (those without their <b>eyes</b> <b>blocked).</b> These results suggest an active role for fluorescence in scorpion light detection. Other studies indicate that photosensitive elements in scorpion tails are sensitive to green light. We therefore propose that the cuticle may function as a whole-body photon collector, transducing UV light to cyan-green before relaying this information to the central nervous system. Scorpions may use this information to detect shelter, as blocking any part of the cuticle could diminish the signa...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFollowing moving visual stimuli (conditioning stimuli, CS), many organisms perceive, in {{the absence}} of {{physical}} stimuli, illusory motion in the opposite direction. This phenomenon is known as the motion aftereffect (MAE). Here, we use MAE as a tool to study the neuronal basis of visual motion perception in zebrafish larvae. Using zebrafish eye movements as an indicator of visual motion perception, we find that larvae perceive MAE. <b>Blocking</b> <b>eye</b> movements using optogenetics during CS presentation did not affect MAE, but tectal ablation significantly weakened it. Using two-photon calcium imaging of behaving GCaMP 3 larvae, we find post-stimulation sustained rhythmic activity among direction-selective tectal neurons associated with the perception of MAE. In addition, tectal neurons tuned to the CS direction habituated, but neurons in the retina did not. Finally, a model based on competition between direction-selective neurons reproduced MAE, suggesting a neuronal circuit capable of generating perception of visual motion...|$|R

40|$|Howard D Palte Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative Medicine and Pain Management, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA Abstract: In {{the past}} decade {{ophthalmic}} anesthesia has witnessed a major transformation. The sun has set on the landscape of ophthalmic procedures performed under general anesthesia at in-hospital settings. In its place a new dawn has ushered in the panorama of eye surgeries conducted under regional and topical anesthesia at specialty eye care centers. The impact of the burgeoning geriatric population is that {{an increasing number of}} elderly patients will present for eye surgery. In order to accommodate increased patient volumes and simultaneously satisfy administrative initiatives directed at economic frugality, administrators will seek assistance from anesthesia providers in adopting measures that enhance operating room efficiency. The performance of <b>eye</b> <b>blocks</b> in a holding suite meets many of these objectives. Unfortunately, most practicing anesthesiologists resist performing ophthalmic regional blocks because they lack formal training. In future, anesthesiologists will need to <b>block</b> <b>eyes</b> and manage common medical conditions because economic pressures will eliminate routine preoperative testing. This review addresses a variety of topical issues in ophthalmic anesthesia with special emphasis on cannula and needle-based blocks and the new-generation antithrombotic agents. In a constantly evolving arena, the sub-Tenon’s block has gained popularity while the deep angulated intraconal (retrobulbar) block has been largely superseded by the shallower extraconal (peribulbar) approach. Improvements in surgical technique have also impacted anesthetic practice. For example, phacoemulsification techniques facilitate the conduct of cataract surgery under topical anesthesia, and suture-free vitrectomy ports may cause venous air embolism during air/fluid exchange. Hyaluronidase is a useful adjuvant because it promotes local anesthetic diffusion and hastens block onset time but it is allergenic. Ultrasound-guided <b>eye</b> <b>blocks</b> afford real-time visualization of needle position and local anesthetic spread. An advantage of sonic guidance is that it may eliminate the hazard of globe perforation by identifying abnormal anatomy, such as staphyloma.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that to make a goal-directed reach to grasp movement, precise visual information of target and hand is important. In spite of various studies relating to visual feedback in reach to grasp, few researchers have investigated the parameters of this behavior in relation to saccadic eye movement. Specifically, research in this area lacks insight about the contribution of visual feedback before and after the occurrence of saccadic eye movement. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the influence of eye movement on the characteristics of the hand movement during a reach to grasp task. In this experiment, 9 college-age individuals performed the task of reaching and grasping a vertical dowel in two conditions: (1) with eye movement and (2) without eye movement (by fixating eye on central dowel). Further, we compared the performance in three sub-conditions: (1) full vision, (2) vision <b>block</b> before <b>eye</b> movement, and (3) vision <b>block</b> after <b>eye</b> movement. We found that presence or absence of either eye movement or continuous vision of target and hand does not modify the accuracy of grasp. Reach duration was shorter with full vision and reach trajectory was shorter when eye movement was coordinated with hand movement. We concluded that continuous vision of the hand and target is not necessary for the online control of these complex movements, but vision is necessary for optimizing the speed of the movement...|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{putative}} free {{fatty acid}} (FFA) transduction mechanisms {{have been identified in}} the oral cavity. They reportedly differ in their distribution on the tongue and each has a unique range of ligand specificities. This suggests that there should be regional differences in sensory responses to varying FFAs. This was assessed through spatial testing with caproic (C), lauric (L), and stearic (S) FFAs among 35 healthy adults. Stimuli were applied to the fungiform (FU), foliate (FO), and circumvallate (CV) papillae with a cotton-tipped applicator. Oral detection thresholds were measured by an ascending, 3 -alternative, forced-choice, sip and spit procedure. Intensity ratings were obtained on the general labeled magnitude scale. Nongustatory cues were minimized by testing with the nares <b>blocked,</b> <b>eyes</b> covered, and by masking tactile cues with the addition of gum acacia and mineral oil to the stimuli vehicle. Thresholds were obtained from nearly all individuals at each site, and the concentration was similar across the 3 FFAs. Absolute intensity ratings differed significantly with C > L > S overall and at the CV and FO papillae. At the FU papillae, the L and S ratings were comparable. Ratings were highest at the FU followed by the CV and then the FO papillae. Slopes of the concentration–intensity rating functions were higher for L compared with C and S at the CV papillae as well as both L and C compared with S at the FO papillae. However, overall, slopes were comparable across sites. These findings strengthen evidence for oral FFA perception in humans by replicating threshold sensitivity findings and documenting monotonic scaling ability for these stimuli. Further, they challenge current views on transduction as sensory responsiveness was observed at tongue sites not predicted to support FFA detection...|$|R
