40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{nonlinear}} and adaptive <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> control of linear induction motors. Specifically, we present an exact model knowledge controller that ensures exponentially tracking of a time-varying velocity profile and an adaptive controller that ensures velocity tracking error signal converges to zero asymptotically.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} repetitive and iterative {{learning control}} design and analysis for <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> controlled nonlinear systems. To precisely track periodic or finite duration trajectories for nonlinear systems, <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> control is first designed to render closed loop stability and, in theory, asymptotic tracking performance. However, {{due to the}} sensitivity to the unmodelled dynamics plant variations, asymptotic tracking performance is usually not feasible. Thus, repetitive or learning control is applied over the <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> controlled system to restore asymptotic tracking performance. This approach is applied to an electrohydraulic material testing system, in which the material specimen present substantial nonlinear force and displacement relationship. It will be shown that the <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> control employs both feedback and feedforward actions to render linearized I/O plant and thus the outer loop repetitive and learning control design can {{be based on the}} compensated linear system. Experimental results will be given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{position}} {{control of a}} linear induction motor using adaptive fuzzy <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> design with integral action is proposed. First, the indirect field oriented control for LIM is derived. Then, an integral <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> design for indirect field oriented control of LIM is proposed to compensate the uncertainties which occur in the control. Finally, the fuzzy integral-back stepping controller is investigated, where a simple fuzzy inference mechanism is used to achieve a position tracking objective under the mechanical parameters uncertainties. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by numerical simulation. The numerical validation results of the proposed scheme have presented good performances compared to the conventional integral <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> control...|$|R

40|$|Processive {{stepping}} of myosin Va (myoV) {{has been}} tracked by monitoring either the tail position (center of mass) or {{the position of}} one or both heads. Here, we combine these two approaches by attaching a quantum dot {{to one of the}} motor domains and a bead to the tail. Using laser trapping and total internal reflection microscopy, the position of one head and the tail are observed simultaneously as myoV moves processively on an actin filament bundle against the resistive load of the laser trap. The head moves one step (73 ± 10 nm) for every two steps of the tail (35 ± 9 nm). One tail step occurs concurrently with quantum dot-labeled head movement, whereas the other occurs with movement of the unlabeled head, consistent with a hand-over-hand model. Load increases the probability of the motor taking a <b>back</b> <b>step.</b> The <b>back</b> <b>step</b> is triggered by the motor taking a shorter forward step (head step, 68 ± 11 nm; tail step, 32 ± 10 nm), likely one actin monomer short of its preferred binding site. During a <b>back</b> <b>step,</b> the motor reverses its hand-over-hand motion, with the leading head detaching and reattaching to one of multiple actin sites behind the trailing head. After a <b>back</b> <b>step,</b> the motor can correct its mistake and step processively forward at resistive loads < 0. 7 piconewton or stall or detach at higher loads. <b>Back</b> <b>stepping</b> may provide a mechanism to ensure efficient cargo delivery even when myoV encounters obstacles within the actin cytoskeletal meshwork or when other motors are attached to the same cargo...|$|R
