2500|$|In an {{initially}} unrelated development, three Bar-class boom defence vessels {{were ordered}} by the RAN in 1937. When the requirement was lowered to two ships in early 1938, the third, , was earmarked for construction as a prototype of the 'local defence vessel'. McNeil completed his drawings in February 1939; his design was for a 680-ton vessel, with a speed of , {{and a range of}} [...] The prototype would have been armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations. Although closer to a small sloop than a local defence vessel, the increase in size and speed meant the design was more versatile than originally envisioned. Before construction could begin, the number of boom vessels was increased back to three, and Kangaroo was laid down as a <b>boom</b> <b>defence</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) {{identified}} {{the need for}} a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of [...] The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class <b>boom</b> <b>defence</b> <b>vessel</b> saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a [...] top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to be fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype [...] did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the [...] "Australian Minesweepers" [...] (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as [...] "corvettes") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed {{during the course of the}} war: 36 (including Mildura) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.|$|E
2500|$|The boom {{ran from}} the East Beach at Shoeburyness, Essex to Royal Oak Point in Sheerness, Kent a {{distance}} of some 5.6 miles (9.0 km). [...] In the shallow water at either end, closest to the land, the boom was formed of wooden piles driven into the sandy seabed and reinforced with concrete â€“ on the Essex side of the boom these extended over 1 mile (1.6 km) into the estuary. [...] Where the boom met the deep water channel it transitioned into an anti-submarine net. [...] At intervals along the net 200-ton lighters were stationed armed with anti-aircraft guns and searchlights. [...] Two gates was included within the net to allow for access by shipping, one towards the north {{for access to the}} Thames and one towards the south for the River Medway ports. [...] These were opened by a Royal Navy <b>boom</b> <b>defence</b> <b>vessel</b> and closed overnight. [...] The boom was backed up by the nearby Maunsell Sea Forts and by a coastal battery at Shoeburyness. [...] The latter housed two 6" [...] naval guns and search-light emplacements protected by landward defences. [...] A second boom was placed across the Thames at Canvey Island and similar protections were installed at the Solent (to protect the naval port of Southampton) and at Plymouth. [...] The remains of the coastal artillery emplacement at Shoeburyness, together with its magazines and search-light emplacements are also visible but lie within the grounds of MoD Shoeburyness with no public access. [...] There are no visible remains of the boom at the Shoebury end but a line of piles and wrecked boats is visible at the Sheerness end at Minster Beach.|$|E

The last four vessels were ordered separately and are sometimes known as the Gadfly class, although they were essentially identical.
