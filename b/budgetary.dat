5|$|The Parliament is also {{responsible}} for discharging the implementation of previous budgets based on the annual report of the European Court of Auditors. It has refused to approve the budget only twice, in 1984 and in 1998. On the latter occasion {{it led to the}} resignation of the Santer Commission; highlighting how the <b>budgetary</b> power gives Parliament a great deal of power over the Commission. Parliament also makes extensive use of its <b>budgetary,</b> and other powers, elsewhere; for example in the setting up of the European External Action Service, Parliament has a de facto veto over its design as it has to approve the <b>budgetary</b> and staff changes.|$|E
5|$|After {{the episode}} was submitted, several re-writes were requested. Originally, {{the story was}} {{supposed}} to take place in Oklahoma, noted for being the center of Tornado Alley. For <b>budgetary</b> reasons, the episode was relocated to Mississippi. Another scene, originally scripted to take place at a motel, featured Pinker taking a short cut through a wall. This scene was cut not only because of <b>budgetary</b> reasons, but also because the writers and producers wanted to shift the episode from a supernatural focus to an emotional one.|$|E
5|$|<b>Budgetary</b> {{restraints}} in the 1990s {{forced the}} provincial government to sell off or download many highways to lower levels of government, or, {{in the case of}} Highway407, to a private consortium.|$|E
5|$|Economic and Financial Affairs (Ecofin): Composed of {{economics}} and finance ministers of the member states. It includes <b>budgetary</b> and eurozone matters via an informal group composed only of eurozone member ministers.|$|E
5|$|Königsberg and {{her sisters}} were {{designed}} to serve both as fleet scouts in home waters and in Germany's colonial empire. This {{was a result of}} <b>budgetary</b> constraints that prevented the Kaiserliche Marine from building more specialized cruisers suitable for both roles.|$|E
5|$|Similar <b>budgetary</b> {{difficulties}} {{were being}} faced by other nations with space station projects, prompting American {{government officials to}} start negotiations with partners in Europe, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative, multi-national, space station project.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU {{member states}} to adopt the euro upon meeting certain {{monetary}} and <b>budgetary</b> convergence criteria, although not all states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions, while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and <b>budgetary</b> requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislative}} branch officially holds the Union's <b>budgetary</b> authority with powers gained through the <b>Budgetary</b> Treaties of the 1970s and the Lisbon Treaty. The EU budget {{is subject to}} a form of the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (before 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. If the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively.|$|E
5|$|The {{standardisation}} greatly simplified {{the manufacture}} of equipment, the supply of materials and the <b>budgetary</b> and financial control of the construction {{as well as the}} speed of planning for construction projects.|$|E
5|$|This {{contract}} {{was completed in}} 1993, after which <b>budgetary</b> restraints prevented the awarding of further contracts. As a result, aside from the interchange at Highway417 and some overpasses, construction activity on Highway416 came to a standstill for two years.|$|E
5|$|When the General Assembly {{votes on}} {{important}} questions, {{a two-thirds majority}} of those present and voting is required. Examples of important questions include recommendations on peace and security; election of members to organs; admission, suspension, and expulsion of members; and <b>budgetary</b> matters. All other questions are decided by a majority vote. Each member country has one vote. Apart from approval of <b>budgetary</b> matters, resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters {{within the scope of}} the UN, except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council.|$|E
5|$|Written by Peter Grimwade, this two-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 13 August 1984 and abandoned due to <b>budgetary</b> concerns on 8 November 1984 {{after the completion}} of a scene breakdown. Nothing exists of this story.|$|E
5|$|<b>Budgetary</b> reasons caused Licence to Kill to be {{the first}} Bond film shot {{completely}} outside the United Kingdom, with locations in both Florida and Mexico. The film earned over $156 million worldwide, and enjoyed a generally positive critical reception, with ample praise for the stunts, but attracted some criticism of Dalton's dark and violent interpretation of Bond {{and the fact that the}} film was significantly darker and more violent than its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|He {{worked for}} five years at the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, as a budget officer, then became a senior {{specialist}} for <b>budgetary</b> and fiscal policy at the Library of Congress. His final position, from 1976 to 1979, was {{on the staff of}} U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012, 20th Century Fox stopped {{production}} before filming could begin. <b>Budgetary</b> issues remained unresolved and Sutherland's narrow {{time frame}} for filming were cited as reasons for halting production. However, in July 2012, Sutherland assured {{the film was}} still in plans {{and that they would}} begin filming in summer 2013. The film was eventually suspended in May 2013 after the announcement that the show would return as a limited series.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>budgetary</b> problems, the senior Italian navy commanders could not agree on {{the shape of the}} post-war Regia Marina. One faction advocated a traditional surface battle fleet, while a second believed a fleet composed of aircraft carriers, torpedo boats, and submarines would be ideal. A third faction, led by Admiral Sechi, argued that a balanced fleet with a core of battleships and carriers was the most flexible option. In order to secure <b>budgetary</b> space for new construction, Sechi drastically reduced the number of older ships in service; he also cancelled the battleships of the Francesco Caracciolo class. Francesco Caracciolo was sold on 25 October 1920 to the Navigazione Generale Italiana shipping company. The firm planned to convert her into a merchant ship, but the work was deemed too expensive, and so she was temporarily mothballed in Baia Bay outside Naples.|$|E
5|$|Kagame's {{relations}} with the US and UK have come under strain in the early 2010s, following allegations that Rwanda is supporting the M23 rebel movement in Eastern Congo. The UK suspended its <b>budgetary</b> aid programme in 2012, freezing a £21million donation. The US has also frozen some of its military aid programme for Rwanda, although it stopped short of suspending aid altogether.|$|E
5|$|Marostica, {{regarded}} as a moderate Republican, focused heavily on fiscal issues as a legislator, including transparency and loosening <b>budgetary</b> restrictions, {{and sat on the}} legislature's Joint Budget Committee during the 2009 session. In July 2009, Marostica resigned from the legislature to accept the post of economic development director in the cabinet of Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter, where he has focused on attracting and growing business in the state of Colorado during the ongoing recession.|$|E
5|$|QuestWorld {{characters}} were created as wire frame models, augmented with faces scanned from clay busts, then digitally painted and inked. Animation company Buzz F/X, based in Montreal and Santa Monica, created first season sequences. Work began in April 1996 {{with the opening}} titles—a gliding journey through a canyon of green, cartographic lines with scenes illuminated upon the walls. Buzz F/X used mostly inexperienced animators, as <b>budgetary</b> constraints would not permit hiring seasoned employees.|$|E
5|$|The Teaneck Public Schools had a <b>Budgetary</b> Per Pupil Cost of $18,417 in its 2012–13 budget, 26.8% {{higher than}} the average of $14,519 budgeted that year by districts in the same {{grouping}} of grades and enrollment, ranked as the 101st highest among the 106 K-12 districts in the state with more than 3,500 students.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Flammen's death was challenged by Danish National Archives's Peter Birkelund. In the film Flammen commits suicide {{in the basement}} of his house after the Gestapo find him, presumably because of Ketty's betrayal. Birkelund, however, says Flammen was killed on a coastal road while the Gestapo was looking for another resistance member. In contrast, the filming of Citron's death, which would require 250 soldiers, was consciously altered by Madsen for <b>budgetary</b> reasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the live action footage was deleted; because Bakshi {{wanted to keep the}} breakdancing sequences, he used rotoscoping to animate the footage, but did not animate all of the movements for <b>budgetary</b> reasons. Little dialogue from the 1974 cut of the film was retained in the animated version, which instead featured newly recorded dialogue by Proval, Romanus, and Philip Michael Thomas, who had starred in Coonskin.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} theatrical {{release date}} {{was due in}} November 2004 before being changed many times; the dates had been moved to February 2005, 29 July, 23 November, and finally 26 August. Executive producer Bob Weinstein blamed the pushed back release dates on <b>budgetary</b> concerns. To help promote The Brothers Grimm, a three-minute film trailer was shown at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, while twenty minutes of footage was shown at the 2005 event.|$|E
5|$|The {{project that}} {{eventually}} led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful Pegasus engine to dramatically improve the capabilities of the Harrier. Due to <b>budgetary</b> constraints, the UK abandoned the project in 1975.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and <b>budgetary</b> pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the four}} {{graduates}} the Air Force had enrolled in 1927, <b>budgetary</b> constraints imposed during the Great Depression necessitated the transfer from Duntroon to Point Cook of eight other RAAF-sponsored cadets midway through their four-year course, including Alister Murdoch, Bill Garing and Douglas Candy. Initially ranked pilot officer, Hely commenced his flying training course at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, on 15January 1931, graduating on 10December. His early postings as a pilot in 1932 and 1933 were to RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria. Qualifying in aerial photography, he served at Point Cook from 1933 to 1936. He was then transferred to No.3 Squadron at Richmond, receiving promotion to flight lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Between 1978 and 1980, the DoD and USN {{repeatedly}} {{attempted to}} terminate the AV-8B program. There had previously been conflict between the USMC and USN over <b>budgetary</b> issues. At the time, the USN wanted to procure A-18s for its ground attack force and, to cut costs, pressured the USMC to adopt the similarly-designed F-18 fighter instead of the AV-8B to fulfill the role of close air support (both designs were eventually amalgamated to create the multirole F/A-18 Hornet). Despite these bureaucratic obstacles, in 1981, the DoD included the Harrier II in its annual budget and five-year defense plan. The USN declined {{to participate in the}} procurement, citing the limited range and payload compared with conventional aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>budgetary</b> constraints, the {{production}} {{was not able}} to shoot the remounted scenes of episode one in the north-east, and they instead had to be filmed in and around Watford. Beach-set scenes were shot at Folkestone rather than Whitley Bay, which was obvious to locals on screen due to the presence of pebbles on the beach, which are not present at Whitley. This led to some critics mockingly referring to {{the production}} as Our Friends in the South.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} {{the site was}} open on the first Saturday in April and October. Admission is free. There is a display on the Schmidt family in the house during each open house. In 2014, the White Sands Missile Range {{announced}} that due to <b>budgetary</b> constraints, the site would only be open once a year, on the first Saturday in April. In 2015, this decision was reversed, and two events were scheduled, in April and October.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, by 1795, {{the army}} had already made itself odious, by both rumor and action, {{throughout}} France through its dependence upon the countryside of material support and its general lawlessness and undisciplined behavior. After April 1796, the military was paid in metallic value, not the worthless paper, but pay was still well in arrears. The French Directory believed that war should pay for itself and did not budget to pay, feed, and equip its troops. Thus, a campaign that would take the army out of France became increasingly urgent for both <b>budgetary</b> and internal security reasons.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the {{legislative}} branch officially holds the Union's <b>budgetary</b> authority. The EU's budget (which is around 155 billion euro) is subject {{to a form of}} the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (prior to 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. But if the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively. In addition to the budget, the Council coordinates the economic policy of members.|$|E
5|$|He had {{restored}} American {{credit and}} assumed state debt; created a bank, a mint, a coast guard, a customs service, and a diplomatic corps; introduced the first accounting, tax, and <b>budgetary</b> procedures; maintained peace {{at home and}} abroad; inaugurated a navy, bolstered the army, and shored up coastal defenses and infrastructure; proved that the country could regulate commerce and negotiate binding treaties; protected frontier settlers, subdued Indian uprisings, and established law and order amid rebellion, scrupulously adhering all the while to {{the letter of the}} Constitution... Most of all he had shown a disbelieving world that republican government could prosper without being spineless or disorderly or reverting to authoritarian rule.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, BART stated its {{intention}} to improve non-peak (night and weekend) headways for each line to 15 minutes. The current 20-minute headways at these times is a barrier to ridership. In mid-2007, BART temporarily reversed its position stating that the shortened wait times would likely not happen due to a $900,000 state revenue budget shortfall. Nevertheless, BART eventually confirmed {{the implementation of the}} plan by January 2008. Continued <b>budgetary</b> problems halted the expanded non-peak service and returned off-peak headways to 20 minutes in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, NASA held a {{symposium}} on project costs which presented {{an estimate of}} the Apollo program costs in 2005 dollars as roughly $170 billion. This included all research and development costs; the procurement of 15 Saturn V rockets, 16 Command/Service Modules, 12 Lunar Modules, plus program support and management costs; construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading, and costs for flight operations. This was based on a Congressional Budget Office report, A <b>Budgetary</b> Analysis of NASA's New Vision for Space, September 2004. The Space Review estimated in 2010 the cost of Apollo from 1959 to 1973 as $20.4 billion, or $109 billion in 2010 dollars.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, Gill was {{appointed}} manager of Weymouth, then {{bottom of the}} Conference South. With the club already in financial difficulty, many first-team players left. <b>Budgetary</b> constraints meant Gill was unable to bring in replacements, and after 44 days in post, he resigned, feeling the job had become untenable. Weymouth's chairman claimed the cost of travelling from his Midlands home {{was a factor in}} his departure, a suggestion that Gill refuted. In mid-2010, he joined Bristol Rovers as youth team coach. He led the team to the third round of the FA Youth Cup, in which they lost narrowly to Aston Villa's youth team, before a management restructure at the club resulted in his departure.|$|E
5|$|Its {{decisions}} are made by qualified majority voting in most areas, unanimity in others, or just simple majority for procedural issues. Usually where it operates unanimously, it only needs to consult the Parliament. However, in most areas the ordinary legislative procedure applies meaning both Council and Parliament share legislative and <b>budgetary</b> powers equally, meaning both have to agree for a proposal to pass. In a few limited areas the Council may initiate new EU law itself.|$|E
