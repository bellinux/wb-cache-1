500|$|Beyoncé {{begins the}} first verse {{of the song}} in a near-whisper, [...] "I thought that things like this get better with time / <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> need you / Why is that?" [...] The latter rhetorical {{question}} reappears throughout the song. In the chorus lines, she questions herself, [...] "I miss you / But if I got with you, could it feel the same?" [...] From the second verse and onwards, the song finds Beyoncé [...] "vocalizing an internal battle, alternately desperate and calm", as stated by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle. She starts to sing in a double voice; her lower vocal notes are set as the song's base, while her voice in a heightened key is played over it. In the second verse, she sings, [...] "The words don’t ever seem to come out right / <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> mean em", pining for her ex-love interest and feeling self-conscious for doing so, [...] "It hurts my pride {{to tell you how}} I feel, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> need to" [...] before asking again, [...] "Why is that?". The bridge features Beyoncé chanting, [...] "No matter who you are / It is so simple / A feeling / But it’s everything." ...|$|E

He underwent therapy for his parents' divorce, but called it a [...] "waste of time" [...] explaining that his parents could not [...] "accept the fact that I might have been OK with it. I cried my eyes out and kicked and screamed and said, 'Why?' and all the things you do when you find out. A few days later I was fine <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> had to go to therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Bakshi was {{promoted}} to director. His first assignment was the series Sad Cat. Bakshi {{and his wife had}} separated by then, giving him the time to animate each short alone. Bakshi was dissatisfied with the traditional role of a Terrytoons director: [...] "We didn't really 'direct' like you'd think. We were 'animation directors,' because the story department controlled the storyboards. We couldn't affect anything, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> tried. I'd re-time, mix up soundtracks—I'd fuck with it so I could make it my own." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the band}} {{have since been}} dismissive and {{critical}} of the work. Recalling the album in later years, Waters said: [...] "Ummagumma – what a disaster!", while in 1995, Gilmour described the album as [...] "horrible". In a 1984 interview, Mason said: [...] "I {{thought it was a}} very good and interesting little exercise, the whole business of everyone doing a bit. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> feel really that that's quite a good example of the sum being greater than the parts..." [...] Later, he described it as [...] "a failed experiment", adding that [...] "the most significant thing is that we didn't do it again".|$|E

500|$|PewDiePie {{formerly}} put out videos {{with a high}} frequency, {{something he}} scaled down in 2014. By early 2017, he had uploaded almost 3,500 videos to his channel, around 400 {{of which have been}} made private. In March 2017, PewDiePie commented that his channel was running on a daily output, stating, [...] " [...] a lot of challenges in doing daily content, it's stupid. I really shouldn't be doing it, I really should just fucking go back and upload twice a week or some shit, and then take a step back, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> really, really love the daily challenge—the daily grind—of just being like, 'hey, I'm gonna make a video today, no matter what.'

500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{although}} [...] "Keep It Together" [...] sonically {{pays tribute to}} Sly and the Family Stone, the lyrics talk about the realization of how important Madonna's family has been {{as a form of}} stability in her life, especially in the line [...] "Brothers and sisters, They've always been there for me, We have a connection, Home is where the heart should be". The lyrics follow the course of Madonna's rise from figuratively being a [...] "hungry sibling" [...] ("I'm gonna leave this place, So I can forget every single hungry face") to being a superstar ("I hit the big time <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> get the blues, Everyone's a stranger, City life can get to you").|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Young Girls" [...] follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern. It {{begins with the}} singer [...] "dumbly" [...] trying to get noticed by [...] "these bright-eyed honeys", since he can't help to fall for their [...] "dubious charms", despite [...] "recognizing [...] sin while indulging in it". The song's lyrics {{are in the same}} vein as Gary Puckett & The Union Gap's [...] "Young Girl" [...] and The Knack's [...] "My Sharona" [...] as pointed out by HitFix's Melinda Newman. She added, the lyrics are [...] "sweet" [...] and tortuous as he sings [...] "Oh, I still dream of a simple life/ Boy meets girl/ makes her his wife/ But love don’t exist when you live like this... All these roads steer me wrong/ <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> drive them all night long/ all night long". There is a {{sentiment}} of [...] "lament" [...] in the song, [...] "Oh you young wild girls/ You’ll be the death of me".|$|E

500|$|Lee {{conceptualized}} {{the video}} around {{the lyrics to}} the song: [...] "It's kind of about exposing that it's fake. And the video's more {{along the lines of}} exposing the real behind-the-scenes [...] of some of these people. It's basically showing the glamorous lifestyle and the depressed, selfish misery behind it. [...] It's like beating a dead horse at this point, but at the time Britney Spears was just coming out. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> think it's relevant." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "fans will get to see Amy Lee like never before. Instead of her homemade wings and signature gothic garb, the clip finds Lee dressed alternately as a wholesome teenager, a kitschy pop idol and a softly lit glamazon." [...] Amy Lee portrays the life of a model who promotes products by a company called [...] "Lies". The music video focuses on the struggles that Lee's character suffers with because of her modeling career and her opposite lifestyle.|$|E
500|$|The D-Day {{scenes were}} shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, {{just east of}} Curracloe, County Wexford, Ireland. Hanks {{recalled}} to Roger Ebert that although {{he realized it was}} a movie, the experience still hit him hard, stating, [...] "The first day of shooting the D-Day sequences, I was {{in the back of the}} landing craft, and that ramp went down and I saw the first 1-2-3-4 rows of guys just getting blown to bits. In my head, of course, I knew it was special effects, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> wasn't prepared for how tactile it was." [...] Filming began June 27, 1997, and lasted for two months. Some shooting was done in Normandy, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer and Calvados. Other scenes were filmed in England, such as a former British Aerospace factory in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Thame Park, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. Production was due to also take place in Seaham, County Durham, but government restrictions disallowed this.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the album brought wealth to all {{four members of the}} band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a {{collector}} of upmarket cars. Some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. [...] Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project. [...] Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the {{success of the}} album, Mason has praised his role. [...] In 2003, Parsons reflected: [...] "I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it. [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout the serial, Sue Ellen often {{suffered}} {{emotional abuse}} {{from her husband}} J.R., who was the primary antagonist of the show. Linda Gray described Sue Ellen as being, [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} characters on TV in the 1980s. She was the original Desperate Housewife. She led the way for all those girls." [...] She also added, [...] "The more successful we became, the more glamorous and fashionable the clothes became. We set fashion trends in the 80s. Those shoulder pads did get a bit wild. They had to make doors bigger in the end." [...] In an interview with The Telegraph, she said: [...] "It was kind of exciting. I played this neurotic, psychotic, alcoholic weirdo. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> say she was the most interesting female on television in the eighties." [...] The character of Sue Ellen has gone through an addiction to alcohol, which she returned to every time something went extremely wrong with her life. Gray was particularly fond of doing these scenes. She commented, ...|$|E
500|$|Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone {{wrote that}} though the song {{may not be}} an obvious single, it remains one of the finest tracks on the record. Ben Cardew of Music Week called [...] "I Care" [...] an [...] "early highlight" [...] on 4, further praising its {{instrumentation}} {{and the fact that the}} song [...] "feels touched with sadness, largely thanks to a fantastic chorus". He also noted that [...] "I Care" [...] bears resemblance to some of The Neptunes' [...] "classy early tracks". Andy Gill of The Independent wrote that [...] "I Care" [...] makes good use of Surfer Blood's 2010 song [...] "Twin Peaks"' two-chord motif. Chad Grischow of IGN commented [...] "I Care" [...] is one of the songs on which the Beyoncé's vocals are superior to the lyrics, [...] "as the lame hook pleads, 'But I care / I know you don't care too much / <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> care'". NMEs Hamish MacBain showed depreciation the guitar solo, the lyrics and the [...] "off-kilter drums and moody synths" [...] on [...] "I Care". [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph viewed [...] "I Care" [...] as an old-fashioned power ballad.|$|E
500|$|The Franciscan Padre Luis Sotelo came to {{our country}} to spread the faith of God.

However, {{in order to encourage}} my subjects to become Christians, I wish that you send missionaries of the Franciscan church. I guarantee that {{you will be able to}} build a church and that your missionaries will be protected. I also wish that you select and send a bishop as well. Because of that, I have sent one of my samurai, Hasekura Rokuemon, as my representative to accompany Luis Sotelo across the seas to Rome, to give you a stamp of obedience and to kiss your feet. Further, as our country and Nueva España are neighbouring countries, could you intervene so that we can discuss with the King of Spain, for the benefit of dispatching missionaries across the seas."

500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2010, Waters {{commenced}} The Wall Live tour, {{an updated}} version of the original Pink Floyd shows, featuring a complete performance of The Wall. Waters told the Associated Press that The Wall Tour will likely be his last, stating: [...] "I'm not as young as I used to be. I'm not like B.B. King, or Muddy Waters. I'm not a great vocalist or a great instrumentalist or whatever, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> have the fire in my belly, and I have something to say. I have a swan song in me and I think this will probably be it." [...] At The O2 Arena in London on 12 May 2011, Gilmour and Mason once again appeared with Waters and Gilmour performing [...] "Comfortably Numb", and Gilmour and Mason joining Waters for [...] "Outside the Wall". For the first half of 2012, Waters' tour topped worldwide concert ticket sales having sold more than 1.4 million tickets globally. As of 2013, The Wall Live is the highest-grossing tour of all time by a solo artist. Waters performed at [...] at Madison Square Garden on 12 December 2012. On 24 July 2015, Waters headlined the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, Rhode Island. Waters was accompanied by the band My Morning Jacket and two singers from the group Lucius.|$|E
500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in the third season where Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Emerson comments [...] "Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science". Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> think it was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, she has this amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her". During season four the producers deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether Ben {{was a part of the}} Oceanic 6 (six survivors of the plane crash that make it off the Island) after he appeared in one of Sayid's flashforwards.|$|E
