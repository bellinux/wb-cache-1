5|$|At {{the time}} of the 1966 smog, air quality {{measurements}} were recorded from only a single station, the Harlem Courthouse building on East 121st Street, run by Braverman and his staff of 15.

The Interstate Sanitation Commission, a regional agency run <b>by</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> New Jersey, and Connecticut and headquartered at Columbus Circle, also relied on the Harlem Courthouse laboratory. Formed in 1936, the advisory agency was authorized in 1962 <b>by</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and New Jersey to oversee air pollution issues.|$|E
