500|$|For {{the series}} almost two-minute long title sequence, Karin Winslow rented {{a car and}} with the help of a camera {{assistant}} traveled in the eight featured countries of the first season and captured over a hundred shots. [...] "My directive from Lana was to go out and describe each country <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see; find the nuances, find the food, find what people are doing, get a feel for the place," [...] said Winslow. In the second season some of the footage was replaced by new shots, including a shot of the Wachowskis' parents. The closing credits of each episode credit Winslow for the [...] "main title design".|$|E
500|$|Hartley {{is quick}} to point out that before [...] "Justice", the series did not focus on [...] "the costumes and the capes, the flying and the superhero stuff", because they have their [...] "no flights, no tights" [...] rule in effect. That changed with [...] "Justice", and Hartley {{suggested}} that the actors really had to commit themselves to their roles while wearing the costumes, [...] "otherwise you look like a standup comedian who doesn't like his jokes very much". Young stated that he was one of the luckiest out of the group, because he only had to wear a silver vest and regular pants, unlike Ritchson, who had to put on a [...] "onesie Speedo". Ritchson felt you could get distracted <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were wearing, but it was best to try to take your mind off of the subject. Hartley, Ritchson, and Young stated that they felt sorry for Gallner for having to wear a costume that they believed [...] "sucked". The group described Gallner's costume as something his mom might have made with [...] "some cotton fabric and a Magic Marker".|$|E
2500|$|Hopkins said {{said she}} is [...] "pushing back the walls closing in on freedom of speech" [...] at a Church and Media conference in October 2015. Claiming to be [...] "the new Jesus" [...] during her speech, she said: [...] "I have never apologised for {{anything}} I’ve said. I find it very disappointing when people apologise. You should have the positive moral attitude to stand <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say".|$|E
5000|$|Disclaimer (Task): Try to get {{others to}} comply <b>by</b> downplaying <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are {{asking them to}} do. That is, try to gain their {{compliance}} <b>by</b> indicating that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{want them to do}} isn't what they think it is and shouldn't pose a problem; it isn't awful, effortful, difficult, or dumb. Example: [...] "Updating the database shouldn't take that much time." ...|$|R

2500|$|Warbucks {{became much}} more {{ruthless}} in later years. After catching yet another gang of Annie kidnappers {{he announced that he}} [...] "wouldn't think of troubling the police with you boys", implying that while he and Annie celebrated their reunion, the Asp and his men took the kidnappers away to be lynched. In another Sunday strip, published during World War II, a war-profiteer expresses the hope that the conflict would last another 20 years. An outraged member of the public physically assaults the man for his opinion, claiming revenge for his two sons who have already been killed in the fighting. When a passing policeman is about to intervene, Annie talks him out of it, suggesting, [...] "It's better some times to let folks settle some questions <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> might call democratic processes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, New York's Brooklyn Public Library also {{banned the}} book due to [...] "bad word choice" [...] and Huck's having [...] "not only itched but scratched" [...] within the novel, which was {{considered}} obscene. When {{asked by a}} Brooklyn librarian about the situation, Twain sardonically replied: I am greatly troubled <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say. I wrote 'Tom Sawyer' & 'Huck Finn' for adults exclusively, & it always distressed me when I find that boys and girls have been allowed access to them. The mind that becomes soiled in youth can never again be washed clean. I know this by my own experience, & to this day I cherish an unappeased bitterness against the unfaithful guardians of my young life, who not only permitted but compelled me to read an unexpurgated Bible through before I was 15 years old. None can do that and ever draw a clean sweet breath again {{on this side of}} the grave.|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Parsons {{received}} a bachelor's degree from the University of Houston. He was prolific during this time, appearing in 17 plays in 3 years. He was {{a founding member of}} Infernal Bridegroom Productions and regularly appeared at the Stages Repertory Theatre. Parsons enrolled in graduate school at the University of San Diego in 1999. He was one of seven students accepted into a special two-year course in classical theater, taught in partnership with the Old Globe Theater. Program director Rick Seer recalled having reservations about admitting Parsons, saying, [...] "Jim is a very specific personality. He's thoroughly original, which is one reason he's been so successful. But we worried, 'Does that adapt itself to classical theater, does that adapt itself to the kind of training that we're doing?' But we decided that he was so talented that we would give him a try and see how it worked out." [...] Parsons enjoyed school and told an interviewer that he would have pursued a doctorate in acting if possible: [...] "school was so safe!.....you frequently would surprise yourself <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were capable of, and you were not surprised by some things." [...] Parsons graduated in 2001 and moved to New York.|$|E
