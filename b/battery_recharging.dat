5|$|The Una-class {{submarine}} (also {{known as}} Type 911) was {{a class of}} six midget submarines built for the Yugoslav Navy at the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata (English: Special objects shipyard) during the 1980s. They were designed {{with the purpose of}} laying small minefields and transporting naval special forces, with or without their submersibles, in shallow waters that were inaccessible for larger submarines. Due to their mission profile that called for a small design as well as the need to stay undetected, they lacked torpedo armament and a generator for <b>battery</b> <b>recharging.</b>|$|E

It measures [...] in length, has {{a draft of}} , a [...] beam and displaces [...] when surfaced or [...] when submerged. It was constructed as a single hull design with the internal compartment divided into three sections: forward (command/steering) position, exit chamber and the propulsion section in the back. During underwater operations two battery groups {{with a total of}} 256 cells power two 20kW Končar electric motors mounted on a single shaft that spins a five blade propeller.

40|$|Plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (pHEVs) could represent the stepping stone {{to move towards}} a more sustainable mobility and combine the benefits of electric powertrains with the high range capability of conventional vehicles. Nevertheless, despite the huge potential in terms of CO 2 emissions reduction, the performance of such vehicles has to be deeply investigated in real world driving conditions considering also the CO 2 production related to <b>battery</b> <b>recharge</b> which, on the contrary, is currently only partially considered by the European regulation to foster the diffusion of pHEVs. Therefore, this paper aims to assess, through numerical simulation, the real performance of a test case pHEV, the energy management system (EMS) of which is targeted to the minimization of its overall CO 2 emissions. The paper highlights, at the same time, {{the relevance of the}} CO 2 production related to the <b>battery</b> <b>recharge</b> from the power grid. Different technologies mixes used to produce the electricity required for the <b>battery</b> <b>recharge</b> are also taken into account in order to assess the influence of this parameter on the vehicle CO 2 emissions. Finally, since the operating cost still represents the main driver in orienting the customer’s choice, an alternative approach for the EMS, targeted to the minimization of this variable, is also analyzed...|$|R

50|$|Anderson had {{previously}} been known as the Anderson Carriage Company (until 1911), producing carriages and buggies since 1884. Production of the electric automobile, powered by a rechargeable lead acid battery, began in 1907. For an additional , an Edison nickel-iron battery was available from 1911 to 1916. The cars were advertised as reliably getting 80 mi between <b>battery</b> <b>recharging,</b> although in one test a Detroit Electric ran 211.3 mi on a single charge. Top speed was only about 20 mph, but this was considered adequate for driving within city or town limits at the time.|$|E

30|$|Despite the {{positive}} outcome {{evident in the}} simulation results, one persistent cause of delay across all scenarios was the <b>battery</b> <b>recharge</b> behavior. The flattening discovery rates in each simulation run are often caused when UAVs run out of batteries around the 20 – 25  min time-frame {{and return to the}} deployment location for a recharge. This happens repeatedly as batteries discharge, sometimes requiring a UAV to fly across the entire area to return to the charging station. Intelligent recharging to handle this behavior could improve results of the algorithms further. For example, future iterations of the search algorithms could integrate <b>battery</b> <b>recharge</b> into their designs, potentially triggering an auto-charge when a UAV flies within a certain distance of its recharge station while its battery life is below a certain threshold.|$|R

5000|$|In the 19th century, {{there was}} {{considerable}} speculation about the potential use of battery locomotives in mines.

5000|$|Until {{the advent}} of nuclear marine propulsion, most 20th-century {{submarines}} used batteries for running underwater and gasoline (petrol) or diesel engines on the surface, and for <b>battery</b> <b>recharging.</b> Early submarines used gasoline, but this quickly gave way to kerosene (paraffin), then diesel, because of reduced flammability. Diesel-electric became the standard means of propulsion. The diesel or gasoline engine and the electric motor, separated by clutches, were initially on the same shaft driving the propeller. This allowed the engine to drive the electric motor as a generator to recharge the batteries and also propel the submarine. The clutch between the motor and the engine would be disengaged when the submarine dived, so that the motor could drive the propeller. The motor could have multiple armatures on the shaft, which could be electrically coupled in series for slow speed and in parallel for high speed (these connections were called [...] "group down" [...] and [...] "group up", respectively).|$|E
