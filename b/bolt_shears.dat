40|$|Abstract In {{conventional}} {{composite construction}} involving hot-rolled steel section, the composite action is usually achieved by using conventional headed shear studs connectors. However, use of headed studs is not practical for cold-formed steel (CFS) section {{due to its}} very thin form {{that is difficult to}} weld. A suitable bolt and nut type shear connector was proposed; experimental tests were carried out to evaluate its performance. This study also investigated the use of Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) integrated with CFS by means of <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors to develop composite action. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to investigate the performance of <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors in SCC integrated with CFS section as composite beam system. Eighteen push-out test specimens comprising of M 12, M 14 and M 16 sized <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connector of grade 8. 8 with longitudinal spacings of 150 mm, 250 mm and 300 mm centers were fabricated, cast and tested until failure. The experimental results showed that all <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors possessed a good shear resistance capacity. Not much difference in strength capacity of specimens with M 14 and M 16 <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors was found, perhaps due to CFS failure. Varying the size and longitudinal spacing of the <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors revealed that the connectors' strength capacity changed slightly between M 14 and M 16 bolts specimens but, significantly for M 12 bolt specimens...|$|R

40|$|Composite action {{between the}} {{concrete}} slab and steel beam {{in a building}} frame is typically achieved by using headed stud shear connectors that are welded to the top flange of the steel beam to produce robust shear connection, but their demolition necessarily is associated with much waste and uses considerable energy. Moreover, the slab is usually cast in situ onto profiled steel decking with conventional reinforcement placed on site, which is time consuming and labour intensive and which can increase the construction costs considerably. This paper describes the results of three push-out tests conducted to determine the load-slip behaviour of deconstructable <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors for precast concrete slabs in a configuration {{which can be used}} in composite beams and joints. In this system, precast “green concrete” slabs having reduced emissions during their manufacture are attached compositely to the steel beam via post-installed pre-tensioned <b>bolt</b> <b>shear</b> connectors. Based on the experimental results, the structural behaviour of these new systems is assessed and compared with traditional stud shear connectors. The test results show that the behaviour of post-installed pretensioned <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors is completely different to stud shear connectors, and these connectors provide reliable and adequate shear connection to composite beams and connections with precast concrete slabs...|$|R

40|$|Bolted {{connection}} failures {{have been}} observed in building fires and large-scale structural fire tests. Limited information is available on plate bearing behavior at elevated temperatures. The failure mode of a shear-tab connection could change from plate bearing failure to <b>bolt</b> <b>shear</b> failure between 400 (degree Celsius) °C to 600 °C. Component-based models {{have been used to}} predict the behavior of bolted connections. Earlier researchers have developed simple mathematical models to represent the force-displacement relationships of <b>bolt</b> <b>shear</b> and plate bearing components of bolted connections. However, these models need to be verified experimentally for US building construction and materials. Therefore, eleven single-bolted lap joint specimens were tested in this research to achieve two objectives. Four specimens were tested to evaluate <b>bolt</b> <b>shear</b> behavior at 400 °C and 600 °C. Seven specimens were tested to evaluate plate bearing behavior at 400 °C and 600 °C. Finite element analysis (FEA) models of single-bolted lap joints were developed and benchmarked using experimental data. Additionally, twenty eight FEA models were analyzed to evaluate the effect of parameters such as edge distance and plate thickness on the behavior of single-bolted lap joints at elevated temperatures. The experimental and analytical results were used to adjust the force-displacement relationship developed by earlier researchers. Overall, the study will help engineers to model and evaluate the fire performance of bolted connections. ...|$|R

40|$|Composite {{construction}} {{is well known}} to be effectively used {{in the construction of}} buildings and bridges using hot rolled steel (HRS) and headed studs connectors. The shear connectors provides the enhancement as established in current design codes. In this paper, the shear connection mechanism was proposed using high strength <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connector to provide composite action between concrete and the steel section. The conventional headed stud shear connector was eliminated since Cold-formed steel (CFS) was used and welding was not practically possible due to thinness nature of the CFS section. Therefore, in this study investigation was carried out on the strength capacity, ductility and the ultimate flexural capacity of the proposed high strength <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connector and the composite beam specimens respectively. Four push-out and two full-scale composite beam specimens were fabricated using high strength M 16 <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connector of Grade 8. 8 connected to the top flanges of the CFS I-section and tested to failure using push-out and four-point bending tests respectively. The results show that ultimate load and ultimate moment capacities of the proposed system were significantly improved by using the proposed connectors. The experimental results were compared with theoretical results based on the provision of Eurocode 4, and good agreement between the results was observed. In conclusion, compared results proved that the ultimate moment capacity of the proposed composite beams can be estimated efficiently by using the constitutive laws as prescribed by Eurocodes and British standards...|$|R

The tensile strength, the shear strength and the deformation modulus of <b>bolt</b> control the <b>shear</b> behavior of a <b>sheared</b> <b>bolted</b> joint. Since the strength and deformation modulus of FG bolt, rock bolt and cable bolt obtained from uniaxial tensile tests are different, their shear behavior in reinforcing joints is accordingly different. Test results showed that the shear stiffness of FG bolted joints decreased gradually from the beginning to end, while the shear stiffness of joints reinforced by rock bolt and cable bolt decreased bi-linearly, which is clearly consistent with their tensile deformation modulus. The <b>bolted</b> joint <b>shear</b> stiffness was highly influenced by bolt pretension in the high stiffness stage for both rock bolt and cable bolt, but not in the low stiffness stage.

Therefore, this study investigates the strength capacity of <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors with cold-formed steel (CFS) section integrated as composite beam in self-compacting concrete. In this paper, four composite beam specimens of dimensions (4500 mm x 1500 mm x 75 mm) with <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors of M 12 and M 14 of grade 8. 8 installed on the upper flanges of the coupled back-to-back CFS I-section with longitudinal spacing’s of 250 mm and 300 mm centers and spaced 75 mm laterally were fabricated, cast and tested to failure using four-point bending test. Shear connector size and the longitudinal spacing were the varied parameters, and their influence was investigated on the ultimate load and ultimate moment capacities. The results showed that, the ultimate load and ultimate moment capacities were both influenced remarkably by the studied parameters. However, results of theoretical analysis, revealed good agreement between the experimental and the theoretical results.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} slab-column {{structures are}} widely used because of their practicality.

Without shear reinforcement, the slab-column connection can undergo brittle punching failure, especially when the structure is subject to lateral loading in seismic zones. The <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> are {{a new type of}} transverse reinforcement developed for retrofit of existing structures against punching. This research focuses on how the <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> can improve the punching-shear capacity and ductility of the existing slab-column connections under vertical service and lateral seismic loads. A set of nine full-scale reinforced concrete slab-column connection specimens were tested under vertical service and cyclic loads. The vertical (gravity) load for each specimen was kept at a constant value throughout the testing. The cyclic lateral drift with increasing intensity was applied to the columns. The specimens were different in number of bolts, concrete strength, number of openings, and level of gravity punching load. Strains in flexural rebars in the slabs, crack widths, lateral loads, and displacements were obtained. The peak lateral load (moment) and its corresponding drift ratio, connection stiffness, crack width, and ductility were compared among different specimens. The testing results show that <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> can increase lateral peak load resisting capacity, lateral drift capacity at peak load, and ductility of the slab-column connections. <b>Shear</b> <b>bolts</b> also change the failure mode of the slab-column connections and increase the energy dissipation capacity.

Thus, a number of experimental and analytical models are available to determine the load transfer capacity of cable bolts mainly in pull-out conditions. On the other hand, studies on the shear performance of cable bolts are limited and are mostly based on experimental studies, which do not accurately simulate the real shear performance of cable <b>bolts.</b> The <b>shear</b> behaviour of cable bolts is significantly affected by pretension load, cable bolt surface profile type, ultimate tensile capacity, rock mass strength and cementitious grout or chemical resin properties.

40|$|In the literature, the {{designing}} of the rolled or welded, doubly symmetrical I- and H-profile bolted splice {{is usually}} {{presented with a}} load combination, which includes axial load, shear {{in one direction and}} bending in respect of strong axis. Because there often exists a load combination with biaxial bending simultaneously, the design method for calculating <b>bolt</b> <b>shear</b> forces in this situation is needed. To design the joint reliable, the distribution of the forces in the joint must be known well. In the nonbearing type joint, the forces of the splice are usually supposed to be distributed in the ratio of the cross-section stiffnesses. With this method, generally acceptable results have been achieved for the joint member stresses. In the bearing type joint, the distribution of the forces for the bolts and splice plates is not as clear as with the non-bearing type splice. In this research, the stiffnesses of the splice members has been used for calculating stresses also in the bearing type splice. This research belongs to the project developing biaxially loaded splice design program in Sweco Rakennetekniikka Oy. It consists of the theoretical calculation and the finite element analysis (FEA), where the calculation results are compared. With the FEA, the distribution of the stresses can be studied {{from the beginning of the}} stress test, with all load combinations. The results of the research are mainly in-line with the FEA. A design program for calculating profile and splice plate stresses and <b>bolt</b> <b>shear</b> forces for biaxially loaded splice was mainly achieved, including both non-bearing and bearing type splice. For achieving an adequate reliability for the results of the calculation, and in some cases, more accurate results, additional research and tests with different types of the splices are needed...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the life}} span of a {{structure}} it may become necessary to retrofit, or strengthen certain components or elements. This may be due to construction errors, changes in use and occupancy, or changes due to material deterioration or damage. Slab-column connections in flat slab structures might need to be strengthened for punching shear. Using steel <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> to strengthen connections for punching shear is a new technique used for retrofit that was developed at the University of Waterloo. If the retrofitted part of the structure is exposed to the atmosphere, or to chemicals such as deicing salts, the steel can corrode, thus furthering to damage the structure. Non-corrosive materials that can replace the steel <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> can be a good practical alternative to steel. Reported in this thesis are the results of research on the development and use of non-corrosive <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> for reinforced concrete interior slab-column connections. Externally applied <b>shear</b> reinforcing <b>bolts</b> provide the punching shear reinforcement strength, while allowing the flexibility and ease of installation of an external application after construction. By providing a bearing area against both sides of the slab surface, the formation of punching shear cracks can be restrained, and the connection can become strengthened against punching shear failure. Three different types of non-corrosive <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> were developed and tested. The first was an off-the-shelf glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bolt / nut product. The two others used two different GFRP core rods with aluminum fittings crimped to their ends. A total of six specimens were tested, four were tested under an increasing static load, while two were tested with an unbalanced pseudo-dynamic lateral load. All six specimens were designed to fail in punching shear before reaching their flexural capacity. The results are compared against previous test results of specimens both unreinforced and reinforced with steel <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> to determine their effectiveness.

The GFRP nut and bolt did not strengthen the connection, and, in fact, decreased its overall strength when compared to the unreinforced specimen. The presence of the GFRP <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> also increased the connection ductility and the deflection capability. In the pseudo-dynamic tests the GFRP <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> significantly increased the amount of energy dissipated by the connection under reverse cyclic loading.

40|$|The {{growth of}} world {{population}} {{will be the}} challenge of the century regarding the carbon footprints. The human activities produce both direct and indirect carbon emission that is contributing to the climate change. The construction industry itself contributes around 30 percent of total carbon emissions in the world. Thus, the challenge is {{to solve the problem of}} meeting the increasing needs and expectations of a growing population while at the same time modifying the current production and consumption patterns to achieve a more sustainable development model. Based on this, the need for the sustainable structural element is inevitable. Extending the exploitation life of the structural element is one of the solutions that should be looked. Reusing instead of recycling the structural element is one of the ways to extend the exploitation life which can reduce the carbon emission. Therefore the innovation in the structural design to reduce the carbon emission is important. The purpose of this thesis is to study the feasibility of a conceptual design of demountable structural system. On the first part of the thesis, it investigated the structural behaviour of a composite floor beam that consists of steel beam, prefabricated concrete deck and a single embedded nut <b>bolt</b> <b>shear</b> connector in the SLS condition. To accommodate fabrication tolerance and construction process, the <b>bolt</b> <b>shear</b> connector must have enough clearance. Various bolt-hole gap in <b>bolt</b> <b>shear</b> connector is applied to see the effect on structural performance of composite floor beam in SLS. The study of demountable composite floor beam is performed by mean of analytical calculations and finite element analysis. It is found that the bolt-hole gap clearance influences the deflection of composite floor beam due to partial interaction between prefabricated concrete deck and steel beam which leads to incomplete interaction of composite floor beam. The bigger hole clearance, the higher deflection occurs on composite floor beam. The second part of the thesis explores the conceptual design of plug and play beam-column connection. The purpose of developing a plug and play beam-column connection is to reduce the construction time so that it is easy to be mounted and demounted. Two conceptual designs have been developed and were evaluated through FEA. The resistance of those two conceptual designs is found to be higher than fin-plate connection while the rotational stiffness of this plug-play connection can be classified as a nominally pinned joint. The last part of the thesis aims to see the possibility of having a non-symmetrical column splice connection on the column. This is interesting for the architect as it provides aesthetic benefit for the façade. The non-symmetrical column splice connection located on the corner is evaluated by FEA. The connection is a combination of end-plate and cover plate splice column connection. Due to unsymmetrical nature of the connection, the resistance and failure mode of the connection is different in a different orientation of the loading...|$|R

A <b>shear</b> <b>bolt</b> consists of an unhardened steel shaft threaded at one end and flared out to form a bearing/anchor surface on the other end. All six specimens were designed to fail in shear before reaching their flexural capacity, two of which were more critical than the others because of the presence of openings simulating utility ducts around the column perimeter. From the tests, comparisons of predicted loads with the failure loads indicated a higher ultimate load for slab reinforced with the bolt system. Similarly, strain measurements from strain gauges attached to the longitudinal steel and deflection profiles of the slab showed that the new method was efficient in increasing the shear capacity of the slabs. In summary, the test program showed that <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> are effective in transforming the behaviour of the slab-column connections from a brittle punching shear failure mode to a more ductile flexural one. Deflection profiles at different load stages, and particularly at failure, show increased deflections for specimens reinforced with bolt reinforcements. This indicates an increased ductility at the connection. Similarly, load and flexural reinforcement strain magnitudes show substantial improvements in the strength of the connections...|$|R

Rather than potting gages {{in a hole}} along axis of bolt, gages are first installed on outside of plastic carrier tube. Tube is then epoxied in axial hole.

40|$|In this study, {{concrete-filled}} tube (CFT) column-to-foundation connections {{were investigated}} experimentally {{to improve the}} design of their structural details. Initially, five different types of foundation connections, which were classified according to the design parameters incorporating the types of anchor <b>bolts,</b> <b>shear</b> connectors, base members, and reinforced bars used, were fabricated. After conducting structural experiments on these foundation models, the performance and capacity of the individual model cases from the test results were compared with each other. The test results showed {{that some of the}} test models designed according to current design guidelines had problems related to the structural details. Therefore, this study proposed an adequate design methodology to improve the performance of foundation components, such as high tension bolt, base frame members, and embedded plate. An analytical investigation of the force-deformation relationship as well as the characteristic strains distributed over the individual foundation components was performed...|$|R
