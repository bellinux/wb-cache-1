The new restrictions were widely seen as stemming from Snowden's revelations.|$|E

25|$|In October 2013, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, {{author of}} the Patriot Act, {{introduced}} a proposal to the House of Representatives called the USA Freedom Act to end the <b>bulk</b> <b>collection</b> of Americans' metadata and reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court. Senators introduced two different reform proposals. One, the USA Freedom Act (H.R. 3361/ S. 1599), would effectively halt “bulk” records collection under the USA Patriot Act, while it also would require a warrant to deliberately search for the e-mail and phone call content of Americans that is collected {{as part of a}} surveillance program targeting foreigners located overseas. Another proposal is the FISA Improvements Act that would preserve the program while strengthening privacy protections. It would also codifying the requirement that analysts have a “reasonable articulable suspicion” that a phone number is associated with terrorism to query the NSA phone records database; requiring that the FISA court promptly review each such determination; and limiting the retention period for phone records. Both proposals share the introduction of a special advocate to promote privacy interests before the FISA court.|$|E

Jones decision, {{in which she}} {{said that in the}} digital age, [...] "It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties," [...] was cited by federal judge Richard Leon in his ruling that the National Security Agency's <b>bulk</b> <b>collection</b> of Americans' telephony records likely violated the Fourth Amendment. [...] Law professors Adam Winkler and Laurence Tribe were among those who said that Sotomayor's Jones concurrence had been influential in calling out the need for a new basis in understanding privacy requirements in a world, as she wrote, [...] "in which people reveal {{a great deal of information}} about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2014, Paul {{joined the}} Tea Party-affiliated {{conservative}} advocacy group FreedomWorks in filing a class-action lawsuit {{charging that the}} federal government's <b>bulk</b> <b>collection</b> of Americans' phone records metadata {{is a violation of}} the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Commenting on the lawsuit at a press conference, Paul said, [...] "I'm not against the NSA, I'm not against spying, I'm not against looking at phone records... I just want you to go to a judge, have an individual's name and [...] a warrant. That's what the Fourth Amendment says." [...] He also said there was no evidence the surveillance of phone metadata had stopped terrorism. Critics, including Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz and Steven Aftergood, the director of the American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, called the lawsuit a political [...] "stunt". Paul's political campaign organization said that the names of members of the public who went to Paul's websites and signed on as potential class-action participants would be available in the organization's database for future campaign use. On the announcement of the filing of the lawsuit, Mattie Fein, the spokeswoman for and former wife of attorney Bruce Fein, complained that Fein's intellectual contribution to the lawsuit had been stolen and that he had not been properly paid for his work. Paul's representatives denied the charge, and Fein issued a statement saying that Mattie Fein had not been authorized to speak for him on the matter and that he had in fact been paid for his work on the lawsuit.|$|E

40|$|This Note {{will argue}} that the attorney-client {{privilege}} is justified not only by the popular instrumentalist rationales, but also by noninstrumentalist thinking. It will further argue that Federal Rule of Evidence 502 gives federal courts the tools to protect the attorney-client privilege in light of <b>bulk</b> data <b>collection.</b> Even where courts do not find that traditional modes of communication constitute reasonable steps to protect a confidential communication, general considerations of fairness—as noted in Rule 502 ’s committee notes—should encourage courts to uphold attorney-client privilege in future situations of <b>bulk</b> data <b>collection</b> disclosures. Part I will discuss the establishment, development, and operations of the national security surveillance and signals intelligence apparatuses in the United States. It will also examine the legal basis for state surveillance and <b>bulk</b> data <b>collection</b> programs and legal challenges to those programs with an eye toward the issue of attorney-client privilege.

Additionally, the banner urged people to call Congress and voice opposition to the FISA Improvements Act, which the ACLU called [...] "a dream come true for the NSA" [...] that would [...] "codify the NSA's unconstitutional call-records program and allow <b>bulk</b> <b>collection</b> of location data from mobile phone users." ...|$|E

2500|$|The US {{district}} court judge for the District of Columbia, Richard Leon, declared [...] on December 16, 2013 that the mass collection of metadata of Americans’ telephone records by the National Security Agency probably violates the fourth amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. “Given the limited record before me {{at this point in}} the litigation – most notably, the utter lack of evidence that a terrorist attack has ever been prevented because searching the NSA database was faster than other investigative tactics – I have serious doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting time-sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism.” “Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of showing that their privacy interests outweigh the government’s interest in collecting and analysing bulk telephony metadata and therefore the NSA’s <b>bulk</b> <b>collection</b> program is indeed an unreasonable search under the fourth amendment,” he wrote.|$|E

We quantified insect feeding on 3, 599 leaves from the speciose Laguna del Hunco flora (Chubut, Argentina), which dates to the early Eocene climatic optimum (52 million years ago) and compared the results with three well preserved, rich, and identically analyzed early- and middle-Eocene floras from the following sites in North America: Republic, WA; Green River, UT; and Sourdough, WY. We found significantly more damage diversity at Laguna del Hunco than in the North American floras, whether measured on <b>bulk</b> <b>collections</b> or on individual plant species, for both damage morphotypes and feeding groups. An ancient history of rich, specialized plant–insect associations on diverse plant lineages in warm climates may be a major factor contributing to the current biodiversity of South America...|$|R

Inherent in such trials are questions of how results vary with inoculum source or inoculum density. Seedlings from a <b>bulked</b> <b>collection</b> of cones from trees on the Shoshone National Forest were inoculated in 2001. Treatments consisted of a factorial of two geographic sources of inoculum and three levels (densities) of inoculum. Early results showed high infection levels (needle spots and/or cankers) across all treatments {{within a year of}} inoculation. Through March 2006, the percentage of trees with stem symptoms for the six treatment combinations varied from 73. 7 to 100 percent, while rust mortality varied from 60. 4 to 83. 8 percent. Infection and mortality levels were similar for the mid- and high inoculum density treatments. The surviving trees were re-inoculated in September 2005 and will be followed further to examine the level of resistance in this Shoshone population...|$|R
