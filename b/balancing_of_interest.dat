40|$|This paper {{examines}} the current representation of Hispanics in state government throughout the United States. The analysis explores Hispanic educational attainment {{in relation to}} representative bureaucracies in state government. The findings of this paper suggest further research to be conducted in explaining bureaucratic representation beyond Hispanic growth rates in demographics. Bureaucratic representation, as a leadership tool in the achievement of common goals, appears to be challenged by underlying factors {{that relate to the}} attainment of a “critical mass ” in state government demographics. 2 Leadership as a social dynamic is driven by context. Northouse (2001) defines leadership as a group process where leaders use influence to achieve a common goal. Leaders not only facilitate the process of goal attainment, but also provide direction. The application of leadership in state government, in the attainment common goals, is an intricate process. The leadership of state governments, as democracy catalysts, is challenged by the ever-changing demographic composition of states. The role of leaders in government becomes a function of a constant <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> representation. Leadership in state government throughout the United States can be regarded as the translation of common goals into common action. For the purposes of this paper, leadership in government is defined as the crystallization of representative bureaucracy theory in the facilitation of common goal attainment. Research suggests that the advantages of representative bureaucracy are channeled in two ways: policy-making and implementation. This paper {{examines the}} representation of Hispanics in state government in light of their increasing population rates and political influence throughout United States...|$|E
40|$|Public private {{partnership}} (PPP) is {{an alternative}} method for the financing of public infrastructure, based {{on the concept of}} financing public undertakings by private funds. The technique {{can be used in a}} number of different sectors such as transportation, energy, waste management, housing, education and healthcare. However, the focus for this essay is made to large-scale capital-intensive infrastructure projects such as, inter alia, motorways, railroads, bridges, water supply and energy facilities. PPP is commonly used all over Europe, particularly in England, and have recently grown exceedingly in the Nordic countries. Despite this European trend, the Swedish government has so far been hostile against making use of the PPP. However, given the positive outcome from the development that has taken place in the Nordic countries, Sweden is likely to follow the track. There are various forms of private public partnerships, however, the basic concept is that a private company, solely established for the purpose of carrying out the project in question, takes the primary responsibility for the financing, designing, building and operating of a project facility, which is then transferred to the public sector. Using such a single purpose vehicle (SPV) reduces the risks for the project sponsors thus making it possible for them to attain a “non-recourse financing”. This means that the lenders have no recourse against the project sponsors and therefore only may take recourse to the assets held by the project company for the repayment of their loans and for interest payments on such loans. However, the value of the asset of the project company, at least at the beginning of the construction phase, is significantly limited and uncertain. There is often no established market for project assets such as a power plant or a motorway and the facilities are in general owned by the public sector, rather than the project company. The non-recourse financing technique in addition to the fact that there is no real asset to take security in thus exposes the creditors to considerable risk. The lenders are forced to almost solely rely on the future revenues of the project company. Both the creditors and the equity holders therefore focus their attention on the prospective future cash flow of the project company. The most important objective for the creditors as well as for the equity holders is thus to keep the project running. The future revenues are generally provided by the public sector party, once the project is finalized. Hence, the key threat is a public sector party cancellation of the contract. In order to make these projects “bankable” the parties involved are forced to create innovative contractual solutions taking these foreseeable conditions into consideration. Apart from the traditional form of security, various forms of “quasi security” are often used. One of the most important features in this regard is direct agreements. Direct agreements are entered into between the project company, the banks financing a project and the parties to the project’s key underlying commercial contracts. The key contracts for this purpose would typically include the concession agreement, the main construction contract, any operation and maintenance agreement, any long-term supply contract and any long-term sales contracts. The objective of a direct agreement is basically to enable the banks to “step into the shoes of the project company” if it defaults in its loan obligations. The agreements provide a right for the creditors to assume the project company’s rights and obligations under the contract for a specified period of time or allow the transfer of the contract to a separate company established by the banks for this purpose. If such an assumption is made, then the project contractors can not terminate the defaulted contracts prematurely, their cancellation rights are to say “frozen”. Hence, direct agreements draw third parties into a projects finance agreement in that compulsory consent to accomplish an eventual assignment is obtained prior to such transfer is being considered. In doing so, the lenders can hinder third parties from exercising their contractual rights. However, direct agreements are met in accordance with English law, which is generally considered more ‘creditor friendly’ than the Germanic law tradition. Albeit the parties involved have agreed upon this solution, implications in the Swedish jurisdiction may render these agreements ineffective. The key threat to the efficiency of using direct agreements in Sweden is the potential bankruptcy of the project company. The bankruptcy itself does not necessarily create significant complications for the lenders, however the expected right of the bankruptcy’s estate to enter into the debtor’s contracts exposes the lender to higher risk. The purpose of this essay is to examine the efficiency of direct agreements used in private public partnerships and project financing in general, relating to large-scale infrastructure projects, in the light of Swedish law, particularly with regard to the project company’s bankruptcy and the principal rule of the estate’s right to enter into the debtor’s contracts. The two basic questions are, firstly whether the bankrupt estate is entitled to enter into the project company’s contracts, (or from a contractual perspective, whether the solvent party is entitled to cancel its contractual obligations) and secondly whether the right of the estate to accede to the project company’s contract is mandatory and hence an agreement opposing such right is void against the estate. The essay seeks to discuss these basic questions de lege lata as well as de lege ferenda in Sweden and to compare the legal situation in the Nordic countries and in England. Furthermore, the purpose of this essay is to suggest solutions of the problems evinced, principally to devise a law reform. The essay holds that the two perspectives deliberated in doctrine, the solvent party as opposes to the bankrupt estate and its creditors prove inadequate pertaining to project finance. There is considerably more interest to take into account that renders the traditional argumentation invoked in legal literature inapplicable for the particular circumstances at stake in project finance. The concept of “all creditors” must be modulated. The interest of protection noticeably varies among different creditors and hence there are reasons to give preference for the syndicated lenders who comprise the major part of the creditors and those subjected to the major risks. It is held that none of the likely risks expressed in legal literature or key arguments invoked in favour of the bankruptcy perspective is pertinent considering project finance where the lenders have step in rights. There are incitements to consider other creditors in the contracting of the solvent party and the debtor prior to the bankruptcy. The solvent party does incur an inconsiderable further damage or inconvenience beyond what he would have suffered if the contracts instead had been cancelled on the day of the bankruptcy judgement. Besides this inconvenience is not a matter of concern solely for the single contracting party however encompasses the public interest of infrastructure and the quality of such. Besides the lender’s step in comprise a substitute providing a noticeably better solution. The most efficient and favourable solution for “all creditors” will be achieved by entitling the lender’s and hence not the estate to enter into the project company’s contracts, particularly the project agreement. It may certainly be questioned why the estate should be considered as a “new third party” not possible to include in direct agreements prior to a bankruptcy, when all major creditors participate in such agreement. However, the essay states that de lege lata as well as de lege ferenda remain uncertain. The principal rule de lege lata give preference to the right of entry for the estate in analogy with the 63 § SAG. Albeit exceptions can be made in analogy with anticipatory breach such deviations from the basic principle is subjected to inconveniences. The debate de lege ferenda indicates a highly trend towards company reorganisation and increased priority of secured creditors. The objectives behind the new insolvency rules and the essence of the debate of incorporating the two insolvency proceedings are considerably more likely to be achieved if the lender’s are entitled to enter into the debtor’s contract. The commission advocates flexibility and the importance of giving all the creditors incentives to participate. It can be questioned if the best way to achieve such goals is through mandatory rules is. Conversely, the principle of freedom of contract and encouraging private work out insensitive, as provided for in direct agreements, is without doubt a better solution for the particular circumstances in project finance. In conclusion, a <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> de lege lata, definitely points in favour of entitling the lender’s to step in and the solvent party to cancel and hence not entitling the estate to accede to the debtor’s contracts. However, uncertainty prevails. Besides, it is just a matter of time before a legal reform is brought into force, prescribing general rules in favour of the bankruptcy estate to enter. It is thus essential to carve out exceptions for project finance and public private partnership in such proposal. Against this background the essay concludes with a proposal of a law reform...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesControversy {{surrounds}} the upstream petroleum industry. Although {{the benefit of}} petroleum resources is beyond dispute, the exploitation of petroleum resources comes at a price, as history has shown time and again. Not only does petroleum exploitation have {{detrimental effects on the}} environment, but host countries often are worse off than countries with little or no petroleum resources. This "resource curse" is partially the result of flawed regulatory frameworks for petroleum resource extraction in host countries. This thesis identifies three elements that must be present in a country's regulatory framework for petroleum extraction if the resource curse phenomenon is to be avoided and benefit s from petroleum are to be maximised. These elements are: transparency, accountability and a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> between the petroleum companies and the host nation. Namibia and South Africa are not yet major players in the international upstream petroleum industry. There is accordingly not much academic engagement with petroleum law in these two jurisdictions. The courts have also not yet had the opportunity to scrutinise the legislation regulating the upstream petroleum industries of South Africa and Namibia. There are, however, indications that both countries may possess viable quantities of petroleum resources. In anticipation of the possibility of finding commercially viable quantities of petroleum, South Africa and Namibia have enacted legislation to regulate the upstream petroleum industry, but the efficiency of the legislation, specifically how it reflects the elements of transparency, accountability and <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> have not yet been considered. The research for this thesis is driven by the question of how the regulatory framework for petroleum exploitation in South Africa and Namibia embraces the elements of transparency, accountability and <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this thesis is to examine the regulatory frameworks for upstream petroleum resources in South Africa and Namibia in anticipation of the demands that will be placed on law as the sectors grow.
