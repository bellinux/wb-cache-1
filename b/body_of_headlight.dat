Although much literature has been published concerning daytime vehicle detection, little has been published concerning nighttime vehicle detection. In this study, a nighttime vehicle detection algorithm, consisting <b>of</b> <b>headlight</b> segmentation, headlight pairing and headlight tracking, is proposed. First, the pixels <b>of</b> the <b>headlights</b> are segmented in nighttime traffic images, {{through the use of}} the thresholding method. Then the pixels <b>of</b> the <b>headlights</b> are grouped and labeled, to analyze the characteristics of related components, such as area, location and size. Headlights are paired based on their location and size and then tracked via a tracking procedure designed to detect vehicles. Vehicles with only one headlight or those with three or four headlights are also detected. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is robust and effective in detecting vehicles in nighttime traffic...|$|R

40|$|Todays {{rasterization}} graphics hardware provides impressive {{speed and}} features {{making it the}} standard tool for interactively visualising virtual prototypes early in the industrial design process. However, due to inherent limitations of the rasterization approach many optical effects can only be approximated. For many products, in particular in the car industry, the resulting visual quality and realism is inadequate {{as the basis for}} critical design decisions. Thus the original goal of using virtual prototyping â€” significantly reducing the number of costly physical mockups â€” often cannot be achieved. Interactive ray tracing on a small cluster of PCs is emerging as an alternative visualization technique achieving the required accuracy, quality, and realism. In a case study this paper demonstrates the advantages of using interactive ray tracing for a typical design situation in the car industry: visualizing the prototype <b>of</b> <b>headlights.</b> Due to the highly reflective and refractive nature <b>of</b> <b>headlights,</b> proper quality could only be achieved using a fast interactive ray tracing system. 1...|$|R
