40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel connection system which allows fast, {{safe and reliable}} coupling and uncoupling of two sections of a freight wagon body {{as part of a}} <b>bimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system. The connection system allows the time for loading and unloading a truck trailer to be reduced to almost one-half of the current duration. The connection system is composed of a cylindrical clamping pin with three conical shoulders at one end and an axial slide. A crank mechanism in a cylindrical guide is used to lock the clamp. The crank is connected to the pin and symmetric piston rods are connected to the moving clamp, other auxiliary members constrain the clamp. ?? IMechE 2013...|$|E
40|$|Longitudinal dunes are {{extremely}} rare on Mars, but constitute a substantial fraction of terrestrial desert dunes. We report finding isolated examples of longitudinal dunes on Mars and relate their occurence to expected sand transport regimes. Terrestrial longitudinal dunes form in <b>bimodal</b> and multimodal <b>transport</b> regimes. General circulation models and streak {{data indicate that}} <b>bimodal</b> and multimodal <b>transport</b> of sand should be very rare on Mars. Thus the dearth of longitudinal dunes on Mars is consistant with their apparent formation conditions on Earth...|$|R
5000|$|Many major {{automotive}} manufacturers, including General Motors, Ford, Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen, Audi, Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and Volvo, {{are testing}} driverless car systems as of 2013. BMW has been testing driverless systems since around 2005, while in 2010, Audi sent a driverless Audi TTS {{to the top}} of Pike’s Peak at close to race speeds. In 2011, GM created the EN-V (short for Electric Networked Vehicle), an autonomous electric urban vehicle. In 2012, Volkswagen began testing a [...] "Temporary Auto Pilot" [...] (TAP) system that will allow a car to drive itself at speeds of up to 80 mph on the highway. Ford has conducted extensive research into driverless systems and vehicular communication systems. In January 2013, Toyota demonstrated a partially self-driving car with numerous sensors and communication systems. Other programs in the field include the 2GetThere passenger vehicles from the Netherlands and the DARPA Grand Challenge in the USA; some plans for <b>bimodal</b> public <b>transport</b> systems include autonomous cars as a component.|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{an example of}} {{timetable}} synchronization of public transport in Ljubljana. The example is set as QSAP optimization problem as introduced by Schröder and Solchenbach (2006). The task is to improve transfer possibilities between both modes of public <b>transport</b> (<b>bimodal,</b> intermodal synchronization) without worsening transfer quality inside the system of Ljubljana city bus transport (intramodal synchronization). This is achieved by small shifts (several minutes) of bus timetables. The observed area is traffic joint around central Ljubljana train station, which includes Kolodvor and Bavarski dvor bus stops. The time horizon {{of the problem is}} a typical weekday. Results are evaluated at the level of entire system and at the level of some chosen connections...|$|R
40|$|The complex {{dynamics}} of partial bed-load transport {{in a series}} of well-controlled laboratory experiments are explored systematically and simulated by a stochastic model in this study. Flume experiments show that the leading front of bed-load on a 20 -m-long, mixed-size gravel-bed moves anomalously, where the transient transport rate of the accelerating front varies with the observation time scale. In addition, observations show that moving particles may experience <b>bimodal</b> <b>transport</b> (i. e., coexistence of long trapping time and large jump length) related to bed coarsening and the formation of clusters on a heterogeneous gravel-bed, which is distinguished from the traditional theory of hiding-exposing interactions among mixed-size particles. A fractional derivative model is finally applied to characterize the overall behavior of partial bed-load transport, including the coexistence of the sub-diffusion and non-local feature caused by turbulence and the micro-relief within an armor layer.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a network equilibrium formulation for modeling commuters' travel choices in a <b>bimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system with park-and-ride (P&R) trips while the total demand is elastic to the congestion {{level of the}} network. A super-network approach is adopted in the proposed model. It is assumed that commuters' trips are categorized into two types, auto mode only and a combined mode with both auto and transit modes. The former {{is referred to as}} the pure mode trip and the latter as the P&R mode trip. The proposed model simultaneously considers the commuter's choice of the pure mode versus the P&R mode, the choice of parking location for the pure mode, the choice of transfer point for the P&R mode, as well as the route choice for each mode. The demand elasticity of transport system, the capacity constraints of transport facilities, and the congestion interaction throughout the super-network are also explicitly incorporated into the proposed model. The results of the numerical experiment show the following key findings: (i) traditional parking/P&R models may overestimate or underestimate travel demand distribution over network; (ii) parking/P&R, transit scheduling, and carpooling schemes bring significant impacts on commuters' travel behavior and network performance; and (iii) different transport policies may be to some extent mutually substituted. © 2007 Tsinghua University Press. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} equity and {{efficiency}} of pricing strategies in a <b>bimodal</b> <b>transport</b> network with elastic demand and heterogeneous users {{on the basis of}} logit-based discrete choice models. The network consists of a railway line and a parallel highway with a bottleneck that provide daily commuting services between a residential area and a workplace. On the basis of two user groups differing in values of time, first-best pricing is shown to remain possible through the use of anonymous charges under the stochastic user equilibrium condition. Second-best pricing is also examined, in which an equity constraint is introduced to ensure that some users, if not all, are at least not worse off from implementing the pricing at expectation level. The efficiency, equity, demand realization, and modal split resulting from various pricing strategies are investigated and numerically validated in a simplified real network connecting the Kowloon urban area to Hong Kong, China, International Airport. It was found that the equity-constrained second-best pricing can result in a win-win situation for society and users. The efficiency and welfare gains depend heavily on the values of time of user groups and the number of users in each group. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{photovoltaic}} systems comprising donor polymers and acceptor fullerene derivatives are attractive for inexpensive energy harvesting. Extensive research on polymer solar cells has provided {{insight into the}} factors governing device-level efficiency and stability. However, the detailed investigation of nanoscale structures is still challenging. Here we demonstrate the analysis and modification of unidentified surface aggregates. The aggregates are characterized electrically by Kelvin probe force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM), whereby the correlation between local electrical potential and current confirms a defective charge <b>transport.</b> <b>Bimodal</b> AFM modification confirms that the aggregates exist {{on top of the}} solar cell structure, and is used to remove them and to reveal the underlying active layer. The systematic analysis of the surface aggregates suggests that the structure consists of PCBM molecules...|$|R
40|$|In Austria, {{as in the}} {{majority}} of EU countries, greenhouse gas emissions are currently rising most strongly in the transport sector. In view of the Kyoto commitments and the EU's greenhouse-gas policy, the reduction of transport-related emissions therefore is a matter of great urgency. This article first identifies a dozen transport policy measures that Austria can implement on its own and that promise most significant emission reduction. We then evaluate these measures with regard to their employment effect and analyse their impact according to income groups. As our findings show, the economic instruments of car road pricing and a fuel tax increase potentially result in the strongest emission reductions; depending on the use of revenues thus generated, they can be associated with benign employment and distributional impacts. A wider use of bicycles as well as the increase of <b>bimodal</b> freight <b>transport</b> and the extension of truck road pricing to the entire road network follow next both in terms of emission reductions achievable by 2010 and with regard to their employment and distributional impacts. Increased rail investment and measures to foster regional public transport, as well as mobility management, are less effective measures to reduce emissions. However, rail investment has strong positive employment impacts, and public transport improvements are essential {{in the context of the}} effective pricing policies mentioned earlier.

40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{describe}} sediment sorting where the on-site and off-site effects of soil erosion are studying. There is general agreement among researchers that sediment leaving an area is finer than that of the soil under surface erosion. But in some cases, it has been observed that the coarser particles transported at rates greater than the finer one. This paper describes experiments on different soil types in which the time variation in size distribution of the exiting sediment is measured. The objective was to investigate the processes that control the size distribution of the sediment at the low flow rates. The experiments were carried out on the three soils in the 1 x 6 m flume of Griffith University's large rainfall simulation facility, with overland flow confined to uniform rectangular rills pre-formed in the soil bed. The results supported a selective pattern (<b>bimodal)</b> for <b>transporting</b> of the particles of various size classes, with peaks at the finest class and the size class of 1 - 2 mm. The particles between 0. 1 - 0. 5 mm appeared to resist against transportation. It seems that the presence of different transport mechanisms acting on various size classes (suspension-saltation and rolling) and differences in resistance to transportation (transportability) of various size classes are responsible for selectivity in transportation at the low flow rates...|$|R
