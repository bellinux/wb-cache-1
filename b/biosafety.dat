5|$|Many elite {{research}} {{medical centers}} {{are located in}} Texas. The state has nine medical schools, three dental schools, and two optometry schools. Texas has two <b>Biosafety</b> Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories: one at The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, and the other at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio—the first privately owned BSL-4 lab in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg {{is one of}} only {{a handful}} of <b>biosafety</b> level 4 {{microbiology}} laboratories in the world. The NML houses laboratories of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, in the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease collocated in the same facility. Research facilities are also operated through hospitals and private biotechnology companies in the city.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, K-State {{dedicated}} the Biosecurity Research Institute. The BRI, in Pat Roberts Hall, is a {{safe and}} secure location in which scientists and their collaborators can study high-consequence pathogens. It was designed and constructed for <b>biosafety</b> level 3 (BSL-3) and <b>biosafety</b> level 3 agriculture (BSL-3Ag) research.|$|E
25|$|At {{the lowest}} level of <b>biosafety,</b> {{precautions}} may consist of regular hand-washing and minimal protective equipment. At higher <b>biosafety</b> levels, precautions may include airflow systems, multiple containment rooms, sealed containers, positive pressure personnel suits, established protocols for all procedures, extensive personnel training, and high levels of security to control access to the facility.|$|E
25|$|A <b>biosafety</b> cabinet (BSC)—also {{called a}} {{biological}} safety cabinet or microbiological safety cabinet—is an enclosed, ventilated laboratory workspace for safely working with materials contaminated with (or potentially contaminated with) pathogens requiring a defined <b>biosafety</b> level. Several {{different types of}} BSC exist, differentiated by the degree of biocontainment required. BSCs first became commercially available in 1950.|$|E
25|$|Lugar, {{utilizing}} the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (CTR) which helped former Soviet Union states dismantle {{weapons of mass}} destruction after the Cold War, worked with the country of Georgia on <b>biosafety,</b> biosecurity and biosurveillance efforts through CTR’s Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP). The main goal was to improve the <b>biosafety,</b> biosecurity, disease surveillance, and establish the Central Public Health Reference Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biosafety</b> is the {{prevention}} of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health.|$|E
25|$|A {{laboratory}}-specific <b>biosafety</b> manual must {{be drafted}} which details how the laboratory will operate {{in compliance with}} all safety requirements.|$|E
25|$|In {{laboratories}} where diagnostic {{testing is}} carried out, <b>biosafety</b> level 4-equivalent containment is required. Laboratory researchers must be properly trained in BSL-4 practices and wear proper PPE.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biosafety</b> level 4 (BSL-4) is {{the highest}} level of <b>biosafety</b> precautions, and is {{appropriate}} for work with agents that could easily be aerosol-transmitted within the laboratory and cause severe to fatal disease in humans for which there are no available vaccines or treatments. BSL-4 laboratories are generally set up to be either cabinet laboratories or protective-suit laboratories. In cabinet laboratories, all work must be done within a class III <b>biosafety</b> cabinet. Materials leaving the cabinet must be decontaminated by passing through an autoclave or a tank of disinfectant. The cabinets themselves are required to have seamless edges to allow for easy cleaning. Additionally the cabinet and all materials within must be free of sharp edges {{in order to reduce the}} risk of damage to the gloves. In a protective-suit laboratory, all work must be done in a class II <b>biosafety</b> cabinet by personnel wearing a positive pressure suit. In order to exit the BSL-4 laboratory, personnel must pass through a chemical shower for decontamination, then a room for removing the positive-pressure suit, followed by a personal shower. Entry into the BSL-4 laboratory is restricted to trained and authorized individuals, and all persons entering and exiting the laboratory must be recorded.|$|E
25|$|Four of {{the many}} E. coli strains (K-12, B, C, and W) are thought of as model {{organism}} strains. These are classified in Risk Group 1 in <b>biosafety</b> guidelines.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{sciences}} seek to {{feed the}} world's population while preventing <b>biosafety</b> problems that may affect {{human health and the}} environment. This requires promoting good management of natural resources and respect for the environment, and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system.|$|E
25|$|This {{level of}} <b>biosafety</b> is {{appropriate}} for work with several kinds of microorganisms including non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other organisms not suspected to contribute to human disease. Due to the relative ease and safety of maintaining a BSL-1 laboratory, these are the types of laboratories generally used as teaching spaces for high schools and colleges.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biosafety</b> level 2 is {{suitable}} for work involving agents of moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment. This includes various microbes that cause mild disease to humans, or are difficult to contract via aerosol in a lab setting. Examples include Hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pathogenic Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Plasmodium falciparum, and Toxoplasma gondii.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biosafety</b> level 3 is {{commonly}} used for research and diagnostic work involving various microbes which can be transmitted by aerosols and/or cause severe disease. These include Francisella tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia psittaci, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, SARS coronavirus, Coxiella burnetii, Rift Valley fever virus, Rickettsia rickettsii, several species of Brucella, chikungunya, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus.|$|E
25|$|Texas is home {{to several}} {{research}} medical centers. The state has eight medical schools, three dental schools, and two optometry schools. Texas has two <b>Biosafety</b> Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories: one at The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, and the other at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antoniothe first privately owned BSL-4 lab in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Ebolavirus is {{classified}} as a <b>biosafety</b> level 4 agent, {{as well as a}} Category A bioterrorism agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It {{has the potential to be}} weaponized for use in biological warfare, and was investigated by Biopreparat for such use, but might be difficult to prepare as a weapon of mass destruction because the virus becomes ineffective quickly in open air.|$|E
25|$|Transgenic or genetically {{modified}} organisms, be they bacteria, viruses or fungi, serve {{all kinds of}} research purposes. Transgenic plants, insects, fish and mammals have been bred. Transgenic plants such as corn and soybean have replaced wild strains in agriculture in some countries (e.g. the United States). Transgene escape has been documented for GMO crops since 2001 with persistence and invasiveness. Transgenetic organisms pose ethical questions and may cause <b>biosafety</b> problems.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prototype}} Class III (maximum containment) <b>biosafety</b> cabinet was fashioned in 1943 by Hubert Kaempf Jr., then a U.S. Army soldier, {{under the}} direction of Dr. Arnold G. Wedum, Director (1944–69) of Industrial Health and Safety at the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories, Camp Detrick, Maryland. Kaempf was tired of his MP duties at Detrick and was able to transfer to the sheet metal department working with the contractor, the H.K. Ferguson Co.|$|E
25|$|Sporobolomyces salmonicolor is {{generally}} interpreted to be a <b>Biosafety</b> Risk Group 1 fungus. It {{is considered an}} opportunistic fungal pathogen of immunocompromised individuals and {{has been reported in}} AIDS-related infections. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor has been associated with nasal polyps, lymphadenitis, bone marrow involvement in AIDS patients, infected skin, pseudomeningitis and a case of endophthalmitis. S.salmonicolor is also considered a type 1 allergen and has been known to cause asthma, nosocomial allergic alveolitis, and rhinitis.|$|E
25|$|Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) in {{the genus}} Henipavirus {{have emerged in}} humans and {{livestock}} in Australia and Southeast Asia. Both viruses are contagious, highly virulent, and capable of infecting a number of mammalian species and causing potentially fatal disease. Due {{to the lack of}} a licensed vaccine or antiviral therapies, HeV and NiV are designated as <b>biosafety</b> level (BSL) 4 agents. The genomic structure of both viruses is that of a typical paramyxovirus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biosafety</b> {{cabinets}} {{are used}} {{on a daily basis}} for hours. Besides protection of user and sample material, the human design factors (ergonomics) of the work become more and more important. This includes reduction of the noise level (for a more convenient working atmosphere), a height adjustable stand or stool (for optimized sitting position), panorama side windows (more light within cabinet), 10°angled front sash (enables better sitting position) as well as strong light sources (better view within cabinet) to improve the working conditions.|$|E
25|$|Class II {{cabinets}} {{provide both}} kinds of protection (of the samples and of the environment) since makeup air is also HEPA-filtered. There are five types: Type A1 (formerly A), Type A2 (formerly A/B3), Type B1, Type B2 and Type C1. Each type's requirements are defined by NSF International Standard 49, which in 2002 reclassified A/B3 cabinets (classified under the latter type if connected to an exhaust duct) as Type A2, and added the Type C1 in the 2016 standard. About 90% of all <b>biosafety</b> cabinets installed are Type A2 cabinets.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} Advanced Wind Turbine Test Facility, West Texas A University {{utilizes}} the Killgore Research Center, which houses the Attebury Honors Program, Ronald E. McNair Scholars Program, and the WTAMU Academic and Research Environmental Health and Safety office, to conduct {{state of the}} art research on blood-borne pathogens, <b>biosafety,</b> and occupational health. WTAMU also teams up with several other institutions like the Alternative Energy Institute, Athletic Training Room and Education Laboratory, Computer Information Systems Software and Network Security Testing Lab, Cooperative Research, Education, and Extension Team (CREET), and Dryland Agricultural Institute to conduct research initiatives.|$|E
25|$|On 18 April 1955, {{fourteen}} representatives met at Camp Detrick in Frederick, Maryland. The {{meeting was}} to share knowledge and experiences regarding <b>biosafety,</b> chemical, radiological, and industrial safety {{issues that were}} common to the operations at the three principal biological warfare (BW) laboratories of the U.S. Army. Because of the potential implication of the work conducted at biological warfare laboratories, the conferences were restricted to top level security clearances. Beginning in 1957, these conferences were planned to include non-classified sessions as well as classified sessions to enable broader sharing of biological safety information. It was not until 1964, however, that conferences were held in a government installation not associated with a biological warfare program.|$|E
25|$|People {{who care}} for those {{infected}} with Ebola should wear protective clothing including masks, gloves, gowns and goggles. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend that the protective gear leaves no skin exposed. These measures are also recommended for those who may handle objects contaminated by an infected person's body fluids. In 2014, the CDC began recommending that medical personnel receive training on the proper suit-up and removal of personal protective equipment (PPE); in addition, a designated person, appropriately trained in <b>biosafety,</b> should be watching each step of these procedures to ensure they are done correctly. In Sierra Leone, the typical training period {{for the use of}} such safety equipment lasts approximately 12 days.|$|E
25|$|Genetically {{modified}} organisms (GMO) are organisms whose {{genetic material}} has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance {{are a few}} of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops, which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-GMO crops. Currently a global treaty, the <b>Biosafety</b> Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biosafety</b> level 1 (BSL-1) is {{suitable}} for work with well-characterized agents which do not cause disease in healthy humans. In general, these agents should pose minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. At this level, precautions are limited relative to other levels. Laboratory personnel must wash their hands upon entering and exiting the lab. Research with these agents may be performed on standard open laboratory benches {{without the use of}} special containment equipment. However, eating and drinking are generally prohibited in laboratory areas. Potentially infectious material must be decontaminated before disposal, either by adding an appropriate disinfectant, or by packaging for decontamination elsewhere. Personal protective equipment is only required for circumstances where personnel might be exposed to hazardous material. BSL-1 laboratories must have a door which can be locked to limit access to the lab, however it is not necessary for BSL-1 labs to be isolated from the general building.|$|E
25|$|Sporoidiobolus salmonicolor is a yeast-like fungus in the Basidiomycota more {{commonly}} {{known by the}} name of its asexual yeast-like state, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor. It is generally considered a <b>Biosafety</b> Risk Group 1 fungus; however isolates of S.salmonicolor have been recovered from cerebrospinal fluid, infected skin, a nasal polyp, lymphadenitis and a case of endophthalmitis. It has also been reported in AIDS-related infections. The fungus exists predominantly in the asexual state as a unicellular, haploid yeast yet this species can sometimes produce a sexual state when conjugation of compatible yeast cells occurs. The asexual form consists of a characteristic, pink, ballistosporic yeast. Ballistoconidia are borne from slender extensions of the cell known as sterigma, and are forcibly ejected into the air upon maturity. Levels of airborne yeast cells peak during the night and are abundant in areas of decaying leaves and grains. Three varieties of Sporobolomyces salmonicolor have been described; S.salmonicolor var. albus, S.salmonicolor var. fischerii, and S.salmonicolor var. salmoneus.|$|E

500|$|Though a bio-safety {{regulatory}} system {{was part of}} the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan that [...] "devolved" [...] several functions to the provinces, the system is still unclear with regard to regulators who can oversee the approval of new seed technologies. In this context the three regulatory acts which are under approval stage are the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act, Amendments to the 1976 Seed Act, and the <b>Biosafety</b> Law. According to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service report of 2015, passage of these laws is crucial to the introduction of new biotech events.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>biosafety</b> {{level is}} a set of biocontainment {{precautions}} required to isolate dangerous biological agents in an enclosed laboratory facility. The levels of containment range from the lowest <b>biosafety</b> level 0 (BSL-0) to the highest at level 4 (BSL-4). In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have specified these levels. In the European Union, the same <b>biosafety</b> levels are defined in a directive. In Canada the four levels are known as Containment Levels. Facilities with these designations are also sometimes given as P1 through P4 (for Pathogen or Protection level), as in the term [...] "P3 laboratory".|$|E
