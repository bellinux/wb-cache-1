40|$|The {{effects of}} low doses of alcohol on neural {{synchronization}} in muscular activity were investigated in ten participants during quiet standing with eyes open or closed. We focused {{on changes in}} common input to bilateral motor unit pools as evident in surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings of lower leg extensor and flexor muscles. The extensor muscles exhibited <b>bilateral</b> <b>synchronization</b> in two distinct frequency bands (i. e., 0 - 5 and 10 - 15 Hz), whereas synchronization between flexor muscles was minimal. As expected, alcohol ingestion affected postural sway, yielding increased sway at higher blood-alcohol levels. Whereas vision affected <b>bilateral</b> <b>synchronization</b> only at 0 - 5 Hz, alcohol ingestion resulted in a progressive decrease of synchronization at 10 - 15 Hz between the EMG activities of the extensor muscles. The decrease in common bilateral input is most likely related to reduced reticulospinal activity with alcohol ingestion. Copyright © 2008 The American Physiological Society...|$|E
40|$|Using {{electroencephalography}} (EEG) and electromyography (EMG), corticomuscular and <b>bilateral</b> {{motor unit}} <b>synchronization</b> {{have been found}} in different frequency bands and under different task conditions. These different types of long-range synchrony are hypothesized to originate from distinct mechanisms. We tested this by comparing time-resolved EEG-EMG and EMG-EMG coherence in a bilateral precision-grip task. Bilateral EMG activity was synchronized between 7 and 13 Hz for about 1 s when force output from both hands changed from an increasing to a stable force production. In contrast, EEG-EMG coherence was statistically significant between 15 and 30 Hz during stable force production. The disparities in their time-frequency profiles accord with the existence of distinct underlying processes for corticomuscular and <b>bilateral</b> motor unit <b>synchronization.</b> In addition, the absence of synchronization between cortical activity and common spinal input at 10 Hz renders a cortical source unlikely. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Abstract To {{elucidate}} the neural interactions under-lying bimanual coordination, we investigated in 11 participants the bilateral coupling of homologous muscles in an isometric force production task involv-ing fatiguing elbow Xexion and extension. We focused {{on changes in}} motor unit (MU) synchronization as evident in EMG recordings of relevant muscles. In contrast to a related study on leg muscles, the arm muscles did not exhibit MU synchronization around 16 Hz, consistent with our hypothesis that 16 Hz MU synchronization is linked to balance maintenance. As expected, <b>bilateral</b> MU <b>synchronization</b> was apparent between 8 and 12 Hz and increased with fatigue and more strongly so for extensor than for Xexor muscles. MU synchronization in that frequency band is inter-preted in terms of common bilateral input and sub-stantiates the idea that common input is functionally organized. Since these Wndings {{are consistent with the}} literature on mirror movements, they suggest that both phenomena may be related...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine effects of muscle fatigue on motor-unit synchronization of quadriceps muscles (rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis) within and between legs. We expected muscle fatigue to result in an increased common drive to different motor units of synergists within a leg and, hence, to increased synchronization, i. e., an increased coherence between corresponding surface EMGs. We further expected fatigue-related motor overflow to cause motor-unit synchronization of homologous muscles of both legs, although {{to a lesser extent}} than for synergists within a leg. In the first experiment, different levels of fatigue were induced by varying posture (knee angle), whereas in the second experiment fatigue was induced in a fixed posture by instructing participants to produce different force levels. EMG coherence was found in two distinct frequency bands (6 - 11 and 13 - 18 Hz) and was higher within a leg than between legs. The fatigue-related increase of 6 - 11 Hz inter-limb synchronization resembled the increased motor overflow during unimanual contractions and thus hinted at an increase in <b>bilateral</b> coupling. <b>Synchronization</b> at 13 - 18 Hz was clearly different and appeared to be related to posture. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the synchronization and nonlinear adjustment process of {{short-term interest rates}} for France, the US and the UK using the bi-directional feedback measures proposed by Geweke (1982). and appropriate smooth transition error-correction models (STECM).

Consistently, exogenous shifts in the US rate are found to lead those in France and the UK within a very short time spans from one to two days. Results from nonlinear modeling indicate that short-term interest rates converge towards a common equilibrium in the long-run in a nonlinear manner in that their time dynamics exhibit regime-switching behavior. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} a novel chamber {{in which the}} two intact neonatal rat hippocampi and the commissural fibers are placed in three independent compartments separated by latex membranes and perfused selectively with different solutions. A set of control tests showed that the compartments are well isolated: 1) methylene blue or eosin applied to one compartment did not diffuse to other compartments when verified via the microscope, and spectrophotometry revealed that < 1 / 10. 000 th of the dye diffuses to other compartments; 2) tetrodotoxin (1 microM) applied to the commissural compartment blocked the synaptic responses evoked contralaterally without affecting those evoked on the ipsilateral side. This chamber enables a wide range of experiments that cannot be performed in conventional chambers, e. g., to study the maturation and plasticity of the commissural connections, <b>bilateral</b> <b>synchronization</b> of the rhythmic activities in the limbic system, commissural propagation of the epileptiform activities, etc...|$|E
40|$|The past 30 {{years have}} been witness to an inexorable change in {{the degree to which}} economies are {{connected}} internationally. At the same time, the 2007 - 2008 recession was the first ‘global recession’ in decades. This article explores how international trade and cross-border holdings financial assets impact the synchronization of business cycles internationally. The paper begins by producing chronologies of business cycle turning points for a group of 32 major economies covering 40 years of history. With these chronologies in hand, we document the degree of <b>bilateral</b> business cycle <b>synchronization,</b> relating cross-country differences in <b>synchronization</b> to <b>bilateral</b> trade and financial linkages. The analysis confirms that countries with deep trade linkages tend to experience similar business cycle fluctuations. However, we find no such relationship for financial linkages. ...|$|R
40|$|A subject-specific {{model of}} {{instantaneous}} {{cost of transport}} (ICOT) is introduced from the joint-space formulation of metabolic energy expenditure using the laws of thermodynamics and the principles of multibody system dynamics. Work and heat are formulated in generalized coordinates as functions of joint kinematic and dynamic variables. Generalized heat rates mapped from muscle energetics are estimated from experimental walking metabolic data for the whole body, including upper-body and <b>bilateral</b> data <b>synchronization.</b> Identified subject-specific energetic parameters-mass, height, (estimated) maximum oxygen uptake, and (estimated) maximum joint torques-are incorporated into the heat rate, {{as opposed to the}} traditional in vitro and subject-invariant muscle parameters. The total model metabolic energy expenditure values are within 5. 7 ± 4. 6 % error of the measured values with strong (R 2 > 0. 90) inter- and intra-subject correlations. The model reliably predicts the characteristic convexity and magnitudes (0. 326 - 0. 348) of the experimental total COT (0. 311 - 0. 358) across different subjects and speeds. The ICOT as a function of time provides insights into gait energetic causes and effects (e. g., normalized comparison and sensitivity with respect to walking speed) and phase-specific COT, which are unavailable from conventional metabolic measurements or muscle models. Using the joint-space variables from commonly measured or simulated data, the models enable real-time and phase-specific evaluations of transient or non-periodic general tasks that use a range of (aerobic) energy pathway similar to that of steady-state walking...|$|R
40|$|Cortical {{involvement}} in essential tremor, an involuntary action tremor supposedly of subcortical origin, is uncertain. Conflicting results of corticomuscular coherence studies in essential tremor suggest an intermittent corticomuscular coupling. On {{the basis of}} the literature, we hypothesized that corticomuscular coupling is influenced by <b>bilateral</b> motor <b>synchronization</b> and "cognitive states" such as awareness of tremor. In the present study, we investigated 1) the existence of intermittent corticomuscular coherence (CMC) in essential tremor and 2) factors that influence CMC strength. In 18 essential tremor patients and 18 healthy controls, who mimicked tremor, we simultaneously recorded 64 -channel EEG and 6 -channel bipolar surface EMG from right and left wrist extensors and flexors. Right-sided (mimicked) hand tremor was recorded with and without a cognitive arithmetic task and with left-sided (mimicked) hand tremor. CMC values per task were compared within and between groups. Changes in CMC strength during tasks were calculated. Our main findings are 1) significant CMC around the (mimicked) tremor frequency across all tasks in both groups; 2) significant differences in CMC between unilateral tasks, with the highest values during the cognitive task only in the essential tremor group; and 3) significant fluctuations of CMC strength over time, independent of the tremor intensity, only in the essential tremor group. Our results suggest a limited role, and certainly not a continuous steering role, of sensorimotor cortical neurons in the generation of tremor. In clinical practice, these findings might help to standardize tremor registration and the interpretation of the analysis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The part of the motor cortex involved in essential tremor is uncertain. The current electrophysiological study is the first to assess corticomuscular coherence systematically. The study shows a dynamic nature of corticomuscular coherence and a possible influence of cognitive states. The results elucidate the involvement of the motor cortex in tremor and help interpret the varying results in the literature. In clinical practice, the findings may guide in standardizing tremor registration and its interpretatio...|$|R
40|$|Sniffing and whisking typify the {{exploratory}} behavior of rodents. These actions involve separate oscillators in the medulla, located respectively in the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) and the vibrissa-related {{region of the}} intermediate reticular formation (vIRt). We examine how these oscillators synergize to control sniffing and whisking. We find that the vIRt contains glycinergic/GABAergic cells that rhythmically inhibit vibrissa facial motoneurons. As {{a basis for the}} entrainment of whisking by breathing, but not vice versa, we provide evidence for unidirectional connections from the preBötC to the vIRt. The preBötC further contributes to the control of the mystacial pad. Lastly, we show that bilateral synchrony of whisking relies on the respiratory rhythm, consistent with commissural connections between preBötC cells. These data yield a putative circuit in which the preBötC acts as a master clock for the synchronization of vibrissa, pad, and snout movements, {{as well as for the}} <b>bilateral</b> <b>synchronization</b> of whisking...|$|E
40|$|Despite animal {{evidence}} that the reticulospinal system is of major importance to movement, this motor pathway has remained relatively inaccessible to experimentation in the human. Consequently, {{little is known about}} its function in health and disease. Here, we use the acoustic startle response to demonstrate that one type of reticulospinal activity in the human is associated with a characteristic pattern of <b>bilateral</b> <b>synchronization</b> between motor units. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded from upper limb muscles in 15 healthy subjects during the reflex startle to unexpected acoustic stimulation, voluntary movements mimicking the startle and during sustained voluntary tonic contraction. Frequency analysis demonstrated autospectral peaks at approximately 14 Hz in deltoid and biceps muscles only during the startle reflex. Similarly, coherence spectra of the EMG recorded between homologous proximal upper limb muscles demonstrated a peak centered approximately 12 - 16 Hz during reflex startles. Coherence in the 10 - to 20 -Hz band was significantly greater in the startle reflex than during voluntary sham startles or voluntary tonic contraction for deltoid, but not first dorsal interosseous, muscles. The coherence at 10 - 20 Hz between EMGs from homologous muscles represents a potential surrogate measure of reticulospinal activity that may be useful in determining the contribution of the reticulospinal system to different types of movement in health and disease...|$|E
40|$|Chronic tic {{disorders}} (CTDs) {{are one of}} the relevant problems of pediatric neurology, the higher prevalence of which is associated with undifferentiated therapy without considering comorbidity. Objective: to enhance the efficiency of diagnosis and therapy of {{tic disorders}} in children and adolescents in terms of video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring data. Patients and methods. The investigation enrolled 116 patients, including 83 (71. 6 %) boys and 33 (28. 4 %) girls at the age of 3 to 15 years (mean age, 9. 0 ± 3. 0 years), diagnosed with CTD who had been examined at the Specialized Neurology Department, Voronezh Regional Children's Clinical Hospital One, in the period 2010 – 2014. The investigation consisted of two steps: 1) clinical, laboratory, and neurophysiologic  examination; 2) differentiated therapy. The Yaele Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) was used. The diagnosis was established in accordance with the draft classification of epileptic seizures and epilepsy syndromes by the Intern ational League Against Epilepsy. Video-EEG monitoring was carried out in an awake state and during daytime and/or nighttime sleep. Results and discussion. EEC epileptiform activity was recorded in 46. 6 % of the patients; a concurrence of CTDs and epilepsy was ascertained in 16. 4 % of cases. The risk factors of epilepsy in children with CTDs and EEG epileptiform activity are isolated motor tics in the facial region (p= 0. 0023), MRI epileptogenic changes (p = 0. 01), a remitting course (p= 0. 02), and an early age at the full-scaled picture of tic disorder (p= 0. 02). CTD therapy with antiepileptic drugs (extended-release valproic acid) was effective and safe in both epileptic seizures (remission in 85. 7 % of cases) and tics with an improvement in 81. 5 % of cases with retention in therapy during 2 – 3 years. Therapy with dopamine transmissionlowering drugs was effective against tics; however, their intake for more than 6 months increased a risk for added epileptic seizures in patients with EEG epileptiform activity (the secondary <b>bilateral</b> <b>synchronization</b> phenomenon and epileptic seizures were recorded in 42. 9 and 14. 3 % of the patients, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|Exaggerated {{basal ganglia}} beta {{activity}} (13 - 35 Hz) is {{commonly found in}} patients with Parkinson's disease and can be suppressed by dopaminergic medication, with the degree of suppression being correlated with the improvement in motor symptoms. Importantly, beta activity is not continuously elevated, but fluctuates to give beta bursts. The percentage number of longer beta bursts in a given interval is positively correlated with clinical impairment in Parkinson's disease patients. Here we determine whether the characteristics of beta bursts are dependent on dopaminergic state. Local field potentials were recorded from the subthalamic nucleus of eight Parkinson's disease patients during temporary lead externalization during surgery for deep brain stimulation. The recordings took place with the patient quietly seated following overnight withdrawal of levodopa and after administration of levodopa. Beta bursts were defined by applying a common amplitude threshold and burst characteristics were compared between the two drug conditions. The amplitude of beta bursts, indicative {{of the degree of}} local neural synchronization, progressively increased with burst duration. Treatment with levodopa limited this evolution leading to a relative increase of shorter, lower amplitude bursts. Synchronization, however, was not limited to local neural populations during bursts, but also, when such bursts were cotemporaneous across the hemispheres, was evidenced by <b>bilateral</b> phase <b>synchronization.</b> The probability of beta bursts and the proportion of cotemporaneous bursts were reduced by levodopa. The percentage number of longer beta bursts in a given interval was positively related to motor impairment, while the opposite was true for the percentage number of short duration beta bursts. Importantly, the decrease in burst duration was also correlated with the motor improvement. In conclusion, we demonstrate that long duration beta bursts are associated with an increase in local and interhemispheric synchronization. This may compromise information coding capacity and thereby motor processing. Dopaminergic activity limits this uncontrolled beta synchronization by terminating long duration beta bursts, with positive consequences on network state and motor symptoms...|$|R
