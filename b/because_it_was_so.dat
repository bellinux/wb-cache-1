5|$|It {{is likely}} that Bede's work, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> widely copied, {{discouraged}} others from writing histories and may even {{have led to the}} disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of filming for a {{computer}} game, certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, Lee and Bailey, had never done any blue screen acting before, and Miano had only done it once. Morsell in particular said she found it challenging <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> physically constrictive. Such items as tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with. During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood {{in such a way that}} his arm appeared to be going through the living room wall.|$|E
5|$|Legislators found {{themselves}} in an unusual and uncomfortable situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, {{and the nature of}} nuclear energy was not widely understood. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> new, there were no policies or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military.|$|E

5|$|HAT-P-33 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.89. <b>It</b> cannot <b>be</b> seen from Earth {{with the naked}} eye <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> dim.|$|R
5|$|Unlike the Great Sand Sea, {{the coastal}} {{portion of the}} Libyan Desert is stony rather than sandy, {{but it is no}} less arid, and {{supports}} little vegetation. Close to the coast, the ground was broken by wadis. Military vehicles could traverse the stony desert with little difficulty, although the heat, dust and wind caused their rapid deterioration. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> thinly populated, bombs and shells could be used with minimal risk of civilian casualties. Winter nights could be bitterly cold, yet the days could still be uncomfortably hot. There was almost no food or water, and little shelter from the cold, the heat or the wind. The desert was, however, relatively free from disease.|$|E
25|$|I stopped {{after two}} {{chapters}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> boring,...It {{is really quite}} a bad book. I asked Ed Neumeier {{to tell me the}} story because I just couldn't read the thing. It's a very right-wing book.|$|E
25|$|In December, she {{released}} her Cantonese album Di-Dar which mixes an alternative yodelling style {{with a touch}} of Indian and Middle Eastern flavour. This album was a success, partly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> different from the mainstream Cantopop music, but—ironically—a couple of very traditional romantic songs topped the charts.|$|E
5000|$|The pink ribbon is the {{international}} symbol of breast cancer awareness. Pink <b>was</b> chosen partially <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> strongly associated with femininity.|$|R

25|$|In June 1927, the new airmail {{contractor}} for {{the federal}} government refused to use Hoover Field any longer <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> unsafe. Airmail service was transferred to nearby Bolling Field, a military airport. Hoover Field's location—bordered by highways, rivers, and federally owned land—also prevented its expansion to accommodate newer aircraft requiring longer runways.|$|E
25|$|TNT {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1863 by German chemist Julius Wilbrand and originally {{used as a}} yellow dye. Its potential as an explosive was not appreciated for several years, mainly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> difficult to detonate {{and because it was}} less powerful than alternatives. Its explosive properties were first discovered by another German chemist, Carl Häussermann, in 1891. TNT can be safely poured when liquid into shell cases, and is so insensitive that it was exempted from the UK's Explosives Act 1875 and was not considered an explosive for the purposes of manufacture and storage.|$|E
25|$|Leopold also {{approved}} and collaborated {{on the development}} of a political constitution, said to have anticipated by many years the promulgation of the French constitution and which presented some similarities with the Virginia Bill of Rights of 1778. Leopold's concept of this was based on respect for the political rights of citizens and on a harmony of power between the executive and the legislative. However, it could not be put into effect because Leopold moved to Vienna to become emperor in 1790, and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> radically new that it garnered opposition even from those who might have benefited from it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} year, 400 beer houses opened and within eight years there were 46,000 across the country, far outnumbering the {{combined}} total of long-established taverns, pubs, inns and hotels. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> easy to obtain permission and the profits could be huge {{compared to the}} low cost of gaining permission, the number of beer houses was continuing to rise and in some towns nearly every other house in a street could be a beer house. Finally in 1869 the growth had to be checked by magisterial control and new licensing laws were introduced. Only then was it made harder to get a licence, and the licensing laws which operate today were formulated.|$|E
25|$|Although the show's {{writers and}} {{producers}} received a minimal negative reaction from Willow choosing Tara over Oz, {{the response from}} viewers and critics alike was overwhelming towards Whedon for killing Tara, accusing him of homophobia. Particularly because Tara's death came {{at a point where}} Willow and Tara had reconciled and were shown following an apparent sexual encounter, the writers were criticized for representing the consequences of lesbian sex as punishable by death. Series writer and producer Marti Noxon—whose mother fell in love with another woman when Noxon was 13 years old—was unable to read some of the mail the writing team received <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> upsetting. To her, the pain expressed in viewers' letters was a logical reaction to the lack of realistic lesbian role models on television.|$|E
25|$|The mitrailleuse's {{dependence}} on manual loading meant that its firing rate depended greatly on {{the skill of}} its operators. A skillfully manned Reffye mitrailleuse could sustain four volleys (100 rounds) per minute in ordinary operation and reach five volleys (125 rounds) per minute during emergencies. The rapidity of discharge of each individual volley (25 rounds) was controlled by the gunner's action on a small manual crank {{on the right side}} of the breech. In other words, the weapon's 25 barrels were not discharged all at once but in rapid succession. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> heavy (1,500lbs), the Reffye mitrailleuse did not recoil during firing and thus did not need to be re-sighted on its target after each volley. This absence of recoil during firings was promoted by Reffye as a considerable advantage over conventional field artillery. Each regular battery of Reffye mitrailleuses lined up six guns firing together, more or less side by side.|$|E

25|$|There {{were many}} heros {{throughout}} the exhausting {{five days of}} play, but with a doubt, the most unsung of them was Greg Matthews, who scored 44 and 27 not out and took five wickets in each innings. His stamina and resilience were absolutely staggering, especially on the last day, when he bowled 39.5 overs just about consecutively to keep us {{in the game and}} then ultimately tie it. Making his feat all the more noteworthy in the eyes of his fellow players was the fact that he wore two sleeveless sweaters throughout the day. Actually, he gave one to the umpire when he fielded and only wore them both when he was bowling. We just shook our heads in disbelief, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> hot with 90 degree humidity, but as usual Greg had a theory. He explained that nomadic herders in the desert wore woollen coats because they kept the cool air in, thus acting as a kind of air-conditioner.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Drummond admitted: [...] "We didn't {{listen to}} 1987 What The Fuck's Going On {{for a long}} time, and when we did we were embarrassed by it <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> badly recorded. But I still felt {{we were able to}} get a lot out of {{ourselves}} through it." ...|$|E
500|$|Audiogram {{finished}} La Llorona {{in early}} 1997 with Desrosiers producing, arranging and accompanying. The Spanish-language album mixed 1930s and 1940s-era Latin American songs with original songs; it was {{strongly influenced by}} Mexican music but also by klezmer, torch songs, gypsy jazz and Middle Eastern music. Even though she did not consider herself fluent in Spanish, Lhasa said that she enjoyed singing in the language because it came from [...] "a deeper place". Wolff said that he expected the album to be marketed to people other than Spanish speakers <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> different from contemporary Hispanic music.|$|E

50|$|The nitride ion, N3−, {{is never}} {{encountered}} in protic solution <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> basic that <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> protonated immediately. <b>Its</b> ionic radius <b>is</b> {{estimated to be}} 140 pm.|$|R
500|$|Baby Gerald, Luigi Risotto, Assistant Superintendent Leopold, and Flanders' parents {{make their}} first {{appearances}} {{on the show}} in this episode. Leopold and Luigi were designed by David Silverman, one of the show's directors. Anderson thought Luigi {{was one of the}} funniest characters on the show when he first read Luigi's lines in the script during a table read of the episode. When Anderson skimmed through the script and saw Luigi's lines, he said he [...] "frightened Julie Kavner because I was laughing to myself, but trying to keep the laughter in <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> damn funny." ...|$|E
500|$|Two live {{versions}} of the song recorded during Dylan's 1966 tour of England have been released. His performance of the song at London's Royal Albert Hall on May 26, 1966 appeared on Biograph, released in 1985. Asked by Cameron Crowe, for the liner notes for Biograph, how he could remember the words of such a complex song in live performance, Dylan responded, [...] "I could remember a song without writing it down <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> visual." [...] A performance of the song recorded at the Manchester Free Trade Hall on May 17, 1966 was released on [...] in 1998.|$|E
500|$|As {{the first}} second-generation {{battleship}} in the US Navy, Nevada {{has been described}} as [...] "revolutionary" [...] and [...] "as radical as [...] was in her day" [...] by present-day historians. At the time of its completion in 1916, The New York Times remarked that the new warship was [...] "the greatest [...] afloat" [...] <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> much larger than other contemporary American battleships: its tonnage was nearly three times that of the obsolete 1890 pre-dreadnought , almost twice that of the 1904 battleship , and almost [...] greater than that of one of the first American dreadnoughts, —built just seven years prior to Nevada.|$|E
