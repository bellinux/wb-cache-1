500|$|In October 2016, Marvel {{confirmed}} that main cast members Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Ming-Na Wen as Melinda May, Chloe Bennet as Daisy Johnson / Quake, Iain De Caestecker as Leo Fitz, Elizabeth Henstridge as Jemma Simmons, Henry Simmons as Alphonso [...] "Mack" [...] MacKenzie, and John Hannah as Holden Radcliffe would be {{starring in the}} episode. Following the airing of the previous episode, executive producer Jed Whedon teased that [...] "Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire" [...] would explore the dynamic between Luna's Ghost Rider, Robbie Reyes, and Elias Morrow, his uncle, but would be [...] "pivoting from the storyline in the comics. We’re pulling the characters, the character names and the relationships, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can already feel that we’ve changed it. Those dynamics will be entirely different. We’re using them as inspiration." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con it was {{revealed}} that the series would be adapting the character of Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider during its fourth season, with the first eight episodes making up the opening [...] "pod" [...] of episodes for the season, subtitled Ghost Rider. That October, executive producer Jed Whedon said that the series' use of Reyes and his supporting characters and mythology was [...] "definitely pivoting from the storyline in the comics. We’re pulling the characters, the character names and the relationships, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can already feel that we’ve changed it. Those dynamics will be entirely different. We’re using them as inspiration." [...] Marvel soon revealed that the sixth episode of the season would be titled [...] "The Good Samaritan", and would tell the series' version of Reyes' origin story. It is written by executive producer Jeffrey Bell, with Billy Gierhart directing.|$|E
500|$|On {{the issue}} of whether {{competitive}} curlers would be offended by the episode, LaZebnik said [...] "When you hear The Simpsons is going to do their take on your sport, you naturally get a little alarmed, But we ended up being respectful I would say, even, surprisingly respectful. Both Homer and Marge take it seriously." [...] Some curlers, including the Clarks and Patzke, felt that the exposure the sport received was beneficial. Cristin Clark said [...] "Although Homer Simpson probably isn't the ideal athlete I would want to see representing our sport, I just think it's great exposure." [...] Canadian curler Randy Ferbey, a four-time world champion, said [...] "I'm sure they're going to somehow make a mockery of it like they do every other thing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> need to take it with a grain of salt. It brings attention to our sport and I think it's wonderful. The more curling on TV, whether it's in an animated form or real form, the better." ...|$|E

500|$|The tale was {{the basis}} for a story in The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith, wherein the prince decides to slip a bowling ball {{underneath}} one hundred mattresses after three years of unsuccessful attempts with the pea. In the morning, the princess comes downstairs and tells the queen, [...] "This might sound odd, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> need another mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a lump as big as a bowling ball." [...] which satisfies the king and the queen. The princess gets married to the prince, and they live happily, though maybe not completely honestly, ever after. American poet Jane Shore published a poem, [...] "The Princess and the Pea", in the January 1973 issue of Poetry, in which a close dependency between princess and pea is posited: [...] "I lie in my skin as in an ugly coat: / my body owned by the citizens / who ache and turn whenever I turn / on the pea on which so much depends" [...] (13-16). Russian writer Evgeny Shvarts incorporates the story, with two other Andersen stories, in his Naked King.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, after Pearl Jam's 2006 tour had ended, {{the band}} members began {{recording}} demo material on their own while staying in occasional contact via e-mail. Guitarist Mike McCready revealed {{at the time that}} he had tested out some ideas with guitarist Stone Gossard and drummer Matt Cameron in separate sessions as well. After the band was invited to record The Who's [...] "Love, Reign o'er Me" [...] for the Reign Over Me soundtrack, they opted to call long-time collaborator Brendan O'Brien to produce their cover. During the experience, O'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was a good time for them to work again in a studio album. This ninth album would mark O'Brien's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998's Yield. The band allowed O'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer. [...] "At this point, I think we're willing to let somebody cut the songs up a little bit," [...] says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder. [...] "In the past, Brendan would say, 'It's a great song, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> should do it in a different key', and we'd say no. But now that we've heard Bruce [...] has listened to his suggestions, I think we will too." [...] Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "He brings a brutally honest approach to what he thinks is working and what isn't, and it really moves things along... We don't get weighted down with ideas that maybe aren't even that good. He's one of the few people outside of the band that we trust with our music, and we're really, really looking forward to making this record." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to a 2006 Newsweek interview, [...] "For Graham, {{politics}} is a secondary to the Gospel.... When Newsweek asked Graham whether ministers—whether they {{think of themselves as}} evangelists, pastors or a bit of both—should spend time engaged with politics, he replied: 'You know, I think in a way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the Lord. A lot of things that I commented on years ago would not have been of the Lord, I'm sure, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have some—like communism, or segregation, on which I think you have a responsibility to speak out.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|According to some critics, Sparks was {{inspired}} by the 1992 best-selling novel The Bridges of Madison County in writing Nights in Rodanthe. The Bridges of Madison County has a few similarities to Nights in Rodanthe: the characters are roughly of the same age and their relationships had ended. Sparks, said he was more guided by his novel The Notebook than The Bridges. He explained that the latter is a story of adultery while his is not. The main male character of The Bridges was a loner without children, while Paul has children. In his official website, Sparks writes, [...] "The list [...] could go on and on, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> get the point." ...|$|E

If the Marine as a fighting man has not made a case for himself after 170 years of service, he must go. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will agree with me that he has earned the right to depart with dignity and honor, not by subjugation to the status of uselessness and servility planned for him by the War Department." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the years}} EastEnders has {{typically}} featured {{a number of}} elderly residents, {{who are used to}} show vulnerability, nostalgia, stalwart-like attributes and are sometimes used for comedic purposes. The original elderly residents included Lou Beale, Ethel Skinner and Dot Cotton. Over the years they have been joined by the likes of Mo Butcher, Jules Tavernier, Marge Green, Nellie Ellis, Jim Branning, Charlie Slater, Mo Harris, Patrick Trueman, Cora Cross, Les Coker, Rose Cotton, Pam Coker, Stan Carter, Babe Smith, Claudette Hubbard, Sylvie Carter, Ted Murray and Joyce Murray. Focus on elderly characters has decreased since the show's inception. The programme has more recently included a higher number of teenagers and successful young adults in a bid to capture the younger television audience. This has spurred criticism, most notably from the actress Anna Wing, who played Lou Beale in the show. She commented, [...] "I don't want to be disloyal, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> need a few mature people in a soap because they give it backbone and body... if all the main people are young it gets a bit thin and inexperienced. It gets too lightweight." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jim Schembri in The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age (Melbourne) wrote, [...] "The film is fine, {{and never}} boring but, boy, is it overlong," [...] and added, [...] "More importantly, local films with black themes or major {{indigenous}} characters {{tend to do}} poorly, so if Australia succeeds here it could represent a breakthrough. We've always had trouble dealing with racial issues on film, so, in that regard, the film could be a landmark." [...] Claire Sutherland, in her review for the Herald Sun (Melbourne) wrote, [...] "A love letter to the Australian landscape and our history, Australia has international blockbuster written all over it", and Sydney's The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Kidman's screen presence {{is nothing short of}} radiant." [...] In his review for The Australian (Sydney), David Stratton wrote, [...] "It's not the masterpiece that we were hoping for, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> could say that it's a very good film in many ways. While it will be very popular with many people I think there's a slight air of disappointment after it all. Despite its flaws — and it certainly has flaws — I think Australia is an impressive and important film." [...] Mark Naglazas of The West Australian (Perth) accused positive reviews from News Ltd press outlets of being manipulated by 20th Century Fox, as they are all owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, calling Australia a film of [...] "unrelenting awfulness" [...] that [...] "lurches drunkenly from crazy comedy to Mills and Boonish melodrama {{in the space of a}} couple of scenes".|$|E
