60|$|When {{the storm}} was brewing she was {{not far from the}} Downs, but the <b>baffling</b> <b>winds</b> retarded her progress, and it was pitch dark when she reached the {{neighbourhood}} of the Goodwin sands.

60|$|Another week {{of light}} <b>baffling</b> <b>winds,</b> {{and then the}} breeze died away {{altogether}} {{and there was a}} dead calm. The sun poured down with great force, but the sky was less blue and clear than usual. At night it was stiflingly hot, and the next morning the sun again rose over a sea as smooth as a sheet of glass.|$|R
6000|$|JULY 10. Spoke a brig from Rio, {{bound to}} Norfolk. Weather hazy, {{with a light}} <b>baffling</b> <b>wind</b> from the eastward. To-day Hartman Rogers died, having been {{attacked}} on the eighth with spasms after drinking a glass of grog. This man was of the cook's party, and one upon whom Peters placed his main reliance. He told Augustus that he believed the mate had poisoned him, and that he expected, {{if he did not}} be on the look-out, his own turn would come shortly. There were now only himself, Jones, and the cook belonging to his own gang--on the other side there were five. He had spoken to Jones about taking the command from the mate; but the project having been coolly received, he had been deterred from pressing the matter any further, or from saying any thing to the cook. It was well, as it happened, that he was so prudent, for in the afternoon the cook expressed his determination of siding with the mate, and went over formally to that party; while Jones took an opportunity of quarrelling with Peters, and hinted that he would let the mate know of the plan in agitation. There was now, evidently, no time to be lost, and Peters expressed his determination of attempting to take the vessel at all hazards, provided Augustus would lend him his aid. My friend at once assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that purpose, and, thinking the opportunity a favourable one, made known the fact of my being on board. At this the hybrid was not more astonished than delighted, as he had no reliance whatever upon Jones, whom he already considered as belonging to the party of the mate. They went below immediately, when Augustus called to me by name, and Peters and myself were soon made acquainted. It was agreed that we should attempt to retake the vessel upon the first good opportunity, leaving Jones altogether out of our councils. In the event of success, we were to run the brig into the first port that offered, and deliver her up. The desertion of his party had frustrated Peters' design of going into the Pacific--an adventure which could not be accomplished without a crew, and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial, on the score of insanity (which he solemnly avowed had actuated him in lending his aid to the mutiny), or upon obtaining a pardon, if found guilty, through the representations of Augustus and myself. Our deliberations were interrupted for the present by the cry of, [...] "All hands take in sail," [...] and Peters and Augustus ran up on deck.|$|E
60|$|He {{no longer}} sailed against <b>baffling</b> <b>winds,</b> but went quite contentedly in any {{direction}} in which the wind chose to blow him. The consequence was that he visited many curious out-of-the-way places, and saw many strange sights; besides having {{a considerable number of}} peculiar adventures. The week following that in which he first saw the sun all night was particularly full of small adventures. Let me briefly relate a few.|$|R
60|$|The sequel is soon told. After a long passage, vexed by calms and <b>baffling</b> <b>winds,</b> we {{made the}} little port of Tombez in Peru, there to recruit the ship. Payta was not very distant. Our captain sold the {{tortoise}} oil to a Tombez merchant; and adding to the silver a contribution from all hands, gave it to our silent passenger, who knew not what the mariners had done.|$|R
6000|$|Calms and <b>baffling</b> <b>winds</b> {{made the}} return to this island trying and difficult, and Mota was not reached till the 4th of October. George Sarawia was still {{perfectly}} satisfactory; and his community, on the whole, going on hopefully. Want of provisions, which Mota could not supply, made the stay very brief; and after obtaining the necessary supplies at Aurora, the 'Southern Cross' brought her sad tidings to Norfolk Island on the 17th. That day Mrs. Palmer wrote:-- ...|$|R
60|$|There was no slight {{amount of}} work to be done before the little party could be ready to abandon the Sea Bird. The journey to Nassau might be a long one because of <b>baffling</b> <b>winds,</b> and plenty of food must be cooked. There were no kegs or small casks aboard, {{consequently}} it would be necessary to fill all the bottles and cans with water; and, in addition, Bob and Joe would be occupied a greater portion of the day in rigging the yawl.|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} the breeze was blowing strong. The sails had been taken off the mainmast, but that on the {{foremast}} was dragging the Lido through the water at a good rate of speed, and before night they were off Cape Spartivento. The wind held till next morning, when they were abreast of the Gulf of Taranto. Then came a long spell of calms or <b>baffling</b> <b>winds,</b> {{and it was a}} fortnight before the campaniles of Venice were seen rising apparently from the water.|$|R
60|$|We were {{so short}} of men {{that every one}} on board had to bear a hand--only the captain lying on a {{mattress}} in the stern and giving his orders; for, though greatly recovered, {{he was still in}} want of quiet. We laid her head for the nearest port in Spanish America, for we could not risk the voyage home without fresh hands; and as it was, what with <b>baffling</b> <b>winds</b> and a couple of fresh gales, we were all worn out before we reached it.|$|R

Moreover, the weather was extraordinarily unfavourable--damp, foul winds, squalls, calms, unhealthy weather. Mr. Tilly was being greatly pulled down, and everything seemed {{to point out that}} the voyage ought not to be long. I made my mind up, took back the Solomon Island scholars; and, with heavy sea and <b>baffling</b> <b>winds</b> and one short gale, sailed back to New Zealand.|$|R
60|$|The lake {{gradually}} {{grew more}} tranquil as we proceeded north, and from Lausanne to Vévey {{we actually had}} smooth water. I saw vessels becalmed, or with <b>baffling</b> <b>winds,</b> under this shore, while the bise was blowing stiff, a few leagues farther down the lake. When I got home I was {{surprised to hear that}} the family had been boating the previous evening, and that there had scarcely been any wind during the day. This difference was owing to the sheltered position of Vévey, of which the fact may serve to give you a better notion than a more laboured description.|$|R

I have brought a chart on board with me. Our course is north-north-east, and the distance is between two and three hundred miles. In any decent part of the world we should do it in a couple of days, but with these <b>baffling</b> <b>winds</b> we may take a week or more. Well, I don’t much care how long we are; it will be a luxury to be one’s own master for a bit.” ...|$|R
60|$|While Clay traced her {{movements}} {{as far as}} they could be learned, the Cetacea was slowly working north. She met with light, <b>baffling</b> <b>winds,</b> and calms, and then was driven into a lonely inlet by a fresh gale. Here she was detained for some time, and adverse winds still dogged her course when she put to sea again, though they were no longer gentle, but brought with them a piercing rawness from the Polar ice. Her crew grew anxious and moody as they stubbornly thrashed her to windward under shortened sail, for every day at sea increased the strain on their finances and the open-water season was short.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{will come}} again or, {{if you want}} me before that, send for me," [...] and the first mate went out on deck again, for though well skilled to handle a ship in all weathers, and as brave and hardy a seaman as sailed out of Plymouth, James Standing could neither read nor write; and though in a rough sort of way he could reckon the course a ship should lie, and make {{allowance}} for leeway and currents and <b>baffling</b> <b>winds,</b> and could bring a ship into any port in England or the Low Countries, he was of no use in a matter of this kind.|$|R
60|$|This, indeed, was {{a moment}} when the {{feelings}} of the people appeared to be as variable as the light and <b>baffling</b> <b>winds</b> themselves. The Saturday passed away in the manner just mentioned, the vessels once more entering into large fields of weeds, just as the sun set. When the light returned, the airs headed them off to north-west and north-west-by-north, by compass, which was, in truth, steering north-west-by-west-half-west, and north-west-half-west. Birds abounded again, among which was a turtle-dove, and many living crabs were seen crawling among the weeds. All these signs would have encouraged the common men, had they not already so often proved deceptive.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, what a long dreary {{time that}} was! Light <b>baffling</b> <b>winds</b> continually, and we in a vessel as {{different}} from the [...] "Southern Cross" [...] as possible, absolutely guiltless, I should think, of having ever made two miles an hour to windward [...] "in a wind." [...] The one thing that stands out as having relieved its dreariness {{is the presence of}} Mr. Patteson, the visits he used to pay to us, and the exquisite pathos of his voice as, from the corner of the hold where we lay, we could hear him reading the Morning and Evening Prayers of the Church and leading the hymn. These prevented these long weary wakeful days and nights from being absolutely insupportable.' ...|$|R

60|$|This {{resolution}} was characteristic. Even with a competent pilot, Papeetee Bay, {{is considered a}} ticklish, one to enter. Formed by a bold sweep of the shore, it is protected seaward by the coral reef, upon which the rollers break with great violence. After stretching across the bay, the barrier extends on toward Point Venus, {{in the district of}} Matavia, eight or nine miles distant. Here there is an opening, by which ships enter, and glide down the smooth, deep canal, between the reef and the shore, to the harbour. But, by seamen generally, the leeward entrance is preferred, as the wind is extremely variable inside the reef. This latter entrance is a break in the barrier directly facing the bay and village of Papeetee. It is very narrow; and from the <b>baffling</b> <b>winds,</b> currents, and sunken rocks, ships now and then grate their keels against the coral.|$|R

60|$|That {{night and}} next day, light and <b>baffling</b> <b>winds</b> and but little progress. Hard to bear, that {{persistent}} standing still, {{and the food}} wasting away. 'Everything in a perfect sop; and all so cramped, and no change of clothes.' Soon the sun comes out and roasts them. 'Joe caught another dolphin to-day; in his maw we found a flying-fish and two skipjacks.' There is an event, now, which rouses an enthusiasm of hope: a land-bird arrives! It rests on the yard for awhile, and they {{can look at it}} all they like, and envy it, and thank it for its message. As a subject of talk it is beyond price--a fresh new topic for tongues tired to death of talking upon a single theme: Shall we ever see the land again; and when? Is the bird from Clipperton Rock? They hope so; and they take heart of grace to believe so. As it turned out the bird had no message; it merely came to mock.|$|R

60|$|On {{the face}} of things, I ought to say, loyalty {{appeared}} unshaken. When the schooner at last returned for us, after much experience of <b>baffling</b> <b>winds,</b> she brought a rumour that Tebureimoa had declared war on Apemama. Tembinok' became a new man; his face radiant; his attitude, as I saw him preside over a council of chiefs {{in one of the}} palace maniap's, eager as a boy's; his voice sounding abroad shrill and jubilant, over half the compound. War is what he wants, and here was his chance. The English captain, when he flung his arms in the lagoon, had forbidden him (except in one case) all military adventures in the future: here was the case arrived. All morning the council sat; men were drilled, arms were bought, the sound of firing disturbed the afternoon; the king devised and communicated to me his plan of campaign, which was highly elaborate and ingenious, but perhaps a trifle fine-spun for the rough and random vicissitudes of war. And in all this bustle the temper of the people appeared excellent, an unwonted animation in every face, and even Uncle Parker burning with military zeal.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it {{depended}} on me--on either of us--they should distress you no more. The boat is slowly entering the inlet, but has {{to struggle with}} a head-tide. The <b>wind</b> <b>baffles,</b> and is light, or in ten minutes we should be out of danger." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} day the <b>wind</b> <b>baffled,</b> {{for the first}} time since encountering the trades; and the clouds collected over-head, dispersing drizzling showers on the navigators. The vessels now lay near each other, and conversation flew from one to the other--boats passing and repassing, constantly.|$|R
60|$|The {{fact was}} too true to be denied, for the brigand tine was again under all her canvas, before {{the ship had}} sensibly profited by her {{superior}} physical force. It was at this moment, when, perhaps, in consequence of the swell on the water, the Coquette might have possessed some small advantage, that the wind suddenly failed. The squall had been its expiring effort; and, within {{an hour after the}} two vessels had again made sail, the canvas was flapping against the masts, in a manner to throw back, in eddies, a force as great as that it received. The sea fell fast, and ere {{the end of the last}} or forenoon watch, the surface of the ocean was agitated only by those long undulating swells, that seldom leave it entirely without motion. For some little time, there were fickle currents of air playing in various directions about the ship, but always in sufficient force to urge her slowly through the water; and then, when the equilibrium of the element seemed established, there was a total calm. During the half-hour of the <b>baffling</b> <b>winds,</b> the brigantine had been a gainer, though not enough to carry her entirely beyond the reach of the cruiser's guns.|$|R
50|$|Five shorter {{tapestries}} depict colorful plant ornaments. The tapestries {{were brought}} into the parlour of the Town Hall only in very solemn cases.

60|$|The {{northwest}} monsoon was blowing, {{and they}} fled {{south in the}} night time, hiding by day on detached and uninhabited islets, or dragging their whale boat into the bush on the large islands. Thus they gained Guadalcanar, skirted halfway along it, and crossed the Indispensable Straits to Florida Island. It was here that they killed the San Cristoval boy, saving his head and cooking and eating the rest of him. The Malaita coast was only twenty miles away, but the last night a strong current and <b>baffling</b> <b>winds</b> prevented them from gaining across. Daylight found them still several miles from their goal. But daylight brought a cutter, in which were two white men, who were not afraid of eleven Malaita men armed with twelve rifles. Mauki and his companions were carried back to Tulagi, where lived the great white master of all the white men. And the great white master held a court, after which, one by one, the runaways were tied up and given twenty lashes each, and sentenced to a fine of fifteen dollars. They were sent back to New Georgia, where the white men knocked seven bells out of them all around and put them to work. But Mauki was no longer house-boy. He was put in the road-making gang. The fine of fifteen dollars had been paid by the white men from whom he had run away, and {{he was told that}} he would have to work it out, which meant six months' additional toil. Further, his share of the stolen tobacco earned him another year of toil.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} of the day on which they saw the last of Vancouver Island, Jimmy sat in the Cetacea’s cockpit with a chart of the North Pacific spread out before him on the cabin hatch. It showed the tortuous straits, thickly {{sprinkled}} with islands of all sizes, through which they had somehow threaded their way during the last week, in spite of <b>baffling</b> head <b>winds</b> and racing tides, and though Jimmy was a navigator he felt some surprise at their having accomplished the feat without touching bottom. Now he had their course to the north plotted out along the deeply fretted coast of British Columbia, and rolling up the chart he rose to look about.|$|R
