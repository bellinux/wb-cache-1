25|$|The binding of the N-acetyl {{group is}} more complex and less known. The {{important}} amino acids in the <b>binding</b> <b>pocket</b> for this group differ between the two receptors. Serines, Ser110 and Ser114, in the TM3 domain seem to be important for binding to the MT1 receptor. However, aspargine 175 (Asn) in the TM4 domain {{is likely to be}} important for the MT2 receptor. The aromatic ring system in melatonin and analogues most likely contributes some binding affinity by binding to aromatic rings of the amino acids phenylalanine (Phe) and tryptophan (Trp) in the receptor. The bonds that form are van der Waals interactions. The N-acetyl binding and <b>binding</b> <b>pocket,</b> binding of the ring system and important domains are somewhat known and need further investigation.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Identification of ligand <b>binding</b> <b>pockets</b> on {{proteins}} {{are crucial}} for the characterization of protein functions. It provides valuable information for protein-ligand docking and rational engineering of small molecules that regulate protein functions. A major number of current prediction algorithms of ligand <b>binding</b> <b>pockets</b> are based on cubic grid representation of proteins and thus the results are often protein orientation dependent. Results: We present MSPocket program for detecting pockets on the solvent excluded surface of proteins. The core algorithm of the MSPocket approach does not use any cubic grid system to represent proteins and is therefore independent of protein orientations. We demonstrate that MSPocket is able to achieve an accuracy of 75 % in predicting ligand <b>binding</b> <b>pockets</b> on a test dataset used for evaluating several existing methods. The accuracy is 92 % if the top three predictions are considered. Comparison {{to one of the}} recently published best performing methods shows that MSPocket reaches similar performance with the additional feature of being protein orientation independent. Interestingly, some of the predictions are different, meaning that the two methods can be considered complementary and combined to achieve better prediction accuracy. MSPocket also provides a graphical user interface for interactive investigation of the predicted ligand <b>binding</b> <b>pockets.</b> In addition, we show that overlap criterion is a better strategy for the evaluation of predicted ligand <b>binding</b> <b>pockets</b> than the single point distance criterion.

25|$|Through {{methods such as}} X-ray {{crystallography}} and NMR spectroscopy, {{the information}} about 3D structures of target molecules has increased dramatically, and so has structural information about the ligands. This drives rapid development of structure-based drug design. Some of these new drugs target membrane receptors. Current approaches to structure-based drug design {{can be divided into}} two categories. The first category is about determining ligands for a given receptor. This is usually accomplished through database queries, biophysical simulations, and the construction of chemical libraries. In each case, a large number of potential ligand molecules are screened to find those fitting the <b>binding</b> <b>pocket</b> of the receptor. This approach is usually referred to as ligand-based drug design. The key advantage of searching a database is that it saves time and power to obtain new effective compounds. Another approach of structure-based drug design is about combinatorially mapping ligands, which is referred to as receptor-based drug design. In this case, ligand molecules are engineered within the constraints of a <b>binding</b> <b>pocket</b> by assembling small pieces in a stepwise manner. These pieces can be either atoms or molecules. The key advantage of such a method is that novel structures can be discovered.|$|E

25|$|Crystallisation {{experiments}} of galectins {{in complex}} with N-acetyllactosamine show that binding arises due to hydrogen bonding interactions from the carbon-4 and carbon-6 hydroxyl groups of galactose and carbon-3 of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) {{to the side}} chains of amino acids in the protein. They cannot bind to other sugars such as mannose because this sugar will not fit inside the carbohydrate recognition domain without steric hindrance. Due {{to the nature of}} the <b>binding</b> <b>pocket,</b> galectins can bind terminal sugars or internal sugars within a glycan. This allows bridging between two ligands on the same cell or between two ligands on different cells.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of receptors with known structures, transmembrane alpha helices constitute most of the transmembrane component. In certain receptors, such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the transmembrane domain forms a protein pore through the membrane, or around the ion channel. Upon activation of an extracellular domain by binding of the appropriate ligand, the pore becomes accessible to ions, which then diffuse. In other receptors, the transmembrane domains undergo a conformational change upon binding, which effects intracellular conditions. In some receptors, such {{as members of the}} 7TM superfamily, the transmembrane domain includes a ligand <b>binding</b> <b>pocket.</b> Bacteriorhodopsin is an example, the detailed structure of which has been determined by crystallography.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} ATP {{competitive}} small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib (Gleevec) in CML, patients rapidly develop resistance. In {{the case of}} erlotinib this typically occurs 8–12 months {{from the start of}} treatment. Over 50% of resistance is caused by a mutation in the ATP <b>binding</b> <b>pocket</b> of the EGFR kinase domain involving substitution of a small polar threonine residue with a large nonpolar methionine residue (T790M). While proponents of the 'gatekeeper' mutation hypothesis suggest this mutation prevents the binding of erlotinib through steric hindrance, research suggests that T790M confers an increase in ATP binding affinity, thereby reducing the inhibitory efficacy of erlotinib.|$|E

Investigations usually focus on two binding pockets, for the two side-chains. The <b>binding</b> <b>pocket</b> of the 5-methoxy group is more investigated than the other pocket. Researchers agree that the oxygen in the group binds to histidine (His) residues in transmembrane 5 (TM5) domain of the receptor with a hydrogen bond; His195 in MT1 and His208 in MT2. Another amino acid, valine 192 (Val), also participates in the binding of the 5-methoxy group by binding to the methyl portion of the group.|$|E

The structural determination {{of a large number}} of heme proteins has made it possible to study the detailed chemical and structural properties of heme binding environment. Knowledge of these characteristics can provide valuable guidelines in the design of novel heme proteins and help us predict unknown heme binding proteins. Results In this paper, we constructed a non-redundant dataset of 125 heme-binding protein chains and found that these heme proteins encompass at least 31 different structural folds with all-α class as the dominating scaffold. Heme <b>binding</b> <b>pockets</b> are enriched in aromatic and non-polar amino acids with fewer charged residues. The differences between apo and holo forms of heme proteins in terms of the structure and the <b>binding</b> <b>pockets</b> have been investigated. In most cases the proteins undergo small conformational changes upon heme binding. We also examined the CP (cysteine-proline) heme regulatory motifs and demonstrated that the conserved dipeptide has structural implications in protein-heme interactions. Conclusions Our analysis revealed that heme <b>binding</b> <b>pockets</b> show special features and that most of the heme proteins undergo small conformational changes after heme binding, suggesting the apo structures can be used for structure-based heme protein prediction and as scaffolds for future heme protein design. </p...|$|R

2500|$|R100943 {{inhibited}} HIV-1 and {{was considerably}} effective against {{a number of}} key NNRTI-resistant mutants like G190A mutation, which caused high-level resistance to loviride (α-APA) and nevirapine. [...] G190A mutation was thought to cause resistance by occupying a part of the <b>binding</b> <b>pocket</b> that would otherwise be filled by the linker part of the butterfly shaped NNRTIs. R100943, in the horseshoe mode of binding, is located at a distance of approximately 6.0 Å from G190. When compared with nevirapine and loviride which bind in the butterfly shape the ITU derivatives revealed improved activity against Tyr-181C and Tyr-188L mutants. A structural study suggested that a potent TIBO compound could partly supplement for the effects of the Tyr-181C mutation by moving itself in the non-nucleoside inhibitor <b>binding</b> <b>pocket</b> (NNIBP) of the mutant RT. In this context, R100943 has [...] torsional freedom that enables the conformational alternations of the NNRTI. This torsional freedom could be used by the ITU derivate to bind to a mutated NNIBP and thus compensating for the effects of a resistance mutation. Nevertheless, the potency of R100943 against HIV-1 resistant mutants was not adequate for it to be considered as an effective drug candidate. Additionally, [...] the chemical stability of the imidoylthiourea part of the ITU derivative was not favorable for an oral drug.|$|E
