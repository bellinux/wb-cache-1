Mohammad Hafeez plundered 57 not out from 37 balls, including four fours and three sixes. Pakistan eventually finished on 338/4 – their second-highest ODI score against India – after 50 overs.

500|$|DGC {{had hoped}} {{to have a new}} Nirvana album by the band ready for a late 1992 holiday season release; since work on it {{proceeded}} slowly, the label released the compilation album Incesticide in December 1992. A joint venture between DGC and Sub Pop, Incesticide collected various rare Nirvana recordings and was intended to provide the material for a better price and at better quality than was available via bootleg copies. As Nevermind had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> 15 months and had yielded a fourth single in [...] "In Bloom" [...] by that point, Geffen/DGC opted not to heavily promote Incesticide, which was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America the following February.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, two {{different}} projects were released, beginning with The Man from Utopia, a rock-oriented work.

The second album, London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. I, contained orchestral Zappa compositions conducted by Kent Nagano and {{performed by the}} London Symphony Orchestra (LSO). A second record of these sessions, London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. II was released in 1987. The material was recorded under a tight schedule with Zappa providing all funding, helped by the commercial success of [...] "Valley Girl". Zappa was {{not satisfied with the}} LSO recordings.

500|$|IGN's Travis Fahs, in {{discussing}} the SMS version, offered another opinion, praising the game as [...] "not only the crowning achievement of the series, but perhaps one the best games of the 8-bit era", drawing comparisons to both Mario and Zelda. Thomas again reviewed the Master System version of Wonder BoyIII: The Dragon's Trap when it was released two years later for the Virtual Console. In this review, he compares the gameplay to Metroid – more specifically the need to gather additional equipment and abilities to advance in the game. While he acknowledged that this version {{from one of the}} best Master System games as well as for any 8-bit system, he felt that the Master System's Virtual Console release had a reduced appeal. He said that the TurboGrafx-16 version Dragon's Curse had already <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> two years {{and that there was no}} difference in gameplay between the two versions, but there were improvements in graphics and sound in the TurboGrafx-16 version because of the system's superior capabilities. He also noted that the Master System version suffers from sprite flickering – something the TurboGrafx-16 version did not have. Despite the small differences in the two versions, he decided to give the Master System version the same rating as the TurboGrafx-16 version.|$|E
500|$|The third Test – Willis' 60th – came on 16 July, and England {{were able}} to level the series 1:1 thanks to Botham's Man of the Match {{performance}} (seven wickets, century and half century) and Willis's hostile bowling in the second innings. Willis bowled 30 wicketless overs in Australia's first innings, and made one one and two with the bat, before returning to bowl with Australia requiring 130 runs. At this point, England had been quoted at 500–1 to win the match. Willis began an [...] "inspired" [...] bowling performance, having requested to bowl downhill from the Kirkstall Lane end once Australia were 56/1. Trevor Chappell, Kim Hughes and Graham Yallop were caught by close fielders, while Rod Marsh and John Dyson were caught at fine leg and behind the wicket respectively trying to play the hook shot. Dennis Lillee was caught from the only ball Willis pitched up. Then when Willis uprooted Ray Bright's middle stump Australia were bowled out for 111, losing by 18 runs. Willis took 8/43, his career best Test figures. Two of his victims had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> zero, and three others for single figure scores. John Dyson had top-scored with 34 before Willis removed him. Willey recalled it as an [...] "amazing spell" [...] while Wisden called it [...] "the most staggering bowling of his life when his place again seemed threatened." ...|$|E
500|$|On 14 July 2008, Scunthorpe United signed Hooper {{for a fee}} of £125,000, {{rising to}} £175,000. Hooper signed a three-year {{contract}} with the League One club. In the first match of Scunthorpe's league campaign, Hooper scored in a 2–1 defeat at Glanford Park against Leeds United. He scored his first ever hat-trick against, Brighton, on 6 September and netted seven goals in his first seven matches to help Scunthorpe's promotion push. After this teammate Izzy Iriekpen paid tribute to Hooper saying that [...] "As soon as he started training you could see there was something special there." [...] On 28 October, league leaders, Scunthorpe suffered their first defeat in 12 matches as they lost 3–0 to Oldham Athletic. Hooper came off with an injury in this match and it was feared he had broken his foot and may have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> up to six months. However, scans later revealed that his foot was just badly bruised. He was labelled in the media as the latest from Scunthorpe's [...] "production line for talented young forwards." [...] He scored both goals in a win over promotion rivals Millwall on 31 January 2009. Scunthorpe reached {{the final of the}} Football League Trophy and faced League Two Luton Town. Hooper scored the opener but Luton pulled it back to win the match 3–2 in extra-time. At {{the end of the season}} Hooper won Scunthorpe's Player of the Year award. He said he was delighted with the team's performance during the season, in which he scored 24 league goals to help Scunthorpe gain promotion. He then set himself a target of 15 Championship goals for the next season. He scored 30 goals in all competitions throughout the 2008–09 season, just three goals short of Billy Sharp's record 33 goals in a season for Scunthorpe.|$|E

The Chinese Mountaineering Association (CMA) officially denied the sighting claim.

2500|$|The {{following}} day, {{several thousand}} strikers, families and sympathizers {{took part in}} a funeral procession down Market Street, stretching more than a mile and a half, for Nicholas Bordois and Howard Sperry, the two persons killed on [...] "Bloody Thursday". The police were wholly absent from the scene. The march made an enormous impact on San Franciscans, making a general strike, which had formerly been [...] "the visionary dream {{of a small group of}} the most radical workers, became [...] [...] [...] a practical and realizable objective."

2500|$|D Company {{departed}} Nui Dat at 11:00 on 18 August. Led by Smith {{and accompanied}} by a three-man New Zealand forward observer party under Captain Maurice Stanley, the 108-man company set-off quickly. Already behind schedule and with B Company having <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> longer than expected, Smith wanted to relieve Ford before more time elapsed and then follow the Viet Cong tracks to continue the pursuit that afternoon. Opting for speed, he adopted single file, with 12 Platoon under Second Lieutenant David Sabben in the lead. Despite the heat the company moved at a fast pace, traversing the low scrub, swamp and paddy fields as they closed in on B Company's position. Meanwhile, {{the rock and roll}} acts Little Pattie and Col Joye and the Joy Boys had flown into Nui Dat and were setting up for the afternoon concert. Many of the Australians were disappointed at the prospect of missing the entertainment, and as they patrolled east they occasionally heard the music through the trees. At 13:00 they married up with B Company {{on the edge of the}} Long Tan rubber plantation, approximately [...] from Nui Dat. D Company moved into all-round defence and sentries were posted. While the soldiers had lunch, Smith and Ford inspected the area with a small protection party. The position appeared to have been used by the Viet Cong as a staging area prior to the bombardment two nights before, while signs of casualties having been evacuated by cart were located. Blood stains were also uncovered, as was a quantity of equipment and sandals. The mortar and RCL firing locations were also examined. After briefing Smith, Ford and the remainder of B Company turned for Nui Dat. D Company subsequently took over the pursuit.|$|E
