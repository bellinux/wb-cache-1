5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of <b>babbling,</b> unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse <b>babbling,</b> consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
5|$|Many sources {{state the}} meaning of Rhondda as 'noisy', though this is a {{simplified}} translation without research. Sir Ifor Williams, in his work Enwau Lleoedd, suggests that the first syllable rhwadd {{is a form of}} the Welsh adrawdd or adrodd, as in 'recite, relate, recount', similar to the Old Irish rád; 'speech'. The suggestion is that the river is speaking aloud, a comparison to the English expression 'a <b>babbling</b> brook'.|$|E
5|$|Vocabulary {{development}} is a process by which people acquire words. <b>Babbling</b> shifts towards meaningful speech as infants grow and produce their first words around the age of one year. In early word learning, infants build their vocabulary slowly. By the age of 18 months, infants can typically produce about 50 words and begin to make word combinations.|$|E
50|$|The white-browed <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus superciliosus) is a small, {{gregarious species}} of {{bird in the}} family Pomatostomidae. They are endemic to the open {{woodlands}} and shrubby areas of central and southern Australia. The Latin name superciliosus refers to the supercilium or ‘eyebrow’, which is a feature synonymous with the pomatostomine babblers (Hall’s <b>babbler,</b> chestnut-crowned <b>babbler,</b> grey-crowned <b>babbler</b> and white-browed <b>babbler).</b>|$|R

5|$|Another {{topic is}} the {{relationship}} between brain structures and language acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as <b>babbling),</b> and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn a new language.|$|E
5|$|At {{each stage}} {{mentioned}} above, children play with sounds and learn methods {{to help them}} learn words. There is a relationship between children's prelinguistic phonetic skills and their lexical progress at age two: failure to develop the required phonetic skills in their prelinguistic period results in children's delay in producing words. Environmental influences may affect children's phonological development, such as hearing loss {{as a result of}} ear infections. Deaf infants and children with hearing problems due to infections are usually delayed in the beginning of vocal <b>babbling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Starting around 6 months babies {{also show}} an {{influence}} of the ambient language in their <b>babbling,</b> i.e., babies’ <b>babbling</b> sounds different depending on which languages they hear. For example, French learning 9-10 month-olds {{have been found to}} produce a bigger proportion of prevoiced stops (which exist in French but not English) in their <b>babbling</b> than English learning infants of the same age. This phenomenon of <b>babbling</b> being influenced by the language being acquired has been called <b>babbling</b> drift.|$|E
50|$|The moustached <b>babbler</b> (Malacopteron magnirostre) is {{a species}} of bird in the ground <b>babbler</b> family Pellorneidae. The species {{is also known as}} the brown-headed <b>babbler</b> or brown-headed tree-babbler.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{other species of}} Australian <b>babbler</b> which are similar in appearance; The white-browed <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus superciliosus), the chestnut-crowned <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus ruficeps) and the grey-crowned <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus temporalis). The white-browed <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus superciliosus) is {{considered}} most similar because of its size; however it can be distinguished by its thinner eyebrows {{and the lack of}} a sharp demarcation between the white breast and brown belly (which is diagnostic of Hall's <b>Babbler).</b> The chestnut-crowned <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus ruficeps) has a distinctive chestnut crown, thinner eyebrows, and white tips to the wing coverts; it also lacks a sharp demarcation between the breast and belly. The considerably larger grey-crowned <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus temporalis) also has thick white eyebrows, but has a distinctive grey crown and a large rufous patch in the spread wing.|$|R
50|$|The white-headed <b>babbler</b> or Cretzschmar's <b>babbler</b> (Turdoides leucocephala) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Leiothrichidae.It is found in Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Sudan.Its natural {{habitats}} are dry savanna and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. Its name is sometimes confused with the yellow-billed <b>babbler,</b> which is alternatively called the white-headed <b>babbler.</b>|$|R
25|$|Once {{the child}} hits the 8–12 month, range the child engages in {{canonical}} <b>babbling,</b> i.e. dada {{as well as}} variegated <b>babbling.</b> This jargon <b>babbling</b> with intonational contours the language being learned.|$|E
25|$|Typically by 6 {{months of}} age, all {{normally}} developing children will babble. However, infants with certain medical conditions or developmental delays may exhibit a delay or {{an absence of}} <b>babbling.</b> For example, infants {{who have had a}} tracheotomy typically do not babble because they are unable to phonate. Following decannulation, it has been found that these infants do produce more vocalizations, but the sounds or syllables are not as diverse as those found in typically developing infant's canonical <b>babbling</b> behaviour. Infants with severe apraxia may not babble, and may fail to produce first words. Communication by infants with apraxia may instead be in the form of grunting and pointing. Infants with autism may show a delay in <b>babbling,</b> and in some cases it may be completely absent. <b>Babbling</b> in children with autism tends to occur less frequently than in typically developing children, and with a smaller range of syllables produced during the canonical <b>babbling</b> stage. <b>Babbling</b> may also be delayed in individuals who are born with Down syndrome. The canonical stage may emerge 2 months later for individuals with Down syndrome compared to other infants, although, when produced, it is similar to <b>babbling</b> in typically developing infants.|$|E
25|$|After it was {{established}} that infants could babble {{with their hands}} and their mouths, the patterns in which productions occurred were studied. Speaking and signing infants follow very similar maturational paths in language acquisition. Both go {{through a number of}} stages, and exhibit similar complexity in their <b>babbling</b> sequences. In studies where deaf and hearing children were compared, children learning sign language produced more multi-movement manual <b>babbling</b> than children who were not learning a sign language. There are three main components of manual <b>babbling.</b> The hand gestures contain a restricted set of phonetic units, show a syllabic organization, and are used without reference or meaning. This is comparable to aspects of vocal <b>babbling</b> as mentioned above. It is difficult to study manual <b>babbling</b> as often the manual activity can be mistaken as gestures rather than signs. When signing children are in fact <b>babbling</b> it will most often take place in front of their torso in a designated area that is called the phonetic space. One of the most common forms of manual <b>babbling</b> is the extension and spreading of all fingers. This babble {{is also one of the}} first indicators that an infant will begin to make in manual communication.|$|E

25|$|<b>Babbling</b> is a {{stage in}} child {{development}} and a state in language acquisition during which an infant appears to be experimenting with uttering articulate sounds, but does not yet produce any recognizable words. <b>Babbling</b> begins shortly after birth and progresses through several stages as the infant's repertoire of sounds expands and vocalizations become more speech-like. Infants typically begin to produce recognizable words when they are around 12 months of age, though <b>babbling</b> may continue for some time afterward. <b>Babbling</b> {{can be seen as}} a precursor to language development or simply as vocal experimentation. The physical structures involved in <b>babbling</b> are still being developed in the first year of a child's life. This continued physical development is responsible for some of the changes in abilities and variations of sound babies can produce. Abnormal developments such as certain medical conditions, developmental delays, and hearing impairments may interfere with a child's ability to babble normally. Though there is still disagreement about the uniqueness of language to humans, <b>babbling</b> is not unique to the human species.|$|E
25|$|Manual <b>babbling</b> is {{structurally}} {{identical to}} vocal <b>babbling</b> in its development. Just as hearing and/or speaking infants babble with their mouths, infants {{who grow up}} with a sign language babble with their hands. If a hearing infant has deaf and/or mute parents or parents who otherwise use a sign language, {{he or she will}} still imitate the signs that they see their parents displaying. This is evidence that manual <b>babbling</b> is possible in both hearing and deaf infants, and in both speaking and mute infants.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{follow a}} general {{timeline}} of vocal developments in childhood. This timeline provides a general outline of expected developments {{from birth to}} age one. <b>Babbling</b> usually lasts 6–9 months in total. The <b>babbling</b> period ends at around 12 months {{because it is the}} age when first words usually occur. However, individual children can show large variability and this timeline is only a guideline.|$|E

25|$|Though {{there is}} {{disagreement}} about {{the uniqueness of}} language to humans, <b>babbling</b> {{is not unique to}} the human species. Many animals produce similar ranges of sounds to human infants. These ranges of sounds are used in the young of many species to experiment with sound-making capabilities, or to practice for future vocal behavior. Similar to human infants, animal <b>babbling</b> is restricted by physiological development.|$|E
25|$|<b>Babbling</b> {{is assumed}} to occur in all {{children}} acquiring language. Particularly it has been studied in English, Italian, Korean, French, Spanish, Japanese and Swedish. Infants across the world follow general trends in <b>babbling</b> tendencies. Differences that do appear {{are the result of}} the infants' sensitivity to the characteristics of the language(s) they are exposed to. Infants mimick the prosody of the language(s) they are exposed to. They use intonation patterns and timing that matches the characteristics of their parent language. Infants also babble using the consonants and vowels that occur most frequently in their parent language. Most <b>babbling</b> consists of a small number of sounds, which suggests the child is preparing the basic sounds necessary to speak the language to which it is exposed.|$|E
25|$|If <b>babbling</b> {{occurs during}} the first year of life, it can {{typically}} be concluded that the child is developing speech normally. As the baby grows and changes, his/her vocalizations change as well.|$|E

25|$|The human mouth {{moves in}} {{distinct}} ways during speech production. When producing each individual sound out loud, humans use {{different parts of}} their mouths, as well as different methods to produce particular sounds. During the beginnings of <b>babbling,</b> infants tend to have greater mouth openings on the right side. This finding suggests that <b>babbling</b> {{is controlled by the}} left hemisphere of the brain. The larynx, or voicebox, is originally high in the throat which allows the baby to continue to breathe while swallowing. It descends {{during the first year of}} life, allowing the pharynx to develop and facilitates the production of adult-like speech sounds.|$|E
