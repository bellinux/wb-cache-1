5|$|A natural <b>bobtail</b> can {{be found}} in some members of the breed, which is not a {{mutation}} of the T-box gene, and so is allowed under conformation show rules. Health-related research on the breed has been limited, with no major studies conducted in Britain. However, it has been included in studies outside the UK, including by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) in the United States. The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs, and endocrine and metabolic diseases common to small breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally.|$|E

Robinson was {{sponsored}} by her father {{for the remainder of the}} season after achieving her first race victory. She was voted the 1984 GATR Rookie of the Year. Robinson went to France to compete in the Paul Ricard Grand Prix Truck Race the following year, and took second in the 1986 Grand Prix of Trucks held in Mexico City. Robinson was victorious in the GATR Big Rig race at Flemington Speedway in 1987.|$|E

50|$|Urban legend {{says that}} <b>Bobtails</b> {{are the result}} of a {{crossbreeding}} between a domestic tabby cat and a wild bobcat. The unusual tail is actually the result of a random spontaneous genetic mutation within the domestic cat population, and {{may be related to the}} Manx gene, which is also dominant. Yodie, a short-tailed brown tabby male, was mated with a seal-point Siamese female to create the American <b>Bobtail's</b> original bloodline. Most of the early bloodlines have died out.|$|R
5|$|Bioluminescent {{organisms are}} {{a target for}} many areas of research. Luciferase systems are widely used in genetic {{engineering}} as reporter genes, each producing a different colour by fluorescence, and for biomedical research using bioluminescence imaging. For example, the firefly luciferase gene was used as early as 1986 for research using transgenic tobacco plants. Vibrio bacteria symbiose with marine invertebrates such as the Hawaiian <b>bobtail</b> squid (Euprymna scolopes), are key experimental models for bioluminescence. Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment. See also optogenetics which {{involves the use of}} light to control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels, and also see biophoton, a photon of non-thermal origin in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum emitted from a biological system.|$|E
25|$|In 1863, Smith and Chaffee {{sold their}} mill. They {{purchased}} and developed the <b>Bobtail</b> Mine near Black Hawk; the Gregory Mine in Teller County; and other mines. They held the properties {{for about a}} year before selling to a Rhode Island mining consortium (retaining a small interest). For many years, the <b>Bobtail</b> remained one of the greatest gold producers in Colorado. Late in 1863, Smith's third child, Nellie, was born.|$|E

5000|$|One {{theory of}} short-tailed cats in Japan {{indicates}} that they {{arrived from the}} Asian continent at least 1,000 years ago. In 1602, Japanese authorities decreed that all cats should be set free to help deal with rodents threatening the nation's silkworm population and associated industry. At that time, buying or selling cats was illegal, and from then on, <b>bobtailed</b> cats lived on farms and in the streets. Japanese <b>Bobtails</b> thus became the [...] "street cats" [...] of Japan.|$|R

5000|$|Fifty three {{bird species}} are {{known from the}} Sanctuary. Reptiles include rock dragons Ctenophorus ornatus (a fast running diurnal lizard {{abundant}} on the granite outcrops), <b>bobtails</b> Tiliqua rugosa, western bearded dragon Pogona minor, and Grey's skink Menetia greyii ...|$|R
25|$|Reptiles include dugite (Pseudonaja affinis), the {{southern}} blind snake (Ramphotyphlops australis), king's skink (Egernia kingii), <b>bobtail</b> (Tiliqua rugosa), marbled gecko (Christinus marmoratus), west coast ctenotus (Ctenotus fallens) and Burton's legless lizard (Lialis burtonis). There are three species of frogs: the moaning frog (Heleioporus eyrei), the western {{green tree frog}} (Litoria moorei) and the sign-bearing froglet (Crinia insignifera).|$|E
25|$|In 1876, a {{large group}} of Arikara men {{accompanied}} Custer and the 7th Cavalry on the Little Big Horn Expedition. Arikara scouts were in the lead when US Army forces attacked the widespread encampment of thousands of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors and families. Several scouts drove off Lakota horses, as they had been ordered, and others fought alongside the troopers. Three Arikara men were killed: Little Brave, <b>Bobtail</b> Bull, and Bloody Knife. During the subsequent confusion, when the scouts were cut off from the troopers, they returned to the base camp as they had been directed. After the battle, in which Custer and some 260 other US troops were killed, the search for scapegoats resulted in some critics mistakenly accusing the scouts of having abandoned the soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Reptiles {{that feed}} on slugs include mainly snakes and lizards. Some {{colubrid}} snakes are known predators of slugs. Coastal {{populations of the}} garter snake,Thamnophis elegans, have a specialised diet consisting of slugs, such as Ariolimax, while inland populations have a generalized diet. One of its congeners, the Northwestern garter snake (Thamnophis ordinoides), is not a specialized predator of slugs but occasionally feed on them. The redbelly snake (Storeria occipitomaculata) and the brown snake (Storeria dekayi) feed mainly but not solely on slugs, while some species in the genus Dipsas, Sibynomorphus (e.g. Sibynomorphus neuwiedi) and the common slug eater snake (Duberria lutrix), are exclusively slug eaters. Several lizards include slugs in their diet. This {{is the case in}} the slowworm (Anguis fragilis), the <b>bobtail</b> lizard (Tiliqua rugosa), the she-oak skink (Cyclodomorphus casuarinae) and the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara).|$|E
50|$|A {{mutation}} in a gene called the T-box transcription factor T gene (C189G) accounts for natural <b>bobtails</b> in 17 of 23 dog breeds studied, {{but not in}} another 6 dog breeds, for which the genetic mechanism {{is yet to be}} determined.|$|R
5000|$|American <b>Bobtails</b> {{are a very}} sturdy breed, {{with both}} short- and {{long-haired}} coats. Their coat is shaggy rather than dense or fluffy. They can have any color of eyes and coat, with {{a strong emphasis on}} the [...] "wild" [...] tabby appearance in show animals.|$|R
50|$|Although rare, <b>bobtails</b> {{do occur}} naturally, {{as in the}} Finnish Spitz and Karelian Bear Dog. This is an {{automatic}} disqualification for the showring for the Finnish Spitz and the Norrbottenspets, but not the Karelian. The hunting dog does not need a tail to be very efficient.|$|R
500|$|Wooden Leg spoke little English and Marquis spoke no Cheyenne. [...] They communicated {{mainly through}} Plains Indian Sign Language and only {{occasionally}} used an interpreter. [...] Wooden Leg provided maps and sketches {{as well as}} narrative. [...] The book is an amalgam of material from Wooden Leg along with support and corroboration from many contributors, including most of the seventeen Northern Cheyenne participants of the Battle of the Little Big Horn still alive {{at the time of}} the interviews. [...] From these, Marquis gives specific credits to Limpy, Pine, <b>Bobtail</b> Horse, Sun Bear, Black Horse, Two Feathers, Wolf Chief, Little Sun, Blackbird, Big Beaver, White Moon, White Wolf, Big Crow, Medicine Bull, and the younger Little Wolf. [...] The last is a different person from the more well known Chief Little Wolf who led the Northern Cheyenne Exodus from Oklahoma in 1877–79.|$|E
500|$|The Australian weasel shark feeds {{predominantly}} on octopuses such as Callistoctopus spp., either swallowing them {{whole or}} removing the arms first. Octopuses {{become increasingly important}} to its diet with age, such that sharks over [...] long eat almost nothing else; this increasing dietary specialisation {{is accompanied by a}} habitat shift toward coral reefs, which may serve to reduce competition between older and younger individuals. <b>Bobtail</b> squids represent a minor secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. In addition, other cephalopods, mud lobsters, crabs, and echinoderms are rarely consumed. This species probably hunts mostly at dawn and dusk; it typically seeks bottom-dwelling prey but will also rise into the water column if opportunity presents, such as during seasonal aggregations of broad squid (Uroteuthis etheridgei). Known parasites of the Australian weasel shark include the tapeworms Nybelinia mehlhorni, Paraorygmatobothrium kirstenae, and P. taylori, and the copepods Perissopus dentatus and Pseudopandarus australis.|$|E

50|$|Just {{like any}} animal, {{there can be}} a number of {{different}} health problems that could be related to the genetics. This being said, the Japanese <b>Bobtails</b> are generally healthy cats. The recessive gene paired with the shortened tails is not associated with any spinal or bone abnormalities.|$|R
50|$|As in {{most other}} breeds, Japanese <b>Bobtails</b> may have almost any color (or colors, {{arranged}} {{in any number of}} patterns). Predominantly-white calicoes (literally 'triple-') are especially favored by the Japanese and by cat fanciers, and strongly represented in folklore, though other colorations are also accepted by breed standards.|$|R
5000|$|American <b>Bobtails</b> are playful, {{social and}} {{moderately}} energetic. They reportedly have enough clever ingenuity {{to escape from}} rooms with closed doors and from secured cages. Being social with their owners and caretakers, they will ask for the attention they want by meowing or just by hopping into laps.|$|R
2500|$|Boxers were {{originally}} a docked and cropped breed, {{and this is}} still done in some countries. However, due to pressure from veterinary associations, animal rights groups, and the general public, both cropping of the ears and docking of the tail have been prohibited in many countries around the world. A line of naturally short-tailed (<b>bobtail)</b> Boxers {{was developed in the}} United Kingdom in anticipation of a tail docking ban there; after several generations of controlled breeding, these dogs were accepted in the Kennel Club (UK) registry in 1998, and today representatives of the <b>bobtail</b> line can be found in many countries around the world. However, in 2008 the FCI added a [...] "naturally stumpy tail" [...] as a disqualifying fault in their breed standard, meaning those Boxers born with a <b>bobtail</b> can no longer be shown in FCI member countries. In the United States and Canada as of 2012, cropped ears are still more common in show dogs, even though the practice of cosmetic cropping is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association. In March 2005 the AKC breed standard was changed to include a description of the uncropped ear, but to severely penalize an undocked tail. The tail of a boxer is typically docked before the cartilage is fully formed, between 3–5 days old. This procedure does not require any anesthesia or sutures when performed at this young age.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Europe {{on his own}} in early 1955, Brabham based himself in the UK, where he bought another Cooper to race in national events. His crowd-pleasing driving style initially betrayed his dirt track origins: as he put it, he took corners [...] "by using full [...] lock and lots of throttle". Visits to the Cooper factory for parts led to a friendship with Charlie and John Cooper, who told the story that after many requests for a drive with the factory team, Brabham was given {{the keys to the}} transporter taking the cars to a race. Brabham soon [...] "seemed to merge into Cooper Cars": he was not an employee, but he started working at Cooper daily from the midpoint of the 1955 season building a <b>Bobtail</b> mid-engined sports car, intended for Formula One, the top category of single seater racing. He made his Grand Prix debut at the age of 29 driving the car at the 1955 British Grand Prix. It had a 2-litre engine, half a litre less than permitted, and ran slowly with a broken clutch before retiring. Later in the year Brabham, again driving the <b>Bobtail,</b> tussled with Stirling Moss for third place in a non-championship Formula One race at Snetterton. Although Moss finished ahead, Brabham sees the race as a turning point, proving that he could compete at this level. He shipped the <b>Bobtail</b> back to Australia, where he used it to win the 1955 Australian Grand Prix before selling it to help fund a permanent move to the UK the following year with his wife Betty and their son Geoff.|$|E
2500|$|The order Teuthida is {{a member}} of the {{superorder}} Decapodiformes (from the Greek for [...] "ten legs"). Two other orders of decapodiform cephalopods are also called squid, although they are taxonomically distinct from Teuthida and differ recognizably in their gross anatomical features. They are the <b>bobtail</b> squid of order Sepiolida and the ram's horn squid of the monotypic order Spirulida. The vampire squid, however, is more closely related to the octopuses than to any squid.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{beneficial}} symbionts are acquired horizontally, {{from the}} environment or unrelated individuals. This requires that host and symbiont have some method of recognizing each other or each other’s products or services. Often, horizontally acquired symbionts are relevant to secondary rather than primary metabolism, for example for use in defense against pathogens, but some primary nutritional symbionts are also horizontally (environmentally) acquired. Additional examples of horizontally transmitted beneficial symbionts include [...] bioluminescent bacteria associated with <b>bobtail</b> squid and nitrogen-fixing bacteria in plants.|$|E
