40|$|Volvo Construction Equipment {{is highly}} {{regarded}} for robust products, {{but with an}} increasing competition in their market, development of the product portfolio {{is more important than}} ever. One step being carried out is to reduce losses in powertrains and increase the fuel efficiency for solutions such as articulated haulers and wheel loaders. This would eventually lower the fuel costs and emissions for the end customer. With this development, Volvo CE could strengthen their position in the market while also contributing to reducing the construction industry's environmental impact. By investigating the front <b>bogie</b> <b>axle</b> of the recently introduced hauler, Volvo A 60 H, important information about possible reductions and the distribution of the current losses were found. The investigation focused on a front <b>bogie</b> <b>axle,</b> but some of the results are applicable for other applications such as wheel loaders as well, since a lot of the technology in the axles are similar. A conceptual study was performed where completely new ideas were generated, such as implementing a dry sump system in the axle, as well as ideas for improving the subcomponents currently found in the axle. Two cases were presented for the evaluation of concepts, one with a fully loaded dump body and low speeds, and one with an unloaded dump body and a wider speed interval. The concepts were later evaluated using calculation tools such as MATLAB and a Simulink-model was created for the losses in the axle. When combining concepts that reduces load dependent losses, a potential reduction of 64 % of the axle's total losses was achieved for the case with a full dump body. The largest improvement found for the load independent losses was 8 % with an unloaded hauler and the highest speed investigated, 50 km/h. A dry sump system improves the axle's efficiency with 45 % in optimal working conditions, but was found to lower the efficiency at other conditions. Room for improvement of axle losses currently exists both for load dependent and load independent losses. The evaluation performed pointed towards the load dependent losses being the largest influence on the total losses, even with an unloaded dump body and high speeds. This is an interesting observation since a lot of work at Volvo CE has revolved around reducing the load independent losses since these are easier to affect with different lubrication levels and rotational speeds. A test methodology for load dependent losses should be implemented in order to validate the results of this thesis work, and also to aid further development at Volvo CE...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the research of}} possibilities of forwarding timber in an efficient and environmentally friendly way, under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils of Croatian lowland forests due to their increased moisture all the year round. Reduced soil bearing capacity causes restricted mobility and decreases the forwarder productivity, and also increases the level of damage caused to forest soil, reflected in its compaction and rutting (Fig. 1). In lowland even-aged forests of Croatia, main felling is mostly carried out based on wood cutting and processing by chain saws and forwarding of timber, processed by cut-to-length method, by six-wheel forwarders, usually not equipped with semitracks on rear wheels of <b>bogie</b> <b>axle</b> (Fig. 1). The analysis was carried out on {{the example of a}} medium-weight six-wheel forwarder Valmet 840. 2 (nominal load capacity of 12 t, whose dimensions and load distribution of empty vehicle are shown in Fig. 4), and this analysis involved as follows: 1) the effect of load reduction on forwarder efficiency, 2) forwarder environmental soundness under conditions of limited soil strength based on nominal ground pressure (Mellgren 1980) of front and rear wheels of the vehicle depending on the mass of loaded timber, vehicle with narrower (600 mm) and wider (710 mm) tires, or with tracks on wheels of the rear (<b>bogie)</b> <b>axle.</b> The limit value of environmental soundness would be the allowed ground pressure of limited bearing capacity < 60 kPa (Owende et al. 2002). The effect of load reduction (4 t, 8 t with respect to 12 t of the vehicle nominal load capacity) on forwarder efficiency with respect to the distance of timber forwarding, is expressed according to the multicriteria calculation model of productivity of these vehicles (Stankić 2010), which takes into account: 1) forwarder class 2) soil strength, 3) use of tracks, 4) felling density, 5) volume of the average felling tree and 6) distance of timber forwarding. The unit cost of timber forwarding was calculated according to machine rate made by the company »Hrvatske šume» d. o. o Zagreb for the forwarder Valmet 840. 2 (433. 19 kn/h). For calculating the nominal ground pressure (Fig. 3), a theoretical model of axle load distribution was used, the case of vehicle at standstill on level ground, depending on mass and length of loaded logs in the bunk area of the forwarder (Poršinsky and Horvat 2005). The analysis of axle load distribution was based on an average length of logs (4 m) made by cut-to-length method {{in the area of the}} Croatian lowland forests, and the mass of 1800 kg of a pair of semitracks. The wheel load assumed even load distribution of axle load by pertaining wheels. The contact area between wheels (tracks) and soil was calculated according to Mellgren (1980), for narrower (front – 600 / 65 - 34, rear – 600 / 55 - 26. 5) and wider (front – 710 / 55 - 34, rear – 710 / 45 - 26. 5) tires recommended by the manufacturer of forwarder. The analysis of the forwarder environmental soundness was based on: 1) values of nominal ground pressure of front and rear wheels of the vehicle depending on the mass of loaded timber, and use of narrower and wider tires, i. e. or use of tracks, and 2) the upper limit value of the allowed ground pressure (< 60 kPa) of limited bearing capacity (class 3 – Fig. 2), which prevails at the time of main felling in the Croatian lowland forests. The results of efficiency analysis of timber forwarding (Fig. 5) showed that the reduction of load under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils, as a measure for providing vehicle mobility as well as for diminishing the level of damage caused to forest soil, is highly unacceptable due to the decrease of productivity and increase of unit costs. The analysis of nominal ground pressure (Fig. 7) under wheels of the front axle and wheels (tracks) of the rear axle, showed that under conditions of limited soil bearing capacity: 1) the forwarder nominal load capacity may be used and that efficient timber forwarding may be performed, 2) the environmental soundness can be provided by the application of four-axle (eight-wheel) forwarders equipped with wider tires and half-tracks on wheels of front and rear <b>bogie</b> <b>axle</b> of the vehicle. These results should be used as guidelines for purchasing forwarders, and such approach would provide in future ecoefficient timber forwarding under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils in main felling sites of lowland forests...|$|E

Analiza je provedena na primjeru srednje teškoga šestokotačnoga forvardera Valmet 840. 2, a obuhvatila je: 1) utjecaj smanjenja tereta na djelotvornost forvardera, 2) okolišnu pogodnost forvardera u uvjetima ograničene nosivosti tla temeljem nominalnoga tlaka na podlogu (Mellgren 1980) prednjih i stražnjih kotača vozila ovisno o masi utovarenoga drva, opremljenosti vozila užim (600 mm) i širim (710 mm) gumama, odnosno opremljenosti kotača stražnje (bogi) osovine gusjenicama.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the assessment of}} environmental viability of timber extraction by two vehicles – forwarder and tractor assembly of 1 -m wood by two methods of mechanized forest residues management. In the first variant, the forwarder was first used for extracting industrial roundwood, and then for all the remaining parts of the tree as energy wood. The second method was the common practice, i. e. the forwarder was used for transporting industrial roundwood and large logs, {{and then in the}} second phase 1 -m firewood was processed from the remaining part of the tree, and it was extracted by the tractor assembly. In the third phase, the prepared (bunched) biomass was extracted by the forwarder. Environmental viability of the forwarder and tractor assembly for 1 -m firewood was analyzed based on CI*NGP– 1 ratio, i. e. index that represents the ratio between soil bearing strength, as the soil characteristics, and nominal wheel load, as the vehicle characteristics, so that it has a clear physical sense. This factor has been chosen because it consists of values that can be measured relatively easily or calculated with the use of semi-empirical models. The obtained values were compared with the recommended limit values from EcoWood project, which were based on the allowed 10 -cm depth of the wheel rut. The analysis showed that the reference wheel of the tractor assembly semitrailer was the most unfavorable and that no environmentally viable wood extraction can be expected from such a vehicle, but only economic mobility. This is why the use of a non-drive <b>bogie</b> <b>axle</b> is recommended for them. The wheels of the farming tractor have the most favorable indicators of environmental viability, and particularly so the front wheels, whose load gets considerably lower with the increase of the semitrailer load. The indicators of the forwarder are considerably better, and however in this case, too, for achieving an environmentally acceptable maneuverability, according to EcoWood classification, the soil must be very strong with the cone index between 700 kPa for ~ 50 % load and up to 900 kPa for the nominal load value. During measurement and analysis of results, great dispersion was observed of the measuring data of the soil cone index obtained by cone penetrometer, sampled on a relatively non-homogenous forest soil. Searching for an acceptable measurement procedure by cone penetrometer or the application of any other measuring method for the assessment of the soil bearing strength is a significant task of scientific research. The assessment of the skidder environmental viability will be a still greater challenge, because they are characterized by a considerably more complex travel dynamics than moving on slopes, dynamic redistribution of axle loads, achievement of tractive force, etc. This is also the opinion of Horvat et al.
