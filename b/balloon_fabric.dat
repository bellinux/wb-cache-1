50|$|In 1882 the School {{moved to}} the School of Military Engineering at Chatham where they {{discovered}} that Goldbeater's skin was superior <b>balloon</b> <b>fabric</b> than the material they had used previously - in particular {{it was easier to}} stow for transport. Templer also took out a patent for the use of unmanned balloons for “balloon photography” of the ground below.|$|E
5000|$|Self-propelled {{balloons}} {{were developed}} at Post Field in 1937. These balloons {{were designed to}} be powered to an observation point, their motors removed and observation baskets were attached. The famous balloon hangar, moved from Moffitt Field to Fort Sill in 1934, was intended to house dirigibles. The unique [...] "cross" [...] {{on the side of}} the building has no religious significance - it is part of an air circulation system designed to dry <b>balloon</b> <b>fabric</b> and parachutes.|$|E
30|$|Type III B endoleak can {{be caused}} by several reasons, as seems {{difficult}} to assess the exact cause, some hypotheses can be considered: repeated endovascular manipulations, aortic <b>ballooning,</b> <b>fabric</b> damage by metal stent and manufacturing defects (Abouliatim et al., 2010).|$|R
50|$|Some hakama {{during the}} Sengoku period had the hems made {{narrower}} than {{the body in}} imitation of the ballooning trousers worn by the Portuguese. This style carried on into the Edo period and became called karusan-bakama. In addition to the taper, they had a secured band of cloth—looking rather like a pants cuff—sewn around each leg’s hem, so the <b>ballooning</b> <b>fabric</b> would not open out like regular hakama. Also commonly known as tattsuke-hakama.|$|R
5000|$|All ram-air parafoils {{have two}} layers of fabric—top and bottom—connected by airfoil-shaped fabric ribs to form [...] "cells". The cells fill with high {{pressure}} air from vents that face forward {{on the leading edge}} of the airfoil. The fabric is shaped and the parachute lines trimmed under load such that the <b>ballooning</b> <b>fabric</b> inflates into an airfoil shape. This airfoil is sometimes maintained by use of fabric one-way valves called airlocks. The first ram-air test jump was performed by United States Navy test jumper Joe Crotwell.|$|R
5000|$|The farm mansion shop {{facilities}} had {{a sewing}} room to make <b>balloon</b> <b>fabric,</b> a chemical lab for the varnishes needed for sealing the fabric, basement equipment for making lighter-than-air hydrogen gas, a printing press for advertising, a carpentry {{shop for the}} gondola baskets, and a machine shop for metal parts. Their half inflated balloons on the property where the fabric was being processed looked like giant mushrooms and gave {{the impression that they}} were growing balloons on their farm as an unusual agricultural crop, hence the name [...] "balloon farm." ...|$|E
50|$|On 21 November 1783, {{the first}} free flight by humans {{was made by}} Pilâtre de Rozier, {{together}} with an army officer, the marquis d'Arlandes. The flight began from {{the grounds of the}} Château de la Muette close to the Bois de Boulogne park in the western outskirts of Paris. They flew about 3000 ft above Paris for a distance of nine kilometers. After 25 minutes, the balloon landed between the windmills, outside the city ramparts, on the Butte-aux-Cailles. Enough fuel remained on board {{at the end of the}} flight to have allowed the balloon to fly four to five times as far. However, burning embers from the fire were scorching the <b>balloon</b> <b>fabric</b> and had to be daubed out with sponges. As it appeared it could destroy the balloon, Pilâtre took off his coat to stop the fire.|$|E
50|$|The first manned flight {{commenced}} {{from the}} château on 21 November 1783, {{with a hot}} air balloon manufactured by the Montgolfier brothers lifting off from the garden of La Muette carrying Pilâtre de Rozier and the Marquis d'Arlandes. Among the crowd who observed this feat were the royal family and Benjamin Franklin. They flew for 25 minutes, travelling almost 300 metres above Paris and covering {{a distance of about}} nine kilometres, before landing between the windmills on the Butte-aux-Cailles. Enough fuel remained on board {{at the end of the}} flight to have allowed the balloon to fly four to five times as far. However, burning embers from the fire were scorching the <b>balloon</b> <b>fabric</b> and had to be extinguished with sponges, and so the pilots decided to land as soon as they were over open countryside.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{observation}} balloons {{were filled}} with hydrogen. The <b>balloons</b> were <b>fabric</b> envelopes filled with hydrogen gas, whose flammable nature led {{to the destruction of}} hundreds of balloons on both sides. Observers manning these observation balloons frequently had to use a parachute to evacuate their balloon when it came under attack. To avoid the potentially flammable consequences of hydrogen, observation balloons after World War I were often filled with non-flammable helium.|$|R
50|$|His {{academic}} work was eventually interrupted in 1916 by World War I {{when he took}} a commission in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He was later transferred to the nascent Royal Air Force where he worked on <b>balloon</b> and airship <b>fabric</b> design.|$|R
50|$|Chosen for {{its high}} gum content, agba formed easily without {{splitting}} and glued well. All the dinghy classes used just three agba veneers {{while some of}} the bigger boats used up to six. Initially all the veneers were laid at 45° while later boats changed to fore and aft outer planking for aesthetic reasons.With the keel, stem and transom in place, veneers were applied starting on the centreline and working out towards the shear. Each veneer was held in place by just three staples at the keel, bilge and shearline. Roller-application of Borden One-Shot waterproof glue preceded each veneer except the first. With all veneers in place a vacuum bag was drawn over the moulding and secured in place using a clamp plate and G-clamps.Early vacuum bags were made from war surplus barrage <b>balloon</b> <b>fabric.</b> After about 1950, individual rubber bags were prepared on the moulds using uncured rubber sheets which were subsequently vulcanised in the autoclaves used for production.|$|E
50|$|In 1917 he was {{appointed}} consulting chemist to the U.S. Bureau of Mines upon the inauguration by the Bureau of experiments with regard to helium and during the World War I he did {{a large amount of}} analytical and research work, the results of which influenced the designs of the various helium plants which were constructed by the government. He also made valuable research into the limits of the inflammability of helium and hydrogen mixtures and carried out a number of experiments on the permeability of <b>balloon</b> <b>fabric</b> by helium. In 1933 he developed a process for using chimney gases in the manufacture of a refrigerant. In 1936 he developed an ingenious new method for the accurate measurement of gaseous densities by means of a modified Westphal balance. The invention made it possible for the determination of molecular weight of gases with a degree of speed and precision not approached by any other method.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1908 {{a period}} of intense {{competition}} between Farman and Delagrange began, Delagrange now flying the new Delagrange II incorporating the modifications {{that had been made}} to Farmans aircraft, now renamed the Farman Ibis and with a new covering of [...] "Continental" [...] brand rubberised <b>balloon</b> <b>fabric</b> replacing the original varnished silk. [...] On 21 March Farman set a new record with a flight of just over 2 kilometres (1.25 miles). This was bettered by Delagrange, first with a flight of 2.5 km on 10 April and the next day with a flight of 3.925 km. In May both aircraft were fitted with side curtains between the inner set of interplane struts, and on May 30, while giving a series of demonstration flights in Italy, he succeeded in making a flight of 12.750 km lasting 15 minutes 25 seconds. [...] This time was bettered by Farman on 6 July, when he made a flight lasting 20 min 20 sec, a new record and winning Farman a 10,000 franc prize for the first officially observed flight lasting more than fifteen minutes. At the end of May Farman had also made the first flights in Europe with a passenger, carrying Ernest Archdeacon for 1,242 m at Ghent.|$|E
40|$|Materials for {{wrapping}} surgical dressings {{were studied}} by a method which measured the recontamination rate in packs stored for periods {{of up to}} several weeks. Of the materials tested a thick crêpe paper was better than calico and <b>balloon</b> cloth <b>fabrics.</b> Dressings wrapped in paper were not significantly contaminated after storage in dusty places for periods of up to three weeks. For added protection during handling and for convenience in transport and storage, paper packs may be sterilized and kept in paper-lined cartons. The shelf life in good storage conditions would be many weeks at least...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{exciting}} applications of high-temperature electronics is related to the exploration of the planet Venus. On this planet the atmospheric temperatures range from about 170 K at elevations of 100 km to a searing 730 K near the surface. Mechanisms for exploring the atmosphere might include balloons, airplanes, surface landers, and surface-launched probes. Balloons, for example, could fly in the region from 20 (320 C at 22 bars) to 60 km (- 20 C at 0. 2 bar). Suitable <b>balloon</b> <b>fabrics</b> presently exclude excursions to lower altitudes; however, adequate electronic systems could survive to 325 C. Small airplanes would require more sophisticated electronics for guidance and control. Long life surface landers would most likely be developed first, as these could be used to measure long-term variations in weather. Ranging transponders would be important for ephemeris development, measurement of spin state, and studies of general relativity. Surface temperatures of 460 C and pressures of 90 bars present a challenge to the developers of such instruments. Other space applications for high-temperature electronics include transponders for the surface of Mercury, near solar drag-free orbiters, and deep atmospheric penetrators for Jupiter and Saturn. Each of these has its own particular problems with respect to instrumentation adequate to meet the desired scientific goals. This paper is primarily concerned with defining possible mission applications, the required electronic systems, and the approaches that are currently being studied for their development...|$|R
30|$|Mouthing {{behavior}} in children {{plays an important}} role in their development by filling nutritive needs (e.g. breast or bottle feeding). In addition to nutritive needs children also express non-nutritive needs which involves mouthing objects such as toys, <b>balloons</b> and <b>fabrics,</b> for pleasure and in some cases to overcome the pain and discomfort of teething (Juberg et al. 2001; Tulve et al. 2002). Mouthing behavior of children take many forms such as licking, blowing, chewing, sucking etc. (active mouthing conditions) or using the mouth as a placeholder for objects (passive mouthing conditions) (Steiner et al. 1998). Infants and toddlers tend to mouth objects unintentionally. Constant mouthing of objects brings young children into repeated and frequent contact with the hazardous compounds present in the materials (Fessler and Abrams 2004).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{numerical}} {{scheme to}} predict the shape of large scientific balloons is described. The method ignores elastic deformation and asymmetric folding. Results are presented for geome-tries where all {{the tension in the}} <b>balloon</b> <b>fabric</b> is carried meridionally and the circumferential stresses are assumed to be zero, during ascent, {{as well as at the}} design float altitude. Some results with envelopes with non-zero circumferential stresses and with caps fitted are also given. Brief comparison with the results of more complex numerical models, reported by other workers, suggests that the method yields nearly identical geometric solutions...|$|E
40|$|Report {{describes}} {{methods and}} {{materials used in}} waterproofing and fireproofing airplane fabrics using dopes. The determination of the probable life of a <b>balloon</b> <b>fabric</b> in service by experimental means is of great value in choosing the most suitable fabrics for a given purpose and in pointing the way to improvements in compounding and construction. The usefulness {{of exposure to the}} weather for this purpose has been amply demonstrated. Various {{attempts have been made to}} reproduce by artificial means the conditions promoting deterioration in service, but without marked success. Exposure to the weather remains the most satisfactory method for this purpose, and a consideration of the characteristics of such tests is therefore important. This report presents the results of a typical series of exposure tests made in 1917...|$|E
50|$|A balloon is conceptually the {{simplest}} of all flying machines. The <b>balloon</b> is a <b>fabric</b> envelope filled with a gas that is lighter than the surrounding atmosphere. As the entire balloon is less dense than its surroundings, it rises, taking along with it a basket, attached underneath, which carries passengers or payload. Although a balloon has no propulsion system, a degree of directional control is possible through making the balloon rise or sink in altitude to find favorable wind directions.|$|R
40|$|Films {{reinforced}} with woven fabrics are {{being considered for}} the development of a material suitable for long duration scientific balloons under a program managed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Recently developed woven fabrics provide a relatively high strength to weight ratio compared to standard homogenous films. Woven fabrics also have better crack propagation resistance and rip stop capabilities when compared to homogenous lightweight, high strength polymeric films such as polyester and nylon. If joining is required, such as in the case of scientific <b>balloons,</b> woven <b>fabrics</b> have the advantage over polymeric thin films to utilize traditional textile methods as well as other techniques including hot sealing, adhesion, and ultrasonic means. Woven fabrics, however, lack the barrier properties required for helium filled scientific balloons, therefore lamination with homogenous films is required to provide the gas barrier capabilities required in these applications...|$|R
5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large <b>balloons.</b> The <b>fabric</b> material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|R
50|$|Balloon lights (also called {{lighting}} balloons) are {{a specialized}} type of luminaire used primarily for lighting in {{the motion picture}} industry, night highway construction, incident management, and public security applications such as police checkpoints. These luminaires typically consist {{of one or more}} high-intensity lamps surrounded by a translucent <b>fabric</b> <b>balloon.</b> The balloon acts as a diffuser to soften and disperse the light. The upper portion of the balloon sometimes has a reflective inner coating to direct more of the light downward. Some commercial products use a blower to expand the balloon, while others have an umbrella-like internal wire frame. The device is essentially an industrial version of a Japanese paper lantern.|$|R
50|$|Initially, entry was {{confined}} to the few service trades then open to women, namely MT Driver, Equipment Assistant, Cook, Clerk and Mess and Kitchen Staff. A small number of fabric workers were also employed. By August 1939, the following additional trades were authorised: Teleprinter Operators, Telephone Operators and Plotters. It was in these latter trades that women’s natural temperament gave them a clear advantage over men, and in which they made {{a significant contribution to}} the Battle of Britain. Hardly a photograph or film of those days, showing the WAAF manning the radar stations and plotting tables could fail to evoke memories of those brave women, most of whom would have been recruited and trained as original part-time pre-war auxiliaries, including some who worked on the <b>balloon</b> squadrons as <b>fabric</b> workers or, later in the war, handling the balloons themselves.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the Great Depression, in the 1920s, {{the city}} of New Bedford, {{along with many other}} {{northern}} textile towns had their own depression. During this time, four of the city's factories closed down. The following decade almost two dozen closed. Wamsutta, however, increased its sales in 1925 while others were liquidating and closing. By 1935, their sheets were henceforth known as Supercale instead of percale. Additionally, they manufactured a new product called Lustercale, a blend of 60% cotton and 40% high strength Avril rayon. This blend feels like cotton but is somewhat softer. At some point Wamsutta changed the fiber content of Lustercale to 100% cotton. They also created the perfect weave for sails on sailing ships. Furthermore, because of the wars, they created tailored their products for hot air <b>balloons,</b> gas mask <b>fabric,</b> military uniforms, and supplies. Many other fabric types were created for many other purposes and to this day Wamsutta remains a household name for fabrics.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, Quill was {{in charge}} of {{development}} and production flying at Vickers Supermarine, a job that he took so seriously that he felt he must obtain first-hand combat experience. Following the fall of France in 1940, he was determined to rejoin a fighter squadron. Forestalling opposition from his employers at Vickers Supermarine, he successfully argued the need to gain front-line operational experience and was temporarily released on 5 August 1940 to join No. 65 Squadron at RAF Hornchurch, privately hoping {{that it would be a}} permanent appointment. On 16 August he shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 109 and two days later he shared a victory over a Heinkel He 111. His combat days were short-lived because he was recalled after nineteen days to test the Spitfire Mk III, but they made Quill all the more determined to make the Spitfire an even better fighting machine, and his experiences in the Battle of Britain led to two important changes in the Spitfire. At high speed, the stick force from the ailerons had been very heavy, and this was found to be caused by the <b>ballooning</b> of the <b>fabric</b> covering of the ailerons, and so causing a thicker trailing edge section. This was cured by fitting stiffer, metal-covered ailerons. Quill also initiated an improvement in the optical quality of the cockpit side panels. His concerns about rearward vision from the cockpit led to changes and improvements to the canopy and rear fuselage. Later in 1940 he became chief test pilot for Vickers Armstrongs (Supermarine) Works.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Understanding of {{prostate}} anatomy has evolved as techniques have been refined and improved for radical prostatectomy (RP), particularly regarding {{the importance of}} the neurovascular bundles for erectile function. The objectives of this study were to develop inexpensive and simple but anatomically accurate prostate models not involving human or animal elements to teach the terminology and practical aspects of nerve-sparing RP and simple prostatectomy (SP). Materials and Methods: The RP model used a Foley catheter with ballistics gelatin in the <b>balloon</b> and mesh <b>fabric</b> (neurovascular bundles) and balloons (prostatic fascial layers) on either side for the practice of inter- and intrafascial techniques. The SP model required only a ripe clementine, for which the skin represented compressed normal prostate, the pulp represented benign tissue, and the pith mimicked fibrous adhesions. A modification with a balloon through the fruit center acted as a “urethra. ” Results: Both models were easily created and successfully represented the principles of anatomical nerve-sparing RP and SP. Both models were tested in workshops by urologists and residents of differing levels with positive feedback. Conclusions: Low-fidelity models for prostate anatomy demonstration and surgical practice are feasible. They are inexpensive and simple to construct. Importantly, these models can be used for education on the practical aspects of nerve-sparing RP and SP. The models will require further validation as educational and competency tools, but as we move to an era in which human donors and animal experiments become less ethical and more difficult to complete, so too will low-fidelity models become more attractive.
