During his tenure of seven years, he provided the NBR with 185 new locomotives; but only eight of these were suitable for hauling express passenger trains, the first two of which were 2-4-0s built in 1869 (the 141 Class), which were considered to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> engines.|$|E

His mastery over the best county spin bowlers even on the most treacherous pitches is remarkable, but he could also <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> against the fastest bowling because he could get closer into line than just about any batsman in cricket history.|$|E

Tsonga is also known for his clutchness on serve, having saved 67% of the break points he faced in his career as of today, which ranks him in the 4th position among active players. His two weaknesses are his return of serve and to a lesser extent his backhand.|$|E

25|$|The {{side was}} not {{completely}} bereft of quality in the bowling department, however: Alf Gover took 200 wickets in both 1936 and 1937, a fine achievement for a fast bowler on the flat Oval track. The Oval pitches of this period tended to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> for batting, and many matches were drawn. The club captain {{for much of this}} period was the affable and bohemian Percy Fender, whose closest colleague was the England captain of Bodyline fame (or infamy), Douglas Jardine. In 1938, Surrey played a home match away from The Oval for the first time, at Woodbridge Road in Guildford. After 1939, cricket took a break as the Second World War occupied the nation and The Oval was seized for Government use.|$|E
25|$|Balochi is {{a provincial}} {{language}} spoken as first language by about 3.5% of Pakistanis, mostly in Balochistan. Sindh and southern Punjab.

The Eastern Hill Balochi or Northern Balochi are distinct dialects.The Kethran language in North East Balochistan is also a variant of Balochi. It is one of the 9 distinguished languages of Pakistan.

The 1972 Five Nations Championship was not completed due to the Troubles in Northern Ireland when Scotland and Wales refused to play their Five Nations away fixtures in Ireland.

He's really the nicest old guy in the whole book. Everybody is a bit suspect, and still are at the end. Old Vanger has a nice straight line, and he gets his wish." [...] Plummer wanted to imbue the character with irony, an element he found to be absent from the novel's Henrik. [...] "I think that the old man would have it," [...] he opined, [...] "because he's a very sophisticated old guy [...] used to a great deal of power.

500|$|... "Not to everyone's taste, granted, [...] is {{nevertheless}} an original and disturbing take on modern love stories" [...] was {{the view of}} Stuart Willis writing for the Sex-Gore-Mutants website. Believing that the film was a [...] "pleasant surprise", he praised the improvised nature of the work, believing that it created believable scenes and allowed the viewer {{to get to know}} the characters [...] "almost without realising." [...] He considered the acting to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>good,</b> and particularly praised Hoyle's ability to portray a paedophile grooming a young man in a way that was both [...] "pathetic and truly sinister all at once". Rather than falling into [...] "tasteless exploitation", Willis thought that the film was saved by a lack of sensationalism. Praising the exterior scenes as [...] "beautifully atmospheric" [...] and the music as [...] "fitting the laconic mood and sense of ill-foreboding well", he considered the film to be a good example of low-key filmmaking, akin to that produced in Britain during the early 1980s.|$|E
500|$|According to Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner, Harrison's Revolver {{compositions}} – [...] "Taxman", {{which opened}} the album, the Indian music-styled [...] "Love You To", and [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] – established {{him as a}} songwriter within the band. Recalling the release in the 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Sheffield said that Revolver displayed a diversity of emotions and styles ranging from the Beatles' [...] "prettiest music" [...] to [...] "their scariest", among which [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] represented the band at [...] "their friendliest". Commenting on the unprecedented inclusion of three of his songs on a Beatles album, Harrison told Melody Maker in 1966 that he felt disadvantaged in not having a collaborator, as Lennon and McCartney were to one another. He added: [...] "when you're competing against John and Paul, you have to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> to even get in the same league." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} of the album, [...] "International Velvet", {{featuring}} the line [...] "Every day when I wake up I thank the Lord I'm Welsh" [...] and Welsh language verses, received additional attention from the media.

Our football team is shit. The song is saying, despite all these things, I still {{wake up in the morning}} and thank the Lord that I'm Welsh. Hopefully by now people realise that Wales is brimmed full of talent and we're great people with massive brains." [...] In front of 70,000 spectators, Catatonia performed [...] "International Velvet" [...] at the opening ceremony of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} cast for their hamming and {{effective}} delivery of what Bennion called the [...] "stilted, stagy dialogue"; Toby Dantzic, writing for The Telegraph Saturday Review, called the acting [...] "stellar". The {{attention to detail}} by {{the cast and crew}} was widely praised; the [...] "dated styling" [...] was, for Jackson, [...] "spot on". Louisa Mellor, of the entertainment website Den of Geek, explained that [...] "from the aspect ratio to the music, title font, sets, lighting, camera moves, hair, make-up and costume... everything was recognisable from the sort of 1970s television plays that, when you think about it, may have provided inspiration for Inside No. 9 as a whole". For her, [...] "the retro send-up provided enough entertainment on its own—these days you have to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> to make TV that bad". White, similarly, argued that [...] "it's a gargantuan, incredibly precise task to make such gloriously terrible TV, a skill reserved for only the greatest of comics". Even despite the flaws of the film within the episode, Rebecca Nicholson, of theguardian.com, found it [...] "relatively gripping". Sarah Hughes, writing in i, compared [...] "The Devil of Christmas" [...] to an episode of Tales of the Unexpected; it was she, argued, [...] "both an immaculately conceived homage to Roald Dahl's original anthology series and a worthy contender for its crown".|$|E
500|$|Julius Carry saw great {{potential}} {{in the character of}} Bowler. He had researched black cowboys for a project in college and used that knowledge in his portrayal of Bowler. Carry said that Bowler was similar to the real-life black deputy U.S. Marshal Bass Reeves, in that [...] "Reeves always got his man and would often pull off incredible tricks to bring people in." [...] Carry knew Clemenson from the time they worked together on the Western television pilot Independence. He had no knowledge of Campbell, but approved of the choice for the leading man after watching Army of Darkness. He later told Starlog, [...] "I saw that he would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> with the physical stuff and that he could deliver a one-liner. I knew the situation would be good." [...] The original direction for Bowler was to have him constantly oppose Brisco, but as the series progressed the writers saw the good-natured chemistry between the actors and decided to make Brisco and Bowler a team. Bowler's race was never an issue in the show. [...] According to Cary Darling, a television critic, this attitude is different from serious Westerns and [...] "may hew more to the truth than one might think". [...] He said historians have noted that black cowboys were common and that conflicts with white cowboys were rare.|$|E
