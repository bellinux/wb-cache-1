40|$|This {{research}} had been conducted during 28 months (from September 1997 to December 1999). Scopes of research are : 1) Aerial map interpretation {{in order to}} find the existing land used map. 2) Analysis of environmental potential and <b>biogeophysic</b> components as basic data for evaluating the Environmental Sensitivity index (ESI), 3) Analysis of hydro-oceanography dynamical as well as socio, economic and cultural feasibility whitch are related to ESI for deciding the Marine National Park (MNP) zone, planning for MNP management, and 4) Study on activities of MNP management planning.

40|$|Land use {{change can}} be {{predicted}} by spatial modeling. One of spatial method to predict land use change is CLUES (Conversion of Land Use Changes and its Effect at small regional extent). The objective of the research is to determine factors that influence land use change in Kabupaten Majalengka and to predict its land use in the future. Data applied in this research project was <b>biogeophysic,</b> socio economic and existing land use data of Kabupaten Majalengka. Eight land use classes applied were shrub, forest, pond, dry land agriculture, pasture, settlement, and plantation and rice field. Land use classes were dependent variables; and biogeophysical and socio economical data were independent variables.   Binary logistic regression was applied to determine influenced factors to land use change. Factors that influence of type of land use’s occurrence were different {{for each type of}} land use. The value of the factors was used as an input in land use modeling using CLUES.   Scenario that used were scenario with land use change rate same as previous change. The simulation was applied for 12 years with the baseline data in the year of 2009. The simulation result shows that the land use types of shrub, forest, and plantation are decrease. The area that increased are land use types of dry land agriculture, settlement and rice field; however land use types of pond and pasture are remain constant...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGenotype {{interaction}} with environment is general phenomenon {{in many countries}} with high <b>biogeophysic</b> variability as Indonesia. Different responses two or more genotypes a certain environment to the other environment {{will be followed by}} modification sequence genotype. Stability analysis and adaptability could be used to identify genotype in multilocation test. An experiment had been held in April until July 2013 at 8 locations, are experiment garden Inlitkabi Genteng Banyuwangi, Muneng Probolinggo, Kendal Payak Malang, Lumajang, Nganjuk, Ngale-Ngawi, and State Polytechnic of Jember. The choice of locations are based on centers production and altitude (≤ 500 m asl). Seven promising lines of soybean Jember multi location tested were: (1) GHJ- 1, (2) GHJ- 2, (3) GHJ- 3, (4) GHJ- 4, (5) GHJ- 5, (6) UNEJ- 1, (7) UNEJ- 2. As well as three varieties, namely: Malabar as donor parent early maturity, (9) Ringgit as standard of comparation Malabar as donor parent early maturity, (9) Ringgit as standard of comparation standard of comparation is susceptible to leaf rust, and (10) Wilis. GHJ- 1 line was result of crossing between Unej- 1 x Malabar, while GHJ- 2 was a reciprocal hybrid. GHJ- 3 was the result of crossing between Unej- 2 x Malabar, where as line GHJ, GHJ- 4 and GHJ- 5 was a standard of hybrid (Malabar x Unej- 2). Crosses with Malabar varieties intended to shorten the lifespan of the results of its cross. Results of the experiment were as follows: Genotype GHJ which were stable and could adapt on eight research environments with high yield and early maturing age were (a) GHJ- 3 genotype where the average yield is 3. 02 t/ha was almost equal to the average population 3. 04 t/ha, was the highest results in locations Malang 3. 62 t/ha and was the highest genotype ranking Ngawi location. The mean age genotype ripe pods were shorter than the average population that is 77 days, for Probolinggo, Jember and Jombang were 73 - 75 after planting. (b) GHJ- 5 the average of the results of genotype 3. 12 t/ha was higher than the average population. The results per hectare GHJ- 5 genotype in Jember, Malang and Lumajang was the highest one spot compared to the other Genotypes. The highest result in the location of Jember was 3. 92 t/ha. The mean age Genotype ripe pods were shorter than the average population that was 79 days, for Probolinggo and Jombang were 75 days after planting...|$|E
