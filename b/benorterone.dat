5000|$|<b>Benorterone</b> (INN, USAN) (developmental code names SKF-7690, FC-612), {{also known}} as 17α-methyl-B-nortestosterone, is a steroidal, pure {{antiandrogen}} that was never marketed. Unlike other steroidal antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate (CPA), it is not also a progestogen, instead acting as a selective androgen receptor antagonist similarly to nonsteroidal antiandrogens such as bicalutamide. However, although it is described as not being a progestogen, <b>benorterone</b> was found to produce [...] "a highly variable decrease in plasma testosterone levels" [...] (the reasons for this are unclear, as other pure antiandrogens such as cyproterone (not CPA) and bicalutamide do not do this and instead produce consistent increases in testosterone levels).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Benorterone</b> (SKF-7690, FC-612): A pure AR {{antagonist}} without progestogenic activity, {{though with}} some antigonadotropic activity through an undefined mechanism. One {{of the earliest}} antiandrogens. Studied {{in the treatment of}} acne, seborrhea, and hirsutism in the 1960s but was found to produce a very high rate of gynecomastia in males. Development was discontinued in favor of cyproterone acetate, which showed only a low rate of gynecomastia in males.|$|E
50|$|Cyproterone (INN) (developmental code names SH-80881, SH-881), {{also known}} as 1,2α-methylene-6-chloro-δ6-17α-hydroxyprogesterone is a steroidal, pure {{antiandrogen}} that was studied {{in the mid to}} late 1960s and early 1970s but was never marketed for medical use. It is the free alcohol or non-17α-acetylated analogue of cyproterone acetate (CPA), an antiandrogen, progestin, and antigonadotropin that was introduced instead and is widely used clinically. Along with <b>benorterone,</b> BOMT, and flutamide, cyproterone {{was one of the first}} pure antiandrogens to be developed.|$|E
50|$|Developed in {{the late}} 1950s and trialed in the 1960s, <b>benorterone</b> was the first {{antiandrogen}} to be studied in humans. The drug {{was found to be}} effective in the treatment of acne, seborrhea, and hirsutism in women, and unlike progestogenic antiandrogens such as CPA, seldom produced side effects in women, nor affected menstruation. However, in males, the drug produced gynecomastia (in 12 out of 13 young men), and upon the observance of this side effect, was soon withdrawn from clinical trials. Subsequently, CPA, which has a much reduced risk of gynecomastia by virtue of its concomitant progestogenic and antigonadotropic actions, was developed and introduced in 1973 instead.|$|E
50|$|BOMT (developmental {{code name}} Ro 7-2340), {{also known as}} 6α-bromo-4-oxa-17α-methyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic, steroidal, pure {{antiandrogen}} that was first developed in 1970 and was never marketed for clinical use. It is the 6α-brominated, 4-oxygenated, and 17α-methylated derivative of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Along with <b>benorterone,</b> cyproterone (and its acetate ester, cyproterone acetate), and flutamide, BOMT was among the earliest antiandrogens to be developed and extensively studied, although it is less well-documented {{in comparison to the}} others. BOMT has been investigated clinically in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, though development for this use did not continue. There was also interest in BOMT for the potential applications of acne, androgenetic alopecia, and possibly prostate cancer, but it was not developed for these indications either.|$|E
5000|$|BOMT is a {{selective}} competitive antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), {{although it is}} described as an [...] "only relatively weak competitor." [...] The drug shows no androgenic, estrogenic, or progestogenic activity even at high doses, nor any inhibition of 5α-reductase, though it does show weak antigonadotropic effects. Due to its selectivity for and competitive inhibition of the AR, BOMT {{has been described as}} a [...] "true" [...] antiandrogen, similarly to <b>benorterone,</b> cyproterone, and flutamide. Like other steroidal antiandrogens, BOMT may actually be a weak partial agonist of the AR, as it appears to have the potential for weak androgenic effects in specific situations. On the basis of animal research, BOMT does not appear to act as an AR antagonist in central nervous system tissues, and in relation to this, does not disinhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis or increase testosterone levels.|$|E
50|$|Antigonadotropins like estrogens and progestogens {{were both}} first {{introduced}} in the 1930s. AR antagonists were first discovered in the early 1960s. The steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate was discovered in 1961 and introduced in 1973 and {{is often described as}} the first antiandrogen to have been marketed. However, spironolactone was introduced in 1959, and although its antiandrogen effects were not recognized or taken advantage of until later and were originally an unintended off-target action of the drug, it may be more appropriate to regard it as the first antiandrogen to have been introduced. In addition to spironolactone, chlormadinone acetate and megestrol acetate are steroidal antiandrogens that are weaker than cyproterone acetate but were also introduced earlier, in the 1960s. Other early steroidal antiandrogens that were developed around this time but were never marketed include <b>benorterone</b> (SKF-7690; 17α-methyl-B-nortestosterone), BOMT (Ro 7-2340), cyproterone (SH-80881), and trimethyltrienolone (R-2956).|$|E
