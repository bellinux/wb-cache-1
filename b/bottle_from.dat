25|$|In 1948 {{he worked}} as a doctor in Renfrew. A resident, Bill Johnston, {{recalled}} the time when, as a lad, Dr. Banda came to his home to see his father who had a nasty boil {{on the back of his}} neck. His father was a respected church elder in the town. Dr. Banda took a small <b>bottle</b> <b>from</b> his case, asked for some boiling water and poured some into the bottle. Emptying the water out, he quickly placed the open end on Bill's father's boil where of course it stuck as the steam condensed. With a cry of anguish, his father leapt to his feet and chased the doctor round the kitchen table with the bottle fastened to his neck. Bill was dumbfounded at hearing his father use language that he had never heard before. Note, however, that this account conflicts with other sources, notably Philip Short's biography which cites a letter from Banda stating that he moved to London in 1945, two months after the armistice, buying a practice in the North London suburb of Harlesden. Initially, he stayed at Mrs. French's house, with Mr. French joining them in October 1945. Later, he bought his own house in Brondesbury Park. Mrs. French moved in as his housekeeper, together with her husband. According to other accounts, he lodged in a hotel, The Conway Court, in Paddington run by Mrs Janet Evans. Reportedly, he avoided returning to Nyasaland for fear that his new-found financial resources would be consumed by his extended family back home.|$|E

The bottle and letter are {{on display at the}} Portledge Hotel at Fairy Cross, in Devon, England.

The ivory was apparently recovered some years later but the leather bags supposed to contain gold dust were never found.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2010, 168 bottles {{were found}} on board a {{shipwreck}} near the Åland Islands in the Baltic Sea by Finnish diver Christian Ekström. Initial analyses indicated {{there were at least}} two types of <b>bottle</b> <b>from</b> two different houses: [...] in Reims and the long-defunct Champagne house Juglar (absorbed into Jacquesson in 1829.) The shipwreck is dated between 1800 and 1830, and the bottles discovered may well predate the 1825 [...] referenced above. When experts were replacing the old corks with new ones, they discovered there were also bottles from a third house, Heidsieck. The wreck, then, contained 95 bottles of Juglar, 46 bottles of , and four bottles of Heidsieck, in addition to 23 bottles whose manufacture is still to be identified. Champagne experts Richard Juhlin and Essi Avellan, MW described the bottles' contents as being in a very good condition. It is planned {{that the majority of the}} bottles will be sold at auction, the price of each estimated to be in the region of £40,000–70,000.|$|E

Richis, still convinced of Grenouille's guilt, threatens him with his sword, but he is then overwhelmed by the scent and embraces Grenouille as his [...] "son." [...] Walking out of Grasse unscathed, Grenouille has enough perfume to rule the world, but has discovered that it will not allow him to love or be loved like a normal person. Disenchanted by his aimless quest, he returns to the Parisian fish market where he was born and pours the remaining perfume over his head.

2500|$|After making {{wine for}} 25 years, Kuleto {{established}} the Kuleto Estate Family Winery on an [...] property in Napa Valley. [...] He purchased the estate in 1992 {{as a replacement}} for his old home, which had burned down, and spent the next five years building a [...] home there, which he called Villa Cucina. [...] Although he began growing grapes on the ranch in 1993, and made his own wine, he had not opened up a commercial winery. [...] Construction of the new winery began in 1999 and ended in 2003. [...] As of 2005 the winery was producing 7,500 cases per year of wine, which it sold in the range of $20 to $50 per <b>bottle,</b> <b>from</b> [...] of grapes. [...] Kuleto served as owner, builder, designer, and co-winemaker. [...] He also raises livestock and farms fish, produce and olives on the property, most of which are processed for private events held on the property. [...] In 2009 Kuleto sold a controlling interest in the wine business (but {{only a small portion of}} the grounds and vineyards) to a small wine conglomerate run by financier William P.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} famous, alleged purveyors of label fraud is wine {{collector}} Hardy Rodenstock. In the 1980s and 1990s, Rodenstock hosted a series of high-profile wine tasting events of old and rare wines from his collection, including many from the 18th and 19th centuries. He invited to these tastings dignitaries, celebrities and internationally acclaimed wine writers and critics such as Jancis Robinson, Robert M. Parker, Jr. and Michael Broadbent {{who at the time}} was a director at the London auction house Christie's and considered one of the world's foremost authorities on rare wine. At one such tasting, Rodenstock produced 125 vintages of Château d'Yquem, including a very rare <b>bottle</b> <b>from</b> the 1784 vintage. In addition to holding these extravagant tastings, Rodenstock also sold many bottles from his collection at auction houses, which supposedly regularly inspect and research wines for authenticity. One such lot that Rodenstock sold were the rare [...] "Jefferson bottles", reportedly rare Bordeaux wines bottled for the American president, Thomas Jefferson. American businessman Bill Koch bought four of these Jefferson bottles which were later determined to be fake - the engravings on the bottle that purportedly linked them to Jefferson were determined to have been done with a high-speed electric drill similar to a dentist's drill; technology that did not exist until modern times. This revelation cast a net of suspicion on the authenticity of all the rare bottles that Rodenstock served at his tastings and sold at auctions.|$|E
