Small bale forage contained higher pH, higher ethanol and lower lactic acid content, compared to general levels in chopped silo silage, but low levels of ammonia-N and butyric acid. There were no general effects of dry matter or extent of fermentation on α-tocopherol and β-carotene contents in the preserved forages, but linear positive correlations between the vitamins and lactic acid existed.

40|$|In Sweden, {{there are}} large {{quantities}} of straw {{that could be used}} for heating purposes. The amount of straw available for use as fuel has been estimated at 1 million tonnes or approx. 4 TWh. Today, only a fraction of this quantity is used. This can be compared to the approx. 1. 5 million tonnes of straw that are used for fuel purposes in Denmark. The main purpose of this project was to present an overview of the existing techniques for harvesting, transport and combustion of straw in small- and large-scale systems, and to suggest research and development projects to increase the future use of straw for fuel purposes in Sweden. In the study, systems for harvesting, transport and storage of <b>big</b> <b>bales</b> (round <b>bales</b> and <b>big</b> square <b>bales),</b> and chaffing, gathering, transport and storage of loose chaffed straw are presented. Alternative systems with field-wafering and whole crop harvesting are also described. In addition, a study tour was made of fuel straw practitioners in southern Sweden and Denmark in order to review practical experiences. Costs were calculated for different systems including harvesting, transport to storage, storage, transport to heating plant and handling at heating plant for: <b>big</b> square <b>bales,</b> medium-sized square bales, round bales, chaffed loose straw and field-wafered straw. Both outdoor and indoor storage of the straw were studied. Systems with <b>big</b> square <b>bales</b> were cheapest, followed by systems with medium-sized square bales and field-wafered straw. Indoor storage had a considerable influence on the costs. Field-wafered straw had cost benefits in long transport and indoor storage due to its high bulk weight, which resulted in a high utilization of both transport vehicles and storage. When straw is burnt, several quality parameters are important, e. g. moisture content, bulk weight, ash content, ash melting point and lower heat value. Too high a moisture content results in operational disruption to the straw feeding equipment and might result in uneven combustion in the furnace. Ash with a low melting point may melt in the furnace and form clinker, which causes operational disruption. Straw should have a low content of alkali metals and chlorine to avoid the formation of clinkers. The content of these elements declines if the straw is left in the field, and, if possible, exposed to precipitation before harvesting. To obtain fuels with more well-defined properties that can be burnt in existing furnaces, the straw might be further processed into briquettes, pellets or powder. Techniques for handling and burning of straw are described on scales suitable for farms and district heating plants. New technology such as gasification, flash-pyrolysis, stirling engines, steam engines and use of straw as a raw material for the production of ethanol, methanol and Fischer-Tropsch diesel are reviewed. It is recommended in the study that future research and development projects should focus on the following fields: information and demonstration, handling costs and harvesting reliability, fuel quality, up-grading and ash handling. The techniques used today for handling and combustion of fuel straw work satisfactorily and at a competitive cost. Therefore, to quickly increase the use of fuel straw, there is a need for a variety of information work as well as demonstration plants that will serve as good practical examples. To increase the use of straw in regions with inferior harvesting conditions, there is a need for investigations about the variation in handling costs and harvesting security between different years. Furthermore, there is a need for studies of how various factors (rain, dew, soil type etc.) influence fuel quality, and for development of reliable and quick methods for measurement of various fuel properties. As straw is a comparatively cheap raw material, the possibilities to process it further and/or use it in new technical applications should be studied further. Finally, alternative ways to handle the ash, e. g. mixing it with various organic fertilizers, should be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|Reintroductions of {{the boll}} weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, into {{areas of the}} United States {{where it has been}} {{eradicated}} or suppressed are very expensive to mitigate. There is concern that a cotton gin in an eradication zone may serve as a site of boll weevil reintroductions when processing cotton harvested in a neighboring infested zone. Similarly, there is a question whether weevil-free areas can safely import gin products, such as cottonseed and baled lint, from infested areas without risking an introduction. Many countries require fumigation of imported U. S. cotton bales to protect against boll weevil introductions, costing the U. S. cotton industry millions of dollars annually. In previously reported experiments, we quantified the potential for boll weevils to survive passage through precleaning machinery in the gin. In this study, we quantified survival potential of boll weevils passing through the gin stand and segregating into the cottonseed, mote, or lint fractions. We also examined boll weevil survival when passed with ginned lint through a lint cleaner. We present a flow chart of experimentally determined survival potentials of boll weevils passing through the various subprocesses of the gin, from which one can calculate the risk of a live boll weevil reaching any point in the process.

Grass herbage (n = 4) was cut after 3 or 5 weeks of regrowth and received a low (20 kg N/ha) or a high (90 kg N/ha) fertilization rate. Grass silage (n = 6) received a low (65 kg N/ha) or high (150 kg N/ha) fertilization rate and was harvested at early (c 2000 kg DM/ha), mid (harvested 13 d later), or late (harvested 34 d later) maturity stage and ensiled in <b>big</b> <b>bales.</b> All grasses were incubated in the rumen of three lactating rumen-cannulated Holstein Friesian cows. Rumen degradation characteristics of organic matter (OM), nitrogen (N) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) {{and the extent of}} effective degradation (ED) were evaluated. In grass herbage, NDF content varied between 390 and 454 g/kg DM and N content between 12. 1 and 25. 8 g/kg DM. In grass silage, NDF content varied between 438 and 593 g/kg DM and N content between 13. 4 and 34. 8 g/kg DM. In general, rumen degradation of grass herbage and grass silage decreased with increased maturity, and increased with increased fertilization rate. Significant interaction between maturity and fertilization rate was observed for ED of OM, N and NDF, except for ED of N in grass herbage. These results indicate that the effect of the rate of N fertilization on degradation of nutrients in the rumen of dairy cattle and on nutritional value depends on the grass maturity stage...|$|R

A module builder {{is used to}} compress the seed cotton into large rectangular modules that allow in-field storage until being transported to a ginning facility, where the fiber and seed are separated and cleaned. On-board module-building systems are now being used on harvesters and offer virtually continuous harvesting, without the need to transfer seed cotton to a separate module builder. With their smaller size and shape, these packages could possibly be transported more economically by loading multiple packages on a truck. However, their density is similar to traditional modules, so any transport advantage is minimal. Transportation costs could be reduced significantly by creating higher-density cotton packages at harvest. Compression of seed cotton to levels observed with module-building systems has not proven to damage cottonseed, but some {{research has shown that}} higher compression levels could cause damage. Moisture content and storage duration may also influence the effect of compression on the seed. The objective of this research was to quantify the effects of these factors, individually and in combination, on cottonseed across two cotton varieties. Humidity chambers were used to achieve desired experimental seed cotton moisture levels. A miniature <b>bale</b> <b>press</b> (16. 6 x 8. 3 x 6. 2 in.) was used to compress bales of seed cotton to different densities.
