50|$|The screen scroll {{centrifuge}} has {{an advantage}} {{of having a}} driven scroll helical conveyor which gives a small differential speed relative to the conical basket. The helical conveyor is installed in the centrifuge to control the transport of the incoming feed, allowing the residence time of the solids in the basket to be increased giving enhanced process performance. Moreover, the helical conveyor and conical basket sections are designed in certain angle of 10°, 15° and 20° being common such that solid particles are dragged on the conveyor along the cone towards the discharge point. As a result, there is no formation of even solids layer but form piles of triangular section {{in front of the}} blades of the conveyor. The residence time within screen scroll centrifuge is typically about 4 to 15 seconds which is longer than normal simpler conical <b>basket</b> <b>centrifuge.</b> This permits a sufficient interaction time between wash liquids and cake. However, the presence of the conveyor causes crystals breakage and abrasion problem as well as the formation of uneven solids layer which can lead to poor washing. This can be controlled by conveyor speed.|$|E

40|$|CSIRO/Novatech Consulting {{have been}} {{developing}} air purging {{as a new}} way of reducing the moisture content of coarse coal products from vibrating <b>basket</b> <b>centrifuges.</b> The process involves injecting a turbulent stream of high velocity air, via an air knife manifold, through the coal bed as it traverses the <b>centrifuge</b> <b>basket.</b> This paper describes the results obtained when the process was trialled in a commercial scale centrifuge, following successful previous bench and pilot scale work reported previously. Five manifolds of different shapes and sizes were tested. The best results were achieved with units of square cross-section, located close to the outlet edge of the basket. Depending on air speed, product moisture was reduced by between 0. 7 and 0. 9 wt% at a confidence level exceeding 95 %. The best results approached closely the 1. 0 wt% moisture reduction target which had been adopted as the project objective. Air purging had no significant effect on the content or size distribution of the solids in the centrate. Increasing air speed led to larger moisture reductions. Higher air speeds were needed compared with previous pilot scale work probably due to the thicker beds encountered in the full scale centrifuge. Despite the higher air speed, the actual air usage (cfm/t of coal) was much more efficient at full scale, being less than half that at pilot scale. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

30|$|Prepared {{fish were}} {{subjected}} to deboning using a deboner with a hole diameter of 3 to 4  mm. The mince obtained was then washed with cold distilled water (5 °C to 8 °C) {{for the first and}} second washing using a mince/water ratio of 1 : 3 (w/v). For the third washing, cold washing media, 0.45 % NaCl containing CaCl 2 or MgCl 2 at different levels (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20  mM), were used. The mixture was stirred gently for 3  min, and the washed mince was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth.

Because of its great water absorbing capabilities, it presents gelling, stabilizing and thickening properties. Pectin is widely used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The purpose of this project is to design a plant {{for the production of}} pectin, operating in batch. Generally, the raw materials used are vegetable residues of juice factories, and, for this work waste of apple, peach, orange and lemon have been selected as raw materials. The plant to be designed should have a production capability of 6 t/year of pectin. The production process of pectin consists basically in a prior selection and washing of raw material; solid-liquid extraction (at 70 °C and in acid medium) to solubilize pectin; and filtering of solid waste; precipitation of pectin by addition of ethanol; solid-liquid separation of the precipitated pectin; and, finally, drying and milling and proceeds to final conditioning. The units that are designed for the process are: opened stirred and jacketed tank for extraction, filter press to separate solid waste, closed stirred and jacketed tank for precipitation of pectin, <b>basket</b> <b>centrifuge</b> for solid pectin separation, and tray dryer to remove the humidity (alcohol and water) ...|$|E
40|$|Air purging {{is a new}} way of {{reducing}} the moisture content of coarse coal (i. e. within the 50 - 0. 5 mm size range) products from vibrating <b>basket</b> <b>centrifuges.</b> The process, which involves injecting a turbulent stream of high velocity air through the coal bed as it traverses the <b>centrifuge</b> <b>basket,</b> has recently been shown to work at commercial scale. This paper describes some background modelling and experimental work that was undertaken to enhance understanding of the technique. The most critical variables affecting air purging are the speed of the air exiting the bed and the height of the bed itself. Both parameters were characterised at commercial scale through a combination of experimental tests and modelling. These data were then used to predict the flow rate of the air into the bed and also the pressure drop across it. The predicted values agreed well with the experimental data. Based on this information it was then possible to establish that the operating costs of air purging would be of the order of A$ 0. 02 - 0. 03 /ton of coal, considerably less than the financial gains associated with drier products. The next stage of assessing air purging would involve prolonged trials in different plant situations to resolve the remaining engineering issues. The technology is now sufficiently well understood for these trials to be approached with some confidence. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|One {{stage in}} the {{processing}} of sheep and lamb skins in New Zealand freezing works is the removal {{of water from the}} woolly skin after washing. Neither of the two systems used at present to achieve this reduction in moisture content is entirely satisfactory. Passing the skin between pressure rollers often results in damage to the skin or wool. Batch centrifuging in manually loaded and unloaded "hydros" (<b>basket</b> <b>centrifuges)</b> involves high labour and capital costs. Initial investigation into alternative methods of water removal indicated that an automatic continuous centrifuging system could be economically preferable to the existing processes. This thesis describes the design and development of machines constructed with the ultimate aim of producing a commercial continuous centrifuge capable of automatically effecting the required water removal. Two full size machines were designed and constructed. The second machine was developed to the stage where reliable skin control was achieved, and the principle of operation could form the basis for the design of a successful commercial machine. The effect on wool moisture content of variations in centrifuging parameters was investigated...|$|R

40|$|O processo de fritura de alimentos há muito tempo é empregado domesticamente e também vem sendo uma das maneiras de conservação de alimentos empregadas na indústria de alimentos. Este projeto, que visou estudar as melhores condições para a fritura da maçã, incluiu o estudo da desidratação osmótica e da secagem com ar quente como pré-tratamentos, o uso de coberturas comestíveis, a centrifugação do produto após a fritura, além de estudar a tecnologia de fritura sob vácuo. Os ensaios em pressão atmosférica foram conduzidos na fritadeira Croydon - F 25. Na otimização dos parâmetros tempo e temperatura do processo de fritura em óleo de palma foi utilizada a metodologia de superfície de esposta, tendo por base um planejamento fatorial em dois níveis, visando a minimização da incorporação de óleo e da alteração da cor. Obtiveramse chips vindos da fritura de maçã parcialmente desidratada em estufa (umidade de 50 %) e da maçã osmoticamente desidratada. Para a validação foram definidas as condições de fritura de 145 oC/ 220 segundos e 155 oC/ 180 segundos para a maçã parcialmente desidratada em estufa e osmoticamente desidratada, respectivamente. Ambos os chips obtidos apresentaram valores de Aa inferiores a 0, 6 sendo, portanto, considerados microbiologicamente estáveis. Contudo, apresentaram teores de óleo elevados, em torno de 30 %. Como revestimento comestível utilizaram-se coberturas formadas a partir de soluções de 1 e 2 % de alginato de sódio ou 1, 2 e 4 % de pectina de baixo grau de metoxilação associados a íons cálcio, obtendo-se 12 % de lipídeos nos chips representando uma redução da ordem de 60 %. A centrifugação a 1500 rpm após o processo de fritura em centrífuga de cesto mostrou-se eficiente apenas para remoção do óleo em excesso na superfície, não sendo eficiente para remover o óleo incorporado. Na avaliação sensorial utilizando testes afetivos para estimar a preferência e aceitação dos chips foram avaliados os atributos aparência, cor, aroma, sabor, textura e impressão global. Os chips sem coberturas armazenados em sacos de embalagem flexível metalizada foram submetidos à análise sensorial mensal até 120 dias de armazenamento. A aprovação dos provadores para todos os atributos foi {{superior}} a 50 % até 90 dias; a partir de então, para o atributo textura apresentou-se inferior a 50 %. A maior parte das médias de aceitação dos chips de maçã situou-se na escala hedônica entre as categorias "Gostei ligeiramente" e "Gostei moderadamente" com exceção do atributo sabor da amostra de chips com cobertura de pectina e para os atributos aparência, cor e impressão global da amostra sem cobertura que apresentaram-se um pouco superiores a 7 : situandose entre as categorias "Gostei moderadamente" e "Gostei muito". A perda de água, na forma de vapor, ocorrida durante o processo de fritura, mostrou-se mais correlacionada ao gradiente de transferência de calor (diferença entre a temperatura de trabalho do óleo e o ponto de ebulição da água) do que à aplicação de pressão reduzida. Utilizaram-se maçã sem pré-tratamento e osmoticamente impregnada para verificar a influência do teor de sólidos na incorporação de óleo. Nas maçãs osmoticamente impregnadas, o teor de água e de óleo não foram afetados pela redução de pressão; para as maçãs sem prétratamento, o teor de água foi reduzido em cerca de 50 % pela aplicação de vácuo e o teor de óleo foi reduzido em cerca de 25 %. The frying {{process has}} been used domestically and in the food industry {{as a way to}} preserve food. The main purpose of this work was to study the best conditions to fry apples, It including the use of osmotic dehydration and hot air drying as pre-treatments, the use of edible coatings, centrifugation of the product after frying and the study of vaccum frying technology. All experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure in a Croydon - F 25 fryer. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the time and temperature parameters of the frying process in palm oil, based on a factorial plan at two levels, seeking to minimize oil incorporation and color alterations. Although all the mathematical models were statistically significant, it was only possible to develop chips from apples partially dehydrated in na oven (moisture contents of 50 %) and osmotically dehydrated. For validation, the frying conditions were defined as 145 oC/ 220 seconds for oven partially dehydrated apples and 155 oC/ 180 seconds for osmotically dehydrated ones. Chips obtained from both processes presented low Aw values (betow for 0. 6), therefore being considered microbiologically stable, although they presented high oil contents of about 30 %. As edible coatings, coverings made of 2 % sodium alginate solutions or 2 % and 4 % of pectin with a low degree of methylation associated to the calcium íons were used. With the poly-saccharides solutions chips with 12 % lipid were obtained, representing a reduction of about 60 %. Centrifugation at 1500 rpm after the frying process, using a <b>basket</b> <b>centrifuge</b> was efficient in removing excess oil from the surface, but not to remove internal oil. In the sensory evaluation affective tests to estimate chip preference and acceptance were used, evaluating the following attributes: appearance, color, aroma, flavor, texture and overall impression. The non covered chips stored in flexible metalized packages were submitted to a sensoryl analysis until 120 days. Approval rates for all attributes were greater than 50 % for all samples up to 90 days of storage, but after this, the texture approval rates were less than 50 %. In most cases the acceptance averages for the apple chips were between 6 and 7 for each attribute, representing the categories " I Liked slightly "and " I Liked moderately " on the hedonic scale, {{with the exception of the}} attribute flavors for chip samples with a covering of pectin and the atributtes of appearance, color and global impression for the samples with not covering, which were above 7, representing the categories "Liked moderately" and "Liked a lot". The results obtained in vacuum system suggested that the loss of water vapor during the frying process was more correlated to the heat transfer gradient (difference between the working oil temperature and the boiling of the water point) than to the application of reduced pressure. The study of the effect of a pressure reduction on oil incorporation was elaborated so that the temperature was constant and the pressure difference was the only variable in the experiment. In nature and osmotically impregnated apples were studied to verify the influence of the solids content on oil incorporation. After frying (180 seconds), osmotically impregnated apples presented similar water contents after treatment at atmospheric and reduced pressures. For apples in natura different values were observed. Concerning the final oil content, no significant differences were found among the impregnated apple samples between those treated at atmospheric and at reduced pressures (around 25 %). For in nature apples different oil contents were observed...|$|E

It satisfies the Hall–Onsager's relation and is a non-symmetric tensor. The present study aims at quantifying more precisely the Coriolis effects in a porous medium. For this purpose we performed some 3 D numerical simulations for the flow through rotating periodic array of spheres. Our numerical results clearly show the influence of the Coriolis effects on the permeability at large Ekman number e << Ek– 1 << 1 and Ekman number O(l). These results are analyzed according to the geometrical properties of the packings of spheres: soild volume fraction, arrangement and size. Under particular conditions, we finally show that in the first approximation the flow through rotating granular media can be described by a modified Darcy's law including a “macroscopic Coriolis force” which brakes and deviates the flow...|$|R
40|$|International audiencehis {{paper is}} aimed towards {{investigating}} the filtration law of an incompressible viscous Newtonian fluid through a rigid non-inertial porous medium (e. g. a porous medium {{placed in a}} <b>centrifuge</b> <b>basket).</b> The filtration law is obtained by upscaling the flow equations at the pore scale. The upscaling technique is the homogenization method of multiple scale expansions which rigorously gives the macroscopic behaviour and the effective properties without any prerequisite on {{the form of the}} macroscopic equations. The derived filtration law is similar to Darcy's law, but the tensor of permeability presents the following remarkable properties: it depends upon the angular velocity of the porous matrix, it verifies Hall-Onsager's relationship and it is a non-symmetric tensor. We thus deduce that, under rotation, an isotropic porous medium leads to a non-isotropic effective permeability. In this paper, we present the results of numerical simulations of the flow through rotating porous media. This allows us to highlight the deviations of the flow due to Coriolis effects at both the microscopic scale (i. e. the pore scale), and the macroscopic scale (i. e. the sample scale). The above results confirm that for an isotropic medium, phenomenological laws already proposed in the literature fails at reproducing three-dimensional Coriolis effects in all types of pores geometry. We show that Coriolis effects may lead to significant variations of the permeability measured during centrifuge tests when the inverse Ekman number Ek(- 1) is 0 (1). These variations are estimated to be less than 5 % if Ek(- 1) < 0. 2, which is the case of classical geotechnical centrifuge tests. We finally conclude by showing that available experimental data from tests carried out in centrifuges arenot sufficient to determining the effective tensor of permeability of rotating porous media...|$|R
