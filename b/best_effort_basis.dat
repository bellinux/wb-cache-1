Differently from most previous paper which focus on the support of quality of service (QoS) requirements, we study the tuning of the access parameters for the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> traffic. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we discuss the coexistence between legacy DCF and EDCA stations, since, for guaranteeing the backward compatibility, the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> service class defined in EDCA should correspond to the legacy DCF.

We propose an effective algorithm able to maximize the system throughput, by adapting the minimum contention window to the network contention level.

40|$|Over the years, Internet {{users have}} {{exhibited}} an increasing demand for sharing {{information in a}} variety of application domains, and a large number of applications have emerged. Despite advances in Internet technologies, the following remain key challenges: (a) dynamicity of user context (e. g., locations and activities) causes rapid changes in terms of what to share and who to share with; (b) diverse performance requirements of information sharing applications (in terms of reliability, timeliness, accuracy and efficiency); (c) limitations in infrastructure (e. g., unreliable yet changing networks and resourced limited end devices). These challenges are further aggravated by large number of mobile users distributed over a wide geography. In this thesis, we study information sharing at societal scale involving a large group of people across a large geography. We exploit the knowledge of geographical and social relationships between users to address the above challenges. We adopt a middleware approach that is resilient to the heterogeneity of the communication environments (i. e., networks and devices) and offers adaptive services to a verity of applications. We scope our work along 2 dimensions. Firstly, along the dimension of system layers our focus is on two layers: 1) the information layer - what to share: determine specificity of contents and accurately target information consumers and providers. 2) the dissemination layer - how to share: determine dissemination mechanisms to deliver information from its source to targeted receivers to meet the performance goals. Secondly, along the dimension of timing constraints we consider two classes of applications: 1) instant information sharing and 2) delay-tolerant information sharing applications. We develop sharing techniques for multiple use cases. Specifically, for instant sharing we design two systems. At the information layer, we propose and design DYNATOPS, a dynamic topic based publish/subscribe middleware to efficiently keep trak of the large scale dynamic information interests of users, and provide efficient event notifications to subscribers. DYNATOPS organizes pub/sub brokers into a structured overlay. To adapt to the subscription dynamics and to maintain efficient event notifications, it strategically and moderately reposition pub/sub users on brokers and reposition brokers on the overlay. At the dissemination layer, we propose and design GSFord, a reliable notification middleware that aims to provide timely and reliable instant information dissemination in extreme situations (e. g., catastrophic disasters). GSFord builds robust geo-aware P 2 P overlays and provides reliable storage of geo-social information of users under extreme regional failures. It reliably delivers messages to unfailing recipients who are either geographically or socially correlated to the event and exploits a targeted social diffusion through diverse out-of-band channels to reach those in failed regions on a <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>basis.</b> For delay-tolerant information sharing, at the information layer, we propose and implement SmartSource, a crowdsourcing based mobile Question & Answer (Q&A) middleware. SmartSource aims to provide mobile information seekers with timely, trustworthy and accurate answers while ensuring that information providers are not inappropriately burdened. It takes advantage of both static and dynamic context and semantics from mobile users (e. g., geolocation, social network, expertise/interest, device sensor profiles, battery level) to identify sources of information (i. e., providers) that are trusted by the user and accurate enough for the questions at hand. At the dissemination layer, we propose O 2 SM middleware that aims to enable mobile users to access to online social media contents anytime anyplace without requiring to be online all the time. We develop the middleware to (i) rank the social media streams by estimating probability that a given user views a given content item and (ii) invest the limited resources (network, energy and storage) on prefetching only those social media streams that {{are most likely to be}} watched when mobile devices have good Internet connectivity.

To accomplish this we employ a simple two-step procedure. In the first step the spectrum resources are allocated to primary stations to maximize the QoS for the primary users.

30|$|Additionally, the {{organization}} {{may be interested}} in ensuring that its requests, specific to the applications deployed on the infrastructure, are completed in a timely manner. One way to accomplish this is to introduce SLAs for the workload provided by cloud users to allow user requests to specify an earliest start time and deadline for the requests. These types of requests are also referred to as advance reservation (AR) requests in the literature [5]. AR requests are important features of clouds and distributed systems [6]. The different properties of an AR request are described in more detail in “Performance evaluation” section. Associating a deadline with requests processed by a cloud has been considered in several works (see [7] and [6] for example) and is receiving {{a great deal of attention}} from researchers. The authors of [8] and [9] evaluate auto-scaling mechanisms which consider both user performance requirements and pricing for a workload characterized by jobs with deadlines. Note that in addition to jobs with deadlines, the technique discussed in this paper can handle jobs without deadlines referred to as On Demand (OD) request by associating an arbitrarily large deadline with the respective requests that is larger than the deadline of any AR. An OD request is executed on a <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> <b>basis</b> [10]. Moreover, the matchmaking and scheduling algorithms used in this paper handles requests for which the arrival time and the earliest start time coincide by setting the earliest start time to be equal to the time of arrival of the request. Whether or not a request is an OD and irrespective of the earliest start times of requests the system can be profitable. A discussion of profitability and the conditions that need to be satisfied for achieving a profit are discussed in “Profitability and cost analysis” section. As indicated earlier, the proposed system is designed to work with both advanced reservation AR and OD requests. In the experiments evaluating the auto-scaling techniques discussed in this paper, a workload comprising 80 % AR and 20 % OD requests has been used. The auto-scaling techniques described in the paper work with any given mix of ARs and ODs including a workload with 100 % OD requests. Without deadlines, the proposed system will accept all the requests and schedule them on a <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> <b>basis.</b>|$|E
