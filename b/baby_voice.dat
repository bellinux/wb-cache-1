60|$|But the pleasantest sight {{the three}} gossips {{saw was the}} man with Baby Nan on his arm and Will at his side, playing in the once dreary nursery. How they laughed and danced! for Will was up from his bed at last, and hopped nimbly on his crutches, knowing that soon even they would be unneeded. Little Nan was as plump and rosy as a baby should be, and babbled like a brook, as the man went to and fro, cradling her in his strong arms, feeling as if his own little {{daughter}} had come back {{when he heard the}} <b>baby</b> <b>voice</b> call him father.|$|E

It was a pretty sight to see the mother with her year-old {{daughter}} out among the fresh, green things: the little golden head bobbing here and there like a stray sunbeam; the <b>baby</b> <b>voice</b> telling sweet, unintelligible stories to bird and bee and butterfly; or the small creature fast asleep in a basket under a rose-bush, swinging in a hammock from a tree, or in Bran's keeping, rosy, vigorous, and sweet with sun and air, and the wholesome influence of a wise and tender love.|$|E

Happy faces made perpetual sunshine round the little Sylvia, but to none was she so dear a boon as to her young god-mother. Jessie became a trifle jealous of [...] "old Sylvia," [...] as she now called herself, for she almost lived in baby's nursery; hurrying over in time to assist at its morning ablutions, hovering about its crib when it slept, daily discovering beauties invisible even to its mother's eyes, and working early and late on dainty garments, rich in the embroidery which she now thanked Prue for teaching her against her will. The touch of the baby hands seemed to heal her sore heart; the sound of the <b>baby</b> <b>voice,</b> even when most unmusical, had a soothing effect upon her nerves; the tender cares its helplessness demanded absorbed her thoughts, and kept her happy in a new world whose delights she had never known till now.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between gender, hostile sexism, benevolent sexism and reactions to a seemingly innocuous genre of sexist humor, the dumb blonde joke. After hearing an audiotaped conversation in which two students swapped dumb blonde jokes, participants high in hostile sexism rated the jokes as more amusing and less offensive than those low in hostile sexism. Among individuals low in hostile sexism, however, benevolent sexism interacted with gender. Specifically, men high in benevolent sexism found the jokes significantly more amusing and less offensive than either women in the same group or men low in both hostile and benevolent sexism. This study replicates and extends previous research examining the relationship between hostile sexism and the enjoyment of sexist humor, and underscores the possibility that benevolent sexism may represent qualitatively distinct attitudes for men and women. The fifties blonde was sold as a sex kitten, but MarilynMon-roe’s perfected dumb act is more childlike than animal. The Patron Saint of peroxide {{is the one who}} set up a new stereo-type for blondes, a combination of innocence and knowing sensuality, the pale golden hair of a child [...] . in glaring con-trast to the voluptuous curves of a grownwoman, the lisping <b>baby</b> <b>voice</b> in opposition to the seductive behaviour...|$|E
