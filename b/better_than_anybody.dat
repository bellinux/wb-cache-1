However, the Asian Crisis contagion which started from Thailand and Korea started affecting the Philippines. This prompted the Philippine economy to plunge into continuous devaluation and very risky ventures, resulting in property busts and a negative growth rate. The remarkable feat of the administration, however, {{was that it was}} able to withstand the contagion effect of the Asian Crisis <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> else in the neighboring countries. Most important in the administration was that it made clear the important tenets of reform, which included economic liberalization, stronger institutional foundations for development, redistribution, and political reform.|$|E

In August 1999, Nintendo added the title to its best-selling Player's Choice collection, while the PC version was re-released as a part of the LucasArts Archive Series in May 2001. Rogue Squadrons retail success was not anticipated by the game's producer Julian Eggebrecht, who said that the game sold [...] "about 100 times <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> expected".

500|$|Bure's playing style {{reflected}} the speed, skill and puck possession that was prominent in Soviet Union hockey programs. The most prevalent {{aspects of his}} game were his skating speed, agility, and acceleration, which earned him his nickname the [...] "Russian Rocket". He {{was able to use}} his quickness to separate himself from defenders, to retrieve pucks before the opposition could in all zones of the ice, and to skate the length of the ice on many occasions. In a 1993 poll of NHL coaches conducted by hockey writer Bob McKenzie, Bure was named the league's best skater with eight of twenty-one votes, twice as many votes as any other player. One coach noted: [...] "Bure has the best combination of speed, agility and balance ... He can also use change of speed <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> in the league right now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alvar {{has been}} criticized by his contemporaries for an overly nationalistic and {{colonialist}} viewpoint on the Spanish language. In his final year {{as director of the}} Real Academia Española, Alvar responded harshly to the European Commission (an institution of the European Union) after it requested that Spain revoke its law that all typewriters, computers and printers sold domestically include the tilde, a Spanish diacritical mark. Alvar declared that [...] "he tilde is our tradition and our identity." [...] He also received criticism for a statement he made in 1991 about indigenous languages, stating, [...] "Mexico knew <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> else the value of having a language that unifies, that liberates the indigenous communities from their backwardness and misery...the path to freedom runs through hispanization." ...|$|E

James Reston, writing for The New York Times, said that [...] "Dr. King touched all the themes of the day, only <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> else. He was full of the symbolism of Lincoln and Gandhi, and the cadences of the Bible. He was both militant and sad, and he sent the crowd away feeling that the long journey had been worthwhile." [...] Reston also noted that the event [...] "was better covered by television and the press than any event here since President Kennedy's inauguration", and opined that [...] "it will be a long time before [...] forgets the melodious and melancholy voice of the Rev.

[...] An article in The Boston Globe by Mary McGrory reported that King's speech [...] "caught the mood" [...] and [...] "moved the crowd" [...] of the day [...] "as no other" [...] speaker in the event. Marquis Childs of The Washington Post wrote that King's speech [...] "rose above mere oratory". [...] An article in the Los Angeles Times commented that the [...] "matchless eloquence" [...] displayed by King—"a supreme orator" [...] of [...] "a type so rare as almost to be forgotten in our age"—put to shame the advocates of segregation by inspiring the [...] "conscience of America" [...] with the justice of the civil-rights cause.|$|E

Ron Garan is my flight engineer, a colonel in the Air Force. This is going to be his first time in space as well as is Karen’s and Ken’s and he’s doing three spacewalks.

And then I have Aki Hoshide, our Japanese crew member, who grew up in New Jersey kind of like me. That’s an interesting thing about our flight—we have four people from New Jersey on the mission. I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for. All through our training he’s been very much focused on the Japanese lab, making sure it’s ready to go, making sure we’re completely trained on the systems and everything we have to do.
