Before spring arrived, Wickersham published the first {{newspaper in the}} settlement—the Fairbanks Miner—on a typewriter. It sold seven copies at $5 per copy. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> the walls of Wickersham's courthouse were going up, dissatisfied miners were leaving the area. Hundreds left on rafts going downriver or steamers going to Dawson City. By June 1903, cabins on city lots were selling {{for as little as}} $10. Meanwhile, Barnette sold two-thirds of his store to the Alaska Commercial Company and arranged {{for the establishment of a}} post office at his settlement.|$|E
5|$|With the NIE reports {{suggesting}} {{the existence of}} the gap Gaither predicted, near panic broke out in military circles. In response, the US began to rush its own ICBM efforts, centered on the SM-65 Atlas. These missiles would be less susceptible to attack by Soviet ICBMs than their existing bomber fleet, especially in future versions which would be launched from underground silos. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> Atlas was rushed, it appeared there would be a missile gap; NIE estimates made during the late 1950s suggested the Soviets would have significantly more ICBMs than the US between 1959 and 1963, at which point US production would finally catch up.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 19th century, the anti-Brahmin Tamil leaders had {{stated that the}} non-Brahmin Tamils were the {{original}} inhabitants of the Tamil-speaking region. The Brahmins, on the other hand, were described not only as oppressors, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> a foreign power, on par with the British colonial rulers.|$|E

25|$|During the Renaissance, wealthy {{cities in}} {{northern}} Italy — Florence and Venice in particular — were renowned for their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a considerable {{part of the}} male population and constructed along the classical pattern of Greece and Rome. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> many of the male population were engaging in same-sex relationships, the authorities, {{under the aegis of}} the Officers of the Night court, were prosecuting, fining, and imprisoning a good portion of that population.|$|E

25|$|In the 1590s Essex was {{especially}} popular in London, {{where he was}} considered a pillar of Protestantism. At {{the height of the}} Anglo-Spanish war (1585–1604) he pushed an offensive strategy, supporting the Dutch rebels and French Huguenots against their Catholic enemy. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> he championed maritime attacks on Spain and outright war against the Irish rebel O'Neill, the broad alliance against Spain was broken by the decision of King Henry IV of France to sue for peace.|$|E
25|$|These {{suggestions}} {{were followed}} in 1946–47, by similar calls by the Brotherhood, {{referring to the}} deterioration of the main portal and sacristy. In addition, there were references to deteriorating windows, falling stucco from the vaulted-ceiling and degradation of the skylight in the choir. <b>But,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> the DGEMN interevened in 1947, the church's condition worsened the following year, with rainfall that invaded the church, and a broken pipe in the sacristy, that resulted in the rotting of the wood floors that had to be replaced.|$|E
25|$|On 15 September 1821, Delacroix {{wrote to}} his friend Raymond Soulier {{that he wanted to}} make a {{reputation}} for himself by painting a scene from the war between the Ottomans and the Greeks, and have this painting displayed at the Salon. At this time Delacroix was not famous, and had yet to paint a canvas that was to be hung for public display. In the event, he decided to paint his Dante and Virgil in Hell, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> this painting was revealed to the public in April 1822, the atrocities at Chios were being meted out in full force. In May 1823, Delacroix committed to paint a picture about the massacre.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 15th century, King D. John II {{donated the}} lands of Castelo Melhor to João Fernandes Cabral for 4000 crowns for his {{marriage}} to Joana Coutinho. In the following century, many of the important noble families became affixed to the alcalde of the castles, and the fortress fell {{into the hands of the}} Cabral, whom were responsible for the alcalde of Belmonte. <b>But,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> Belmonte became the seat of the their power, resulting the construction of their seat, in Castelo Melhor, little remained. Around this time (1527), Castelo Melhor was mentioned in the Cadastro da População do Reino (Kingdoms Population Cadastre) as being a part of the town of Almendra. In 1584, it was elevated to the status of seat of the countship, in favor of Rui Mendes de Vasconcelos.|$|E
25|$|The {{other two}} groups of protesters, however, {{maintained}} their positions for weeks to come. The art gallery closed {{for the duration of}} the occupation, probably more because of the spectacle of shabbily dressed homeless men juxtaposed against the opulent exhibits of high art than for any logistical reasons. The RCPU emphasized discipline among its members in order to win rather than alienate public sympathy, which was evident at the other two locations that remained open to the public. Chief Constable Colonel W. W. Foster attempted to persuade the men to leave, telling them that they had made their point and should now go home. Brodie responded that if they had homes, they would be in them, and invited the colonel to arrest them. They offered to submit to arrest peacefully, and continued to do so {{for the duration of the}} occupation. Foster refused, and instead sought to manage the situation rather than clog the local prison with 1000 demonstrators and giving them the publicity they sought. The attorney-general agreed with Colonel Foster that the strikers would likely vacate on their own in a matter of days. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> the strike dragged on from days into weeks, the police stood by awaiting orders before proceeding with an eviction. Colonel Foster had earned a reputation for diplomacy with the unemployed during the 1935 strike, which he appeared to be cultivating again in 1938. Behind the scenes, however, Foster was plotting with politicians and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to evacuate the post office and art gallery.|$|E

500|$|Alberta had {{implemented}} prohibition in 1916 as {{the result}} of a referendum supported by the powerful United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) lobby group. [...] By the time Stewart took office, it was becoming apparent that the policy was not being universally complied with: Conservative MLA George Douglas Stanley alleged that judges were often hungover when they sat in judgment of those accused of violating liquor laws, and Cross's replacement as Attorney-General, John Boyle, admitted that in his estimation 65% of the province's male population broke the Prohibition Act. [...] In 1921 the government realized profits of $800,000 on alcohol legally sold for [...] "medicinal" [...] purposes, and Boyle estimated bootleggers' profits at nine times that figure. [...] Stewart blamed the problems on insufficient public support for the law, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> he did so it was clear that there was not enough support to repeal it.|$|E
500|$|Before {{giving his}} decision, Tyndareus bound all the suitors to his fateful oath: should anyone ever take his {{daughter}} by force, {{all those who}} had wooed her must exact vengeance upon her abductor. To this all the suitors readily agreed, each believing {{that he would be}} given Helen's hand. At this point the Catalogue of Suitors has come to a close, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> Menelaus' success is reported, the poet introduces Achilles because of his status as the greatest hero of the Trojan saga and his central role in Zeus's plan to bring the Heroic Age to a close. With the aid of Agamemnon, Menelaus had given the most bride prices, but were Achilles already of age, he would surely have won Helen's hand, [...] "for neither warlike Menelaus nor any other human on earth would have defeated him". But Achilles was not present, and Menelaus won Helen, who bore Hermione to him.|$|E
500|$|Justin Kanter from Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave a {{positive}} review and {{commented on the}} performances: [...] "Over {{the course of two}} full, uninterrupted hours comes an abundance of grandiose sets and effects; a voluminous line-up of dancers; precisely engineered sound and sequence; and sharply produced, celebrity-studded video clips. [...] Unquestionably, it’s Madonna and company’s actual show — the entire spectacle of song, dance, style, and attitude — that make the Sticky & Sweet Tour an invigorating and highly memorable happening." [...] However, he felt that the performances of [...] "Borderline" [...] (1984) and [...] "Human Nature" [...] were disappointing. Ben Kaplan from Canada.com said [...] "Sticky & Sweet is a document of a woman in her fifties who actually started peaking after most people thought she was through. Madonna doesn't speak with a British accent on her new record. But even if she did, it wouldn't really have mattered: Most of the stage banter is drowned out by the crowd's roar." [...] He listed the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] (1985) as a highlight of the tour. Tony clayton-Lea from The Irish Times said [...] "Madonna has the experience to know what works and what doesn’t. It is this that makes Sticky Sweet such an interesting proposition: a superbly shot movie of the 'four-act' show that blends muscle with music, depth with deftness." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said [...] "Since so much of the tour depended on overblown spectacle, Sticky & Sweet Tour is better experienced as a video instead of a CD – <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> a video this doesn’t rank among the best Madonna live albums, as there’s too much precision and not enough inspiration in the whole show." ...|$|E
