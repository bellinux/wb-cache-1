30|$|Simulating {{the process}} of cosmological {{structure}} formation with enough resolution to determine galaxy morphologies requires an enormous dynamic range in space and time. Star formation (SF) is concentrated in dense gas clouds the size {{of just a few}} parsecs, while the assembly of galaxies happens over <b>billion</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> driven by large scale structures extending over megaparsecs.|$|R
30|$|The {{rheology}} of icy satellites {{is similar}} to terrestrial rocks although for different range of temperature and pressure. The uppermost layer (’lithosphere’) is elastic for small deformation and brittle for large deformations. It means that mountains on the surface could exist for <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b> The medium below the lithosphere is also solid but for very slow geologic processes it behaves like a viscous fluid.|$|R
5|$|One {{of the key}} aims of {{the astronomers}} who {{designed}} the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study distant galaxies {{to a level of}} detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the atmosphere, Hubble avoids atmospheric airglow allowing it to take more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good adaptive optics correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from spherical aberration when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because light takes <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows {{a better understanding of how}} they evolve.|$|E
5|$|The {{companion}} star is a dense {{white dwarf}} star. This category of stellar object {{has reached the}} end of its evolutionary life span and is no longer generating energy through nuclear fusion. Instead, under normal circumstances, a white dwarf will steadily radiate away its excess energy, mainly stored heat, growing cooler and dimmer over the course of many <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{more massive}} the star, the shorter its lifespan, {{primarily}} because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, {{causing them to}} burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
50|$|The park {{is located}} on the southern-eastern area of the Ingul block of the Ukrainian {{crystalline}} shield. Here limestones, clays and sands lie on Precambrian formations - gneisses and granites which outcrop in some places along the valleys of the river Ingul and its feeders the Sagaydak and the Berezivka creating unique attractive landscapes, the isotopic age of which is determined by geologists to be 1.8-2.2 <b>billion</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b>|$|R

5|$|Thermal {{modeling}} of Saturn's moon Dione, {{which is similar}} to Ariel in size, density, and surface temperature, suggests that solid state convection could have lasted in Ariel's interior for <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> and that temperatures in excess of 173 K (the melting point of aqueous ammonia) may have persisted near its surface for several hundred million years after formation, and near a billion years closer to the core.|$|E
5|$|Venus {{may have}} formed from the solar nebula with a {{different}} rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred {{over the course of}} <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} located in a region of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} advantageous {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, have the potential to severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the potential to sterilize an entire region of a galaxy for <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation, triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E

50|$|This {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} by noting that atomic clocks at differing altitudes (and thus different gravitational potential) will eventually show different times. The effects detected in such Earth-bound experiments are extremely small, with differences being measured in nanoseconds. Relative to the earth's age in <b>billion</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> the earth's core is effectively 2.5 years younger than the surface leading to a paradox of alignment with the celestial sphere due to {{the rotation of the}} earth. Demonstrating larger effects would require greater distances from the Earth or a larger gravitational source.|$|R

5|$|<b>Billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> ago, beings {{called the}} Guardians of the Universe used the green essence of willpower {{to create an}} intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps. They divided the {{universe}} into 3600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, Abin Sur of Sector 2814, defeated the malevolent being Parallax and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the desolate planet Ryut. In the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison after becoming strengthened by an encounter with crash survivors on the planet, feeding on their fear to gain strength before pursuing and nearly killing Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth where he commands his power ring to find a worthy successor.|$|E
5|$|Haumea's moons are {{unusual in}} a number of ways. They are thought to be part of its {{extended}} collisional family, which formed <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> ago from icy debris after a large impact disrupted Haumea's ice mantle. Hiʻiaka, the larger, outermost moon, has large amounts of pure water ice on its surface, which is rare among Kuiper belt objects. Namaka, about one tenth the mass, has an orbit with surprising dynamics: it is unusually eccentric and appears to be greatly influenced by the larger satellite.|$|E
5|$|In roughly 5billion years, the Sun will {{cool and}} expand outward to many times its current {{diameter}} (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and {{leaving behind a}} stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, {{over the course of}} tens of <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> {{it is likely that the}} Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.|$|E

5|$|Lord Kelvin used {{thermodynamics}} {{to estimate}} the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; {{it was only when}} radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> old. The perception of Earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit, and especially with photographs of Earth returned by the Apollo program.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{the effects}} of the cosmic {{microwave}} background radiation on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the universe. Uniform cooling of the CMB over <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.|$|E
5|$|Oberon's {{accretion}} probably {{lasted for}} several thousand years. The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon's outer layer. The maximum temperature of around 230K was reached at {{the depth of}} about 60km. After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Oberon heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon's crust leading to cracking. The present-day system of canyons may {{be a result of}} this process, which lasted for about 200million years, implying that any endogenous activity from this cause ceased <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> ago.|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} {{universe}} {{appears to be}} one of the increasing complexification viewed on the cosmological scale. The universe began in an exceptionally blind state, a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, as evidence by the near-perfect uniformity of the radiation left over from its fiery birth. The emergence of life on Earth, and the slow evolution of multicellularity, complex behavior and eventually intelligence, is just a small branch of the cosmic creativity that began with the big bang. The elaborate universe did not emerged readymade, but gradually emerged over <b>billion</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> through a long succession of self-organizing and self-complexifying processes. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{impressive}} {{advances in}} our scientific knowledge {{during the last}} century allow {{us to have a}} much better vision of our origin on earth and our situation in the universe than our ancestors. Life probably started on earth around three and a half <b>billion</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> ago, and a genetic memory emerged early, based on an extraordinarily stable molecule, the DNA double helix, bearing a genetic code identical for all living organisms, from bacteria to men. We are thus the heirs of myriads of molecular inventions, which have accumu-lated over millions – sometime <b>billions</b> – <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> Environmental pressure has of course both maintained these inventions and also modulated them over the generations, through the deaths of individuals and sexual reproduc-tion. For the last 30, 000 years, our biological constitution has not changed: a hypertrophic cortical brain, a larynx to speak and a hand to manipulate. But for the last 10, 000 years, another memory has emerged, which make our species quite different from the others: this is the cultural memory which transmits knowledge and societal organisation from generation to genera...|$|R

5|$|One {{short-lived}} gamma ray-emitting {{nuclear isomer}} of technetium—technetium-99m—is used in nuclear medicine {{for a wide}} variety of diagnostic tests. The ground state of this nuclide, technetium-99, is used as a gamma-ray-free source of beta particles. Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of the fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods. Because no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2million years (technetium-98), the 1952 detection of technetium in red giants, which are <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> old, helped to prove that stars can produce heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E
5|$|There {{had also}} been {{criticism}} of the proposed definition of double planet: at present the Moon {{is defined as a}} satellite of the Earth, but over time the Earth-Moon barycenter will drift outwards (see tidal acceleration) and could eventually become situated outside of both bodies. This development would then upgrade the Moon to planetary status at that time, according to the redefinition. The time taken for this to occur, however, would be <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> long after many astronomers expect the Sun to expand into a red giant and destroy both Earth and Moon.|$|E
