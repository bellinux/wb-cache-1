25|$|At the preface, I H Qureshi {{addresses}} the common {{question as to}} whether it is possible to disentangle the history of Pakistan from the history of India. He maintains that although for certain periods Pakistan shares common history with modern day India, there are periods of regional history with local significance that were actually dominated by the events outside the South Asia, especially in Central Asia and Iranian plateau. There have also <b>been</b> <b>times</b> when the region actually became arbiter of the South Asia's historical destiny.|$|E
25|$|With his {{distinctive}} {{look and}} high visibility location, Hana became {{something of a}} local celebrity. In general, he was tolerated by some shopkeepers outside whose premises he sat, and by passers-by, although there have <b>been</b> <b>times</b> of opposition from other shopkeepers. Also, on occasions {{when he decided to}} push the boundaries of offensive behaviour, police officers were likely to be in attendance. As someone who departed from the patterns of normal behaviour, Hana had become a figure of amusement, sympathy, disgust and even some academic interest. During the 2006 Rugby Sevens tournament, one costumed group appeared in dreads and blankets, mimicking his distinctive look.|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} with the food rations {{is that they do}} not {{necessarily}} provide the elements necessary for a basic diet. Furthermore it is insensitive to cultural differences and household needs, leading to refugees considering food assistance as degrading – where they are expected to be grateful for inappropriate provisions. Moreover, when, as is frequent, WFP is unable to provide all of these staples, the calories are distributed through whatever commodity is available. There have <b>been</b> <b>times</b> when all of the 1900 calories (i.e. before it was increased to 2,100) were supplied in maize flour. In 1997, refugees had not received any beans or lentils for eight weeks, their only potential source of protein.|$|E

25|$|Katharine Graham {{wrote in}} her {{autobiography}} Personal History that the newspaper long had a policy of not making endorsements for political candidates. However, since at least 2000, the newspaper has occasionally endorsed Republican politicians, such as Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich. In 2006, it repeated its historic endorsements of every Republican incumbent for Congress in Northern Virginia. There have also <b>been</b> <b>times</b> when the Post has specifically chosen not to endorse any candidate, {{such as in the}} 1988 presidential election when it refused to endorse then-Governor Michael Dukakis or then-Vice President George H. W. Bush. On October 17, 2008, the Post endorsed Barack Obama for President of the United States. On October 25, 2012, the newspaper endorsed the re-election of Barack Obama. On October 21, 2014, the newspaper endorsed 44 Democratic candidates versus 3 Republican candidates for the 2014 elections in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. On October 13, 2016, it endorsed Hillary Clinton for the presidential election of that year.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, EastEnders {{clashed with}} Coronation Street {{for the first}} time. EastEnders won the battle with 8.4 million viewers (41% share) whilst Coronation Street lagged behind with 7.3 million viewers (34 percent share). On 21 September 2004, Louise Berridge, the then {{executive}} producer, quit following criticism of the show. The following day the show received its lowest ever ratings at that time (6.2 million) when ITV scheduled an hour-long episode of Emmerdale against it. Emmerdale was watched by 8.1 million people. The poor ratings motivated the press into reporting viewers were bored with implausible and ill-thought-out storylines. Under new producers, EastEnders and Emmerdale continued to clash at times, and Emmerdale tended {{to come out on}} top, giving EastEnders lower than average ratings. In 2006, EastEnders regularly attracted between 8 and 12 million viewers in official ratings. EastEnders received its second lowest ratings on 17 May 2007, when 4.0 million viewers tuned in. This was also the lowest ever audience share, with just 19.6 percent. This was attributed to a conflicting one hour special episode of Emmerdale on ITV1. However, ratings for the 10pm EastEnders repeat on BBC Three reached an all-time high of 1.4 million. However, there have <b>been</b> <b>times</b> when EastEnders had higher ratings than Emmerdale despite the two going head-to-head.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{introduced}} a fast-paced style of basketball called [...] "Showtime", {{described as a}} mix of [...] "no-look passes off the fastbreak, pin-point alley-oops from halfcourt, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through triple teams." [...] Fellow Lakers guard Michael Cooper said, [...] "There have <b>been</b> <b>times</b> when [...] has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody." [...] Johnson could dominate a game without scoring, running the offense and distributing the ball with flair. In the 1982 NBA Finals, he was named the Finals MVP averaging just 16.2 points, the lowest average of any Finals MVP award recipient in the three-point shot era.|$|E

[...] Frusciante believed that the flexibility of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] has contributed to its success: [...] "A {{lot of the time}} {{that is one of the}} ingredients of a hit; you can hear it over and over and it will still always mean new things, but you do go through cycles." [...] Flea believes that the reason [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had a recent revival in relevancy was due to Frusciante's return to the band from 1998 to 2009 after quitting in 1992. Flea believed that it was vital to have the four members who wrote the track together.|$|E

He spends the next episode, [...] "Death's Door", in a coma, trying to reawaken to reveal the Leviathan's plot. Despite efforts to save him, Bobby flatlines from his injuries; his last word being [...] "idjits" [...] (sic, idiots) to Sam and Dean after passing on a sequence of numbers. The episode ends with a reaper asking Bobby if he is going to become a ghost or move on to the afterlife. It's indicated that he stayed as a ghost to help the boys as there have <b>been</b> <b>times</b> since his death when the information they need inexplicably makes itself known to them, but they were initially unable to confirm or deny Bobby's possible presence. During [...] "Party On, Garth," [...] Sam reveals that he tried to use a talking board to contact him if he is still around, but received no response. However, Garth registers high readings on an EMF detector around Bobby's old flask, and when Dean needed a sword to slay a shojo, it inexplicably slid across the ground to him, leading him to believe that Bobby had helped him. At the end of the episode, Bobby's spirit {{can be seen in the}} brother's motel room, and he is annoyed when Dean comes in, looks right at him, and does not see him, instead grabbing his flask.|$|E
