5|$|Each {{party in}} a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships <b>between</b> species, as well as competition within or <b>between</b> species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race <b>between</b> the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, <b>between</b> exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened <b>between</b> the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E
