5|$|Peugeot's {{final year}} as Prost's engine {{supplier}} in 2000 saw some optimism, Prost hiring his 1991 Ferrari teammate Jean Alesi {{to drive the}} lead car and German Nick Heidfeld, who had won the 1999 Formula 3000 championship, to partner him. The season proved to <b>be</b> <b>yet</b> another disastrous one, with the AP03 proving to be unreliable and ill handling.

Prost restructured the team, hiring Joan Villadelprat as the managing director and replacing Jenkins with Henri Durand as the team's new technical director.|$|E

25|$|Although this stork shows many common {{courtship}} {{displays in}} storks, these behaviours seem to omit {{some of the}} vocal and visual features {{to be replaced by}} an augmented tactile element.

25|$|Changes in {{endogenous}} {{testosterone levels}} may {{also contribute to}} differences in myotrophic-androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. AR agonists are antigonadotropic – that is, they dose-dependently suppress gonadal testosterone production and hence reduce systemic testosterone concentrations. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body {{with that of the}} exogenous AAS, the myotrophic-androgenic ratio would be expected to be further increased, and this hence may <b>be</b> <b>yet</b> an additional mechanism contributing to the differences in myotrophic-androgenic ratio. In addition, some AAS, such as nandrolone, are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined progestogenic activity might further increase the myotrophic-androgenic ratio for a given AAS.|$|E

His record season and {{his entire career}} would be highlighted by his six-touchdown performance against the San Francisco 49ers at Wrigley Field on December 12. The new element of Sayers helped the Bears to finish in 3rd place with a 9–4–1 record. Sayers continued his offensive successes in 1966 with a then-NFL record 2,440 all-purpose yards, but his offensive success {{did not result in}} wins and the team finished with a 5–7–2 season.

25|$|In the 2008–09 season, Copenhagen began strong. The team {{qualified}} for the 2008–09 UEFA Cup group stage by eliminating Northern Ireland club Cliftonville, Lillestrøm and FC Moscow. In the group, FCK lost at home to Saint-Étienne and drew 1–1 against Valencia. With a 1–1 draw against Rosenborg and a win over Club Brugge, Copenhagen {{qualified for}} the knockout phase of the competition, where it drew 2–2 in {{the first leg of}} the round of 32 against Manchester City on 19 February 2009. The club lost 1–2 in the second leg, a loss that ended its European season. In the domestic league, FCK battled for first place with Brøndby and Odense. Eventually, Copenhagen won the Cup final against AaB and claimed the league title with one game to spare in the tournament, thus securing the Double {{for the second time in}} the club's history. 2010 proved to <b>be</b> <b>yet</b> another European success. Even though the team lost the 2009–10 Champions League playoff match to APOEL with a 2–3 aggregate loss, the team had already qualified to the 2009–10 Europa League group stage by eliminating FK Mogren and Stabæk. Copenhagen lost away to CFR Cluj, won 1–0 at home against Sparta Prague, 0–1 away loss against PSV and by beating Cluj at home 2–0 and 3–0 away over Sparta, Copenhagen {{qualified for the}} round of 32 to face Marseille. The match-up, however, resulted in two 1–3 losses for Copenhagen, thus eliminating them from the competition.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to create}} a blockbuster, Peckinpah decided to take on Convoy (1978). His {{associates}} were perplexed, as they felt his choice to direct such substandard material {{was a result of}} his renewed cocaine use and continued alcoholism. Based on the hit song by C. W. McCall, the film was an attempt to capitalize on the huge success of Smokey and the Bandit (1977). Addictions or not, Peckinpah still felt compelled to turn the genre exercise into something more significant. Unhappy with the screenplay written by B.W.L. Norton, Peckinpah tried to encourage the actors to re-write, improvise and ad-lib their dialogue. In another departure from the script, Peckinpah attempted to add a new dimension by casting a pair of black actors as members of the convoy, Madge Sinclair as Widow Woman and Franklyn Ajaye as Spider Mike. Filmed in New Mexico and starring Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw and Ernest Borgnine, Convoy turned out to <b>be</b> <b>yet</b> another troubled Peckinpah production, with the director's health a continuing problem. Friend and actor James Coburn was brought in to serve as second unit director, and he filmed many of the scenes while Peckinpah remained in his on-location trailer. The film wrapped in September 1977, 11 days behind schedule and $5 million over budget. Surprisingly, Convoy was the highest-grossing picture of Peckinpah's career, notching $46.5 million at the box office, but was panned by many critics, leaving his reputation seriously damaged. For the first time in almost a decade, Peckinpah finished a picture and found himself unemployed.|$|E

500|$|Upset at {{losing the}} 1977 game under poor weather conditions, the Eskimos {{hoped for a}} rematch with Montreal in 1978. Both teams reached the final game, which Edmonton won 20–13.

The Eskimos' dynasty dominated the league, losing a total of only six games during the three seasons from 1979 to 1981. The 1981 Grey Cup was expected to <b>be</b> <b>yet</b> another easy win for Edmonton, who posted a 14–1–1 record during the season and were considered overwhelming favourites against the 5–11 Ottawa Rough Riders.

Once Monk is cleared in Nunn's death, the police find correspondence from Nunn dating back to the era of Trudy's death.
