50|$|Following the procedure, {{the patient}} is {{actively}} monitored in an intensive care unit (ICU).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{recurrence}} in HCV+ {{liver transplant}} recipients is almost inevitable {{and may be}} promoted by immunosuppression. We compared the amount of liver damage with regard to usage of steroids and <b>basiliximab.</b> METHODS: A total of 140 HCV+ adult liver transplant recipients were randomly allocated to <b>basiliximab</b> + steroids or <b>basiliximab</b> + placebo (plus cyclosporine and azathioprine). Primary endpoint: hepatitis C histological recurrence (liver damage as for Ishak grading score >or= 8 by biopsy at 12 months); secondary endpoints: treatment failure (death, graft loss, patient withdrawal), biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR), treated acute rejection (tAR), allograft and patient survival rates at 12 months. RESULTS: Any significant difference has been observed in the 12 -month hepatitis C histological recurrence rate (41. 2 % <b>basiliximab</b> + steroids, 37. 5 % <b>basiliximab</b> + placebo, P = 0. 354). The treatment failure rate was significantly higher in <b>basiliximab</b> + steroids (28. 8 %) than in <b>basiliximab</b> + placebo (15. 6 %), P = 0. 03; the combination test {{for the evaluation of}} the joint hypothesis resulted in a borderline nonsignificant overall result (P = 0. 059). BPAR rate was significantly lower in the group treated with steroids (24. 3 % <b>basiliximab</b> + steroids, 39. 4 % <b>basiliximab</b> + placebo, P = 0. 04), while the tAR rate was similar (29. 7 % <b>basiliximab</b> + steroids and 37. 9 % <b>basiliximab</b> + placebo).

Here we first retrospectively explored the prophylactic effects of <b>basiliximab</b> or daclizumab against GVHD in 82 patients with hematologic malignancies following unrelated donor-peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (URD-PBSCT). All recipients achieved engraftment. The rates of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) were 35. 4 % and 15. 9 %, respectively. Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) developed in 38. 7 % of evaluable patients.

40|$|Carlo B Ramirez, Adam Bozdin, Adam Frank, Warren Maley, Cataldo DoriaDepartment of Surgery, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USAAbstract: Antibody {{induction}} therapy {{has not been}} part of standard immunosuppressive regimens in liver transplantation. However, in recent {{years there has been}} an upward trend in the use of antibody {{induction therapy}} in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), attributed mainly to the growing number of OLT recipients with renal dysfunction after the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring system was adopted in 2002. <b>Basiliximab,</b> a chimeric monoclonal antibody, is the most frequently used induction antibody in OLT. <b>Basiliximab</b> targets the alpha chain of interleukin- 2 receptors in activated T-lymphocytes, inhibiting T-lymphocyte proliferation responsible for acute cellular rejection. <b>Basiliximab</b> (given in two 20 mg doses intravenously on post OLT day 0 and 4) has an excellent efficacy and safety profile. <b>Basiliximab</b> induction also allows early steroid withdrawal or avoidance, as well as delayed introduction and minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in the setting of renal insufficiency.

40|$|Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and its {{receptor}} (IL- 2 R) play {{a central}} role in T lymphocyte activation and immune response after transplantation. Research on the biology of IL- 2 R allowed the identification of key signal transduction pathways involved in the generation of proliferative and antiapoptotic signals in T cells. The alpha-chain of the IL- 2 R is a specific peptide against which monoclonal antibodies have been raised, with the aim of blunting the immune response by means of inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in primed lymphocytes. Indeed, <b>basiliximab,</b> one of such antibodies, has proved to be effective in reducing the episodes of acute rejection after kidney and pancreas transplantation. The use of <b>basiliximab</b> was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of any treated rejection episodes after kidney transplantation in the two major randomised studies (placebo 52. 2 % vs <b>basiliximab</b> 34. 2 % at 6 months, European study; placebo 54. 9 % vs <b>basiliximab</b> 37. 6 % at 1 year, US trial). <b>Basiliximab</b> and equine antithymocyte globulin (ATG) administration resulted in a similar rate of biopsy-proven acute rejection at 6 months (19 % for both) and at 12 months (19 % and 20 %, respectively). The use of <b>basiliximab</b> appears not to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse events as compared with placebo in immunosuppressive regimens, including calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine and corticosteroids, and its safety profile is superior to ATG. Moreover, a similar occurrence of infections is noted in selected studies (65. 5 % after <b>basiliximab</b> vs 65. 7 % of controls), including cytomegalovirus infection (17. 3 % vs 14. 5 %), and cytokine-release syndrome is not observed. Finally, economic analysis demonstrated lower costs of overall treatment in patients treated with <b>basiliximab.</b> Therefore, the use of <b>basiliximab</b> entails a very low risk, allows safe reduction of corticosteroid dosage and reduces the short- and mid-term rejection rates. However, the improvement in the long-term survival of kidney grafts in patients treated according to modern immunosuppressive protocols is still to be demonstrated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Basiliximab,</b> a {{monoclonal}} CD 25 antibody has proofed {{effective in}} reducing acute rejection episodes in adults in various immunosuppressive regimens. The effect of <b>basiliximab</b> in the pediatric population is controversial. METHODS: In a 12 -month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, renal transplant patients aged 1 to 18 years were randomized to <b>basiliximab</b> or placebo with cyclosporine microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. The intent-to-treat population comprised 192 patients (100 <b>basiliximab</b> and 92 placebo). RESULTS: The primary efficacy endpoint, time to first biopsy-proven acute rejection episode, or treatment failure by month 6, occurred in 16. 7 % of basiliximab-treated patients and 21. 7 % of placebo-treated patients (Kaplan-Meier estimates; hazard ratio 0. 72, two-sided 90 % confidence interval 0. 416 - 1. 26, n. s.). The rate and severity of subclinical rejections in protocol biopsies performed at 6 months posttransplant was higher in the <b>basiliximab</b> group (25. 0 %) than {{in the placebo group}} (11. 7 %).

40|$|CD 4 +CD 25 + {{forkhead}} box P 3 (FoxP 3) +regulatory T (Treg) {{cells are}} generated {{and play a}} key role in the induction and maintenance of transplant tolerance in organ recipients. It has been proposed that interleukin (IL) - 2 /IL- 2 receptor (IL- 2 R) signalling was essential for the development and proliferation of antigen-activated T cells that included both effector T cells and Treg cells. <b>Basiliximab</b> (Simulect™), a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against the α-chain of the IL- 2 R (CD 25), can be expected to not only affect alloreactive effector T cells, but also reduce the number and function of Treg cells. We therefore examined the effect of <b>basiliximab</b> induction therapy on the number and function of the Treg cells in renal recipients. <b>Basiliximab</b> decreased the percentage of CD 4 +CD 25 +T cells, but failed to influence the percentage of CD 4 +FoxP 3 + Treg cells. The cellular CD 25 expression was decreased significantly by <b>basiliximab</b> injection, but CD 4 +CD 25 + T cells was not depleted from the circulating pool through monoclonal antibody activation-associated apoptosis. Functional analysis revealed that inhibitory function of Treg cells from recipients with <b>basiliximab</b> injection was not significantly different from recipients without injection. These data indicate that the functional Treg population may not be influenced by short-term <b>basiliximab</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{recurrence}} in HCV+ {{liver transplant}} recipients is almost inevitable {{and may be}} promoted by immunosuppression. <b>Basiliximab,</b> a high-affinity chimeric monoclonal antibody functions as an immunosuppressive agent, is effective in reducing acute rejection episodes in liver allograft recipients, but the influence on HCV recurrence might be a problem. Objectives: To study the effect of induction therapy with <b>Basiliximab</b> on HCV recurrence in adult living donor liver transplantation. Methods: This was a retrospective study {{to determine the effect}} of induction therapy with <b>Basiliximab</b> on the recurrence of HCV in the grafted liver. In this study 47 HCV patients were included who passed more than 6 month post-transplantation. All HCV recurrences were all proved histologically. All our patients received corticosteroids in addition to either tacrolimus (FK) or ciclosporine (Neoral), mycophenolate mofetil was given to all except 4 patients. Results: From the 47 transplanted patients 14 (29. 8 %) had HCV recurrence. In the group which used <b>Basiliximab</b> (Group I); the rate of HCV recurrence was 56. 3 %, while the group in which no Basilximab was used (Group II); the rate of HCV recurrence was 16. 1 % (P< 0. 001) highly significant. In patients who had HCV recurrence 64. 3 % of patients received induction therapy with <b>Basiliximab,</b> meanwhile in the non-recurrent group only 15. 2 % of patients received <b>Basiliximab</b> (P< 0. 001) highly significant. To out rule the role of either FK or Neoral in recurrence of HCV, we found that the rate of HCV recurrence was as follows: in a group of patients who received <b>Basiliximab</b> and FK...|$|E
40|$|The interleukin- 2 {{receptor}} antagonist <b>basiliximab</b> {{has proven}} in large clinical trials {{to be safe}} and effective to reduce acute rejections in the first year after renal transplantation. Since acute rejections are a risk factor for chronic graft loss, their effective reduction might {{have a positive effect on}} long term allograft survival. So far data is spares to prove this hypothesis and 10 -year follow up on <b>basiliximab</b> induction therapy is not available. In our center, 41 patients were enrolled in the multicenter trial CHIB 201 in 1995 / 96 comparing <b>basiliximab</b> vs no induction therapy after renal transplantation. We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of these patients after 10 years. The main reason for patient death with functioning graft were infectious complications (basiliximab: 3 / 20, placebo 1 / 19), 21 % of all patients developed cancer without an obvious correlation to specific immunosuppression.

40|$|Background: Preliminary {{data have}} {{suggested}} that interleukin- 2 receptor blockade with <b>basiliximab</b> may increase steroid sensitivity. We have previously reported a small case series demonstrating the potential of <b>basiliximab</b> as a novel agent {{for the treatment of}} steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis. Aim: To report further experience of the efficacy and safety of treatment with the interleukin- 2 receptor blocking monoclonal antibody <b>basiliximab,</b> in addition to steroids, for the treatment of severe and moderate steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis. Methods: Twenty patients were enrolled – 13 patients with moderate steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis (Ulcerative Colitis Symptom Score: ≥ 6) and seven patients with severe steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis. All were given a single dose of 40 mg <b>basiliximab</b> plus standard steroid therapy in an open-label, uncontrolled trial.
