40|$|LNG is {{becoming}} a common fuel for shipping. With an increasing demand for <b>bunkering</b> possibilities, <b>bunkering</b> <b>vessels</b> for LNG are being built. This report {{is based on the}} theory that a ship-to-ship bunkering operation and a conventional loading/discharging operation at a terminal are different and require different skills from the staff on board. The main questions this report tries to answer is whether the safety risks of the different operations differ and what specific educational demands are placed on those working on board <b>bunkering</b> <b>vessels</b> for LNG and gas tankers for LNG. Today, there is a regulatory framework that both vessel types shall obey, the IGC Code. In addition to the IGC Code, {{there are a variety of}} local rules and guidelines relating to the various operations. We want to see if there is need for a type-specific training for staff who work on board <b>bunkering</b> <b>vessels.</b> A triangulating approach has been the method used during the process. The background section has largely been based on a literature review of previous works and scientific articles relating to the subject. In the discussion and result chapters we have then been able to both verify and question our findings in the background chapter, using information taken from interviews and observations. The result shows that the operations bunkering ship-to-ship vs. loading/unloading at a terminal does not differ in any significant way. The operations are not significantly affected by the size of the ship. However, the result shows that there are in fact different safety hazards onboard the different ships that co-relates with their differences in design, systems, purpose, and the vessels operational pattern. Training requirements do not differ between the two ship types. The report shows that both systems on board the vessels, as well as risks during operations differ. Thus pointing out that further training and education for staff working onboard <b>bunkering</b> <b>vessels</b> is advised...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{detailed}} {{study on the}} possibility {{and the need for}} an implementation of a LNG <b>bunker</b> <b>vessel</b> connected to the prospective future LNG terminal in the Port of Gothenburg as part of efforts to increase the terminal's attractiveness and accessibility to its customers. The reports aim is to highlight what type of ownership structure that would be best suited for a future implementation of a LNG <b>bunker</b> <b>vessel</b> in the terminal operators point of view. The analysis were conducted {{in the form of a}} literature review combined with interviews with people linked to the current terminal construction, the Port of Gothenburg, and analysts of the LNG market. The interviews were conducted with representatives from these segments to give the reader a clearer and more comprehensive overview of the future need of a LNG <b>bunker</b> <b>vessel</b> and the development of the LNG market. Estimated costs have also been produced to more clearly demonstrate and justify the choice of ownership structure and to give a rough idea of what a project of this magnitude could cost the involved parties. There may be a need for an LNG bunkering vessels to the planned LNG terminal in the Port of Gothenburg if the development of vessels using LNG as its main power source increases at the same rate as in the current situation. The investment and operations of the prospective <b>bunker</b> <b>vessel</b> is associated with massive costs but an implementation could make the Port of Gothenburg a very attractive and strategically important hub for effective bunkering operations for ships that use LNG as main fuel source. To be able to secure an implementation as cost efficient and well organized as possible, a carefully selected ship-owner with deep knowledge of the subject and the implementation processes needs to cooperate with the terminal operator in such way that the ship-owner develops the vessel along with the terminal operators preferences and then time charter the LNG <b>bunker</b> <b>vessel</b> to the terminal operator...|$|E

30|$|Certain {{types of}} {{infrastructure}} and equipment {{are required to}} produce, store and transport bunkers, and to bunker LNG-fuelled ships. Interviews with bunkering companies and with shipping companies in previous stages of this research indicate that a chicken-and-egg dilemma constitutes a barrier {{to the development of}} supply and demand in the LNG bunkering market. On the one hand, shipping companies will postpone investing in LNG-powered vessels {{as long as there is}} uncertainty regarding the availability of LNG at the vessels’ ports of call, and the market price of LNG must moreover justify any additional investment required for LNG conversion or newbuilding. On the other, bunkering companies will remain reticent to invest in new (or retrofitted) <b>bunkering</b> <b>vessels</b> as long as there are no guarantees that future demand for LNG justifies such financial commitment. The same logic applies to investments in LNG bunkering infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|While Falmouth's {{maritime}} {{activity has}} much declined from its heyday, the docks {{are still a}} major contributor to the town's economy. It is the largest port in Cornwall.

40|$|With rising oil prices, {{there is}} growing {{interest}} in more accurate measurement during transfers of marine fuel oil, whether {{for the purposes of}} environmental monitoring or for validating custody transfer. Air entrainment is a common problem in marine fuel transfer (bunkering) operations, which can induce measurement errors in many metering technologies. The latest generation of Coriolis mass flow meters is able to operate in both single- and two-phase (oil-air) flow conditions. Witnessed trials have taken place at the National Engineering Laboratory in the UK using a large (200 mm diameter) Coriolis flowmeter. The accuracies of the mass flow and density measurements were assessed for steady single-phase and two-phase flow on high and low viscosity oils. Meter accuracy was further assessed over a series of simulated bunkering operations, in which the meter started and finished empty of oil, with periods of both single and two-phase operation. Further trials of a metering skid are currently being carried on a <b>bunkering</b> <b>vessel</b> in Singapore...|$|R

5000|$|Hong Lam Marine {{was founded}} in 1981 by Lim Teck Cheng, the current Chief Executive, {{together}} with his father. Business began with two wooden barges chartered to Esso Singapore, which transported fuel within the Singapore port. In the same year, Esso Singapore awarded two more contracts to Hong Lam Marine. Hong Lam Marine expanded their fleet with the purchase of two steel bunker tankers from Japan. These were then modified to meet the local regulations for operating in the Port of Singapore. In 1989, the company started building single-hull ships of 4,000 - 6,000 DWT. [...] In 2005, Hong Lam Marine ventured into the building of double-hull vessels. In 2007, the company went on to form a joint-venture company with the Japanese trading house, Toyota Tsusho, to build and own two 22,000 DWT tankers, SPECTRUM and SPLENDOUR. These two world’s largest purpose-built bunker tankers were delivered in 2009. Hong Lam Marine works closely with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) to implement green shipping practices. The company commissioned a series of 10 diesel-electric <b>bunkering</b> <b>vessels,</b> which were delivered between 2011 and 2013. They are also the first company in Singapore to use MPA approved mass flow meters on its <b>vessels</b> for <b>bunker</b> delivery. According to Mr Lim, these mass flow meters “can supply 15 to 20% more fuel” for their vessels and also save up to 3 hours per bunker delivery. The company is also involved in a Joint Industry Project (JIP) to investigate the operational feasibility of liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering in Singapore in collaboration with 22 industry partners. Currently, the use of LNG in Singapore is hindered by the high operating costs required to purchase and transport it, {{as well as a}} lack of demand for it.|$|R

40|$|Method of {{mathematical}} simulation of heat transfer processes in polymer composite (PC) products with intricate configuration, being an alternative of using up-to-date commercial software complexes has been developed. On {{the example of}} PC container with instrumentation and fiberglass electric heaters located in it, a mathematical model describing unsteady temperature field (a system of nonlinear differential heat balance equations for each element) has been formulated. Features of heat transfer between elements (heaters, instrumentation, enclosing structures) were taken into account. The verification of the method was conducted by comparing of theoretical temperature distributions with results of measurements in experiments with simplified variant of the structure. The developed method is effective, in particular, for such PC products as containers, modules, <b>bunkers</b> and <b>vessels.</b> It allows us to specify optimum operation modes for heating elements, operational parameters for conditioners and funs, heat insulation characteristics for providing a given level of air temperature inside objects in winter and summer service periods...|$|R

5000|$|In {{his last}} book, {{published}} posthumously, Gower {{reflected on the}} gigantic advances made {{in the use of}} iron and steam. He noted this especially on the railroads where passengers and heavy freight travelled at the extraordinary velocity of thirty miles per hour.

He hoped that vessels of the Transit type would ply across the Ocean until [...] "more portable means shall be invented for putting steamers in motion". Just five years later SS Sirius and Brunel's SS Great Western crossed the Atlantic under steam power alone.

60|$|With {{the death}} of Senor Perkins ended the Crusade of the Excelsior. Under charge of Captain <b>Bunker</b> the <b>vessel</b> was sent to Mazatlan by the authorities, bearing the banished and proscribed Americans, Banks, Brace, Winslow, and Crosby; and, by {{permission}} of the Council, also their friends, Markham and Brimmer, and the ladies, Mrs. Brimmer, Chubb, and Markham. Hurlstone and Miss Keene alone were invited to remain, but, on later representations, the Council graciously included Richard Keene in the invitation, with the concession of the right to work the mines and control the ranches he and Hurlstone had purchased from their proscribed countrymen. The complacency of the Council of Todos Santos may be accounted for when it is understood that on the day the firm of Hurlstone & Keene was really begun under the title of Mr. and Mrs. Hurlstone, Richard had prevailed upon the Alcalde to allow him to add the piquant Dona Isabel also to the firm under the title of Mrs. Keene. Although the port of Todos Santos was henceforth open to all commerce, the firm of Hurlstone & Keene long retained the monopoly of trade, and was a recognized power of intelligent civilization and honest progress on the Pacific coast. And none contributed more to that result than the clever and beautiful hostess of Excelsior Lodge, the charming country home of James Hurlstone, Esq., senior partner of the firm. Under the truly catholic shelter of its veranda Padre Esteban and the heretic stranger mingled harmoniously, and the dissensions of local and central Government were forgotten.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes new {{equations}} {{to calculate}} shipping costs and slot distribution when {{working in a}} shipping alliance environment. The fixed costs and capacity are shared by a predetermined ration of contributed containerships for the jointly-operated service route. The exchange rate of slot-exchange pattern depends on the relative ration of both round-voyage sailing days. Each contributing shipping company needs to estimate and account for the voyage fixed costs of each component serviced route in the agreement. This paper also simulates the effects that <b>bunker</b> cost and <b>vessel</b> hire changes have on shipping costs. The examination indicated the fixed costs are US$ 424 per TEU in 2010, with 63. 1 % attributable to bunker costs and 24. 04 % to containership costs. The validation shows the peak of charter hire in 2006, the fixed costs were estimated US$ 637 per TEU, with 63. 92 % attributable to containership costs and 27. 53 % attributable to bunker costs. (for ship of a capacity of 1, 100 TEUs and 28 round trip days). The results proof the proposed equations can represent cost and are helpful for container carriers to maintain market competition...|$|R

40|$|The Panama Canal {{has become}} a {{constraining}} factor on trade across the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, {{and the expansion of}} the Canal is expected to have a positive influence on world trade. Our research investigates the competitiveness of the Panama Canal in the container shipping industry and the possible macroeconomic consequences of the canal expansion. We have designed a model that compares costs and earnings for single voyages and round-trips, and with a basis in opportunity cost theory we compare the Panama Canal with alternative routes and analyze the sensitivity of key variables for different scenarios. From our analyses we see that the current <b>bunker</b> price forces <b>vessels</b> to slow-steam to maintain profits. This has led shipowners to prioritize cost savings at the expense of fewer annual voyages. Simultaneously, operators in the container industry are constantly seeking to exploit large-scale advantages and we find strong evidence that the unit cost and the size of vessels are inversely proportional. This has led to a relentless upsizing of container vessels, and our calculations suggest that the expanded Panama Canal will face competition from the Ultra-Large Container Vessel segment. Further, our findings suggest that the current Panama Canal toll system with a constant price per TEU transited will not be applicable when opening for Post- Panamax vessels. Therefore, the Panama Canal toll system should be adjusted to facilitate for economies of scale in order for the Canal to stay competitive with alternative routes. As the world shipping market is still adjusting after the financial crisis in 2008, the expansion comes at an interesting point in time and the possible consequences are multidimensional. Our research suggests that the effects can be both positive and negative for shipowners depending on whether the expansion leads to an increase in tradable volume or a shift in existing trade. nhhma...|$|R
