40|$|Abstract — Dual site {{spectrum}} measurements {{have been}} made in the public <b>safety</b> <b>band</b> in Howard County, Maryland, USA. The public <b>safety</b> <b>band</b> is of interest because of its obvious importance and the increasing need to determine whether improved spectral utilization would accommodate increased usage for public safety. Two receiver suites were synchronized and used to measure concurrent spectra at separation between a few meters up to a few kilometers. These measurements prove useful in examining issues of spectrum sensing for dynamic spectrum access, including receiver sensitivity, primary user signal detection, adjacent channel interference, and policy performance with local and cooperative sensing. We analyze the collected data to characterize the usage of this public safety network and provide insights into how white space can be identified and utilized. We propose a class of opportunistic access strategies and demonstrate how collected data can be used to evaluate the performance of such schemes.

40|$|Abstract There is {{widespread}} {{concern over the}} risks, real or feared, from the rapidly increasing inventory of chemicals in commercial use. Many users of chemicals rely for their information on their supplier and safety data sheets (SDS). These summaries of properties are difficult for the average user to convert into practical control action. It is possible to take the classification data (the Risk Phrases) which are globally harmonised and link these directly to control advice given {{a knowledge of the}} process and purpose of the chemical- information immediately available to many. A level of control can be introduced, which although lacking the specific assurance of a professional hygiene and toxicological assessment does present sensible action. This approach has received widespread support by employers, workers and professional hygienists in the UK, and is now being taken forward in other countries, through the European Commission, and globally through ILO.

40|$|The Real-Time Failure Control (RTFC) program {{involves}} {{development of}} a failure detection algorithm, for the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). This failure detection approach is signal-based and entails monitoring SSME measurement signals based on predetermined as well as on-line computed {{mean and standard deviation}} values. Twenty-four engine measurements are monitored in the algorithm and provisions are made to add more parameters if needed. Each of the first values of every measurement signal at the algorithm start is checked against safety limits placed around a pre-computed engine-to-engine mean value (MV) with a bandwidth equal to a given multiple of the pre-computed standard deviation (SD). If several parameters are out of the bounds of these limits a failure is signaled. During the first two seconds (after algorithm start) a moving average (MA) and a SD is computed on-line in real-time. The moving average of each parameter is computed by averaging the incoming signal measurement with the four most recent previous signal measurements. The moving average is updated at every sampling interval (40 msec) and is checked against a similar <b>safety</b> <b>band</b> around the initial signal value for each parameter. If several anomalies are registered, a failure is signaled by the algorithm. At the end of the two-second interval the MA is fixed as the mean value {{for the rest of the}} algorithm operation and a <b>safety</b> <b>band</b> is placed above and below this value equal to a multiple of the computed SD. However, the <b>safety</b> <b>band</b> is adjusted by adjusting the mean value when propellant tank repressurization and venting take place. 'Influence Coefficients' are used to make the necessary adjustments to the safety limits of those parameters that are affected by repressurization and venting or valve closure and opening. The MA is, in both cases, continuously updated and checked against the <b>safety</b> <b>band.</b> Once more, if several parameters exceed the limits a failure is signaled. At the start of every scheduled power transient the algorithm is stopped. It is re-initiated after two seconds from the termination of the power transient and the process is repeated. The final report is divided into four major sections. The most encompassing of all is the discussion section that has sub-sections on: (1) RTFC algorithm development, (2) RTFC simulations; (3) RTFC current limitations; and (4) enhancements planned for...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the amount of}} radio spectrum required for reliable vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communication for traffic safety. The basic feature of the traffic safety application is that it uses periodical broadcasts of status messages containing the location and velocity of transmitting vehicles. In our study we consider two dominant technologies for V 2 V communication, namely IEEE 802. 11 p and self-organizing time division multiple access (STDMA). We analyze the spectrum demand for a dense highway scenario with a stringent reliability requirement. The results indicate that more than 80 MHz bandwidth is needed to achieve 99 % reliability in certain cases. This is {{in stark contrast to}} current regulatory decisions that dedicate only 10 MHz bandwidth in 5. 9 GHz <b>band</b> for <b>safety</b> purposes in intelligent transportation system (ITS) in Europe and US.

Radios linked the caboose with the locomotive cab. Early police radio systems were initially one way using MF frequencies above the AM broadcast band, (1.7 MHz). Some early systems talked back to dispatch on a 30-50 MHz link, (called crossband).|$|R
