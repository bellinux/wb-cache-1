5|$|Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian {{psychologist}} Jozef Nuttin, the name-letter {{effect has}} been replicated {{in dozens of}} studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for initials, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both given and family names still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, {{the birds}} are not {{classified}} as being able to recognize their reflection, because those that did were trained {{to do so and}} the animal must {{be able to do this}} without human assistance: it must also be shown that {{the birds are}} able to do this in the wild with no experience, just on their own intelligence. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> an animal is trained to do this, it is still unknown if they are self-aware, or are just repeating the same movements and commands that they were taught so that they may receive a treat as a reward after they have correctly completed their task.|$|E
25|$|The film {{industry}} in Argentina reached a pinnacle {{in the late}} 1930s and 1940s when an average of forty-two films were produced annually. The films usually included tango, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> a tango theme was omitted most cinema from this period still included humble heroes and wealthy villains. In these films, it portrayed hard work and poverty as ennobling and depicted the poor as the primary beneficiaries of Juan Perón's economic policies. These films, in part supported by Perón, were {{seen as part of}} the political agenda of peronism. By supporting a {{film industry}} that attacked greed and supported the working class, Perón was able to influence the attitudes of his constituency to build public appeal.|$|E

25|$|The tench (Tinca tinca), a {{significant}} food species farmed in western Eurasia in large numbers, is unusual. It {{is most often}} grouped with the Leuciscinae, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> these were rather loosely circumscribed, it always stood apart. A cladistic analysis of DNA sequence data of the S7 ribosomal protein intron1 supports the view that it is distinct enough to constitute a monotypic subfamily. It also suggests it may {{be closer to the}} small East Asian Aphyocypris, Hemigrammocypris, and Yaoshanicus. They would have diverged roughly at the same time from cyprinids of east-central Asia, perhaps {{as a result of the}} Alpide orogeny that vastly changed the topography of that region in the late Paleogene, when their divergence presumably occurred.|$|E
25|$|Indians {{resisted}} cultivating sugarcane themselves, {{preferring to}} tend their subsistence crops. As in the Caribbean, black slave labor became {{crucial to the}} development of sugar estates. During the period 1580-1640 when Spain and Portugal were ruled by the same monarch and Portuguese slave traders had access to Spanish markets, African slaves were imported in large numbers to New Spain and many of them remained in the region of Veracruz. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> that connection was broken and prices rose, black slaves remained an important component of Córdoba's labor sector even after 1700. Rural estates in Córdoba depended on African slave labor, who were 20% of the population there, a far greater proportion than any other area of New Spain, and greater than even nearby Jalapa.|$|E
500|$|Blackburn manager Sam Allardyce said in April 2010 that Robinson {{should be}} the number one goalkeeper for England again due to his {{impressive}} club form; however, Robinson {{failed to make the}} England squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, with Joe Hart, David James and Robert Green being selected instead, a decision which prompted criticism from both Allardyce, who stated, [...] " [...] has made the biggest mistake of his selection process," [...] and Gordon Banks, who stated, [...] "Blackburn picked up halfway through the season <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> Robinson was letting goals in, they weren't necessarily his fault.

500|$|Martin Stevens {{and colleagues}} in 2006 made what they {{believed}} was the first experimental test that [...] "disruptive coloration is effective even when some colour patches do not match the background and have a high contrast with both the background and adjacent pattern elements (disruptive contrast)". They used [...] "moth-like targets", some matching the lightness of the background oak tree bark, other mismatching it, each with a dead mealworm. If the mealworm was removed it was assumed a bird predator had taken it: this could be distinguished from visits by other predators. They found that disruptive coloration provided the best protection from bird predators when the pattern was matched to background luminance, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> elements in a pattern did not match, disruptive patterns were still better at reducing predation than either non-disruptive patterns or plain (unpatterned) control targets.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the best}} efforts of the slaveholders, Tubman was never captured, and neither were the fugitives she guided. Years later, she told an audience: [...] "I was {{conductor}} of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say – I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger." [...] One of her last missions into Maryland was to retrieve her aging parents. Her father, Ben, had purchased Rit, her mother, in 1855 from Eliza Brodess for 20 dollars. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> they were both free, the area became hostile to their presence. Two years later, Tubman received word that her father had harbored a group of eight escaped slaves, and was at risk of arrest. She traveled to the Eastern Shore and led them north to St. Catharines, Ontario, where a community of former slaves (including Tubman's brothers, other relatives, and many friends) had gathered.|$|E
500|$|Governors {{in office}} were more {{constrained}} than {{elsewhere in the}} Spanish Empire. [...] Unpopular governors faced the threat of being removed {{through the application of}} the Decree of 1537; <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> such drastic measures were not used, the governor's power was curtailed. [...] The cabildo (town council) of Asunción was powerful, and governors often found it difficult for their edicts to be enforced or obeyed if they acted without consulting the cabildo and securing its consent. [...] Spain contributed relatively {{little in the way of}} troops, officials, funds, or armaments to Paraguay, and after it was determined that the region was not in fact rich in precious metals or other resources, immigration slowed. [...] However, the interior of South America was dangerous, with Portuguese-aligned slavers and hostile Indian tribes to threaten the Paraguayans. [...] Paraguay fended for itself with an armed militia. [...] This also limited the governor's influence, as it was the members of the cabildo who rallied the militia.|$|E

500|$|The {{inner and}} outer bailey walls have also been damaged by sea erosion, but they {{originally}} formed concentric squares around the keep and were protected by ditches. The outer bailey wall, [...] thick in places, is no longer very substantial, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> first built {{it may have been}} quite weak; it is protected by a moat, up to [...] wide and [...] deep. Both the baileys are protected by towers; the outer bailey towers are each [...] wide. The inner bailey wall is [...] thick, protected by a [...] wide moat. Its towers were a later addition to the original design, and a gatehouse in the inner bailey wall was also built shortly after the construction of the castle.

500|$|In January 2000, {{three months}} after the system's North American launch, Electronic Gaming Monthly offered praise for the game library, stating, [...] "...with triple-A stuff like Soul Calibur, NBA 2K, and soon Crazy Taxi to kick around, we figure you're happy you took the 128-bit plunge." [...] In a retrospective, PC Magazines Jeffrey L. Wilson {{referred}} to Dreamcast's [...] "killer library" [...] and emphasized Sega's creative influence and visual innovation as being at its peak during the lifetime of the system. The staff of Edge agreed with this assessment on Dreamcast's original titles, as well as Sega's arcade conversions, stating that the system [...] "delivered the first games that could meaningfully be described as arcade perfect." [...] GamePro writer Blake Snow referred to the library as being [...] "much celebrated". Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer praised Dreamcast's NAOMI arcade ports, opining [...] "The thrill of playing Crazy Taxi in the arcade knowing full well that a pixel-perfect conversion (and not some cut-down port) was set to arrive on the Dreamcast is an experience gamers are unlikely to witness again." [...] Nick Montfort and Mia Consalvo, writing in Loading... The Journal of the Canadian Game Studies Association, argued that [...] "the Dreamcast hosted a remarkable amount of videogame development that went beyond the odd and unusual and is interesting when considered as avant-garde... {{it is hard to imagine}} a commercial console game expressing strong resistance to the commodity perspective and to the view that game production is commerce. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> it comes to resisting commercialization, it is arguable that Dreamcast games came closer to expressing this attitude than any other console games have." [...] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish favorably compared Sega's Dreamcast output, which included some of [...] "the most varied, creative, and fun [...] the company had ever produced", with its [...] "enervated" [...] status as a third-party. Fahs noted [...] "The Dreamcast's life was fleeting, but it was saturated with memorable titles, most of which were completely new properties." [...] According to author Steven L. Kent, [...] "From Sonic Adventure and Shenmue to Space Channel 5 and Seaman, Dreamcast delivered and delivered and delivered." ...|$|E
