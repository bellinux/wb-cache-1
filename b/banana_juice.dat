Consuming isotonic drink is one of the ways to restore lost body fluids so that the body can avoid dehydration and extend the muscle endurance. In addition, banana is a source of carbohydrates and electrolytes that are effectively used to maintain the muscle endurance. However, no studies have compared the effectiveness of isotonic drink and <b>banana</b> <b>juice</b> towards muscles endurance during 30 minutes of running. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of isotonic drink and <b>banana</b> <b>juice</b> towards muscles endurance during 30 minutes of running. Method: This was a comparative quasi experimental research with pre-test and post-test design. The subjects were students of Faculty of Medicine, University of Diponegoro aged 18 - 24 years old (n = 16).

40|$|The {{effect of}} hen egg white {{lysozyme}} (HEWL) and bacteriophage lambda lysozyme (LaL) {{in combination with}} high pressure (HP) treatment on the inactivation of four gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella typhimurium), was studied in skim milk (pH 6. 8; a(w) 0. 997) and in <b>banana</b> <b>juice</b> (pH 3. 8; a(w) 0. 971). In the absence of lysozymes, S. flexneri was more sensitive to HP in milk than in <b>banana</b> <b>juice,</b> while the opposite was observed for the other three bacteria. In combination with HP treatment, LaL was more effective than HEWL on all bacteria in both milk and <b>banana</b> <b>juice.</b> Depending on the bacteria, inactivation levels in <b>banana</b> <b>juice</b> were increased from 0. 4 - 2. 7 log units by HP treatment alone to 3. 6 - 6. 5 log units {{in the presence of}} 224 U/ml LaL. Bacterial inactivation in milk was also enhanced by LaL but only by 0. 5 - 2. 1 log units. Under the experimental conditions used, LaL was more effective in <b>banana</b> <b>juice</b> than in milk, while the effectiveness of HEWL under the same conditions was not significantly affected by the food matrix. This effect could be ascribed to the low pH of the <b>banana</b> <b>juice</b> since LaL was also more effective on E. coli in buffer at pH 3. 8 than at pH 6. 8. Since neither LaL nor HEWL are enzymatically active at pH 3. 8, we analysed bacterial lysis after HP treatment in the presence of these enzymes, and found that inactivation proceeds through a non-lytic mechanism at pH 3. 8 and a lytic mechanism at pH 6. 8. Based on these results, LaL may offer interesting perspectives for use as an extra hurdle in high pressure food preservation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Viticulture and Oenology. Wine Biotechnology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Although bananas {{are widely}} grown {{worldwide}} in many tropical {{and a few}} subtropical countries, banana beverages are still among the fruit beverages processed by use of rudimentary methods {{such as the use}} of feet or/and spear grass to extract juice. Because <b>banana</b> <b>juice</b> and beer remained on a home made basis, there is a research drive to come up with modern technologies to more effectively process bananas and to make acceptable banana juices and wines. One of the main hindrances in the production of highly desirable beverages is the pectinaceous nature of the banana fruit, which makes juice extraction and clarification very difficult. Commercial enzyme applications seem to be the major way forward in solving processing problems in order to improve <b>banana</b> <b>juice</b> and wine quality. The particular pectinolytic enzymes that were selected for this study are Rapidase CB, Rapidase TF, Rapidase X-press and OE-Lallzyme. In addition this study, investigate the applicability of recombinant yeast strains with pectinolytic, xylanolytic, glucanolytic and amylolytic activities in degrading the banana polysaccharides (pectin, xylan, glucan starch) for juice and wine extraction and product clarification. The overall objective of this research was to improve <b>banana</b> <b>juice</b> and wine by enzymatic processing techniques and to improve alcoholic fermentation and to produce limpid and shelf-stable products of clarified juice and wine. The focus was on applying the selected commercial enzyme preparations specifically for the production of better clarified <b>banana</b> <b>juice</b> and wine. This is because the turbid <b>banana</b> <b>juice</b> and beer, which contain suspended solids that are characterised by a very intense banana flavour, require a holistic approach to address challenges and opportunities in order to process pure banana beverages with desirable organoleptic qualities. The specific objectives of applying commercial enzymes in the processing of <b>banana</b> <b>juice</b> and wine, comparing with grape winemaking practices, use of recombinant yeast and analyses of various parameters in the juices and wines made have enabled generation of information that could be of help to prospective <b>banana</b> <b>juice</b> and wine processors. The research findings obtained could be used to establish a pilot plant or small-scale industry in the banana processing beverages producing large quantities,and finally the overall objective of obtaining limpid and shelf stable products would be achieved...|$|E

One group was covered with paper {{on the top of the}} cup and another group was without covered and were kept inside the refrigerator having a temperature of approximately 50 o C for a 16 days storage period. The removal of moisture percentage was measured every four days of interval during storage. The evaporation rate (gm/d) of dahi samples was also calculated by how much amount of water was removed per day during storage. The removal of moisture percentage and evaporation rate (g/d) of dahi samples of with cover group was lower than that of dahi samples of without cover group and evaporation rate of dahi samples of both with cover and without cover group was increased gradually due to incorporation of <b>banana</b> <b>juice...</b>|$|E
40|$|Generally, frugivorous lepidopteran, {{have great}} {{ecological}} importance {{and are often}} used as bioindicator in environmental assessment studies. However, the proposed methodologies for capturing moths require great effort on the field for installation and monitoring of traps, {{in addition to their}} high cost. Thereat attractive baits have been evaluated to assist the work of detection and monitoring of moths. The aim of this study was, therefore, to record the diversity of the Noctuidae family captured by traps with food attractions evaluate the performance of this methodology model for its use in future work with cutworms. The study was conducted in urban semideciduous seasonal forest fragment in which three types of bait were used: pineapple with sugarcane <b>juice,</b> <b>banana</b> with sugarcane <b>juice,</b> and <b>banana</b> with water and collected 49 individuals of the Noctuidae family spread over six genera and eleven species. The bait of pineapple with sugarcane juice was the one with the highest diversity index, but the bait that showed greater wealth and greater dominance was banana with water as bait <b>banana</b> with sugarcane <b>juice</b> showed the highest equitability. From the results, it can be inferred that the use of attractive traps can be an advantageous alternative for Rapid Ecological Assessment or determining the presence of some groups as Noctuidae in a given area, explaining the need for the improvement of traps and bait tests to obtain best response of moths to this methodology...|$|R
50|$|Goombay Smash is a rum based {{beverage}} in the Bahamas. It {{is traditionally}} {{served in a}} sling or collins glass. The Goombay Smash was created by Emily Cooper, aka Miss Emily, at the Blue Bee Bar in New Plymouth. The original recipe is a secret, but it {{is believed to have}} contained coconut rum, dirty rum, apricot brandy, and pineapple juice. Imitators and variations commonly use rum, coconut and pineapple juice. Apricot liqueur is sometimes used and dark, amber or spiced rums (dirty rums) are preferred. In place of coconut rum, coconut cream can be used. Other variations include Creme de <b>Banana,</b> orange <b>juice</b> and grenadine.|$|R
