500|$|The Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics, {{also called}} the Satter Prize, is one of twenty-one prizes given out by the American Mathematical Society (AMS). It is {{presented}} biennially in recognition of an outstanding contribution to mathematics research by {{a woman in the}} previous six years. The award was established in 1990 using a donation from Joan <b>Birman,</b> in memory of her sister, Ruth Lyttle Satter, who worked primarily in biological sciences, and was a proponent for equal opportunities for women in science. First awarded in 1991, the award is intended to [...] "honor [...] commitment to research and to encourage women in science". [...] The winner is selected by the council of the AMS, based on the recommendation of a selection committee. The prize is awarded at the Joint Mathematics Meetings during odd numbered years, and has always carried a modest cash reward. Since 2003, the prize has been $5,000, while from 1997 to 2001, the prize came with $1,200, and prior to that it was $4,000. If a joint award is made, the prize money is split between the recipients.|$|E

Mitted Ragdolls, which weren't allowed titling in CFA until the 2008-2009 show season, are often {{confused}} with <b>Birmans.</b> The easiest way {{to tell the difference}} is by size (the Ragdoll being obviously larger) and chin color (Mitted Ragdolls have white chins, while <b>Birmans</b> have colored chins), although breeders recognize the two by head shape and boning.|$|R
5000|$|No clear {{record of}} the breed's origin exists. They are most often claimed to have {{originated}} as the companions of temple priests in northern Burma in the Mount of Lugh. [...] Many stories exist of how the cats first came to France, including pairs of cats being given {{as a reward for}} helping defend a temple, or being smuggled out of Burma by a Vanderbilt. [...] Another pair of <b>Birmans</b> (or a pregnant female called Poupée de Maldapour) were said to have been stolen and later imported to France by Thadde Haddisch. The first traces of historical <b>Birmans</b> go back to a Mme Leotardi in the city of Nice in France.|$|R
50|$|<b>Birmans</b> have a medium-sized, {{rectangular}} {{body with}} a broad face and distinct Roman nose. Their ears are ideally as wide on the base as they are tall and should be set as much {{on top of the}} head as on the side. The eyes are rounded and should be a deep sapphire blue.|$|R
2500|$|Other prototypes in the F6F series {{included}} the XF6F-4 (02981, a {{conversion of the}} XF6F-1 powered by an R-2800-27 and armed with four 20mm M2 cannon) which first flew on 3 October 1942 as the prototype for the projected F6F-4. This version never entered production and 02981 was converted to an F6F-3 production aircraft. Another experimental prototype was the XF6F-2 (66244), an F6F-3 converted to use a Wright R-2600-15, fitted with a <b>Birman</b> manufactured mixed-flow turbocharger, which was later replaced by a Pratt & Whitney R-2800-21, also fitted with a <b>Birman</b> turbocharger. The turbochargers proved to be unreliable on both engines, while performance improvements were marginal. As with the XF6F-4, 66244 was soon converted back to a standard F6F-3. [...] Two XF6F-6s (70188 and 70913) were converted from F6F-5s and used the 18-cylinder 2,100hp (1,567kW) Pratt and Whitney R-2800-18W two-stage supercharged radial engine with water injection and driving a Hamilton-Standard four-bladed propeller. The XF6F-6s were the fastest version of the Hellcat series with {{a top speed of}} 417mph (671km/h), but the war ended before this variant could be mass-produced.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} {{published}} in the January 2007 Notices of the American Mathematical Society, commenting on the New Yorker article, Joan <b>Birman</b> asserts that the mathematical profession has taken a [...] "very public and very bad black mark" [...] from {{the circumstances of the}} publication in the Asian Journal of Mathematics of the Cao-Zhu paper. Describing the paper as making [...] "a serious assertion" [...] about gaps in Perelman's proof and their filling by Cao and Zhu, she questions why the AJM editorial board apparently assented to publication of such a paper by authors known to have [...] "deep personal attachments" [...] to the AJM editors-in-chief, and based not on consultation but on notification a few days before publication, without a copy of the paper, its abstract or the reports of independent referees.|$|E
2500|$|Blumenthal {{estimated}} that the snow line had been as low as [...] in elevation during the Late Pleistocene. Such a snow line would have created an ice cap of [...] in extent. However, he observed a lack of any clear evidence of prehistoric moraines other than those which were close to the 1958 glacier tongues. Blumenthal explained {{the absence of such}} moraines by the lack of confining ridges to control glaciers, insufficient debris load in the ice to form moraines, and their burial by later eruptions. Years later, <b>Birman</b> observed on the south-facing slopes a possible moraine that extends at least [...] in altitude below the base of the 1958 ice cap at an elevation of [...] He also found two morainal deposits that were created by a Mount Ararat valley glacier of Pleistocene, possibly Wisconsinan (Last Glacial Maximum) age downvalley from Lake Balık. The higher moraine lies at an altitude of about [...] and the lower moraine lies at an altitude of about [...] The lower moraine occurs about [...] downstream from Lake Balık. Both moraines are about [...] high. It is suspected that Lake Balık occupies a glacial basin.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} possible differences in felinine excretion between domesticated cat breeds. For this purpose, urine was collected from a total of 83 privately owned entire male cats from eight different breeds in the Netherlands during the period of November 2010 till November 2011. In the collected samples, free felinine and creatinine concentrations were measured. Free felinine concentrations were expressed relative to the urinary creatinine concentration to compensate for possible variations in renal output. The mean (±SD) felinine:creatinine (Fel:Cr) ratio as measured over all cats was 0. 702 (± 0. 265). Both the Abyssinian and Sphynx breeds showed the highest Fel:Cr ratio (0. 878 ± 0. 162 and 0. 878 ± 0. 341 respectively) which significantly differed from the ratios of the British Shorthairs (0. 584 ± 0. 220), <b>Birmans</b> (0. 614 ± 0. 266), Norwegian Forest cats (0. 566 ± 0. 296) and Siberian cats (0. 627 ± 0. 124). The Fel:Cr ratios of the Persians (0. 792 ± 0. 284) and Ragdolls (0. 673 ± 0. 256) showed no statistical difference with either of the other breeds. A significant proportion of the observed variation between the different feline breeds could be explained by hair growth, as both hair growth and felinine production compete for available cysteine. Shorthaired and hairless cat breeds generally showed a higher Fel:Cr ratio compared to longhaired cat breeds, with the exception of Persian cats. Further research is warranted to more closely study the effect of hair growth on felinine production...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} characterise feline audiogenic reflex {{seizures}} (FARS). Methods: An online questionnaire {{was developed to}} capture information from owners with cats suffering from FARS. This was collated with the medical records from the primary veterinarian. Ninety-six cats were included. Results: Myoclonic seizures {{were one of the}} cardinal signs of this syndrome (90 / 96), frequently occurring prior to generalised tonic–clonic seizures (GTCSs) in this population. Other features include a late onset (median 15 years) and absence seizures (6 / 96), with most seizures triggered by high-frequency sounds amid occasional spontaneous seizures (up to 20 %). Half the population (48 / 96) had hearing impairment or were deaf. One-third of cats (35 / 96) had concurrent diseases, most likely reflecting the age distribution. <b>Birmans</b> were strongly represented (30 / 96). Levetiracetam gave good seizure control. The course of the epilepsy was non-progressive in the majority (68 / 96), with an improvement over time in some (23 / 96). Only 33 / 96 and 11 / 90 owners, respectively, felt the GTCSs and myoclonic seizures affected their cat’s quality of life (QoL). Despite this, many owners (50 / 96) reported a slow decline in their cat’s health, becoming less responsive (43 / 50), not jumping (41 / 50), becoming uncoordinated or weak in the pelvic limbs (24 / 50) and exhibiting dramatic weight loss (39 / 50). These signs were exclusively reported in cats experiencing seizures for > 2 years, with 42 / 50 owners stating these signs affected their cat’s QoL. Conclusions and relevance: In gathering data on audiogenic seizures in cats, we have identified a new epilepsy syndrome named FARS with a geriatric onset. Further studies are warranted to investigate potential genetic predispositions to this condition. © 2015, © ISFM and AAFP 2015...|$|R
