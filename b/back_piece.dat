500|$|The front two {{and back}} two legs were each cast as one piece, yet where a [...] deep socket was {{hollowed}} {{into the front}} piece, a [...] long pin extends down from the <b>back</b> <b>piece.</b> The resultant pin and socket design would allow the boar to be mounted on another object, particularly a helmet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here it is," [...] {{the surgeon}} said, {{producing}} a flattened bullet. The missile indeed had passed {{right through the}} body and had flattened against the <b>back</b> <b>piece,</b> which its force was too far spent to penetrate.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will leave}} my helmet and breast and <b>back</b> <b>piece</b> behind me," [...] he said, [...] "and {{will take your}} staff. Then, if I am caught sight of by any party in the distance, I shall look like a shepherd; while, had I on my iron harness, they would at once suspect me of being of the party, even though I were alone. As for you, your monk's robe would be detected, miles off." ...|$|E
50|$|The three needle bindoff {{is useful}} for joining the front and <b>back</b> <b>pieces</b> of a sweater.|$|R
50|$|The {{front and}} <b>back</b> <b>pieces</b> {{of a simple}} kurta are also rectangular. The side seams are left open for 6 - 12 in above the hem, which gives the wearer some ease of movement.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{will be an}} easy task, methinks; for I {{see that}} instead of being {{polished}} and bright, as were ours at Dunbar, the others keep their steel caps and <b>back</b> <b>pieces</b> painted a sombre colour." ...|$|R
60|$|As Philip {{had been}} {{furnished}} with money, {{he did not}} trouble the queen's chamberlain, but at once purchased clothes {{for himself and his}} three followers, together with breast and <b>back</b> <b>piece</b> for Jacques and Roger. On his return to the queen, after an hour's absence, he was informed that Prince Henri had made inquiries for him, and was shown into a room where the young prince was sitting down to his breakfast, the queen being engaged in business with some of her councillors.|$|E
60|$|It was not {{necessary}} to purchase many articles of clothing, for the dress {{of the people of}} Holland differed little from that of the English. Ned bought a thick buff jerkin to wear under his armour, and had little difficulty in buying steel cap, breast and <b>back</b> <b>piece,</b> sword and pistols; for the people of Holland had not as yet begun to arm generally, and many of the walls were defended by burghers in their citizen dress, against the mail clad pikemen of Spain.|$|E
60|$|Malcolm now {{returned}} with Colonel Munro to the regiment, {{and there had}} to give a full and minute account of his adventures, and was warmly congratulated by his fellow officers on his good fortune in escaping from the dangers which had beset him. The suit of armour was a handsome one, and had been doubtless stripped off {{from the body of}} some knight or noble murdered by the freebooters. The leg pieces Malcolm laid aside, retaining only a cuirass, <b>back</b> <b>piece,</b> and helmet, as the full armour was too heavy for service on foot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall I go {{into the}} village {{and find out what}} has taken place, Monsieur Fletcher? I will leave my iron cap and breast and <b>back</b> <b>pieces</b> here. I shall not want to fight but to run, and a hare could not run in these iron pots." ...|$|R
60|$|Their <b>back</b> <b>pieces</b> now {{served the}} troopers in good stead, as did their {{superior}} personal strength. Some beat their assailants down {{on to the}} pommel of their saddles, and throttled or stabbed them; while in many cases, where they were hard pressed, the sword of a comrade rid them from their foes.|$|R
60|$|Malcolm {{drew his}} other pistol and again fired, this time more effectually, {{for the ball}} struck between the {{shoulder}} and the neck at the junction of the breast and <b>back</b> <b>pieces,</b> and passed down {{into the body of}} the Austrian, who, dropping the petard, fell dead; but a number of his men were close behind him.|$|R
60|$|He flung off his helmet, unbuckled the {{fastenings}} of his breast plate and <b>back</b> <b>piece,</b> undid the belt of his sword, and leaped in. As {{he rose to}} the surface he heard a merry laugh beside him, and saw the girl swimming quietly close by. Although mortified at having so hastily assumed that {{she was unable to}} take care of herself he joined in her laugh, and swam by her side until they reached the bank some distance down. Encumbered by the trappings which he still retained, Malchus had far more difficulty than the girl in gaining the shore.|$|E
60|$|Three suits {{of clothes}} were ordered {{for each of}} them: the one such as that worn by pages in noble {{families}} upon ordinary occasions, another of a much richer kind for special ceremonies and gaieties, the third a strong, serviceable suit for use when actually in the field. Then they were taken to an armourer's where each was provided with a light morion or head piece, breast plate and <b>back</b> <b>piece,</b> sword and dagger. A sufficient supply of under garments, boots, and other necessaries were also purchased; and when all was complete they returned highly delighted to the house. It was still scarce five o'clock, and they went across to the abbey and wandered for some time through its aisles, greatly impressed with its dignity and beauty now that their own affairs were off their mind.|$|E
60|$|It occurs perhaps once {{or twice}} in one's {{lifetime}} that one passes through great happenings--sometimes of joy, sometimes of dreadful bitterness--in just such a dazed state as Myles passed through this. It is only afterwards that all comes back to one so sharply and keenly that the heart thrills almost in agony in living it over again. But perhaps of all {{the memory of that}} time, when it afterwards came <b>back</b> <b>piece</b> by piece, none was so clear to Myles's back-turned vision as the long night spent in the chapel, watching his armor, thinking such wonderful thoughts, and dreaming such wonderful wide-eyed dreams. At such times Myles saw again the dark mystery of the castle chapel; he saw again the half-moon gleaming white and silvery through the tall, narrow window, and throwing a broad form of still whiteness across stone floor, empty seats, and still, motionless figures of stone effigies. At such times he stood again in front of the twinkling tapers that lit the altar where his armor lay piled in a heap, heard again the deep breathing of his companions of the watch sleeping in some empty stall, wrapped each in his cloak, and saw the old chandler bestir himself, and rise and come forward to snuff the candles. At such times he saw again the day growing clearer and clearer through the tall, glazed windows, saw it change to a rosy pink, and then to a broad, ruddy glow that threw a halo of light around Father Thomas's bald head bowed in sleep, and lit up the banners and trophies hanging motionless against the stony face of the west wall; heard again the stirring of life without and the sound of his companions arousing themselves; saw them come forward, and heard them wish him joy that his long watch was ended.|$|E

50|$|With Hitler that changed: {{funds were}} made {{available}} for scholars to make great advancements beyond their neighboring countries. Under Nazi rule, archaeology went from having one chair in prehistory in Marburg in 1933 to having nine chairs in the Reich in 1935. Once archaeology started gaining popularity, scholars were also able to excavate castles, old ruins and the like, and bring <b>back</b> <b>pieces</b> for display in museums.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can provide}} that," [...] Ralph replied, [...] "seeing that his worshipful the lord-mayor {{bestowed}} upon me yesterday five gold pieces {{as the second}} in command in the sports. I have already a steel cap and breast and <b>back</b> <b>pieces,</b> which I have made for myself in hours of leisure, and warrant will stand as hard a knock as the Frenchmen can give them." ...|$|R

50|$|In {{a suit of}} armour, the cuirass was {{generally}} connected to a <b>back</b> <b>piece.</b> Cuirass could also refer to the complete torso-protecting armour.|$|E
5|$|Early blades {{have been}} {{documented}} {{as far back as}} 550-500,000 years in the Kapthurin Formation in Kenya and Kathu Pan in South Africa. <b>Backed</b> <b>pieces</b> from the Twin Rivers and Kalambo Falls sites in Zambia, dated at sometime between 300 and 140,000 years, likewise indicate a suite of new behaviors. A high level of technical competence is also indicated for the c. 280 ka blades recovered from the Kapthurin Formation, Kenya.|$|R
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} a clothier arrived with several suits of handsome material and make, out of sober colours, {{such as a}} young man of good family would wear, and an armourer brought him a morion and breast and <b>back</b> <b>pieces</b> of steel, handsomely inlaid with gold. When he was alone he attired himself in the quietest of his new suits, and looking {{at himself in the mirror}} burst into a fit of hearty laughter.|$|R

5000|$|This watch has a {{screw-in}} back. It has {{a series}} of five holes/notches evenly placed around the back. These are the indentations for the screw-back case opener tool to grip the <b>back</b> <b>piece</b> open and close it.|$|E
5000|$|The front two {{and back}} two legs were each cast as one piece, yet where a 3.5 mm deep socket was {{hollowed}} {{into the front}} piece, a 6 mm long pin extends down from the <b>back</b> <b>piece.</b> The resultant pin and socket design [...] "would be consistent with ... being mounted or fixed on some other object", particularly a helmet.|$|E
50|$|The uniforms were {{custom made}} for each Bunny {{at the club}} they worked in. Whenever the club was open there was a {{full-time}} seamstress on duty. The costumes were stocked in two pieces, the front part being pre-sewn in different bra cup sizes such as B or C cup. The seamstress would match the Bunnies' figure to the correct fitting front and <b>back</b> <b>pieces.</b> Then the two pieces were sewn together to fit each person perfectly.|$|R
40|$|This {{symposium}} volume {{gives the}} state of the art in the research on ant-plant interactions. A lot of new data and insights are presented. A thematic grouping of the chapters divides the book into six parts. The first part deals with antagonistic interactions, i. e., the leaf-cutter ants. It appears that leaf-cutters collect a diversity of material, diluting the effect of toxic allelochemicals. They may collect quite inappropriate material; they have been reported to cut and bring <b>back</b> <b>pieces</b> from plastic labels...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my boy, you had best {{spend an}} hour in {{cleaning}} up your father's armour and arms. The steel cap {{must go to the}} armourer at Alwinton, for repair; but you can get some of the dints out of his breast and <b>back</b> <b>pieces,</b> and can give them a fresh coat of black paint;" [...] for the borderers usually darkened their armour so that, in their raids, their presence should not be betrayed by the glint of sun or moon upon them.|$|R

5000|$|Gussets {{are also}} used when making three-piece bags, for example in a pattern [...] a bag as a long, wide piece which connects the front piece and <b>back</b> <b>piece.</b> By {{becoming}} the sides {{and bottom of the}} bag, the gusset opens the bag up beyond what simply attaching the front to the back would do. With reference to the dimension of the gusset, the measurements of a flat bottom bag may be quoted as LxWxG.|$|E
50|$|Asteroid Belt is Velvet Chain's fifth album. It was {{released}} in November 2003 under the Freak Records label. It is a mix between trip-hop/electronica and jazz. It has a very {{out of this world}} feel to it, with many references to outer space in song titles and lyrics, sci-fi style noises in the background, as well using pictures of celestial bodies in the liner notes. This theme fits in well with both the electronica style songs as well as the more laid <b>back</b> <b>pieces.</b>|$|R
60|$|Without {{waiting for}} an answer, he told six men, who were eating their breakfast at the farther end of the room, to make an end of their meal, and get on their steel caps and breast and <b>back</b> <b>pieces,</b> and take their places in the turret over the gate into the yard. In {{a few minutes the}} animals began to pour in, first those of the homestead, then the {{captured}} herd, weary and exhausted with their long and hurried journey; then came the master, with his followers.|$|R
