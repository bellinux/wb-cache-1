5|$|The Vaishnava {{movement}} in the Kannada-speaking regions found momentum after {{the arrival of the}} philosopher Ramanujacharya (1017–1137). Fleeing possible persecution from the Chola King (who was a Shaiva), Ramanujacharya sought refuge initially in Tondanur and later moved to Melkote. But this event had no impact on Vaishnava literature in Hoysala lands at that time. However, the teachings of Madhvacharya (1238–1317), propounder of the Dvaita philosophy, did have a direct impact on Vaishnava literature, in both the Sanskrit and Kannada languages. This <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>writings</b> is known as haridasa sahitya (haridasa literature).|$|E

25|$|Literally, {{it belongs}} to the “testaments”, an {{apocryphal}} <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>writings</b> which were compiled to preserve the teachings and the histories of great, usually Biblical, figures whose names they bear. Within this group the Testament of Job is, in its general complexion, more related to the Testament of The Twelve Patriarchs, while, like the Testament of Moses, it is characterized by a close adherence to the Bible text. Each constitute a haggadic commentary upon a canonical book – in other words, a midrash.|$|E

5000|$|She married John Adams, Sr. in 1734.

The earliest extant work in Bengali literature is the Charyapada, {{a collection of}} Buddhist mystic songs {{dating back to the}} 10th and 11th centuries.

2500|$|Aristotle of Stagira {{is widely}} {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the most important and influential philosophical thinkers of all time. [...] The first sentence of his Metaphysics reads: [...] "All men by nature desire to know." [...] He has, therefore, been called the [...] "Father of those who know." [...] His medieval disciple Thomas Aquinas referred to him simply as [...] "the Philosopher". Aristotle was a student at Plato's Academy, and like his teacher, he wrote dialogues, or conversations. However, none of these exist today. The <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>writings</b> that has come down to the present probably represents lectures that he delivered at his own school in Athens, the Lyceum. Even from these books, the enormous range of his interests is evident: He explored matters other than those that are today considered philosophical; the extant treatises cover logic, the physical and biological sciences, ethics, politics, and constitutional government. Among Aristotle's most notable works are Politics, Nicomachean Ethics, Poetics, On the Soul, and Rhetoric.|$|E
6000|$|Just what motive caused Defoe {{to write}} A Vindication of the Press is not clear. Unlike his earlier An Essay on the Regulation of the Press (1704), A Vindication {{does not seem}} to have been occasioned by a {{specific}} situation, and in it Defoe is not alone concerned with freedom of the press, but writes on a more general and discursive level. His opening paragraph states that [...] "The very great Clamour against some late Performances of Authorship, and the unprecedented Criticisms introduc'd" [...] make such an essay as he writes [...] "absolutely necessary." [...] Yet there is no clear indication of just what works occasion this necessity. The ironic reference to Mr. Dennis at the end of the first paragraph, taken together with the praise of Mr. Pope's translation of Homer and the allusion to [...] "the malicious and violent Criticisms of a certain Gentleman in its Disfavour" [...] [p. 23], might suggest that Defoe had in mind Dennis' Remarks upon Mr. Pope's Translation of Homer, but even the entire <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>writings</b> attacking Pope's Homer would hardly seem sufficient to give point to this somewhat omnibus and unfocused essay.|$|E

50|$|Maximilan II died in 1576, {{and the new}} emperor Rudolph II {{was much}} less sympathetic, {{becoming}} convinced that Palaeologus was spying for the Ottoman Empire and possibly Poland too.

5000|$|The {{obituary}} {{is often}} cited as a pivotal point in Hamsun's expression of his own political views, severely affecting the reception <b>of</b> his complete <b>body</b> <b>of</b> works. <b>Writings</b> such as these rose somewhat in importance {{due to the fact}} that the praised novelist Hamsun had not released a work of fiction since 1936's The Ring is Closed. Biographer Ingar Sletten Kolloen has referred to the obituary as one of [...] "four mortal sins" [...] committed by Hamsun which came to erode his position in Norwegian post-war society. On the other hand, Jørgen Haugan at the University of Copenhagen has stated regret that Hamsun's wrongdoings, among others the obituary of Hitler, had not overshadowed his literary qualities to what Haugan deems to be a sufficient degree.|$|R

25|$|Ecclesiastes {{has taken}} its {{literary}} form from the Middle Eastern tradition of the fictional autobiography, in which a character, often a king, relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical: Kohelet likewise identifies himself as a king, speaks of his search for wisdom, relates his conclusions, and recognises his limitations. It belongs to the category of wisdom literature, the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> biblical <b>writings</b> which give advice on life, together with reflections on its problems and meanings—other examples include the Book of Job, Proverbs, {{and some of the}} Psalms. Ecclesiastes differs from the other biblical Wisdom books in being deeply skeptical of the usefulness of Wisdom itself. Ecclesiastes in turn influenced the deuterocanonical works, Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach, both of which contain vocal rejections of the Ecclesiastical philosophy of futility.|$|R
