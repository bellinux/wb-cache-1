So I know they're not gonna make that mistake again. They're gonna wait until May. Colantoni also expressed optimism towards the show's future on The CW, believing that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for the show to get more exposure. On May 15, before the official press release was announced, it was believed that The CW had ordered 13 episodes of Veronica Mars. Later, it was revealed that the series had been renewed for a 22-episode season, but that the season could be shortened if ratings were poor.|$|E
500|$|After battle sequences, {{the player}} {{will have the}} {{opportunity}} to rebuild their units by allocating a quantity of armament supplies, such as air support, which can be issued to any friendly unit on the map. After rebuilding ground units, the game will move onto an [...] "air phase", which consists of commanding aircraft such as aeroplanes, bombers and a limited number of reserve air units. Several options for allocating air forces include: counter air strikes, reconnaissance on enemy movement, interdiction, assault breakers, and deep strikes. Counter air strikes involve attacks on enemy air bases, whereas interdiction involves aircraft being sent behind enemy lines in order to attack supply and movement networks. If interdiction aircraft are discovered in enemy territory, there will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that the side will respond with a retaliatory nuclear strike. The remaining three aircraft options are to attack a single unit, strike enemy territory, and attack railways in order to disable enemy reinforcements, respectively.|$|E

Should the Dover defile be lost, he concluded, the Royal Navy could do little to interrupt the flow of German supplies and reinforcements across the Channel, at least by day, and he further warned that [...] "…there might really <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that they (the Germans) might be able to bring a serious weight of attack to bear on this country".

Ebert talked to Major Kurt von Schleicher, who promised to have loyal troops from the environs of Berlin come to Ebert's help. He also expressed his hope that this would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to [...] "finally strike a blow against the radicals". Regular troops from Potsdam and Babelsberg were mobilised and marched towards Berlin.

Due to a misunderstanding caused by Kai Qi's father he mistook her for conning him and shows hatred for her even though he still loves her very much.

When he and Kai Qi reconcile their friendship, he hopes their relationship will move beyond being just friends, but she comes clean that she has feelings for Ah Jie and only want to be friends, which he abides by. Never really confessing his feelings to Kai Qi he relates to Schrödinger's cat theory as hope that there might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for the both of them to be together if she does not give him a reject answer even though he knows that her heart belongs to Ah Jie. When he finally confesses his feelings to Kai Qi she rejects him. Finally getting an answer from Kai Qi he gives up his job as a food critic and pursues his real interest in astronomy.|$|E

Having bet virtually all of his money {{on the outcome of}} a Philadelphia Eagles game, he asks Pat to attend as a [...] "good-luck charm". Danny is eventually released from the clinic, and teaches Pat and Tiffany some new dance moves for their routine. [...] Pat asks Tiffany for time off from practice to attend the game. She gives him a typed reply from Nikki, in which she cautiously hints there may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for reconciliation between them. Before he gets into the stadium, Pat gets involved in a fight when some racist fans harass the Indian fans there including his therapist Dr. Patel, and is hauled away by the police. The Eagles lose the game and Patrizio is furious. Tiffany shows up at their house and points out that the way she is [...] "reading the signs," [...] Philadelphia teams do better when she and Pat are together. Convinced, Patrizio makes a parlay with his gambling friend: if the Eagles win their next game and Tiffany and Pat score 5 out of 10 in their dance competition, he will win back double the money he lost on the first bet. Pat is reluctant, and Tiffany, Dolores, and Patrizio conspire to persuade Pat to dance in the competition by telling him that Nikki will be there; it is revealed that his parents have secretly supported Tiffany's attempts to get along with him. Pat notices that the letter from Nikki also refers to [...] "reading the signs" [...] and realizes that Tiffany wrote it.|$|E
2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Kelly Souders {{explained that}} the loss of show creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, as well as series regulars Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk {{at the end of the}} seventh season, forced the creative team to look at the show from a new angle. As Souders explained, it allowed the writers to work with [...] "blank slates", and come up with ways to [...] "reinvigorate and reinvent the show". Executive producer Darren Swimmer explained that this season would feature Chloe's powers manifesting in a way that they have not previously been seen. He went on to express that the theme of season eight would be [...] "double identity"; specifically, Swimmer explained that Clark would begin to understand that he is going to have to live a double life, or he will never be able to continue forward with his destiny. Season eight would be about Clark moving forward to his destiny in a way that the show has never attempted before. Swimmer further explained that Clark will be acting more with his superpowers, whereas previously he would [...] "react" [...] to the situation; [...] "he's going to seek out trouble." [...] Clark joined the Daily Planet to help his cause, using the Planet as a means to get information about where there is trouble. Clark's heroic actions put him in Jimmy's sights, who starts connecting things to Clark; this helped fuel Clark's decision to develop a [...] "secret identity". Another reason for Clark's decision to develop a secret identity will be the stark contrast between saving people in the secluded streets of Smallville, and saving people in the crowded streets of Metropolis. While working at the Daily Planet, Clark was paired up with Lois on various assignments. Lois Lane actress Erica Durance, explained the episodes would be more focused on her character than they have been in the past, and that Lois and Clark would be both rivals and supportive partners to each other. Durance also revealed that Lois would begin to realize her true romantic feelings for Clark, but that she does not want him to know the truth because she does not know what she wants to do with those feelings. Season eight explored these romantic notions between the two characters. Jeph Loeb added that season eight would explore more of the DC Comics mythology, and would introduce new characters, as well as expand on already existing ones in Smallville continuity. Peterson also revealed that there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that the show would break the [...] "No flights, no tights" [...] rule, at least in regard to the flying part of the rule.|$|E
