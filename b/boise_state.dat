The game was the final competition of the 2007 football season for each team and resulted in a 41–38 East Carolina victory, even though sportsbooks favored <b>Boise</b> <b>State</b> to win by 10½ points. Many experts believed East Carolina to be big underdogs to <b>Boise</b> <b>State,</b> which had defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl.

Because of that season-ending victory and the Hokies' general good performance during the 2009 season, Virginia Tech was ranked No. 10 in preseason national polling. The Hokies' {{first game of the}} season was a nationally televised contest against then-No. 3 <b>Boise</b> <b>State</b> at FedExField near Washington, D.C.. Because the game {{was the first of the}} season to feature two top-10 teams, it received large amounts of media coverage. During the game, Virginia Tech fell behind 17–0 in the first quarter, but rallied to take a 21–20 lead early in the third quarter.

5|$|A U.S. Weather Bureau Airport Station was {{established}} at the downtown Boise Airport, now the campus of <b>Boise</b> <b>State</b> University, on May 11, 1933 which is only about a 1-mile south of the U.S. Federal Building. Weather observations {{had been taken from}} the airport by the Bureau of Air Commerce personal since October 18, 1931.
