"I {{realized}} it was the applause of the fans that really kept me going. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{be ready to go}} onstage and just be crying hysterically not understanding even how I was feeling. I was feeling very dizzy, I had a lot of vertigo, I had pain but it's like fuck if I know what hurts the most because I'd been on tour for a year. But I didn't want to let them down and I just couldn't cancel because the thought of leaving 50,000 kids in the arena just broke my heart. So I went out every night and I played and I played and I played until I couldn't walk one night." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{planning}} to perform [...] "Frozen" [...] in Werchter? I didn't expect anything else, you know. I don't even mind. It just {{would be nice}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> finally get some money after all these years, because the case is still going on. I'm {{certainly not going to}} the concert. My lawyer is following the case. I'm really going to follow Madonna's concert with interest, because she really can't perform the song. Yet, I think we won't immediately take steps. The court's decision is subject to various interpretations. The song can't be played on the radio or be sold, but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over? We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E

"No, no; nonsense," [...] said Kate, rather affronted; [...] "but {{they wanted}} to make me forget all that I cared for, and they really did shut me up <b>because</b> <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not write a {{falsehood}} to please them!

500|$|In a 1975 interview, Dufek noted {{his love}} of both sports: [...] "There are times when I've thought of {{dropping}} one or the other, but heck, I've been doing this since high school {{and it would be}} pretty tough to quit them both now." [...] Dufek added: [...] "Hockey is a more relaxed thing. [...] It's a smaller atmosphere and {{you have to deal with}} only one or two coaches. [...] You can be more individual and flashy. [...] Football has certain assignments and you can't really express yourself." [...] In the end, however, Dufek chose the NFL over the NHL. [...] He explained: [...] "I've decided to pursue professional football <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> probably have an extensive tour in the hockey minor leagues and I don't want that." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1979, de Lucía, John McLaughlin, and Larry Coryell formed The Guitar Trio and {{together}} made {{a tour of}} Europe and released a video recorded at London's Royal Albert Hall entitled Meeting of the Spirits. Pohren said that de Lucía's decision to work with musicians like McLaughlin, Di Meola, Coryell, and Chick Corea {{must have been an}} [...] "exciting and stimulating" [...] experience for him, given their technical musical knowledge and ability to improvise and said that they carried him [...] "so far afield that at times he must have been profoundly confused, a man running the risk of losing his musical identity." [...] This concerned de Lucía, who said in a late 1990s interview, [...] "I have never lost the roots in my music, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> lose myself. What I have tried to do is have a hand holding onto tradition and the other scratching, digging in other places, trying to find new things I can bring into flamenco." ...|$|E
500|$|The couplet {{summarizes}} the sonnet in two lines, [...] "Therefore, like her, I sometime hold my tongue, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not dull {{you with my}} song". This is a clear statement from the poet vocalizing for the final time {{that he will not}} dull, bore, or represent his muse in a tedious way by creating a sonnet as exhausted and cliched as his contemporaries. In his analysis of the couplet, Stephen Booth compares the couplet to a proverb: [...] "My desire is not to dull you, if I cannot delight you." [...] Booth suggests that the poet does not wish to make his lover seem common with overabundant praise. Aitkins similarly suggests that the poet does not wish his praises to become annoying. Helen Vendler suggests that the poet uses proverbial language here to address the Fair Youth's seeming obsession with receiving praise; a personal plea would fall on deaf ears, so he makes his case rather impersonal.|$|E

500|$|Chelsea {{made their}} {{eleventh}} {{appearance in the}} Community Shield; prior to this they won four (1970, 2000, 2005, 2009) and lost six, most recently in 2012 against Manchester City. By contrast, Arsenal made their 21st Community Shield appearance, and won 13, including one shared in 1991. They went into the match as holders of the Shield, having defeated Manchester City a year earlier. Both clubs had only once met before in the Shield, when Chelsea won by two goals to one in 2005. Arsenal had failed to beat Chelsea in all competitions since 2011, and [...] Mourinho was undefeated against his opponent Arsène Wenger in 13 matches. Mourinho told reporters a winless run was something he would not tolerate: “I would try to answer, not because of a mental block but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{want to try to}} find solutions to help my team to do it – try to find a different way, try to find the reasons why it goes all the time against my team." [...] He also attempted to play down the significance of the match, given Arsenal had won the previous year's contest but finished third in the league.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{consistently}} warm reception towards Cox and her character, {{some aspects}} of Monica's characterization have been criticized. The second season episode [...] "The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies" [...] sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment {{in order to have}} sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross. In her book Narratives, Health, and Healing: Communication Theory, Research, and Practice, author Lynn M. Harter defended the storyline, arguing that it promotes safe sex. Rachel eventually wins the condom in a game of rock, paper, scissors, forcing Monica to abstain for the night. Monica's overweight alter-ego [...] "Fat Monica" [...] has often been accused of being an offensive stereotype of overweight women exploited for laughs. Although identifying a formerly overweight character as [...] "a standard TV trope", the New Statesman's Bim Adewunmi wrote that Fat Monica [...] "always struck a weird note" [...] with the writer despite the show's efforts [...] "to pinpoint a solid and satisfying back-story for the character". Megan Kirby of xoJane questioned the negative effect the show's fat jokes would have on its overweight viewers, writing, [...] "What does this mean for the girls like me who never become thin? Are we relegated to side roles and stereotypes in our own lives? Of course, this isn’t true. But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn’t get to be the protagonist." [...] Emma Tarver of Feminspire complained that Fat Monica [...] "made me think as a child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> just disgust every man I looked at." [...] Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of Refinery29 received Fat Monica positively as [...] "proof I could overcome my disgusting plumpness and be seen as lovable, too". In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four flashback episodes, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a doughnut while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience. Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show's episodes, and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an internet meme.|$|E

2500|$|A Writers' Guild {{arbitration}} process awarded Washburn sole [...] "Screenplay by" [...] credit.

[...] Cimino contested {{the results of the}} arbitration. [...] "In their Nazi wisdom," [...] added Cimino, [...] " [...] didn't give me the credit <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be producer, director and writer." [...] All four writers—Cimino, Washburn, Garfinkle, and Redeker—received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay for the film.|$|E
2500|$|Radner battled bulimia {{while on}} the show. She had a {{relationship}} with SNL castmate Bill Murray, with whom she worked at the National Lampoon, and that ended badly. Few details of their relationship or its end were made public. In It's Always Something, this is the one reference Radner made to Murray in the entire book: [...] "All the guys [...] liked to have me around <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> laugh at them till I peed in my pants and tears rolled out of my eyes. We worked together {{for a couple of years}} creating The National Lampoon Show, writing The National Lampoon Radio Hour, and even working on stuff for the magazine.

2500|$|In-flight {{director}} John Ferruggio recalled, [...] "We {{were ready}} for take off in Amsterdam, and the aircraft {{came to an abrupt}} stop {{in the middle of the}} runway. And Captain Priddy called me up into the cockpit and says, 'I'd like to have a word with you.' I went up to the cockpit, and he says, 'We have two passengers by the name of Diop and Gueye.' He says, 'Go down and try to find them in the manifest, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to have a word with them.' ... So Captain Priddy sat them down at these two seats over here. He gave them a pretty good pat. They had a Styrofoam container in their groin area where they carried the grenade, and the 25-mm pistols. But this we found out much later." ...|$|E

If I found I didn't like him, I'd leave him even after the altar. I'd leave him any time I found I didn't like him.

2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{difficulties}} with sampling, {{the band and}} production team eventually became comfortable with it, even sampling Mullen's drumming, the Edge's guitar riffs, Clayton's bass lines, and Bono's vocalisations. Howie B sampled almost anything he could {{in order to find}} interesting sounds. He created sequenced patterns of the Edge's guitar playing, which the guitarist, having never done it before, found very interesting. Howie B explained, [...] "Sometimes I would sample, say, a guitar, but it wouldn't come back sounding like a guitar; it might sound more like a pneumatic drill, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> take the raw sound and filter it, really destroy the guitar sound, and rebuild it into something completely different." [...] Although sequencing was used, mostly on keyboards, guitar loops, and some percussion, it was used sparingly out of fear of becoming overreliant on it.|$|E
2500|$|Summers then {{concluded}} {{his discussion}} of the three hypotheses by saying: [...] So my best guess, to provoke you, of what's behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon, by far, is the general clash between people's legitimate family desires and employers' current desire for high power and high intensity, that in the special case of science and engineering, there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude, and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination. I would like nothing better than to be proved wrong, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are, and working very hard to address them. Summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in high-end science and engineering positions.|$|E
2500|$|On 2015 Simpson is {{concentrating on}} a new album and {{developing}} a [...] "Live In Session" [...] experience - [...] "a new way to present the music live based around {{the idea of being}} in the centre of the dancefloor and at eye level... I am looking to create a space which mimics the studio environment – not only that – <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be in the centre of the dancefloor so I can monitor everything around me and be at the same level – eye-level with the presumed dancer. This way it makes it easy for me to create the atmosphere and the rhythm suitable for the individual dancefloor. Kind of like an open kitchen in a restaurant – it’s an open kitchen in a club bringing the food to the people instantly – as soon as it’s produced it’s already on the dancefloor. What I’m looking for in 2015 is sound reproduction in the clubs being taken a lot more seriously than in the past." ...|$|E

He drew a picture of a woman to my back and made me stand in shameful position holding my buttocks." [...] "'Do you pray to Allah?' one asked. I said yes. They said, ' you. And [...] him.'

2500|$|He {{was five}} feet nine {{inches tall and}} was always very slender so that he {{appeared}} taller than he was actually…he had been a gymnast and the muscles of his arms and back stood out like ropes. [...] He was soft spoke and agreeable, yet, {{there was always a}} certain reserve. He was modest, honest, and true. He spoke well of others. As a boy he had gone to church twice on Sundays, once in the morning and once in the evening. He visited the sick and aged. [...] He loved games. He was an avid hunter and fisherman. [...] He was first a cavalryman before he became a flyer and he enjoyed riding and polo. In San Antonio, he had three polo ponies. I was never allowed to ride them, presumably <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> spoil them. He did, however, teach me to ride other horses, to swim, to golf, and to play baseball. [...] He enjoyed music and we sang on long automobile trips when he changed station from one Army post to another, my father and mother in the front seat and my sister, Barbara, and I in the back. [...] His posture was firmly erect and he possessed a cold courage that was remarkable. Beneath the calm exterior lay the competitiveness and combativeness fostered by the severe training at West Point.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, as lead guitarist, Barry Lyde {{joined a}} R group, The Impacts, which {{had formed a}} year earlier with Bob Dames on bass guitar, Mick Hadley on vocals, Fred Pickard on rhythm guitar and Adrian Redmond on drums. The Impacts {{supported}} The Rolling Stones 1965 tour of Australia and when they arrived in Melbourne found another group with the same name, so were renamed The Purple Hearts. They were named for the pep-pills (see purple hearts) favoured by band members – not the US military decoration of same name (see Purple Heart). Their debut recordings were covers of [...] "Gloria" [...] and Graham Bond's [...] "Long Legged Baby" [...] cut to acetate disc in 1965 at Soundtrack Studios, Brisbane. A different version of [...] "Long Legged Baby" [...] was issued as their debut single on Sunshine Records later in 1965. Their highest charting single, [...] "Early in the Morning", was released in October 1966 and peaked at No.24 on Go-Sets National Top40. The band briefly relocated to Sydney {{then moved on to}} Melbourne. They had issued three other singles and an extended play, The Sound of the Purple Hearts before splitting on 23 January 1967. [...] "Dames started calling me Lobby <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> lobby the fuck out of people ... My last name's' L-y-d-e, so he put the 'o' in because it rhymed better". 'Lobby' is also used in Queensland for a freshwater crayfish where other Australians would say 'yabby'.|$|E
