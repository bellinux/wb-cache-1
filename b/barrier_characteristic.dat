40|$|SummaryPancreatic acinar {{cells of}} adult mice (≥P 60) are {{resistant}} to transformation {{by some of the}} most robust oncogenic insults including expression of K-Ras oncogenes and loss of p 16 Ink 4 a/p 19 Arf or Trp 53 tumor suppressors. Yet, these acinar cells yield pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (mPanIN) and ductal adenocarcinomas (mPDAC) if exposed to limited bouts of non-acute pancreatitis, providing they harbor K-Ras oncogenes. Pancreatitis contributes to tumor progression by abrogating the senescence <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristic</b> of low-grade mPanINs. Attenuation of pancreatitis-induced inflammation also accelerates tissue repair and thwarts mPanIN expansion. Patients with chronic pancreatitis display senescent PanINs, providing they have received antiinflammatory drugs.

The present work systematically studied α-decay half-lives for the favored ground-state-to-ground-state transitions of 344 isotopes of nuclei with 52 <= Z <= 107 using 28 versions of the proximity potential model {{in the framework of}} the WKB approximation. The present study introduces the best proximity versions with the fewest deviations with respect to experimental values. The models for Prox. 77 -set 4, Prox. 77 -set 5, and Dutt 2011 with the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of < 1 were found to predict α-decay half-lives better than the other models. Comparison with fusion studies shows that Dutt 2011 is an appropriate model both for α-decay studies and for prediction of the <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristic</b> in heavy-ion fusion reactions. The calculation of α-decay half-lives were repeated for even-even, even-odd, odd-even, and odd-odd nuclei.

40|$|<b>Barrier</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{of brain}} endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are tightly {{regulated}} by cellular and acellular {{components of the}} neurovascular unit. During embryogenesis, the accumulation of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin in the basement membranes ensheathing brain vessels correlates with BBB maturation. In contrast, loss of agrin deposition in the vasculature of brain tumors is accompanied {{by the loss of}} endothelial junctional proteins. We therefore wondered whether agrin had a direct effect on the <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristics</b> of brain endothelial cells. Agrin increased junctional localization of vascular endothelial (VE) -cadherin, β-catenin, and zonula occludens- 1 (ZO- 1) but not of claudin- 5 and occludin in the brain endothelioma cell line bEnd 5 without affecting the expression levels of these proteins. This was accompanied by an agrin-induced reduction of the paracellular permeability of bEnd 5 monolayers. In vivo, the lack of agrin also led to reduced junctional localization of VE-cadherin in brain microvascular endothelial cells. Taken together, our data support the notion that agrin contributes to <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristics</b> of brain endothelium by stabilizing the adherens junction proteins VE-cadherin and β-catenin and the junctional protein ZO- 1 to brain endothelial junctions...|$|R

By incorporating a 20 nm TaN interlayer between a Ti pre-orienting layer and the silicon substrate, we eliminated the potential barrier for carrier injection and phonon transport, and inhibited the formation of interfacial silicide that led to device failure. Compared to previous reports on metal substrate, we achieved a 16 × reduction in root-mean-square (RMS) roughness, from 24 nm to 1. 6 nm, for the samples with the Ti/TaN metal-bilayer, owing to the effective diffusion <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristic</b> of TaN.

Soil seed bank and seed rain composition, density and richness were investigated at three areas of different stages of invasion: (i) recent (8 – 10 years), (ii) mature (15 – 16 years) and (iii) long-term (25 years). There were few changes in seed bank composition or richness regardless of invasion stage.

Some prominent herbs from the native vegetation were under-represented or absent from the seed bank, both in invaded and uninvaded areas.

The majority of herbaceous and shrub species were capable of resprouting vegetatively. Therefore, regeneration appeared more reliant on the bud and tuber bank than a persistent soil seed bank.

40|$|Summary: Lymph is {{the minute}} net volume of contending {{hydrostatic}} and osmotic capillary forces. It is built up extravasculary in tissues and reaches the intravasal space by definite lymph collecting vessels, which enter the venous System at the angulus venosus {{at the root}} of the neck. Sampling methods for lymph from individual tissues or from lymph collecting vessels of man and various animals afe cited and the preparation of lymph for enzymatic analysis is described. The extracellular distribution and transport of enzymes is important for diag-nostic enzymology, because enzymes released from cells in continuous physiological processes, or after injury to the tissue, reach the intravasal space mainly via the lymphatics. This is evident from the high lymph-plasma ratios of diagnostically important enzymes. The type of enzyme transport (lymphatic or by direct interstitial-venous entry) depends on the heterogeneity of the capillary <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the different organs. The permeability is extremely high in liver, i. e. enzymes in hepatic lymph originale mainly from blood, which they have reached through the large openings in the sinusoidal endothelial lining; in contrast the permeability is extremely low in skeletal muscle, where lymphatic transport therefore predominates.

Epidermal thickness was measured by confocal reflectance microscopy (CRM), and other skin conditions (transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin pigmentation, SC hydration and sebum content) were analyzed using a multifunctional skin physiology monitor. SC lipids were extracted from the inner forearms by a cup method. Malaysians had the thickest epidermis, followed by Koreanand Vietnamese. The analysis of skin barrier function expressed in TEWL showed that Malaysian had the weakest skin barrier function compared to that of Vietnamese and Koreans.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{optimize}} the geometry and the acoustic properties of sound barriers for traffic noise applications. The approach consisted of developing and validating boundary element predictive models, which were subsequently exercised in order to refine the <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristic</b> and determine optimized configurations. The simple geometry of a circular disk was chosen to validate the boundary element model in the first part of this work. Experiments were performed in an anechoic chamber to validate the numerical model. Complex barrier geometries were then investigated to study the effects of geometry on sound barrier performance. Boundary element models were used to quantify the accuracy of existing, approximate diffraction-based models. Diffraction-based models have been widely applied in noise control engineering applications owing to their relative ease of use. Recent research suggests that multi-path diffraction components should be summed on a phase-coherent basis instead of on an energy basis. The accuracy of a phase-coherent diffraction model has been verified against the boundary element solution and the limitations of the diffraction model are discussed for both the case of infinite length barriers and barriers of finite length. A new barrier performance metric, based on the sound power propagating within the shadow zone was also investigated. It was found that variation of barrier geometry while maintaining the surface area constant did not yield any meaningful difference in the sound power propagating within the shadow zone. The performance of straight-edge barriers with various top geometries and sound absorptive treatments was then investigated. Experiments were performed using a finite size barrier in an anechoic chamber to verify the boundary element model. Good agreement was obtained between the results from the numerical model and the experimental data. The most important finding was that absorptive treatment applied to the top of a barrier was more effective at reducing sound levels in the shadow zone than a simple increase of barrier height. The use of the boundary element method to calculate the new barrier sound power performance metric is also discussed in connection with the complex geometry. It is shown that the propagating sound power calculated on a recovery plane in the barrier shadow zone provides a more effective performance measure than insertion loss when comparing the performance of different barrier designs...|$|E
40|$|Pancreatic {{cancer is}} {{responsible}} for nearly 40, 000 deaths in the U. S. annually, with a dismal 5 -year survival rate below 7 %. The poor therapeutic outcomes reflect a paucity of new approaches targeting the genomic underpinnings of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC, {{the vast majority of}} pancreatic cancers) as well as our inability to overcome the desmoplastic stromal <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristic</b> of PDAC. RNA interference through siRNA holds promise in targeting key mutations driving PDAC, such as oncogenic KRAS; however, a nucleic acid delivery vehicle that homes to PDAC and breaches the stroma does not yet exist. Noting that the novel cyclic peptide iRGD mediates tumor targeting and penetration through interactions with [alpha][upsilon][beta] 3 / 5 integrins and neuropilin- 1, we hypothesized that "tandem" peptides combining a cell-penetrating peptide and iRGD can complex with siRNA to form tumor-penetrating nanocomplexes (TPNs) effective in delivering siRNA to PDAC. Such a nanoscale carrier could provide a practical means of bridging our understanding of PDAC as a genetic disease to the clinic. Furthermore, the modular aspect of these self-assembled particles permits them to accommodate alternate cargoes or targeting domains, and we have proposed that tandem peptide complexes could be extended to applications outside of RNA interference, particularly for the delivery of components for CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated gene editing. This delivery system could be applied to generate improved animal models of pancreatic cancer. In this work, we first designed, characterized, and optimized iRGD-based TPNs for RNAi in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro, showing robust knockdown of single and multiple targets. In order to stabilize these nanoparticles for systemic administration, we then devised and compared diverse, non-covalent materials for formulating TPNs with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The best material in this capacity, a peptide-PEG conjugate, reduced accumulation of TPNs in off-target organs and improved circulation kinetics, while preserving functional knockdown capacity. Incorporating this approach with the iRGD tandem peptides, we studied the translational potential of PEGylated iRGD TPNs to deliver siRNA to various models of pancreatic cancer and have begun therapeutic testing with siRNA targeting KRAS. Finally, we have adapted the tandem peptide platform to mediate delivery of CRISPR/Cas 9 components. Particle configurations to deliver guide RNA alone, guide RNA with a DNA template for homology-directed repair, and guide RNA with Cas 9 protein have all shown efficacy in gene editing in vitro, important steps toward creating sporadic mutations to model PDAC. Thus, we have established a versatile approach to the delivery of nucleic acids for studying and treating pancreatic cancer. by Justin Han Je Lo. Thesis: Ph.

However, primary cultures limit {{the generation of}} material for molecular and biochemical assays since cells grow slowly, are prone to contamination by other neurovascular unit cells, and lose blood-brain <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristics</b> when passaged. To address these issues, immortalized cell lines have been generated. In these studies, we assessed the suitability of the immortalized mouse brain endothelial cell line, bEnd 3, as a blood-brain barrier model. RT-PCR and immunofluorescence indicated expression of multiple tight junction proteins. bEnd 3 cells formed barriers to radiolabeled sucrose, and responded like primary cultures to disrupting stimuli. Exposing cells to serum-free media on their basolateral side significantly decreased paracellular permeability; astrocyte-conditioned media did not enhance barrier properties. The serum-free media-induced decrease in permeability was correlated {{with an increase in}} claudin- 5 and zonula occludens- 1 immunofluorescence at cell-cell contracts. We conclude that bEnd 3 cells are an attractive candidate as a model of the blood-brain barrier due to their rapid growth, maintenance of blood-brain <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristics</b> over repeated passages, formation of functional barriers and amenability to numerous molecular interventions...|$|R
40|$|The {{blood-brain barrier}} (BBB) is {{essential}} for maintaining homeostasis within {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) and is a prerequisite for proper neuronal function. The BBB is localized to microvascular endothelial cells that strictly control the passage of metabolites {{into and out of the}} CNS. Complex and continuous tight junctions and lack of fenestrae combined with low pinocytotic activity make the BBB endothelium a tight barrier for water soluble moleucles. In combination with its expression of specific enzymes and transport molecules, the BBB endothelium is unique and distinguishable from all other endothelial cells in the body. During embryonic development, the CNS is vascularized by angiogenic sprouting from vascular networks originating outside of the CNS in a precise spatio-temporal manner. The particular <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristics</b> of BBB endothelial cells are induced during CNS angiogenesis by cross-talk with cellular and acellular elements within the developing CNS. In this review, we summarize the currently known cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating brain angiogenesis and introduce more recently discovered CNS-specific pathways (Wnt/β-catenin, Norrin/Frizzled 4 and hedgehog) and molecules (GPR 124) that are crucial in BBB differentiation and maturation. Finally, based on observations that BBB dysfunction is associated with many human diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke and brain tumors, we discuss recent insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in maintaining <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristics</b> in the mature BBB endothelium...|$|R
40|$|Wafer level bump {{technology}} that is compatible to III-V MMIC technology is reported. Two different wafer level bump technologies are presented in the paper. One is solder ball bump {{and the other is}} copper bump. Both are fully compatible with existing III-V MMIC backside manufacturing processes. Silicon nitride, deposited at room temperature, is used as solder mask and shows excellent solder blocking capability. UBM (Under-Bump-Metallization) materials were specially selected for their solid diffusion <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristics</b> and strong adhesion between bump and MMIC backside metal pad. Bump planarity, shear strength and solderability are extensively characterized, and benchmarked with industry specification...|$|R
50|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have argued that}} DFC may be a simple reflection of analysis, scanner, or physiological noise. Noise in fMRI can arise {{from a variety of}} different factors including heart beat, changes in the blood brain <b>barrier,</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the acquiring scanner, or unintended effects of analysis. Some {{researchers have}} proposed that the variability in functional connectivity in fMRI studies is consistent with the variability that one would expect from simply analyzing random data. This complaint that DFC may reflect only noise has been recently lessened by the observation of electrical basis to fMRI DFC data and behavioral relevance of DFC characteristics.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use of polymeric {{films for}} packaging food is challenging the industry with two very critical facts: aromatic constituents of foodstuffs can either be absorbed by the packaging materials or permeate through the polymers and escape from the package. The packaging and food industries are constantly researching new packaging materials and systems which present alternatives to overcome these problems. In order to evaluate polymers 2 ̆ 7 performance, it is then necessary to develop new testing equipment to prove their barrier efficiency. This study analyzed and compared the <b>characteristics</b> of three <b>barrier</b> materials: BarexR 210, BicorR 84, and BicorR 70 by means of one testing system, which has been recently developed, offering to the industry a useful tool to evaluate the <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the packaging materials. The system uses an isostatic test method and incorporates a flame ionization detector (FID), precise temperature and flow rate control, which allowed to determine the permeability rate, the diffusion rate, and the solubility values of pyridine, and to correlate them with the values obtained from the volatile compounds of fresh ground coffee. The outcome of the experiment proved that all three films tested are very good barrier materials. Nevertheless, {{it is necessary to}} continuing experimenting on the same materials with the same equipment, using different procedures, to find significant figures that could lead to conclusive results about which material has the best <b>barrier</b> <b>characteristics...</b>|$|R

The methodology described in this report {{can be used to}} calculate the EnergyPlus infiltration input for any given building level infiltration rate specified at known pressure difference. The sensitivity analysis shows that EnergyPlus calculates the wind speed based on zone altitude, and the linear wind velocity coefficient represents the variation in infiltration heat loss consistent with building location and weather data...|$|R
