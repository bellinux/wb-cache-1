5|$|In 2011, {{construction}} {{began to}} widen I-94/I-69 approaching the <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge, a project completed in 2012. The widening project added dedicated lanes for local traffic and for <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge traffic {{with a new}} permanent welcome center expected to open in 2015, replacing the temporary one near Capac. The lane configuration changes have confused drivers in the area, especially those with outdated GPS devices, a problem first noted as the department was preparing to reopen the freeway in October 2012. As a result, MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake.|$|E

5|$|US Highway 25A (US25A) was an {{alternate}} route near Port Huron {{that provided a}} connection to the <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge to Canada. The highway split from its parent north of Port Huron and followed 24th Avenue south to connect to M-51 (Pine Grove Avenue) while US25 followed Lakeshore Road and Gratiot Avenue into Port Huron. The parent highway crossed under the approaches to the <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge, and the alternate route, along with M-51, provided a signed path between US25 and the bridge. The designation was created in early 1940 and was deleted when US25 was rerouted in 1963 through Port Huron and over the alternate route.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge links Sarnia and its {{neighbouring}} {{village of}} Point Edward {{to the city}} of Port Huron in the United States. It spans the St. Clair River, which connects Lake Huron to Lake St. Clair. The bridge's original three-lane span, opened in 1938, was twinned on 22 July 1997, making the bridge the fourth busiest border crossing in Ontario. The <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge border crossing makes use of both the NEXUS (frequent traveler program) and the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program. Linking Highway 402 with the American Interstate 94 (I-94) and I-69, the bridge forms part of the NAFTA Superhighway, {{and is one of the}} most important gateways on the north–south truck routes.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of 1962, M-78 was a freeway from Perry at the {{junction}} with M-47 {{all the way to}} Swartz Creek near Flint. On December 12, 1962, I-96 was completed around the Lansing area, and M-78 was rerouted to follow it. A year later, I-496 was partially opened through the Lansing area, and M-78 was routed to follow it as well; the former route through downtown was redesignated Business M-78 (Bus. M-78). Around the same time, I-94 was extended along the <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge approach freeway.|$|E

5|$|I-94/I-69 {{turns back}} to the east about a mile (1.6km) north of their {{confluence}} to span the Black River north of downtown. On the eastern bank of the river, there is one final interchange for M-25 and BL I-69/BL I-94 before the freeway reaches the toll and customs plazas for the twin-span <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge. Past these plazas, I-94/I-69 ascends the approach to the bridge which crosses the St. Clair River to Point Edward (Sarnia), Ontario. At the international boundary {{at the center of the}} river, the Interstate designations jointly terminate, becoming Ontario Highway402.|$|E

The Island far out where wild birds go a-nesting On the lovely <b>blue</b> <b>waters</b> of Castlefore Lake. Then my gaze wandered up in another direction. To some {{beautiful}} swans, oh, what noise they did make. They splashed and they fluttered, but seemed quite contented On the lovely <b>blue</b> <b>waters</b> of Castlefore Lake. A boat being near me, I took the advantage To go for a sail to some different place, I sailed straight across and enjoyed the fresh breezes On the lovely <b>blue</b> <b>waters</b> of Castlefore Lake. On {{the opposite side of the}} lake I just landed. When I woke from my slumber in this far foreign place I felt happy and longed for to dream once again, on The lovely <b>blue</b> <b>waters</b> of Castlefore Lake".|$|R

The aim of this report is to inform the <b>Blue</b> <b>Waters</b> project about MTC, including understanding aspects of MTC applications that can be used to characterize the domain and understanding the implications of these aspects to middleware and policies on <b>Blue</b> <b>Waters.</b> Many MTC applications do not neatly fit the stereotypes of high-performance computing (HPC) or high-throughput computing (HTC) ap-plications. Like HTC applications, by definition MTC applications are structured as graphs of discrete tasks, with explicit input and output de-pendencies forming the graph edges. However, MTC applications have significant features that distinguish them from typical HTC applications...|$|R
5|$|In April 1958, the MSHD {{wanted to}} provide a single number for a more direct routing of a Detroit–Chicago freeway; the state {{proposed}} rerouting I-94 to replace I-92 in the state, but retained the I-77 designation. On June 27, 1958, AASHO adopted their original numbering plan for Michigan, minus the state's proposed changes. Around the same time, a section of M-146 near Port Huron was converted into an approach freeway for the <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge.|$|E
5|$|M-146 {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that initially served as a bypass for traffic going around Port Huron and as a short cut for traffic between U.S. Highway25 (US 25) and M-21. Later it connected to the <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge before it was truncated to its final form. Segments of M-146 still exist today as state highways as part of Interstate94 (I-94) and I-69 and the Lapeer Connector.|$|E
5|$|On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was {{approved}} by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), and the original route of US12 replaced the highways from the state line northeasterly to Detroit; US31 overlapped the highway between St. Joseph and Watervliet. The remainder of the future I-94 corridor was served by US25 between Detroit and Port Huron. The first span of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge opened between Port Huron and Point Edward, Ontario, in 1938.|$|E

5|$|The eastern {{terminus}} of I-94 in the Port Huron {{area was}} dedicated on October 14, 1964, signaling {{the completion of}} the highway between Marysville and the <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge. Two years later, the gap between the Wayne–Macomb county line {{and the end of the}} freeway near Mount Clemens was filled in when another section of freeway opened. North of Albion, the route of the freeway previously crossed a branch of the New York Central Railroad at-grade; the crossing was eliminated when the tracks were removed in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Business Loop I-69 (BL I-69) is a {{business}} loop running through downtown Port Huron. The first mile or so (1.7km) of BL I-69 runs southeasterly from I-69 at the interchange where it meets I-94. The business loop follows a four-lane freeway until the intersection with 32nd Street. A bit further east, it turns due east–west into a one-way pair of three-lane surface streets, eastbound along Oak Street and westbound along Griswold Street, that run through residential areas on the west and south sides of Port Huron. East of 23rd Street. {{the two halves of}} BL I-69 narrow to two lanes each. In downtown Port Huron, BL I-69 turns northerly running concurrently with BL I-94 on four-lane Military Avenue parallel to the St. Clair River. North of the crossing of the Black River, BL I-69/BL I-94 continues northward on Huron Avenue through downtown. At the intersection with Glenwood Avenue, the business loop turns northwesterly onto Pine Grove Avenue through residential areas {{on the north side of}} the city. The street is five lanes, two in each direction with a center turn lane, and passes under the I-94/I-69 freeway at the toll and customs plazas for the <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge; north of the freeway, there is a ramp to connect to the eastbound direction of the freeway and the bridge. The business loop continues along Pine Grove Avenue, intersecting the southern end of M-25 at Hancock Street. At that intersection, the business loop turns westward for a block. It then turns south along the connector to terminate at westbound I-94/I-69 west of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge toll plaza.|$|E
5|$|During the 1600s and 1700s, The Three Fires Confederacy {{controlled}} much of {{the area}} known as {{the hub of the}} Great Lakes, which included the Canadian shore where Sarnia is now located. During this time, it maintained relations with many of the First Nations, including Huron, Sioux, and Iroquois, as well as the countries of Great Britain and France. Their trading partners, the Huron, welcomed La Salle and the Griffon in 1679 after he sailed into Lake Huron. The Ontario Heritage Trust erected a historical plaque under the <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge in commemoration of the voyage, as shown in the photo.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, US25 {{was changed}} to traffic along a one-way pairing of streets on the {{southwest}} side of Port Huron. Northbound traffic remained on Military Avenue while southbound traffic was diverted to Electric Avenue. Two US25A routings were created in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The first, near Erie, was numbered in 1937, and renumbered US24A by 1945. The second in Port Huron provided access to the <b>Blue</b> <b>Water</b> Bridge from the mainline of the highway starting in 1940.
