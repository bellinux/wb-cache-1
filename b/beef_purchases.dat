40|$|Great {{taste is}} the primary reason {{consumers}} frequently make beef their food of choice for a pleasurable dining experience. Research conducted to examine consumers ’ preferences for various protein sources (beef, chicken, fish, pork, shellfish) has shown that a pleasurable eating experience is the number-one driver of protein preference, whether dining {{at home or in}} a restaurant (NCBA, 2006). In a 2006 investigation of factors influencing <b>beef</b> <b>purchases</b> (Reicks, 2006), consumers were asked to rate the importance of nine different product attributes (tenderness, juiciness, flavor, product consistency, ease of preparation, nutritional value, natural, organic, and price) when making beef purchase decisions. In that study, the most important “purchasing motivators ” were (1) taste attributes, (2) price, and (3) product consistency (Reicks, 2006). Similarly, Moeller and Courington (1997) found that consumers rated attributes related to the eating experience (i. e., flavor, tenderness, meal enjoyment, and consistent quality) as most important when purchasing beef. Delivering a desirable eating experience time-after-time is fundamentally important to sustained growth in beef demand (Schroeder and Mark, 2000).

Three measures of beef purchased were used to understand consumers‟ reaction under food risk. A random effects Logit model was applied to test whether any beef was purchased during a given month. Consumption in terms of unit purchases was measured with a random effects Negative Binomial model and consumption in terms of beef expenditure was measured with a standard random effects model. In this study, household heterogeneity in actual meat purchases was partially explained using data from a self-reported food opinions survey. Of special interest was the hypothesis that consumers responded consistently to BSE in a one-time survey and in actual meat purchase behavior spanning years. Regional differences appeared in the study, with consumers in eastern Canada reacting most negatively to BSE.

Engel Curve analysis focusing on the dynamics of the monthly meat expenditure shares for a selected sample of 437 Canadian households for 2002 through 2005 is applied based on data on household expenditures for meat purchased by a national sample of Canadian households from the Nielsen Homescan® Canadian panel, supplemented by survey responses on BSE risk perceptions and measures of trust. Two sets of models are estimated: Engel curves in differences with instruments in levels and Engel curves in levels with instruments in differences. It is found that habit persistence limited households’ reductions of <b>beef</b> <b>purchases</b> following the first BSE event and that that trust limited households’ reduction in beef expenditure shares following the subsequent two BSE cases.

The relatively high price of beef (34 %) and consumers' unfamiliarity with its cooking method (26 %) are the main limitations for beef consumption when compared with other meats, followed by 'don't like the taste and smell' which shows that compared with pork, beef is still relatively new to Chinese consumers {{and some of them are}} not used to the flavour of beef products. The characteristics of target consumers who show a preference towards beef are: residents of urban areas, a small family or a family with more than average males over 16 years old, the young (below 45 years old) and well educated, possessing a good income and considering safety, price and ease of preparation as important purchasing criteria...|$|R

Central questions are: How can more farmers become more effective learners? How can their uptake of training, assumed to be a pathway to QA accreditation, be multiplied? Through the project’s crucial mid-point meeting and subsequent analysis of multiple data sources, evidence is presented which sheds light on the nature and role of “self-confidence ” in the learning process.

40|$|Consumers reveal {{preferences}} for fresh beef attributes through their retail <b>beef</b> <b>purchases.</b> Hedonic pricing methods {{were used to}} estimate the value consumers place on observable characteristics of fresh beef products, especially on retail beef brands. Primary {{data were collected from}} 65 randomly generated grocery stores located in three metropolitan areas, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Denver, Colorado. Retail beef package data were collected on 462 ground products, 175 roast products, and 756 steak products. There was some evidence retail beef brands command a price premium compared with unbranded, generic products. In this study, branding programs classified as “special” (i. e. no antibiotics, no hormones, all natural) offered the largest price premiums, but “other” types of branding programs offered price premiums as well. Price premiums for special brands were $ 1. 45 /lb. for ground products and $ 5. 87 /lb. for steak products. Labeling variables were not consistently significant in this study, indicating that labels associated with a brand name might offer consumers the most reassurance for their purchasing decision. The most important attributes affecting retail price per pound of ground beef products are store location (metropolitan area), store type, type of product, fat content, package size and type, expiration dates, brands and labels. Store location (metropolitan area) was important but store type was less important for explaining steak items than ground items. Steak prices were influenced by cut type, USDA quality grade, package size and type, and slightly by expiration date. Beef, Hedonic pricing, Marketing, Retail beef brands, Retail prices,...|$|E

40|$|This study relates habit {{persistence}} and trust to recurring food safety {{incidents in the}} context of a series of three BSE incidents in Canada. We examined the dynamics of monthly beef expenditure shares of a sample of Canadian households for monthly time periods during year 2002 through 2005 using micro level panel data which followed meat expenditures by Canadian households before and after the first three BSE cases which were discovered in 2003 and 2005. Our results suggest that households’ reactions to the first three BSE events followed a similar general pattern: households reduced beef purchase expenditures following the discovery of BSE but these expenditures subsequently recovered, suggesting that concern diminished over time. Following the first BSE event, we identified an immediate negative impact on beef expenditures. However, in the case of the second and third BSE events, this negative impact was not evident until two months after these BSE announcements. In each of the three cases, the negative impact of BSE on beef purchase expenditures was limited to no more than four months. Assessment of how habit persistence affected beef expenditures indicates that this influence limited households reductions of <b>beef</b> <b>purchases</b> following the BSE events, but the effects of habit diminished subsequent to the initial event. Regarding the role of trust in shaping households’ reactions to BSE, we found that households’ respondents whose answers to standardized questions suggest that they are not “trusting” individuals were more sensitive to the food risks identified by the BSE events.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsTed SchroederThis {{dissertation}} empirically {{examines how}} demand-enhancing activities conducted by food industry participants affect retail beef steak pricing, consumer demand for ground beef, and industry concentration. It follows the journal article style and includes three self-contained chapters. Chapter 1 uses a two step hedonic model with retail scanner data of consumer beef steak purchases {{to determine if}} there are incentives to identify certain attributes and to determine what types of attributes entertain price premiums and at what levels these premiums exists. Results indicate that most branded beef steak products garnered premiums along with organic claim, religious processing claim, and premium steak cuts. Factors influencing brand equity are new brands targeting emerging consumer trends, brands with regional prominence, and those positioned as special-labels, program/breed specific, and store brands. Chapter 2 reports tests of aggregation over elementary ground beef products and estimates composite demand elasticities. Results suggest consumers differentiate ground beef according to lean percentage (70 - 77 %, 78 - 84 %, 85 - 89 %, 90 - 95 %, and 96 - 100 %) and brand type (local/regional, national, store, and unbranded). The range in composite elasticity estimates shows the value of analyzing demand elasticity based on differentiation and not simply considering ground beef as being homogeneous. Composite elasticity estimates provide improved understanding of how consumers make decisions concerning ground <b>beef</b> <b>purchases.</b> Chapter 3 examines industry concentration for the U.
