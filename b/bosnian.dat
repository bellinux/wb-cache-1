In the final days of March, the <b>Bosnian</b> Serb army started artillery attacks on Bosanski Brod, and the HV 108th Brigade crossed the border adjacent to the town in reply. On 4 April, Serb artillery began shelling Sarajevo. Even though the war originally pitted <b>Bosnian</b> Serbs against non-Serbs in the country, it evolved into a three-sided conflict {{by the end of the}} year, as the Croat–Bosniak War started. By that time, the <b>Bosnian</b> Serb army—renamed Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) after the Republika Srpska state proclaimed in the <b>Bosnian</b> Serb-held territory—controlled about 70% of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That proportion would not change significantly over the next two years. Republika Srpska was involved in the Croatian War of Independence in a limited capacity, through military and other aid to the RSK, occasional air raids launched from Banja Luka, and most significantly through artillery attacks against urban centres.|$|E

This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This declaration was later cited by the <b>Bosnian</b> Serbs as a pretext for the <b>Bosnian</b> War. <b>Bosnian</b> Serbs began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. On 27 March, <b>Bosnian</b> Serb forces bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, drawing a border crossing by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) 108th Brigade in response.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds {{of members}} of the <b>Bosnian</b> Muslim SS {{divisions}} volunteered to fight in the 1948–1949 Arab–Israeli War. Many were recruited by agents of al-Husayni, who achieved political leadership of the Palestinian Arabs following the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. The Syrian government also made a request for the transfer of 8,000 <b>Bosnian</b> Muslim refugees to Syria, many for recruitment into the Syrian Armed Forces. Iraq sent representatives to Europe and invited 2,500 <b>Bosnian</b> Muslims to settle in their nation. Frantzman and Culibrk estimate that approximately 1,000 former <b>Bosnian</b> Muslim SS members fought in Palestine, but say it is possible that <b>Bosnian</b> Muslim participation was much more extensive. Contemporary Haganah intelligence records suggest that up to 4,000 <b>Bosnian</b> Muslim volunteers took part. Many of the volunteers served in the Arab Liberation Army's Ajnaddin Battalion, as well as the Army of the Holy War.|$|E
5|$|In September 1991, <b>Bosnian</b> Serbs proclaimed a Serbian Autonomous Oblast with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the <b>Bosnian</b> {{referendum}} on independence was passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and <b>Bosnian</b> Croats, although <b>Bosnian</b> Serbs either boycotted it or were prevented from voting by <b>Bosnian</b> Serb authorities. A poorly organized, local Bosniak Patriotic League paramilitary group {{had been established}} {{in response to the}} <b>Bosnian</b> Serb proclamation. On 31 March, the Patriotic League in Bijeljina was provoked into fighting by local Serbs and the SDG. On 1–2 April, the SDG and the JNA took over Bijeljina with little resistance; murders, rapes, house searches, and pillaging followed. These actions were described as genocidal by the historian Professor Eric D. Weitz of the City College of New York. Professor Michael Sells of the University of Chicago concluded that they were carried out to erase the cultural history of the Bosniak people of Bijeljina.|$|E
5|$|On 5 March, the <b>Bosnian</b> Serb TO {{requested}} {{equipment for}} two companies mobilised in villages around Kupres—Malovan, Rilić and Ravno. The mobilisation {{was motivated by}} poor military intelligence provided by the 30th Partisan Division. It indicated the presence of thousands of HV and <b>Bosnian</b> Croat troops {{in the vicinity of}} Kupres, supported by Leopard 1 tanks drawn from a contingent of approximately 100 Leopards that the JNA believed had been delivered to Croatia. In response, the division was tasked to deploy its elements to Kupres, Ključ, Mrkonjić Grad, Šipovo, Jajce and the Mount Vlašić, take command of the <b>Bosnian</b> Serb TO and repel the expected Croatian attack. In order to achieve this, the division mobilised the 1st, 13th and 19th Partisan Brigades—assigning Kupres to the 19th Brigade as its AOR. By 23 March, the brigade received mobilised troops sufficient to set up three companies. Their immediate task was to block the Malovan and Kupreška Vrata mountain passes. The next day, the divisional commander toured the plateau and was informed that the <b>Bosnian</b> Croat forces were in control of the villages of Olovo, Osmanlije and Zlosela, in addition to Kupreška Vrata. On 26 March, the <b>Bosnian</b> Serb TO battalion based in Malovan was subordinated to the 19th Partisan Brigade. At this time, both sides had a relatively small portion of their force inside Kupres, while the <b>Bosnian</b> Croat TO held the area adjacently surrounding the town. The <b>Bosnian</b> Serb TO and the JNA completely controlled the areas surrounding the <b>Bosnian</b> Croat TO force.|$|E

5|$|On 9 January 1992, a <b>Bosnian</b> Serb {{state was}} declared, {{ahead of the}} 29 February1 March {{referendum}} on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovinalater cited as a pretext for the <b>Bosnian</b> War). The <b>Bosnian</b> Serb state was later renamed Republika Srpska. As the JNA withdrew from Croatia it started to transform into a <b>Bosnian</b> Serb army, handing over its weapons, equipment and 55,000 troops. The process was completed in May, when the <b>Bosnian</b> Serb army became the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS). It was faced by the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), established in April, and the Bosnia and Herzegovina TOrenamed the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine – ARBiH) in May. Formal establishment of these forces was preceded by the first armed clashes in the country as the <b>Bosnian</b> Serbs set up barricades in Sarajevo and elsewhere on 1March and the situation rapidly escalated. <b>Bosnian</b> Serb artillery began shelling Bosanski Brod {{by the end of}} March, and Sarajevo was first shelled on 4April. By the end of 1992, the VRS held 70% of Bosnia and Herzegovina, following a large-scale campaign of conquest and ethnic cleansing backed by military and financial support from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The <b>Bosnian</b> War gradually evolved into a three-sided conflict. The initial ARBiH–HVO alliance soon deteriorated as the forces became rivals for control of parts of the country. Ethnic tensions escalated from apparently insignificant harassment in July, to an open Croat–Bosniak War by October 1992. The <b>Bosnian</b> Croat authorities, organized in the Herzeg-Bosnia territory, were intent on attaching the region to Croatia. This was incompatible with Bosniak aspirations for a unitary state.|$|E
