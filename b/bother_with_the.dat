5|$|The {{briefing}} {{process was}} repeated {{with a second}} group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six {{were found to be}} over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six. Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Clinic and the Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory. Only one candidate, Jim Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error; thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA Space Task Group, Robert R. Gilruth, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.|$|E
25|$|Persons {{who keep}} their own surname after {{marriage}} {{do so for}} a number of reasons. Objection to the inequality of the tradition is one major reason. Some people are the last ones in the family with that surname. Others don't want to <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> paperwork. Common reasons for maintaining their birth name include not wanting to lose their identity, preferring their last name to their spouse's last name, and fear of professional ramifications.|$|E
25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, {{or may be}} left in the as-cast state. (The same can be said of cast gear teeth.) Whether or not to <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> additional expense of a machining operation depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With sand casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on cable glands (connectors/fittings).|$|E

25|$|Though cell {{reproduction}} {{that uses}} mitosis can reproduce eukaryotic cells, eukaryotes <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> more complicated process of meiosis because sexual reproduction such as meiosis confers a selective advantage. Notice that when meiosis starts, the {{two copies of}} sister chromatids number 2 are adjacent to each other. During this time, there can be genetic recombination events. Parts of the chromosome 2 DNA gained from one parent (red) will swap over to the chromosome 2 DNA molecule that received from the other parent (green). Notice that in mitosis the two copies of chromosome number 2 do not interact. It is these new combinations of parts of chromosomes that provide the major advantage for sexually reproducing organisms by allowing for new combinations of genes and more efficient evolution.|$|E
500|$|The use of Viking {{themes and}} imagery in hard rock and heavy metal music predates {{the advent of}} Viking metal. For instance, the lyrics to Led Zeppelin's [...] "Immigrant Song" [...] (1970) and [...] "No Quarter" [...] (1973) feature allusions to Viking voyages, violence, and exploration. The Swedish band Heavy Load often wrote Viking-themed songs, such as the 1978 song [...] "Son of the Northern Light", and Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic claims that the 1983 song [...] "Stronger than Evil" [...] {{establishes}} a case for Heavy Load as the first Viking metal group. Swedish neoclassical metal guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen sometimes featured themes of hyper-masculinity, heroic warriors, and Vikings; for example, on his 1985 album Marching Out. The German band Grave Digger and American band Manowar, both of which formed in 1980, drew upon Norse myth as envisioned in Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Faithful Breath – which wore fur and horned helmet costumes – and TNT also experimented with Viking themes. Manowar adopted Viking imagery much more heavily than other bands, and {{became known as the}} [...] "champions of the furry loincloth"; they met with ridicule even within the metal community, but attracted a cult following. Unlike the later Viking metal bands, Manowar did not <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> historicity of popular Viking image, and did not in any way identify with the Vikings, religiously or racially. Trafford and Pluskowski explain that [...] "the Manowar version of the Vikings owes as much to Conan the Barbarian as it does to history, saga, or Edda: What matters to Manowar is untamed masculinity, and the Vikings are for them merely the archetypal barbarian males." ...|$|E
