40|$|A major global {{effort is}} {{currently}} underway to reduce dependence on petroleum products and minimize {{the impact of}} their derivatives on the environment. Plant oils are being investigated as a potential source of environmentally favorable lubricants given their combination of biodegradability, renewability and excellent lubrication performance. Low oxidation and thermal stability, poor low-temperature properties and a narrow range of available viscosities, however, limit their potential application as industrial biolubricants. The chemical modification of plant fatty acid structures has great potential for improving the physicochemical and friction-reducing properties of these compounds. This paper presents the thermo-oxidation, friction-reducing and physicochemical properties of a series of diester compounds derived from ricinoleic acid as biolubricant <b>basestocks.</b> The results indicated that among the synthesized ricinoleic acid-based diester compounds, octyl 10, 12 -dihydroxy- 9 -behenoxystearate 16 has the lowest pour point (− 53. 26  °C), while octyl 10, 12 -dihydroxy- 9 -octyloxystearate 10 has the highest onset temperature (128. 98  °C) and the lowest volatile loss and quantity of insoluble deposits (68. 78 % and 77. 25 %, respectively). The friction-reducing results indicate an improvement occurred in the presence of longer mid-chain esters and an increased polarity in the ester functional group.

Calcium sulfonates additives are also added to protect motor oil from oxidative breakdown {{and to prevent}} the formation of sludge and varnish deposits. Both were the main basis of additive packages used by lubricant manufacturers up until the 1990s when the need for ashless additives arose. Main advantage was very low price and wide availability (sulfonates were originally waste byproducts). Currently there are ashless oil lubricants without these additives, which can only fulfill the qualities of the previous generation with more expensive <b>basestock</b> and more expensive organic or organometallic additive compounds.

50|$|Improvement in {{filtration}} {{technologies and}} processes has now made recycling {{a viable option}} (with rising price of base stock and crude oil). Typically various filtration systems remove particulates, additives and oxidation products and recover the base oil. The oil may get refined during the process. This base oil is then treated {{much the same as}} virgin base oil however there is considerable reluctance to use recycled oils as they are generally considered inferior. <b>Basestock</b> fractionally vacuum distilled from used lubricants has superior properties to all natural oils, but cost effectiveness depends on many factors. Used lubricant may also be used as refinery feedstock to become part of crude oil. Again, there is considerable reluctance to this use as the additives, soot and wear metals will seriously poison/deactivate the critical catalysts in the process. Cost prohibits carrying out both filtration (soot, additives removal) and re-refining (distilling, isomerisation, hydrocrack, etc.) however the primary hindrance to recycling still remains the collection of fluids as refineries need continuous supply in amounts measured in cisterns, rail tanks.|$|E

30|$|The oleochemical esters are {{a growing}} {{interest}} {{with respect to}} the base lubricants industry. Their advantages compared to mineral base oil include low toxicity, higher biodegradability, renewability, high flash point, low volatility, high additive solvency power, high added value, good lubricity (due to molecule polarity), high viscosity index due to the double bonds and molecular linearity. However, the main disadvantages of these organic compounds are oxidative instability, hydrolytic instability, low temperature properties. These disadvantages can be minimized by additives, but the biodegradability, toxicity and the price can be endangered. Thus, the chemical synthesis of these compounds seems to be a veritable choice towards eco-friendly <b>basestocks.</b> The additives that could be used include anti-oxidant, anti-wear, anti-corrosion, etc., which are associated with low biodegradability. However, the additives industry is working hard to develop biodegradable additives [2].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to set <b>basestock</b> levels in a multiproduct system with setups and random yield. The system is {{represented}} by a polling model and the inventory level of each product is controlled using a <b>basestock</b> policy.

If the capacity of the queue is equal to the inventory allocated to the item, then when the queue is full, inventory is fully depleted and new demand is either backlogged, lost or expedited. Defects are routed to temporary storage queues associated with each item, and then routed back to the original queue for service during the next cycle. For a system with backlogging, we provide a cost function that is minimized by solving N single item newsvendor problems. For a system with lost sales or expediting, we introduce a cost function and provide a heuristic for finding the <b>basestock</b> levels.

40|$|We {{consider}} a joint inventory-pricing problem in which buyers act strategically and bid for units of a firm’s product over an infinite horizon. The number of bidders in each period {{as well as}} the individual bidders ’ valuations are random but stationary over time. There is a holding cost for inventory and a unit cost for ordering more stock from an outside supplier. Backordering is not allowed. The firm must decide how to conduct its auctions and how to replenish its stock over time to maximize its profits. We show that the optimal auction and replenishment policy for this problem is quite simple, consisting of running a standard first-price or second-price auction with a fixed reserve price in each period and following an order-up-to (<b>basestock)</b> policy for replenishing inventory {{at the end of each}} period. Moreover, the optimal <b>basestock</b> level can be easily computed. We then compare this optimal <b>basestock,</b> reserve-price-auction policy to a traditional <b>basestock,</b> list-price policy. We prove that in the limiting case of one buyer per period and in the limiting case of a large number of buyers per period and linear holding cost, list pricing is optimal. List pricing also becomes optimal as the holding cost tends to zero. Numerical comparisons confirm these theoretical results and show that auctions provide significant benefits when: (1) the number of buyers is moderate, (2) holding costs are high, or (3) there is high variability in the number of buyers per period.

We first investigate an inventory {{system in which}} the probability distributions of order leadtimes are dependent on the state of an exogenous Markov process; we will model border disruptions via this exogenous process. We consider stationary, state-dependent <b>basestock</b> policies, which are known to be optimal for the system under study, and develop an expression for the long-run average cost of an arbitrary policy of this form. Restricting our attention to state-invariant <b>basestock</b> policies, we show how to calculate the optimal <b>basestock</b> (or order-up-to) level and long-run average cost. We provide a sufficient condition for the optimality of a state-invariant <b>basestock</b> policy and monotonicity results for the optimal state-invariant order-up-to level. We finally give the optimal state-invariant order-up-to level for a special class of supply states. Motivated by the possibility of port of entry closures {{in the event of a}} security incident, we specialize the previous model to a two-stage international supply chain. A domestic manufacturer orders a single product from a foreign supplier and the orders must cross an international border that is subject to closure. We first assume that border congestion is negligible. The manufacturer's optimal inventory policy and long-run average cost are analyzed. We present structural policy results and the results of a comprehensive numerical study that have important implications for business and for the cooperation between business and government in disruption management and contingency planning. Finally we extend the border closure model to include both border closures and the resulting congestion. We model the border processing system as a discrete-time, single-server queue with constant arrival rate and Markov-modulated service rate. A key task is the development of the leadtime distribution, which is more complex than in the previous model.

40|$|AbstractFor {{environmental}} reasons, {{as well as}} {{the dwindling}} source of petroleum, a new class of environmentally acceptable and renewable biolubricants based on plant oils is available. Even though plant oils possess excellent lubricant-related properties, there are some concerns about using it as biolubricant base oil. In this study we present a series of structures derived from oleic acid to be used as synthetic biolubricant <b>basestocks.</b> Measuring of pour point (PP), flash point, viscosity index (VI), oxidation onset temperature (OT) and signal maximum temperature (SMT) was carried out for each compound. Furthermore, the friction and wear properties were measured using a high-frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR). The resulting product structures were confirmed by NMR and FTIR spectroscopic analysis. The results showed that ethylhexyl 9 -(octanoyloxy) - 10 -(behenoxy) octadecanoate with behenyl mid-chain ester exhibited the most favorable low temperature performance (PP − 48 °C) and ethylhexyl 9 -(octanoyloxy) - 10 -(octyloxy) octadecanoate octyl mid-chain ester exhibited higher oxidation stability (OT 142 °C) than the other synthetic ester oils. On the other hand, the highest ball wear scan diameter was obtained for ethylhexyl 9 -(octanoyloxy) - 10 -(behenoxy) octadecanoate while the lowest value was obtained for 9 -hydroxy- 10 -octyloxyoctadecanoic acid.

40|$|Traditionally {{rolling contact}} fatigue {{observed}} in bearing field applications was subsurface initiated. However, despite {{an improvement in}} the properties of steel, some factors such as downsizing in bearing design, extreme loading of bearings as well as demanding application conditions (start-stop cycles) have led {{to an increase in}} cases of surface damage related to surface initiated fatigue, which essentially comes from surface distress. Possible causes leading to surface initiated fatigue are: material and surface properties, marginal lubrication and lubricant chemical composition. Lubricants are formulated products composed of a base oil and an additive package designed for a specific application. Extreme-pressure (EP) and antiwear (AW) additives are chemically active, they react with the steel surfaces in contact to form a protective additive-derived layer, thus reducing friction and controlling wear. However, certain EP/AW additives that increase the performance of other machine elements, such as gears, can be detrimental for bearings running in the same lubrication environment. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} gain a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of interaction of the lubricant additives affecting bearing performance and to predict the bearing performance in terms of lubrication environment and application conditions. Antiwear and extreme pressure additives form a protective layer on the surface of the contacting steel surfaces. Therefore, in order to identify the plausible mechanisms that govern the detrimental effect of additives on bearing performance, it is necessary to identify the parameters affecting the additive-derived layer formation and the tribological properties of this layer, as they are directly related to the additive reactivity towards the surface. To identify these parameters this thesis has been divided into three areas of study; the lubricant composition, the operation conditions relevant for bearing applications, and the properties of the contacting surfaces. The work on the effect of lubricant composition on additive-derived reaction layer formation, especially when related to ZDDP chemistry, has mainly been focused on the different formulations of the additive and the inherent properties due to the different chemical structures, concentrations and interaction with other additives present in the lubricant. The role of the base oil has not been sufficiently addressed, however the relevance of synthetic base oils has brought a new focus on the effect of the interactions between the base oil and additive molecules on tribological performance. The polarity of the base oil was selected as the key parameter to study. Several operating conditions (in terms of lambda ratio, temperature and additive concentration) have been previously studied. It has been shown that low lambda ratio, meaning high metal to metal contact, high temperature and high additive concentration lead to a high reactivity of the additives and therefore to thicker reaction layers. However, the majority of these studies have been performed under pure sliding conditions or at high slide-roll ratios (SRR > 50 %), corresponding to typical operating conditions for gears. The behaviour of the additives when the slide-roll ratio ranges from between 0 to 10 %, conditions that can be found in bearing applications, has hardly been addressed. Finally, the influence of the surface on the activation and reactivity of the additive was studied using different counterparts (steel and stainless steel), all present in bearing applications. The nature and properties of the derived reaction layers, as a function of base oil-additive interaction, operating conditions and contacting materials, in terms of thickness, morphology, nanomechanical properties and chemical composition, were studied using a series of surface analysis techniques. Zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) and low viscosity model oils as well as commercial <b>basestocks,</b> with similar physical properties but different polarities were selected for this study. The influence of base oil polarity, operating conditions and contacting surfaces on the additive performance was studied at the nanoscale level using Atomic Force Microscopy and the tribological performance was evaluated using a ball-on-disc test rig under mixed rolling-sliding conditions in the boundary lubrication regime. An in-situ interferometry technique was used to monitor the additive-derived reaction layer formation, and the chemical composition, morphology and nanomechanical properties were studied using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy and Nanoindentation respectively. The polarity of the base oil influences the tribological performance of ZDDP additives in rolling-sliding lubricated contacts. The same additive presents differences in friction and wear performance as a function of the type of oil it is blended in. The polarity of the oil influences the growth rate and reaction layer thickness of ZDDP antiwear layers. The polarity of the molecules determines the way they approach and attach to the surface, influencing the final reaction layer thickness, as well as the structure and characteristics of the reaction layer. A thinner layer is formed when the additive is blended in the polar oil, due to the higher affinity of the polar base oil molecules for the steel surface, that limit the access of the additive molecules to the surface and therefore their ability to attach and react with it to form a protective reaction layer. The morphology of the reaction layers derived from polar base oils solutions consist of large, smooth pads, identified as features with load carrying capacity. The formation of this type of structure, and the nanomechanical properties of the layer, explain the better wear performance exhibited by those layers. A model for the formation of the reaction layer, consisting of three stages: activation, wearing-out and equilibrium, is proposed. Regarding the operating conditions, shear was identified as a fundamental parameter for the activation of additives on rubbing steel surfaces and the properties of the derived reaction layer. The influence of different metallic materials was studied using different steel/stainless steel pairs. The results show how different metallic materials lead to the formation of layer, similar in thickness but with very different topographies. The presence of extensive cracks on the layers formed on the stainless steel surface indicates that the nature of the oxides present on the surface influence the adhesion properties of the reaction layer.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to solve}} the periodic-reviewed {{inventory}} control problem in supply chain networks with uncertain demand so as to minimize the overall cost of the system over a fixed planning time horizon. In such problems, one seeks to optimally determine ordering quantities at different stages in time.

We use sum-of-square relaxations to reformulate the problem into a single semidefinite optimization problem for a specific polynomial degree. We consider both robust and stochastic approaches {{in order to address}} the uncertainties in demand. In extensive numerical studies, we find that polynomial policies exhibit better performance over <b>basestock</b> policies across a variety of networks and demand distributions under the mean and standard deviation criteria. However, when the uncertainty set turns out to be larger than planned, <b>basestock</b> policies start outperforming polynomial policies. Comparing the policies obtained under the robust and stochastic frameworks, we find that they are comparable in the average performance criterion, but the robust approach leads to better tail behavior and lower standard deviation in general. by Liwei He.

40|$|The {{production}} line of modern multi-product manufacturing with erratic demand profiles {{shows that the}} selection and implementation of appropriate production control strategy are an important challenge. Organisations that adopt pull-type production control strategies, such as Kanban control strategy, for multi-product {{production line}}s find {{that is necessary to}} plan high Kanban card allocations in order to maintain volume flexibility to manage demand variability. This can result in line congestion, long lead times and low throughput rate. A recently proposed shared Kanban allocation policy has the benefit of minimising inventories in the line by allocating Kanbans accordingly and therefore maintains volume flexibility. However, many pull production control strategies that {{have been shown to be}} successful in single product manufacturing environments, for instance Kanban, CONWIP and <b>Basestock</b> cannot operate the shared Kanban allocation policy naturally. This Thesis presents a practically applicable modification approach to enable pull production control strategies that are naturally unable to operate in a shared Kanban allocation policy mode to operate it. Furthermore, the approach enables the development of a new pull production control strategy referred to as <b>Basestock</b> Kanban CONWIP control strategy that has the capability to operate the shared Kanban allocation policy, minimising inventory and backlog while maintaining volume flexibility. To investigate the performance of the pull production control strategies and policies, discrete event simulation and evolutionary multi-objective optimisation approach were adopted to develop sets of non-dominated optimal solutions for the experiments. Nelson’s screening and selection procedure were used to select the best pull control strategy and Kanban allocation policy when robustness are not considered. Additionally, Latin hypercube sampling technique and stochastic dominance test were employed for selection of a superior policy and strategy under environmental and system variability. Under non-robust conditions (anticipated environmental and system variability), pull control strategies combined with the shared Kanban allocation policy outperforms pull control strategies combined with dedicated Kanban allocation policy. Conversely, pull control strategies combined with the dedicated Kanban allocation policy outperforms pull control strategies combined with shared Kanban allocation policy when the system is prone to environmental and system variabilities. Furthermore <b>Basestock</b> Kanban CONWIP control strategy outperforms the alternatives in both robust and non-robust conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|In practice, {{inventory}} {{managers are}} often {{confronted with a}} need to consider one or more aggregate constraints. These aggregate constraints result from available workspace, workforce, maximum investment or target service level. We consider independent multi-item inventory problems with aggregate constraints {{and one of the}} following characteristics: deterministic leadtime demand, newsvendor, <b>basestock</b> policy, rQ policy and sS policy. We analyze some recent relevant references and investigate the considered versions of the problem, the proposed model formulations and the algorithmic approaches. Finally we highlight the limitations from a practical viewpoint for these models and point out some possible direction for future improvements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVariability, in general, has a deteriorating {{effect on}} the {{performance}} of stochastic inventory systems. In particular, previous results indicate that demand variability causes a performance degradation in terms of inventory related costs when production capacity is unlimited. In order to investigate the effects of demand variability in capacitated production settings, we analyze a make-to-stock queue with general demand arrival times operated according to a <b>basestock</b> policy. We show that when demand inter-arrival distributions are ordered in a stochastic sense, increased arrival time variability indeed leads to an augmentation of optimal base-stock levels and to a corresponding increase in optimal inventory related costs. We quantify these effects through several numerical example...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the so called}} warehouse problem with both space and injection/withdrawal capacity limits. This is a foundational problem in the merchant management of assets for the storage of commodities, such as energy sources and natural resources. When the commodity spot price evolves according to an exogenous Markov process, this work shows that the optimal inventory trading policy of a risk neutral merchant is characterized by two stage and spot price dependent <b>basestock</b> targets. Under some assumptions, these targets are monotone in the spot price and partition the available inventory and spot price space in each stage into three regions, where it is respectively optimal to buy and inject, do nothing, and withdraw and sell. In some cases of practical importance, one can easily compute the optimal <b>basestock</b> targets. The structure of the optimal policy is nontrivial because in each stage the merchant’s qualification of high (selling) and low (buying) commodity prices in general depends on the merchant’s inventory availability. This {{is a consequence of}} the interplay between the capacity and space limits of the storage asset and brings to light the nontrivial nature of the interface between trading and operations. A computational analysis based on natural gas data shows that mismanaging this interface can yield significant value losses. Moreover, adapting the merchant’s optimal trading policy to the spot price stochastic evolution has substantial value. This value can be almost entirely generated by reacting to the unfolding of price uncertainty; that is, by sequentially reoptimizing a model that ignores this source of uncertainty...|$|E
