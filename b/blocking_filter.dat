UV filters are {{sometimes referred to}} as L37 or L39 filters, depending on the wavelengths of light that they filter out; an L37 filter removes ultraviolet light with a wavelength shorter than 370 nm, whereas an L39 filter eliminates light with a wavelength shorter than 390 nm.|$|E

50|$|Modified {{digital cameras}} can detect some ultraviolet, {{all of the}} visible {{and much of the}} near {{infrared}} spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about 350 nm to 1000 nm.

Replacing a hot mirror or infrared <b>blocking</b> <b>filter</b> with an infrared pass or a wide spectrally transmitting filter allows the camera to detect the wider spectrum light at greater sensitivity. Without the hot-mirror, the red, green and blue (or cyan, yellow and magenta) elements of the color filter array placed over the sensor elements pass varying amounts of ultraviolet and infrared which may be recorded in any of the red, green or blue channels depending on the particular sensor in use and on the dyes used in the Bayer filter.
