5000|$|Three-dimensionality in {{turbomachine}} increases {{complexity in}} flow field so, determination of losses becomes difficult unlike two-dimensional losses where equation complexity is little. Three-dimensionality includes large pressure gradients in every direction, design/curvature of blade, shock wave, heat transfer, cavitation and viscous effects, which generates secondary flow, vortices, tip leakage vortices and other losses. Viscous effects in turbomachinery causes blockage to the flow by formation of viscous layers around blade profile which effect pressure rise/fall and reduce effective area of flow field. Interaction between these losses in rotor increase instability and decreases in efficiency of turbomachinery. In calculation of three-dimensional losses every parameter comes into picture of flow path like axial spacing between vane and blade rows, end wall curvature, radial distribution of pressure gradient, hup/tip ratio, dihedral, lean, tip clearance, flare, aspect ratio, skew, sweep, platform cooling holes, surface roughness, off take bleeds. Associated with blade profile like camber distribution, stagger angle, <b>blade</b> <b>spacing,</b> blade camber, chord, surface roughness, leading and trailing edge radii, maximum thickness. So, correlations {{are dependent on}} so many parameter it becomes difficult to correlate. Correlation based on geometric similarity has been developed by many industries in form of charts, graphs, data statistics and performance data. Two-dimensional losses are easily evaluated by Navier-Stokes code but three-dimensional losses are difficult to evaluate so, correlation is used.

The objective {{of these tests}} was to evaluate the potential acoustic benefits of main rotors with modulated (uneven) <b>blade</b> <b>spacing.</b> Sound simulations were prepared for six main rotor configurations. A baseline 4 -blade main rotor with regular <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> {{was based on the}} Bell Model 427 helicopter. A 5 -blade main rotor with regular spacing was designed to approximate the performance of the 427, but at reduced tipspeed. Four modulated rotors - one with "optimum" spacing and three alternate configurations - were derived from the 5 bladed regular spacing rotor. The sounds were played to 2 subjects at a time, with care being taken in the speaker selection and placement to ensure that the sounds were identical for each subject. A total of 40 subjects participated. For each rotor configuration, the listeners were asked to evaluate the sounds in terms of noisiness. The test results indicate little to no "annoyance" benefit for the modulated <b>blade</b> <b>spacing.</b> In general, the subjects preferred the sound of the 5 -blade regular spaced rotor over any of the modulated ones. A conclusion is that modulated <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> is not a promising design feature to reduce the annoyance for helicopter main rotors...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} on the noise characteristics of four-bladed general aviation propellers with uneven <b>blade</b> <b>spacing.</b> The subscale propeller designs were inspired by the fourbladed McCauley propellers used on the Beechcraft King Air 350 series aircraft. The 4 -inch diameter (1 : 22. 5 scale) propellers were manufactured using high-resolution stereolithography and were powered by a high performance, radio controlled brushless electric motor. Acoustic measurements were taken with a 24 -microphone array. The use of uneven <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> created additional tones over which the acoustic intensity was distributed. Large amounts of acoustic intensity were shifted into the lowest frequency tone (occuring at half of the blade passage frequency of the propeller with evenly spaced blades), resulting in reductions of A-weighted overall sound pressure levels of up to 5 dB for polar angles near 90. These reduction are partly offset by increases in A-weighted overall sound pressure levels of up to 4 dB at polar angles less than 50. Although the theory used to predict propeller noise does not show good agreement with experiments, it does show this trend of increasing noise at low polar angles. Since noise at low polar angles are weighted less in noise metrics such as flyover noise, the use of uneven <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> has potential for providing noise reduction without adding excessive complexity to propeller design...|$|E

40|$|As {{part of a}} NASA {{initiative}} to reduce helicopter main rotor noise, a Phase 1 study has been performed of candidate noise reduction concepts. Both conventional and novel design technologies have been analyzed that reduce the community impact of helicopter operations. In this study the noise reduction potential and design implications are assessed for conventional means of noise reduction, e. g., tip speed reduction, tip shapes and airfoil tailoring, and for two innovative design concepts: modulated <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> and x-force control. Main rotor designs that incorporate modulated <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> are shown to have reduced peak noise levels in most flight operations. X-force control alters the helicopter's force balance whereby the miss distance between main rotor blades and shed vortices can be controlled. This control provides a high potential to mitigate BVI noise radiation. Each concept is evaluated using best practice design and analysis methods, achieving the study's aim to significantly reduce noise with minimal performance degradation and no vibration increase. It is concluded that a SILENT main rotor design, incorporating the modulated <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> concept, offers significantly reduced noise levels and the potential of a breakthrough in how a helicopter's sound is perceived and judged. The SILENT rotor represents a definite advancement in the state-of-the-art and is selected as the design concept for demonstration in Phase 2.

40|$|The {{requirements}} on gas turbines for aircraft power units, namely, adequate efficiency, operation at high gas temperatures, low weight, and small dimensions, {{must be taken}} into consideration during the design of the blading. To secure good efficiency, it is necessary that the gas flow past the blades as smoothly as possible without separation. This is relatively easily obtainable in the accelerated flow of turbine blading, if the <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> is chosen small enough. A small <b>blade</b> <b>spacing,</b> however, is detrimental to the other requirements outlined above. Operation at high gas temperatures usually calls for blade cooling. This cooling is associated with a power input that lowers the turbine efficiency. Since the amount of heat that must be carried off for coding a blade can be influenced rather little, the gross power input for a turbine stage can be reduced by keeping the number of blades to a minimum, that is, with blades of high spacing ratio. But here also a limit is imposed, the exceeding of which is followed by separation of flow. Hence the requirement of finding blade forms on which the flow separates at rather high spacing ratios...|$|E
40|$|Analytically, uneven (modulated) spacing of {{main rotor}} blades {{was found to}} reduce {{helicopter}} noise.

In general the evenly spaced configurations were found less noisy than the modulated spacings, possibly because the uneven spacings produced a perceptible pulsating sound due to the very low fundamental frequency.

Significant research is dedicated to its improvement of cultivation and processing. Kappaphycus alvarezii, a macroalgae, has spread throughout Southeast Asia and has been cultivated in many regions. The reliable cash income supports many coastal fishing communities. Separation of the solid-liquid fractions of fresh seaweed may provide additional value to seaweed farmers. Seaweed prices fluctuate due to variations in seaweed quality at the farm level. In addition, seaweed mostly grows better {{during the rainy season}} when {{there is a lack of}} sunlight to facilitate drying required for trade. If the seaweed can be immediately processed without drying and two products are obtained from liquid and solid separation, it will save space for drying and cost for adding new drying infrastructures. The liquid is used for agriculture fertilizer and the dry cake is used as an aquatic feed additive. Six factors were studied to improve liquid extraction with mechanical expression using a fractional factorial design with two levels. The high levels of factors are coded + 1 and lower levels coded as- 1. The lower level Comitrol™ <b>blade</b> <b>space</b> (1 mm <b>blade</b> <b>space),</b> low level initial temperature (22 oC), low initial weight (20 gram) and high level final pressure (2800 Pa) gave the highest liquid recovery from Kappaphycus alvarezii.
