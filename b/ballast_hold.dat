40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{introduces}} a fatigue assessment procedure using mesh-insensitive structural stress method {{based on the}} Common Structural Rules for Bulk Carriers by considering important factors, such as mean stress and thickness effects. The fatigue assessment result of mesh-insensitive structural stress method have been compared with CSR procedure based on equivalent notch stress at major hot spot points in the area near the <b>ballast</b> <b>hold</b> for a 180 K bulk carrier. The possibility of implementing mesh-insensitive structural stress method in the fatigue assessment procedure for ship structures is discussed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the interlocking behaviour of geogrid-reinforced railway ballast. Experimental large box pullout tests were conducted to examine the interaction between ballast and the biaxial geogrid. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) has then been used to model the interaction between ballast and geogrid by simulating large box pullout tests and comparing with experimental results. The DEM simulation results have been shown to provide good predictions of the pull-out resistance and examine the effect of clump shape on the pull-out resistance and also the distribution of contact forces.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the behaviour of geogrid-reinforced railway ballast. Experimental large box pull-out tests were conducted to examine the key parameters influencing the interaction between ballast and the geogrid. The experimental results demonstrated that the triaxial geogrid outperforms the biaxial geogrid and the geogrid aperture size is more influential than rib profile and junction profile. The discrete element method (DEM) has then been used to model the interaction between ballast and geogrid by simulating large box pull-out tests and comparing with experimental results. The DEM simulation results have been shown to provide good predictions of the pull-out resistance and reveal the distribution of contact forces in the geogrid-reinforced ballast system.

The discrete element method (DEM) was then used to model the interaction between the ballast and the geogrid by simulating large box pull-out tests and comparing the findings with the experimental results. Four different shapes of clumps were used to represent each ballast particle in order to obtain an acceptable shape for modelling the railway ballast. The DEM simulation results were shown to provide good predictions of the pull-out resistance and to examine the effect of clump shape on both the pull-out resistance and the distribution of contact forces.

60|$|It was a {{month later}} when Jimmy Wheelock stood leaning on the Tyee's rail one morning, while she lay {{alongside}} a sawmill wharf at Vancouver. The Siwash deck-hand had left them, and Jimmy, who had done his work, was very hot and grimy after trimming <b>ballast</b> in the <b>hold.</b> He and Prescott were waiting for another few loads of it, and expected that the Tyee would go to sea shortly after they got them.

[...] The Mayflower lay in New Plymouth harbor through the winter of 1620–21, then set sail for England on April 5, 1621, her empty <b>hold</b> <b>ballasted</b> with stones from the Plymouth Harbor shore.

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide {{produced}} by sulfate-reducing bacteria {{is a well}} recognised toxic hazard in storage tanks on HMA Ships, however, {{it also has the}} potential to be an explosive hazard. Hydrogen sulfide can cause explosions when its concentration exceeds 4 % in air. A number of storage tanks on HMA Ships theoretically have the potential to produce enough hydrogen sulfide to exceed this figure. This report assesses the likelihood of this occurring in <b>ballast</b> and sewage <b>holding</b> tanks. Sewage tanks pose the greatest risk of an explosive hazard occurring and this situation is exacerbated when seawater is used for flushing or a concentrated sewage is produced due to reduced flushing volumes, as is the situation with EVAC systems. Ballast tanks that contain only seawater and Deiso F 76 pose minimal risk, but any contamination of the tanks with biodegradable material would increase this risk considerably...|$|R
60|$|Columbine's gig rubbed {{against the}} landing steps and Wyndham and Marston lounged {{about the end}} of the mole. The sun had sunk behind a high, black range and the land-breeze had begun to blow in gentle gusts that crisped the greasy water and dropped again. When the crew were {{trimming}} <b>ballast</b> in the <b>hold,</b> a man shouted that some chain Wyndham had ordered had arrived, and he and Marston pulled the gig to the steps. After putting the chain on board, they strolled to the town, where they drank a glass of wine and bought a newspaper; and then went back to the mole. For the last few nights they had slept on board, but it was early in the evening and the top of the wall was cooler than the deck of the yacht. Besides, a Spanish liner was steering for the port and they waited to watch her passengers land.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the origin of “shakedown cruise” comes from the need to settle (or literally shake down) the <b>ballast</b> in the <b>hold</b> of a ship to ensure it is level in the water. However, this would only apply to very granular ballast material such as sand. The term is more likely to have arisen due to the transition from sail to power. The advent of engines within the hull of a ship caused severe vibration. Such vibration would be aggravated by uneven running and different sea conditions. A new ship had many fixtures and fittings throughout its accommodation and work spaces. As the maiden voyage progressed, these would become loose, and in many cases fall to the deck (shaken down). For this reason, it was common for the shipyard to send a 'shake-down' team with the ship on her maiden voyage. These men would be specialists equipped with the proper tools and spares to relocate or replace any shake-down displaced fixtures or fittings.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the next}} five months Captain Jones and the Mayflower would remain in Plymouth.

John Alden, also fell ill but was nursed back to health by his eventual wife Priscilla Mullins. Priscilla lost all of her family to the unknown illness, whom she also nursed during that fateful winter. The Mayflower remained in Plymouth Harbor through the winter of 1620-1621 and then on 5 April, with her empty <b>hold</b> <b>ballasted</b> by stones from the Plymouth Harbor shore, Jones set sail for England.

500|$|Barnaby was {{severely}} criticised, particularly by Sir Edward Reed, himself a former Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy, because Collingwoods waterline armour belt was concentrated amidships {{and did not}} extend {{to the ends of}} the ship. Reed believed that this weakness meant that the ship could be sunk from the consequent uninhibited flooding if her unarmoured ends were riddled by shellfire and open to the sea. Barnaby deliberately selected a hull shape with narrow, fine ends to limit the volume of the hull that could be flooded and situated the armoured deck below the waterline to prevent it from being pierced by enemy shells and flooding the lower part of the ironclad. Furthermore, he heavily subdivided the hull to limit the amount of water that could enter through any one hit and placed coal bunkers above the armoured deck to absorb the fragments from exploding shells. Unbeknownst to his critics, Collingwood was tested in 1884 with her ends and the large spaces in her <b>hold</b> <b>ballasted</b> with water and her draught only increased by [...] and she lost a minor amount of speed. The price was that the ship lacked buoyancy at her ends and tended to bury her bow in oncoming waves rather than be lifted over them. Her speed was greatly reduced in a head sea and the resulting spray made working the guns very difficult. Collingwood tended to roll heavily and was not regarded as a good seaboat. Despite these issues, her basic configuration was followed by most subsequent British ironclads and predreadnought battleships until the revolutionary [...] of 1905.|$|R
40|$|Palaeozoic calcitic marbles {{are found}} in the Estremoz Anticline, Ossa-Morena Zone (Southern Branch of the European Variscides in Portugal). The 40 km NW-SE {{structure}} present outcrops continuity and intense mining activity since the Roman Period (fourth century BC). The structure has a Precambrian core and the younger rocks aged Devonian Period. The marbles occupy an intermediate stratigraphic position in the Cambrian age Volcano Sedimentary Sequence. The Variscan Orogeny performed twice with different intensities under ductile and brittle tension fields. The Alpine Cycle also acts and causes more fracturing of the marbles. These show spatial-temporal continuity of the deformation where a complete Wilson Cycle can be described. The geological features imprint the marbles beautiful aesthetic patterns that are highlighted when used as Dimension Stone (DS). The marbles exhibit physical properties allowing fabrication of structural and decorative elements. In the Roman period, pieces of art made with Estremoz Marbles were exported abroad and can be found in Museums and Archaeological Sites throughout Europe and North Africa countries. During the maritime expansion, altars, stairways, columns, statues, etc., were carried as <b>ballast</b> in the <b>holds</b> of ships. At the destination the Portuguese had built monuments which can now be found in South America and Africa countries. The Modern DS Industry Global Market allows Portuguese Marbles to be present all over the World. Notice that every variety of marble has enough reserves to sustain the mining activity for several hundreds of years. The Alentejo hallmark whitewashed houses are a landscape that can only have been developed by the availability of marbles to produce quicklime. The marble based built heritage is very rich and is always present. The countryside is marked by intense mining activity living side by side with rural industries, namely wheat fields, groves, orchards and vineyards; therefore the region has unique characteristics allowing the development of integrated industrial tourism routes, promoting sustainable development of industrial, scientific and technological culture opportunities.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present and justify the reasons for the worldwide recognition of Portuguese Marbles as Stone Heritage. These marbles are also known as “Estremoz Marble” since was the first county were exploited. In the Estremoz Anticline marbles occupy an intermediate stratigraphic position being part of a volcano-sedimentary sequence of Cambrian age. The anticlinal structure has a Precambrian core and the younger rocks aged Devonian Period. This sequence has deformed by the Variscan Orogeny, which performed twice with different intensities both in ductile and brittle tension fields. The early Alpine Cycle also acts in the region and cause more fracturing of the marble. Practically in all the quarries is possible to perceive the spatial-temporal continuity of the deformation where one can describe a complete Wilson Cycle. Together all these geological features imprint the marbles beautiful aesthetic patterns that can be highlighted when used as dimension stone. Nowadays most of the quarries are placed in the counties of Borba and mainly in Vila Viçosa. This last city claims for itself the “Capital of the Marble” title and named the marble as “White Gold”. In fact, according to the historical record, the marbles were quarried in Portuguese Alentejo’s Province since the fourth century BC. Locally these geological materials are available easily accessible. Exhibit physical properties that allow the fabrication of structural and decorative elements and so were used since humans settled in the region and developed a structured Society. In the Roman period, the pieces of art made with Estremoz Marbles were exported abroad and today are represented in Museums and Archaeological Sites throughout Europe and North Africa countries. The Portuguese Marbles and Limestones, transformed into altars, stairways, columns, statues and pieces of wall cladding, were carried as <b>ballast</b> in the <b>holds</b> of ships.
