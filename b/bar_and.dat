At 6,500 <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> 41.5 °C {{there are two different}} clathrates, the low pressure hydrate, and hydrate-1. At 12,500 <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> 46.5° hydrate-1 and −2 are in equilibrium, <b>and</b> at 15,250 <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> 52.5° above which there is no liquid water, but rather ice 6.|$|R

5|$|Later that evening, several police cruisers {{filled with}} {{officers}} wearing riot gear {{arrived at the}} Elephant Walk Bar on Castro Street. Harvey Milk's protégé Cleve Jones and {{a reporter for the}} San Francisco Chronicle, Warren Hinckle, watched as officers stormed into the <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> began to beat patrons at random. After a 15-minute melee, they left the <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> struck out at people walking along the street. The chief of police finally ordered the officers out of the neighborhood. By morning, 61 police officers and 100 rioters and gay residents of the Castro had been hospitalized. City Hall, police cruisers, and the Elephant Walk Bar suffered damages in excess of $1,000,000.|$|E

50|$|The UPC-A barcode is {{visually}} {{represented by}} strips of <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> spaces, that encode the UPC-A 12-digit number.

The total width for a digit is always 7 modules, consequently UPC-A 12-digit number requires a total of 7&times;12 = 84 modules.|$|R
5|$|The Norwegian {{saturation}} decompression {{tables are}} similar, but specifically {{do not allow}} decompression to start with an upward excursion.

5|$|The {{composition}} of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with {{the temperature in the}} range 100–160K and pressures extending between 0.5–2 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185–270K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3–6 bar with temperatures of 190–235K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10–20 <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> temperatures are 270–330K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The central kpc of barred galaxies {{exhibits}} {{a wealth of}} morphological information on different components with clear dynamical consequences. These include nuclear rings, spirals, <b>bars,</b> <b>and</b> more. We argue that this morphology is driven by large-scale stellar <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> analyze its consequences for gas dynamics {{and the distribution of}} star-forming regions. Specifically, we focus on gas flows in nested <b>bar</b> systems <b>and</b> study their origin, as well as the gravitational decoupling of gaseous nuclear <b>bars</b> with <b>and</b> without gas self-gravity. We find that the gas response in nested bars differs profoundly from that in single <b>bars,</b> <b>and</b> that no offset dust lanes form in the nuclear bars. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{businesses}} along Ossington Avenue {{just north}} of Queen Street have {{changed in the last}} decade, with former sports <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> social clubs becoming trendy restaurants, <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> cafes.
