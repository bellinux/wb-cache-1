5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Clay Shaw {{takes place in}} 1969. Garrison {{presents}} the court with further evidence of multiple killers and dismissing the single bullet theory, and proposes a Dealey Plaza shots scenario involving three assassins who fired six total shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and officer J. D. Tippit <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. The film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly that they believed there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy. Shaw {{died of lung cancer}} in 1974, but in 1979 Richard Helms testified that Clay Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA. The end credits claim that records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029.|$|E
25|$|Lewis {{had several}} run-ins with Lord Howard de Walden, his Oxford Street landlord, and in 1903 he spent {{three weeks in}} Brixton Prison for defying a court order {{obtained}} by de Walden. In 1911, de Walden sued him for libel; Lewis was found guilty, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> awarded damages of just a farthing.|$|E

25|$|On May 10, 2007, Juan Luna {{was found}} guilty of all seven counts of murder. He was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without parole on May 17. The state had sought the death penalty, which was {{available}} at <b>the</b> time, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury's</b> vote of eleven-to-one in favor of the death penalty fell short of the required unanimity to impose it.|$|R

25|$|However, {{there was}} also some police evidence, and the {{prosecution}} had strongly associated the matter with the Sydney Hilton bombing. The trial relating to the alleged plot to bomb Cameron's home began in February 1979, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> could not come to a verdict. A second trial was held in July and all three defendants were convicted.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Gillespie was {{involved}} in a traffic accident when the bicycle he was riding was bumped by an automobile. He was slightly injured, and found that he could no longer hit the B-flat above high C. He won the case, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> awarded him only $1000, in view of his high earnings up to that point.|$|E

50|$|Italy has {{finished}} in the top ten in five of the last seven contests (2011-17). In , Il Volo won the televoting receiving votes from all countries, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>juries</b> placed them sixth, ending with a third place overall. Since the introduction of the 50/50 voting system in 2009, {{this was the first time}} that the winner of the viewers vote did not win the contest.|$|R

Zenger's lawyers, Andrew Hamilton and William Smith, Sr., successfully argued that truth is a defense against charges of libel. After it, James De Lancey tried to convince the nineteen members of <b>the</b> Grand <b>Jury</b> that [...] "just by reading the articles, one could tell that they were libels", <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Grand <b>Jury</b> returned no indictment again.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{following}} episode, Gordon could not participate for one show {{because he was}} giving a concert with his group, De Toppers in the Amsterdam ArenA. Edsilia Rombley was asked as guest judge/coach for him, in this episode. His last remaining act, BadBoyz was voted off on this episode. As a consequence, Gordon threatened to leave X Factor. He later explained however, that, [...] "it was not the elimination of BadBoyz, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurys</b> criticisms that caused me to reconsider my job. I will attend the show on Friday unless something else comes up." ...|$|R
25|$|In December 2005 four {{youths were}} found guilty of Morley's manslaughter. A 15-year-old girl, Chelsea O'Mahoney was sentenced to an 8-year {{custodial}} sentence. Her co-defendants Reece Sargeant (21), Darren Case (18) and David Blenman (17), all from Kennington, South London, were sentenced to 12 years each. They had been prosecuted for murder, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> returned a verdict of manslaughter as they are permitted to do.|$|E
25|$|Due to the 1795 Treason Act, {{there was}} little legal {{distinction}} between plotting treason and committing treason. The jury {{was impressed by the}} Colonel's character references such as that given by Evan Neppean and Horatio Nelson, who had been his companion in Honduras; the jury was also unsure about the lack of solid evidence, and consequently Despard and his colleagues were found guilty of high treason <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> recommended mercy.|$|E
25|$|Whites {{continued}} {{to resort to}} lynchings to keep dominance, and tensions rose. White mobs committed murders, accompanied by wholesale destruction of black houses, churches and schools, in the small communities of Ocoee, November 1920; Perry in December 1922; and Rosewood in January 1923. The governor appointed a special grand jury and special prosecuting attorney to investigate Rosewood and Levy County, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> did not find sufficient evidence to prosecute. Rosewood was never resettled.|$|E
50|$|In April 2004, Williams {{was acquitted}} of the more serious charges against him, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> court's <b>jury</b> deadlocked {{on a charge of}} {{reckless}} manslaughter. He was convicted on four counts of trying to cover up the shooting.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked if}} Zimmerman had been {{overcharged}} in the case, State Attorney Angela Corey told reporters {{after the verdict}} that the allegations against Zimmerman [...] "fit the bill" [...] for a second-degree murder charge.

500|$|Lord Alverstone told <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that <b>the</b> {{case was}} an {{important}} one of national interest. He called The Shambles of Science [...] "hysterical", <b>but</b> advised <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> not to be swayed by arguments {{about the validity of}} vivisection. After retiring for 25 minutes on 18 November 1903, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> unanimously found that Bayliss had been defamed, to the applause of physicians in the public gallery. Bayliss was awarded £2,000 with £3,000 costs; Coleridge gave him a cheque the next day.|$|R
25|$|Seurat {{completed}} {{the painting of}} Bathers at Asnières in 1884, when he was twenty-four years old. He applied to the jury of the Salon {{of the same year}} to have the work exhibited there, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> rejected it. The Bathers continued to puzzle many of Seurat’s contemporaries, and the picture was not widely acclaimed until many years after the death of the artist at the age of just thirty-one. An appreciation of the painting’s merits grew during the twentieth century, and today it hangs in the National Gallery, London, where it {{is considered one of the}} highlights of the gallery’s collection of paintings.|$|E
25|$|Harper {{returned}} to situation comedy in 1986 when she played family matriarch Valerie Hogan on the NBC series Valerie. Following a salary dispute with NBC and production company Lorimar in 1987, Harper {{was fired from}} the series {{at the end of}} its second season. Harper sued NBC and Lorimar for breach of contract. Her claims against NBC were dismissed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> found that Lorimar had wrongfully fired her and awarded her $1.4 million plus 12.5 percent of the show's profits. The series continued without her with the explanation that her character had died off-screen. In 1987, it was initially renamed Valerie's Family and then The Hogan Family, as Harper was replaced by actress Sandy Duncan, who played her sister-in-law Sandy Hogan. NBC canceled The Hogan Family in 1990, but CBS picked-up the series for a final season.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the fourteenth}} century {{there are only a}} few scanty notices, the only events told at any length being those {{connected}} with the Peasants' Revolt in 1381, when the prior, Thomas Marshall, appears by his courage and moderation to have saved his own house from serious loss, and his burghers from punishment. In 1349 an attempt was made by Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, and marshal of the kingdom, to prove that the prior held his lands by barony; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> which was summoned at that time declared upon oath that the lands had always been held in pure and perpetual alms. Henry VI visited Dunstable in 1459, but there is no record of his relations with the priory; its history during the fifteenth century is not recorded in any way. But in the sixteenth century it was again connected with an important historical event, when on 23 May 1533, in the Lady Chapel of the conventual church at Dunstable, Archbishop Cranmer together with and the bishops of Winchester, London, Bath and Lincoln pronounced the marriage between Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon to be null and void. The location arose as Catherine was then residing at nearby Ampthill, some 12 miles to the north. In 1535 the prior, Gervase Markham, with twelve canons, signed the acknowledgement of the Royal Supremacy, and on 20 January 1540-1, he surrendered his house to the king and received a pension of £60.|$|E
2500|$|Cheek was convicted, <b>but</b> during <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> deliberations, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> asked <b>the</b> {{trial judge}} for a {{clarification}} on the law.

[...] The trial court also instructed <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> that [...] "dvice or research resulting in the conclusion that wages of a privately employed person are not income or that the tax laws are unconstitutional is not objectively reasonable, and cannot {{serve as the basis}} for a good faith misunderstanding of the law defense." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Vo Ime Na Ljubovta" [...] ("Во Име На Љубовта"; {{translated}} [...] "In the Name of Love"), {{is a song}} by Tamara Todevska, Vrčak and Adrian Gaxha. The trio {{competed with}} the song at Skopje Fest 2008. The song won, having been awarded the most televotes {{by the general public}} and <b>the</b> 7-member expert <b>jury.</b> <b>The</b> English language version ("Let Me Love You") represented Republic of Macedonia at the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest in Belgrade, Serbia, on 22 May 2008.

So evidence of outside forces attempting to influence <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> is admissible, <b>but</b> testimony from <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> of whether they were influenced is not admissible.|$|R
500|$|Gradually, {{the cases}} of the other {{officers}} named in Wilson's suit were resolved. On March 15, 1989, Sergeant Thomas McKenna was acquitted of brutality; and on March 30, 1989, detectives John Yucaitis and Patrick O'Hara were each acquitted of charges by a unanimous jury. <b>But,</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> was at an impasse on the Burge verdict.|$|E
500|$|Briggs' {{argument}} {{was used in}} the 1849 trial of Washington Goode, a black mariner accused of killing a rival for the affections of a lady. [...] The case against Goode was essentially circumstantial, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> heeded the district attorney's call for assertive punishment of [...] "crimes of violence" [...] and convicted him. [...] There were calls for Briggs to commute Goode's capital sentence, but he refused, writing [...] "A pardon here would tend toward the utter subversion of the law." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Vivian MacMillan, {{a family}} friend, sued Brownlee for seduction. [...] Brownlee denied any sexual relationship, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> found in MacMillan's favour. Though the judge disregarded the jury's verdict, the trial's lurid {{testimony}} and the stigma {{resulting from the}} jury's finding forced Brownlee's resignation as premier. [...] He ran for re-election in Ponoka in the 1935 provincial election but was defeated, as William Aberhart's Social Credit League swept the province. [...] Once out of politics, Brownlee resumed {{the practice of law}} and joined the management of the UGG, serving as its president and general manager from 1948 until shortly before his death in 1961.|$|E

500|$|On December 17, 2008, Greg Forestell, the province's acting chief coroner, {{called for}} an inquiry into the accident, stating that [...] "he inquest gives us the {{opportunity}} to pull all those facts together in a comprehensive manner and look at the issues in their entirety and have the jury make recommendations for prevention." [...] The decision was met with much approval from the victims' families. The inquest began on May 4, 2009 and lasted until May 14. [...] It included testimony from survivors, experts, and provincial officials.

500|$|In June 1923, Leane {{brought a}} case of {{defamation}} against Harry Kneebone, {{the editor of the}} Australian Labor Party (ALP) Daily Herald newspaper. The case alleged that Kneebone had impugned Leane's reputation over the conduct of the 3rd Infantry Brigade annual camp at Wingfield in March that year, over which Leane had presided. The paper had described the camp as a [...] "breeding ground for outlawry", had claimed that discipline was lacking, and that the food and accommodation was poor, among other things. Bill Denny, a lawyer and ALP Member of Parliament, represented Kneebone. It was determined that there was a prima facie case against the defendant, and the matter was scheduled for trial in the Supreme Court in October, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> was unable to come to a verdict and were dismissed. The case was abandoned in November.|$|E
500|$|James Strang, {{a would-be}} {{successor}} to the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., proclaimed himself [...] "king" [...] over his church in 1850, which was then concentrated mostly on Beaver Island in Lake Michigan. [...] On 8 July of that year, he was physically crowned in an elaborate coronation ceremony complete with crown, sceptre, throne, ermine robe and breastplate. [...] Although he never claimed legal sovereignty over Beaver Island or any other geographical entity, Strang managed (as {{a member of the}} Michigan State Legislature) to have his [...] "kingdom" [...] constituted as a separate county, where his followers held all county offices, and Strang's word was law. [...] U.S. President Millard Fillmore ordered an investigation into Strang's colony, which resulted in Strang's trial in Detroit for treason, trespass, counterfeiting and other crimes, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> found the [...] "king" [...] innocent of all charges.
