It was subsequently taken up by other engineers, notably his namesake William Adams, Locomotive Superintendent of the LSWR, who introduced a class now known as [...] "Adams Radials".|$|R
40|$|Translation and {{transference}} — {{although these}} two concepts have acquired different meanings in modern English {{specific to the}} contexts of language and psychoanalysis, they {{can be traced back}} etymologically to the same Latin roots — the past participle of transferre being translatus, meaning bear/borne — and to the Greek metaphor. 2 These concepts evoke motion, direction — not simply <b>bearing</b> <b>or</b> <b>carrying</b> as one does a child or a burden, but carrying that something across, relocating it somewhere tangential, somewhere new. Motion intimates that translation and transference can be theorized both as metaphor and metonymy, as an interstice of the two, not a “mere representation … but [also] a continuation, as derived metonymically from the past … and metonymically related too to the interpretive discourse that combats it ” (Chase, p. 218). This article charts parallel developments in translation studies and psychoanalysis, relating the concept of transference at each of the successive 1 The author {{would like to thank the}} SSHRC for its generous financial support, Christine Wiesenthal for her thoughtful reading of an earlier draft of this article, and Piotr Fast for publishing an earlier version in the Polis...|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} {{disengage}} her arm, {{but she was}} persistent. She took no notice of Allan, who tried to lead her away. I stole a glance at her through the darkness. Her face was white, {{but there were no}} signs of fear there, nor were there any signs of childishness in her manner <b>or</b> <b>bearing.</b> She <b>carried</b> herself like an angry young princess, and her eyes seemed lit with smouldering fire, as clinging to my arm she leaned a little forwards toward the Baron.|$|R
5000|$|All four axles of the {{locomotives}} - {{even the}} <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> - {{were more or}} less equally loaded with a hefty 16 tonnes. The <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> was linked to the first coupled axle via a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie. The axles were located in a plate frame, inside which a well tank was rivetted.|$|R
50|$|The bogie {{comprises}} a <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> {{connected to}} a coupled axle via a shaft or lever. In straight running, any radial movement of the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> results in a sideways movement of the coupled axle in the opposite direction. However, the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> is centred by means of two heavy duty springs just behind it. In addition the pivot pin may be allowed to move sideways, but again is held centrally by heavy springs. When travelling round a curve, the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> swings to one side causing the coupled axle to move sideways in the opposite direction. In this way radial forces during curve running {{are more or less}} evened out on both axles, so that riding qualities similar to those of a normal bogie are achieved and wear and tear reduced on wheel flanges and rails.|$|R
5000|$|The Schwartzkopff-Eckhardt II bogie is {{a further}} {{refinement}} of the Krauss-Helmholtz bogie, whereby two coupled <b>axles</b> and the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> are combined within the bogie. The <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> steers the second coupled axle via a long shaft and this also moves the first coupled axle via a Beugniot lever. This bogie is used on the DRG Class 84. Whether DR Class 99.23-24 locomotives were also fitted with this arrangement is not entirely clear.|$|R
5000|$|These {{locomotives}} {{were the}} first compound locomotives in Saxony. Its two-cylinder, compound engine was located behind the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> and drove the final axle. The locomotives had an inside Allan valve gear. The steam dome was in {{the centre of the}} boiler over the middle axle. The running gear had an improved Nowotny <b>carrying</b> <b>axle,</b> nevertheless it did not have good riding qualities. The Schleifer brakes were later converted to Westinghouse brakes.|$|R
5000|$|Class T 5 of the Palatinate Railway was a German, goods train, tank {{locomotive}} {{class with}} five coupled <b>axles</b> and no <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the Planets, most {{passenger}} locomotives {{began to}} use a 2-2-2 arrangement, with an additional front <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> to give better riding at speed.|$|R
5000|$|For the brakes, there was, {{next to the}} smokebox a {{single-stage}} air pump, and {{in front}} of the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> were one <b>or</b> two air reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|The main {{rationale}} for locating the earlier G 2/2+2/3 class's sole <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> {{in a position}} under the locomotive's cab had been that it increased the locomotive's operating reserves. However, it quickly became apparent that these changes had not improved the locomotive's ride quality, and that the G 2/2+2/3 class caused similarly high flange and track wear as their predecessors, the G 2x2/2 class. That was the basis on which the G 2/3+2/2 class was later built with a leading <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> instead of a trailing one.|$|R
50|$|Springing of the {{coupled axles}} was {{achieved}} using overhung leaf springs. The spring elements were linked by equalising beams. On the <b>carrying</b> <b>axles,</b> transverse leaf springs were used.|$|R
50|$|As {{the driving}} wheels {{were small and}} articulated, {{there was no need}} for {{separate}} <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b> All wheels could be powered, so that the locomotive's entire weight could be used for adhesion.|$|R
50|$|The driving axles {{were fixed}} rigidly into the {{locomotive}} frame. To improve curve running the wheel flanges {{of the driving}} wheels were reduced. The <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> were designed as Adams axles and had leaf return springs.|$|R
50|$|The {{first series}} of E I's {{was built by}} Krauss in 12 examples. The {{cylinders}} were positioned {{in front of the}} <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> and drove the first coupled <b>axle.</b> The <b>carrying</b> and driving <b>axles</b> were linked together in a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie. In addition the outside Walschaerts (Heusinger) valve gear had very short connecting rods on the engines delivered to Bavaria.|$|R
50|$|The three driven {{wheelsets}} {{are fixed}} firmly {{in a bar}} frame with a 70 mm side thickness (Wangenstärke). The two front and rear <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> are able to swing out radially and are housed in a Bissell truck.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{variously}} estimated {{that one out}} of six couplesl or 15 - 20 percent of couples 2 1 are infertile. The changes in social attitudes and social welfare policies towards single mothers together with the increased use of contraception and abortion mean that the demand for adoptable babies now surpasses the supply. Those infertile couples who are frustrated by the long adoption procedures and are unable to be helped through the Artificial Insemination by Donor (AID) or In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) programmes are turning in increasing numbers to a practice with a long history which has only recently gained world-wide attention - the practice of surrogate motherhood. The practice of surrogacy dates back at least to Biblical times. One of the first recorded instances is found in the Old Testament. Almost 4 000 years ago Sarah, the wife of Abraham, could not conceive and sent her husband to her Egyptian maid Hagar saying "It may be that I may obtain children by her". Hagar thus bore Ismael. Another example is that of Rachel, wife of Jacob, who required Billa to "bear upon my knees that I may also have a child by her". Jacob's other wife, Leah, had the same arrangement with her slave-girl Zilpah. Today, surrogate motherhood has provoked considerable debate on the moral, ethical, legal, and social consequences, issues to which existing legislation has failed adequately to address itself. In a jurisdiction where no specific legislation on surrogacy exists, the application of existing laws produce distorted results which are beyond the probable legislative intent. Where specific legislation prohibits the practice of surrogacy, it has failed to recognize long term implications of such prohibition. Most of the known cases of surrogacy arrangements involve the insemination of the surrogate with the sperm of the husband of the infertile couple. The insemination of the surrogate with the sperm of a person other than the husband of the infertile couple is, of course, a possibility, but would probably be a method resorted to only where both the wife and husband are infertile. In this case, the resultant child has no genetic link with his intended parents. The expression infertile couple in this paper is used to denote a couple where the wife is incapable of <b>bearing,</b> <b>or</b> <b>carrying</b> to term, a child. Discussion in this paper is limited to infertile couples who participate in surrogacy arrangements by the most common means of the artificial insemination of the surrogate by the sperm of the husband. It is by the use of such a practice that the major ethical and legal issues arise...|$|R
5000|$|The new {{layout and}} the length of the {{wheelbase}} were a concern, and a means was needed to provide some flexibility. Flamme had used a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie where the front <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> and the leading driver were articulated as a bogie.|$|R
50|$|The main {{rationale}} for locating the G 2/2+2/3 class's sole <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> {{in a position}} under the locomotive's cab was that it increased the locomotive's operating reserves. As the boiler and chassis dimensions remained essentially the same, only the boiler pressure was increased from 12 to 14 atms. Consequently, the high-pressure cylinder diameter was minimised, and the rather large rear overhang was reduced. However, it quickly became apparent that these changes did not improve the locomotive's ride quality, and that the locomotives caused similarly high flange and track wear as their predecessors. That was the basis on which the G 2/3+2/2 class was later built with a leading <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> instead of a trailing one.|$|R
2500|$|Cornwall was {{an attempt}} to avoid the {{damaging}} long wheelbase of the Cramptons, whilst still permitting large driving wheels. By moving the driving axle ahead of the firebox, one of the <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> could be moved backwards, giving a shorter overall wheelbase. The difficulty of how to fit the axles past the boiler recurred, to which Trevithick provided an [...] "extremely complicated" [...] solution. The boiler was placed entirely underneath the driving axle. Even then, it was necessary to recess a transverse channel {{across the top of the}} boiler, so as to provide clearance for the driving <b>axle.</b> The trailing <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> passed through a crosswise tube through the middle of the firebox. This made assembly difficult, but as it was only a straight <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> rather than a cranked driving axle, the tube diameter required was manageable. This use of a cross-firebox axle tube was part of Crampton's patent of 1842.

50|$|In {{spite of}} the extra <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> the top speed could only be raised to 45 km/h, so that later rebuilds or new engines {{were based on the}} GtL 4/4 (the rebuild {{becoming}} the DRG Class 98.11 (1'D)) and LAG Nos. 87 and 88 (1'D1')).|$|R

5000|$|Characteristic of ÜK {{locomotives}} are e.g. {{disc wheels}} on the <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> and {{the omission of}} the front side windows in the driver's cabs.

50|$|Because, today, {{locomotives}} {{no longer}} {{tend to have}} separate driving and <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> (see wheel arrangement), as was formerly common with steam locomotives, but usually have bogies where all axles are driven, the term running gear is (inaccurately) superseding the term 'driving gear' {{in some parts of}} the world.|$|R
50|$|Nineteen {{were built}} as the Pm class with plain {{bearings}} on the coupled axles and roller bearings on the <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b> The other sixteen were built as the Pmr class with roller bearings on all axles. One Pm was later {{converted to a}} Pmr at Midland Railway Workshops.|$|R
50|$|The {{coupled axles}} had {{overhung}} springing using leaf springs. An equalising beam, {{level with the}} axle boxes, linked the two springs. On the final batch of 1869 the springs were located underneath the axle boxes of the coupled wheels. On the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> the springs were above the frame.|$|R
5000|$|Eighteen of the Japanese [...] narrow-gauge Bo-Bo {{electric}} [...] were rebuilt in {{the late}} 1970s to form the Class ED62. An additional <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> was added between the bogies to give a Bo-1-Bo (AAR) or Bo'1Bo' (UIC) arrangement. The intention was to give a lighter axle loading for the Iida Line.|$|R
50|$|These tank {{locomotives}} {{were built}} for hauling goods trains and had three coupled <b>axles</b> but no <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b> All 110 examples {{went into the}} Deutsche Reichsbahn fleet where they were incorporated as DRG Class 89.3-4 in the numbering plan.

5000|$|A Bissel truck (also: Bissell {{truck or}} Bissel bogie) is a single-axled bogie which pivots towards {{the centre of}} a steam {{locomotive}} to enable it to negotiate curves more easily. Invented in 1857 by [...] and usually known as a pony truck, {{it is a very}} simple and common means of designing a <b>carrying</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
50|$|These ten-coupled {{locomotives}} had <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> {{housed in}} a Bissel bogie. The fixed third axle acted as the driving axle and had thinner wheel flanges to begin with. After 1945 its flanges were removed entirely to improve curve running still further. The wheelbase was 3,000 mm initially; this was later increased to 4,000 mm.|$|R
2500|$|A 3/5: Standard gauge {{locomotive}} with a {{top speed}} of over [...] (A), powered by steam (no traction type designator), with three drive axles (3) and a total of five axles (5), i.e. two <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b> [...] (This could also be the classification of a railcar with first class compartment.) The locomotive's tender is not included in the descriptor.|$|R
50|$|The bogie was {{connected}} with the chassis by pivot bearings, creating an articulated joint. In connection with this, there were two buffer springs, which, together with the centring springs of the mobile crosshead guides, counteracted any rolling of the bogie. The <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> was {{in the form of}} an Adams axle, and therefore had greater articulation than the bogie.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to their predecessors the machines {{were given a}} plate frame. Like them, however, the third axle is driven and the <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> are housed in a Bissel bogie. Two vacuum injectors form the feed water system. In order to enable brown coal firing, the grate area was increased {{compared with that of}} the Einheitslok.|$|R
50|$|The {{renumbering}} {{of electric}} locomotives followed in 1926/1927 {{and used a}} similar scheme as that employed for the steam locomotives, with a main class number and a serial number.

50|$|The engines had Allan valve gear, the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> was {{designed}} as an Adams axle and the steam dome was located on the front boiler ring. Various brake systems were tested on these locos. In the 1923 renumbering plan, three locomotives were earmarked for renumbering to 90 002, 066 and 067. However, by 1925 they had been retired.|$|R
