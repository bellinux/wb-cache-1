5|$|In April 2011, over 120 {{international}} artists urged a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> {{both the}} Louvre and Guggenheim museums over concerns regarding the abuse and exploitation of construction workers employed {{to develop the}} complex. In December 2013, The Guardian reported that conditions for the workers at the construction sites amount to modern-day slavery.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Meany {{was one of}} the {{permanent}} representatives of the AFL to the National War Labor Board. During the war, he established close relationships with prominent anticommunists in the American labor movement, including David Dubinsky, Jay Lovestone and Matthew Woll. In October 1945, he led the AFL <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the founding conference of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which welcomed participation by labor unions from the Soviet Union and was later called a communist front.|$|E
5|$|Jim Foster, {{then the}} most {{powerful}} political organizer in San Francisco, went to Miami to assist gay activists there as election day neared, and a nationwide <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> orange juice was organized. The message of the Save Our Children campaign was influential, {{and the result was}} an overwhelming defeat for gay activists; in the largest turnout in any special election in the history of Dade County, 70% voted to repeal the law.|$|E
5|$|No Code is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American rock band Pearl Jam, {{released}} on August 27, 1996 through Epic Records. Following a troubled tour for its previous album, Vitalogy (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> Ticketmaster, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse than what the band had done on previous releases, incorporating elements of garage rock and worldbeat.|$|E

5|$|On May 10, six {{downtown}} stores {{opened their}} lunch counters to black customers {{for the first}} time. The customers arrived in groups {{of two or three}} during the afternoon and were served without incident. At the same time, African Americans ended their six-week-old <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the downtown stores. The plan continued successfully and the lunch counters were integrated without any further incidents of violence. Nashville thus became the first major city in the South to begin desegregating its public facilities.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 All Blacks tour of {{apartheid}} South Africa generated much controversy {{and led to}} the <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal by 33 African nations after the IOC refused to ban the team. New Zealand again failed to win the test series in South Africa: they did not do so until 1996, after the fall {{of apartheid}}. The 1976 tour contributed to the Gleneagles Agreement being adopted by the Commonwealth Heads of State in 1977.|$|E

5|$|The year 1968 {{had seen}} {{turmoil in the}} United States, {{including}} riots and the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King. Prior to the Olympics in Mexico City in October 1968, some African Americans, led by activist Harry Edwards, had urged a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the Games, but found little enthusiasm among athletes, reluctant to waste years of effort. The atmosphere was made more tense by unrest in Mexico City before the Games which left dozens dead.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in protest of China's human rights record, and in {{response}} to Tibetan disturbances. Ultimately, no nation supported a boycott. In August 2008, the government of Georgia called for a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the 2014 Winter Olympics, set to be held in Sochi, Russia, in response to Russia's participation in the 2008 South Ossetia war.|$|E
5|$|This {{was not a}} universally popular attitude, and in 1909 Dmowski {{resigned}} {{his deputy}} mandate to focus on an internal political struggle within Endecja. He lost the election to the Fourth Duma in 1912 to a socialist politician, Eugeniusz Jagiełło from the Polish Socialist Party – Left, who won {{with the support of}} the Jewish vote.

5|$|With her doctor's approval, Leigh {{was well}} enough to resume acting in 1946, {{starring}} in a successful London production of Thornton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth; but her films of this period, Caesar and Cleopatra (1945) and Anna Karenina (1948), were not great commercial successes. All British films in this period were adversely affected by a Hollywood <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> British films.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{worked to}} {{coordinate}} {{resistance to the}} Coercive Acts. In May 1774, the Boston Town Meeting (with Adams serving as moderator) organized an economic <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> British goods. In June, Adams headed a committee in the Massachusetts House—with the doors locked to prevent Gage from dissolving the legislature—which proposed that an inter-colonial congress meet in Philadelphia in September. He was one of five delegates chosen to attend the First Continental Congress. Adams was never fashionably dressed and had little money, so friends bought him new clothes and paid his expenses for the journey to Philadelphia, his first trip outside of Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|As a young social worker, in 1963 Stephenson led a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the Bristol Omnibus Company, protesting {{against its}} refusal to employ Black or Asian drivers or conductors. After a 60-day boycott {{supported}} by thousands of Bristolians, the company revoked its colour bar in August. In 1964 Stephenson achieved national fame when he refused to leave a public house until he was served, resulting in a trial {{on a charge of}} failing to leave a licensed premises. His campaigns were instrumental in paving the way for the first Race Relations Act, in 1965. Stephenson is a Freeman of the City of Bristol and was awarded an OBE in 2009.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} {{three years after}} independence, the Naga National Council called for a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> Independence Day in {{northeast}} India. Separatist protests in this region intensified in the 1980s; calls for boycotts and terrorist attacks by insurgent organisations such as the United Liberation Front of Assam and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, marred celebrations. With increasing insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir from the late 1980s, separatist protesters boycotted Independence Day there with bandh (strikes), use of black flags and by flag burning. Terrorist outfits such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Hizbul Mujahideen and the Jaish-e-Mohammed have issued threats, and have carried out attacks around Independence Day. Boycotting of the celebration has also been advocated by insurgent Maoist rebel organisations.|$|E
5|$|Chad {{participated in}} 12 Summer Olympics between its debut at the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, Japan, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The only {{occasions}} {{in that period}} which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. On both occasions, it was because they had joined with international boycotts of the events. The first boycott {{was because of the}} inclusion of the New Zealand team at the Games despite the breach of the international sports <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> South Africa by the nation's rugby union team shortly prior. In 1980, Chad joined with the United States led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from athletics, Brundage became a sports administrator, rising rapidly {{through the ranks}} in United States sports groups. As leader of America's Olympic organizations, he fought zealously against a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the 1936 Summer Olympics, which had been awarded to Germany before the rise of its Nazi government and its subsequent, escalating persecution of Jews. Although Brundage was successful in getting a team to the Games in Berlin, its participation was controversial and has remained so. Brundage {{was elected to the}} IOC that year, and quickly became a major figure in the Olympic movement. He was elected IOC president in 1952.|$|E
