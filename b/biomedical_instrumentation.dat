40|$|AbstractThe {{effort to}} develop an {{electronic}} skin is highly motivated by many application domains namely robotics, <b>biomedical</b> <b>instrumentations,</b> and replacement prosthetic devices. Several e-skin systems have been proposed recently and have demonstrated the need of an embedded electronic system for tactile data processing either to mimic the human skin or {{to respond to the}} application demands. Processing tactile data requires efficient methods to extract meaningful information from raw sensors data. In this framework, our goal is the development of a dedicated embedded electronic system for electronic skin. The embedded electronic system has to acquire the tactile data, process and extract structured information. Machine Learning (ML) represents an effective method for data analysis in many domains: it has recently demonstrated its effectiveness in processing tactile sensors data. This paper presents an embedded electronic system based on dedicated hardware implementation for electronic skin systems. It provides a Tensorial kernel function implementation for machine learning based on Tensorial kernel approach. Results assess the time latency and the hardware complexity for real time functionality. The implementation results highlight the high amount of power consumption needed for the input touch modalities classification task. Conclusions and future perspectives are also presented...|$|R

40|$|Multilayer optical {{thin-film}} filters play {{a critical}} role in applications ranging from <b>biomedical</b> and analytical <b>instrumentation</b> to advanced laser systems. Although many of these applications still rely on outdated filter technology, there is light at the end of the tunnel, thanks to recent advances in optical thin films driven by the rigorous demands of the telecom industry. Optical thin-film filters typically consist of multiple alternating layers of high- and low-refractive-index material deposited on a glass substrate. They work based on the wavelength-dependent interference of light reflected or transmitted at the many interfaces between the layers. This filter technology took a revolutionary step forward as a result of developments driven by the challenging requirements of dense wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM) optical communications systems. Because of low loss, excellent spectral performance and capability for passive temperature compensation, thin-film filters rapidly became a key component The demands of telecom have advanced optical thin films for applications such as biotechnology...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Biomedical</b> Imaging and <b>Instrumentation</b> Group (BIIG) of the University Carlos III de Madrid is a {{multidisciplinary}} team involved in research projects within different fields. The lines of investigation in neuroimaging, {{which is one}} of their main focuses, draw into functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), processing and analysis.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a novel technique of designing a low noise high gain CMOS <b>instrumentation</b> amplifier for <b>biomedical</b> applications. A three op-amp instrumentation amplifier {{have been designed}} by employing two simple op-amps at the two inputs and a folded cascode op-amp at the output. Both input and output stage op-amps are 2 -stage. Most of the earlier designed op-amp in literature uses same type of op-amp at the input and output stages of instrumentation amplifier. By using folded cascode two stage op-amp at the output, we have achieved significant improvement in gain and CMRR. Transistors sizing plays {{a vital role in}} achieving high gain and CMRR. To achieve a desirable gain, common mode rejection ratio and other performance metrics, selection of most appropriate op-amp circuit topologies & optimum transistor sizing was the main criteria for design of <b>instrumentation</b> amplifier for <b>biomedical</b> applications. The <b>instrumentation</b> amplifier is simulated using Cadence Spectre tool and layout is designed in Cadence Layout editor at 0. 18 µm CMOS technology.

40|$|During the 70 ’s Computed Tomography (CT) {{opened the}} door to the {{possibility}} of obtaining anatomical information from living subjects non-invasively. Since then, this technology has become indispensable for clinical diagnostic in medicine as well as for sanitary research. Consequently, micro-CTs rose from the necessity in the preclinical environment of the advantages that CT offers to the clinicians, providing high-resolution images of small samples. The Universidad Carlos III de Madrid has designed a new high-resolution in-vitro x-ray micro-CT that will serve as a test bench for wide number of applications in research and teaching. The goal of this project is to implement a control and data acquisition software for this device. LabVIEW has been used as the development environment due to the advantages that offers in the creation of graphical user interfaces, its commodious configuration to communicate with many types of hardware elements and its flexibility to expand the software in future works with few modifications. This project comprises the development of a set of libraries to control the hardware elements: x-ray source, flat-panel detector and mechanical system of the UC 3 M test bench. In addition, the implementation of a “step and shoot” acquisition protocol is needed, which combines control libraries previously developed. The architecture of the implemented software leads to the possibility of expanding its functionalities into more advanced features such as advanced acquisition protocols or imaging techniques.

40|$|If it is {{one thing}} that Florida has in abundance, it is {{sunshine}} and with that sunshine heat and humidity. For workers at the Kennedy Space Center that have to work outside in the heat and humidity, heat exhaustion/stroke is a real possibility. It might help people to know that Kennedy's Biomedical Laboratory has been testing some new Koolvests(Trademark) that can be worn underneath SCAPE suits. They have also been working on how to block out high noise levels; in fact, Don Doerr, chief of the Biomedical Lab, says, "The most enjoyable aspect is knowing that the Biomedical Lab and the skills of its employees have been used to support safe space flight, not only for the astronaut flight crew, but just as important for the ground processing personnel as well. " The NASA Biomedical Laboratory has existed in the John F. Kennedy's Operations and Checkout Building since the Apollo Program. The primary mission of this laboratory has been the biomedical support to major, manned space programs that have included Apollo, Apollo-Soyuz, Skylab, and Shuttle. In this mission, the laboratory has been responsible in accomplishing much of the technical design, planning, provision, fabrication, and maintenance of flight and ground <b>biomedical</b> monitoring <b>instrumentation.</b> This includes the electronics in the launch flight suit and similar instrumentation systems in the spacecraft. (Note: The Lab checked out the system for STS- 128 at Pad A using Firing room 4 and ground support equipment in the lab.) During Apollo, there were six engineers and ten technicians in the facility. This has evolved today to two NASA engineers and two NASA technicians, a Life Science Support contract physiologist and part-time support from an LSSC nurse and physician. Over the years, the lab has enjoyed collaboration with outside agencies and investigators. These have included on-site support to the Ames Research Center bed rest studies (seven years) and the European Space Agency studies in Toulouse, France (two years). The lab has also actively collaborated with the US Army Institute for Surgical Research, the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, and the USN Naval Experimental Diving Unit. Because the lab often evaluates various forms of commercial-off-the-shelf life support equipment, the laboratory works closely with private companies, both domestic and foreign. The European companies seem to be more proactive and participatory with the advancement of personal protective equipment. Because these companies have viewed the space program's unique need for advanced forms of personal protective equipment, some have responded with new designs based on the prediction that these advances will soon find markets in the commercial sector. Using much of the same skills and equipment, the laboratory also addresses physiological testing of humans by supporting flight experiments and personnel involved with ground processing. While Johnson Space Center is primarily responsible for flight experiments, the Kennedy's Biomedical Lab provides the local support. However, as stated above, there are many challenges facing KSC workers that gain the attention of this lab in the measurement of the problem and the selection and testing of countermeasures. These include respiratory protection, whole body suits, hearing protection and heat stress, among many others...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{advances}} in the biomedical sciences have been accelerated by the uprising number of discoveries in genomics and molecular and cell biology which {{have led to the}} development of animal models of human diseases. The last improvements in instrumentation for medical imaging have enabled non-invasive investigations of biological processes in vivo, allowing longitudinal studies. Imaging systems are especially aimed to obtain high quality images of live animals. Small animal imaging techniques are essential to translational research in order to help in the early detection, diagnosis and treatment of diseases or pathological disorders. X-ray computed tomography (CT) images suffer from several artifacts that impair the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the images. This project is focus in one of the most common artifacts encountered in micro-CT which is produced by the physical phenomenon of beam hardening. This effect causes cupping in homogeneous objects, and dark streaks between denser parts within heterogeneous volumes. This project is part of a research line followed by the <b>Biomedical</b> Imaging and <b>Instrumentation</b> Group of the University Carlos III of Madrid and which takes place at the Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Gregorio Marañón. The work is devoted to research into medical imaging techniques for applications in preclinical research, and to design, develop and evaluate new acquisition systems, as well as to carry out different processing and reconstruction methodologies for multimodal images. The result of this project will be incorporated into a high-resolution, small animal X-ray tomograph (micro-CT) which was developed by the group and it is currently being both manufactured and commercialized worldwide by the Spanish company SEDECAL S. A. The general objective of this bachelor thesis is to incorporate and evaluate a complete scheme of beam hardening correction into the preclinical micro-CT scan developed by the laboratory research group. With the aim of fulfilling this objective, the beam hardening calibration method, as well as the linearization and post-processing correction methods are implemented into the multimodality workstation (MMWKS) console by using the programming language IDL. Afterwards, a beam hardening calibration phantom and a test phantom are designed. The stability of the BH calibration parameters is studied and the parameters for the second order are optimized. Finally, the evaluation of the system in real studies takes place. Ingeniería Telemátic...|$|R
