50|$|Indium {{tin oxide}} is harmful {{in that it}} may cause mild {{irritation}} in the respiratory tracts {{and should not be}} inhaled. If exposure is long-term, symptoms may become chronic and result in <b>benign</b> <b>pneumoconiosis.</b> Studies with animals indicate that indium tin oxide is toxic when ingested, along with negative effects on the kidney, lung, and heart.|$|E
40|$|Four men who mined barytes in Scotland and who {{developed}} pneumoconiosis are described. Three developed progressive massive fibrosis, from which two died; and one developed a nodular simple pneumoconiosis {{after leaving the}} industry. The radiological and pathological features of the men's lungs were those of silicosis and high proportions of quartz were found in two of them post mortem. The quartz was inhaled from rocks associated with the barytes in the mines. The features of silicosis in barium miners are contrasted with the <b>benign</b> <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> baritosis, that occurs in workers exposed to crushed and ground insoluble barium salts. Diagnostic difficulties arise when silicosis develops in workers mining minerals known to cause a separate and <b>benign</b> <b>pneumoconiosis.</b> These difficulties are compounded when, as not infrequently happens, the silicotic lesions develop or progress after exposure to quartz has ceased...|$|E
40|$|Rats, {{guinea pigs}} and monkeys were exposed by {{inhalation}} (6 hr/day, 5 days/week) {{for up to}} 22 months to a 13 mg/m 3 concentration of PVC dust. Autopsies on rats and guinea pigs were performed after 12 months of exposure and on monkeys after 22 months after 22 months of exposure. Lung function tests were performed on monkeys after 9, 14 and 22 months of exposure. Aggregates of alveolar macrophages containing PVC particles {{were found in the}} lungs of all animals. These aggregates were more numerous in the monkey lungs. No fibrosis or significant cellular infiltrates were present in or near these cellular aggregates. No significant effects on pulmonary function could be demonstrated in the monkeys exposed to PVC. Under the conditions of this experiment, inhaled PVC produced a <b>benign</b> <b>pneumoconiosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of selected tin compounds is reviewed. Over the years, {{a variety of}} uses has been found for organic and inorganic tin compounds, as fungicides, as stablizers in plastics, moluscicides, and miticides; they have also been suggested as insect chemosterilants and for other industrial uses. Many of these products are unpalatable when mixed into diets and have been suggested as rodent repellents. Inhaling tin as dust or fumes may cause a <b>benign</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> in exposed workers. The organotin compounds {{can be divided into}} alkyltin and aryltin compounds. The trimethyl and triethyltin compounds are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are the most toxic in this group. Triethyltin particularly produces status spongiosus of the white matter of the central nervous system. Most of the other alkyl and aryl tin compounds are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and are less toxic when given orally than when given parentally. Only one compound, tricyclohexyltin hydroxide, is now registered by the Environmental Protection Agency as a miticide. This product produces skin irritation in rabbits. Studies should be conducted to determine whether it causes contact dermatitis in humans...|$|E
