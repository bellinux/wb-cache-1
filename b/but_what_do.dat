500|$|Marcus Söderlund {{directed}} the accompanying music video for [...] "Silvia". It premiered exclusively on NME website in December 2009. A writer for Complex commented, [...] "The vid {{is kind of}} dramatic and hard to make sense of, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you expect from a band like this?" [...] The video plays out in a post-apocalyptic world. It begins with the band's three members waking up from sleeping {{in the middle of}} a street, appearing to be homeless. The men then walk way in the woods while shots of homeless people are interspersed. Several people are seen carrying torches in the woods and are soon joined by the band. They then set fire to a large wooden version of a jackalope and the video ends as it bursts into flames.|$|E
500|$|... "Toxic" [...] was {{performed}} by Spears at Britney Spears: In the Zone, a concert special that aired in ABC on November 17, 2003. She also performed [...] "Toxic" [...] as the headliner of the Jingle Ball on December 8, 2003, at Staples Center. It was the opening number of her set, and Spears appeared wearing a black top and a white fur cape. While the choreography was deemed as [...] "erotic", Corey Moss of MTV commented {{that some of the}} effect was lost due to Spears's lip synching and a stagehand fixing a prop during the song. On January 24, 2004, Spears opened the 2004 NRJ Music Awards with a performance of [...] "Toxic". During the ceremony, she also presented the NRJ Award of Honor for the Career to Madonna. Spears performed [...] "Toxic" [...] as the opening number of 2004's The Onyx Hotel Tour. Previous {{to the beginning of the}} tour, she deemed it as the song she was most excited to perform, along with [...] "Everytime". After an introduction in which she briefly appeared on a large video screen, Spears took the stage standing on top of a hotel bus, wearing a tight black catsuit. She was surrounded by dancers dressed as employees and columns of LED lighting, suggesting the façade of a glitzy hotel on the Vegas Strip. MTV UK commented, [...] "OK, so she doesn't so much sing than mime along with Toxic, [...] <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you expect when she's simultaneously performing a vigorous dance routine, ascending moving staircases and descending fireman poles?".|$|E
2500|$|Ben Dunn, who {{attended}} Catholic schools, read that article and was inspired. He states that [...] "Other superheroes, {{you never know}} what their faith is. Batman or Spider-Man or Superman, they do all these great things, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> they believe in?" [...] While not a true Christian comic book as its emphasis is not on directly calling readers to repentance or propagating the faith but on superheroes utilizing Christian imagery and on Christian-based speculative fiction, Warrior Nun Areala takes its idea very seriously.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2013, {{described}} by the Daily Post as a [...] "popular young leader" [...] on the Opposition benches, he strongly criticised {{what he saw as}} the Kilman government's lack of [...] "fiscal responsibility", with a lack of funding for decentralisation or for students' scholarships, while ministers and MPs still had their foreign travels funded. During a speech in Parliament criticising budget priorities, he mentioned Kilman's [...] "directive to the Public Service not to buy any new cars, and then they went and bought 25 million vatu worth of new vehicles. So who is the boss of the Public Service? Are you - the Prime Minister - not the boss?" [...] Highlighting the country's trade deficit, he added: “We see less exports and more imports. Since we joined the WTO, less exports and more imports. Local businesses are breaking down. We spend hundreds of millions of vatu in trade, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> we do with it? We talk about more development needed in the productive sector, but kill it off". He nonetheless noted the budget safeguards on spending on education and health, and voted in favour of the budget so as not to block necessary spending on public services.|$|E
