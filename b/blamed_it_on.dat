5|$|According to Ovid, Myrrha was the {{daughter}} of King Cinyras and Queen Cenchreis of Cyprus. It is stated that Cupid was not to blame for Myrrha's incestuous love for her father, Cinyras. Ovid further comments that hating one's father is a crime, but Myrrha's love was a greater crime. Ovid therefore <b>blamed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the Furies.|$|E

After conceiving the Ark's role in the series, Hoshino decided to write a song when Allen is {{rebuilding}} it through a piano. She requested help from her editor, a university graduate, but decided to use her own lyrics. She <b>blamed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> her own ego.|$|E

5|$|Batman & Robin was {{released}} on June 20, 1997 in North America, earning $42,872,605 in its opening weekend, making it the third-highest opening weekend of 1997. The film declined by 63% in its second week. Batman & Robin faced early competition with Face/Off and Hercules. Schumacher <b>blamed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> yellow journalism started by Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News and other film websites such as Dark Horizons. The film went on to gross $107.3 million in North America and $130.9 million internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $238.2 million. Warner Bros. acknowledged Batman & Robins shortcomings in the domestic market but pointed out success overseas.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond said that, {{during the}} time of {{shooting}} for the film, Spielberg got more ideas by watching movies every night which in turn extended the production schedule because he was continually adding new scenes to be filmed. Zsigmond previously turned down the chance to work on Jaws. In her 1991 book You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again, producer Julia Phillips wrote highly profane remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut, because she was fired during post-production due to a cocaine addiction. Phillips <b>blamed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> Spielberg being a perfectionist.|$|E
5|$|In November of {{that year}} the same group planted a bomb that blew out the front of Nussbaum's house, while {{he and his wife}} were {{sleeping}} there. Nussbaum blamed the bombings on local antisemitism and bigotry, but most of his congregation <b>blamed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> Nussbaum's anti-segregationist activism. Though the congregation officially supported him, a number of members privately urged him to leave Beth Israel and find another pulpit. The synagogue's board of trustees voted to prohibit non-Jewish groups from using the synagogue's premises unless they had prior approval from the board; the intent was to put an end to the interracial meetings that Nussbaum held there.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1230s, Ibn al-Ahmar {{had become}} the most {{powerful}} Muslim ruler in Iberia. He controlled the major cities of the south, including Granada, Almería, Malaga and Jaén. In the early 1240s, Ibn al-Ahmar came into conflict with his former allies, the Castilians, who were invading Muslim territories. Contemporary sources disagree about the cause of this hostility: The Christian First General Chronicle <b>blamed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> Muslim raiding, while Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun <b>blamed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> Christian invasions of Muslim territories. In 1242, Muslim forces successfully raided Andújar and Martos near Jaén. In 1244, Castile besieged and captured Ibn al-Ahmar's homeland of Arjona.|$|E

25|$|On 16 November 1996, in Kaspiysk (Dagestan), a bomb {{destroyed}} {{an apartment}} building housing Russian border guards; 68 people died.

Three people died on 23 April 1997, when a bomb exploded in the Russian railway station of Armavir (Krasnodar Krai), and two on 28 May 1997, when another bomb exploded in the Russian railway station of Pyatigorsk (Stavropol Krai).|$|E

25|$|Younis {{said he did}} {{not want}} to blame {{individuals}} but largely singled out players, particularly Afridi. He said Akmal should not have been selected, instead it should be players who are 'proud' to represent their country. He also said that the team lost the Asia cup in February 2016 because they were 'unfit' as they had not trained during PSL season and said it was like a 'holiday for them'. Overall, he <b>blamed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> poor captaincy from Afridi. He said it was unfair for him to first use Mohammad Nawaz, a new player, as a bowler in the Asia Cup 2016 because it 'destroyed' his confidence when he was unable to handle it after being hit for 38 runs in 3 overs. Younis later posted on his Twitter – 'no one wants to hear the truth'.|$|E
25|$|Diệm's {{denial of}} {{responsibility}} for the incidenthe <b>blamed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the communist Viet Congled to more discontent among the Buddhist majority. The incident spurred a protest movement against the religious discrimination of Diệm's Roman Catholic-dominated regime. The dispute {{came to be known as}} the Buddhist crisis, and it provoked widespread and large-scale civil disobedience. The objective of the protests was to have Decree Number 10 repealed, and to gain religious equality. However, the standoff persisted, and in August, the ARVN Special Forces of Colonel Lê Quang Tung, loyal to Diệm's brother and chief adviser Ngô Đình Nhu, raided temples across the country, killing an estimated hundreds and arresting thousands of Buddhist laypeople and monks. After this, the American government began to turn against Diệm and secretly encouraged a coup. On November 1, Diệm was deposed and he and Nhu were assassinated the next day.|$|E
25|$|On February 1, McCain won a 49–30% {{victory over}} Bush in the New Hampshire primary. Gary Bauer dropped out. After coming in third in Delaware Forbes dropped out, leaving three candidates. In the South Carolina primary, Bush soundly {{defeated}} McCain. Some McCain supporters <b>blamed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the Bush campaign, {{accusing them of}} mudslinging and dirty tricks, such as push polling that implied that McCain's adopted Bangladeshi-born daughter was an African-American child he fathered out of wedlock. While McCain's loss in South Carolina damaged his campaign, he won both Michigan and {{his home state of}} Arizona on February 22. The primary election that year also affected the South Carolina State House, when a controversy about the Confederate flag flying over the capitol dome prompted the state legislature to move the flag to a less prominent position at a Civil War memorial on the capitol grounds. Most GOP candidates said the issue should be left to South Carolina voters, though McCain later recanted and said the flag should be removed.|$|E

25|$|Although {{initially}} {{put off by}} Mrs Burton-Cox's attitude, Mrs Oliver {{decides to}} resolve the issue after consulting with Celia about her parents' death, and invites her friend Hercule Poirot to solve the disquieting puzzle. Together, they conduct interviews with several elderly witnesses associated with the case, whom they term “elephants”, based on the assumption that, like the proverbial elephants, they may have long memories. Each individual witness recalls a different set of circumstances, but Poirot notes two items of significance - the first being that Margaret Ravenscroft was seriously bitten by the otherwise devoted family dog a few days before her death, and that she had four wigs in her possession {{at the time of her}} death. Further investigation by himself and Mrs Oliver soon reveals that her maiden name was Preston-Grey, and that she had an identical twin sister called Dorothea. While Margaret led a fairly ordinary life, her sister spent protracted periods of her life in psychiatric nursing homes, after she was strongly suspected of being involved in two violent incidents: the first occurred in India when, following the death of her husband, Major Jarrow, Dorothea drowned their infant son and <b>blamed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> an Indian ayah; the second occurred in Malaya when she was with the Ravenscrofts, in which she attacked the child of a neighbor of theirs. She soon joined them at their home in Overcliffe, whereupon she apparently sleep-walked off a cliff one evening and died; the deaths of Alistair and Margaret occurred less than a month after this.|$|E

After the accident, Teller acted quickly to lobby in favor of nuclear energy, testifying to its safety and reliability, and soon after one flurry of activity suffered the attack.

[...] Although Fillmore worked to gain support among German-Americans, a major constituency, {{he was hurt}} among immigrants {{by the fact that}} New York City Whigs had supported a nativist candidate in the mayoral election earlier in 1844 Fillmore and his party were tarred with that brush.

After a small role in The Eagle and the Hawk, a war film starring Fredric March and Cary Grant, she starred in two melodramas: Brief Moment, which critics enjoyed, and White Woman, where she was paired with Charles Laughton.|$|E
