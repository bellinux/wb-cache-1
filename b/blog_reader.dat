40|$|There is an {{increasing}} number of people reading, writing, and commenting on blogs. According to a recent survey made by Technorati, there are about 75, 000 new blogs and 1. 2 million new posts everyday. However, it is difficult and time consuming for a <b>blog</b> <b>reader</b> to find the most interesting posts in the huge and dynamic blog world. In this article, an online Personalized <b>Blog</b> <b>Reader</b> (PBR) system is proposed, which facilitates blog readers in browsing the coolest and newest blog posts of their interests by automatically clustering the most relevant stories. PBR aims to make a user’s potential favorite topics always ranked higher than those nonfavorite ones. This is accomplished in the following steps. First, the system collects and provides a unified incremental index of posts coming from different blogs. Then, an incremental clustering algorithm with a flexible half-bounded window of observation is proposed to satisfy the requirements of online processing. It learns people’s personalized reading preferences to present a user with a final reading list. The experimental results show that the proposed incremental clustering algorithm is effective and efficient, and the personalization of the PBR performs well...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{advice and}} {{opinions}} given by consumers online {{have been proven}} {{to have a positive}} influence on consumers purchase intentions. It has previously been established by researchers that consumer-created information is more trustworthy compared to information provided by a seller. As a result, consumers’ eWOM has taken over the stage on the internet. Social media has in comparison to traditional media brought communication to a new level in terms of engaging consumers online. For instance, bloggers nowadays are assumed to be viewed as peers that can generates social ties between a blogger and a <b>blog</b> <b>reader</b> due to a blogger’s credibility. Thus, the power of peer communication is of relevance when considering persuasion in real life as well as online. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine how eWOM can be a powerful tool through social ties between the source and the receiver when it comes to generating consumers’ purchase intentions. The authors intend to contribute with an understanding of how different sociodemographic factors of homophily and source credibility can potentially have a direct or indirect influence on the persuasion process online. To understand the process of how consumers are persuaded through eWOM the authors examine the relationship between Swedish blog readers and Swedish bloggers and the process of how the readers are absorbing and using the bloggers’ message. Methodology & Method: This study was conducted using a qualitative methodology approach. The primary data was collected through interviews and observations. Ten interviews were implemented on the selected sample consisting of women living in Sweden, who are in the ages of 16 - 25 and read famous Swedish lifestyle blogs. Furthermore, the favourite blogs of the interviewees were observed by the researchers in order to complement the interviews. Conclusion: From this research the authors have found that homophily creates social ties between the <b>blog</b> <b>reader</b> and the blogger, and therefore this underpins that the likelihood of persuasion is higher if several factors of homophily exists. However, the factors of homophily are not sufficient on its own to establish a relationship between eWOM and purchase intentions. Rather, source credibility is considered to be the major factor that determines the extent of purchase intentions...|$|E

The present study utilized Pew Internet & American Life survey data from the November 2008 presidential election time period to investigate {{the degree to which}} political blog reading predicted online political discussion, online political participation, whether or not a person voted, and voting choice, over and above the predication that could be explained by demographic measures of age, education level, gender, income, marital status, race/ethnicity, and region. Ordinary least squares hierarchical regression revealed that political blog reading was positively and statistically significantly related to online political discussion and online political participation. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis indicated that the odds of a political <b>blog</b> <b>reader</b> voting were 1. 98 the odds of a nonreader voting, but vote choice was not predicted by reading political blogs. These results are interpreted within the uses and gratifications framework and the understanding that blogs add an interpersonal communication aspect to a mass medium. As more people use blogs {{and the nature of the}} blog-reading audience shifts, continuing to track and describe the blog audience with valid measures will be important for researchers and practitioners alike. Subsequent potential effects of political blog reading on engagement, discussion, and participation will be important to understand as these effects could impact the political landscape of this country and, therefore, the world...|$|E
40|$|Metamodernism {{has been}} characterised as a {{pendulum}} swing between poles of enthusiasm and irony, hope and melancholy, naïveté and knowingness, empathy and apathy, wholeness and fragmentation. (Vermeulen & Akker, 2010). Focusing {{on the work}} of three prolific personal fashion bloggers, themanrepeller (Leandra Medine), stylebubble (Susie Lau) and thestylerookie (Tavi Gevinson), within the context of metamodernism, this chapter will explore how the genre of personal fashion blogs are part of both the cause and potential solution to the characteristics of metamodernism. Boredom (with reference to Phillips definition of it being connected to ‘a wish for a desire’ (1993, 71)), reflecting the pace of web 2. 0, twenty-first century fashion production and the emotional response to the pendulum swings of metamodernism is explored as a motivating state (supported by enabling technology) that has facilitated the activity of frequent reinvention by young western personal fashion bloggers in terms of the identity they express in the public online domain. This demonstration of fluctuating and flexible identity is manifested in using social media to control and export self produced images that are constructed for the female rather than male gaze (Rocamora, 2011, 410). With reference to post feminism, the twenty-first century interactive media of the personal fashion blog reinforces a value system that prioritises qualities that are identified as feminine and preference a reciprocal relationship with the <b>blog</b> <b>reader.</b> KEYWORDS: Personal fashion blog, metamodernism, boredom, post feminism, social media. ...|$|E

We examine deliberation, polarization, and political participation among <b>blog</b> <b>readers.</b> We find that <b>blog</b> <b>readers</b> gravitate toward <b>blogs</b> that accord with their political beliefs. Few read blogs on {{both the left and}} right of the ideological spectrum. Furthermore, those who read left-wing blogs and those who read right-wing blogs are ideologically far apart. <b>Blog</b> <b>readers</b> are more polarized than either non-blog-readers or consumers of various television news programs, and roughly as polarized as US senators. <b>Blog</b> <b>readers</b> also participate more in politics than non-blog <b>readers.</b> <b>Readers</b> of <b>blogs</b> of different ideological dispositions do not participate less than those who read only blogs of one ideological disposition. Instead, readers of both left- and right-wing <b>blogs</b> and <b>readers</b> of exclusively leftwing blogs participate at similar levels, and both participate more than readers of exclusively right-wing blogs.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} of this thesis is to introduce the idea of brand blogging community. Brand blogging community is identified as an online brand community, where bloggers, brand representatives, and readers act together and commonly form a community that produces blog content. This thesis contributes to a research gap in brand community research, and aims to complement the research field by establishing a lacking definition for this specific type of brand community. The research defines what a brand blogging community is, what characteristics it has, for what purposes bloggers participate in them, and what drives reader affection towards them. The theoretical background for brand blogging community concept is grounded by consumer behavior, marketing, sociological research, and new media studies, and the analytical framework is mainly formed upon theories about brand communities, and value co-creation. Methodology: This research is carried out in a qualitative manner, and it is interpretative in nature. The research focuses on investigating two Scandinavian case communities; Lily. fi and Nouw. com. The research is carried out using netnographic research method, supported with four interviews with two bloggers, a <b>blog</b> <b>reader,</b> and a brand representative. Key Findings: This research finds out that brand blogging community is a multi-dimensional community that is constructed with brand elements, a technical web platform, social factors, and functional and personal motives of readers and bloggers. The basic characteristics for a brand blogging community are brand elements, communal spirit, and a content promoting website. Bloggers participate in brand blogging communities from social integration purposes, image purposes and because of a personal interest towards blogging in general, or the brand. For readers, brand blogging communities are attractive because they serve selected, relevant blog content, are linked with a recognizable brand, and have a detectable sprit. This research proves that brand blogging communities are specific type of brand communities, which create significant value for consumers and companies...|$|E

40|$|Utilizing {{social media}} in {{consumer}} brands’ marketing {{has been a}} rising trend during the last decade. Social media offers marketers new ways to connect with consumers and raise brand awareness, engagement and profitability. The large variety of different social media services gives brands {{the opportunity to be}} present in channels that fit their brand best. Along with the rise of social media, blogs have gained immense popularity among consumers. As bloggers have become social media personalities and gained significant audiences, marketers have also realized their potential. Marketers increasingly recruit bloggers into collaborations, as bloggers effectively reach consumer audiences and can have a real effect on their audience’s behavior. Blogs are a modern-day form of eWOM, where information is passed from one consumer to another. However, as bloggers increasingly enter into sponsored collaborations with marketers, the credibility of blog marketing has been questioned. Sponsorship enables bloggers to produce interesting content for their followers, but simultaneously it raises questions about the reliability of sponsored recommendations. This thesis aims at answering the question whether Finnish consumers perceive blog marketing as credible. The data was gathered with a survey that was sent out to Finnish <b>blog</b> <b>readers</b> through two lifestyle blog portals. The questionnaire received 230 responses, which were included in analysis. Results were generated quantitatively using exploratory factor analysis, t-tests and ANOVAs. Results show that blog marketing credibility in Finland is on a fairly good level, but room for improvement exists. The study contributes to existing knowledge of the state of blog marketing credibility from the consumers’ perspective in Finland. It generates knowledge of the demographic factors of Finnish lifestyle <b>blog</b> <b>readers</b> as well as brings insight into how Finnish lifestyle <b>blog</b> <b>readers</b> rate different aspects of credibility concerning bloggers and sponsored blog posts. It also suggests that consumers’ trust in blog marketing may vary depending on their use motivations and level of participation in blogs. Future research should venture deeper into how blog marketing credibility can be managed, how credibility affects purchase intentions and how potential audiences and bloggers can be better identified...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the study: Nowadays, {{with regards to the}} development of information technology and online communities, bloggers are seen to have a great impact on consumer decision making. While consumers generally perceive blogs as credible information sources and word of mouth is seen {{to be one of the}} most effective channels to influence consumer behaviour, the increasing commerciality of blogs has raised discussion about the credibility of blogs and bloggers. In addition, the electronic nature and lack of personal ties in online environment makes it difficult for consumers to evaluate the credibility of electronic word of mouth in blogs. Therefore, the {{objective of}} this study is to increase the understanding of eWOM credibility and effectiveness by studying the relationship between bloggers and readers and analysing how readers evaluate the credibility of bloggers and blog content. Methodology: The study is qualitative and interpretive in nature since the aim is to gain deeper understanding and identify meanings behind the blogger-reader relationships and blog credibility. The empirical data for the study was collected through 8 semi-structured consumer interviews focusing on young females who are active readers of fashion and lifestyle blogs. The interviews were recorded and transcribed and furthermore analysed based on the theoretical framework, which consisted of previous literature of blogs, eWOM and opinion leadership. Findings and Conclusions: The main findings of this research present that social aspects and perceived relationship are the main determinants of blogger credibility. <b>Blog</b> <b>readers</b> tend to evaluate the credibility of blogger and blog content through their previous reputation, which is ensured by building strong relationships that are based on the personality and privacy shared by the blogger. However, findings from this empirical research suggest that the relationship between blogger and reader is a complex entity since opposing to previous literature, <b>blog</b> <b>readers</b> do not actively communicate with the bloggers. In addition, the increasing commerciality in blogs has caused that <b>blog</b> <b>readers</b> nowadays consider more carefully the trustworthiness of blog postings by demanding integrity and transparency in order to evaluate the credibility of blogger and the content...|$|R
