5|$|Tanks must <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> {{from time}} to time for various reasons. One reason is to change the type of product carried inside a tank. Also, when tanks are to be {{inspected}} or maintenance must be performed within a tank, it must be not only cleaned, but made gas-free.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning up any spill {{immediately}} and thoroughly. Spills may <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> by sprinkling cat litter, sand or other absorbent material {{directly on the}} spill. Once fully absorbed, while wearing protective gloves, the material may be scooped into a plastic bag, sealed and disposed. The spill area may be scrubbed with a stiff brush and warm, soapy water. The soapy water is not recommended to be drained in a storm drain.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that deep fryers <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas. Oil vapors can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda can effectively clean affected surfaces.|$|E

5|$|Under the Act, {{regulations}} and rules came into force on 2 December 1802 {{and applied to}} all mills and factories employing three or more apprentices (unless the total workforce was less than twenty). It stated that all mills and factories should <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> at least twice yearly with quicklime and water; this included ceilings and walls. There was a requirement that the buildings have sufficient windows and openings for ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{element in}} a ring R is said to <b>be</b> <b>clean</b> (respectively unit-regular) {{if it is the}} sum (respectively product) of an {{idempotent}} element and an invertible element. If all elements in R are unit-regular, it is known that all elements in R <b>are</b> <b>clean.</b> In this note, we show that a single unit-regular element {{in a ring}} need not <b>be</b> <b>clean.</b> More generally, a criterion is given for a matrix (ab 00) to <b>be</b> <b>clean</b> in a matrix ring M 2 (K) over any commutative ring K.

The next step before a transfer is the pretransfer conference. The pretransfer conference covers issues such as what products will be moved, the order of movement, names and titles of key people, particulars of shipboard and shore equipment, critical states of the transfer, regulations in effect, emergency and spill-containment procedures, watch and shift arrangements, and shutdown procedures.|$|E

5|$|Water used in {{the steam}} cycle is taken from the local mains water, {{supplied}} by Northumbrian Water. Up to 300,000 tons of mains water per year is {{used in the}} station, however it has to <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> of impurities before use. This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This treated water is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.|$|E

5|$|Westchester's postwar {{development}} {{led to more}} stormwater runoff, {{which often}} flooded and closed the parkway. By 1958, engineers were urging that the river <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> up to reduce flooding. Still, illegal dumping and overflows continued. For example, storm runoff gave the Yonkers section the river's highest concentrations of heavy metals, PCBs, and other chemicals, {{according to a study}} of the river in 1983, the year the city stopped using the Saw Mill as its primary water source. A decade later, the sediment in the Saw Mill had the highest concentration of metals in the United States Geological Survey's entire water-quality assessment program.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel had to <b>be</b> <b>cleaned.</b> Unlike small caliber guns {{which can be}} field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} studios generally take numerous precautions {{to protect the}} health of the person being pierced and the piercer. Piercers are expected to sanitize the location to be pierced as well as their hands, even though they will often wear gloves during the procedure (and in some areas must, as it is prescribed by law). Quite frequently, these gloves will be changed multiple times, often one pair for each step of setup to avoid cross contamination. For example, after a piercer wearing gloves has cleaned the area to be pierced on a client, the piercer may change gloves to avoid recontaminating the area. Wearing sterile gloves is required by law for professional piercing procedures in some areas, such as the states of Florida and South Carolina. Tools and jewellery should be sterilized in autoclaves, and non-autoclavable surfaces should <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> with disinfectant agents on a regular basis and between clients.|$|E

5|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected externally for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations {{and excessive}} wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, corrosion damage, illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|E
5|$|The ice-cutting {{involved}} several {{stages and}} was typically {{carried out at}} night, when the ice was thickest. First the surface would <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> of snow with scrapers, {{the depth of the}} ice tested for suitability, then the surface would be marked out with cutters to produce the lines of the future ice blocks. The size of the blocks varied according to the destination, the largest being for the furthest locations, the smallest destined for the American east coast itself and being only 22inches (0.56 m) square. The blocks could finally be cut out of the ice and floated to the shore. The speed of the operation might depend on the likelihood of warmer weather impacting on the ice. In both New England and Norway, harvesting occurred during an otherwise quiet season, providing valuable local employment.|$|E
5|$|When {{the plant}} was started up for testing on {{schedule}} in November, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of}} the magnets and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December, Groves ordered a magnet broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to <b>be</b> <b>cleaned.</b> A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings. The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944; the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I became operational in April. The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944.|$|E

40|$|Let R be a {{commutative}} local ring. It is {{proved that}} R is Henselian if {{and only if}} each R-algebra which is a direct limit of module finite R-algebras <b>is</b> strongly <b>clean.</b> So, the matrix ring Mn(R) <b>is</b> strongly <b>clean</b> for each integer n> 0 if R is Henselian and we show that the converse holds if either the residue class field of R is algebraically closed or R is an integrally closed domain or R is a valuation ring. It is also shown that each R-algebra which is locally a direct limit of module-finite algebras, <b>is</b> strongly <b>clean</b> if R <b>is</b> a π-regular commutative ring. As in [10] a ring R <b>is</b> called <b>clean</b> if each element of R is the sum of an idempotent and a unit. In [8] Han and Nicholson proved that a ring R <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> {{if and only if}} Mn(R) <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> for every integer n ≥ 1. It is easy to check that each local ring <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> and consequently every matrix ring over a local ring <b>is</b> <b>clean.</b> On the other hand a ring R <b>is</b> called strongly <b>clean</b> if each element of R is the sum of an idempotent and a unit that commute. Recently, in [12], Chen and Wang gave an example of a commutative local ring R with M 2 (R) not strongly clean...|$|R

5|$|Coletti, Leal, Dillmann, Frijns, Ericsson, Rossi, Berthon, Binder, Giovesi, Haryanto, Rosenzweig and Abt {{were all}} {{trapped in the}} {{blockade}} {{with varying degrees of}} car damage. Nasr was near Bird and Ceccon and managed to avoid the collision between Leal and Palmer. Drivers ran back to their cars and remonstrated with marshals to enable them to take the restart. A forty-minute delay was necessitated to allow the track to <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> before the race could be restarted. Nine drivers had enough damage to warrant their retirement from the race: Cecotto, Leimer, Palmer, Leal, Frijns, Ericsson, Rossi, Berthon and Giovesi. The running order at the restart was determined by the order of the drivers that went through the first sector with the cars that did not enter being put in their starting position. This meant Evans led the field behind the safety car followed by Bird, Ceccon, Nasr and Calado. The safety car was withdrawn at the end of lap two and racing resumed with Evans leading Bird. Both drivers opened up a two-second advantage over Ceccon, Nasr, Calado and Richelmi. Although Evans had switched to the supersoft tyres during the stoppage Bird set consecutive fastest laps of the race on the soft tyres.|$|E
5|$|One 135-minute {{practice}} session {{was held on}} Friday morning before the Saturday afternoon race. Alex Tagliani was fastest in the session, {{which took place in}} dry, warm weather conditions, with a lap of 24.811 seconds; Tora Takagi was second, and da Matta third. Francitti was fourth-fastest, and Carpentier rounded out the session's top five drivers. Seven yellow caution flags were shown: the first two were for track inspections, the next two were for debris located in turns three and four. The fifth caution was for Shinji Nakano who stopped at the bottom of turns three and four with smoke billowing from his engine which dropped oil on the track that needed to <b>be</b> <b>cleaned.</b> The sixth was caused by Michel Jourdain Jr. when his engine failed and stopped between turns three and four and his car was extracted from the circuit, and the final was for Scott Dixon who slowed on the backstretch with a loss of engine power.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October 1943, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of the}} magnets, and had to be fastened more securely.
