5|$|The {{antelope}} is shy and elusive. When alarmed, {{it stands}} motionless and may nervously leap {{away from the}} danger or even sprint. It often conceals itself in tall grasses to escape predators. The use of alarm calls to alert others is not common because the antelope tries to avoid the attention of predators. However, in extreme cases, these calls {{may be used to}} warn predators that they have been identified. Adults mark vegetation in their territories with a colourless secretion of preorbital glands, that soon condenses to form a white film. They maintain multiple latrine sites where piles of their pellet droppings are formed by regular use. Latrine sites can be confused with those of the <b>barking</b> <b>deer</b> but the pellets are longer and larger in four-horned antelopes. Submissive display consists of shrinking the body, lowering the head and pulling the ears back. Predators of four-horned antelopes include tigers, leopards, and dholes.|$|E

40|$|In roe <b>deer,</b> <b>barking</b> is a loud call {{commonly}} {{given by}} {{males and females}} during inter- or intraspecific interactions. The analysis {{of a set of}} 19 spectral variables computed on 560 calls revealed significant variation between sexes, individuals, and probably age classes. Discriminant analysis predicted the sex of an individual with a 93. 5 % probability from {{a small portion of the}} bark frequency range. Among six males, a linear combination of six variables predicted the identity of the barking individual with a 70 % probability. These sexual and individual differences provide the potential for social recognition from vocalizations. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that <b>barking</b> in roe <b>deer</b> may allow remote signalling of presence, location and identity, and play an important role in the territorial system of this species...|$|R
