500|$|Journalist Jake Steelhammer {{believes}} the American urban myth of cow tipping {{originated in the}} 1970s. It [...] "stampeded into the '80s", he says, [...] "when movies like Tommy Boy and Heathers featured cow tipping expeditions." [...] Stories about cow tipping tend to be second-hand, he says, told by {{someone who does not}} claim to have tipped a cow <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> someone else who says he or she did.|$|E
500|$|In a January 2010 {{interview}} while {{promoting his}} biography I Am Ozzy, Osbourne stated {{that although he}} would not rule it out, he was doubtful {{there would be a}} reunion with all four original members of the band. Osbourne stated: [...] "I'm not gonna say I've written it out forever, but right now I don't think there's any chance. <b>But</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> what the future holds for me? If it's my destiny, fine." [...] In July, Butler said {{that there would be no}} reunion in 2011, as Osbourne was already committed to touring with his solo band. However, by that August they had already met up to rehearse together, and continued to do so through the autumn.|$|E
500|$|According to a December 2011 {{interview}} with Craig, [...] "We had the bare bones of a script {{and then there}} was a writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows?</b> There was me trying to rewrite scenes—and a writer I am not." [...] He said that he and Forster [...] "were the ones allowed to do it. The rules were that you couldn't employ anyone as a writer, but the actor and director could work on scenes together. We were stuffed. We got away with it, but only just. It was never meant to be as much of a sequel as it was, but it ended up being a sequel, starting where the last one finished." ...|$|E
5000|$|The English word [...] "placebo" [...] also denoted a sycophant; {{this use}} {{seems to have}} arisen among those {{otherwise}} unaware of the words’s origin <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> that the word is Latin for [...] "I will please".|$|R

500|$|As {{early as}} 1925, Nella Larsen {{had decided that}} she wanted to be among the [...] "New Negro" [...] writers {{receiving}} considerable attention at the time. Initially writing short stories that were sold early in 1926 to a ladies magazine, she was rumored that year to be writing a novel. In a letter to her friend, Carl Van Vechten, she acknowledges, [...] "it is the awful Truth. <b>But,</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> if I'll get through with the damned thing. Certainly not I." [...] In April 1927, Larsen and her husband, Elmer Imes, moved from Jersey City, New Jersey to Harlem to be closer to the cultural phenomenon. The following year, Larsen published her first novel Quicksand with New York-based publisher Knopf, and its favorable critical reception encouraged her ambitions to become known as a novelist.|$|E
500|$|Neal Purvis and Robert Wade {{returned}} as screenwriters and completed {{a draft of}} the script by April 2007; Paul Haggis also worked on the script, completing it two hours before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike officially began. Further work on the script had to be undertaken by Forster and Daniel Craig, who said later, [...] "We had the bare bones of a script {{and then there was a}} writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows?</b> There was me trying to rewrite scenes – and a writer I am not". Craig also admitted that the film was not initially meant to be a sequel, but it became one because of the re-writes undertaken by him and Forster. Haggis located his draft's climax in the Swiss Alps, but Forster wanted the action sequences to allude to the four classical elements of earth, water, air and fire. Michael G. Wilson decided on the film's title Quantum of Solace only [...] "a few days" [...] before its announcement on 24 January 2008. Forster hired Dennis Gassner as production designer, replacing Peter Lamont.|$|E
2500|$|Support for the Arab Peace Plan {{was also}} {{expressed}} by Andre Azoulay, a Jewish adviser to Moroccan King Mohammed VI. On October 28, 2008, Mr Azoulay {{said at a}} conference in Tel Aviv that: [...] "I am a Jew with a commitment," [...] said Andre Azoulay. [...] "I'm an Arab Jew. I advise the king of Morocco... The Arab mainstream sees Israel as the party responsible for preventing peace, not the Arabs.... is something that the Israelis hoped for ten years ago. <b>But</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> about it in Israel today? Who will take the initiative and explain it? The momentum will not last forever. This is a dangerous situation. Tomorrow something could happen in the West Bank and blow the whole deal, and we'll have to wait again." ...|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{say that}} I thought Mr. Horner {{a man of}} genius.

2500|$|Scott Miller {{chose to}} name his new band [...] "Game Theory" [...] as {{an allusion to}} the {{mathematical}} field of game theory, which he described as [...] "the study of calculating the most appropriate action given an adversary, ... someone who was thinking against you, {{and you had to}} organize what his moves could be, and what your moves should be, to give yourself the minimum amount of failure." [...] In a 1988 interview, Miller stated, [...] "It's a theory of probability that's a mathematical discipline that more or less has been applied improperly to real-life situations. It's just that idea of a set of rules that gets misused that intrigued me about it.... kind of a telling comment on life in general—that you just have {{to have some sort of}} set of rules, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> what the set of rules should be." [...] That theme, according to Miller, was what many Game Theory songs were about: [...] "Always be wary of the superstructure of whatever situation you're in. It may just be that the whole game that you're into is something very bogus and you should get out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1896 for G.W. Stauffer by Fred Harvey Seymour and later {{became known as the}} [...] "Graham Building". From 1896–1915 {{the first floor of the}} building housed a tavern while the second floor contained an apartment. On October 1, 1906 Jack and Nelle Reagan moved into the apartment above the tavern. The Reagans had two sons while they lived in the apartment. In 1908, [...] they had their first son, John Neil Reagan. Their second son, Ronald Wilson Reagan, was born on February 6, 1911 inside the second floor apartment. Family legend has it that when Jack first saw his ten-pound baby son, he said, “He looks like a fat little Dutchman. <b>But</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows,</b> he might grow up to be president some day.” [...] In a small town like Tampico in 1911, a new baby was such big news that four days after the birth the Tampico Tornado newspaper printed the rather unusual birth announcement that read, “February 10, 1911 [...] John REAGAN has been calling thirty-seven inches a yard and giving seventeen ounces for a pound this week at PITNEY’s store, he has been feeling so jubilant over the arrival of a ten pound boy Monday.” ...|$|E
