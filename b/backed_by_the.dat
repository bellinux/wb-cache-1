5|$|Henry III's younger brother, Richard of Cornwall, {{was granted}} the earldom in 1227. <b>Backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{revenues}} from the lucrative Cornish tin mining industry, he reconstructed the defences at the castle. Richard only visited Cornwall occasionally during his life, probably using Berkhampsted and Wallingford castles as his primary residences in England, and the work may {{have been designed to}} impress the Cornish nobility, with whom Richard had a difficult relationship.|$|E

5|$|Of the 14 men in {{contention}} for the Republican nomination, the three strongest candidates {{leading up to}} the convention were Ulysses S. Grant, James G. Blaine, and John Sherman. Grant had served two terms as President from 1869 to 1877, and was seeking an unprecedented third term in office. He was <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Stalwart faction of the Republican Party, which supported political machines and patronage. Blaine was a senator and former representative from Maine who was <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Half-Breed faction of the Republican Party. Sherman, the brother of Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman, was serving as Secretary of the Treasury under President Rutherford B. Hayes. A former senator from Ohio, he was backed by delegates who did not support the Stalwarts or Half-Breeds.|$|E

5|$|The 1974 Portuguese Carnation Revolution {{against the}} authoritarian Estado Novo {{returned}} Portugal to a multi-party system and facilitated {{the independence of}} the Portuguese colonies Angola and East Timor. In Africa, where Angolan rebels had waged a multi-faction independence war against Portuguese rule since 1961, a two-decade civil war replaced the anti-colonial struggle as fighting erupted between the communist People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Cubans and the Soviets, and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> United States, the People's Republic of China, and Mobutu's government in Zaire. The United States, the apartheid government of South Africa, and several other African governments also supported a third faction, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Without bothering to consult the Soviets in advance, the Cuban government sent a number of combat troops to fight alongside the MPLA. Foreign mercenaries and a South African armoured column were deployed to support UNITA, but the MPLA, bolstered by Cuban personnel and Soviet assistance, eventually gained the upper hand.|$|E

In 2012, the city council approved plans for a new $10 million library, but ballot measures <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> group Save Gladstone blocked the financing and construction pending specific voter approval.

5|$|Between 9:00pm and 10:00pm {{the guards}} enacted a {{strategy}} whereby the police officers, <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bayonets of the soldiers, {{advanced to the}} crowd and arrested each a man, who was then taken into the station, disarmed, and held there. The strategy was largely successful, and by 11:00pm {{the area around the}} station was mostly cleared, though sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the night. Between 165 and 200 were detained in total, and the most violent of the captives were removed and taken to the police station. The news reported that four, including one police officer, were injured in the exchange, and several who resisted arrest were beaten severely.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's {{first major}} {{achievement}} came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> local administration. The peasantry {{was forced to}} grow Indigo, a cash crop whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.|$|E

5|$|Henry II succeeded to {{the throne}} {{at the end of}} the Anarchy but during the revolt of 1173–74 he faced a {{significant}} uprising led by his son, Henry, <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> French crown. The conflict spread across England and Kenilworth was garrisoned by Henry II's forces; Geoffrey II de Clinton died in this period and the castle was taken fully into royal possession, a sign of its military importance. The Clintons themselves moved on to Buckinghamshire. By this point Kenilworth Castle consisted of the great keep, the inner bailey wall, a basic causeway across the smaller lake that preceded the creation of the Great Mere, and the local chase for hunting.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of a band of Latin American revolutionaries was also influenced by the French leftist activist Régis Debray's accounts of his time spent fighting in the Bolivian Andes alongside the Argentine Marxist–Leninist revolutionary Che Guevara. Hergé's {{depiction of}} Bordurian support for Tapioca's government was {{a reference to the}} Soviet Union's support for various Latin American regimes, most notably that of Castro's Cuba, with San Theodoros being depicted as having been governed under the ideological system of Borduria's political leader, Kurvi-Tasch. Similarly, Hergé included a reference to Alcazar being <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> International Banana Company in order to reflect the influence of Western multinational corporations in Latin America.|$|E
5|$|In {{identifying}} the remains {{as those of}} Palaeoscincus, Broom initially classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> research of Coombs in the 1970s. However, in 1929, Nopcsa identified the taxon as a stegosaurid, with which most modern studies agree. In 1981, the genus was reviewed with modern taxonomy, and {{found to be a}} valid genus of stegosaurid. However, a more recent 2008 review of Stegosauria could only identify one distinguishing feature, and while that study still referred it to Stegosauridae based on similarity, no diagnostic features of the family could be identified in Paranthodon.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the retreat from Winchester, Matilda rebuilt her court at Devizes Castle, a former property of the Bishop of Salisbury that had been confiscated by Stephen. She established her household knights on the surrounding estates, supported by Flemish mercenaries, ruling through the network of local sheriffs and other officials. Many of those that had lost lands in the regions held by the King travelled west to take up patronage from Matilda. <b>Backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pragmatic Robert of Gloucester, Matilda was content to engage in a drawn-out struggle, and the war soon entered a stalemate.|$|E
5|$|Snetkov {{joined the}} Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1945 {{and was a}} deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union at its tenth and {{eleventh}} convocations, which lasted from 1979 to 1989. He was also a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party between 1986 and 1990. During the March 1989 Soviet Union legislative election, the first relatively free Soviet elections, Snetkov, who was <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Communist Party, lost his seat, which represented a district in Yaroslavl, to reformist Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Podziruk, in a campaign focused {{on the issue of}} the existence of the Soviet draft.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Redding's departure, Hendrix began lodging at the eight-bedroom Ashokan House, in {{the hamlet}} of Boiceville near Woodstock in upstate New York, {{where he had}} spent some time vacationing in mid-1969.

During this time, Mitchell was unavailable for commitments made by Jeffery, which included Hendrix's first appearance on U.S. TV—on The Dick Cavett Show—where he was <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> studio orchestra, and an appearance on The Tonight Show where he appeared with Cox and session drummer Ed Shaughnessy.|$|E
