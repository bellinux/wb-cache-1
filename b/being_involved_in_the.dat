5|$|After the crash, both Crossair and CCP, {{including}} the pilots {{who had previously}} spoken {{to the media and}} been fired, publicly stated that the coincidence between the accident and the dispute was very unfortunate and that reports about pilot error <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crash were speculation, although this conclusion was later established to be the probable cause of the accident.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Sylvester also reached tabloid {{headlines}} {{after he}} was arrested {{on a visit to}} New York City, accused of <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> robbery of several rare coins. After three days of incarceration, he was released on a police bail of $30,000. Sylvester was never charged, and police later admitted their mistake after it was revealed that the real culprit had posed as Sylvester by signing cheques in his name.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the rebellion Henry le Despenser appointed John Derlington, the archdeacon of Norwich, as his vicar-general on 5 February 1400 and then submitted himself to the custody of Archbishop Arundel who accompanied him to Parliament on 20 January 1401. There his enemy Sir Thomas Erpingham falsely accused him of <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plot.

5|$|Persistent {{attempts}} by the Israeli government to identify another Palestinian leader to represent the Palestinian people failed. Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him. Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, but Israel had him arrested for allegedly <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> killing of twenty-six civilians, and {{he was sentenced to}} five life terms.|$|E

5|$|After {{an attempt}} on Paul Robinson's (Stefan Dennis) life, Mark is {{introduced}} {{as the lead}} detective in the case. When he received conflicting information from the suspects he interviews, Mark struggled to identify the culprit. McGregor told a writer from SX News that he enjoyed <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storyline, as he had never had that much responsibility before. To prepare for the role, McGregor chose to research his character's job. Mark was described as being handsome, charming and a perfectionist. He was dedicated to {{his job as a}} police detective and often put his work ahead of everything else. As a consequence, Mark struggled to balance his work and personal lives. McGregor stated that he shared some similarities with Mark and he enjoyed getting into character.|$|E

5|$|The ship {{hunted for}} German {{commerce}} raiders {{until she was}} transferred to the Grand Fleet at the end of 1914. She was assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron upon her return home. She {{was transferred to the}} 2nd Cruiser Squadron in 1916 and was present at the Battle of Jutland. Several days later she was sailing to Russia, carrying the Secretary of State for War, Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, when she is believed to have struck a mine laid by a German submarine. She sank with heavy loss of life, including Kitchener and his staff. Rumours later circulated of German spies and sabotage <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sinking. Her wreck is listed under the Protection of Military Remains Act, though part was later illegally salvaged. Several films have been made exploring the circumstances of her loss.|$|E
5|$|During his investigations, {{the protagonist}} and Rei learn of {{multiple}} demon-run criminal organizations causing chaos in Hirasaki including factions of the Yakuza, {{all of them}} connected to Davis. The protagonist's efforts against the demon threats are hindered by Hideo Momochi, who accuses the pair of <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> incidents until the police station is infested by demons and the police chief is revealed to be a demon in disguise. The protagonist also foils an attempt to Kumiko for unknown reasons. After taking down {{each of the five}} major demon factions, Davis reveals that the entire affair was orchestrated to break five seals holding prisoner the spirit of Inaruna: once a powerful regional priestess who was executed for resisting the forces of Emperor Jimmu with her magical powers during the unification of Japan, her spirit's hatred for her conquerors has grown beyond control and she will destroy the city if released. Kumiko, the reincarnation of Inaruna, is successfully abducted by Davis and used as a host for Inaruna's spirit. Although she is summoned, the protagonist and Rei rescue Kumiko and kill Davis. They then successfully defeat Inaruna. With the city returned to normal, the protagonist remains trapped in Kuzunoha's body, and can choose either to use his own name or adopt the Kuzunoha title.|$|E
50|$|At present, he is {{involved}} as legal counsel in numerous high-profile cases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regional trial courts, the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, apart <b>being</b> actively <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> good governance and anti-corruption movement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|R

5|$|Events {{come to a}} {{head when}} Ryotaro Dojima mistakenly accuses the protagonist of <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> murders. Nanako is kidnapped during the protagonist's interrogation, leading Ryotaro {{to engage in a}} {{vehicular}} pursuit with the culprit. The chase ends as they both crash; the kidnapper escapes with Nanako through a television set in his truck, and the gravely-injured Ryotaro entrusts her rescue to the group. The group tracks them down within the TV world; the culprit, Taro Namatame, becomes a god-like monster—Kunino-sagiri—which attacks them but is defeated, and both he and Nanako are taken to the Inaba hospital. When Nanako appears to die, the group furiously confronts Namatame; as the protagonist, the player must help the others realize that Namatame is not the killer by pointing out the lack of a proper motive, and subsequently work to determine that Ryotaro's assistant, Tohru Adachi, is the true killer. Failure to do so ends the game with the party unable to solve the case; Nanako either remaining dead, or reviving but remaining hospitalised; and the recurring fog permanently setting in, the last of which will eventually lead to humanity's demise.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Lundgren starred {{opposite}} Kristian Alfonso and George Segal in Joshua Tree, {{directed by}} Academy Award and BAFTA-winning stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong. Lundgren plays Wellman Anthony Santee, a former racecar driver who {{has turned to}} hauling exotic stolen cars with his friend Eddie Turner (Ken Foree). One day he is framed by police officer Frank Severance (Segal) {{for the murder of}} a highway patrolman, also killing his friend Eddie. Santee is sent to prison after recovering in a prison hospital, but escapes during transfer and takes a female hostage named Rita Marrick (Alfonso) at a gas station, not suspecting that she's a cop. On the run from the law, involving exotic cars and desert scenery, Santee must prove his innocence and prove Severance guilty of <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car ring and for murder. Much of the film was filmed in the Alabama Hills of the Sierra Nevada and the desert of the Joshua Tree National Park of southeast California.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{had been}} educated in a {{sequence}} of convents, however, and may well have taken the vows to formally become a nun, which formed an obstacle to the marriage progressing. She {{did not wish to}} be a nun and appealed to Anselm for permission to marry Henry, and the Archbishop established a council at Lambeth Palace to judge the issue. Despite some dissenting voices, the council concluded that although Matilda had lived in a convent, she had not actually become a nun and was therefore free to marry, a judgement that Anselm then affirmed, allowing the marriage to proceed. Matilda proved an effective queen for Henry, acting as a regent in England on occasion, addressing and presiding over councils, and extensively supporting the arts. The couple soon had two children, Matilda, born in 1102, and William Adelin, born in 1103; it is possible that they also had a second son, Richard, who died young. Following the birth of these children, Matilda preferred to remain based in Westminster while Henry travelled across England and Normandy, either for religious reasons or because she enjoyed <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> machinery of royal governance.|$|E

5|$|Rising electoral {{success was}} {{accompanied}} by factional in-fighting, with a leadership contest emerging in the ASP between the incumbent Alejo Véliz and Morales, who had the electoral backing of the social movement's bases. The conflict led to a schism, with Morales and his supporters splitting to form their own party, the Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (Instrumento Político por la Soberanía de los Pueblos – IPSP). The movement's bases defected en masse to the IPSP, leaving the ASP to crumble and Véliz to join the centre-right New Republican Force (Nueva Fuerza Republicana – NFR), for which Morales denounced him as a traitor to the cocalero cause. Continuing his activism, in 1998 Morales led another cocalero march from El Chapare to la Paz, and came under increasing criticism from the government, who repeatedly accused him of <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cocaine trade and mocked him for how he spoke and his lack of education.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, 14 November, the {{regiment}} crossed the River Rubin, and at 12:30 located a Turkish position at Ayun Kara. The regiment {{was on the}} left front of the brigade advance, with the Wellington Mounted Rifles on their left and the Aucklanders in reserve. As {{the regiment}} advanced through orange groves, they were engaged by the Turkish defenders. The regiment then held a fire support position while the other two regiments attacked on the left. Fighting off several counter-attacks the brigade eventually, at nightfall, won the battle and held their ground overnight. Not <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main assault, the regiment's casualties were rather light at one dead and six wounded. The next day the Turkish force had withdrawn, and the regiment advanced first to Beit Dejan, and then occupied the port of Jaffa on 17 November, where the commanding officer established the regimental headquarters in the German Consulate.|$|E
5|$|Minutes {{before the}} race start, reports of rain falling on the track caused the start to be delayed by around ten minutes. Race control {{eventually}} deemed the race to be dry enough {{to be called a}} dry race, thus the rain tyres were not necessary, but would be required later in the race. Dario Franchitti and Alex Tagliani led the field to the line, with the circuit still being dusty from the previous night's repair work. Dust clouds engulfed the start-finish straight, blinding many of the midfield runners. The top five runners managed to negotiate the first chicane cleanly, while behind, half a dozen cars were involved in a first-corner crash. Takuma Sato misjudged his braking into the first corner and clipped the rear of Will Power's Penske machine, which spun him into Scott Dixon. Hélio Castroneves could not avoid running into Dixon's stationary car at the first corner. After many drivers went down the escape road to avoid <b>being</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crash, a separate accident took place between Marco Andretti and Mario Moraes. Moraes lost control of his KV Racing Technology car behind Ana Beatriz, hit Andretti and became airborne before coming to rest across the cockpit of Andretti's car. It took several minutes to extricate Andretti from his damaged machinery, but was uninjured and very critical of Moraes' driving. The crash resulted in a seven-lap caution period, and eliminated Sato, Moraes and Andretti from the race. Dixon and Castroneves both recovered to the pit lane to repair damage.|$|E
