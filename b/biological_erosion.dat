40|$|Biological {{production}} of calcium carbonate {{in the oceans}} is an important process. Although carbonate is produced in the open ocean (pelagic, see Chapter 5), this chapter concentrates on production in coastal waters (neritic) because this contributes sediment to the coast through skeletal breakdown producing sand and gravel deposits on beaches, across continental shelves, and within reefs. Marine organisms with hard body parts precipitate calcium carbonate as the minerals calcite or aragonite. Corals, molluscs, foraminifera, bryozoans, red algae (for example the algal rims that characterize reef crests on Indo-Pacific reefs) are particularly productive, {{as well as some}} species of green algae (especially Halimeda). Upon death, these calcareous organisms break down by physical, chemical, and <b>biological</b> <b>erosion</b> processes through a series of discrete sediment sizes (Perry et al., 2011). Neritic carbonate production has been estimated to be approximately 2. 5 Gt year- 1 (Milliman and Droxler, 1995; Heap et al., 2009). The greatest contributors are coral reefs that form complex structures covering a total area of more than 250, 000 km 2 (Spalding and Grenfell, 1997; Vecsei, 2004), but other organisms, such as oysters, may also form smaller reef structures...|$|E

40|$|Attempts to {{understand}} the morphodynamics of rock coasts focus on the nature and rate of erosion and how this influences the evolution of coastal profiles over century to millennial timescales. Biological contributions to this process are often ignored or treated in a rather simplistic way as merely producing microscale decreases in rock strength. Using a combination of field observations and literature review, we address two key issues hampering a more rounded assessment of <b>biological</b> impacts <b>erosion</b> of coastal rocks. Firstly, we reconceptualise the <b>biological</b> contributions to <b>erosion</b> of rock coasts into direct and facilitative types, and secondly we discuss {{the need for more}} appropriate reporting of rates of bioerosion. For direct bioerosion, this means clearly documenting the percentage of platform surfaces affected by bioerosive agents and quantifying the volume of material eroded and the amount of fine sediment produced. For facilitative bioerosion, we must quantify the roles of biota in changing the material properties of rocks, creating or altering surface morphologies and/or weakening joint boundaries. In this way, facilitative bioerosion is one of several processes mediating geomorphic alteration of rock surfaces, contributing to the production of landforms and/or reducing the resisting force of rock. Subsequently, we build on these ideas to produce a new conceptual model which more accurately portrays the multiple and cross-scalar ways that biological processes, notably bioerosion, influence the resistance of coastal rocks to erosive forces. Such a model provides a stronger basis for numerical modelling and understanding the morphodynamics of rock coasts in the future and allows a quantitative assessment of the role of biota...|$|R

Many measures of pH and Alcali nit y had been done but no diurnal cycle had been observed. It seems impossible to generalize EMERY's results to anon-tidal sea as West Mediterranean sea.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{importance}} of bio-erosion {{in the destruction of}} coastal limestones of the tropical island of Barbados. A stereophotogrammetric system capable of obtaining yearly photographs of the rock surface and of providing quantitative data on rock surface data points from which erosional values can be obtained is described. Results of photogrammetric analysis of five study localities show a range of erosion rates (for intertidal and supratidal localities) which vary from 1. 2 mm. /year to 2. 4 mm. /year. Following establishment of erosion rates for the localities studied, calculations have been carried out to determine the erosional capabilities of the epilithophagic organisms present on the rock surfaces. These calculations show that in no case do epilithophagic organisms account for more than 40 per cent of the total erosion. Other factors which may account for the remaining erosion include physical and chemical weathering as well as non-epilithophagic <b>biological</b> <b>erosion.</b> The author suggests that of the latter category the erosional effects of boring microphytes (chasmolithic and endolithic algae and fungi) are extremely important in explaining the non-epilithophagic erosion.

40|$|Most of {{that loss}} {{is due to}} storms, crown-of-thorns starsh, and {{bleaching}} due to extended periods of increased summer sea temperature. However other factors are also contributing {{to the ability of}} the Reef to respond to and recover from these impacts. Ocean acidity has the potential to slow growth of coral and is likely to have a larger impact in the coming decades. About half of the extra carbon dioxide (CO 2) that humankind is injecting into the atmosphere is being absorbed by the oceans. This anthropogenic CO 2 is increasing the acidity of the oceans. What aect is this having today? What will be the impact on the Reef in coming decades? And how does it aect the Reef’s capacity for repair? Coral growth is slowing on the Reef and around the world We know this from studies of long coral core records. Coral growth can be measured by coral calcication—the speed at which their calcium carbonate skeleton is deposited. Sustained calcication is essential for coral recovery, and for repair to the Reef after physical erosion (such as from storms) and <b>biological</b> <b>erosion.</b> The decline in coral calcication between 1990 and 2005 is unprecedented in at least the past 400 years.

Contrary to previous thinking, it is becoming clear that women know most about these plants because, throughout history, women’s daily work has required more of this knowledge. This paper describes how women predominate in plant biodiversity management in their roles as housewives, plant gatherers, homegardeners, herbalists, seed custodians and informal plant breeders. But they are largely invisible to outsiders and are easily undervalued.

Steps needed include: prioritising the conservation of plants that are important to women curators and reversing dynamics that lead to their erosion; recognising, and promoting the inter-generational transmission of women’s traditional knowledge; recognising indigenous rights systems and women’s rights to plants and land resources within these; and ensuring women’s full participation in decisions and policies that affect their plant rights...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExperiments have {{demonstrated}} that ocean acidification (OA) conditions projected to occur {{by the end of}} the century will slow the calcification of numerous coral species and accelerate the <b>biological</b> <b>erosion</b> of reef habitats (bioerosion). Microborers, which bore holes less than 100 μm diameter, are one of the most pervasive agents of bioerosion and are present throughout all calcium carbonate substrates within the reef environment. The response of diverse reef functional groups to OA is known from real-world ecosystems, but to date our understanding of the relationship between ocean pH and carbonate dissolution by microborers is limited to controlled laboratory experiments. Here we examine the settlement of microborers to pure mineral calcium carbonate substrates (calcite) along a natural pH gradient at a volcanically acidified reef at Maug, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). Colonization of pioneer microborers was higher in the lower pH waters near the vent field. Depth of microborer penetration was highly variable both among and within sites (4. 2 – 195. 5 μm) over the short duration of the study (3 mo.) and no clear relationship to increasing CO 2 was observed. Calculated rates of biogenic dissolution, however, were highest at the two sites closer to the vent and were not significantly different from each other. These data represent the first evidence of OA-enhancement of microboring flora colonization in newly available substrates and provide further evidence that microborers, especially bioeroding chlorophytes, respond positively to low pH. The accelerated breakdown and dissolution of reef framework structures with OA will likely lead to declines in structural complexity and integrity, as well as possible loss of essential habitat...|$|E

Experimental studies showed that bioerosion is subject to distinct temporal variability, but previous long-term studies were restricted to tropical waters. Here, we present results from a 14 -year bioerosion experiment that was carried out along the rocky limestone coast of the island of Rhodes, Greece, in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, in order to monitor the pace at which bioerosion affects carbonate substrate and the sequence of colonisation by bioeroding organisms. Internal macrobioerosion was visualised and quantified by micro-computed tomography and computer-algorithm-based segmentation procedures. Analysis of internal macrobioerosion traces revealed a dominance of bioeroding sponges producing eight types of characteristic Entobia cavity networks, which were matched to five different clionaid sponges by spicule identification in extracted tissue. The morphology of the entobians strongly varied depending on the species of the producing sponge, its ontogenetic stage, available space, and competition by other bioeroders. An early community developed during the first 5 years of exposure with initially very low macrobioerosion rates and was followed by an intermediate stage when sponges formed large and more diverse entobians and bioerosion rates increased. After 14 years, 30  % of the block volumes were occupied by boring sponges, yielding maximum bioerosion rates of 900  g m − 2  yr − 1. A high spatial variability in macrobioerosion prohibited clear conclusions about the onset of macrobioerosion equilibrium conditions. This highlights the necessity of even longer experimental exposures and higher replication at various factor levels in order to better understand and quantify temporal patterns of macrobioerosion in marine carbonate environments...|$|E

We carried out our work in the Mediterranean sea, which has narrow tidal ranges and low-intensity sea storms if compared to other seas, and where the study of tidal notches has been extensively reported in literature. We surveyed 73 coastal sites in Italy, France, Croatia, Montenegro, Greece, Malta and Spain, and we report observations made on tidal notches worldwide. At each site, we measured notch width and depth, {{the characteristics of the}} biological rim {{at the base of the}} notch, and we correlated these parameters with wave energy, tide gauge data and rock lithology.

40|$|One {{striking}} {{feature of}} coral reef ecosystems is the complex benthic architecture which supports diverse and abundant fauna, particularly of reef fish. Reef-building corals are in decline worldwide, with a corresponding loss of live coral cover {{resulting in a}} loss of architectural complexity. Understanding the dynamics of the reef architecture is therefore important to envision the ability of corals to maintain functional habitats in an era of climate change. Here, we develop a mechanistic model of reef topographical complexity for contemporary Caribbean reefs. The model describes the dynamics of corals and other benthic taxa under climate-driven disturbances (hurricanes and coral bleaching). Corals have a simplified shape with explicit diameter and height, allowing species-specific calculation of their colony surface and volume. Growth and the mechanical (hurricanes) and <b>biological</b> <b>erosion</b> (parrotfish) of carbonate skeletons are important in driving the pace of extension/reduction in the upper reef surface, the net outcome being quantified by a simple surface roughness index (reef rugosity). The model accurately simulated the decadal changes of coral cover observed in Cozumel (Mexico) between 1984 and 2008, and provided a realistic hindcast of coral colony-scale (1 - 10 m) changing rugosity over the same period. We then projected future changes of Caribbean reef rugosity in response to global warming. Under severe and frequent thermal stress, the model predicted a dramatic loss of rugosity over {{the next two or three}} decades. Critically, reefs with managed parrotfish populations were able to delay the general loss of architectural complexity, as the benefits of grazing in maintaining living coral outweighed the bioerosion of dead coral skeletons. Overall, this model provides the first explicit projections of reef rugosity in a warming climate, and highlights the need of combining local (protecting and restoring high grazing) to global (mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions) interventions for the persistence of functional reef habitats...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{contribute}} to a reliable, easy-to-handle and economically viable erosion risk assessment of contaminated riverine sites, the present study aims to implement master-variables best characterising the sediment stability. Thus, a wide range of sediment properties was related to the critical shear stress for mass erosion, determined in the SETEG (Stroemungskanal zur Ermittlung der tiefenabhaengigen Erosionsstabilitaet von Gewaessersedimenten) pressurised channel, with special emphasis on vertical and temporal gradients in the Lauffen reservoir on the River Neckar. Over the course of 1 year, positive impacts of some macrofauna species and benthic diatoms on the sediment stability were detected for the sediment surface (0. 5 cm). However, a high seasonal variability of biological parameters caused varying relations with erosion resistance in the upper sediment layers as shown for the colloidal carbohydrates. Considering only deeper sediment layers (5 – 35 cm), a more general pattern could be revealed with correlations between the critical shear stress and single sediment properties such as depth, grain size, total organic carbon (TOC), cation exchange coefficient (CEC), carbohydrates and proteins. Firstly, the influence of physico-chemical and <b>biological</b> properties on <b>erosion</b> resistance became evident, even over depths at 0 – 35 cm. Secondly, inter-particle forces are most important for erosion resistance. These are enhanced in fine-grained sediment layers, offering high binding capacities but also strengthened by polymeric substances permeating the void space and coating particles. These covariance patterns of sedimentological and biological parameters are addressed by multivariate statistical tests (principal component analysis), resulting in a higher magnitude of the correlation coefficient between critical shear stress and the master-variables in main component II (polymeric substances, grain size, TOC, CEC; R= 0. 77) compared to single correlations...|$|R
40|$|Coral reefs {{are declining}} {{worldwide}} {{as a result}} of many anthropogenic disturbances. This trend is alarming because coral reefs are hotspots of marine biodiversity and considered the ‘rainforests of the sea. As in the rainforest, much of the diversity on a coral reef is cryptic, remaining hidden among the cracks and crevices of structural taxa. Although the cryptofauna make up the majority of a reef’s metazoan biodiversity, we know little about their basic ecology or how these communities respond to reef degradation. Emerging research shows that the species richness of the motile cryptofauna is higher among dead (framework) vs. live coral substrates and, surprisingly, increases within successively more eroded reef framework structures, ultimately reaching a maximum in dead coral rubble. Consequently, the paradigm that abundant live coral is the apex of reef diversity needs to be clarified. This provides guarded optimism amidst alarming reports of declines in live coral cover and the impending doom of coral reefs, as motile cryptic biodiversity should persist independent of live coral cover. Granted, the maintenance of this high species richness is contingent on the presence of reef rubble, which will eventually be lost due to physical, chemical, and <b>biological</b> <b>erosion</b> if not replenished by live coral calcification and mortality. The trophic potential of a reef, as inferred from the abundance of cryptic organisms, is highest on live coral. Among dead framework substrates, however, the density of cryptofauna reaches a peak at intermediate levels of degradation. In summary, the response of the motile cryptofauna, and thus a large fraction of the reef’s biodiversity, to reef degradation is more complex and nuanced than currently thought; such that species richness may be less sensitive than overall trophic function...|$|E

Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a main component of Brazilian agriculture, and enhancement of yields has been achieved under NT {{as a result of}} mitigation of environmental stresses, resulting in higher N 2 fixation. However, the effects of NT on rhizobial diversity are poorly understood. This study evaluated rhizobial diversity in soils planted to common bean under NT or conventional tillage (CT) systems that were compared with natural grassland used for grazing, in the State of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. Genetic diversity was assessed by the amplification of the DNA by PCR with specific primers (BOX-PCR) and by RFLP-PCR analyses of the 16 S rDNA region. A high level of diversity was observed among strains from all three systems, such that the similarity in the clustering analysis of BOX-PCR products ranged from 36 % under natural grassland to only 23 % for CT strains. High polymorphism was confirmed in the RFLP-PCR analysis; forty-seven different profiles were obtained, none sharing high similarity with the profiles of reference species of common bean rhizobia. These results indicate that other tropical rhizobial species remain to be described. Genetic diversity was higher among the NT than the CT rhizobial strains, especially when the RFLP-PCR profiles were considered. Genetic diversity in the natural grassland was lower than in the cropped systems, possibly due to absence of the host plant and stubble burning in winter. Average yields in the area under NT (e. g. common bean, approximately 1500 kg ha¿ 1) have been about 30 % higher than under CT, therefore high rhizobial diversity may be a parameter indicative of superior soil quality...|$|E
40|$|Coral reefs {{worldwide}} {{are suffering}} degradation from increasing fishing pressure, pollution, diseases, and coral bleaching. One important ecological consequence of such degradation {{is an increase}} in <b>biological</b> <b>erosion,</b> or bioerosion, of the coral framework by boring and grazing organisms. Therefore, it has become essential to understand the factors that control the processes and agents of bioerosion. The aim of my dissertation is to understand how organic and inorganic nutrients and herbivory affect the bioerosion of carbonate substrates by microbial endolithic organisms (bacteria, fungi and algae), an often overlooked component of bioerosion processes in coral reefs. Results of controlled experiments using herbivore-exclusion cages and fertilizers at Glovers Reef, Belize consistently showed significant effect of nutrients in stimulating microbial endoliths' substrate colonization and bioerosion rates of Strombus gigas shells. The addition of inorganic nutrients increased bioerosion rates by a factor of 8 to 15 in comparison to control treatments. Changes in nutrient ratios changed microbial endolithic community structure. The addition of nitrogen alone or in combination with phosphorus stimulated green algae, the addition of phosphorus alone stimulated cyanobacteria, and the addition of organic matter alone stimulated fungi. The inclusion of herbivores reduced observed bioerosion rates by half, demonstrating the importance of herbivory in modifying bioerosion processes. Field experiments on the relationship between water quality and the amount of microbioerosion in Lambis chiragra shells in nine coral reefs in East Africa demonstrated that other factors within reefs may interact with nutrients in determining bioerosion rates. Results suggested that epilithic algal cover, particularly crustose coralline algae, may decrease microborer colonization and bioerosion rates by reducing light conditions within substrates, so that no direct effects of nutrients on bioerosion rates are detected. A critical review of the evidence for nutrients as a primary control of bioerosion by different bioeroder groups (microborers, macroborers, and grazers) suggests that macroborer abundances reflect increases in nutrient conditions and may therefore represent a useful indicator of eutrophication and coral reef "health". This dissertation contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the factors affecting bioerosion by microbial endolithic organisms, which are important but often overlooked agents of bioerosion in coral reefs...|$|E

But many other buildings of the historical heritage also need special attentions with their computer design prior to the restoration projects. Generally, in restoration work, hand drawing and artistic criteria have been more usual than work with precision topographic data and accurate technical plans.  But a very rigorous design is not always enough to start restoration work. The real state that presents a historical building could have been modified substantially from its original state due to previous interventions, wars, seismic movements, <b>erosion,</b> <b>biological</b> aggressions or any other historical event.  So, it is necessary to join CAAD tasks with a simulation of the historical process suffered by the building. Historical data and ancient cartography must be the basis of all the CAAD works, {{and the quality of the}} computer 3 D model can be established comparing it with the original available maps.  This paper explains the CAAD works and the intervention proposals for the restoration of the City Walls of Hondarribia, a small Spanish village placed in the frontier between Spain and France. These Renaissance bastioned walls were partially destroyed throughout many wars with France. The exact knowledge of their original trace and dimensions only is possible comparing the real CAD models with the plans that exist in the Spanish Military Archives since the XVIth. century.  The digital store and index of all the historical information, their comparison with real photographs of the city walls, the creation of photo realistic images with the intervention proposals, and the influence of the structural repairs in the final project will be explained in the CAAD context...|$|R
40|$|Over many centuries, {{agricultural}} soil management {{has led to}} wind and water erosion of soil and to degradation of soil physical, chemical, biological, and hydrological qualities. This is because the dominant farming paradigm is based on mechanical tillage of various types to control weeds and to soften the top soil {{to serve as a}} seedbed for crop establishment, and to loosen the compacted subsoil layer. Consequently, tillage is still considered to be normal and necessary, and mechanized tillage {{is considered to be a}} symbol of ‘modern’ agriculture. However, it is also known to be the major root cause of soil degradation, leading to loss of many of the ecosystem functions and services, including biological production. Over the last few decades, the concept of sustainable production intensification (SPI) has taken shape. SPI methods aim at supporting productive agricultural systems capable of delivering maximum yields and ecosystem services while being resource efficient and resilient. Overall, this translates into producing more from less, and sustainably, primarily with regards to soil and water, but also from other inputs such as fertilizers, plant protection products, energy, labour and capital. It also means that certain ecosystem services that are soil-mediated, such as carbon sequestration, water resource quantity and quality, water regulation, control of <b>erosion,</b> <b>biological</b> nitrogen fixation, control of certain weeds, insect pest and diseases, can be enhanced. The three interlinked principles of Conservation Agriculture: (i) minimal soil disturbance (based on no-till), (ii) permanent soil cover; and (iii) crop diversity, are increasingly being accepted as constituting the core or foundation elements that simultaneously improve the overall soil conditions necessary to enhance its ecosystem functions while allowing for increased levels of productivity with reduced inputs. This communication discusses the evidence on the role of Conservation Agriculture in sustainable soil management for enhancing ecosystem services and production intensification...|$|R
40|$|Eolian dust (windblown silt and clay) and {{biological}} soil crusts are both important to ecosystem functioning of arid lands. Dust furnishes essential nutrients, influences hydrology, contrib-utes to soil formation, and renders surfaces vulnerable to <b>erosion.</b> <b>Biological</b> soil crusts contribute directly to soil fertility by fixing carbon and nitrogen, and indirectly by trapping newly-deposited dust and stabilizing already-present soil. Results from crust-stabi-lized, unconsolidated sandy sediments on prominent rock exposures and grasslands show dust inputs have significantly increased all bio-essential nutrients in soils of SE Utah, including P, K, Mg, Na, and Ca. As plants can be P and K-limited in these soils, dust may be essential for plant growth. Evidence for eolian dust comes from magnetic, chemical, and mineralogic {{properties of the}} soils that contrast greatly with those of local bedrock. For example, magne-tite, which formed originally in igneous rocks, is common in soils but absent in the local sedimentary bedrock. In view of the regional geology, particle-size distribution of soils, and patterns of proper-ties, the magnetite represents long-distance transport of eolian dust. Dust in the biological soil crusts, when compared to underlying sediment, shows higher magnetite, Zr, and Zr/Ti, suggesting that dust sources have changed {{over the past few}} decades. It is suggested that recent human disturbance in areas surrounding the Colorado Plateau may be responsible for this change in dust source. Because most of the fertility in these soils is due to dust input, it is of concern to land managers when soil loss via wind and water erosion exceeds this input. Ever-increasing use of these desert landscapes by recre-ation, military and agricultural activities generally destroys the biological soil crusts that are critical for nitrogen, carbon, and soil stability. Thus, increased erosion, and reduced dust retention, may be a result of these activities...|$|R
40|$|Marine bioeroders, borers, and burrowers {{can have}} drastic effects to marine {{habitats}} and facilities. By physically altering {{the structure of}} marine habitats, these organisms may elicit ecosystem-level effects that cascade through the community. While borer damage is typically restricted to a few substratum types, burrowing isopods in the genus Sphaeroma attack a diversity of substrata in tropical and temperate systems. My dissertation examined how boring sphaeromatid isopods affect coastal habitats (saltmarshes, mangroves) and other estuarine substrata as well as marine structures. I used a combination of lab and mensurative field experiments to quantify the effects of boring by isopods and examine how select factors affect the colonization, hence burrowing damage by isopods. I explored these questions primarily using the temperate boring sphaeromatid, Sphaeroma quoianum, as a model organism. My initial lab experiments quantified the per capita erosion rates of S. quoianum in four commonly attacked estuarine substrata. I found marsh banks and Styrofoam substrata were the most affected per capita. I supplemented this lab experiment with a year-long mensurative field experiment examining how erosion rates differ between marshes infested and uninfested by boring isopods. Marshes infested with isopods eroded 300 % faster than uninfested marshes. I further examined the boring effects on Styrofoam floats. I compiled surveys and observations and conducted a short experiment to describe how isopods affect Styrofoam floats used in floating docks. I observed dense colonies of isopods attacking floats and expelling millions of plastic particles in the ocean. The boring effects to simulated Styrofoam floats were also affected by seawater temperature. Burrowing effects in Styrofoam floats exhibited a curvilinear relationship with temperature and peaked around 18 °C. These results suggest a 1 - 2 °C increase in water temperature could increase boring effects 5 - 17 % of populations of isopods in Oregon and California bays. To examine the small-scale factors that mediate colonization and boring, I {{conducted a series of}} binary choice experiments. I found the presence of conspecifics, biofilm, and shade were important factors influencing colonization. These small scale factors likely explain why isopod attack is focused in some substrata. Finally, to examine the boring effects of tropical isopods in mangroves, I examined the associations between burrowing by S. terebrans and mangrove performance and fecundity. I found negative relationships between boring effects and performance and fecundity in two mangrove species in a restored mangrove stand in Taiwan. Together, these studies elucidate the effects of bioerosive isopods on saltmarshes, mangroves, and marine structures. However, the similar mechanisms involved in bioerosion in other boring species suggest that these results can be used to infer similar effects of other borers. In addition, since many species of sphaeromatid isopods have been introduced, this research shows how the effects of a non-native bioeroder can damage marine facilities and degrade and alter marine habitats. Through <b>biological</b> <b>erosion</b> and thus changing the physical structure of a marine habitat these non-native species can have ecosystem-level effects that cascade throughout the local community...|$|E
40|$|Soil erosion {{is one of}} {{the most}} devastating soil {{degradation}} processes. In temperate climate regions, soil erosion rarely assumes excessive proportions. In the management of forest soil, the potential erosion threat drastically increases with an increase in climate aridity. Water erosion is particularly favored by parent materials of low water permeability and by soils derived from such materials. In theMediterranean and sub-Mediterranean area of Croatia, these are primarily flysch, marl and Werfen schists. These materials show good physical weathering properties, thus providing a rich source of erosion material. As a rule, the soil formed from such parentmaterial is of silty-clayey to clayey texture, and has a relatively low infiltration capacity. The soil unprotected by vegetation (burned sites) manifests particularly devastating forms of water-induced erosion. In the past 50 years, flysch terrains of Istria have been subjected to a series of technical, biological and biological- technical treatments aimed at preventing water erosion and recovering the eroded soils. An experimental (research) site was set up in Abrami near Buzet for the purpose of monitoring erosion processes and rehabilitation effects of different biological-technical and biological methods of eroded area recovery. The effects of the treatments on soil properties in the research site are in the form of progressive pedogenetic processes. Asynergy of the effects of recovery methods and different natural conditions (relief, vegetation) in the experimental site is particularly well reflected in erosion indicators, such as the production of erosion sediment (erosion production), and to a lesser extent, the surface flow index. For this reason, research in this work focuses primarily on soil properties and erosion production dynamics. From the geological-lithological aspect, the research site of Abrami is made up of Eocene flysch composed of alternate layers of light grey marl and dark lime sandstone, i. e. thinner or thicker interbeds of sandy limestone. The climate is sub-Mediterranean. The mean annual temperature is 12 °C and the mean annual precipitation is 975 mm. The natural potential vegetation in the localities is represented by the community of hop hornbeam and autumn moor grass. Established in 1956 on the slope exposed to highly pronounced erosion processes, the research site has an area of 23. 46 ha. Aseries of technical and <b>biological</b> <b>erosion</b> recovery measures had been undertaken in the site by 1963 for the purpose of investigating their applicability in practice. Technical activities included the construction of step-like terraces, of the bench terrace type (»gradoni«), and contour rustic walls. Avariety of plant material was planted and seeds of different plant species were sown in the area (Table 1). Several control plots were also established in parts of the Abrami site, where either no treatment was applied or the seedlings were planted into the planting holes. Six plots intended for the measurement of erosion sediment production were established in 1969, followed by research into the quantitative erosion indicators, which started in 1970 (Table 1). After an interruption in 1977, measurements were resumed in 1997 and 1998 (two plots) and in 1999 (three plots). Erosion indicators have continuously been measured since 2000; however, measurements in plot I (plot I was omitted from this research due to its specific features) have been performed by means of terrestrial photogrammetry. The seventh plot was established in 2004, and has been the subject of measurements since 2005. This work encompasses measurement data from 2005, 2006 and 2007. The research includes plots II, III, IV,V, aswell asVI and VII. The soil and organic residues were sampled in the immediate surroundings of the erosion-measuring plots. Next to the plots in which no technical recovery measures were undertaken, a pedological profile was opened and the soil was sampled by horizons. Some smaller plots of 50 x 50 cm were used to sample the forest floor in 3 points next to the plots (near the top, in the middle of the slope and near the bottom). Undisturbed soil from the depth of 0 - 5 cm was cylinder-sampled in these smaller plots. The soil profiles next to the terraced plots were not sampled. The forest floor was sampled in small 50 x 50 cm plots, particularly those established on the slopes and on the top of the bench terraces. After the removal of the forest floor, the soil in the small plots was sampled with a probe (disturbed soil) to a 10 cmdepth, and with a cylinder (undisturbed soil) to a 5 cmdepth. The granulometric soil composition was determined according to HRN ISO 11277 : 2004, the pH according to HRN ISO 10390 : 2005, the CaCO 3 content according to HRN ISO 10693 : 2004, organic carbon (TOC) according to HRN ISO 10694 : 2004, porosity according to HR ISO 11508 and 11272 2004, water retention capacity according to HRN ISO 11461 : 2001, air capacity according to HRN ISO 11580 and 11272 : 2004, and soil water permeability according to HRN ISO 17312 : 2005. Measurements of erosion parameters were based on the cumulative measurement of runoff and erosion sediment for each particular rain event (in some cases several rain events were measured cumulatively). Water with eroded particles was determined in the field by measuring water levels in retention basins and/or tubs. The total quantity of erosion sediment in the collected waterwas determined according to theHRNISO 4365 standard. Rain events were registered in the site itself with a pluviograph within the meteorological station of Abrami. In converting the erosion production mass into volume, the average erosion sediment density was assumed to be 1. 2 Mg m- 3. Statistical analyses (descriptive statistics, correlations, t-test) were performed with STATISTICA 7. 1 software. Research into soil physiography in the site did not show any significant differences between the samples, regardless of sampling depths (the pHinwater suspension is between 7. 7 and 7. 9),which indicates long-term erosion impacts, that is, the homogeneity of the material. The soil in plot II does not have a developed humus-accumulative horizon. It is a strongly skeletal eutric regosol with a discontinued layer of the forest floor (the layer contains 1, 531 kg ha– 1 of dry organic matter). The soil in the surface 0. 5 cmismoderately porous (48. 4 %), with moderatewater capacity (37 %) and low water permeability (Table 2). In plots II and III (one immediately next to the other) the soil is eutric cambisol, with a depth of č 90 cm. The depth of the humus-accumulative horizon is only 2 – 4 cm,which reflects the erosion impact in the past. The slightly-to-moderately porous soil has relatively low water permeability (Table 2). In plot V the soil is eroded eutric cambisol with a discontinued A-horizon. This is shallower and texturally lighter soil than the soil in plots III andVII. In terms of granulometric composition, the soil is silty loam. Water permeability is very fast in the surface 5 cm. In plots IV and VI, the soil in the surface 10 cm is of silty-clayey texture, both on the slopes and the terraces. On the terraces of these plots the soil ismore compacted and the forest floor accumulation is higher, but water permeability is lower than on the slopes of the bench terraces. The annual precipitation amount ranged from 908 mm in 2005, over 979 mm in 2006, to 1. 167 mm in 2007. During 2005, the least precipitation occurred in the first annual quarter (< 100 mm), while in the other 3 quarters the amount of precipitation was very similar. During 2006 and 2007, precipitation amounts by quarters were almost identical: most rainfall occurred in the 1 st, followed by the 3 rd quarter, and the least occurred in the 4 th quarter (Fig. 5). Measurements of surface runoff and erosion production show that the most severe erosion occurred in plot II (Fig. 5). In the early 1970 s, the annual erosion production in this plot amounted to over 500 m 3 km- 2, while during the three-year measurement period it came to between 47. 9 and 65. 3 m 3 km- 2. More than half of the erosion production took place in the 3 rd annual quarter. Of other plots, distinct production is manifested by plot V and plot VII (Fig. 5 and 6). In the three remaining plots, the annual erosion production is considerably lower and does not exceed 0. 5 m 3 km- 2. There is no significant difference in the dynamics of annual production, except that erosion extremes occurred in plot IV in 2007, which coincides with the extremes in plots II and V. The lowest surface runoff coefficient was identified in plot III and the highest in plot II. Themean annual runoff coefficient in plot II ranges between 0. 052 and 0. 076, and the maximal comes to as much as 0. 397. This suggests a very low infiltration capacity of precipitation water. Namely, in this plot the soil is shallow regosol of silty texture (72 % of silt) and of very poor water permeability capacity (k= 0. 04 m/day). Erosion production in plots IV andVI is very low (Fig. 5). Overall biomass production in plot VI is lower than in plot IV, while the quantity of forest floor is similar to that in plot II. On the other hand, better developed trees of black pine and a very dense layer of ground vegetation in plot IV are responsible for higher leaf litter quantities: 3, 312 kg ha- 1 on the slopes of the bench terraces and 4, 144 kg ha- 1 on the terraces. It was found that erosion production was lower in the plots with higher organic matter content (in the forest floor and the mineral part of the soil). All these point to a series of mutual impacts, which synergistically determine the rate and intensity of erosion in these plots. This is explained by lower erosion sediment production in Plot IV in comparison with plots V and VI, although the terrain in plot IV has a much steeper slope. On the other hand, it is evident that, compared to plot V in which only biological recovery measures were applied, the application of technical recovery measures in plots IV and VI resulted in a much earlier reduction of erosion intensities. According to the results of research, the application of biological-technical recovery measures increases soil permeability and the soil organic matter content in proportion to the steepness of the terrain. The steeper the terrain, the higher the content is. In this climatic region, the most erodible period occurs in the 3 rd quarter of the year. Erosion production in the terrain recovered with biological-technical measures is very low, regardless of the distribution and intensity of precipitation; on the other hand, biological recovery itself, without any technical measures, results in much weaker erosion control...|$|E

Vodnoj eroziji osobito pogoduju slabo vodopropusni supstrati i tlo koje iz njih nastaje, kao što je fliš. Flišna erodirana zemljišta dosta su rasprostranjena u Istri, gdje smo i proveli ovo istraživanje. Na poligonu za istraživanje erozije Abrami (kod Buzeta) na 6 pokusnih ploha istražili smo svojstva tla i tijekom 3 godine (2005., 2006. i 2007.) mjerili količinu oborine i produkciju erozijskoga nanosa. Na dvjema plohama prije 50 godina provedena je biološko-tehnička sanacija erozije, na jednoj su provedene biološke mjere, dvije su bile kontrolne (jedna na blagom nagibu i s autohtonom degradiranom šumskom vegetacijom, a druga, jako erodirana, na strmom nagibu). Jedna ploha na blagom nagibu uspostavljena je 2004. godine – iskrčena je sva drvenasta vegetacija. Godišnja je količina oborine bila između 908 mmu 2005. godini, preko 979 mmu 2006. godini do 1 167 mmu 2007. Više od polovice erozijske produkcije odvija se u 3. kvartalu godine. Istraživanja su pokazala da se biološkotehnič kom sanacijom povećava vodopropusnost tla i sadržaj organske tvari u tlu, to više što je strmije zemljište. Pokazalo se da je na zemljištu saniranom biološko-tehničkim mjerama vrlo niska erozijska produkcija, bez obzira na raspored i intenzitet oborine, a sama biološka sanacija, bez tehničkih mjera, rezultira značajno slabijim utjecajem na suzbijanje erozije.

40|$|Introduction: Soil {{structural}} stability affects the profitability and sustainability of agricultural systems. Particle size distribution (PSD) and aggregate stability are the important characteristics of soil. Aggregate stability {{has a significant}} impact on the development of the root system, water and carbon cycle and soil resistance against soil erosion. Soil aggregate stability, defined as the ability of the aggregates to remain intact when subject to a given stress, is an important soil property that affects the movement and storage of water, aeration, <b>erosion,</b> <b>biological</b> activity and growth of crops. Dry soil aggregate stability (Mean Weight Diameter (MWD), Geometric Mean Diameter (GMD)) and Wet Aggregate Stability (WAS) are important indices for evaluating soil aggregate stability. To improve soil physical properties, including modifying aggregate, using various additives (organic, inorganic and chemicals), zeolites are among what has been studied. According to traditional definition, zeolites are hydratealuminosilicates of alkaline and alkaline-earth minerals. Their structure is made up of a framework of[SiO 4]− 4 and [AlO 4]− 5 tetrahedron linked to each other's cornersby sharing oxygen atoms. The substitution of Si+ 4 by Al+ 3 intetrahedral sites results inmore negative charges and a high cation exchange capacity. Zeolites, as natural cation exchangers, are suitable substitutes to remove toxic cations. Among the natural zeolites,Clinoptilolite seems to be the most efficient ion exchanger and ion-selective material forremoving and stabilizing heavy metals. Due to theexisting insufficient technical information on the effects of using different levels of zeolite on physical properties of different types of soils in Iran, the aim of this research was to assess the effects of two different types of zeolite (Clinoptilolite natural zeolite, Z 4, and Synthetic zeolite, A 4) on aggregate stability indicesof soil. Materials and Methods: In this study at first, after preparation of two different types of soil with light and medium texture and doing identification tests such as determination of gradation and hydrometer tests and Atterberg limits, zeolite in four levels, 0 (control), 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} changes {{recorded}} by lacustrine sediments from SW Anatolia in Turkey {{in the context}} of increasing stress on the Mediterranean environment in relation to human-climate-environmental interactions. Paleolimnological investigations were carried out on Lake Burdur (Lake District geographical subregion of Turkey), which has been subject to rapid changes in its hydrological system that caused a ~ 10 -m water-level drop in the last 30 years. Study of a 5 -m-long sediment core, taken from the recently dried out part of the lake, shows significant variation in granulometry, clay mineralogy, nitrogen and organic carbon content and its isotopic composition (∂ 13 Corg) throughout the sedimentary sequence, which represents the last 2, 300 years. Chronology is based on radiocarbon dates obtained from plant fragments. The results provide a record of environmental changes, including <b>biological</b> productivity and <b>erosion</b> intensity, in relation to changes in water level and humidity of the area. The lowest previous water level, which is the same as observed today, occurred at approximately 300 BC, after which time a water-level increase led to a maximum stage between AD 200 and 1200. From AD 1200 to the present, the climate became drier accompanied by an overall lowering of water level, with periods of water-level fluctuations superimposed. The lake never dried out as is observed today at the coring site. The present drop in the lake water level is attributed to human activity rather than to climate change. This record of climate and environmental change in the Lake Burdur area appears to be stratigraphically complete. This study provides rare data for the late Holocene in Anatolia as well as information about rapid climate changes during specific periods. The influence of both the Northern hemisphere atmospheric circulation and Indian monsoon on the east Mediterranean remains unclear. Nevertheless, the North Sea [...] Caspian atmospheric teleconnection could be an important factor that explains local differences in climatic evolution of Anatolia during the period considered...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{degradation}} processes {{have achieved}} {{the recognition of}} a global environmental problem in recent years. It has been suggested by various international forums and organizations {{that in order to}} adequately establish methods to combat land degradation, it is necessary to evaluate this degradation locally and at a detailed scale. The evaluation of soil degradation of natural ecosystems at a detailed scale requires the definition of standards to which to compare this degradation. To define these standards and properly handle the processes that give rise to variations in soil quality and degradation, it is necessary to establish in some detail the pedogenic processes that have or have not taken place in a particular area and which lead to the formation of a mature soil. A mature soil should be considered as standard in these situations and, therefore, a non-degraded soil. This paper presents the possible evolutive and regressive sequences of soil, and provides some examples of using this methodology to evaluate the degradation of the same in the Monteverde of the island of Tenerife. It also presents some physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of climacic mature soils, degraded soils and low quality soils, and examines their similarities and differences in this bioclimatic environment and on different parent materials. Thus it is observed that the main processes of degradation in these areas are related to plant cover modifications that lead to the decreasing protection of the soil surface, which results in the long term, in the onset of degradation processes such as water <b>erosion,</b> <b>biological</b> degradation, loss of andic properties, compaction and sealing and crusting surface, loss of water retention capacity, illuviation, etc. Climacic soils that can be found in areas of steep lava flows are Leptosols, while gently sloping areas are Cambisols and Andosols. On pyroclastic materials there are vitric Andosols and andic Andosols according to their degree of evolution. The most characteristic regressive processes are illuviation/leaching, resulting in Luvisols, Lixisols and Alisols; and water erosion, causing the presence of secondary Leptosols...|$|R
