As part of the $1 million effort, the United States Department of State requested help from the Soviet Union who sent two icebreakers, Admiral Makarov and Vladimir Arseniev, to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> trapping the whales.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} winter {{navigation}} in Finland {{dates back to}} the 17th century when mail was carried year-round between Turku, Finland and Grisslehamn, Sweden, over the Sea of Åland. During the winter season, the postmen used ice boats, strengthened sleigh-boats that were pushed over the ice until it gave in {{under the weight of the}} boat. Once in water, the men began rocking the boat back and forth until it slowly began to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> and proceed towards open water. The mail route was often called the most dangerous in Europe.|$|E

25|$|In {{many ways}} Avance resembled the first {{state-owned}} icebreaker of Finland, Murtaja, although her bow was of improved Swedish design which increased her icebreaking capability. The {{angle of the}} stem, {{the first part of}} the ship to encounter and <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> was 22 degrees. Still, she was of the same outdated European design as Murtaja and thus had similar problems in difficult ice conditions. Her coal stores were also located too far in the front, resulting in an unfavourable trim at full load. Despite her shortcomings Avance was found out to be suitable for service within the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Although icebreaking {{cargo ships}} {{had been built}} in the past, their hull forms were always compromises between open water {{performance}} and icebreaking capability. A good icebreaking bow, designed to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> by bending it under the ship's weight, has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to slamming in heavy weather. However, a hydrodynamically efficient bulbous bow greatly increases the ice resistance, making it unsuitable for icebreakers. As a result, the total efficiency of icebreaking ships is 20–40% less than that of good open water vessels of similar size mainly due to the bow form.|$|E
25|$|Icebreakers {{were used}} on the canal, for instance, {{at the end of}} the boating season when winter froze the canal, so that the last group of boats could go home. The {{icebreaker}} was typically a company scow filled with pig iron. Mules would pull the boat onto the ice, and the weight would <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> During the Civil war, the canal company attempted to keep the canal open during the winters of 1861-1862, despite the fact that winters were usually for repairs. Icebreaker boats were used to keep the channel free of ice, so that the military could move supplies.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, the US Postal Service {{began using}} the British built Hoverwork AP1-88 to haul mail, freight, and {{passengers}} from Bethel, Alaska, {{to and from}} eight small villages along the Kuskokwim River. Bethel is {{far removed from the}} Alaska road system, thus making the hovercraft an attractive alternative to the air based delivery methods used prior to introduction of the hovercraft service. Hovercraft service is suspended for several weeks each year while the river is beginning to freeze to minimize damage to the river ice surface. The hovercraft is able to operate during the freeze-up period; however, this could potentially <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> and create hazards for villagers using their snowmobiles along the river during the early winter.|$|E
25|$|Although icebreaking {{cargo ships}} {{had been built}} in the past, their hull forms were always compromises between open water {{performance}} and icebreaking capability. A good icebreaking bow, designed to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> by bending it under the ship's weight, has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to slamming in heavy weather while a hydrodynamically efficient bulbous bow greatly increases the ice resistance. However, already in the late 1800s captains operating ships in icebound waters discovered that sometimes it was easier to break through ice by running their vessels astern. This was because the forward-facing propellers generated a water flow that lowered the resistance by reducing friction between the ship's hull and ice. These findings resulted in the adoption of bow propellers in older icebreakers operating in the Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, but as forward-facing propellers have a very low propulsion efficiency and the steering ability of a ship is greatly reduced when running astern, it could not be considered a main operating mode for merchant ships.|$|E

500|$|... "Beautiful" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Linda Perry. Aguilera recorded the song at two studios: The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, and Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood. Prior to the collaboration with Aguilera, Perry {{had written the}} song and originally wished to keep the [...] "personal" [...] record for her own singing career. Perry initially previewed the song for Pink during the recording sessions of Pink's second studio album Missundaztood (2001), on which Perry is a producer. However, after hearing Aguilera sing the song at Perry's house to [...] "break the ice", Perry was very impressed and allowed Aguilera to include the track on her then upcoming record Stripped, effectively deciding not to pursue a solo career. The choice resulted in a feud between Pink against Aguilera and Perry, with the former commenting that it was [...] "annoying" [...] for the latter to collaborate with artists [...] " [...] didn't like". Perry later revealed to ASCAP, [...] "When Christina came {{over to my house}} to start working, she asked me to play some songs to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> [...] I had a long conversation with my manager about it. We both decided to hear Christina sing it. We demoed the song with her singing it, and I was like, 'Wow'. That rough vocal is what is out there on radio. It was that vocal that got her the song". Perry's wife Sara Gilbert confirmed on her show The Talk that the final version was [...] "just a demo." [...] Gilbert also revealed that Aguilera wanted to rerecord the song because she didn't like the initial vocals. Perry denied the request because the song is supposed to be about imperfection and being vulnerable.|$|E

[...] He also had some previous production experience, having produced one album apiece by Adams, Doug and the Slugs and CANO in the early 1980s. The band's lead vocalist Alan Frew recalled: [...] "It worked out great because we were {{all at the same}} stage of development. He didn't change the sound of the band at all. He let us experiment but wasn't afraid to get heavy-handed when he had to." [...] Vallance composed [...] "Don't Forget Me (When I'm Gone)" [...] with the band, while Adams provided backing vocals. Frew - [...] "On the very first day that we met Jim Vallance, he picked us up at the airport and to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> asked us what we were listening to. One was Tears For Fears. We went to his house and drank tea and listened to some tunes. 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World' came on and we really liked the shuffle beat.
