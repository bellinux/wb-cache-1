25|$|In Rabbit Hollow, {{through which}} Ackerly Creek flows, there are {{numerous}} bird species, including Louisiana waterthrush, Cooper's hawk, wood thrush, swamp sparrow, pileated woodpecker, <b>belted</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> red-winged blackbird, and gray catbird. Mammals in the hollow include rabbits, woodchucks, chipmunks, squirrels, and white-tailed deer.|$|E
25|$|Syndactyly, as {{it occurs}} in birds, is like anisodactyly, except that {{the third and fourth}} toes (the outer and middle forward-pointing toes), or three toes, are fused together, as in the <b>belted</b> <b>kingfisher</b> Ceryle alcyon. This is {{characteristic}} of Coraciiformes (kingfishers, bee-eaters, rollers, etc.).|$|E
25|$|As {{trees are}} drowned by rising beaver impoundments, they become ideal nesting sites for woodpeckers, which carve {{cavities}} that attract many other bird species, including flycatchers (Empidonax spp.), tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), tits (Paridae spp.), wood ducks (Aix sponsa), goldeneyes (Bucephala spp.), mergansers (Mergus spp.), owls (Tytonidae, Strigidae) and American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Piscivores, including herons (Ardea spp.), grebes (Podicipedidae), cormorants (Phalacrocorax ssp.), American bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosa), great egret (Ardea alba), snowy egret (Egretta thula), mergansers, and belted kingfishers (Megaceryle alcyon), use beaver ponds for fishing. Hooded mergansers (Lophodytes cucullatus), green heron (Butorides virescens), {{great blue heron}} (Ardea herodias) and <b>belted</b> <b>kingfisher</b> appeared more frequently in New York wetlands where beaver were active than at sites with no beaver activity.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>belted</b> <b>kingfisher's</b> {{specific}} name (Megaceryle alcyon) also references her name.|$|R
5|$|Eight {{species of}} birds inhabit the {{floodplains}} and slopes near Mahoning Creek. These include scarlet tanagers, black-throated green warblers, <b>belted</b> <b>kingfishers,</b> gray catbirds, black-capped chickadees, eastern wood-peewees, Louisiana waterthrushes, and wood thrushes.|$|R

500|$|Robert Ridgway's first publication, {{at the age}} of 18, was {{an article}} about the <b>belted</b> <b>kingfisher.</b> [...] In {{the course of the next}} 60 years, he would go on to publish more than 500 titles and 13,000 printed pages, most of it {{concerning}} North American birds.|$|E
500|$|Worlds End State Park is {{featured}} in the Audubon Society's Susquehanna River Birding and Wildlife Trail Guide. Birds {{of interest in the}} park include common mergansers along the creek and other riparian species such as <b>belted</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> as well as barred, great horned, and the scarce, elusive northern saw-whet owls. Other avian species seen in the park and believed to nest there include tufted titmouse, brown creeper, red-breasted nuthatch, common raven, scarlet tanager, yellow-bellied sapsucker, and winter wren. These bird populations are typical of [...] "mature northern hardwood-hemlock forests and high elevation swamps and conifer swamps".|$|E
50|$|Delta Meadows {{preserves}} a river delta much as {{it appeared}} 150 years ago, crowded with stands of oak, tule, walnut, willow, and cottonwood. Abundant wildlife includes black-tailed deer, beavers, river otters, muskrats, and wetland birds such as great blue herons, wood ducks, mallards, <b>belted</b> <b>kingfishers,</b> and cormorants.|$|R
50|$|The Megaceryle {{large green}} kingfishers were {{formerly}} placed in Ceryle with the pied kingfisher, but {{the latter is}} closer to the Chloroceryle American green <b>kingfishers.</b> The <b>belted</b> <b>kingfisher's</b> closest living relative is the ringed kingfisher (M. torquata), and these two in all probability originated from an African Megaceryle which colonized the Americas.|$|R
25|$|North Lake is {{the largest}} of the three, and is known for its water birds that often live on the small islands within the lake. Some of the birds spotted are egrets, <b>belted</b> <b>kingfishers,</b> ducks, and great blue herons. It is {{surrounded}} by a paved walkway that is often used by families, joggers, and dog walkers.|$|R
500|$|Cypress {{trees are}} {{conifers}} that are adapted {{to live in}} standing fresh water. They grow in compact structures called cypress domes and in long strands over limestone. Water levels may fluctuate dramatically around cypress domes and strands, so cypresses develop [...] "knees" [...] that protrude from the water at high levels to provide oxygen for the root systems. Dwarf cypress trees grow in drier areas with poorer soil. Epiphytes, such as bromeliads, Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides), orchids and ferns grow on the branches and trunks of cypress trees. Everglades National Park features twenty-five species of orchids. Tall cypress trees provide excellent nesting areas for birds including wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), ibis, herons, egrets, anhingas (Anhinga anhinga), and <b>belted</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Megaceryle alcyon). Mammals in cypress regions include white-tailed deer, squirrels, raccoons, opossums, skunks, swamp rabbits, river otters (Lontra canadensis), and bobcats, as well as small rodents.|$|E
500|$|Humans {{introduced}} fish {{into the}} lake in the 1930s for sport fishing, including rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoliecas). [...] Trout were last released into Castle Lake in 2008 by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife but recreational fish stocking has since ceased due to concern for other species [...] (i.e., threatened or endangered). The brook char was also originally stocked but now has become self-sustaining, and reproduces naturally in springs found {{on the eastern side}} of the lake. Golden shiner is a bait fish minnow that was likely placed in the lake by anglers who left their remaining bait behind in the lake. The fish feed on zooplankton and insects; the fish are then eaten by predators around the lake, especially osprey (Pandion haliaetus). Other birds in the area include bald eagle (Haliaectus leucoephalus), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), wood duck (Aix sponsa), <b>belted</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Megaceryle alcyon), Steller's jay (Cyanocitta stellere), and sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus).|$|E
500|$|Before {{the area}} became urban, large mammals {{including}} bobcats, black bears, foxes, cougars, wolves, and elk thrived in the area. Common {{species in the}} 21stcentury include crow, robin, starling, song sparrow, Bewick's wren, house finch, cedar waxwing, violet-green swallow, <b>belted</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> great blue heron, mallard, wood duck, bushtit, black-capped chickadee, raccoon, opossum, nutria, and moles. Less developed areas support black-tailed deer, coyotes, deer mice, voles, bats, western flycatchers, black-headed grosbeaks, orange-crowned warblers, common mergansers, and woodpeckers. Other wildlife in the watershed include beaver, river otter, freshwater mussels, and bald eagles. Johnson Creek and its watershed are home to life forms that, under Oregon law, have been listed as [...] "sensitive" [...] species. These are naturally reproducing native animals that may become threatened or endangered throughout all or any significant part of their range in Oregon. Such animals known {{to live in the}} Johnson Creek watershed include long-toed, northwestern, and Columbia salamanders, red-legged frogs, painted turtles, great horned owls, toads, hawks, and coyotes. A plant found on Powell Butte, tall bugbane (Actaea elata), is also listed as a sensitive species.|$|E
50|$|Birds of many {{different}} species live at New River State Park. Osprey and red-tailed hawks are birds of prey {{that can be seen}} soaring above the park. Wild turkey live in the forested lowlands and ruffed grouse live on the mountain slopes. A wide variety of songbirds live throughout the forests. Wood ducks, spotted sandpipers and <b>belted</b> <b>kingfishers</b> live along the river banks.|$|R

50|$|The animal {{population}} includes birds (bald eagles, owls, <b>belted</b> <b>kingfishers,</b> cliff and northern rough-winged swallows, seagulls, sandpipers, and herons), mammals (black-tailed deer, mink, harbour seals, otters, bats), reptiles (garter snakes and possibly northern alligator lizard), and numerous invertebrates. Surprisingly, the raccoon is absent; {{its failure to}} become established on the island has allowed ground-nesting birds to maintain their populations. Mink is the only native predatory mammal on land. Many mice as well.|$|R
