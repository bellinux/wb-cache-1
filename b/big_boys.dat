5|$|Skate punk innovators {{also pointed}} in other {{directions:}} <b>Big</b> <b>Boys</b> helped establish funkcore, while Venice, California's Suicidal Tendencies had a formative {{effect on the}} heavy metal–influenced crossover thrash style. Toward {{the middle of the}} decade, D.R.I. spawned the superfast thrashcore genre. Both developed in multiple locations. Sacramento's Tales of Terror, which mixed psychedelic rock into their hardcore sound, were an early influence on the grunge genre.

50|$|The <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> {{served at}} Frisch's is {{slightly}} different than those at other <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants. Where Bob Wian dressed <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburgers with mayonnaise and red relish, Frisch later replaced these with tartar sauce and added dill pickles in his version and applied these {{in a different}} order. (Early Frisch's menus show that he used tartar sauce on hamburgers and cheeseburgers, but mayonnaise on his <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburgers.) Frisch's licensee Manners <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> used a similar tartar sauce on its <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburger. The use of tartar sauce on Frisch's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburgers wasn't {{simply a matter of}} taste. Frisch recognized the use of a single combined condiment was simpler and faster. Later the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> system adopted the idea, using the combined form of red relish and mayonnaise, commonly known as thousand island dressing, on <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburgers.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Bob's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> name, the [...] "Big Boy" [...] concept, menu, and mascot were originally licensed to a wide number of regional franchise holders (listed in the next section). Because many of the early franchisees were already {{in the restaurant business}} when joining <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> [...] "Big Boy" [...] was added to the franchisee name just as the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> hamburger was added to the franchisee's menu. In this sense it is confusing when referring to a chain, as each named franchisee was itself a chain and <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> could be considered a chain of chains. People tend to know <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> not simply as <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> but as the franchise from where they lived such as Bob's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in California, Shoney's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in the south or Frisch's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in much of Ohio, among the many others.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> {{was started}} as Bob's Pantry in 1936 by Bob Wian in Glendale, California. The {{restaurant}} {{became known as}} [...] "Bob's, Home of the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Hamburger" [...] then as Bob's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy.</b> It became a local chain under that name and nationally under the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> name, franchised by Robert C. Wian Enterprises. Marriott Corporation bought <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in 1967. One of the larger franchise operators, Elias Brothers, purchased the chain from Marriott in 1987, moved {{the headquarters of the}} company to Warren, Michigan, and operated it until bankruptcy was declared in 2000. During the bankruptcy, the chain was sold to investor Robert Liggett, Jr., who took over as Chairman, renamed the company <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants International and maintained the headquarters in Warren. The company is the operator or franchisor for 83 <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants in the United States. <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants International also licenses 279 <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants operating in Japan.|$|R
25|$|Austin's artistic {{community}} helped popularize {{artists such}} as Stevie Ray Vaughan, Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac, The Police, and Elvis Costello in the Southwest. Tex-Mex/new wave bands Vallejo and Joe King Carrasco & the Crowns gained some national fame. Local punk and new wave bands in the late 1970s included The Huns and the Skunks, along with The Delinquents, Standing Waves, and Jack Limbo. These bands soon clashed with an influx of hardcore punk bands like The Dicks, The Offenders, and <b>Big</b> <b>Boys.</b> Other notable Austin bands, such as ambient duo Stars of the Lid, eschewed this clash all together.|$|E
25|$|Minneapolis {{hardcore}} {{consisted of}} bands such as Hüsker Dü and The Replacements, while Chicago had Articles of Faith, Big Black and Naked Raygun.

500|$|Eurogamer's Chris Schilling {{commented that}} {{although}} Ancient Trader {{was not as}} comprehensive and expansive as other Xbox Live titles such as , it deserved [...] "the opportunity {{to do business with}} the <b>big</b> <b>boys</b> rather than risk getting washed away with the shovelware tide". Schilling expressed concern that [...] "a game so elegant and accomplished should have to be dredged up from the depths of Indie Games". Lorenzo Fantoni from Eurogamer Italy awarded Ancient Trader the same score as Schilling, and explained that [...] "the final result is a quite simple title, which will last long enough to make you feel happy of having invested your money in this indie title".|$|E
50|$|Immediately after Liggett's purchase, <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants International - {{then known}} as Liggett Restaurant Enterprises - {{negotiated}} {{an agreement with the}} other large franchise operator, Frisch's Restaurants. The <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> trademarks in Kentucky, Indiana, and most of Ohio and Tennessee transferred to Frisch's ownership; all other Frisch's territories transferred to Liggett. (As a franchisee, the bankruptcy threatened Frisch's future use of the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> trademark.) Thus Frisch's is no longer a franchisee, but <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants International and Frisch's are now independent co-registrants of the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> name and trademark. Frisch's operates or franchises 121 <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{most modern}} franchises, the {{historic}} <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchisees differed somewhat {{from one another}} in pricing and menus. After purchasing <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in 1987, Elias Brothers intended to standardize the name and menu, but Bob's, Frisch's and McDowell's (now known as Bismarck <b>Big</b> <b>Boy)</b> continue to offer distinctions from the standard <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> menu.|$|R
50|$|Vip's (New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming, 19621982. {{founded by}} Daniel T. Hogan and James O'Conner) Vip's refers to two {{distinct}} restaurant chains.

The other, Vip's Restaurants of Salem, Oregon, was not a <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchisee but sold units to JB's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> which operated them as Bob's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy.</b> The non-Big Boy, Salem-based chain had 53 locations at its peak, all sold and rebranded, including 35 to Denny's in 1982 and 16 to JB's in 1984.|$|R

By mid-November, however, he told the Associated Press that he was [...] "leaning to staying, but nothing's firm." [...] Mitchell instead chose to forgo his senior year and entered the NFL Draft in early January 2001. He stated, [...] "I have had a great time, but it's {{time for me to}} give {{something}} back to my family." [...] Mitchell said he would be quieter in the NFL: [...] "You won't hear no more trash talking from Freddie Mitchell, those are the <b>big</b> <b>boys,</b> I'm just a little kid again. I'm humble." [...] He had 119 catches for 2,135yards and 10 touchdowns in his career as a Bruin.|$|E
500|$|Recalling FIG's {{appearance}} at the Total Music Meeting, guitarist Eugene Chadbourne said [...] "The lack of support for FIG must obviously extend {{beyond the boundaries of}} that group into the entire area of women musicians ... I am sure the lack of men on stage made some men feel excluded." [...] Schweizer believed that many male improvisers felt threatened by FIG because of their use of humour, [...] "We were not that serious, like men, ... they take [...] so seriously". Georgie Born described FIG's humour as [...] "very iconoclastic and very surreal, or very silly. There were no <b>big</b> <b>boys</b> there standing judging." [...] On the issue of FIG being a women-only group, Nicols remarked, [...] "It's amazing the number of men that were saying, 'Why are there no men?' And yet nobody had ever dreamed to think of asking why there were men only [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Among the {{earliest}} hardcore bands, regarded as having {{made the first}} recordings in the style, were Southern California's Middle Class and Black Flag. Bad Brains—all of whom were black, a rarity in punk of any era—launched the D.C. scene with their rapid-paced single 'Pay to Cum" [...] in 1980. Austin, Texas's <b>Big</b> <b>Boys,</b> San Francisco's Dead Kennedys, and Vancouver's D.O.A. were among the other initial hardcore groups. They were soon joined by bands such as the Minutemen, Descendents, Circle Jerks, Adolescents, and T.S.O.L. in Southern California; D.C.'s Teen Idles, Minor Threat, and State of Alert; and Austin's MDC and the Dicks. By 1981, hardcore was the dominant punk rock style not only in California, {{but much of the}} rest of North America as well. A New York hardcore scene grew, including the relocated Bad Brains, New Jersey's Misfits and Adrenalin O.D., and local acts such as the Mob, Reagan Youth, and Agnostic Front. Beastie Boys, who would become famous as a hip-hop group, debuted that year as a hardcore band. They were followed by the Cro-Mags, Murphy's Law, and Leeway. By 1983, St. Paul's Hüsker Dü, Willful Neglect, Chicago's Naked Raygun, Indianapolis's Zero Boys, and D.C.'s the Faith were taking the hardcore sound in experimental and ultimately more melodic directions. Hardcore would constitute the American punk rock standard throughout the decade. The lyrical content of hardcore songs is often critical of commercial culture and middle-class values, as in Dead Kennedys' celebrated [...] "Holiday in Cambodia" [...] (1980).|$|E
5000|$|Frisch's {{now owns}} the [...] "Big Boy" [...] {{name in a}} defined four state region, and Azar's and Bob's are {{licensed}} by Frisch's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> and <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Restaurants International, respectively. Many of the other former franchise owners (Shoney's, particularly) have expanded into the former territories of other franchise holders. Prohibiting franchisees from publicly using their own names is intended to strengthen the trademark but also prevent defections, such as happened with Shoney's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> retaining identity as Shoney's. The same occurred with Eat'n Park, Elby's, Lendy's, JB's, and Abdow's who kept their names after leaving <b>Big</b> <b>Boy.</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> now permits operators to informally identify by location such as Tawas Bay <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> in East Tawas, Michigan.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{distinct}} East and West Coast <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> mascots, dual versions of Adventures were produced, identical {{except for the}} detail of the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> figure. In July 1969 the versions merged, and a fluffy brown haired <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> appeared. In 1976 Shoney's discontinued use of the Marriott book, publishing their own instead. Contracted to Paragon Products, this version featured an older, leaner <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> with his siblings Katie and Tripp replacing Dolly and Nugget, and {{was adopted by the}} JB's and Azar's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchises. [...] After 75 issues it became Shoney's Fun and Adventure Magazine introducing a Shoney's mascot ("Uncle Ed" [...] bear) in place of <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> allowing it to serve Shoney's non-Big Boy restaurants.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982, Shoney's began {{launching}} {{restaurants in}} Florida and Kentucky, branded as [...] "Shoney's Towne and Country" [...] because Frisch's owned the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> rights in these states. Nonetheless, Frisch's sued for trademark infringement, claiming a strong {{association of the}} [...] "Shoney's" [...] name with [...] "Big Boy". While these lawsuits failed, similar suits by Frisch's against Elby's complicated Elby's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> advertising in the upper Ohio Valley. Therefore, in 1984 Shoney's broke affiliation with <b>Big</b> <b>Boy.</b> At {{the time it was}} the largest <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> franchisee, with 392 Shoney's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> restaurants. As a result, the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> sandwich was renamed the [...] "All-American Hamburger," [...] and Shoney Bear was created as a corporate mascot.|$|R
500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only <b>big</b> <b>boys</b> don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'. Really miserable and down because I'm in the red, and the bills are coming in, poor old Lil [...] suffers as I don't want to get a rise. Not really true don't want to ask for a rise, fellows are having a pretty tough time as it is." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 80s, several US {{hardcore}} bands wrote queer-themed songs, and Gary Floyd of The Dicks along with Randy Turner of <b>Big</b> <b>Boys</b> were notable in both being out and outspoken gay men. In England, in the anarcho-punk scene, Andy Martin of The Apostles was equally forthright. Politically motivated US bands such as MDC and 7 Seconds also introduced anti-homophobia messages into their songs at this time, while the Nip Drivers included a song titled [...] "Quentin", dedicated to Quentin Crisp, in their repertoire.|$|E
