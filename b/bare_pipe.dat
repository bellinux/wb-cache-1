Prediction of transverse insertion loss (reduction in break-out noise) due to this composite lagging is the subject of the present paper. A transfer matrix for the porous absorptive layer is derived for cylindrical waves in the radial direction. Making use of an impedance model, radial velocities of the <b>bare</b> <b>pipe</b> and the outer jacket for the lagged pipe are calculated. These are then combined with respective radiation impedances to calculate insertion loss due to the composite lagging as well as the bare (unconstrained) lagging.

A total of six pipes were tested. Each pipe was loaded to produce a constant moment over the mid-length of the specimen. Experimental moment-curvature relationships into the plastic region of behavior were obtained. Theoretical ovaling values were computed, using a strain energy procedure, and were compared with experimental results. Empirical equations, relating the bending strength at buckling failure to the physical properties of the pipe were presented. The following conclusions were made: 1. An approach suggested by Ades satisfactorily predicted the moment-curvature and ovalization-curvature relationships for <b>bare</b> <b>pipes</b> under monotonic loading. 2. Diameter to thickness ratio controlled curvature at buckling failure. Pipes with lower D/t ratios were able to withstand greater curvature before the compression surface buckled. 3.

Introduction: To those unfamiliar with it, {{the subject of}} protecting steam pipes and heated surfaces from loss of heat must necessarily seem of small importance, for they are unaware of the great amount of heat that is lost from bare surfaces and the large proportion of it that can be saved {{by the use of}} a good covering. The average steam plant owner does not have this loss directly impressed upon himself. He may know there is one but he cannot easily determine its magnitude hence takes no precaution to arrest further loss. In some few situations where fuel is very cheap, and for certain classes of work it may happen that coverings would not be desirable; yet wherever the economical production and use of steam is of importance a good covering will prove one of the best investments that can be made. Its use in certain cases becomes necessary apart from any saving that would ensue where the radiation from <b>bare</b> <b>pipes</b> would make an engine room unbearable. Granting that coverings would prove a good investment, the would be purchaser is confronted by scores of manufacturers, making coverings of all conceivable materials and combinations of them supposed to have some insulating value. Each maker of coverings claims that his is the best and brings forth a report of some test in which his product shows the greatest efficiency of those tested. In most cases these results are open to question, being sometimes made by interested or at least not entirely unbiased persons, and in others due to defects in the methods of apparatus employed. The manufacturer never tests his covering except in competition with poorer ones. In some cases, while the results are perfectly reliable, the tests were made several years ago, in two instances fifteen and seventeen years, and the coverings have not been subjected to comparison with ones of later and perhaps improved manufacture...|$|R

The vacuum jacketed lines for the Ares I mobile launch platform were to be a combined 2000 feet long, with 60 + pipe sections and field joint cans. Historically, Kennedy Space Center has drilled a hole in the long sections to create a common vacuum with the field joint can to minimize maintenance on the vacuum jacketed piping. However, this effort looked at ways to use a passive system that didn't require a vacuum, but may cryopump to create its own vacuum.

The {{objective was to}} investigate how the polypropylene coating affected the global response of the pipes. The present work was a continuation of previous theses done on X 65 steel pipes without coating, and {{part of an ongoing}} research program between SIMLab (NTNU) and Statoil. The experimental work consisted of material testing and component tests. A tensile test of the X 65 steel was conducted, along with a compression test of the PP foam from the coating. The component tests consisted of quasi-static denting of pipes with and without coating, and a compression test of the coating component consisting of all the layers combined. Numerical simulations of all the tests were carried out with Abaqus/Explicit. A parameter study with a method called Factorial Design was conducted for the coating component. Dent depths of the <b>bare</b> steel <b>pipes</b> were estimated with the recommended practice, DNV-RP- 111. Lastly, a new alternative model that takes the PP coating into account was proposed. The experimental tests showed that for a given level of energy, the coated steel pipes had a significantly lower inner displacement compared to the pipes without coating. The material model for the PP foam underestimated the resistance of the coating. The coating layer in the numerical model initially consisted of one layer based on the PP foam. The Factorial Design indicated that a numerical model including the inner and outer solid PP layers, would not yield a significantly higher resistance. Numerical simulations of the coated steel pipes proved to be difficult. Large deformations in the coating layer lead to contact and distortion problems. The remeshing method ALE improved the simulation significantly, but did not solve the problems with the model entirely. Estimations done on the <b>bare</b> steel <b>pipes</b> with DNV-RP- 111 showed good correlation with the experiments, for a displacement up to 5 - 6 % of the outer diameter.

40|$|Abstract: This work {{describes}} a non-invasive method to detect leaks in buried pipes {{that uses a}} surface linear electrode array perpendicular to the pipe axis. Two electrodes inject current and the remaining electrodes detect the drop in voltage. We have used both the dipole-dipole array and a modified Schlumberger array. A single step reconstruction algorithm based on the sensitivity theorem yields 2 D images of the cross section. The corresponding sensitivity matrices are ill– posed. Nevertheless, the reconstructed images allow us to detect leaks without needing any regularisation parameter because {{it is possible to}} replace the inverse of the sensitivity matrix by their transposed. A personal computer controls current injection, electrode switching and voltage detection, which enables us to easily test different electrode arrays. The system has been first tested in the laboratory using a stainless steel tube immersed in water and covered by a rubber sleeve to simulate a non-conductive leak. By taking reference measurements with the immersed <b>bare</b> <b>pipe,</b> it is possible to reconstruct images showing the simulated leak using 16 electrodes and even 8 electrodes only, though with reduced resolution. Field measurements have involved simulated water leaks from a 1 m plastic tube, 8 cm in radius buried at about 24 cm depth in a farm field. The system injected 1 kHz, 20 V peak-to-peak square waveforms, thus avoiding electrode polarisation effects. Images reconstructed from an eight–electrode array show the leak if the image before the leak is used as reference...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a large}} {{backlog of}} {{plutonium}} contaminated materials at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site near Denver, Colorado, USA. The clean-up of this site requires this material to be packaged {{in such a way}} as to allow for efficient transportation to other sites or to a permanent geologic repository. Prior to off-site shipment of the material, it may be stored on-site for a period of time. For this reason, it is desirable to have a container capable of meeting the requirements for storage as well as the requirements for transportation. Most of the off-site transportation is envisioned to take place using the TRUPACT-II Type B package, with the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) as the destination. Prior to the development of this new container, the TRUPACT-II had a limit of 325 FGE (fissile gram equivalents) of plutonium due to criticality control concerns. Because of the relatively high plutonium content in the material to be transported, transporting 325 FGE per TRUPACT-II is uneconomical. Thus, the purpose of the new containers is to provide criticality control to increase the allowed TRUPACT-II payload and to provide a safe method for on-site storage prior to transport. This paper will describe the analysis and testing used to demonstrate that the Pipe Overpack Container provides safe on-site storage of plutonium bearing materials in unhardened buildings and provides criticality control during transportation within the TRUPACT-II. Analyses included worst-case criticality analyses, analyses of fork-lift time impacts, and analyses of roof structure collapse onto the container.

40|$|A {{section of}} {{submerged}} arc welded 864 mm diameter API 5 L grade X 65 gas pipeline containing known stress corrosion cracks (SCC) {{was selected for}} fatigue testing to determine whether SCC shallower than a certain depth could be recoated {{without the need for}} grinding and returned to service without the risk of later failing by fatigue. The SCC containing pipe section was removed from service, instrumented with strain gauges, fitted with proprietary glass reinforced plastic (GRP) repair sleeves (Clocksprings) at the location of some of the cracking, and hydrostatically pressure cycled under automatic control. After pressure cycling, SCC cracks were extracted from the pipeline and examined metallographically. The fatigue testing was terminated by a small leak after the equivalent of approximately 8000 years of daily and maintenance related pressure cycling for the pipeline concerned. This life exceeded the fatigue life of defect free as-welded joints for pipelines and structures according to the fatigue design rules of e. g. DIN and DNV standards respectively. The amount of fatigue crack growth extension caused by pressure cycles equivalent to 50 years of service proposed for the pipeline concerned was negligible on <b>bare</b> <b>pipe</b> and minuscule under the GRP sleeves. The measured fatigue crack growth rates were compared to a computer model based on the Standard BS 7910. The model tended to overestimate fatigue crack growth because the shape of the SCC cracks was far from ideal and because of complex crack interaction effects. The SCC cracks were inclined away from the perpendicular and had a range of configurations and crack aspect ratios different to typical fatigue crack characteristics. This added further complexity to the issue of predicting fatigue crack interaction and growth. The results of the testing show that if the SCC causing environment can be excluded from the pipe surface by effective re-coating, it is likely that SCC cracks small enough to be safely left in the pipeline under static pressure will not need to be removed by grinding and will not grow to critical levels by fatigue in normal gas pipeline service. This work has also shown that BS 7910 can provide a conservative fatigue crack growth estimate (when using the recommended values plus 2 standard deviations) for a gas pipeline containing SCC cracks rendered dormant.

To predict the diffusion area of spilled oil before it reaches the water’s surface and to reduce the time required for emergency response, numerical simulations were conducted on underwater spilled oil diffusion of <b>bare</b> crude oil <b>pipes</b> using FLUENT software. The influences of water-surface wind speed, leakage hole diameter, water velocity, and initial leakage velocity on oil diffusion were analyzed. The results revealed the following: (1) with wind blowing {{on the surface of}} the water, the vertical displacement of spilled oil jet-flow was affected by the combined action of water flow and wind, making it difficult for a high-speed jet-flow to form. A horizontal oil flow mostly moved in the direction of the bottom water, and frontier oil droplets dispersed quickly; (2) during the diffusion of spilled oil in water, the maximum horizontal displacement mostly increased linearly, while the maximum vertical displacement initially increased quickly and then slowed; (3) the greater the initial velocity and leakage hole diameter, the higher the oil jet-flow and the wider the diffusion area; the higher the water flow rate and water-surface wind speed, the smaller the vertical displacement of spilled oil. The existence of water-surface wind had no obvious influence on the horizontal displacement of underwater spilled oil.|$|R
40|$|Fatigue {{damage and}} drag force {{amplification}} due to Vortex-Induced-Vibrations (VIV) continue to cause significant {{problems in the}} design of structures which operate in ocean current environments. These problems are magnified by the uncertainty in VIV prediction, particularly with regard to fatigue damage. Although the last fifteen years has seen significant advancement in VIV prediction, important fatigue and drag related questions remain unanswered. This research addresses two important problems. The first is the difficulty in measuring local drag coefficients on long flexible cylinders, excited by VIV. At best engineers are forced to use spatially averaged drag coefficients. This is especially inaccurate when the pipe and flow properties change, either due to partial coverage with VIV mitigation devices, such as strakes or fairings, or shear in the incident current profile. The second problem is the lack of design procedures that account for the effect on fatigue damage due to the higher harmonics in the VIV strain response. To address these problems, two experiments were performed to collect data, the first in October of 2004 and the second in October of 2006. Both of these experiments were designed specifically to collect strain measurements from a densely instrumented pipe undergoing VIV at high mode numbers when subjected to current profiles with varying amounts of shear. Data from these experiments was used to develop a method to extract local drag forces from the measured mean strain. This method, when applied to a partially faired pipe undergoing VIV, successfully and accurately distinguished the dissimilar local drag coefficient between the <b>bare</b> <b>pipe</b> region and the region with fairings. In bare pipes, {{for the first time the}} method allowed for the measurement of the variation of local drag coefficient along the length of a flexible pipe undergoing VIV in sheared current. (cont.) Further by using filtering techniques, the higher harmonics were isolated and analyzed, particularly for their magnitude and phase response characteristics. Interesting features about the phase relationships between the first, second and third harmonics were observed when the primary VIV response was in the form of a traveling wave. Finally, data revealed some inaccuracies in the fatigue estimation techniques currently being used by the oil and gas industry. Two methods are suggested to incorporate the higher harmonics in VIV related fatigue design while correcting the observed inaccuracies in the current methods. The results revealed limitations in the commonly used, vibration-amplitude based methods of calculating local drag coefficients and may lead to modifications to correct these limitations. These findings also provide tools for researchers to include the higher harmonics in VIV related fatigue damage calculations and remove some of the uncertainty involved in VIV fatigue estimation and could lead to smaller safety factors in VIV fatigue design. by Vikas Gopal Jhingran.

40|$|When a {{pipeline}} is installed at deep waters the primary design load is the external pressure, hence making the collapse pressure the major design parameter. Pipeline collapse formulas are functions of elastic and plastic collaspe pressure acompanied the initial ovality and yield stress. The most common formulas for collapse are the Timoshenko, Shell and Haagsma equation where {{the latter is}} the least conservative and used in the offshore standard DNV-OS-F 101. In any pipeline system onshore or offshore {{there is a need}} of pipeline protection. The purpose of coating is to isolate the pipeline steel from the seawater, the soil and to introduce a high resistance path between anodic and cathodic areas. Such coatings can be ranging from a few up to around hundred millimeter, thus the cros section of the coated pipe can be many times initial cros section of the <b>bare</b> steel <b>pipe.</b> Existing design formulas for collapse are neglecting the effect of pipeline coating and a study is proposed to investigate if todays practice of neglecting the coating is ac- ceptable. In this project ABAQUS finite element software has been used to examine a coated pipe section with various thicknesses, elasticity and ovality and compared the collapse limit to the values of a uncoated pipe. Based on the assumption of elasticity and material model of coating the results has shown to increase the collapse capacity when the coating thickness and elasticity increases. The values has shown a increase in range of 5 to 25 %. The ovality of the coating however has shown to not effect the pipe collapse capacity in any significant way. Also based on a proposed simple analytical collapse model of serial resistance where the collapse capacity of the steel pipe is added to the collapse capacity of the coated pipe without the steel, the model has shown a good agreement with ABAQUS collapse data and thus is recommended for use in collapse calculation of coated pipelines.

40|$|Concentrating {{solar power}} (CSP) is {{increasingly}} considered because it facilitates harvesting {{a large amount}} of solar thermal energy. In order for CSP plants to be operationally cost competitive and efficient, they must be able to harvest and store the maximum solar thermal energy during the period of solar availability and to utilize the stored heat for continuous electrical power generation during times when the sun is not available. Hence, efficient and high-density thermal energy storage is an essential aspect of CSP system development. Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) systems can directly reduce the development costs of CSP plants, in terms of smaller installation space and reduced heat storage material requirements. However, the low thermal conductivities of phase change materials (PCMs) have limited their thermal potentials. This research focuses on increasing the overall thermal conductance of PCMs used in LHTES units through using heat pipes (HPs). Specifically, three new designs of LHTES units, which utilize HPs to enhance the energy transfer, were numerically and experimentally investigated. Three different numerical models along with three different experimental configurations were developed to assess the thermal performance of the proposed units. Also, a preliminary system sizing was conducted to estimate the size of each unit required for 50 MW electrical power output. After calculating the size of each unit, the units were economically assessed. Firstly, the advantages of utilising axially finned HPs in LHTES units were numerically and experimentally quantified. The experimental measurements were conducted on a <b>bare</b> heat <b>pipe</b> and on an identical heat pipe with four axial fins. The results have shown that the energy extracted from the PCM increased by 86 % and the heat pipes effectiveness increased by 24 %. Secondly, finned heat pipes were held, in suspension, adjacent to the heat transfer channel in order to increase the overall heat conductance of the PCM and act as effective heat spreaders. The results have shown that the effectiveness of the twelve-heat pipe configuration reached 2. 4 after 5 h of simulated operation. Thirdly, the thermal performance of a micro heat pipe-phase change material (MHP-PCM) composite was studied. A 3 D numerical model was introduced to firstly predict the effective thermal conductivity of MHPs-PCM composites, and secondly to simulate heat transfer and phase change processes in a high-temperature LHTES unit. The model takes into consideration the effects of the MHP orientation as well as the MHP volume fraction. The results have shown that the thermal conductivity increased by approximately 35 times at a MHP volume fraction of 10 %. Finally, the last portion of this research focused on size estimation of each of the designs proposed in Chapters 4 and 5. Economic assessments of each design are then presented. Compared with the existing two-tank system, the capital cost of the unit presented in Chapter 4 was found to be 8 % lesser. In contrast, the unit presented in Chapter 5 is found to be significantly more expensive than the two-tank system. That is, its total cost was found to be 5. 6 times higher than the two-tank system...|$|R
