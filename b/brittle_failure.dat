Analysis of seismic waves suggest that the earthquake swarm was caused by <b>brittle</b> <b>failure</b> and fracturing of rock at depth from magma intrusion.

Nevertheless, this suggests that the Anahim hotspot is seismically active and that small magma movements are still possible.

As expected, the tensile strength was gradually decreased with increasing temperature due to the ease of plastic deformation at these temperatures. However, the failure strain gradually decreased from room temperature to 600 °C, possibly due to the occurrence of a phenomenon known as dynamic strain aging.
