40|$|More than 1000 {{expectant}} {{mothers in}} Papua New Guinea will receive <b>Birthing</b> <b>Kits</b> {{through the work}} and dedication of Medicine students at The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Sydney Campus. The initiative was inspired by <b>Birthing</b> <b>Kit</b> Foundation (Australia), an organisation dedicated to improving the conditions of women who give birth at home in developing countries. The Medical Association of Notre Dame University Sydney (MANDUS), along with the School’s Global Health and Social Justice sub-committee, collaborated to assemble the <b>Birthing</b> <b>Kits</b> on Saturday, July 23. Each <b>Birthing</b> <b>Kit</b> includes six items – a plastic sheet, soap, two gloves, a sterile scalpel blade, three cords and five gauze squares. President of MANDUS, Brent Doolan, says the challenging environment of postnatal care for people in developing countries can result in extreme discomfort for the mother and her baby. Mr Doolan says that in some regions of Papua New Guinea {{it is not uncommon}} for the umbilical cord to be cut with a sharpened sea shell or a metal blade. “With an estimated 385, 000 women dying annually in childbirth, many from infections acquired during the process, there is a great need for our clean Birthing Kits,” Mr Doolan said. “We wish to assist by educating expectant mothers on birth practices and work alongside the World Health Organisation’s millennium development goals by helping to improve maternal health internationally. “As future doctors, it is fundamental for us to understand the improvements that we can accomplish in the developing world. I think this brings our medical students one step closer to this end goal. ” Dean of the School of Medicine in Sydney, Dr Christine Bennett, supported the <b>Birthing</b> <b>Kits</b> initiative of the Notre Dame medical students. “We are very proud of Notre Dame’s Medicine students and their commitment to making a practical difference to those in need,” Dr Bennett said. “This <b>Birthing</b> <b>Kit</b> initiative is about rolling their sleeves up and taking action that will, in partnership with the <b>Birthing</b> <b>Kit</b> Foundation (Australia), have a real impact on the health of women and babies in Papua New Guinea. ” Media Contact: Leigh Dawson (+ 61) 8 9433 0569, Mob (+ 61) 0405 441 09...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Clean birth {{practices}} {{can prevent}} sepsis, {{one of the}} leading causes of both maternal and newborn mortality. Evidence suggests that clean birth kits (CBKs), as part of package that includes education, are associated with a reduction in newborn mortality, omphalitis, and puerperal sepsis. However, questions remain about how best to approach the introduction of CBKs in country. We set out to develop a practical decision support tool for programme managers of public health systems who are considering the potential role of CBKs in their strategy for care at birth. Methods Development and testing of the decision support tool was a three-stage process involving an international expert group and country level testing. Stage 1, the development of the tool was undertaken by the <b>Birth</b> <b>Kit</b> Working Group and involved a review of the evidence, a consensus meeting, drafting of the proposed tool and expert review. In Stage 2 the tool was tested with users through interviews (9) and a focus group, with federal and provincial level decision makers in Pakistan. In Stage 3 the findings from the country level testing were reviewed by the expert group. Results The decision support tool comprised three separate algorithms to guide the policy maker or programme manager through the specific steps required in making the country level decision about whether to use CBKs. The algorithms were supported by a series of questions (that could be administered by interview, focus group or questionnaire) to help the decision maker identify the information needed. The country level testing revealed that the decision support tool was easy to follow and helpful in making decisions about the potential role of CBKs. Minor modifications were made and the final algorithms are presented. Conclusion Testing of the tool with users in Pakistan suggests that the tool facilitates discussion and aids decision making. However, testing in other countries is needed to determine whether these results can be replicated and to identify how the tool can be adapted to meet country specific needs. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background:Umbilical cord {{infection}} (omphalitis) is a {{risk factor}} for neonatal sepsis and mortality in low-resource settings where home deliveries are common. We aimed to assess the effect of umbilical-cord cleansing with 4 % chlorhexidine (CHX) solution, with or without handwashing with antiseptic soap, on the incidence of omphalitis and neonatal mortality. Methods: We did a two-by-two factorial, cluster-randomised trial in Dadu, a rural area of Sindh province, Pakistan. Clusters were defined as the population covered by a functional traditional birth attendant (TBA), and were randomly allocated to one of four groups (groups A to D) with a computer-generated random number sequence. Implementation and data collection teams were masked to allocation. Liveborn infants delivered by participating TBAs who received <b>birth</b> <b>kits</b> were eligible for enrolment in the study. One intervention comprised <b>birth</b> <b>kits</b> containing 4 % CHX solution for application to the cord at birth by TBAs and once daily by family members for up to 14 days along with soap and educational messages promoting hand washing. One intervention was CHX solution only and another was handwashing only. Standard dry cord care was promoted in the control group. The primary outcomes were incidence of neonatal omphalitis and neonatal mortality. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00682006. Findings: 187 clusters were randomly allocated to one of the four study groups. Of 9741 newborn babies delivered by participating TBAs, factorial analysis indicated a reduction in risk of omphalitis with CHX application (risk ratio [RR]= 0. 58, 95 % CI 0. 41 - 0. 82, p= 0. 002) but no evidence of an effect of handwashing (RR= 0. 83, 0. 61 - 1. 13, p= 0. 24). We recorded strong evidence of a reduction in neonatal mortality in neonates who received CHX cleansing (RR= 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 45 - 0. 85, p= 0. 003) but no evidence of an effect of handwashing promotion on neonatal mortality (RR= 1. 08, 0. 79 - 1. 48, p= 0. 62). We recorded no serious adverse events. Interpretation: Application of 4 % CHX to the umbilical cord was effective in reducing the risk of omphalitis and neonatal mortality in rural Pakistan.

25|$|The {{reproductive}} {{physiology of}} the black-footed ferret {{is similar to}} that of the European polecat and the steppe polecat. It is probably polygynous, based on data collected from home range sizes, skewed sex ratios, and sexual dimorphism. Mating occurs in February and March. When a male and female in estrus encounter each other, the male sniffs the genital region of the female, but does not mount her until after a few hours have elapsed, which is contrast to the more violent behavior displayed by the male European polecat. During copulation, the male grasps the female by the nape of the neck, with the copulatory tie lasting from 1.5–3 hours. Unlike other mustelids, the black-footed ferret is a habitat specialist with low reproductive rates. In captivity, gestation of black-footed ferrets lasts 42–45 days. Litter size ranges from 1–5 kits. Kits are born in May and June in prairie dog burrows. Kits are altricial and are raised by their mother for several months after <b>birth.</b> <b>Kits</b> first emerge above ground in July, at 6 weeks old.

At <b>birth,</b> <b>kits</b> were allocated into 4 groups: HS was only applied during gestation (G group; n= 54); HS was applied during gestation and lactation period (GL group; n= 85); HS was only applied during lactation period (L group; n= 60); and TN was applied during gestation and lactation period (C group; n= 77). All litters were kept under each experimental environment until weaning at day 30.  Then, litters were moved to TN temperatures until slaughter at day 63. Compared with TN does, the HS does presented lower litter size (9. 7 and 11. 4; P< 0. 05), litter weight (503. 0 vs. 630. 5 g; P< 0. 05) and <b>kit</b> weight at <b>birth</b> (56. 6 vs. 61. 4 g; P< 0. 05), as well as a higher stillborn rate (25. 4 vs. 9. 9 %; P< 0. 05). The kits from does subjected to HS during gestation (G group) had similar postnatal growth compared to offspring from does gestated in TN conditions (C group), whereas kits from does that experienced HS during gestation and lactation (GL group) and during their lactation (L group) presented decreased postnatal growth. Together, these results demonstrate that kits from does that underwent HS during gestation did not alter postnatal growth until Spanish commercial liveweight, whereas HS during lactation resulted in decreased postnatal growth...|$|R
500|$|The female raises its kits {{without help}} from the male. They are [...] in weight at <b>birth.</b> Newborn <b>kits</b> are born pink, naked, blind and deaf, but gain a white coat of downy fur {{at the age of}} 4 days. At 10 days, the margin between the dark upper parts and light under parts becomes visible. The milk teeth erupt at 2 to 3 weeks of age, at which point the young start to eat solid food, though {{lactation}} can last 12 weeks. The eyes and ears open at 3 to 4 weeks of age, and by 8 weeks, killing behaviour is developed. The family breaks up after 9 to 12 weeks. There is a single litter each year and least weasels can live for 7 or 8 years.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Fireheart's best friend, Graystripe, risks {{the trust}} of his entire Clan as he {{continues}} having a forbidden love affair with Silverstream, who is from RiverClan. Fireheart and Graystripe face danger from Tigerclaw, who has noticed Graystripe missing from camp many times. Silverstream eventually dies while giving <b>birth</b> to Graystripe's <b>kits</b> when they come early. Graystripe is left heartbroken. ThunderClan then learns about his forbidden love with Silverstream and feel that they cannot trust Graystripe anymore.|$|R
50|$|Researchers {{believe that}} the {{reproductive}} behavior of the yellow-bellied weasel {{is similar to that}} of the short-tailed weasel (Mustela erminea). Yellow-bellied weasels first build a den in the ground. Breeding occurs annually. Mating occurs in late spring or early summer. Females are pregnant for about ten months. The female gives <b>birth</b> to 3-18 <b>kits</b> in April or May. By the time the kits are eight weeks old, they are ready to go out and hunt on their own.|$|R
50|$|The 21st Phantom's <b>birth</b> name is <b>Kit</b> Walker, as was {{the name}} of many of the Phantoms before him. Kit was born in the Skull Cave, and spent his first years in the jungle of Bengalla.

50|$|Cottontails give <b>birth</b> {{to their}} <b>kits</b> in burrows vacated by other mammals. They {{sometimes}} cool off, or {{take refuge in}} scratched out shallow created depressions of their own making, using their front paws like a back hoe. They are not usually active {{in the middle of}} the day, but can be observed foraging in the early morning, and early evening. Cottontails are rarely found out of their burrows looking for food on windy days, because the wind interferes with their ability to hear approaching predators, their primary defense mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The European polecat is a {{seasonal}} breeder, with no courtship rituals. During the mating season, the male grabs the female {{by the neck}} and drags her about to stimulate ovulation, then copulates for up to an hour. The species is polygamous, with each male polecat mating with several females. Unlike with other small mustelids, ovulation is not induced, and pregnancy occurs immediately after mating. The gestation period lasts 40-43 days, with litters usually being born in May-early June. Each litter typically consists of five to 10 <b>kits.</b> At <b>birth,</b> the <b>kits</b> weigh 9-10 g and measure 55-70 mm in body length; they are blind and deaf. At the age of one week, the kits are covered in silky, white fur, which is replaced with a cinnamon brown-greyish woolly coat {{at the age of}} 3-4 wk. Weaning begins at three weeks of age, while the permanent dentition erupts after 7-8 wk. The kits become independent after two to three months. Females are very protective of their young, and have even been known to confront humans approaching too closely to their litters.|$|R
40|$|Quality {{improvement}} is a recommended strategy to improve implementation levels for evidence-based essential interventions, but experience of and evidence for its effects in low-resource settings are limited. We hypothesised that a systemic and collaborative quality improvement approach covering district, facility and community levels, supported by report cards generated through continuous household and health facility surveys, could improve the implementation levels {{and have a}} measurable population-level impact on coverage and quality of essential services. Collaborative quality improvement teams tested self-identified strategies (change ideas) to support the implementation of essential maternal and newborn interventions recommended by the World Health Organization. In Tanzania and Uganda, we used a plausibility design to compare the changes over time in one intervention district with those in a comparison district in each country. Evaluation included indicators of process, coverage and implementation practice analysed with a difference-of-differences and a time-series approach, using data from independent continuous household and health facility surveys from 2011 to 2014. Primary outcomes for both countries were birth in health facilities, breastfeeding within 1  h after birth, oxytocin administration after birth and knowledge of danger signs for mothers and babies. Interpretation of the results considered contextual factors. The intervention was associated with improvements on one of four primary outcomes. We observed a 26 -percentage-point increase (95 % CI 25 - 28 %) {{in the proportion of}} live births where mothers received uterotonics within 1  min after birth in the intervention compared to the comparison district in Tanzania and an 8 -percentage-point increase (95 % CI 6 - 9 %) in Uganda. The other primary indicators showed no evidence of improvement. In Tanzania, we saw positive changes for two other outcomes reflecting locally identified improvement topics. The intervention was associated with an increase in preparation of clean <b>birth</b> <b>kits</b> for home deliveries (31 percentage points, 95 % CI 2 - 60 %) and an increase in health facility supervision by district staff (14 percentage points, 95 % CI 0 - 28 %). The systemic quality improvement approach was associated with improvements of only one of four primary outcomes, as well as two Tanzania-specific secondary outcomes. Reasons for the lack of effects included limited implementation strength as well a relatively short follow-up period in combination with a 1 -year recall period for population-based estimates and a limited power of the study to detect changes smaller than 10 percentage points...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Six {{hundred and}} forty nutrias, Myocastor coypus (Molina), were {{collected}} near Corvallis, Oregon, and examined to determine criteria of their growth and reproduction. Two hundred and eighty-nine were tagged, measured, and released to determine growth under natural conditions. Nutria weights were calculated {{to the nearest}} 0. 1 pound by weighing the live-trapped animals in the trap arid subtracting {{the weight of the}} trap following their release. Total lengths, right hind foot lengths, and body lengths were measured in inches while the nutrias were restrained within a holding chute. Three hundred and fifty-one nutrias were sacrificed during the investigation and examined internally for criteria of growth, reproductive status and presence of diseases. In addition, the weights of the adrenals, kidneys, liver, heart, and air-dried skulls, were recorded in grams. Smears taken from some of the testes were stained and examined for the presence of spermatozoa. Ovaries were examined for corpora lutea and uterine tracts for pregnancies. Mean weight at birth for the nutria kits was 217 grams. No appreciable differences were determined in body measurements between the sexes. Body weights of maximal sized males and nulliparous females were 24. 0 and 16. 0 pounds respectively. Sexual maturity was attained in Oregon nutria from 6 to 9 months of age in males and from 4 to 9 months of age in females. Mean body weights at the onset of sexual maturity for males and females were 6. 1 and 4. 1 pounds respectively. Peak birth periods occurred in January, March, and May. A lesser peak occurred in October. Litters averaged 5. 0 <b>kits</b> at <b>birth</b> with a 1 : 1 sex ratio. Prenatal mortality was observed in 24. 6 percent of the 60 pregnancies examined. Gravida after resorption averaged 4. 9 fetuses per female. Based upon 55 pairs of ovaries, 7. 6 corpora lutea were observed per ovary. Differences between corpora lutea and the fetuses that survived prenatal mortality indicated a total embryonic loss of about 33 to 35 percent. Weaning occurred in feral kits 7 weeks after <b>birth.</b> <b>Kits</b> forcibly weaned when 2 to 8 weeks old survived hut grew at somewhat slower rates than normal kits. Nine kits, less than 1 week old when forcibly weaned, suffered a depleted condition and six of them died...|$|R
