25|$|Pressure-sensitive tape, PSA tape, {{adhesive}} tape, self-stick tape, or sticky tape {{consists of}} a pressure-sensitive adhesive coated onto a <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> such as paper, plastic film, cloth, or metal foil.

25|$|Quilting is {{the process}} of sewing two or more layers of fabric {{together}} to make a thicker padded material, usually to create a quilt or quilted garment. Typically, quilting is done with three layers: the top fabric or quilt top, batting or insulating material and <b>backing</b> <b>material,</b> but many different styles are adopted.|$|E

25|$|These are carpets {{that have}} their pile {{injected}} into a <b>backing</b> <b>material,</b> which is itself then bonded to a secondary backing {{made of a}} woven hessian weave or a man made alternative to provide stability.

25|$|Filament tape or {{strapping}} tape is a {{pressure-sensitive tape}} used for several packaging {{functions such as}} closing corrugated fiberboard boxes, reinforcing packages, bundling items, pallet utilizing, etc. It consists of a pressure-sensitive adhesive coated onto a <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> which is usually a polypropylene or polyester film and fiberglass filaments embedded to add high tensile strength. Filament tape was invented in 1946 by Cyrus Woodrow Bemmels. In 1949, it {{was placed on the}} market and was an immediate success.|$|E
25|$|Because the ammolite {{layer is}} usually mere {{fractions}} of a millimeter in thickness, most ammolite gems {{are in fact}} composite stones: these usually {{take the form of}} two-part doublets, with the ammolite layer adhered to a dark <b>backing</b> <b>material.</b> This is usually the matrix or mother rock from which the ammolite was quarried; black onyx or glass could also be used as backing. In composites where the ammolite layer is exceptionally thin, a third component is used: this constitutes a triplet, with a durable and transparent convex topping piece. This cap may be either synthetic spinel, synthetic corundum, synthetic quartz, or in lower-end productions, glass. The convex cap acts as a lens and has the effect of enhancing the ammolite's iridescent display.|$|E

2500|$|Adhesive lift: [...] in this method, a {{sheet of}} fixing film is used to {{preserve}} the developed indentations. [...] The fixing film is usually a relatively rigid sheet of self-adhesive, transparent polymer film. [...] It is applied by removing the <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> and carefully laying the fixing film directly onto the charging film, thus trapping and fixing the toner in place between the films. [...] Pressure is then carefully applied {{to the top of}} the fixing film by hand or with a small roller. [...] The resulting sandwich is referred to simply as a [...] "lift", or EDD lift. [...] Interpretation of the developed indentations is generally done using the lift after removal from the document because this permits the examiner to see the developed indentations on their own without interference from any visible markings on the document.|$|E
2500|$|Carpets can be {{produced}} on a loom quite similar to woven fabric, made using needle felts, knotted by hand (in oriental rugs), made with their pile injected into a <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> (called tufting), flatwoven, made by hooking wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric or embroidered. Carpet is commonly made in widths of [...] and [...] in the USA, 4m and 5m in Europe. Since the 20th century, where necessary for wall-to-wall carpet, different widths of carpet can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was sewn together) and fixed to a floor over a cushioned underlay (pad) using nails, tack strips (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal stair rods. Wall-to-wall carpet is distinguished from rugs or mats, which are loose-laid floor coverings, as wall-to-wall carpet is fixed {{to the floor and}} covers a much larger area.|$|E

40|$|Many {{single or}} multispan arch bridges are {{strengthened}} {{with the addition}} of some kind of structural support between adjacent arches of multispan or beside the arch barrel of a single span to increase the strength of the overall structure. It was traditionally formed by either placing loose rubble masonry blocks between the arches and beside the arches or using mortar or concrete to construct a more substantial structural bond between the spans. On the other hand <b>backing</b> <b>materials</b> are present in some existing bridges. Existing arch assessment procedures generally ignore the effects of <b>backing</b> <b>materials.</b> In this paper an investigation of the effects of backing on ratings for masonry arch bridges is carried out. It is observed that increasing the overall lateral stability of the arch system through the inclusion of structural backing results in an enhanced failure load by reducing the likelihood of any tension occurring {{at the top of the}} arch...|$|R

5000|$|One of the {{critical}} requirements in soft ballistic testing is measurement of [...] "back side signature" [...] (i.e. energy delivered to tissue by a non-penetrating projectile) in a deformable <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> placed behind the targeted vest. The majority of military and law enforcement standards have settled on an oil/clay mixture for the <b>backing</b> <b>material,</b> known as Roma Plastilena. [...] Although harder and less deformable than human tissue, Roma represents a “worst case” <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> when plastic deformations in the oil/clay are low (less than 20 mm). (Armor placed over a harder surface is more easily penetrated.) The oil/clay mixture of [...] "Roma" [...] is roughly twice the density of human tissue and therefore does not match its specific gravity, however [...] "Roma" [...] is a plastic material that will not recover its shape elastically, which is important for accurately measuring potential trauma through back side signature.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFront-face {{acoustic}} reflectivity of {{ultrasonic imaging}} transducers, due to acoustic impedance mismatch with the propagation medium, may cause reverberation phenomena during wideband pulse-echo operation. Front-face reflectivity {{may be reduced}} by promoting the transmission of the echoes, received from the medium, to the transducer backing, and by maximizing the mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion and dissipation by tuning the electrical load impedance connected to the transducer. In Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUTs), the energy transfer from the medium to the backing is very low due to the large impedance mismatch between the medium and the transducer substrate, typically made of silicon. Reverse Fabrication Process (RFP) makes it possible providing CMUTs with custom substrate materials, thus eliminating the original silicon microfabrication support. In this paper, we propose two methods for the front-face reflectivity reduction in RFP-CMUTs: {{the first one is}} based on the use of low-impedance, highly attenuating <b>backing</b> <b>materials,</b> and the second one is based on the maximization of the mechanoelectrical energy conversion and dissipation. We analyze the methods by finite element simulations and experimentally validate the obtained results by fabricating and characterizing single-element RFP-CMUTs provided with different <b>backing</b> <b>materials</b> and electrical loads...|$|R
