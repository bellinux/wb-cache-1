40|$|Abstract: To {{protect the}} display effects in {{flexible}} displays a <b>brittle</b> <b>coating</b> {{is required to}} prevent air and water from reaching the display effect. The problem of the <b>brittle</b> <b>coating</b> {{is that it is}} not able to withstand high levels of stress. Since the most important aspect of a flexible displays is being ‘rollable’, the brittle layer will be very often subjected to compressive stress. To get a better insight of the resilience of the <b>brittle</b> <b>coating</b> against stress, residual stress and critical stress measurements where done. In addition, the buckle propagation was studied, which is the result of compressive stress. The buckle was continually growing in width, while increasing in length showed more jumping. Every time after the buckle had jumped, the new buckle top only increased to a certain width, after which it made a new “jump ” and the cycle started again. If exposed for a longer time, the buckle stopped growing, and then jumped over the entire substrate width. The experiments were also preformed on substrates with different material systems, to determine the influence of the substrate thickness and the <b>brittle</b> <b>coating</b> thickness...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanical}} properties of <b>brittle</b> <b>coating</b> structures {{were characterized by}} various indentation techniques. The adhesion properties of the coatings were evaluated by in situ scratch and sphere indentation method. Physical vapor deposited TiN coatings on transparent substrates, sapphire, were scratched by diamond cone indenter and in situ observed through the transparent substrate. In situ scratch results reveal that the failure of coating is originated from the damage of the substrate and the plastic deformation of substrate is a primary factor for determining the adhesion breakage. The unique characterization technique for the strength measurement of brittle thin coating has been developed. The strength of the thin coating was evaluated by the sphere indentation on the trilayer structure. The CVD SiC coatings on graphite were characterized by the technique. It is concluded that the microstructure of SiC coatings influences the strength. In this paper, the various indentation technique were applied to evaluate the {{mechanical properties}} of TiN and SiC coatings {{and the effect of}} microstructure on the reliability of the <b>brittle</b> <b>coating</b> system was discussed...|$|E

This study describes {{the generation of}} a high load capacity pellet formulation for sustained release of a freely water-soluble dairy-derived hydrolysate, FHI- 2571. The activity of this novel peptidic ghrelin receptor agonist is reported using in vitro calcium mobilization assays. Conventional extrusion spheronization was then used to prepare peptide-loaded pellets which were subsequently coated with ethylcellulose (EC) film coats using a fluid bed coating system in bottom spray (Wurster) mode. Aqueous-based EC coating dispersions produced mechanically <b>brittle</b> <b>coats</b> which fractured due to osmotic pressure build-up within pellets in simulated media. In contrast, an ethanolic-based EC coating solution provided robust, near zero-order release in both USP Type 1 and Type 4 dissolution studies. Interestingly, the functionality of aqueous-based EC film coats was restored by first layering pellets with a methacrylic acid copolymer (MA) subcoat, thereby hindering pellet core swelling in acidic media. Broadband Acoustic Resonance Dissolution Spectroscopy (BARDS) was utilised as a complementary technique to confirm the results seen in USP dissolution studies. Retention of activity of the ghrelinergic peptide hydrolysate in the final encapsulated product was confirmed as being greater than 80 %. The described pellet formulation is amenable to oral dosing in small animal studies {{in order to assess}} in vivo efficacy of the whey-derived ghrelinergic hydrolysate.

40|$|The {{isothermal}} fatigue {{behavior of}} a high-activity aluminide-coated single-crystal superalloy was studied in air at test temperatures of 600 °C, 800 °C, and 1000 °C. Tests were performed using cylindrical specimens under strain control at ∼ 0. 25 Hz; total strain ranges from 0. 5 to 1. 6 pet were investigated. At 600 °C, crack initiation occurred at <b>brittle</b> <b>coating</b> cracks, {{which led to a}} significant reduction in fatigue life compared to the uncoated alloy. Fatigue cracks grew from the <b>brittle</b> <b>coating</b> cracks initially in a stage II manner with a subsequent transition to crystallographic stage I fatigue. At 800 °C and 1000 °C, the coating failed quickly by a fatigue process due to the drastic reduction in strength above 750 °C, the ductile-brittle transition temperature. These cracks were arrested or slowed by oxidation at the coating-substrate interface and only led to a detriment in life relative to the uncoated material for total strain ranges of 1. 2 pet and above 800 °C. The presence of the coating was beneficial at 800 °C for total strain rangesless than 1. 2 pet. No effect of the coating was observed at 1000 °C.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the microstructure of the interfaces on the mechanical behaviour of unidirectional T 800 carbon fibres /Al - 4. 5 Mg matrix composites is investigated to optimize the composite performances. Three composites were selected. In two of them, a fibre coating was introduced by LPCVD. The coating was composed of pyrolytic carbon (Cp) or of a Cp/ Sic bilayer. As already known, a brittle Al 4 C 3 interphase (≈ 300 nm large) is formed by fibre-matrix reaction at the T 800 /Al interface. The composite is weak (450 MPa) and <b>brittle.</b> The Cp <b>coating</b> (≈ 100 nm) exhibits a turbostratic structure similar to the fibre one. However, it does not react with the matrix. The composite is stronger (1400 MPa) and tough. The bilayered coating is made of a layer (≈ 100 nm) of turbostratic carbon next to the fibre and of a layer (50 - 200 nm) of small (20 nm) β-SiC grains. Some reaction occurs between the Sic coating and the matrix resulting in magnesium silicide (Mg 2 Si) and Al 4 C 3. The composite exhibits an intermediate mechanical behaviour (740 MPa and very little pull out). As a result, it appears that <b>brittle</b> interphases (<b>coating</b> or reaction layer) are detrimental to the mechanical behaviour of the composites. Their influence depends on their composition but also of their granulometry. The Cp coating has a beneficent effect on the mechanical behaviour because it prevents {{the formation of a}} brittle interphase and decreases the failure resistance at the interface...|$|R

By using the comprehensive experimental/computational framework, the nucleation process (mechanism) of such a complicate crack system was clarified.

At large coating thicknesses (> 300 mm), the first damage takes the form of surface-initiated transverse cone cracks outside the contact. At small coating thicknesses (< 300 mm), the first damage occurs as yield in the substrate, with attendant formation of subsurface transverse median cracks in the coating. At high loads and thin coatings, both forms of transverse cracking occur, along with subsequent delamination of the ceramic/metal interface, signalling impending failure. Conditions for avoiding such transverse cracking are considered in terms of minimum coating thicknesses and maximum sustainable contact loads.

Influences of laser remelting on the microstructure and solid particle erosion {{characterization of the}} coatings were researched. Meanwhile, the erosion damage modes of {{the two types of}} TBCs were discussed. The results show that the as-sprayed TBC has a typical lamellar stacking characteristic. The lamellar defect of the plasma-sprayed coating is erased, and the compactness of the coating is improved significantly after laser remelting. The laser-remelted coating consists of column-like crystals along the direction of the heat current. The laser-remelted coating had better erosion resistance than the as-sprayed coating. Owing to the limited bonding at the interfaces between lamellar, the spalling of the sprayed splats from the lamellar interface is mainly attributed to the erosion failure of the as-sprayed coating. In addition, crushing of <b>brittle</b> ceramic <b>coating</b> is also responsible for the erosion damage of the plasma-sprayed TBC. In contrast, cracking occurs within region near the surface of the laser-remelted layer and that erosion occurs mainly by removal of these small blocks.

Materials and Methods: Rats received a nitinol implant, an SS implant or were sham controls. Two, 3, 6 and 8 weeks following implantation 24 -hour voiding behavior studies were per-formed to investigate bladder irritation. All animals were sacrificed 8 weeks after implantation and a sample of urine was aspirated for culture. The bladders were examined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: No visible encrustations or infections were noted in urine. Voiding frequency in the light period 6 weeks after implantation was significantly decreased in the 2 implant groups compared with sham controls. There were no other significant differences in frequency or mean volume per void in the light or dark periods at any time point. Light microscopy demonstrated similar implant tissue effects in all groups {{with little or no}} inflammation or fibrosis. Under SEM all implants showed a <b>brittle,</b> amorphous <b>coating</b> devoid of cells. The transition between the urothelium, mucosa and the rod was smoother for SS than for nitinol, suggesting an affinity of SS for mucosa.

40|$|A {{study is}} made {{of the role of}} flaw state on the {{strength}} properties of <b>brittle</b> ceramic <b>coating</b> layers bonded to soft polycarbonate substrates. We introduce Vickers radial cracks at prescribed loads into the coating undersurfaces prior to bonding to control the sizes and locations of the starting flaws. A spherical indenter is then loaded on the top bilayer surfaces, directly above the Vickers indentation sites, subjecting the radial cracks to flexural tensile stress. Radial crack responses are monitored in situ, using a camera located below the transparent substrate. Critical loads to cause radial crack instability, and ensuing growth of the arrested cracks, are recorded. Conventional biaxial flexure tests on corresponding monolith coating materials provide a baseline for data com-parison. Relative to the monolith flexure specimens, the bilay-ers show higher strengths, the more so the larger the flaw, indicating enhanced flaw tolerance. A simple fracture mechan-ics analysis of the radial crack evolution in the concentrated-load field, with due account for distribution of flexural tensile stresses at the coating undersurface, is unable to account completely for the enhanced bilayer strengths for the larger Vickers flaws. It is hypothesized that the epoxy used to bond the bilayer components enters the cracks, causing crack-wall adherence and providing an increased resistance to radial crack instability. The fracture mechanics are nevertheless able to account for the arrest and subsequent stable extension of the radial cracks beyond the critical loads once this extraneous adherence has been overcome.

40|$|AbstractConcrete {{structures}} are often reinforced with steel. In {{order for the}} reinforcement to take over tensile forces, concrete has to crack. Through such cracks, water and compounds that are harmful to concrete can enter. This can cause durability issues like leakage, concrete degradation and reinforcement corrosion. In situ repair of cracks is often labour-intensive and inefficient. Preferentially, cracks are autonomously healed {{from the inside out}} in an early stage, preventing the ingress of water. This can be achieved by incorporating healing agent particles composed of nutrients and bacterial spores into the concrete matrix. The bacteria will germinate when water is available, plugging cracks with calcium carbonate. However, a coating is needed to protect the water-soluble healing agent from water during mixing. In order to allow the bacteria access to water for activation after the concrete has hardened, such a coating should break whenever a crack occurs in the concrete. Therefore, it should adhere well to the concrete matrix. It is possible to achieve this by protecting the particles with a <b>brittle</b> geopolymer <b>coating.</b> For this study, healing agent particles are coated with geopolymers following different mixture recipes. Metakaolin is used as an aluminosilicate source and sodium silicate as well as sodium aluminate are used as activator liquids. The particles are coated by granulation in a low-shear granulator. In order to improve the coating process, the operating window and the granulation mechanism are determined for all activator liquids used. Leaching and strength tests are performed and coated particles are incorporated in cement paste {{in order to determine the}} feasibility of application of the particles in concrete. Results show that the prepared particles are better protected from leaching than untreated particles. Using a high pressure single-fluid nozzle to improve nebulisation when coating produces more particles of the desired size than coating with a low pressure single-fluid nozzle with poor nebulisation. Furthermore, particles prepared with a high pressure nozzle sprayer perform better when incorporated into cement paste than particles prepared with a low pressure nozzle sprayer...|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{structure}} {{are designed}} to be able for providing an optimum service towards influences or forces both from the outside and also from inside of the structure. These influences and forces are the caused, which the structure will result in a failure such as cracking, concrete degradation, and reinforcement corrosion. Concrete cracking are consist of hair cracks and structural cracks. Hair cracks are most likely caused from concrete drying process, while structure cracks are mostly caused by errors on planning and also because of poor implementation. Concrete degradation is the process of reduction in concrete strength, which is increasingly lower than its concrete capacity. Reinforcement corrosion is caused from the process of concrete weathering around the reinforcement, which directly influence the dimension of the reinforcement. To implement concrete structure refinement technology, detection, observation, evaluation, and analysis are required to be done. Wherein the first indication is emphasized on concrete cracking, whether it was a new or old cracks and the type of the cracks. Aside from that concrete weathering also needs to be checked. The instruments used are sound test, rebound hammer, and ultrasonic pulse velocity test. To determine crack width, crack compactor, <b>brittle</b> liquid <b>coating</b> and linear variable differential transformer are used. Here strength of the concrete also needs to be determining by hammer test and core drill system. Concrete structure refinement technology, aside from considering the mean of its improvement, is also highly dependent on the damage. The aims of this technology are to increase the capacity and improve the performance of the structure. Aimed at concrete weathering refinement, the damage part is removed for then replaced with new concrete mixture. The substitute concrete can be from dry packing, mortar, grouting, shot crating, and pre packed concrete. For the active cracks type, the technologies to be used are painting and concrete injection. Similarly if the analysis result is require replacing the reinforcement, replacement should be performed including the possibility of adding concrete reinforcement. ...|$|R

Three types of precrack were studied: narrow precracks formed at room temperature, wide precracks formed at room temperature, and narrow precracks formed at elevated temperature. The effect of precracking on fatigue life at 600 °C was found to depend strongly {{on the type of}} precrack. No failure was observed for specimens with narrow room-temperature precracks because of crack arrest via an oxidation-induced crack closure mechanism, while the behavior of wide precracks and precracks formed at elevated temperature mirrored the non-precracked behavior. Crack retardation also occurred for narrow room-temperature precracks tested at 800 °C - in this case, fatigue cracks leading to failure initiated in a layer of recrystallized grains on the inside surface of the specimen. A significant reduction in fatigue life at 800 °C relative to non-precracked specimens was observed for wide precracks and elevated temperature precracks. The presence of precracks bypassed the initiation and growth of coating fatigue cracks necessary for failure in non-precracked material. No effect of precracking was observed at 1000 °C...|$|E
40|$|Electroless Ni-P {{coatings}} were {{deposited on}} mild steel substrates {{and the effect}} of heat-treatment on their structure and tensile behaviour was studied, with the following conclusions. The as-deposited electroless Ni-P coating is amorphous and it remains amorphous up to 300 degrees C. At 400 degrees C the coating becomes crystalline and consists of a Ni 3 P matrix containing areas of metallic nickel. For the selected coating/substrate thickness ratio, the contribution of the coating in the tensile properties of the coating-substrate system is negligible as expressed by the values of yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and fracture strain in mild steel substrates and coated as-deposited and heat-treated specimens. Extensive cracking of the coating accompanied by spalling was occurred during the tensile tests. The density of cracks was found to increase close to the fracture surface of the tensile specimen and with increasing heat-treatment temperature. The cracks observed {{on the surface of the}} coatings are believed to form due to the inability of the <b>brittle</b> <b>coating</b> to accommodate the strain generated in the ductile substrate. Their orientation to the tensile axis is in close relation to the structure of the coating and the failure mechanism that is dictated by this structure. The first cracks on the surface of the coatings were found to form after the yield strength of the tensile specimen has been reached and plastic deformation of the substrate takes place. Their density increases with the accumulation of strain up to fracture. (C) 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Surface {{treatments}} of the titanium alloys are frequently applied {{in order to}} modify the surface layer microstructure and to improve tribological properties or {{resistance to high temperature}} oxidation of the alloy. Various surface engineering techniques can be used to increase the surface hardness, e. g. deposition of the coatings composed of metallic carbides, nitrides or more recently DLC. The stiffness and strength properties of the coating and substrate materials differ significantly. Cracking of the usually <b>brittle</b> <b>coating</b> leads to stress concentration and localized plastic deformation of the substrate which can facilitate propagation of microcracks into the substrate. This can result in premature failure of the hard coated component. In the paper the crack penetrating hard coating was analysed and the influence of coating and substrate properties on crack driving force was numerically investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Two dimensional finite element analysis of the four point bending test of surface modified titanium alloy with the crack penetrating hardened layer was carried out. Findings: The effect of the coating thickness and stiffness, residual stresses in the coating, yield strength of substrate material and yield properties of diffusion hardened layer on crack driving force was determined. Research limitations/implications: Some extension of the numerical model should be introduced in order {{to take into account the}} interactions of the crack with microstructure of the material. Practical implications: The results could be used for selection of parameters of surface layer with complex structure in the process of the design of load bearing components against fracture. Originality/value: The fracture behaviour of hard coated materials was most frequently studied for indentation and friction conditions and considerably less concern was devoted to coated systems under tension or compression...|$|E
40|$|Concrete {{structures}} are often reinforced with steel. In {{order for the}} reinforcement to take over tensile forces, concrete has to crack. Through such cracks, water and compounds that are harmful to concrete can enter. This can cause durability issues like leakage, concrete degradation and reinforcement corrosion. In situ repair of cracks is often labour-intensive and inefficient. Preferentially, cracks are autonomously healed {{from the inside out}} in an early stage, preventing the ingress of water. This can be achieved by incorporating healing agent particles composed of nutrients and bacterial spores into the concrete matrix. The bacteria will germinate when water is available, plugging cracks with calcium carbonate. However, a coating is needed to protect the water-soluble healing agent from water during mixing. In order to allow the bacteria access to water for activation after the concrete has hardened, such a coating should break whenever a crack occurs in the concrete. Therefore, it should adhere well to the concrete matrix. It is possible to achieve this by protecting the particles with a <b>brittle</b> geopolymer <b>coating.</b> For this study, healing agent particles are coated with geopolymers following different mixture recipes. Metakaolin is used as an aluminosilicate source and sodium silicate as well as sodium aluminate are used as activator liquids. The particles are coated by granulation in a low-shear granulator. In order to improve the coating process, the operating window and the granulation mechanism are determined for all activator liquids used. Leaching and strength tests are performed and coated particles are incorporated in cement paste {{in order to determine the}} feasibility of application of the particles in concrete. Results show that the prepared particles are better protected from leaching than untreated particles. Using a high pressure single-fluid nozzle to improve nebulisation when coating produces more particles of the desired size than coating with a low pressure single-fluid nozzle with poor nebulisation. Furthermore, particles prepared with a high pressure nozzle sprayer perform better when incorporated into cement paste than particles prepared with a low pressure nozzle sprayer.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the barrier properties against water vapor and oxygen, inorganic-organic polymers can also function as protection layers against unwanted migration of chemical substances in two ways. First, hybrid polymers prevent components from migrating out of polymer substrates. This is of special interest for polymeric materials containing substances like plasticizing agents, unreacted monomers or catalysts. Thus the olfactory nuisance and the toxicological emission are decreased. The plastics are also prevented from becoming prematurely <b>brittle.</b> Second, the <b>coated</b> materials are also protected against the interaction of dyes or dirt staining the material. These functions {{can be achieved by}} thermally or UV curable coating materials, synthesized by the sol-gel technique. Since several polymer materials show only a low heat resistance (e. g. PVC, polyolefines), this publication is focussed on the development of new migration barriers based on photochemically curable sols. Another advantage of the UV process in comparison to thermal treatments are the short curing times and low power consumption which make this process even more attractive for industrial applications. The coatings were characterized by IR and solid state NMR spectroscopy. The migration barrier properties were tested according to industrial standards. Due to the choice of specific functional groups, these hybrid polymers can be further modified in order to combine the migration barrier function with additional properties: scratch and abrasion resistance, hydrophobicity, antistatic effects. Examples of feasible combinations of properties are also given...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} several {{engineering}} {{problems related to}} the fabrication and failure of microstructured optical fibers are addressed. The first of these problems is the flow of material during the drawing of these fibers. The fiber evolution is driven by either prescribing velocity or a force {{at the ends of}} the fiber, and the free surfaces evolve under the influence of surface tension, internal pressurization, inertia and gravity. We use the fact that ratio of the typical fiber radius to the typical fiber length is small to perform an asymptotic analysis of the full three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations similar to earlier work on non-axisymmetric (but simply connected) fibers. A numerical boundary integral solution to the multiply-connected steady state drawing problem is formulated based on the solution to the Sherman-Lauricella equation. The effects of different drawing and material parameters like surface tension, gravity, inertia and internal pressurization on the drawing is examined and extension of the method to non-isothermal evolution is presented. The second problem, is the heat transfer during the fabrication of the microstructured optical fibers. Although we do not solve the conjugate and coupled heat transfer problem, we present a Monte-Carlo ray tracing method to determine the overall absorption in the complex structure of the fiber and make suggestions on the use of a few different methodologies to solve the conjugate heat transfer problem. The last of these problems is associated with the failure of these fibers during usage. The last of these problems is related to the failure of these fiber during use. These fibers are commonly coated with hermetic coatings to protect them from harsh environments. It is well known that fibers <b>coated</b> with a <b>brittle</b> hermetic <b>coating</b> has a lower inert strength when compared to that of uncoated fibers. The nature of this strength degradation is examined and a new mechanism is proposed to explain this behavior. We proposed that the film cracks first and these cracks will propagate into the substrate under certain conditions and that these conditions dominate fiber failure. The determination of these conditions required {{the development of a new}} fracture mechanics based superposition scheme to determine the influence of external loads on thin film cracking. The existing solution for the case of a crack tip in the substrate is modified to provide a solution of greater accuracy. Crack arrest is examined and parameters for determining the possibility of crack arrest are presented. It was found that the mechanical properties of the thin films and the substrate affect the failure significantly. The mechanical properties of thin amorphous carbon films deposited on glass was measured using nano-indentation. Finally, experiments were performed to measure the strength of fibers with and without carbon coatings. The proposed failure model was checked with experimental data and this verified that the proposed model explains the failure of fibers with thin coatings. ...|$|R
