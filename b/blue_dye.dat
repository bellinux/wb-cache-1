5|$|Local traditions include Lantern Night, {{which was}} held on 16 September and {{involved}} children in the town with candle lanterns made from hollowed out root vegetables such as Mangelwurzel or swede. It was the last remaining reminder of the Watchet Fair (also known as St Decuman's Fair). Another tradition is Queen Caturn's Day on the last Saturday of November. Watchet was famous for its <b>blue</b> <b>dye</b> and Queen Caturn was so impressed she bestowed the town's folk with cider and cakes {{as a reward for}} this. The tradition is carried on with costumes and celebrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} named Bulgaria rufa in 1832 by Lewis David de Schweinitz, based on material collected from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. In 1913, Pier Andrea Saccardo transferred {{it to the}} genus Gloeocalyx as defined by George Edward Massee in 1901 (a genus now synonymous with Plectania) due to its hyaline (translucent) spores. Richard Korf made it the type species of his newly created Galiella in 1957, a genus that encompasses bulgarioid species (those with a morphology {{similar to those in}} Bulgaria) with spores that feature surface warts that are made of callose-pectic substances that stain with methyl <b>blue</b> <b>dye.</b>|$|E
40|$|In medicine, vital <b>blue</b> <b>dyes</b> {{are mainly}} {{used for the}} {{evaluation}} of sentinel lymph nodes in oncologic surgery. Perioperative anaphylaxis to <b>blue</b> <b>dyes</b> is a rare but significant complication. Allergic reactions to <b>blue</b> <b>dyes</b> are supposedly IgE-mediated and mainly caused by triarylmethanes (patent blue and isosulfane blue) and less frequently by methylene blue. These substances usually do not feature on the anesthesia record and should not be omitted from the list of suspects having caused the perioperative reaction, {{in the same manner as}} latex and chlorhexidine. The diagnosis of hypersensitivity to vital <b>blue</b> <b>dyes</b> can be established by skin test. We illustrate this topic with three clinical cases...|$|R

5|$|Under a light microscope, {{the spores}} {{are seen to}} be smooth, {{elliptical}} to oblong in shape, with dimensions of 3–5 by 2–3µm. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 4-spored, and have a narrow club-shape with dimension of 18–22 by 3.5–4.5µm. The gill cystidia are seen to stain blue when cotton <b>blue</b> <b>dye</b> and lactate are applied. The cap cuticle is made of an approximately 100µm thick layer of gelatinous hyphae that are about 2–4µm thick. The gelatinous hyphae are only present on the cap surface, not {{the surface of the}} stem; these local differences in cell structure explain the ease with which the scales are sloughed off the cap, but not the stems of the fruit bodies. The macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the mycelia of this species grown in culture have been described in detail.|$|E
25|$|The {{radioactive}} {{properties of}} 99mTc {{can be used}} to identify the predominant lymph nodes draining a cancer, such as breast cancer or malignant melanoma. This is usually performed at the time of biopsy or resection.99mTc-labelled isosulfan <b>blue</b> <b>dye</b> is injected intradermally around the intended biopsy site. The general location of the sentinel node is determined {{with the use of a}} handheld scanner with a gamma-sensor probe that detects the technetium-99m–labeled sulfur colloid that was previously injected around the biopsy site. An incision is then made over the area of highest radionuclide accumulation, and the sentinel node is identified within the incision by inspection; the isosulfan <b>blue</b> <b>dye</b> will usually stain any draining nodes blue.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 a new {{synthetic}} <b>blue</b> <b>dye,</b> called Indanthrone blue, was invented, {{which had}} even greater resistance to fading during washing {{or in the}} sun. This dye gradually replaced artificial indigo, whose production ceased in about 1970. Today almost all blue clothing is dyed with an indanthrone blue.|$|E

30|$|This study {{deals with}} the physico-chemical {{investigation}} of Prussian <b>blue</b> <b>dyed</b> textiles {{and the role of}} light, anoxiaa and type of textile on Prussian blue fading. For that purpose, we prepared modern Prussian <b>blue</b> <b>dyed</b> textiles on cotton, linen and silk. The samples underwent aging treatments that consisted in exposure to air, anoxia, air+light and anoxia+light. Fading of the samples was analyzed by spectrophotometry in addition to color difference Δ E * values, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Fe K-edge was performed to investigate structural changes of Prussian blue associated with the fading. The aging treatments were also performed on undyed textiles to analyze separately the contribution of textile aging on the final discoloration of the Prussian blue textile samples. Undyed and Prussian <b>blue</b> <b>dyed</b> textiles were again analyzed by spectrophotometry after 3 years storage in dark and air, to assess their ability to recover their initial color.|$|R
25|$|In the 1670s, English {{planters}} from Bermuda established themselves near {{what is now}} Charleston. Settlers built rice plantations in the South Carolina Lowcountry, east of the Atlantic Seaboard fall line. Settlers {{came from}} all over Europe.

25|$|In {{analytical}} methods, {{the protein}} migrate as bands based on size. Each band {{can be detected}} using stains such as Coomassie <b>blue</b> <b>dye</b> or silver stain. Preparative methods to purify large amounts of protein, require the extraction of the protein from the electrophoretic gel. This extraction may involve excision of the gel containing a band, or eluting the band directly off the gel as it runs {{off the end of}} the gel.|$|E
25|$|Faial's early {{economic}} growth was propelled by cultivation and processing of woad, a blue-coloured dye produced from a plant {{of the same}} name (in Latin, Isatis tinctoria). It was the only source for <b>blue</b> <b>dye</b> {{until the end of the}} 16th century when Portuguese trade routes started bringing indigo from the far east. Economic and population growth was also spearheaded by many legends of tin and silver, perpetuated by members of the Portuguese court.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the discovery of}} the enzyme system, Bernheim observed several unique properties of the tyramine oxidase system. She noted that the methylene <b>blue</b> <b>dye</b> used in the experiment was not reduced. This observation indicated that the tyramine oxidase system, unlike other enzyme systems, was not able to use the dye as a hydrogen acceptor. Additionally, the oxidative process within this enzyme system was seen to be resistant to the addition of cyanide. This observation showed that the tyramine oxidase system was an exception to Warburg's statement, which claimed that direct oxidation could not occur unless atmospheric oxygen was activated by iron. Instead, the system was seen to produce hydrogen peroxide, indicating that molecular oxygen acted as a hydrogen acceptor in the system. Bernheim also detected that the enzyme facilitated the occurrence of deamination in tyramine, along with the process of oxidation.|$|E
25|$|During the operation, {{the lymph}} nodes in the axilla are also {{considered}} for removal. In the past, large axillary operations took out 10 to 40 nodes to establish whether cancer had spread. This had the unfortunate side effect of frequently causing lymphedema of the arm on the same side, as the removal of this many lymph nodes affected lymphatic drainage. More recently, the technique of sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection has become popular, as it requires the removal of far fewer lymph nodes, resulting in fewer side effects while achieving the same 10-year survival as its predecessor. The sentinel lymph node is the first node that drains the tumor, and subsequent SLN mapping can save 65-70% of patients with breast cancer from having a complete lymph node dissection for what {{could turn out to}} be a negative nodal basin. Advances in Sentinel Lymph Node mapping over the past decade have increased the accuracy of detecting Sentinel Lymph Node from 80% using <b>blue</b> <b>dye</b> alone to between 92% and 98% using combined modalities. SLN biopsy is indicated for patients with T1 and T2 lesions (<5nbsp&cm) and carries a number of recommendations for use on patient subgroups. Recent trends continue to favor less radical axillar node resection even in the presence of some metastases in the sentinel node.|$|E
500|$|In Ancient Egypt, {{green was}} {{the symbol of}} {{regeneration}} and rebirth, and of the crops {{made possible by the}} annual flooding of the Nile. [...] For painting on the walls of tombs or on papyrus, Egyptian artists used finely ground malachite, mined in the west Sinai and the eastern desert; a paintbox with malachite pigment was found inside the tomb of King Tutankhamun. They also used less expensive green earth pigment, or mixed yellow ochre and blue azurite. To dye fabrics green, they first colored them yellow with dye made from saffron and then soaked them in <b>blue</b> <b>dye</b> from the roots of the woad plant.|$|E

25|$|Blue was a latecomer among colours used {{in art and}} decoration, as well as {{language}} and literature. Reds, blacks, browns, and ochres are found in cave paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period, but not blue. Blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red, ochre, pink and purple. This is {{probably due to the}} perennial difficulty of making good <b>blue</b> <b>dyes</b> and pigments. The earliest known <b>blue</b> <b>dyes</b> were made from plants – woad in Europe, indigo in Asia and Africa, while blue pigments were made from minerals, usually either lapis lazuli or azurite.|$|R

500|$|Notwithstanding the {{excellent}} {{state of the}} wooden panel prior to its 1998 restoration, the painting was unevenly covered with layers of dust and yellowed varnish. This was particularly pronounced {{in the area of}} the sky, obscuring many fine details and altering this area's colouring. Once these layers were removed, it was discovered that the original grey-blue sky had been repainted with broad strokes of a deep <b>blue</b> <b>dye</b> mixed with a fixing agent. An analysis of the blue pigments in the painting showed that the original blue colour, still discernible as a bright line above the horizon, was composed of azurite, while the blue pigment in more superficial layers was true ultramarine or lapis lazuli. The ultramarine layer has been identified as prussian blue, a pigment which was favoured from the early 18th century onwards. Additional alteration of the painting is well attested in parish accounts; the painting was [...] "varnished and somewhat restored" [...] by the painter Aline Bernard (1841–1910) in 1885, and a second time in 1907 by a Nils Janzon. The latter restoration was probably limited to the addition of a thick layer of varnish.|$|E
500|$|Historically, Chorioactis was {{considered}} to be in the family Sarcosomataceae. A 1983 monograph on the family included Chorioactis in the tribe Sarcosomateae (along with the genera Desmazierella, Sarcosoma, Korfiella, Plectania, and Urnula), a grouping of fungi characterized by having spores lacking small wartlike projections (verruculae) capable of absorbing <b>blue</b> <b>dye.</b> A 1994 study of the structural features of the asci and the ascospores concluded that Chorioactis was more closely aligned with the Sarcoscyphaceae, although it conceded that the layering of the cells comprising the walls of the ascus differed considerably from {{the other members of the}} family. It was not until 1999 that the results of phylogenetic analysis firmly challenged the traditional classification, showing C.geaster to be part of a distinct lineage, or clade, that includes species in the genera Desmazierella, Neournula, and Wolfina, taxa that were distributed among both families. This analysis was later corroborated when it was shown that the grouping of these four genera (by then called the [...] "Chorioactis clade") represented a sister clade to the Sarcosomataceae, and a new family, the Chorioactidaceae, was erected to contain them. Although C.geaster shares some characteristics with the other Chorioactidaceae genera, including dark-colored superficial [...] "hairs" [...] on the outer surface of the fruit bodies, it is distinguished from them by its tan to orange (rather than black) hymenia.|$|E
50|$|Anthraquinone type: Many {{acid dyes}} are {{synthesized}} from chemical intermediates that form anthraquinone-like structures as their final state. Many <b>blue</b> <b>dyes</b> have this structure as their basic shape. The structure predominates in the leveling class of acid dye.|$|R

2500|$|While blue was an {{expensive}} and prestigious colour in European painting, {{it became a}} common colour for clothing during the Renaissance. The rise of the colour blue in fashion in the 12th and 13th centuries led to a <b>blue</b> <b>dye</b> industry in several cities, notably Amiens, Toulouse, and Erfurt.
