2500|$|Another artist, Brian Welch, whose solo debut was {{released}} to Christian markets, found their album pulled from some Christian bookstores after the music video for [...] "Flush" [...] {{was released}}. The video is {{an interpretation of}} the authors personal experience with methamphetamine, before his religious conversion. At the time the album was pulled, Brian Welsh released a statement about the visual content of the video, relating its symbolism to his personal experiences of addiction and redemption. He also issued the following statement: [...] "The video for 'Flush' is about crystal meth addiction and the crazy things anyone addicted to meth will do while they're high or to get their fix. Everything the models were doing in the video is what I was wrapped up in while I was addicted to meth... I believe I would be dead right now if I continued using meth, <b>but</b> <b>instead,</b> <b>I</b> chose to surrender my life to Christ and die to myself so He could share His resurrection with me... There is a huge message of hope on my CD and I believe those retailers that are pulling the CD from their shelves are robbing someone spiritually by taking it off of the shelves." ...|$|E
2500|$|That night, Louis Martin and his daughters, Léonie, Céline and Thérèse, {{attended}} the midnight mass at the cathedral in Lisieux— [...] "but {{there was very}} little heart left in them. On 1 December, Léonie, covered in eczema and hiding her hair under a short mantilla, had returned to Les Buissonnets after just seven weeks of the Poor Clares regime in Alençon", and her sisters were helping her get over her sense of failure and humiliation. Back at Les Buissonnets as every year, Thérèse [...] "as was the custom for French children, had left her shoes on the hearth, empty in anticipation of gifts, not from Father Christmas but from the Child Jesus, who was imagined to travel through the air bearing toys and cakes." [...] While she and Celine were going up the stairs she heard her father, [...] "perhaps exhausted by the hour, or this reminder of the relentless emotional demands of his weepy youngest daughter", say with some irritation [...] "Therese is far too old for this now. Fortunately this will be the last year!" [...] Thérèse had begun to cry and Céline advised her not to go back downstairs immediately. Then, suddenly, Thérèse pulled herself together and wiped her tears. She ran down the stairs, knelt by the fireplace and unwrapped her surprises as jubilantly as ever. In her account, nine years later, of 1895 : [...] "In an instant Jesus, content with my good will, accomplished the work I {{had not been able to}} do in ten years." [...] After nine sad years she had [...] "recovered the strength of soul she had lost" [...] when her mother died and, she said, [...] "she was to retain it forever". She discovered the joy in self-forgetfulness and added, [...] "I felt, in a word, charity enter my heart, the need to forget myself to make others happy—Since this blessed night I was not defeated in any battle, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>I</b> went from victory to victory and began, so to speak, [...] "to run a giant's course" [...] (Psalms [...] ).|$|E

'Nurse {{would not let}} me speak to the cook, <b>but</b> said <b>instead</b> <b>I</b> might write to mamma; so I sent for my little table, but I found the drawer in such disorder, that I was setting it to rights.

6000|$|But {{upon this}} Sir Lamorack ran to Sir Tristram and catched {{him in his}} arms and kissed him upon the cheek. And he said: [...] "Tristram, thou art indeed a very noble soul.

Yes, I am poor, sir, and I need money. If I aid you----" [...] Hooker Montgomery paused suggestively.|$|E
60|$|One more frantic effort I {{made with}} my fast ebbing strength.

60|$|I {{might have}} said to Claude, So like a boy! <b>but</b> <b>I</b> didn't. <b>Instead,</b> <b>I</b> sympathized with him, and pointed out that it really didn't matter because I had spoiled it by jabbing my elbow through it.

6000|$|I {{was much}} {{surprised}} by this explanation, {{and a good deal}} relieved to find that the vessel, after all, was not a pirate; <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> of replying, <b>I</b> said, [...] "If it be as you state, then why did you take me from my island, and why do you not now take me back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|To be {{an entirely}} {{orthodox}} father I should raise merry hell [...] about your debts and utter inutility, {{at the same}} time [...] disinheriting you, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>I</b> am going to urge you to [...] come home and run in debt here where the cost of living is [...] not so high as in the East--meanwhile praying that your [...] awakening may come while I am on earth to rejoice.|$|E

60|$|Shea {{had just}} beaten me at chess, as usual, and, also as usual, I had gleaned what {{questionable}} satisfaction I might by twitting him with this indication of failing mentality by calling {{his attention to}} the nth time to that theory, propounded by certain scientists, which is based upon the assertion that phenomenal chess players are always found to be from the ranks of children under twelve, adults over seventy-two or the mentally defective--a theory that is lightly ignored upon those rare occasions that I win. Shea had gone to bed and I should have followed suit, for we are always in the saddle here before sunrise; <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>I</b> sat there before the chess table in the library, idly blowing smoke at the dishonored head of my defeated king.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked in}} a May 2015 {{interview}} if celibacy is a disincentive for young men considering the priesthood, Heße responded:It is so, that many young people object it. For me, celibacy {{is more of a}} liberation and an expression that I put everything on this one card, namely God."When asked if celibacy was a relief for him, he said:Yes, because I believe freedom does not consist of me leaving everything open and free and undetermined, <b>but</b> <b>instead,</b> that <b>I</b> choose and commit myself.

6000|$|... "There is {{not much}} more to tell, when I say that I met with Abel Hunt. We came {{together}} nearabout the quarters of the Rangers, where I stood {{hoping to get a}} glimpse of the mare, and, daring to take me by the arm as if he were my equal, he demanded to know what I did there in the British camp. Then it was I forgot myself, allowing my temper to get the best of me, and instead of speaking him fairly because of the circumstances, I threatened he should be flogged by one of my uncle's negroes in the slave quarters, for daring to thus accost me. It stands to reason that I realize now how foolish was this course, for I might have put him off, or answered his question after my own fashion, and later, when there were not so many king's lovers around, I could have had him punished. <b>But,</b> <b>instead,</b> <b>I</b> lost control of myself, as I have said, and I believe my actions pleased the scoundrel. He taunted me with being a rebel, and otherwise strove to set yet further flame to my anger, until forgetting all else, having lost to mind the danger in which you lads would be placed, I struck at the fellow, knocking him down, much to my satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|Hobhouse {{and your}} humble are still here. Hobhouse hunts, etc., and I [...] do nothing; we dined {{the other day}} with a {{neighbouring}} Esquire (not [...] Collet of Staines), and regretted your absence, as the Bouquet of [...] Staines was scarcely to be compared to our last [...] "feast of reason." [...] You [...] know, laughing is {{the sign of a}} rational animal; so says Dr. Smollett. [...] I think so, too, but unluckily my spirits don't always keep pace with [...] my opinions.

60|$|Suddenly {{my blood}} seemed to freeze in my veins, {{and my heart}} to stand still. Was it fancy, or were we moving? I turned my eyes {{to look for the}} other canoe which should be {{alongside}} of us. I could not see it, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>I</b> saw a lean and clutching black hand lifting itself above the gunwale of the little boat. Surely it was a nightmare! At the same instant a dim but devilish-looking face appeared to rise out of the water, and then came a lurch of the canoe, the quick flash of a knife, and an awful yell from the Wakwafi who was sleeping by my side (the same poor fellow whose odour had been annoying me), and something warm spurted into my face. In an instant the spell was broken; I knew that it was no nightmare, but that we were attacked by swimming Masai. Snatching at the first weapon that came to hand, which happened to be Umslopogaas' battleaxe, I struck with all my force in the direction in which I had seen the flash of the knife. The blow fell upon a man's arm, and, catching it against the thick wooden gunwale of the canoe, completely severed it from the body just above the wrist. As for its owner, he uttered no sound or cry. Like a ghost he came, and like a ghost he went, leaving behind him a bloody hand still gripping a great knife, or rather a short sword, that was buried in the heart of our poor servant.|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} {{argued that it}} does not matter morally whether {{biomedical}} interventions treat or prevent diseases or enhance nondisease traits; what matters is whether and how much they promote well-being. Therapy and enhancement both promote well-being, the argument goes, so they are not morally distinct <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> continuous. <b>I</b> provide three reasons why this argument should be rejected when it is applied to choices concerning the genetic makeup of future people. First, it rests on too simple a conception of the badness of disease. Second, it wrongly assumes that disease avoidance and enhancement can proceed with similar accuracy. Third, it overlooks that disease avoidance tends to be more urgent than enhancement {{from the point of view}} of distributive justice. Although none of these reasons establishes a firm therapy-enhancement distinction, they show that a continuum model is not an attractive alternative...|$|R
