40|$|Rustenburg Platinum Mines, Union Section, {{is located}} in the mafic phase of the {{north-western}} sector of the Bushveld Complex. This part of the Complex is characterised by transgressions of Upper zone ferrogabbros across the lower sequence of mafic rocks. These transgressions have effectively isolated a roughly triangular segment of Lower, Critical and Main zone rocks. It is in {{the upper part of the}} Critical zone that the Merensky Reef, with a strike length of 9, 5 km, is found to suboutcrop below a 2 - 3 m <b>black</b> <b>turf</b> <b>soil</b> cover and it constitutes the orebody being mined at Union Section. Underground mining and development have exposed a stratigraphic succession from the Middle Group chromitites to within the lower part of the Main zone gabbros. A detailed investigation of a 100 m stratigraphic succession was undertaken in the upper part of the Critical zone, which includes the Bastard Reef, Merensky Reef, Pseudo Reef, UG 2 and UG 1 layers. Stratigraphic descriptions are presented for both a normal and potholed succession, as well as a description of pothole characteristics. The variations of Merensky Reef thickness, pothole distribution and structure of the are body are also discussed. Forty seven whole-rock major- and trace-element analyses were carried out on selected samples from both normal and potholed successions, although more emphasis was placed on the former. These samples were taken from just below the UG 1 to above the Bastard Reef. Trace elements determined included Sr, Rb, Y, Nb, Zr, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu and V. The cyclical nature of the layering is clearly defined by breaks in the trends of both the major- and trace element analyses, although some elements are strongly influenced by the modal proportions of the mai n mineral phases. Although major breaks are observed for individual elements, insignificant variation of the Mg/Mg+Fe 2 + ratio is observed throughout. New electron microprobe data are presented for the main silicate phases olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and plagioclase, while only a limi ted number of analyses were carried out on the spine l phase. There would appear to be a reversal of the expected fractionation trend from the hanging wal l of the UG 2 to the Pseudo Marker layer. There is an upward increase of the Fo content of the olivine from F 0 ₇₆, ₇₋₈₁,₆. A similar trend is observed for the orthopyroxene analyses. The Merensky unit, as a whole, exhibits a gradual decrease in the Mg end member of the Ca-poor pyroxenes from En ₇₈,₅₋₇₄. was found to be markedly more calcic Cumulus plagioclase (An ₇₂, ₈-₈₁, ₇) than the intercumulus phase (An₅₆,₃₋₇₁, ₉) ' A further feature of the cumulus plagioclase is that strong zonation was observed with the cores of individual crystals being consistently lower in Ca relative to their margins.

40|$|Signal {{degradation}} impacts all communications. Although acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL) quorum sensing {{signals are}} known to be degraded by defined laboratory cultures, little is known about their stability in nature. Here, we show {{for the first time that}} acyl-HSLs are biodegraded in soils sampled from diverse US sites. When amended to soil samples at physiologically relevant concentrations, 14 C-labeled acyl-HSLs were mineralized to 14 CO 2 rapidly and, at most sites examined, without lag. A lag-free <b>turf</b> <b>soil</b> activity was characterized in further detail. Heating or irradiation of the soil prior to the addition of radiolabel abolished mineralization, whereas protein synthesis inhibitors did not. Mineralization exhibited an apparent Km of 1. 5 µM acyl-HSL, ca. 1000 -fold lower than that reported for a purified acyl-HSL lactonase. Under optimal conditions, acyl-HSL degradation proceeded at a rate of 13. 4 nmol. h- 1. g of fresh weight soil- 1. An MPN of 4. 6 × 105 cells. g of turf soil- 1 degraded physiologically relevant amounts of hexanoyl-[1 - 14 C]HSL to 14 CO 2. The results implicate a real-world challenge for acyl-HSL-producing bacteria to outpace biological acyl-HSL degradation and thus to successfully engage in cell-cell communications in soils and other environments. Furthermore, high-affinity acyl-HSL degraders were enriched in oligotrophic biofilm reactors that were inoculated with the <b>turf</b> <b>soil.</b> When supplied at physiological concentration, acyl-HSL was observed to be > 95 % consumed through the reactors. Six bacterial strains were isolated belonging to Variovorax, Mesorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium and Labrys genera. Unambiguous growth of the six isolates on physiological amount of acyl-HSLs under oligotrophic condition was demonstrated. A Variovorax strain SOD 31 exhibited acyl-HSL-limiting growth kinetics with a half-saturation constant of 1. 7 µM, which is in high agreement with what we observed from the <b>turf</b> <b>soil.</b> The results suggest that strain SOD 31 may be an active contributor to the soil’s activity of degrading acyl-HSLs. This research reinforces the importance of signal decay as intrinsic to bacterial cell-cell communication, as well as providing bases for further studies towards how signal decay may influence community function and structure in naturally occurring microbial communities...|$|R

Texas, the state with the largest feral hog population, reports the annual damage to agriculture at $ 51. 8 million (Adams et al. 2005). The total damage caused by feral swine in the United States is estimated to be approximately $ 800 million annually (Pimentel et al. 2000).

40|$|Effects of {{long-term}} turfgrass management on soil nematode community and nutrient pools Lawns provide many {{benefits to the}} environment and society, such as minimizing soil erosion, contributing to carbon sequestration, reducing run-off and leaching, and providing spaces for recreation. Conventional lawn management relies heavily on fertilizers and pesticides, which may impair natural ecological processes in the lawn ecosystem and are also perceived to be sources of environmental pollution. However, due to extensive root growth and the continuous addition of clippings and nutrient inputs, lawn ecosystems are rich in organic matter and thus have high microbial biomass and activity, which can rapidly degrade chemical pesticides. Thus, we hypothesized that the application of herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides to turfgrass will not significantly affect soil microbial biomass or food web status. Nematodes are now widely used as bio-indicators for soil ecosystems as they function at almost every trophic level and react rapidly to contaminants and disturbances. A new model integrating nematode feeding groups and the colonizer-persister scale into a matrix classification of functional guilds can be used to assess soil food web structure and health. Enrichment Index (EI) and Structure Index (SI) are the two key components of this model. Based on this model, we hypothesized that the amount of nitrogen fertilizer input will affect soil nematode community and food web health. Due to the fact that organic management practices are becoming attractive, we also tested whether organic input management improves <b>turf</b> <b>soil</b> ecosystem conditions over inorganic input management...|$|R
40|$|Stones, and {{especially}} the arrangement of large stones in relation to one another, have long {{been the focus of}} attention in megalith studies, a concern reflected in the name itself. It is, however, a blinkered view. Many so-called megalithic monuments embody other carefully selected materials in their construction, including <b>turf,</b> <b>soil,</b> rubble, and timber. In considering long barrows, Paul Ashbee noted that it was a false distinction to separate earthen long barrows from stone-chambered long barrows as the builders of long barrows inevitably used materials available within their local environments. Alternatively, writing mainly about the Irish material, Arthur ApSimon suggested a development from timber to stone implying an onological progression in the preferred use of materials. Whether environmental or evolutionary, it is certain that many monuments interchangeably combine stone and wood in their construction in a way that forces us to consider what these and other materials meant to the megalith builders. Was it simply about what was available? Or what was fashionable? Or were there deeper sets of meanings relating to how different materials were perceived and understood within the cosmological systems that lie behind the design, construction,and use of long barrows, passage graves, dolmens and other related monuments? Focusing upon wood and stone, it is argued here that both were components of a cyclical world view of life and death that was embedded in the fabric and structure of monuments...|$|R

An innovative collaboration between local council, property developer and University attempted to take a comprehensive and scientific approach to minimise the loss and ensure the best compensatory habitat created. The development site contained heath and wetland habitat for several rare animals and populations of five EVR plant species. Thus species assemblages present on the site that were known to provide habitat for the rare animals were required to be compensated for {{as well as the}} habitat and populations of the EVR plant species.

Under optimal conditions, acyl-HSL degradation proceeded at a rate of 13. 4 nmol · h– 1 · g of fresh weight soil– 1. Bioassays established that the final extent of signal inactivation was greater than for its full conversion to CO 2 but that the two processes were well coupled kinetically.

It would take chemical lactonolysis months to match the level of signal decay achieved in days by the observed biological activity. Rapid decay might serve either to quiet signal cross talk that might otherwise occur between spatially separated microbial aggregates or as a full system reset.

Application of gypsum (CaSO₄ 2 H₂O) at 2 240 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ is often recommended to control the Na. Research to determine if this rate is effective on effluent -irrigated turfgrass sites is lacking. A 2 -yr study was carried out {{on a golf course}} fairway (typic tomf 7 uvent soil) with a 10 yr history of effluent irrigation and elevated Na levels (800 mg kg⁻¹). Four rates of gypsum (0, 2 240, 4 480, and 8 960 kg ha⁻¹) were surface applied in November 1986 and 1987. Soil samples were collected every 3 months after treatment (MAT) and analyzed for Ca (total and water - soluble (WSCa)), Mg, K, Na, SO₄⁻²-S (S), pH, and electrical conductivity (EC). Results showed elevated WSCa and S levels 3 and 6 MAT in both years. The two highest rates resulted in elevated S levels 12 MAT. During both years, gypsum at the two higher rates decreased Na levels within 3 MAT. The lowest application rate did not reduce Na levels until 12 MAT in 1987 and its effects were not as great. Following the second annual application, the 2 240 kg ha⁻¹ rate was as effective as the higher rates in reducing Na levels 6 and 12 MAT. Total Ca levels were not affected by gypsum but Mg and K levels did decrease. In both years, a temporary increase in EC and decrease in pH occurred after gypsum treatment.
