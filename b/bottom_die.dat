50|$|In coining, the top tool {{forces the}} {{material}} into the <b>bottom</b> <b>die</b> with 5 to 30 times {{the force of}} air bending, causing permanent deformation through the sheet.

50|$|A {{single-acting}} {{steam hammer}} is {{raised by the}} pressure of steam injected into {{the lower part of}} a cylinder and drops under gravity when the pressure is released. With the more common double-acting steam hammer, steam is also used to push the ram down, giving a more powerful blow at the die.The weight of the ram may range from 225 to 22500 kg.The piece being worked is placed between a <b>bottom</b> <b>die</b> resting on an anvil block and a top die attached to the ram (hammer).|$|E
5000|$|Rotary bending {{is similar}} to wiping but the top die is made of a freely {{rotating}} cylinder with the final formed shape cut into it and a matching <b>bottom</b> <b>die.</b> On contact with the sheet, the roll contacts on two points and it rotates as the forming process bends the sheet. This bending method is typically considered a [...] "non-marking" [...] forming process suitable to pre-painted or easily marred surfaces. This bending process can produce angles greater than 90° in a single hit on standard press brakes process.|$|E
50|$|Hammered coins were {{produced}} {{by placing a}} blank piece of metal (a planchet or flan) of the correct weight between two dies, and then striking the upper die with a hammer to produce the required image on both sides. The planchet was usually cast from a mold. The <b>bottom</b> <b>die</b> (sometimes called the anvil die) was usually counter sunk in a log or other sturdy surface and was called a pile.

50|$|A {{circular}} sheet (blank) of 118 mm diameter was {{cut from}} the alloy sheet and the cut surfaces polished to remove burrs. The blank {{was placed on the}} die and the top chamber brought in contact. The furnace was switched on to the set temperature. Once the set temperature was reached the top chamber was brought down further to effect the required blank holder pressure. About 10 minutes were allowed for thermal equilibration. The argon gas cylinder was opened to the set pressure gradually. Simultaneously, the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT), fitted {{at the bottom of the}} die, was set for recording the sheet bulge. Once the LVDT reached 45 mm (radius of <b>bottom</b> <b>die),</b> gas pressure was stopped and the furnace switched off. The formed components were taken out when the temperature of the die set had dropped to 600 °C. Easy removal of the component was possible at this stage. Superplastic bulge forming of hemispheres were carried out at temperatures of 1098, 1123, 1148, 1173, 1198 and 1223 K (825, 850, 875, 900, 925 and 950 °C) at forming pressures of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.87 MPa. As the bulge forming process progresses, significant thinning in the sheet material becomes obvious. An ultrasonic technique was used to measure the thickness distribution on the profile of the formed component. The components were analyzed in terms of the thickness distribution, thickness strain and thinning factor. Post deformation micro-structural studies were conducted on the formed components in order to analyze the microstructure in terms of grain growth, grain elongation, cavitations, etc.|$|E

50|$|A {{steam hammer}} may {{have one or}} two {{supporting}} frames. The single frame design lets the operator move around the dies more easily, while the double frame can support a more powerful hammer. The frame(s) and the anvil block are mounted on wooden beams that protect the concrete foundations by absorbing the shock.Deep foundations are needed, but a large steam drop hammer will still shake the building that holds it. This may be solved with a counterblow steam hammer, in which two converging rams drive the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>dies</b> together. The upper ram is driven down and the lower ram is pulled or driven up. These hammers produce a large impact and can make large forgings.They can be installed with smaller foundations than anvil hammers of similar force.Counterblow hammers are not often used in the United States, but are common in Europe.|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a deep drawing die (1) with a top die and a <b>bottom</b> <b>die</b> (2, 3), wherein the top die (2) has a holding down clamp (2 a) and the <b>bottom</b> <b>die</b> (3) has a die plate (3 a), and wherein at least one device (6), with which {{the distance between the}} holding down clamp (2 a) and the die plate (3 a) can be modified in portions or partially, is arranged in a flange region. The invention further relates to a method for deep drawing a workpiece (4) with a deep drawing die (1), wherein a workpiece (4) is inserted between a top die and a <b>bottom</b> <b>die</b> (2, 3) and deep drawn by closing the top and bottom dies (2, 3), and wherein at least one actuator (8) is controlled to generate a holding force during deep drawing. Essentially, the invention presented controls the flange feed of a workpiece (4) in the tool (1) by pressure distributions which are adjustable in the forming process. By selectively increasing forces in the flange feed at selected locations between holding down clamp (2 a) and die plate (3 a) it is possible to control the flow of material into the die plate (3 a) during deep drawing. Using this control, it is possible to relieve the load on regions with high deforming work, so that tears or cracks at these points in the finished component can be prevented. This involves increasing the friction between die plate (3 a) and plate (4) or between plate (4) and holding down clamp (2 a) by generating holding forces, as a result of which the material is held fast and prevented from flowing at this location...|$|E

25|$|Oxygen is {{required}} by all aerobically respiring plants and animals and it is replenished in daylight by photosynthesizing plants and algae. Under eutrophic conditions, dissolved oxygen greatly increases during the day, but is greatly reduced after dark by the respiring algae and by microorganisms that feed on the increasing mass of dead algae. When dissolved oxygen levels decline to hypoxic levels, fish and other marine animals suffocate. As a result, creatures such as fish, shrimp, and especially immobile <b>bottom</b> dwellers <b>die</b> off. In extreme cases, anaerobic conditions ensue, promoting growth of bacteria such as Clostridium botulinum that produces toxins deadly to birds and mammals.

40|$|The {{wedge shape}} {{is a fairly}} common {{cross-section}} found in many non-axisymmetric components used in machines, aircraft, ships and automobiles. If such components are forged between two mutually inclined dies the metal displaced by the dies flows into the converging as well as into the diverging channels created by the inclined dies. The extent of each type of flow (convergent/divergent) depends on the die—material interface friction and the included die angle. Given the initial cross-section, the length {{as well as the}} exact geometry of the forged cross-section are therefore uniquely determined by these parameters. In this paper a simple stress analysis is used to predict changes in the geometry of a wedge undergoing compression between inclined platens. The flow in directions normal to the cross-section is assumed to be negligible. Experiments carried out using wedge-shaped lead billets show that, knowing the interface friction {{and as long as the}} deformation is not too large, the dimensional changes in the wedge can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. The predicted flow behaviour of metal for a wide range of die angles and interface friction is presented: these characteristics can be used by the die designer to choose the die lubricant (only) if the die angle is specified and to choose both of these parameters if there is no restriction on the exact die angle. The present work shows that the length of a wedge undergoing compression is highly sensitive to die—material interface friction. Thus in a situation where the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>dies</b> are inclined to each other, a wedge made of the material to be forged could be put between the dies and then compressed, whereupon the length of the compressed wedge — given the degree of compression — affords an estimate of the die—material interface friction...|$|R
