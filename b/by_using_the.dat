5|$|The {{player is}} free to join {{any one of the}} servile groups and share common goals, or remain unaligned. Geneforge can be {{completed}} without joining any group.

He can also be aided in activating the device, if the player steals the shaper gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player fake shaper gauntlets, which do not protect Trajkov from the Geneforge's energy should he be convinced they are genuine shaping gloves. The player can complete the game <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> last boat on Sucia Island. The small vessel is moored in a guarded dock {{on the far side of}} the island.

40|$|The {{transformation}} of indirect belirubin to direct was observed {{on the action}} of various organ's tissues to the serum solution of the indirect bilirubin prepared from the jaundiced urine. The results are as follows. 1. The indirect bilirubin prepared from the jaundiced urine is partly transformed to direct bilirubin on the preparation of its serum solution. 2. The action transforming indirect bilirubin to direct bilirubin is observed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> liver and lung tissues of healthy rabbit. The possibility of the above action is also expected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> cerebllum and skin, but the action can not be obtained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> heart, kidney, adrenal gland, medulla oblongata, cerebllum and peritoneum. 3. The function of the reticuloendothelial system seems {{not to participate in}} the {{transformation of}} indirect bilirubin to direct, since the results observed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> organ's tissues in the rabbit with thrombosis of the reticuloendothelial system are as same as the results observed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> as healthy rabbit. 4. The action transforming indirect bilirubin to direct bilirubin is obstructed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> liver tissue in the rabbit with administration of carbon tetrachloride, but not <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of their lung tissues. Carbon tetrachloride, therefore, seems not to influence on the lung. 6.
