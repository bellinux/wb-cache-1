5|$|As a {{literary}} theorist, Chivers <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> divine inspiration.

Such beliefs and practices were later developed and individualized by the many Slavic tribes.|$|E

5|$|Ahimsa {{is one of}} the {{cardinal}} virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Most popularly, Mahatma Gandhi strongly <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the principle of ahimsa.|$|E

5|$|Arguably {{the first}} {{exposition}} of empirical materialism {{in the history}} of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the four elements), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.|$|E
