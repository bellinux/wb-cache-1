40|$|Some urban streams {{experience}} {{rapid depletion}} of dissolved oxygen (DO) associated with major stormwater runoff events. In some situations, the <b>DO</b> <b>depletion</b> can {{be sufficient to}} rapidly cause low DO {{that can lead to}} fish kills. This issue of the Newsletter is Part I of a two-part Newsletter that examines the role of aquatic sediments in causing the rapid <b>depletion</b> of <b>DO</b> in some urban and rural streams associated with stormwater runoff events that suspend sediments into the watercolumn where they exert oxygen demand. Also, focus is given to the potential for similar, rapid <b>DO</b> <b>depletion</b> in US navigable waterways (river and harbor systems) associated with the exertion of sediment oxygen demand when sediments become suspended into the watercolumn during storms and open water disposal of dredged sediments. While sediment oxygen demand is typically said to be associated with relatively slow biotic reactions (decomposition of organics), there are situations in which abiotic (inorganic) reactions {{play a major role in}} <b>DO</b> <b>depletion</b> in a waterbody watercolumn. Examples of these situations are discussed herein...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{dissolved}} oxygen (<b>DO)</b> <b>depletion,</b> caused by inorganic {{chemical oxygen demand}} (COD) of re-suspended sediment compounds, has been documented in few studies, yet fish kills occur often from the process. Pescadero Lagoon, California, USA, a bar-built lagoon that suffers annual fish kills caused by rapid mixing-induced hypoxia upon sandbar breach, was studied to investigate the potential for COD of re-suspended sediment to deplete oxygen. In-situ chamber mixing trials demonstrated that re-suspended sediment can exert powerful oxygen demand on receiving waters. Surface <b>DO</b> <b>depletion</b> upon bar breach was too severe to be explained solely by mixing of the anoxic hypolimnion into the water column, and the depletion was too rapid to be attributed to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), making COD of re-suspended sediment the likely direct cause. Sedimentous iron and sulfur compounds that exert COD are reduced under anoxic conditions created by water column stratification and BOD of heterotrophic bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Tidal streams are ecologically {{important}} {{components of}} lotic network, and we identify dissolved oxygen (<b>DO)</b> <b>depletion</b> as a potentially important stressor in freshwater tidal streams of northern New Zealand. Other {{studies have examined}} temporal DO variability within rivers and we build on this by examining variability between streams {{as a basis for}} regional-scale predictors of risk for DO stress. Diel DO variability in these streams was driven by: (1) photosynthesis by aquatic plants and community respiration which produced DO maxima in the afternoon and minima early morning (range, 0. 6 – 4. 7 g/m³) as a product of the solar cycle and (2) tidal variability as a product of the lunar cycle, including saline intrusions with variable DO concentrations plus a small residual effect on freshwater DO for low-velocity streams. The lowest DO concentrations were observed during March (early autumn) when water temperatures and macrophyte biomass were high. Spatial comparisons indicated that lowgradient tidal streams were at greater risk of <b>DO</b> <b>depletions</b> harmful to aquatic life. Tidal influence was stronger in low-gradient streams, which typically drain more developed catchments, have lower reaeration potential and offer conditions more suitable for aquatic plant proliferation. Combined, these characteristics supported a simple method based on the extent of low-gradient channel for identifying coastal streams at risk of <b>DO</b> <b>depletion.</b> High-risk streams can then be targeted for riparian planting, nutrient limits and water allocation controls to reduce potential ecological stress...|$|R

40|$|Although {{much work}} has been done to predict the effects of hypoxia (dissolved oxygen 3 ̆c 2 mg l− 1) at {{regional}} scales, individual estuaries consist of a patchwork of micro-environments that can have different responses. We followed the effects of extended dissolved oxygen (<b>DO)</b> <b>depletion</b> on benthic fluxes of CO 2, O 2, NO 3 −, NH 4 +, N 2, PO 43 − and Fe from estuarine sediments from 3 shallow sites with different macrofauna communities and levels of organic enrichment. <b>DO</b> <b>depletion</b> was achieved by a prolonged (40 d) dark incubation of sealed sediment cores. There were no discernible differences in NO 3 − and N 2 fluxes between sites, but the effects of hypoxia on sediment metabolism, and on bioavailable nutrient release, NH 4 + and PO 43 −, were modified by the initial macrofauna communities. The DO in cores containing sediments from a site dominated by small epifauna declined significantly faster than in cores containing a greater portion of burrowing infauna; burrows may provide an oxic reservoir within the sediments. Macrofauna mortality led to a more rapid efflux of mineralization products (CO 2, NH 4 + and PO 43 −) in the epifauna-dominated sites, as the small surface-dwelling animals decomposed more quickly. However, the cores were sealed, preventing migration of mobile epifauna away from the hypoxic conditions. The site with the lowest abundance of macrofauna also contained a large amount of refractory organic matter. Decomposition of this material was slow, with little release of nutrients. The study highlights the fact that environmental patchiness can modify the effects of hypoxia and stresses the importance of deeper burrowing fauna as a buffer against declining DO conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} reservoir {{model was}} applied to simulate the vertical-longitudinal hy-drodynamics and water quality in Lake Erie during 1994. Central basin hypolimnetic anoxia was modelled to occur where the metalimnion intersected the sloping lake-bed, thus inhibiting diapycnal diffusion of dissolved oxygen (DO) through the water-column directly overlying the sediments. Using a sediment oxygen demand SOD = 0. 55 gm 2 d− 1, a threshold near bed buoyancy frequency criterion N 2 bed> 10 − 3 s− 2 was required for sig-nificant hypolimnetic <b>DO</b> <b>depletion</b> (<b>DO</b> < 5 mgL− 1). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the pattern of near-bed depletion could be modelled to within ∼ 2 mgL− 1 by con-sidering only surface and sediment DO fluxes; where nutrient loads and the remaining biogeochemistry were neglected within the model framework. Generalization to the SOD versus N 2 bed domain, suggests that for 1994 conditions SOD < 0. 2 gm 2 d− 1 would ensure a near bed DO concentration greater than 5 mgL− 1; sufficient to support fish life. 1...|$|R
40|$|Polyamines are organic polycations {{essential}} {{for a wide}} variety of cellular functions, including nuclear integrity and chromosome condensation. Here we present genetic evidence that depletion of cellular polyamines partially alleviates the defects in HO and SUC 2 expression caused by inactivation of the GCN 5 histone acetyltransferase. In addition, the combination of polyamine depletion and a sin(-) allele of the histone H 4 gene leads to almost complete bypass of the transcriptional requirement for GCN 5. In contrast, polyamine <b>depletion</b> <b>does</b> not alter the transcriptional requirements for the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex nor <b>does</b> <b>depletion</b> lead to global defects in transcriptional regulation. In addition to these genetic studies, we show that polyamines facilitate oligomerization of nucleosomal arrays in vitro, and that polyamine-mediated condensation requires intact core histone N-terminal domains and is inhibited by histone hyperacetylation. Our studies suggest that polyamines are repressors of transcription in vivo, and that one role of histone hyperacetylation is to antagonize the ability of polyamines to stabilize highly condensed states of chromosomal fibers...|$|R
