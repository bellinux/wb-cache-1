30|$|The {{first stage}} was an {{in-depth}} examination of all 17 (8 [*]+[*] 9) individual cases studied independently (Appendix 1 and 2) {{to find a}} social business format based on the conceptual framework checklist. Firstly, nine social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> were studied carefully and key variables were identified (Appendix 2), and then the variables were set into the social business format checklist from social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> (Table  2). This checklist provides a general social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> format. Secondly, eight social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> from only the water sectors were studied carefully and key variables were identified (Appendix 1); then the variables were set into the social business format checklist from social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> for the water sector (Table  3). This checklist provides a general social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> format for the water sectors.

30|$|In this phase, zakah {{institution}} {{will assist}} in establishing small <b>business</b> <b>enterprise</b> to those poor whose skill is at satisfactory level. Since {{a lot of}} activities are required {{to set up a}} <b>business</b> <b>enterprise,</b> it can be very difficult for the poor to set up <b>business</b> <b>enterprises.</b> On the contrary, zakah institution (authority/individual/team) should take initiatives to establish as well as run the <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> (where the poor will be the real owner) on behalf of those whose skill is not at satisfactory level. In fact, for being the real owners of enterprises, the poor will enjoy profit or bear loss. But, since the management of the enterprise would be in the hand of an expert body, the management will receive salary/allowance for their valuable time and expertise from the income of <b>business</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Because, it is the experiences of many countries (such as Bangladesh) that only due to poor managerial skills, the poor cannot run their <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> successfully, consequently poor remain poor even after receiving zakah in a good form like an organized <b>business</b> <b>enterprise.</b> But, the poor (owners) {{will be able to do}} job in the <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> as per their skill.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} whether Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and {{the responsibilities}} of <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> for human rights have been legally defined in international, European law and national law. This analysis, in turn, generates novel insights and impetus for reconsidering the international legal personality of <b>business</b> <b>enterprises.</b> If CSR has emerged in the law as a new category of legal obligations at the international level, which this thesis finds is not the case, {{this may be the}} breakthrough that renders <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> subjects of international law. Yet, CSR regulatory initiatives are trends in global governance that increasingly question the relevance of the (arguably still dominant) positivist perspective and, hence, conventional doctrines on international legal personality. This thesis confronts and tests the validity of, existing doctrinal approaches to the legal personality of <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> with the evolving realities of the emerging business and human rights regime. In doing so, insights are drawn from theoretical approaches to global governance to determine the impact of CSR, and {{the responsibilities of}} <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> for human rights, in the thorny topic of ‘subjects of (international) law’ and what, if anything, makes <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> ‘legal persons’ in a global governance context. nrpages: 497 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Small <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> are the {{backbone}} of economic growth and innovation. The existence of the Internet provides opportunities for these enterprises to gain the benefits of Information and Communication Technologies in their business operations. However, small <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> often face a variety of challenges such as limited financial resources, a shortage of skilled workers, and inadequate infrastructure (such as communication connectivity or electricity supply particularly in rural areas) in adopting new technology in their business operations. Many small <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> are not engaged with appropriate business strategies which lead to informal and mixed marketing approaches in their businesses. This paper proposes an Internet marketing adoption framework for small <b>business</b> <b>enterprises.</b> The proposed framework of Internet marketing would be incorporated {{as part of the}} business strategies for small <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> in order to assist owners and managers (who are often poor planners).
