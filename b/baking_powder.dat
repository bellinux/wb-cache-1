5|$|Primary {{ingredients}} in an old-fashioned doughnut include flour, sugar, eggs, sour cream or buttermilk, and leavening agents such as <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> or baking soda. Additional ingredients may include milk, butter, vanilla extract and salt. The use of buttermilk or sour cream may impart a rich flavor to the doughnut. It is typically deep-fried, {{and may be}} deep fried at a lower temperature compared to other doughnut styles, having a crunchier texture compared to other cake doughnut styles. Frying at a lower temperature contributes to its rough, cracked texture. Being turned several times while cooking in the oil also contributes to its texture.|$|E
5|$|Gibanica {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{recognizable}} pastry dishes from the Balkans, whether served on festive occasions, or as a comforting family snack. In Serbia, the dish is often consumed at traditional events such as Christmas, Easter and Slava. According to the Serbian media, the largest Gibanica ever made was in the town of Mionica in 2007. It weighed over 1,000 kg, and was applied for inclusion in the Guinness Book of Records. 330kg of phyllo dough, 330kg of cheese, 3,300 eggs, 30 l. of oil, 110 l. of mineral water, 50kg of lard and 500 packets of <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> went into its creation. In Serbia, as well as in neighboring countries, there are festivals dedicated to pies. One of them, called the Gibanica festival or Days of Banitsa, is held each year in Bela Palanka. It first took place in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Many {{forms of}} <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> contain sodium {{bicarbonate}} combined with calcium acid phosphate, sodium aluminium phosphate or cream of tartar.

25|$|Chametz {{does not}} include baking soda, <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> or like products. Although these are defined in English as {{leavening}} agents, they leaven by chemical reaction, not by biological fermentation. Thus, bagels, waffles and pancakes made with baking soda and matzo meal are considered permissible, while bagels made with sourdough and pancakes and waffles made with yeast are prohibited.|$|E
5000|$|Most commercially {{available}} <b>baking</b> <b>powders</b> {{are made up}} of sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking soda or bicarbonate of soda) and one or more acid salts. Typical formulations (by weight) call for 30% sodium bicarbonate, 5-12% monocalcium phosphate, and 21-26% sodium aluminum sulfate. The last two ingredients are acidic: they combine with the sodium bicarbonate and water to produce the gaseous carbon dioxide. The use of two acidic components is the basis of the term [...] "double acting." [...] Another typical acid in such formulations is cream of tartar, a derivative of tartaric acid. <b>Baking</b> <b>powders</b> also include components to help with the consistency and stability of the mixture.|$|R
5000|$|The acidic sodium {{aluminium}} phosphates {{are used}} as acids for <b>baking</b> <b>powders</b> for the chemical leavening of baked goods. Upon heating, SAlP combines with the baking soda to give carbon dioxide. Most of its action occurs at baking temperatures, rather than when the dough or batter is mixed at room temperature. SAlPs are advantageous because they impart a neutral flavor.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, with <b>baking</b> <b>powders</b> that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate, excess {{alkaline}} substances can sometimes deprotonate the acid in two steps {{instead of the}} one that normally occurs, resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods. Calcium compounds and aluminium compounds do not have that problem though, since calcium compounds that deprotonate twice are insoluble and aluminium compounds do not deprotonate in that fashion.|$|R
25|$|Commercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg {{replacer}} and Ener-G egg replacer, {{are available}} for cooking and baking. The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one tablespoon of flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water. For pancakes a tablespoon of <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> can be used instead of eggs. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one tablespoon of soy flour and one tablespoon of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a tablespoon of vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water, and half a tablespoon of <b>baking</b> <b>powder.</b> Silken (soft) tofu and mashed potato can also be used. Recently, aquafaba has come into use as a popular egg replacement, it can even be whipped up like egg whites.|$|E
25|$|The Tattie scone is {{a popular}} Scottish dish {{containing}} potatoes. Colcannon is a traditional Irish food made with mashed potato, shredded kale or cabbage, and onion; champ is a similar dish. Boxty pancakes are eaten throughout Ireland, although associated especially with the north, and in Irish diaspora communities; they are traditionally made with grated potatoes, soaked to loosen the starch and mixed with flour, buttermilk and <b>baking</b> <b>powder.</b> A variant eaten and sold in Lancashire, especially Liverpool, is made with cooked and mashed potatoes.|$|E
25|$|Soda alum, , mainly {{occurs in}} nature as the mineral mendozite. It is very soluble in water, and is {{extremely}} difficult to purify. In the preparation of this salt, it is preferable to mix the component solutions in the cold, and to evaporate them at a temperature not exceeding 60°C. 100 parts of water dissolve 110 parts of sodium alum at 0°C, and 51 parts at 16°C. Soda alum is used in the acidulent of food {{as well as in the}} manufacture of <b>baking</b> <b>powder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Small but {{significant}} amounts of adipic acid are used as a food ingredient as a flavorant and gelling aid. [...] It is used in some calcium carbonate antacids to make them tart. As an acidulant in <b>baking</b> <b>powders,</b> it avoids the undesireable hygroscopic properties of tartaric acid. [...] Adipic acid, rare in nature, does occur naturally in beets, {{but this is not}} an economical source for commerce compared to industrial synthesis.|$|R
50|$|Some acid salts {{are used}} in baking. They are found in <b>baking</b> <b>powders</b> and are {{typically}} divided into low-temperature (or single-acting) and high-temperature (or double-acting) acid salts. Common low-temperature acid salts react at room temperature to produce a leavening effect. They include cream of tartar, calcium phosphate, and citrates. High-temperature acid salts produce a leavening effect during baking and are usually aluminium salts such as calcium aluminium phosphate. Some acid salts may {{also be found in}} non-dairy coffee creamers.|$|R

25|$|A light batter {{is made of}} {{cold water}} (sometimes {{sparkling}} water is used to keep the batter light) and soft wheat flour (cake, pastry or all-purpose flour). Eggs, baking soda or <b>baking</b> <b>powder,</b> starch, oil, and/or spices may also be added. Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks {{for only a few}} seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in the unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice, or by placing the bowl inside a larger bowl with ice in it. Overmixing the batter will result in activation of wheat gluten, which causes the flour mixture to become soft and dough-like when fried.|$|E
25|$|American waffles vary significantly. Generally denser {{and thinner}} than the Belgian waffle, {{they are often}} made from a batter leavened with <b>baking</b> <b>powder,</b> which is {{sometimes}} mixed with pecans, chocolate drops or berries and may be round, square, or rectangular in shape. Like American pancakes they are usually served as a sweet breakfast food, topped with butter and maple syrup, bacon, and other fruit syrups, honey, or powdered sugar. They are also found in many different savory dishes, such as fried chicken and waffles or topped with kidney stew. They may also be served as desserts, topped with ice cream and various other toppings. A large chain (over 2,100 locations) of waffle specialty diners, Waffle House, is ubiquitous in the southern United States.|$|E
25|$|To raise revenue, Congress {{significantly}} raised {{tariffs on}} tea and coffee. Profits on these products declined; around 1880 A started to sell sugar in its stores. The company continued aggressive growth and by 1884 operated stores as far west as Kansas City {{and as far}} south as Atlanta. The company also operated wagon routes to serve rural customers. About this time, two of Hartford's sons, George (1864–1957) and John (1872–1951), joined the firm. A lore is that George convinced his father to expand the product line to include A <b>baking</b> <b>powder.</b> Over the next decade, the company added other A products, such as condensed milk, spices, and butter. As it expanded its offerings, the tea company was gradually creating the first grocery chain. By 1900, the firm had sales of $5 million from 198 stores as well as its mail order and wagon route operations. However, other grocery chains were expanding more rapidly and blanketing their respective areas while the tea company's stores were spread over a much larger area. A quickly found itself at a disadvantage.|$|E
50|$|Since {{chemical}} {{expertise is}} required to create a functional chemical leaven without producing off-flavors from the chemical precursors involved, such substances are often mixed into premeasured combinations for maximum results. These are generally referred to as <b>baking</b> <b>powders.</b> Sour milk and carbonates {{were used in the}} 1800s. The breakthrough in chemical leavening agents occurred in the 1930s with the introduction of monocalcium phosphates (Ca(H2PO4)2). Other leavening agents developed include sodium aluminium sulfate (NaAl(SO4)2·12H2O), disodium pyrophosphate (Na2H2P2O7), and sodium aluminium phosphates (NaH14Al3(PO4)8·4H2O and Na3H15Al2(PO4)8). These compounds combine with sodium bicarbonate to give carbon dioxide in a predictable manner.|$|R

500|$|The old-fashioned {{doughnut}} {{is a type}} of cake doughnut, and {{has been}} described as a [...] "subset" [...] of the cake doughnut. The cake doughnut itself originated in the United States circa 1829, when the increased availability of pearlash in the U.S., a type of leavener that preceded <b>baking</b> <b>powder,</b> lent to the increase of cake doughnut consumption. It is unclear when the old-fashioned doughnut itself was invented, but this very likely occurred after the cake doughnut was invented. Prior to circa 1829, doughnuts were typically the yeast-risen variety in the U.S. Circa the 1830s, the leaveners baking soda and <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> began to be available to U.S. consumers, which is around the same time that cake doughnut recipes first appeared in U.S. cookbooks.|$|E

5000|$|Pez {{was first}} marketed as a {{compressed}} peppermint sweet in Vienna, Austria in 1927 by Eduard Haas III. The name PEZ is an abbreviation of PfeffErminZ (German for peppermint). Haas created the peppermints using family owned <b>baking</b> <b>powders,</b> {{and decided to}} serve the mints in small, hand-size containers. He manufactured a small tin to hold the mints, similar to the modern Altoids tins. The first Pez mint dispensers, known as [...] "regulars," [...] were similar in shape to a cigarette lighter, and dispensed an adult breath mint marketed {{as an alternative to}} smoking. They were invented by Oscar Uxa. Haas Food Manufacturing Corporation of Vienna was the first to sell Pez products.|$|R
2500|$|Fumaric acid {{has been}} used as a food {{acidulant}} since 1946. It is approved for use as a food additive in the EU, USA and Australia and New Zealand. As a food additive, it is used as an acidity regulator and can be denoted by the E number E297. It is generally used in beverages and <b>baking</b> <b>powders</b> for which requirements are placed on purity. It is generally used as a substitute for tartaric acid and occasionally in place of citric acid, at a rate of 1g of fumaric acid to every ~1.5g of citric acid, in order to add sourness, similarly to the way malic acid is used. As well as being a component of some artificial vinegar flavors, such as [...] "Salt and Vinegar" [...] flavored potato chips, it is also used as a coagulant in stovetop pudding mixes.|$|R
30|$|Due to high acidity and solubility, MCPM {{is never}} found in {{biological}} calcifications. Moreover, pure MCPM is not biocompatible with bones (Köster et al. 1977). However, in medicine MCPM {{is used as}} a component of several self-hardening CaPO 4 formulations (Huan and Chang 2009; Dorozhkin 2013 b). In addition, MCPM {{is used as a}} nutrient, acidulant and mineral supplement for food, feed and some beverages (Budavari et al. 1996; Stein et al. 2008). Coupled with NaHCO 3, MCPM is used as a leavening agent for both dry <b>baking</b> <b>powders</b> and bakery dough. MCPM might be added to salt-curing preserves, pickled and marinated foods. In addition, MCPM might be added to tooth pastes and chewing gums (Dorozhkin 2013 c). Besides, MCPM might be added to ceramics and glasses, while agriculture is the main consumer of a technical grade MCPM, where it is used as a fertilizer, triple superphosphate (Nasri et al. 2015).|$|R
