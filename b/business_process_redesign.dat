40|$|Modelling and {{analysis}} of the quantitative performance of <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> {{plays an important role in}} different stages of <b>business</b> <b>process</b> re-engineering (BPR). Although simulation is used in most model-based BPRapproaches to obtain performance measures, in many cases analytic performance prediction techniques are preferable. Two aspects which are often distinguished in <b>business</b> <b>process</b> modelling are the (static) organisation structure and the (dynamic) behaviour. Certain hybrid performance analysis methods, originating from the field of parallel computer modelling, combine modelling languages which closely correspond with these two aspects. An additional advantage of hybrid techniques opposed to more traditional performance modelling techniques is that they occupy a favourable position on the trade-off between prediction accuracy and analytical efficiency. We describe such a technique, and show how it can be used for the analysis of <b>business</b> <b>processes.</b> INTRODUCTION <b>Redesign</b> of bus [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we have {{proposed}} a methodology towards improved <b>business</b> <b>process</b> model <b>redesign</b> based on QoS. We have extended an existing framework that generates an exhaustive space of process models from a set of capability library. The solution space is pruned based on goal and constraints considered thereafter. An algebraic framework is deployed that permits integrated multi-dimensional assessments of QoS factors for choosing path from the reduced space towards derivation of an optimal <b>business</b> <b>process</b> model by comparing the QoS values on both quantitative and qualitative scales. The proposed methodology ensures that while deriving a solution, no possible superior <b>business</b> <b>process</b> model is left out. Further, the designs that do not satisfy the given constraints are eliminated. Eventually, the extended and improved framework provides a comprehensive, both syntactically and semantically correct, consistent and improved <b>business</b> <b>process</b> that adheres to the target business goals and constraints specific to a business house.

40|$|Abstract. Current {{approaches}} to <b>business</b> <b>process</b> definition using various modeling techniques allow business rules and alternate scenarios {{to be captured}} {{as part of the}} main <b>business</b> <b>process</b> logic. But this approach leaves the business experts/process owners with little flexibility to manage and control <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> which are subjected to dynamic changes in the business environment. Allowing the <b>business</b> <b>process</b> to evolve in an agile manner requires flexibility in the <b>business</b> <b>process</b> definition. In this paper we propose modeling methods which can be used to capture the flexibility dimensions of a <b>business</b> <b>process.</b> The aim is to define elements of flexibility and model these elements separately from the process logic at different levels of abstraction. This will help in designing a flexible business support system and also assist in analysis of the <b>business</b> <b>process</b> during <b>process</b> <b>redesign.</b> Further this approach provides the organization with an environment in which rapid changes in processes can be implemented effectively. We provide guidelines to apply the proposed methods for different requirements of flexibility in processes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} and motivate {{the use of}} structural and quantitative perspectives on <b>business</b> <b>process</b> modelling and analysis.

40|$|Abstract—Information Security Standards such as NIST SP 800 - 39 and ISO/IEC 27005 : 2011 {{are turning}} their scope towards <b>business</b> <b>process</b> security. And rightly so, as {{introducing}} an infor-mation security control into a business-processing environment {{is likely to}} affect <b>business</b> <b>process</b> flow, while <b>redesigning</b> a <b>business</b> <b>process</b> will most certainly have security implications. Hence, in this paper, we investigate {{the similarities and differences}} between <b>Business</b> <b>Process</b> Management (BPM) and Information Security Management (ISM), and explore the obstacles and opportunities for integrating the two concepts. We compare three levels of abstraction common for both approaches; top-level implementa-tion strategies, organizational risk views & associated tasks, and domains. With some minor differences, the comparisons shows that there is a strong similarity in the implementation strategies, organizational views and tasks of both methods. The domain comparison shows that ISM maps to the BPM domains; however, some of the BPM domains have only limited support in ISM...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine whether}} {{cooperative}} planning and uncertainty affect {{the magnitude of}} rework in concurrent engineering projects with upstream and downstream operations, and explore the impact of such rework on project delays. Using survey data from a sample of 120 <b>business</b> <b>process</b> (BP) <b>redesign</b> and related information technology (IT) development projects in healthcare and telecommunications, our results indicate that upstream (BP) rework and downstream (IT) rework is mediated and mitigated by cooperative planning through upstream/downstream strategy coupling and cross-functional involvement. In addition, uncertainty related {{to a lack of}} firm or industry experience with such projects increases the magnitude of upstream rework but not downstream rework or the amount of cooperative planning. After accounting for project scope, implementation horizon and whether delays are anticipated, we find that project delay is primarily influenced by the magnitude of downstream rework and downstream delay: the magnitude of both upstream and downstream rework significantly increases downstream delay, which significantly increases project delay. However, the magnitude of upstream rework does not directly affect project delay. These results suggest that project delay is under managerial control as cooperative planning is a managerial function that reduces downstream rework, while uncertainty from a lack of experience with the design affecting upstream rework is not directly under managerial control. concurrent design, uncertainty, coordination, cooperative planning, concurrent engineering, project management, delay, <b>process</b> <b>redesign,</b> rework...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Redesign of <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> is an {{activity}} fre-quently performed in modern organizations {{as a response}} to intrinsic and extrinsic change requirements. The way (methods, techniques, tools) a <b>process</b> is <b>redesigned</b> varies greatly with the process context. In contrast, involving stakeholders of a <b>process</b> in <b>process</b> <b>redesign</b> can be considered a common practice throughout organizations of all kinds. Hence, research and industry have only recently investigated the characteristics of collaboration in <b>process</b> <b>redesign</b> and the challenges that arise for software-support respectively. In this paper we will systematically describe findings from a case-study where we adapted a particular type of collaboration technology – a wiki engine – towards collaborative process modeling support and exposed it to a real-world setting.

5000|$|In the 1990s {{the term}} 'process' became a new {{productivity}} paradigm. Companies {{were encouraged to}} think in processes instead of functions and procedures.

40|$|The {{management}} of <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> {{in modern times}} is rapidly shifting towards being evidence-based. <b>Business</b> <b>process</b> evaluation indicators {{tend to focus on}} process performance only, neglecting the definition of indicators to evaluate other concerns of interest in different phases of the <b>business</b> <b>process</b> lifecycle.

The framework includes process performance indicators and indicators to assess whether <b>process</b> <b>redesign</b> best practices have been applied and to what extent.

50|$|The theory {{builds on}} human {{evolution}} ideas {{and has been}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} media richness theory. Media naturalness theory argues that since our Stone Age hominid ancestors have communicated primarily face-to-face, evolutionary pressures have {{led to the development of}} a brain that is consequently designed for that form of communication. Other forms of communication are too recent and unlikely to have posed evolutionary pressures that could have shaped our brain in their direction. Using communication media that suppress key elements found in face-to-face communication, as many electronic communication media do, thus ends up posing cognitive obstacles to communication. This is particularly the case in the context of complex tasks (e.g., <b>business</b> <b>process</b> <b>redesign,</b> new product development, online learning), because such tasks seem to require more intense communication over extended periods of time than simple tasks.|$|E
