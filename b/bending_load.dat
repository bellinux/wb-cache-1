25|$|The {{hip joint}} {{is unique in}} that it {{experiences}} combined mechanical loads. An axial load along the shaft of the femur results in compressive stress. <b>Bending</b> <b>load</b> at {{the neck of the}} femur causes tensile stress along {{the upper part of the}} neck and compressive stress along the lower part of the neck. While osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are associated with bone fracture as we age, these diseases are not the cause of the fracture alone. Low energy falls from standing are responsible for the majority of fractures in the elderly, but fall direction is also a key factor. Elderly tend to fall to the side as instead of forward, and the lateral hip and strikes the ground first. During a sideways fall, the chances of hip fracture see a 15-fold and 12-fold increase in elderly males and females, respectively.|$|E

50|$|If {{the angle}} {{standard}} taper fittings make with glassware is not perfectly set, {{the glass is}} extremely rigid and brittle, presenting a fracture risk on some setups. A ball and socket joining method allows some flexibility in the mating angles of the pieces being joined, which can be particularly important with heavy flasks or long pieces of glassware {{that would otherwise be}} difficult to support and potentially snap under bending loads. A common example of this is the collection flask on a rotary evaporator, whose weight increases significantly as it fills. A ball and socket allows the flask to plumb itself without placing a <b>bending</b> <b>load</b> on the joint. Such a socket might also be used on a larger, but more typical, distillation setup at the head and before the condenser.

While osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are associated with bone fracture as we age, these diseases are not the cause of the fracture alone.

Taking into account that falls were the leading cause of hip fracture, Hwang et al. studied how the manner in which a fall occurs affects the chances of hip fracture. In their study, they found three contributing factors, with fall direction being the strongest predictor. During a sideways fall, the chances of hip fracture see a 15-fold and 12-fold increase in elderly males and females, respectively. This is likely due to a mechanical load experienced by bones weakened by osteoporosis.|$|E

40|$|Crack {{initiation}} {{and extension}} characteristics of tension side, view side and compression side of ceramic/metal joints were investigated under cyclic <b>bending</b> <b>loading.</b> Location of cracks and propagations were investigated by SEM and X-ray compositional analysis methods. The {{stress and strain}} distribution under cyclic <b>bending</b> <b>loading</b> were investigated by FEM analysis. The results obtained are as follows. (1) Crack initiation occurred at ceramic/interlayer interface at the specimen corner under cyclic <b>bending</b> <b>loading.</b> The unstable fracture occurred from the interface crack. At the 84 〜 90 % of mean strength, crack initiated at ceramic/interlayer interface at the specimen corner. (2) After a main crack occurred many microcracks appeared in order near the main crack region {{with the increase of}} maximum stress. Finally they united to the main crack under cyclic loading. The length of crack was increased with increasing maximum stress. The curve slopes of crack lengths versus stresses also increased with increasing maximum stress. Under constant cyclic <b>bending</b> <b>loading,</b> the cracks intermittently grew. (3) At compression side, when the absolute value of maximum stresses were higher than those of tension side, cracks started on the ceramic/interlayer interface and grew up to about 40 μm, and finally halted. (4) The crack initiations occurred at the ceramic/brazing filler interface. The location of crack initiation under cyclic <b>bending</b> <b>loading</b> was same as monotonic strength. (5) The crack length increment was decelerated with increasing energy release rate, then increased. The difference of the relationship between crack length increment and energy release rate was less than that of crack length increment and maximum stress. (6) From the FEM analysis, the plastic deformation progressed in interlayer when specimen was loaded and the plastic strain of interlayer left when unloaded. In the interlayer of interface, as compressional plastic strain was constrained by materials around it, tensile residual stresses occured at the compression side at end of unloading. That is why crack initiation occurred in the compression side...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{a failure}} {{criterion}} applicable to large strain Finite Element Analysis (FEA) results was proposed {{in order to}} predict both the fracture mode (collapse or cracking) and the limit <b>bending</b> <b>load</b> of wall-thinned straight pipes. This work was motivated from the recent experimental results of Tsuji and 	Meshii (2011); that is, fracture mode is not always collapse, and the fracture mode affects the limit <b>bending</b> <b>load.</b> The key finding in comparing their test results and a detailed large strain FEA results was that the Mises stress distribution at the limit <b>bending</b> <b>load</b> of a flawed cylinder {{was similar to that}} of a flawless cylinder; specifically, in case of collapse, the Mises stress exceeded the true yield stress of a material for the whole “volume” of a cylinder with a nominal wall thickness. Based on this finding, a failure criterion applicable to large strain FEA results of wall-thinned straight pipes *Title Page 2 under a <b>bending</b> <b>load</b> that can predict both fracture mode and limit <b>bending</b> <b>load</b> was proposed and was named the Domain Collapse Criterion (DCC). DCC predicts the limit <b>bending</b> <b>load</b> as the lower value of either the Mc FEA, which is the load at which the Mises stress exceeds the true yield strength 	of a straight pipe for the whole “volume” with a nominal wall thickness (fracture mode: collapse), or the Mc FEAb, which is the load at which the Mises stress in a section of the flaw ligament exceeds the true tensile stress (fracture mode: cracking). The results showed that the DCC could predict the fracture mode appropriately and the experimental limit <b>bending</b> <b>load</b> fundamentally on the conservative side within a maximum 20 % difference regardless of the fracture mode. Another advantage of the DCC is that it uses the true yield and true tensile strength as the critical strength of the material and not the ambiguous flow strength...|$|E
