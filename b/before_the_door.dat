Joseph Williams defended a small window, and 14 dead Zulus were later found beneath that window. As it became clear {{the front of the}} building was being taken over by Zulus, John Williams began to hack a way of escape through the wall dividing the central room and a corner room {{in the back of the}} hospital. As he made a passable breach, the door into the central room came under furious attack from the Zulus, and he only had time to drag two bedridden patients out <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> gave way.|$|E
500|$|The {{quote from}} Revelation, [...] "" [...] (See, I stand <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and knock), is given as a recitative to the bass as the [...] (voice of Christ). The {{knocking}} on the door is expressed by [...] chords in the strings. Dürr notes: [...] "The most expressive text-engendered declamation is here ingeniously melted down into a structure only ten bars long but of compelling musical logic." [...] John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, compares it to an Emmaus scene in Bach's later cantata Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden, BWV 6, the [...] "post-Resurrection appearance to the disciples" [...] in Halt im Gedächtnis Jesum Christ, BWV 67, even to [...] "the entry of the Commendatore in Mozart’s opera Don Giovanni. Bach would later frequently use the bass as the voice of Christ, in his St Matthew Passion even with a similar string accompaniment.|$|E
2500|$|After her arrest, she {{was held}} at an annex to the Old Capitol Prison before being {{transferred}} to the Washington Arsenal on April 30. Two armed guards stood <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to her cell {{from the beginning of}} her imprisonment until her death. Her cell, while airy and larger than the others, was sparsely furnished, with a straw mattress, table, wash basin, chair, and a bucket. Food was served four times a day, always of bread; salt pork, beef, or beef soup; and coffee or water. The other arrested conspirators had their heads enclosed in a padded canvas bag to prevent a suicide attempt. Sources disagree as to whether Surratt was forced to wear it as well. Although the others wore iron manacles on their feet and ankles, she was not manacled. (Rumors to the contrary were raised by reporters at the trial who could not see her or [...] "heard" [...] the clank of chains about her feet. The rumors were repeatedly investigated and denied.) She began to suffer menstrual bleeding and became weak during her detention. She was given a rocking chair and allowed visits from her daughter, Anna. She and Powell received the most attention from the press. The Northern press was also highly critical of her.|$|E
