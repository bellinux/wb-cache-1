Phase change materials came {{into the center of}} attention for applications in nonvolatile memories, where further developments focus on an increase in memory capacity, particularly since <b>battery-buffered</b> electronics have become more and more popular. The influence of process parameter variation on composition is studied with the aim of adjusting the stoichiometry to Ge 1 Sb 2 Te 4, Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 and Ge 1 Sb 4 Te 7. Ge-Sb-Te belongs to the homologous series (GeTe) n(Sb 2 Te 3) m, which is the reason why a change in stoichiometry leads to a variation in the ratio of the single units (GeTe) and (Sb 2 Te 3). Structural investigation documents, that the homologous series (GeTe) m(Sb 2 Te 3) m is characterized as a stacked system of single units consisting of alternating cation and anion layers stacked in [0001]-direction (c-direction) separated by Te-Te-layers, whereat the number of cation and anion layers is dependent on stoichiometry. An alternative precursor combination is also tested for its suitability for deposition at lower reactor temperatures. Furthermore, first deposition experiments on structured Si substrates have also shown that selective growth is possible. In particular, the growth of structures in lateral direction is promising for future electrical characterization...|$|E
