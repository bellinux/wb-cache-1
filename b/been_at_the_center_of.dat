25|$|Because it is a high-performing and well-regarded school, Boston Latin has <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> {{controversy}} concerning its admissions process.

Before the 1997 school year, Boston Latin set aside a 35% quota of places in its incoming class for under-represented minorities. The school was forced to drop this policy after a series of lawsuits involving non-minority girls who were not admitted despite ranking higher than admitted minorities.|$|E

Despite his release, several journalists remain jailed for alleged contact with the rebels, and at least three radio stations (Nigeriens main source of news) have been closed by the authorities.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{hardcore}} punk was developing primarily in Southern California and Washington, D.C. The New York hardcore scene {{was founded by}} 1981, and bands such as Reagan Youth and Kraut led the initial charge. By 1985, the New York hardcore scene had become inhabited by straight edgers and skinheads, including bands such as Agnostic Front, Cro-Mags, Heart Attack, Youth of Today, The Plasmatics, Warzone, and Murphy's Law. With {{the collapse of the}} CBGB hardcore matinees due to constant violence, a more activist DIY scene began to develop around ABC No Rio and the squats of the Lower East Side. New York has <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the United States third wave ska scene. The founders of third wave ska, which drew on British Two-Tone ska, were New York bands such as the Toasters and Urban Blight. In the early 1980s, Toasters singer/guitarist and songwriter Robert 'Bucket' Hingley established Moon Ska Records; the label operated until the late 1990s, giving many ska bands from New York and elsewhere international exposure. Some of the other ska bands to come from the New York scene were Skinnerbox, The Slackers, and Mephiskapheles. Other major hardcore punk bands from New York are Sick of It All, H2O, and Madball. There are also ska-jazz bands, such as the New York Ska Jazz Ensemble.|$|E
500|$|In politics, Victor L.

500|$|Epaminondas's {{actions were}} {{certainly}} welcomed by the Messenians and others whom he assisted in his campaigns against the Spartans. [...] Those same Spartans, however, had <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> {{resistance to the}} Persian invasions of the 5th century BC, and their absence was sorely felt at Chaeronea; the endless warfare in which Epaminondas {{played a central role}} weakened the cities of Greece until they could no longer hold their own against their neighbors to the north. As Epaminondas campaigned to secure freedom for the Boeotians and others throughout Greece, he brought closer the day when all of Greece would be subjugated by an invader. Victor Davis Hanson has suggested that Epaminondas may have planned for a united Greece composed of regional democratic federations, but even if this assertion is correct, no such plan was ever implemented. Simon Hornblower asserts that Thebes' great legacy to fourth century and Hellenistic Greece was federalism, [...] "a kind of alternative to imperialism, a way of achieving unity without force", which [...] "embodies a representative principle".|$|E
500|$|Marceline has {{attracted}} positive critical attention. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club praised {{that the fact}} that she is one [...] "of this show‚Äôs most tragic characters".

[...] Furthermore, he noted that [...] "she‚Äôs <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> some of the show‚Äôs most emotional episodes", and [...] "beyond her dramatic value, Marceline tends to just make every episode better" [...] because [...] "her writers clearly enjoy writing scenes for her". Susana Polo of The Mary Sue referred to the character as [...] "one of the radder characters" [...] in the series. Cam Shea of IGN named Marceline's introduction in [...] "Evicted!" [...] as the fourth best moment in the series' first season. He wrote that [...] "sure, in this episode she evicts Finn and Jake from their home ... but hey, this is the first time we meet her and she's awesome." ...|$|E
500|$|The Whopper has <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> several hoaxes and pranks {{from the}} company. In a 1998 April Fool's Day prank, Burger King {{took out a}} full page {{advertisement}} in several national publications such as USA Today advertising {{a new version of}} the sandwich called the [...] "Left-Handed Whopper". The advertisement claimed that the condiments were all rotated 180¬∞ to accommodate southpaws. Another prank from 2013 claimed that the company was introducing a [...] "hands-free Whopper holder" [...] to allow people to eat the sandwich while doing other activities. The unit, similar to a harmonica holder, was supposed to be introduced in Puerto Rico to celebrate the company's 50th anniversary. It was later revealed to be a joke. A 2007 advertising campaign celebrating the golden anniversary of the Whopper showed real customers in Las Vegas reacting to the false news the Whopper has been discontinued. While it was not permanently discontinued, the ad claims it was discontinued for one day. Later versions of the ads had customers receiving a Big Mac or Wendy's Single and their reactions to the sandwich. In-store ads, such as posters and tray-liners, attack the size and quality of the Big Mac. The campaign won the 2009 Effie Award as one of the best restaurant advertising promotions for 2007‚Äì2008.|$|E
