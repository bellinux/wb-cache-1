Fractional transport rates were also {{measured at the}} beginning of each run when the bed was well mixed and planar. The start-up observations allow us to describe the variation of fractional transport rates with bed shear stress for a constant bed surface texture and <b>bed</b> <b>configuration.</b> The start-up and equilibrium observations together allow, for the first time, an unambiguous description of the mutual adjustment among the transport, the <b>bed</b> <b>configuration,</b> and the bed surface, as the transport system moves toward equilibrium. We find that a substantial interaction exists among the transport, bed surface, and <b>bed</b> <b>configuration.</b> Bed forms and a coarse surface layer coexist over a range of bed shear stress. Under some flow conditions the size and shape of the bed forms are controlled by the presence of the coarse surface layer. At higher flows the coarse surface layer is eliminated by scour in the lee of the bed forms. If the bed surface is defined as that over which the bed forms move, a coherent relation between the bed surface texture and the transport grain size distribution may be defined. At equilibrium the transport rates of all fractions were not equally mobile, defined as identical transport and bed grain size distributions, although equal mobility was approached for runs in which the bed shear stress was more than twice that for initial motion of the mixture. Under some flow conditions the transport was observed to adjust away from equal mobility as the bed adjusted from a well-mixed start-up condition to an equilibrium state. Development of a partial static armor, wherein some individual grains become essentially immobile even though other grains in the same fraction remain in transport, is suggested to explain these adjustments between the transport and bed surface grain size distributions. Constraints on equilibrium mixed size sediment transport are defined. The special conditions for which equal mobility must hold and the relevance to natural conditions of flume results and the equal mobility concept are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Particulate density currents, such as {{pyroclastic}} {{flows and}} turbidity currents, {{are prone to}} flow in a supercritical state, due to their small density difference {{in relation to the}} ambient fluid. Facies deposited in supercritical-flow conditions are therefore likely to be common, yet their recognition and analysis remain difficult in the stratigraphic record. This is commonly ascribed to the poor preservation potential of deposits from high-energy supercritical flows. However, the number of documented flume datasets on supercritical-flow dynamics and sedimentary structures is very limited compared to available experiments on subcritical flows, and our inability to identify and interpret such deposits might also be due to insufficient knowledge. This work presents the results of systematic experiments spanning the full range of supercritical-flow bedforms (antidunes, chutes-and-pools, cyclic steps) developed over mobile sand beds of variable grain sizes. Flow character and related bedform patterns are constrained through time-series measurements of <b>bed</b> <b>configurations,</b> flow depths, flow velocities and Froude numbers. The results allow the refinement and extension of current bedform stability diagrams in the supercritical-flow domain. Sedimentary structures associated with the development of supercritical bedforms under variable aggradation rates are revealed by means of a synthetic aggradation technique and compared with examples from field and flume studies. Image sequences show the direct coupling of flow processes, <b>bed</b> <b>configurations</b> and resultant sedimentary structures for selected supercritical bedforms. Aggradation rate, which is highly variable in pyroclastic events, is observed to bear an important influence on the geometry of supercritical-flow structures, and it should be held in consideration for the identification and mutual distinction of supercritical bedforms in the volcaniclastic record...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, sand-filled {{geotextile}} bags (geobags) {{have become}} a popular means of long-term riverbank protection. However, the associated failure mechanisms of geobag revetments are still not well understood. Three interactions influence geobag performance, namely, geobag–geobag, geobag–water flow, and geobag–water flow–riverbank interactions. To enhance the fundamental understanding {{of the performance of}} geobags in a revetment, a laboratory experimental program has been undertaken using both a fixed bed and a mobile sediment bed. In the experimental study, 600 bags were used to construct geobag revetments, and failure modes were observed for these two <b>bed</b> <b>configurations.</b> In general, there were some common trends for both <b>bed</b> <b>configurations</b> (i. e., uplifting, turbulent bursting–induced flow through the revetment voids, overtopping, pulling out, and/or internal sliding), but in the mobile bed case, toe scouring had a significant negative influence on geobag performance. To extend the laboratory measured hydraulic parameters, the conveyance estimation system (CES) was used. A CES model was validated against fixed-bed experimental observations, and the validated model was then used to predict mobile-bed formations. The CES bed predictions were used to produce a failure diagram under geobag–water flow interactions and classification of bed formation under geobag–water flow–riverbank interactions. It is concluded that the CES can be a useful and computationally efficient tool for the prediction of hydraulic parameters and bed formations. In the next phase of the research, observations from the experimental program will be used to validate a discrete element model of a geobag revetment, which will be used to help develop much-needed geobag revetment design guidance...|$|R
