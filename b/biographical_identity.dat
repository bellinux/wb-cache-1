40|$|This article {{draws on}} the framing {{perspective}} to analyze identity construc-tion. Based on the analysis of thirty in-depth interviews with members of a Spanish environmental movement organization, the author demonstrates how activists construct their identities and frame their personal experience. On one hand, activists align their personal identities with larger conceptions of group identity. On the other, they frame the uniqueness of personal expe-rience in a biographical story that sustains their activism. The author analyz-es how these two aspects come together in practice through several identity construction processes. Specifically, she examines how identity extension and identity transformation account for self-construction, and elaborate a third process, which she calls <b>biographical</b> <b>identity</b> integration. <b>Biographical</b> <b>identity</b> integration fills an analytical gap in the framing literature and sheds at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 18, 2016 jce. sagepub. comDownloaded from 2 Journal of Contemporary Ethnography XX(X...|$|E

Our article aims to contribute to this research area by focusing on how adolescents’ narration of their schooling frames their life planning. In particular, we explore a major finding of our research—namely, their defending of vocational training—by means {{of the notion of}} ambivalent <b>biographical</b> <b>identity.</b> We argue (a) that today’s adolescents do not openly reject vocational training, and they try to transform the unofficial skills and knowledge obtained in their cultures into official cultural capital capable of making them enter the job market and (b) that their life planning is tied up with a <b>biographical</b> <b>identity</b> formation through which they try to coherently reconcile their embodied cultures with the vocational qualifications they aspire to acquire...|$|E

Through detailed analyses of data generated through a school ethnography, this paper demonstrates the processes through which African-Caribbean students are identified as undesirable, or even intolerable, learners. The paper builds on the insights offered by earlier school ethnographies while deploying and developing a new theoretical framework. This framework suggests that the discursive practices of students and teachers contribute to the performative constitution of intelligible selves and others.

The most profound of these are the temporary absence, and permanent loss, of their mothers. Eighteen young women (aged 18 – 34) from rural Victoria (Australia), with family histories of breast cancer, were interviewed for this study. The data were analyzed using hermeneutic Heideggerian phenomenology to explore their lived experiences. Our findings reveal the long term and pervasive consequences of relational distress associated with the temporary and permanent loss of mothers. This distress is experienced through disruptions to developmental attachment and embodied and <b>biographical</b> <b>identity.</b> We highlight how familial breast cancer extends beyond genetic inheritance to encompass the relational distress of loss and grief. We conclude by highlighting the importance of considering the ways in which temporality, self-identity, and daughters' ways of seeing themselves are significantly altered by their mothers' cancer experience...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of memory {{in the movie}} "Memento" The paper deals {{with the question of}} the construction and the ways of the {{construction of}} memory in the movie "Memento". Therefore, second chapter gives theoretical approach to memory and identity. First, we refer on Maurice Halbwachs' distinction between historical and autobiographical memory and then - refering on work of Jean-Claude Kaufman - we talk about history of concept of identity and we introduce distinction between biographical and immediate identity. Third chapter shows how Leonard Shelby, the character in the movie, constructs his memory after his wife's death and after he had lost his memory. Here we suggest that Leonard, after his wife died, had lost his <b>biographical</b> <b>identity</b> and all that he has is immediate identity. So, he must construct his memory, but not as an autobiographical, but as a historical memory. In that mission he uses notes, tattoos and pictures. Also, here we suggest that his construction of memory is false construction. In the fourth chapter we explain the case of Leonard Shelby through the theoretical frame of psychoanalysis. After we introduce theoretical distinctions between mimetic and anti-mimetic register of trauma and between Freud's unconscious and pre-conscious, we then apply them on the Leonard's case. Here we show that everything what Leonard's preconscious and anti-mimetic register have made was negated by his unconscious and mimetic register of trauma. In the end, we conclude that Leonard actually doesn't want to remember...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the scholarly study of Sir Thomas Malory’s Le Morte Darthur, especially {{the way in}} which the field has been shaped by the discovery of the Winchester MS in 1934. Owing to the complex relationship between the manuscript and the printed edition of 1485, both contradictory and co-dependent, Le Morte seems to invite a number of narratives regarding its origins and originality while simultaneously foreclosing definitive resolution. Two issues have dominated the scholarly study of Le Morte after 1934 : the search for the <b>biographical</b> <b>identity</b> of its author, and the scholarly disagreement about textual unity. Section one of this thesis {{examines the}} critical understanding of how the book relates to its mysterious author and its highly influential French source-texts. The first two chapters investigate critical co-readings of Le Morte with the life-records of three different authorship candidates. Chapter 3 analyses the tension between textual criticism and literary interpretation which underpins the disagreement between Eugène Vinaver and C. S. Lewis in their discussion of authorship and textual meaning. Section two investigates the complex relation between the two textual witnesses to Malory’s work. Whereas chapter 4 demonstrates that a stemmatic approach to the search for originality and origins is highly problematic, chapter 5 shows how other narratives of origins and originality are equally facilitated and foreclosed. Chapter 5 also examines the problem of ‘unity’ in Malory’s work. Chapter 6 is devoted to the Winchester MS and the narratives about its history and meaning. Section three looks at how the relationship between Malory and the scholarship around him has developed in the post-Winchester years. Critical perception of the work as requiring a simple reader for its true meaning to be revealed, examined in chapter 7, is held up against the notion that the book’s worthiness requires personal affinity or personal worthiness on the part of its critics, discussed in chapter 8. The final chapter investigates how the search for stability and origins is transferred from Malory and Le Morte to the scholars’ understanding of their own field and methodology...|$|E
40|$|Introduction to Early Modern Literary Studies: Special Issue 23) The {{collection}} of essays commemorates the 450 th anniversary {{of the birth of}} the early modern poet and dramatist, Christopher Marlowe. It arrives at a particularly vibrant moment in the history of Marlovian criticism and performance. But an anniversary brings with it a certain quality as well as quantity of attention. As a marking of the passage of time, it invites a retrospective examination, not just of the period of the subject’s life and work but of the course that work has taken in the intervening years; it begs the question, ‘what has happened to Marlowe’s work, and our sense of it, over the last four centuries?’ As the differing level of coverage of the Shakespearean and Marlovian aspects of this anniversary year demonstrate, it also represents an opportunity to consider the place that subject occupies in the popular imagination today. With this in mind, the present collection aims to contribute to the anniversary year’s Marlowe scholarship by examining his work and his influence diachronically; that is, it seeks to examine Marlowe’s work {{in the context of the}} material conditions of its production, but also seeks to illuminate the ways in which that work both responds to pre-existing literary traditions and contributes to the creations of new traditions long after the author’s death. Alongside consideration of what his work reveals about the ontology of the early modern soul, the understanding of the British Isles as a geographical space and the material proximity of open sewage to the public theatre, the essays in this collection also apply focus to Marlowe’s manipulation of his source material and to the ways in which subsequent writers — from the late sixteenth century to the early twenty-first — have appropriated and reconstructed Marlowe’s authorial and <b>biographical</b> <b>identity.</b> In so doing, the contributions to the collection cover a range of Marlowe’s texts including Tamburlaine the Great, Doctor Faustus, Edward II, Hero and Leander and the translations of the Amores, as well as considering the Marlovian implications of work by other authors, such as Ben Jonson’s Poetaster, Anthony Burgess’s A Dead Man in Deptford, Iain Sinclair and Dave McKean’s Slow Chocolate Autopsy and a selection of recent novels focusing on the apocryphal ‘School of Night’. At the end of the anniversary year, then, this collection considers Marlowe not just at, but across four-hundred-and-fifty years, from his upbringing and classical education to his continued resonance in contemporary fiction...|$|E
40|$|The {{theological}} {{doctrine of}} the immortal soul {{in the light of}} the discussion in neuroscience). In eight chapters, this work deals with the scientific results of the transition in theological and philosophical views from soul as material object to soul as mental object. The first chapter shows the development of the Christian concept of the soul, which in ancient Christian-Greco-Roman times is still largely influenced by Platon’s dualism. It was only since Augustine that it was able to shed Platon’s heritage. The concept of the soul from the era of Augustine shapes theology up to the early 13 th century. New aspects only arise with Thomas of Aquinas. The second chapter presents the Aristotelian-Thomistic “anima unica forma corporis” doctrine and its consequences for current theology. The third chapter discusses the understanding of the soul from the perspective of neuroscience and attempts to clarify in how far and under what circumstances this understanding is similar to the understanding of the soul from Christian tradition. Chapter four assesses the chances of solving the mind-body problem in the form of a comparison and assessment of monistic and dualistic theory. The result of this comparison returns the formula "dualism in ideology, monism in ontology", since even seemingly open approaches to an intellectual and spiritual acting force do in fact conceal monistic materialism. The fifth chapter evaluates why naturalism with its epistemological postulates is of little help to solve the body-soul problem. For this purpose, the theories presented in Chapter 4 are summarised under the category of "naturalism" in order to arrive at an evaluation. Naturalism’s formerly bold promise to overcome the body-soul problem could so far not be fulfilled by any of its varieties. The sixth chapter examines the relationship between naturalism and theology. According to the naturalistic ideal of science, theology is not deemed a science as the ideal requires naturalism as "belief" and thus excludes the idea of God. However, both knowledge disciplines base themselves on certain conditions. In its scientific reasoning, naturalism replaces the word "God" with the term "Nature". Despite all concerns against naturalism it is an important reference for criticism of theology when it prompts it not to evade answering its questions, e. g. relating to the creation of the soul. The seventh chapter: "Soul - what could it be?" transfers the previously acquired insights to a direct comparison of theological and naturalistic statements about the soul. For theology, the Bible serves as primary source of knowledge about the phylogenetic act of soul creation. The scientific explanation of this act draws upon the period from prehistory that holds evidence for hominids to have experienced a reference of transcendence or a "relation to God". The fusion of sperm and egg, itself the earliest moment of full personhood, is explained as ontogenetic or individual act of soul creation. Considering the constant change of the material body due to metabolism, naturally the body cannot be the bearer of the personal identity of a human being - this can only be ascribed to the soul. From the "perspective of the bereaved", physical death constitutes "Judgment Day". The earthly body decays while the soul preserves the personal and <b>biographical</b> <b>identity</b> of that human being. Death and completion take place “outside of time” in the same moment. The resurrection within death is not an alternative to the resurrection of the whole man on Judgement Day - it is rather identical to it. The eighth chapter is a summary of the work...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reveals that}} Ellerton Gay, {{who in the}} 1890 s {{published}} four novels about life in Australia, was the pseudonym of Emma Watts Grimes n饠Allen (1846 - 1921). Watts Grimes's trajectory from orphaned English migrant, to the wife of successful Toowoomba businessman, and - after her return to England in middle age - to a modestly successful writer demonstrates the transformative possibilities for women of migration to the colonies. She wrote not from economic necessity, but - on the internal evidence of the novels - as a woman whose colonial experience contributed to, rather than detracted from, her sense of herself as cultured, modern and cosmopolitan. The intersection of the pseudonymous and <b>biographical</b> <b>identities</b> {{is of particular interest}} because Ellerton Gay draws on the life experiences of her creator to flesh out the conventions of the romance genre in two settings, turn of the century England and nineteenth century Australia. Ellerton Gay's shorter fiction, which offers a humorous commentary on the English marriage market of the 1890 s, is rather slight and conventional. Her four novels, however, contribute to the reinterpretation of Australia's colonial past and the imagining of its future by showing that individual empowerment and social cohesion can only be achieved by embracing new moral and social codes. While Ellerton Gay will not displace Rosa Praed as the leading woman writer to emerge from colonial Queensland, the revelation of her identity solves a minor mystery, and thickens the texture of Queensland's cultural history.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{begins with}} a specific question: What can education learn from experiences of Black women teachers about meeting {{the educational needs of}} marginalized learners? It explores this question by focusing on the pedagogical practices five Canadian Black women teachers employ to meet the learning needs of their students, particularly those most marginalized and underserviced. While their voices are generally missing in Canadian educational research literature, the present inquiry is guided by an understanding that the teaching practices of Black women teachers are individualized and contextual; they encounter and develop professional expertise from many different subjective and educational trajectories, and they learn to teach students, on multiple terms and at varied levels of success. The research pursues three lines of investigation organized by the diverse experiences of Black women teacher respondents: (1) <b>biographical</b> and <b>identity</b> formation as teachers who are Black women; (2) attitudes, strategies and negotiations as ""minority"" teachers in a white majority profession; (3) and what matters most to these Black women about the academic success of marginalized students while teaching and interacting with them in the classroom. Drawing upon observations and interviews, insights from the teachers highlight the educational problematic as more about the long-standing ""teaching-gap"" than about challenges students present. The study yields recommendations toward closing this ""teaching gap"" to more generally improve educational provision to all students, and more specifically to marginalized students in Canadian schools. ...|$|R

As expected, the Preludes does not meet any of the above expectations towards a biographical novel, which proves that the work can be recognized as a postmodernist literary biography.

The study investigated the professional identity crisis the teachers faced {{as a result of an}} education reform, which affected their work environment. The <b>identity</b> <b>biographical</b> narrative approach was adopted as the theoretical framework (re) presented in the life stories told by the individuals. Ten biographical interviews were conducted and each interview was analyzed separately (using vertical or diachronic analysis) and, through content analysis, in a transversal perspective (horizontal or synchronic) with the categories which were determined as identity components. As a result of the transversal analysis a protocol guide was created, which was used as the basis for the discussion groups. By means of a sequential triangulation (MORSE, 1991), the ideographic and personal dimensions of the interview enabled us to have a detailed report which was later enhanced by the group perspective.

40|$|Objectives: {{to explore}} {{in the context}} of peoples’ {{personal}} social networks, the contribution that pets make to ‘the work’ associated with the management of long-term conditions. Method: mixed methods survey with nested parallel qualitative study; 300 participants were drawn from diabetes and chronic heart disease registers of General Practices across Greater Manchester in the North West of England. Notions of ‘work’ were used to describe the illness and everyday activities associated with chronic illness. Results: nineteen percent of participants identified at least one pet within their network. Pets contributed mostly to managing emotions (emotional work), to enhancing a sense of self <b>identity</b> (<b>biographical</b> work) {{and to a lesser extent}} practical tasks (everyday work). There were indicators that pets mediated relationships for people living with a long-term condition through very weak ties with others in domestic and community settings. Conclusion: the findings suggest that pets have unique qualities and are not simply substitutes for human relationships in long-term condition management. The study has potential implications for furthering a social contextual analysis of chronic illness, the understanding of relationships, and the meaning and the role of companion animals in long-term condition managemen...|$|R
40|$|Young {{people in}} the new century find {{themselves}} having to define their existential choices within a social landscape that is strongly characterized by the acceleration of change. Contemporary time seems to erase temporal continuity {{and the notion of}} the life-plan as developed in first modernity. The article analyses how this process impacts the biographical constructs of young people and how the changing experience of time affects the transition to adulthood and the spread of new values. The hypothesis is that the positive relation among life-plan, <b>biographical</b> time, and <b>identity</b> encounters difficulties when the future is shortened. Planning capacity is compromised and life-projects depend more on subjective factors than on completion of the canonical life-stages marked by institutional times-frames. As a result, young people “navigate by sight”, dealing with uncertainty, rather than following pre-established routes. But the redefinition of the relationship between identity and social time does not only consist in a growing focus on the present; it also implies a reconstruction of the relationship with the future.

40|$|The {{adolescent}} {{years are}} typically {{marked by the}} exploration of different roles and lifestyles with experience culminating into a crystallized sense of self (Chae, 2001). According to de Man, Harvey, Ward and Benoit (2008) adolescents who have achieved ego identity generally {{have higher levels of}} self-esteem and tend to be more decisive, self-directed, good at problem solving and able to cope with changing environmental demands. Currently {{there is a lack of}} identity research in South Africa that encompasses gender, self-esteem and academic achievement. The purpose of this research study sets about to fill such a gap. This study attempted to investigate the differences in males and females’ identity processing style in relation to academic achievement and self-esteem. A sample of 428 first year psychology students at a well known South African university participated in this study. A <b>biographical</b> questionnaire, the <b>Identity</b> Style Inventory (ISI- 3), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES) and 2009 June examination results were utilized. Findings of the study revealed no significant differences in males and females’ identity processing style in relation to academic achievement and self-esteem. There was however significant difference between the three identity processing styles, in favour of the Informational group on academic achievement. A significant difference was found between the gender groups only on the Normative variable in favour of the females. Implications for further theory and practice and recommendations for future research are provided...|$|R
40|$|Research on school-to-work {{transition}} has commonly {{relied on}} theories of individualisation or social reproduction. Young people on vocational pathways, in particular, are often {{depicted as a}} homogenous group of 'disaffected', second-chance learners, who are passively socialised into what are perceived as low-skilled jobs, suggesting abiding identities. Studies have tended to neglect the rich biographical experiences of young people and {{the complexity of the}} processes of identity construction. This thesis presents findings from a cross-national comparative study of apprentices in retail and motor vehicle maintenance in England and Germany, using a multi-method ethnographic approach combining biographical interviews with participant observation. It explores young people's construction of their (learner) identities over time and within the two main learning sites of apprenticeship - the workplace and the college. The contrast of contexts of the two countries illuminates the ways in which structures facilitate particular patterns and processes of transition and identity formation. Drawing on Judith Butler's work on performativity and on the biographical approach of Peter Alheit, the thesis argues that young people actively perform socially recognised identities, which they interpret in the contexts of their <b>biographical</b> experience. Learner <b>identities</b> are not natural or abiding, but are formed through concrete experiences of learning and are constituted in institutional settings and foaming cultures with discursive frameworks that prioritise certain forms of knowledge. Thus, young people may reject certain types of learning and may develop alternative learning careers which they reflexively negotiate. Apprenticeship, therefore, may be a positive choice. While vocational education in England is based on the academic/vocational dichotomy and assumptions that vocational learners reject all classroom learning, apprenticeships in Germany centre on the integration of theory and practice. The learner identities of young people in the two countries reflect these different discourses. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
