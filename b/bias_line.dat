40|$|In this article, a new λ/ 4 <b>bias</b> <b>line,</b> {{combined}} with a dumbbell shaped defected ground structure (DGS), is proposed to suppress harmonics in power amplifiers. The proposed <b>bias</b> <b>line</b> maintains the required high impedance after the DGS is inserted, while the width and length of the λ/ 4 <b>bias</b> <b>line</b> are broader and shorter than those of conventional bias lines in power amplifiers. When the proposed <b>bias</b> <b>line</b> is used in power amplifiers, the third {{as well as the}} second harmonics are reduced because of the increased slow-wave effect of the proposed <b>bias</b> <b>line</b> over a wide harmonic frequency band.

30|$|First, {{as shown}} in Fig.  3 a, on a high {{resistivity}} Si substrate (electrical resistivity:[*]>[*] 1  kΩ cm; diameter: 4  in.; thickness: 500  μm) with 1  μm thick thermal oxide film, the base metal layer composed of Ti/Au was deposited. The thicknesses of the Ti layer and the Au layer were 50  nm and 300  nm, respectively. The Ti layer functions as both an adhesion layer and a resistive <b>bias</b> <b>line.</b> We then formed the Au/CNT-composite layer as described in “Fabrication of Au/CNTs composite layer” section. The photoresist in Fig.  3 a was prepared for Au electroplating on the sprayed CNT layer. The photoresist in Fig.  3 a was then removed, and the base metal layers of Ti/Au were patterned. The Ti/Au layers were etched with the Ar ion beam etching (Ar IBE) technique. We then obtained the Ti resistive <b>bias</b> <b>line</b> after wet etching (etchant: AURUM- 304) of the Au layer on the <b>bias</b> <b>line</b> (Fig.  3 b). As shown in Fig.  3 c, a 1.5  μm thick Ni sacrificial layer was deposited by sputtering and then etched using the Ar IBE method. We then successively formed 0.75  μm deep dimples {{for the formation of}} contact points under the cantilever; the dimples were also fabricated by the Ar IBE method. The Au layer of the cantilever was formed by electroplating, {{as shown in}} Fig.  3 d. Before electroplating, a 100  nm thick Au seed layer was sputtered and a photoresist (PMER P-LA 900 PM) for electroplating was patterned. The electroplated Au layer thickness was 5  μm. Finally, we removed the photoresist for electroplating and used Ar IBE to etch the part of the Au seed layer not involved {{in the formation of the}} Au electroplating layer. The Ni sacrificial layer was then removed. To prevent contamination by organic compounds, hydrochloric acid and ferric chloride, which are inorganic etchants, were used to etch the Ni layer. After the Ni sacrificial layer was etched, the solvent was replaced with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and the CO 2 supercritical drying method was used to prevent stiction of the cantilever. In Fig.  3 e, the fabricated switch is described. The gap between the cantilever body and the lower contact layer was 1.5  μm; however, the distance from the contact point surface formed on the cantilever to the lower electrode was 0.75  μm as shown in magnified of Fig.  3 e.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the quantum versus classical dynamics of a microwave cavity-coupled-Cooper pair transistor (CPT) system, where an applied dc bias causes {{the system to}} self-oscillate via the ac Josephson effect. Varying the dc bias allows the self-oscillation frequency to be tuned. An unusual feature of the system design is that the dc bias does not significantly affect the high quality factor of the cavity mode to which the CPT predominantly couples. The CPT-cavity mode system has a mechanical analogue involving a driven coupled pendulum-oscillator system. The corresponding, nonlinear classical dynamical equations exhibit chaotic, as well as aperiodic motions depending on the initial conditions and the nature and strengths of the damping/noise forces. The quantum master equation exhibits such phenomena as dynamical tunneling and the generation of non-classical states from initial classical states.
