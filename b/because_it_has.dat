5|$|Bees can be {{severely}} and even fatally affected by pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals that man has {{introduced into the}} environment. They can appear inebriated and dizzy, and even die. This is serious <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> substantial economic consequences for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock has {{sometimes}} been labelled cock rock for its emphasis on overt masculinity and sexuality and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> historically been predominantly performed and consumed by men: {{in the case of}} its audience, particularly white, working-class adolescents.|$|E

5|$|Lastly, Asch {{suggested}} that group influence can change how people perceive stimuli (See Asch, 1940 for an example). This {{is the most}} obscure of Asch's major ideas, in large part <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> not been cited frequently (Levine, 1999), but is none-the-less important because it speaks {{to the power of}} group influence.|$|E
5|$|Metis lies inside Jupiter's {{synchronous}} orbit radius (as does Adrastea), {{and as a}} result, tidal forces slowly cause its orbit to decay. If its density is similar to Amalthea's, Metis's orbit lies within the fluid Roche limit; however, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> not broken up, it must lie outside its rigid Roche limit.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{speculate}} that Davidson Seamount {{is an ideal}} habitat for deep-sea corals and sponges <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> favorable bottom rock (bare lava rock), a steady food supply (supplied by a water current favoring the seamount; see the section above), {{and has not been}} disturbed by strong bottom currents than often bother other seafloor areas.|$|E

5|$|While Carabane's tourism {{sector has}} {{suffered}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> not {{taken part in}} the network of villages, tourists have avoided travelling to Casamance in general because of the civil unrest.

5|$|Women with {{endometrial cancer}} {{should not have}} routine {{surveillance}} imaging to monitor the cancer unless new symptoms appear or tumor markers begin rising. Imaging without these indications is discouraged because {{it is unlikely to}} detect a recurrence or improve survival, and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> its own costs and side effects. If a recurrence is suspected, PET/CT scanning is recommended.|$|E
5|$|Although Georgia has no {{significant}} oil or gas reserves, its territory hosts {{part of the}} Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline supplying Europe. Russia, Iran and the Persian Gulf countries were against {{the construction of the}} pipeline. The pipeline circumvents both Russia and Iran. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> decreased Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil, the pipeline has been {{a major factor in the}} United States' support for Georgia.|$|E
25|$|Nessov {{argued that}} Turanoceratops was a ceratopsid <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> horns and teeth with two roots.|$|R
25|$|Both {{publications}} {{are silent}} on Birca's size, layout and appearance. Based on Rimbert's account, Birca was significant <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a port {{and it was}} the place for the regional ting. Adam only mentions the port, but otherwise Birca seems to have been significant to him <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been the bridgehead of Ansgar's Christian mission and because archbishop Unni had been buried there.|$|R

5|$|Another early {{example is}} the 1981 Atari 2600 game Haunted House. Gameplay is typical of future {{survival}} horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence. The game uses monsters commonly featured in horror fiction, such as bats and ghosts, {{each of which has}} unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management, along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate item is found. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> several features that have been seen in later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as the first in the genre.|$|E
5|$|Built {{from its}} {{earliest}} nucleus outward, and having escaped {{much of the}} destruction endured by Poland during the 20th-century wars, Kraków's many architectural monuments can typically be seen in historical order by walking from the city centre out, towards its later districts. Kraków {{is one of the}} few medieval towns in Poland that does not have a historic Ratusz town hall in its Main Square, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> not survived the Partitions of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Children, ages 11–17, {{volunteer}} to become altar servers {{not only to}} serve the church but also <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> always been looked upon as an honor. It {{is a chance for}} children to serve their priest and become closer to Jesus by being on the altar. In addition, it is an opportunity for them to try to make themselves more holy and therefore more worthy of the position.|$|E

50|$|L' Hebdo ceased {{publication}} on 2 February 2017, at a readership of 155,000, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> become unprofitable.|$|R
5|$|Chlorine is {{responsible}} for the degradation of fish and shrimp in the creek. The sources for chlorine in urban runoff include irrigation and car washing. The only remaining fish species in the creek is carp, which can withstand high amounts of chlorine. Carp up to 18inches (1.5feet / 45cm) long have been found in Aliso Creek near the mouth. Temperatures of the creek near the mouth have been known to exceed , although the temperature at the outflow is often much colder <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been mixed with seawater.|$|E
5|$|DMSO {{is widely}} used as an {{alternative}} to water <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a lower dielectric constant than water, and is less polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable pKa range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some pKa values at 25°C for acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.|$|E
5|$|David C. Parker in 2004 {{argued that}} {{manuscript}} was written later the 6th century, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{a small number}} of square letters, and the handwriting is not typical for the 6th century. Some letters were compressed (Μ, Δ, Ε), the bar over the letter Τ is short and the letter Υ is written in several ways. According to Parker the manuscript should be dated to the 7th century.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{there were}} also a pairs' event but <b>it</b> was {{cancelled}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> only two entries, both Russian.|$|R
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> low rainfall, Aruba was not {{considered}} profitable for the plantation system and {{the economics of the}} slave trade.|$|R
50|$|The casket survived all the {{confiscations}} {{after the}} collapses of the Polish national uprisings, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> {{been moved to}} Kraków.|$|R
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{a target}} for planet finding {{programs}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> properties that allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder, it was a target star for NASA's proposed Space Interferometry Mission to search for Earth-sized planets. The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an interstellar probe {{can be sent to}} Epsilon Eridani.|$|E
5|$|George placed B.epica in B.subg. Banksia, {{because its}} inflorescences are typical Banksia flower spikes; B.sect. Banksia {{because of its}} {{straight}} styles; and B.ser. Cyrtostylis <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> slender flowers. He considered its closest relatives to be B.praemorsa (cut-leaf banksia) and B.media, {{both of which have}} shorter flowers and smaller pollen-presenters than B.epica. In addition, B.praemorsa differs in having a hairless perianth, and B.media has larger, more undulate leaves.|$|E
5|$|George placed B.telmatiaea in {{subgenus}} Banksia {{because its}} inflorescence {{is a typical}} Banksia flower spike, section Oncostylis <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> hooked styles, and series Abietinae because its inflorescence is roughly spherical. He considered its closest relative to be B.leptophylla (Slender-leaved Banksia), which differs from B.telmatiaea in having longer leaves and larger flowers; yet in his arrangement he placed it between B.scabrella (Burma Road Banksia) and B.laricina (Rose-fruited Banksia).|$|E
50|$|In October 2013, the EDL founder Tommy Robinson {{announced}} that he was leaving the organisation <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> become too extreme.|$|R
