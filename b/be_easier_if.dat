A new WRC rule for 2007 allowed for Remote Service Zones to be set up away from the main Service Park at Rally HQ. For 15 minutes the cars could be refuelled, re-tyred, and have any necessary maintenance carried out, as long as the parts and tools to do so (except fuel and tyres) were already in the vehicle. For Grönholm this was a major relief. On the previous stage his car had developed an issue with the hydraulic flappy-paddle gearchanges on his steering wheel, which meant he had had to resort to shifting gears manually. The technicians were unsure why or how it had occurred and were hoping that their repairs would last until the car got back to Valence. Loeb won an uneventful , but only by one-tenth of a second ahead of Sordo, and on [...] Sordo was quicker than Loeb, after Loeb stalled on the start-line and was unable to make up the lost seconds. At the midday break, Loeb was lamenting his lead over Sordo. [...] "Now it's a big battle between the two C4s. The other cars for the moment are behind, so it's good news for the team.

[...] Equalization basins {{may be used}} for temporary storage of diurnal or wet-weather flow peaks. [...] Basins provide a place to temporarily hold incoming sewage during plant maintenance and a means of diluting and distributing batch discharges of toxic or high-strength waste which might otherwise inhibit biological secondary treatment (including portable toilet waste, vehicle holding tanks, and septic tank pumpers).

40|$|We propose two {{principles}} that facilitate integration of two relational premises in spatial reasoning.

Moreover, integration <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>if,</b> in P 2, the anaphor is mentioned before the new element (given-new). In premises with canonical word order (grammatical subjects mentioned first), these principles always conflict with one another. In topicalized statements mentioning the prepositional phrase first, the two principles work in tandem. By varying word order, we tested the two principles by measuring P 2 comprehension times. Comprehension times indicated that integration <b>was</b> <b>easiest</b> when P 2 obeyed both principles and most difficult when both principles were violated. Canonical premises were of intermediate difficulty. This pattern emerged regardless of whether the anaphor was a definite description or a pronoun...|$|R
