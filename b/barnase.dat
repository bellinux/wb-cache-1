This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state.

The phases were assigned from their rate laws, sensitivity to mutations, and correspondence to regain of catalytic activity. At high ratios of denatured <b>barnase</b> to GroEL, 4 mol of <b>barnase</b> rapidly bind per 14 -mer of GroEL. At high ratios of GroEL to <b>barnase,</b> 1 mol of <b>barnase</b> binds with a rate constant of 3. 5 x 10 (7) s- 1. M- 1.

In this report, we describe the isolation of suppressor mutations in barstar that compensate for the loss in interaction energy caused by a mutation in <b>barnase.</b> Our suppressor search is based on in vivo selection for barstar variants that are able to protect host cells against the RNAse activity of those <b>barnase</b> mutants not properly inhibited by wild-type barstar. This approach utilizes a plasmid system in which <b>barnase</b> expression is tightly controlled to keep the mutant <b>barnase</b> gene silent. When expression of <b>barnase</b> is turned on, failure to form a complex between the mutant <b>barnase</b> and barstar has a lethal effect on host cells unless overcome by substitution of the wild-type barstar by a functional suppressor derivative. A set of barstar suppressors has been identified for <b>barnase</b> mutants with substitutions in two amino acid positions (residues 102 and 59), which are critically involved in both RNase activity and barstar binding.

The heat denaturation of <b>barnase</b> proceeds with a significant increase of heat capacity, which determines the temperature dependencies of the enthalpy and entropy of its denaturation. The partial specific heat capacity of denatured <b>barnase</b> is very close to that expected for the completely unfolded protein.

Therefore, the calorimetrically determined thermodynamic characteristics of <b>barnase</b> denaturation can be considered as characteristics of its complete unfolding and can be correlated with structural features [...] the number of hydrogen bonds, extent of van der Waals contacts, and the surface areas of polar and nonpolar groups. Using this information and thermodynamic information on transfer of protein groups into water, the contribution of various factors to the stabilization of the native structure of <b>barnase</b> has been estimated. The main contributors to the stabilization of the native state of <b>barnase</b> appear to be intramolecular hydrogen bonds.
