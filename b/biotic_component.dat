40|$|The {{classical}} {{environmental control}} model assumes that species diversity is primarily determined by environmental conditions (e. g., microclimate and soil) {{on the local}} scale. This assumption has been challenged by the neutral theory that assumes that the maintenance of biodiversity mainly depends on the ecological drift and dispersal limitation. Understanding the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity depends on decomposing the variation of species diversity into the contributions from the various components that affect it. We investigated and partitioned {{the effects of the}} <b>biotic</b> <b>component</b> (productivity, forest spatial structure) and the environmental component (topography and soil fertility) on the distribution of tree species richness jointly (the combined effect of environment and biotic process) and separately (the effect of environment or biotic process alone) in 25 permanent plots of 600 m 2 in a subtropical evergreen broadleaf secondary forest in southern China. The analysis was also completed for trees at different growth stages based on diameter breast height (young trees: 5 cm ≤ DBH 20 cm) within each plot. Our results indicated that (1) tree species richness had significant negative relationship with productivity and a unimodal relationship with its spatially structured distribution; (2) biotic and environmental factors both have significant influence on species richness and jointly explain ~ 60 % of the variation for the overall tree assemblage, and the variation explained by the two components jointly increased across growth stages (34 %, 44 %, and 75 %, respectively); (3) additive variation partitioning revealed that the tree species richness was dominantly controlled by environmental factors (32 %), while the <b>biotic</b> <b>component</b> also independently contributed a non-negligible effect (16 %); and (4) the dominant fraction changed from the <b>biotic</b> <b>component</b> to the environmental component across growth stages. Results suggest that the tree species richness may be governed from neutral process to environmental control during tree life span in subtropical evergreen broadleaf secondary forests...|$|E

40|$|The plant-soil {{feedback}} {{affects the}} forming {{of a plant}} community. Plants affect their own species {{as well as other}} species. The plant-soil feedback can be both positive and negative. Plants affect soil, change its properties, and the soil affects the plants reciprocally. Soil components can be divided into biotic and abiotic ones. The abiotic component is represented by physical and chemical properties of the soil. The main properties are the soil structure, the soil moisture, the soil temperature, the soil pH and the amount and availability of nutrients. The <b>biotic</b> <b>component</b> is composed of soil biota. The individual organisms can function as decomposers, symbionts and pathogens. The majority of soil organisms is composed of microorganisms, the most important of which are fungi and bacteria. The effect of the abiotic component in plant-soil feedback is mostly nonspecific, while the effect of the <b>biotic</b> <b>component</b> is more specific. These components interact with each other and determine the resulting effect on the plants and the type and intensity of interaction between various plant species. The aim of this thesis is to show the importance of these components in the plant-soil feedback.

40|$|Ecology {{has been}} defined in multiple, {{contrasting}} ways.

40|$|The present {{research}} was undertaken at three sampling stations of Gomti catchment, Central Gujarat, India, to study dominance, interaction, and interdependence among <b>biotic</b> <b>components</b> (phytoplankton, zooplankton and aquatic macrophytes). The phytoplankton population {{was represented by}} 39 genera and 48 species belongs to family Bacillariophyceae (21 species), followed by Cyanophyceae (7), Cholorophyceae (18), and Euglenophyceae (2). In total, seven classes of zooplankton were represented by 36 genera and 39 species. Zooplankton dominance was reflected by class Ciliophora (16 species), followed by Zooflagellata, Rhizopoda and Rotifera (6 each), and Cladocera (3),and least by Copepoda and Ostracoda (1 species each). Of 16 species of aquatic macrophytes, 3 (18. 75 %) were abundant, 4 (25 %) common, and 9 (56. 25 %) were rare. The indices (Palmer, Nygaard’s, and Macrophyte index) were determined to delineate the interdependent relationship among studied <b>biotic</b> <b>components.</b> Strong association was observed between Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae, Ostracods and Ciliophorans, and Cladocerans and Bacillariophyceans.

However, insecticides still remain as the preferred components of IPM in many crops. Hence it is essential to assess their safety to natural enemies before recommending them.

Thousands of nesting white ibis (Eudocimus albus) that foraged over a 20 -km radius fertilized a rookery with guano within Okefenokee Swamp. Georgia. USA. One to two yr after the birds abandoned it. this marsh showed continued enrichment effects. Elevated available phosphorus in sediments, as measured by equilibrium phosphate concentration, contributed to enhanced biomass of phytoplankton in the overlying water column. Planktivorous fish were greater in biomass than at reference sites. Experimental phosphorus and nitrogen fertilization of enclosures at a reference site (at levels representing residual enrichment after birds had left) caused zooplankton biomass to increase significantly. These results demonstrate that this blackwater ecosystem was macronutrient limited, and manifested residual enrichment effects of wading birds on sediments, and a positive effect of sediments on phytoplankton. Results also suggest further indirect positive effects of birds on higher trophic levels (zooplankton and fish), via macronutrient transfers...|$|E

We examined habitat uses by different size classes of the Formosan salmon and the sympatric shovelmouth minnow Varicorhinus barbatulus, and identified the relative importance of environmental variables, <b>biotic</b> <b>components</b> and seasonal effects in explaining the variance in the relative occurrences of fish at the catchment scale. After removing seasonal effects, 74. 9 % of the variation in the relative occurrence of fish was explained by the measured environmental variables and <b>biotic</b> <b>components.</b> Habitat uses by the Formosan salmon and shovelmouth minnow were distinct. The shovelmouth minnow occurred more frequently at sites with a high concentration of NH(3) -N and high proportions of gravel and riffles, while the Formosan salmon utilized sites at high elevations. Habitat uses by Formosan salmon of different size classes varied slightly. Juvenile and subadult salmon inhabited sites with lower temperatures and current velocities, but adult salmon occurred more frequently with large-grain-sized substratum.
