5|$|Alfred Hitchcock made a low-budget biographical film of Strauss in 1933 called Waltzes from Vienna. After {{a trip to}} Vienna, Walt Disney was {{inspired}} to create four feature films. One of those was The Waltz King, a loosely adapted biopic of Johann Strauss, which aired {{as part of the}} Wonderful World of Disney in the U.S. in 1963. In Mikhail Bulgakov's 1940 (published 1967) novel, The Master and Margarita, Johann Strauss conducts the orchestra during Satan's Great <b>Ball</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> invitation of Behemoth.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars undergo ecdysis {{and have}} a number of larval instars, usually five but varying between species. The new cuticle is soft and allows the {{increase}} in size and development of the caterpillar before becoming hard and inelastic. In the last ecdysis, the old cuticle splits and curls up into a small <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> posterior end of the pupa and is known as the larval exuvia.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Nevada in {{possession}} of the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Maryland 20-yard line.

5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Georgia Tech facing first down, in {{possession}} of the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Clemson 18-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Dwyer gained 10 yards and a first down with a running play to the Clemson eight-yard line. Three plays later, Dwyer completed the Yellow Jackets' scoring drive with a run into the end zone. The touchdown and extra point gave Georgia Tech its first lead of the game, 10–7, with 13:30 remaining.|$|E
5|$|After under-performing {{during the}} group stage, Baggio refound his {{form in the}} {{knockout}} stages, where he scored five memorable goals. He scored two in the round of 16, helping a ten-man Italy defeat Nigeria 2–1 at Foxboro Stadium in Boston, after trailing {{for most of the}} match. He scored his first goal of the match with two minutes left on the clock, after receiving <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> edge of the area from Roberto Mussi. He then went on to score the winning goal from a penalty in extra time after setting up Antonio Benarrivo with a lobbed pass, who was then fouled in the penalty area.|$|E
5|$|Because California {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> goal line and returned it 40yards. Bryan Randall {{got off to a}} good start, completing two passes for 26yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16yards. After pushing inside the California red zone, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick was no good.|$|E

5|$|Following the Florida State kickoff, Virginia Tech {{attempted}} to answer Florida State's kick-return touchdown {{with one of}} its own. Kendrick fielded the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech goal line and returned it 63 yards, {{all the way to}} the Florida State 37-yard line, where the Hokie offense began work. Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a first down. Tech kicker Shayne Graham was sent into the game, seemingly to attempt a 51-yard field goal. Instead of kicking the ball, Graham {{attempted to}} run the ball for a first down. Graham fumbled short of the first down, and Florida State took over on offense with 9:43 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|However, the Crimson Tide {{were unable}} to {{capitalize}} on the drive that ensued after Kenyan Drake fumbled the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> goal line and was recovered by the Vols' Cameron Sutton. Looking to score before halftime, Tennessee drove from their one-yard line to the Alabama 24 before Worley threw his second interception of the game. This time Landon Collins made the play at the 11-yard line and returned it 89-yards for a touchdown and a 35–0 halftime lead. Tennessee opened the second half with their first points on a 37-yard Michael Palardy field goal that made the score 35–3. The Crimson Tide responded later in the third with Yeldon's third one-yard touchdown run of the game and extended their lead to 42–3.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, most cricketers {{considered}} it unsportsmanlike to bowl the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> leg stump or for batsmen to {{hit on the}} leg side. But by {{the early years of}} the 20th century, some bowlers—usually slow or medium-paced—used leg theory as a tactic; the ball was aimed outside the line of leg stump and the fielders placed on that side of the field, the object being to test the batsman's patience and force a rash stroke. Two English left-arm bowlers, George Hirst in 1903—04 and Frank Foster in 1911—12, bowled leg theory to packed leg side fields in Test matches in Australia; Warwick Armstrong used it regularly for Australia. In the years immediately before the First World War, several bowlers used leg theory in county cricket.|$|E

5|$|In {{their first}} game of week ten, the Pros played against the Canton {{for the second time}} this season, and the Bulldogs were still upset from their loss earlier in the season against the Pros. A fumbled punt by the Bulldogs gave the Pros the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 32-yard line. On their next drive, the Pros' passing game gave them the lone score, a passing {{touchdown}} from King to Nash in the first quarter. Once again, the Pros shutout the Bulldogs, winning 7–0. This was the first game played on Thanksgiving Day, which launched a yearly tradition.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon III, {{since the}} Crimean War Britain's closest ally, visited London in April 1855, and from 17 to 28 August {{the same year}} Victoria and Albert {{returned}} the visit. Napoleon III met the couple at Boulogne and accompanied them to Paris. They visited the Exposition Universelle (a successor to Albert's 1851 brainchild the Great Exhibition) and Napoleon I's tomb at Les Invalides (to which his remains had only been returned in 1840), and were guests of honour at a 1,200-guest <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Palace of Versailles.|$|E
5|$|Nebraska {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the game but Maurice Purify fumbled on the first play from scrimmage. Oklahoma recovered the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Nebraska 2-yard-line and scored a touchdown {{to take the lead}} 70 with 48seconds expired off the clock. It was the fastest score in Big12 Championship Game history. With 5:35 left in the first quarter, Oklahoma's quarterback completed a touchdown pass to Malcolm Kelly to go up 140. With 4:37 left in the first half, Nebraska's Zach Taylor threw a touchdown pass and the extra point shaved Oklahoma's lead to 147, which was still the score as the game went to half-time.|$|E

5|$|Tech {{received}} Florida State's kickoff at {{its goal}} line {{and returned the}} ball to the 11-yard line, where Tech's offense took over. Kendrick ran for 12yards and a first down, but then Vick fumbled on a rush to the left. Florida State recovered the ball, and the Seminoles' offense was given the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech 35-yard line. On the first play after the fumble, Chaney broke free for a long run that gave State a first down inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. The Seminoles were pushed backward on two consecutive plays and committed a chop block before Bowden was forced to send in Janikowski to kick a 32-yard field goal. The kick gave Florida State a 3929 lead with 10:26 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 Gator Bowl {{kicked off}} on January 1, 2001 at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. Early on, Virginia Tech took {{advantage}} of Clemson mistakes to build a first-quarter lead.
