500|$|The episode {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Andy Meisler, {{in his book}} I Want to Believe: The Official Guide to the X-Files Volume 3, called the episode [...] "one of the best non-mythological episodes of the fourth season" [...] due to its [...] "seamless integration of character development, social commentary and the supernatural." [...] Juliette Harrisson of Den of Geek named [...] "Kaddish" [...] the best stand-alone episode of season four and called its conceit [...] "absolutely real and utterly tragic" [...] despite being [...] "highly fantastical". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club rated the episode [...] "B+", claiming that, while it was [...] "the sort of episode that works <b>best</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> enjoy it for its style and presentation without getting too {{caught up in the}} script", it felt [...] "appropriate". Handlen did, however, criticize the episode's characterization of Scully, noting that her scientific counter-arguments were [...] "becoming less about applying common sense to madness, and more just arguing for arguing's sake." ...|$|E
500|$|The Allied fleet {{sailed to}} Salamis, {{off the coast}} of Attica, to assist with the {{evacuation}} of the remaining Athenians. En route, Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the Ionian Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause:"Men of Ionia, that what you are doing is not proper, campaigning against your fathers and wishing to enslave Greece. It would be <b>best</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> came on our side. But if this is not possible, at least during the battle stand aside and also beg the Carians to do the same with you. But if you can not do either the one or the other, if you are chained by higher force and you can not defect during the operations, when we come at hand, act purposely as cowards remembering that we are of the same blood and that the first cause of animosity with the barbarians came from you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Navy's best {{test pilot}}, Captain Eric Brown, chief naval test pilot and {{commanding}} officer of the Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight Royal Aircraft Establishment, who tested the Me 262 noted: [...] "This was a Blitzkrieg aircraft. You whack in at your bomber. It {{was never meant to}} be a dogfighter, {{it was meant to be}} a destroyer of bombers... The great problem with it was it did not have dive brakes. For example, if you want to fight and destroy a B-17, you come in on a dive. The 30mm cannon were not so accurate beyond 600 metres. So you normally came in at 600 yards and would open fire on your B-17. And your closing speed was still high and since you had to break away at 200 meters to avoid a collision, you only had two seconds firing time. Now, in two seconds, you can't sight. You can fire randomly and hope for the <b>best.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want to sight and fire, you need to double that time to four seconds. And with dive brakes, you could have done that." ...|$|E
