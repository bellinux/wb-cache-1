Basin F had a maximum capacity of [...] and covered approximately 93 acre. Throughout the operation of Basin F, the saline concentration increased as water evaporated. The liquid formerly stored in Basin F is very salty water that contains some metals, hydrazine, wastewater, and toxic organics, which are only about 1 percent of the liquid.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} air blowing on paving grade vacuum residue to produce high {{softening}} point industrial grade asphalt {{have been studied}} in a gas-liquid reactor. Factors such as reactor design, temperature, air flow rate and time were investigated. Response of different feedstock sot metallic chloride catalysts were examined. The course of reaction was followed by measuring penetration and softening point of the blown product at regular intervals. It {{was found that the}} catalytic activity of metallic chloride could be enhanced by combining the chloride with manganese dioxide. Quantity of chloride catalyst, the amount of blown distillate and acidic gases are considerably reduced, by the addition of manganese dioxide for a given degree of hardness of the blown product. Chemical changes occurring during asphalt air blowing has been evaluated by adsorption-adsorption chromatography. The amount of asphaltene increases at the expense of saturate, namphthene aromatic and polar aromatic. Identical fractional chemical composition of different asphalts results in identical penetration and softening point. However, high molecular weight hydrocarbons may also be connected with hardening of asphalt. N. m. r. studies show transformation of straight chain hydrocarbons to cyloparaffins which in turn, are dehydrogenated to form aromatic hydrocarbons during air blowing. Dehydrogenation of asphalt molecules is supported by elemental analysed. U. v spectra show the formation of polycondensed aromatic, while f. t. i. r. spectra indicate incorporation of oxygen and cross linking in <b>blown</b> <b>asphalt.</b> Structural characterization of asphalt by instrumental methods, suggest that the blown product becomes more complex and condensed leading to increase in molecular weight. These changes are accelerated by active catalysts. The air blowing induces a movement of components from non-polar to more polar fractions. A general transformation mechanism has been proposed. Quantity and characteristics of the effluents {{have been found to be}} dependent on the chemical nature and physical properties of feed as well as on the catalyst used...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) {{suggested}} new performance based {{specifications for}} asphalt binders known as Performance Grade (PG) Specifications which suggest performing tests {{at the service}} temperature rather than a set temperature. To meet these new PG-specifications, manufacturers either altered manufacturing practices like air <b>blown</b> <b>asphalt,</b> or added modifiers like polymers. In general, the addition of modifiers improved the performance of hot mix asphalt concrete (HMAC), while the air blown or acid modified asphalt decreased the durability of the mixes. ^ In general, the new performance tests are unable to differentiate between polymer modified asphalts and acid modified asphalt. To overcome this problem, the elastic recovery test has been specified by the highway agencies because it can differentiate between asphalt binder consisting of modifier and acid modified asphalt binders. However, the discussions with the asphalt producers identified that the asphalt modified with Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR) does not pass elastic recovery test but performs well in the field. In addition, the test does not provide any fundamental property of asphalt binder. ^ Recently, a new test called repeated creep test has been proposed by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to measure the fundamental properties of asphalt binders {{and can be used}} to identify the presence of modifiers. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the capability of the repeated creep test in identifying the presence of modifiers. ^ Typically, rutting is one of the major causes of premature failure of HMAC, especially within the state of Texas. To identify rutting potential of hot mix asphalt concrete, the Hamburg Wheel Tracking Device (HWTD) test has been specified by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). If HWTD test results identify a mix to be rut susceptible, the test results do not necessarily indicate whether the mix design and/or asphalt binder is the major factor responsible for rutting potential. It may be possible that the repeated creep test results can identify the rutting potential; thus, identifying whether the asphalt binder is the contributing factor or not. Therefore, another objective of this study was to identify rutting potential of a mix consisting of rut prone asphalt binder using repeated creep tests. If a correlation can be established between the properties of the asphalt binders used in the HMAC and the rutting potential displayed in laboratory testing, the premature failure can be minimized. ^ To perform this study two mix designs used by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), Type-D and Coarse Matrix High Binder (CMHB-C), were selected. The Type-D mix was obtained from the Austin District and the CMHB-C from the Bryan District. Both of the chosen mixes have shown success in the field and have recently been placed using modifiers. The modifiers assessed in this study include, Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS), Styrene-Butadiene-Rubber 9 SBR), Tire Rubber (TR), and Elvaloy. Since the mix types are rut resistant and mix design are the same, the major factor contributing towards rutting of HMAC can be traced to the asphalt binders which is the only component that is altered between the mixes. To validate test results, two additional mixes (CMHB-C and Superpave from El Paso District) consisting of one binder type were evaluated. ^ The test results suggested that the presence of modifiers can be identified using repeated creep tests and can be used to identify the rutting potential of HMAC. In addition, a relationship between mix types and accumulated strains (from repeated creep tests) has been proposed. The developed relationships were further evaluated using different mix designs not evaluated in the original study. The test results suggest that repeated creep test results have the potential of being used as the test to identify rutting potential of HMAC. ...|$|E

Five different types of asphalt mixes were produced in the laboratory according to the Australian Standard methods of sampling and testing asphalt to modify payment performance mixture. The main role of this research is to evaluate and assess the hot-mix asphalt pavement performance characteristic for Western Australia road.

The aim {{of this research is}} to know characteristic of asphalt concrete mixture of type III which using charcoal dust of coconut shell with vary number of blow.
