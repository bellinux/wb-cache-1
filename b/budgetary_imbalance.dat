40|$|International audienceA 2 -box {{model has}} been used {{to assess the impact of}} both long- and {{short-term}} <b>budgetary</b> <b>imbalance</b> in the silica cycle on the average silicon isotopic composition (y 30 Si) of the ocean and marine sediments. Over a 100 -ky time span, such as a Quaternary glacial cycle, a sustained change in the riverine flux of silicon to the oceans could alter the average y 30 Si of seawater and the average y 30 Si of opal outputs by a few hundredths to a few tenths of permil. This would be largely tied to a change in the y 30 Si of silicon entering the ocean due to a shift in the proportion of riverine and non-riverine sources of silicon. A doubling of the riverine flux of silicon would have little impact on average marine y 30 Si, but a sustained halving of river inputs could interfere with use of y 30 Si as a tracer of nutrient utilization. Studies on the longer term focussed on the transition from a high silicic acid to low silicic acid ocean associated with the rise of the diatoms. This transition is marked by drop in the average y 30 Si of seawater from greater than + 1. 9 x down to about + 0. 8 x. The isotopic composition of diatom opal, however, has an isotopic composition that sticks close to the + 0. 8 x of the inputs and is thus unlikely to provide information about the transition to the low silicic acid ocean of the modern day. However, the y 30 Si of opal produced in the deep sea (for example, by sponges) should document this transition...|$|E
40|$|Sri Lanka's weak {{economic}} performance, although {{compounded by}} {{the civil war and}} <b>budgetary</b> <b>imbalance,</b> largely reflects the following: 1) a stop-and-go pattern of policy reform, because of political constraints - even though the results of reform were generally positive; 2) weak economic management, resulting in high inflation and a high fiscal and balance of payments deficit; 3) poor management of public spending; 4) mixed performance in exchange-rate management, with periods of substantial overvaluation; 5) financial policies that (despite recent improvements) hamper efficient financial intermediation; 6) prolonged trade protection, followed by selective trade liberalization; 7) continued distortion in agricultural policies; 8) inflexible labor markets and, despite Sri Lanka's outstanding track record on human development, problems with the quality of the labor force. To address a substantially unfinished policy agenda, Sri Lanka needs to intensify efforts to peacefully resolve civil conflict. There is also a need to squarely address its macroeconomic imbalances, involving a sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit, a cutback on public spending and redefinition of spending priorities, improvement of cost recovery for public services, and continuing to improve the management of the exchange rate. In trade policy, eliminate most quanitative restrictions, further reduce tariff protection, simplify the tariff structure, and, possibly, reform customs (to reduce leakage and abuse). Rationalize employment, exit, and bankruptcy regulations and procedures. The authors recommend improvement in communications between government and the private sector. It is necessary for the financial sector to become more competitive by legislating banking reform, giving state-owned banks more autonomy and putting private commercial banks on an equal footing with the two state banks, with the ultimate goal of privatizing the state banks, and also strengthen the supervision of banking. Also in the financial sector the authors have identified a need for privatization in insurance and pension funds to strengthen the capital market. Several aspects of the agricultural sector need to be revamped. Primarily, privatization of the estate plantations, perhaps through long-term management contracts and the gradual sale of share in assets; reduced trade protection; implementation of land reform; strengthen agricultural support; and possibly support rural financing institutions. Lastly, the authors suggest an end to government controls on hiring, firing, and wage setting as well as rationalization in civil service employment decisions.

40|$|From an {{economic}} perspective, imposing a credible one-off net wealth levy in crisis {{times as a}} tool to ward off a national emergency appears to be advantageous as, in an ideal world, this would not distort market players' allocation decisions. However, in practice, charging such a levy may give rise to distortions and unwanted effects on the real economy. Credibility that the levy will be imposed as a once-only measure is key to ensuring that harmful distortions in the allocation of resources are kept to a minimum. This paper confirms this using an analysis based on a DSGE model. In practice, while a government cannot guarantee that such a measure will be taken once only, it can contribute to the credibility thereof in a number of ways. First, the country's future 'business model' must become apparent; second, {{there has to be a}} basic level of confidence in the government and a firm belief that the <b>budgetary</b> <b>imbalances</b> were not actively caused by the state - at least not by the government currently in power; third, a verifiable outlook of sustainable public finances must be in place; and fourth, the political costs of a repeat levy must be high.

We thus examine the familiar so called twin deficit hypothesis. Our findings elucidate the existence of a short and long run relationship linking budgetary deficits to their current account counterparts. Thus a Granger causality test reveals that while budget deficits lead to one lag current account deficits, the latter in turn have arguably been the source of two lags deficits in the government budget, which gives a plausible testimony confirming the reverse hypothesis. Indeed, notwithstanding the strong causal effect whereby budget deficits resulted in four to nine year lagged current account deficits; a remarkably significant counter-effect exists, thus signifying a bi-directional causal relationship between the two types of deficits. The ECM analysis of our results indicates that a 10 percent increase in the government budget deficit will accentuate itself by a further 7 percent increase in the first lag but will also cause a one lag increase of 8. 7 percent in the current account deficit. These findings lend strong support to the twin deficit hypothesis in the Egyptian case. Barring the presence of strong shocks, it can plausibly be claimed that there is a reasonably stron...|$|R

In a comparative analysis among countries, the authors find there is no single model; rather, each country has a unique structure of institutions and norms that have important implications for the operation of its health system. Brazil shares some similarities with other countries that have adopted a decen-tralized system and is assuming features ever closer to U. S. federalism, with a complex web of relationships. The degree of inequality among Brazilian municipalities and states, along with the <b>budgetary</b> <b>imbalances</b> caused by the minimal levels of resource utilization, undermines Brazil’s constitutional principles and, consequently, its federalism. To ensure the constitutional mandate in Brazil, it is essential, as in other countries, to create a stable source of funds and increase the volume and efficiency of spending. Also important are investing in the training of managers, improving information systems, strengthening the principles of autonomy and interdependence, and defining patterns of cooperation within the federation. The themes of federalism, intergovernmental relations, and decentralization are of growing interest in Brazilian and international scientific writing. Studies on these topics generally deal with questions related to power distribution, in the name of freedom. This helps ensure greater autonomy for localities, establishing political rights and financial resources, as well as defining obligations to federal units, mostly through decentralization and resource transfers.

The challenges {{are for the most}} part related to the consequences of the economic crisis that began six years ago and the need to reduce <b>budgetary</b> and macroeconomic <b>imbalances.</b> The importance of this line of action in economic policy is further reflected in European Commission findings which point to the vulnerabilities of the Croatian economy and the consequential assessment of the possibility to introduce corrective measures that could ultimately result in the freezing of EU funds. Moreover, fiscal vulnerabilities have resulted in excessive deficit procedure being launched in January 2014, whereby Croatia was obliged, in accordance with Council recommendations, to reduce the deficit to 2. 7 % of GDP by the end of 2016 and ensure sustainable trajectory of public debt. On the other hand, a number of indicators point to favourable economic trends, notably high-frequency macroeconomic indicators including industrial production, the number of tourists’ overnight stays, real turnover in retail trade and construction works show an upward trend, while exports and employment rates are increasing. The forecasted GDP growth rate for 2016 will thus significantly exceed initial expectations. Over the medium term the positive trends are expected to continue, with a gradual increase in economic activity. In 2017 and 2018 GDP is projected to increase by 3. 2 %, this increase rising to 3. 3 % in 2019. It should be noted that projected general government deficit in 2016 will be significantly lower than initially forecasted. Moreover, the debt-to-GDP ratio is declining {{for the first time since}} 2007 and is projected to reach 83. 9 % at the end of 2016, which is almost 3 pp below the ratio registered at the end of 2015...|$|R
40|$|Cover pagesTextÂ AnnexesThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse {{budgetary}} policies carried out during and after severe recessions. Since the agreement on the "Stability and Growth Pact" by the European Council in Dublin in December 1996, interest in this issue has increased significantly. The Stability and Growth Pact, which sets the rules for budgetary behaviour in stage three of EMU, singles out severe recessions as specifically problematical periods during which a certain budgetary flexibility could be allowed. The rules laid out in the Stability and Growth Pact are used in this paper as a benchmark to evaluate past budgetary behaviour during recessions in the fifteen European Union Member States. More specifically, the paper provides elements to examine the following issues: what type of budgetary policies have been adopted during severe recessions in the past? Were the automatic stabilisers allowed to operate fully and did governments adopt an expansionary budgetary policy stance? Which factors influenced the policies undertaken and what was the composition of the measures adopted? Can the accumulation of debt, which took place in the past two decades in Europe, be explained by "tax smoothing" during periods of economic hardship?II/ 195 / 97 -ENConcluding remarks The application of the provisions of the Excessive Deficit Procedure and the Stability and Growth Pact to the past is obviously a highly speculative exercise. Its results do not address the following questions: to what extent is past budgetary behaviour a reliable guide to assess the likely behaviour of national budgetary policies in EMU during recessions? More specifically, would Member States need larger or smaller changes in their budgetary positions to provide the degree of stabilisation which occurred in the past?A number of factors will play an important role:New policy regime under EMUDuring the third phase of EMU, the conduct of monetary policy will be centralised at the European level and will therefore no longer be available as a policy tool at the national level. Budgetary policy will thus be the main macroeconomic policy instrument still available for individual Member States to combat recessions, especially when shocks are asymmetric. The impossibility of lowering interest rates and resorting to currency devaluations might require larger deficit changes. On the other hand, according to the Mundell-Fleming framework, budgetary policy will in principle become more effective in dampening the amplitude of cyclical fluctuations in the new policy environment of EMU with centralised monetary policy and irrevocably fixed exchange rates between Member States. If, however, EMU enhances the process of economic integration, trade leakages of budgetary policies will gradually increase, thereby reducing the "domestic" effectiveness of budgetary policies. Unless national policies are co-ordinated, this factor raises the changes in the budget deficit required in order to attain the same degree of stabilisation achieved in the past. "Pre-recession" deficit levelActual deficit changes observed during past recessions were applied in our retrospective exercise to "pre-recession" deficit levels chosen specifically for the exercise (0 % and 2 % of GDP). However, the actual deficit changes which took place during past severe recessions usually started from markedly higher pre-recession deficit levels. The impact on the economy of budgetary policy changes during recessions also varies depending on the deficit and debt levels. For instance, the markets' perception of an increase in the deficit from 0 % to 2 % of GDP during a severe recession will be different from that of a rise in the deficit from, say, 8 % to 10 % of GDP, the latter more likely being interpreted as shifting the deficit to an unsustainable path. This may lead to an increase in the risk premium on interest rates which reduces the effectiveness of the fiscal expansion. High <b>budgetary</b> <b>imbalances</b> may inhibit policy makers from using the budgetary instrument for stabilisation purposes. Indeed, the higher risk premiums which would raise the interest burden may represent a powerful disincentive to expanding fiscal policy in spite of the recession. As was pointed out in Section 4, budgetary reactions to economic downturns differ depending on the initial public finance conditions before the recession: countries with high deficit and debt levels tend to conduct tighter fiscal policies during recessions than those with lower deficit and debt levels. In the future, when medium-term targets have been achieved, Member States would have more room for manoeuvre to undertake accommodating policies. These factors point in different directions. As a consequence, the net effect on the requirement for budgetary stabilisation is ambiguous. If it proved necessary to reinforce the working of the automatic stabilisers during recessions in EMU, larger swings in budget deficits compared to the past would have to be allowed for. Under the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, this would imply, however, that during the third phase of EMU, Member States, and especially those with large automatic stabilisers, would have to run budgetary surpluses when in medium-term equilibrium. The present paper far from exhausts the issue of what can be learnt from the past budgetary behaviour for the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and, more generally, how budgetary authorities actually behaved in different economic circumstances. The following areas were not or were only partially covered, and therefore, provide scope for further research:Budgetary policies over the full cycle: this paper has focused essentially on recession episodes. The exercise could therefore be extended to other cyclical phases besides the recession. Indeed, as already indicated in this paper, the problem in the past has not been so much that Member States let budget deficits get out of hand too much during recessions but that they did not seize the opportunity presented by post-recession economic recovery to immediately correct their budgetary position. Composition of budgetary policies: the paper addressed the issue of the composition of budgetary policy reactions to recessions via a preliminary analysis of the overall revenue and expenditure components. Two extensions can be envisaged: first, an analysis of the composition of retrenchment policies over the years following the recession to assess, for instance, whether the length of the adjustment depends on the composition of budgetary consolidation; second, a further disaggregation of the overall components into more detailed government revenue and expenditure categories is necessary. This detailed analysis would allow conclusions to be drawn on the mechanisms causing budgetary policies to become unsustainable, as well as on the possible effectiveness and durability of budgetary consolidation efforts. recessions, modelling, fiscal policy, public finances...|$|R
40|$|Fiscal Responsibility Laws (FRLs) {{appear to}} be more popular in middle-income {{countries}} than advanced countries, even though their success is limited. The reasons why few advanced countries have a FRL include: the existing legal framework for the budget system is adequate; supranational rules and political agreements in EU countries; failed attempts to include quantitative fiscal rules in laws; lack of consensus or interest in attaining the goals of FRL-type legislation; and lack of need for a law to regulate fiscal transparency, accountability and macro-fiscal stabilization. Without commitment to fiscal discipline, adoption of a FRL may not contribute to attaining fiscal consolidation goals.
