5|$|Various {{stories have}} been told about Bregowine's origins, {{including}} {{that he was a}} nobleman and a continental Saxon who converted to Christianity and came to Canterbury because of the saintly reputation of Theodore of Tarsus. Others say that he owed his elevation to King Æthelbert II of Kent, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> stories rest on works that were written after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. There are no contemporary records of Bregowine before he was archbishop. It does not appear, however, that he was of Mercian origins like his predecessors Tatwin and Nothhelm.|$|E

25|$|Hippolytus supposes Valentinus to have derived {{his system}} {{from that of}} Simon; and in that as expounded in the Apophasis Megale, from which he gives extracts, the origin of things is derived from six roots, divided into three pairs; <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> roots spring from a single {{independent}} Principle, which is without consort. The name Sige occurs in the description which Hippolytus (vi. 18) quotes from the Apophasis, how from the supreme Principle there arise {{the male and female}} offshoots nous and epinoia. The name Sige is there given not to either of the offshoots but to the supreme Principle itself: however, in the description, these offshoots appear less as distinct entities than as different aspects of the same Being.|$|E

Previously, Umarov had been reported killed or captured by Russian forces on numerous occasions, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> reports later turned out to be incorrect. According to a report posted on Kavkaz Center, Umarov was poisoned on 6 August 2013 and died at dawn on 7 September 2013.

25|$|The {{circumstance}} of Mr. Rogers having preached at Paul's cross, after Queen Mary {{arrived at}} the Tower, has been already stated. He confirmed in his sermon the true doctrine taught in King Edward's time, and exhorted the people to beware of the pestilence of popery, idolatry, and superstition. For this he was called to account, but so ably defended himself that, for that time, he was dismissed. The proclamation of the queen, however, to prohibit true preaching, gave his enemies a new handle against him. Hence he was again summoned before the council, and commanded to keep to his house. He did so, though he might have escaped; and though he perceived {{the state of the}} true religion to be desperate. He knew he could not want a living in Germany; and he could not forget a wife and ten children, and to seek means to succor them. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things were insufficient to induce him to depart, and, when once called to answer in Christ's cause, he stoutly defended it, and hazarded his life for that purpose.|$|E
25|$|The {{permanent}} council {{established at the}} instance of the Russian government (1773–1788) served as the highest administrative tribunal, and occupied itself with the elaboration of {{a plan that would}} make practicable the reorganization of Poland on a more rational basis. The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous Komisja Edukacji Narodowej ("Commission of National Education"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One {{of the members of the}} commission, kanclerz Andrzej Zamoyski, along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some szlachta and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the French Revolution of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.|$|E

500|$|The opening chorus in F major is {{a setting}} of the short text [...] "." [...] (For this the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy {{the works of the}} Devil.) Klaus Hofmann notes: [...] "This work of {{destruction}} is portrayed in the chorus by repeated percussive notes and extended coloratura, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> illustrative elements are subordinated to a festive Christmas spirit". The horns open the ritornello with a short signal-like motif that is picked up by the oboes and the strings. The movement resembles a prelude and fugue, because the text is first presented in homophony to a repeat of the beginning of the ritornello, then repeated as a fugue, and finally repeated in madrigal style similar to the first section.|$|E
500|$|The early 1990s saw a {{few more}} LGBT minor {{characters}} portrayed in DC titles. Transsexual themes were explored in a 1992 storyline in Legion of Super-Heroes, in which Element Lad finds out that Shvaughn Erin, the woman he is in love with, is actually {{a man who has}} taken a sex-change drug to be with him; Element Lad subsequently reveals that he prefers Shvaughn as a male. A lesbian relationship was also implied between the Legion of Super-Heroes' Shrinking Violet and Lightning Lass, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> non-heterosexual characters were retconned during the Zero Hour [...] "reboot" [...] to be straight. Camelot 3000 also explored transsexual themes by having Sir Tristan reincarnated into the body of a woman, to his initial dismay. Notable storylines featuring LGBT themes include the 1991’s The Flash [...] (vol. 2) #53, which had received the first GLAAD Award for Best Comic Book in 1992. Here, the reformed villain Pied Piper was revealed as gay. Another is the coming out of Kyle Rayner's assistant and an arc about his [...] "gay bashing" [...] in Green Lantern, both written by Judd Winick. These stories earned the writer title two GLAAD awards and a Gaylactic Spectrum Awards (and a further nomination). Green Lantern also has a lesbian couple, Lee and Li, as supporting characters.|$|E
500|$|On September 28, 1842, after {{exhausting}} {{his final}} appeal, Colt {{was sentenced to}} death by hanging and remanded to New York City's infamous prison, the Tombs. His sentence was to be carried out on November 14, 1842. Colt asked that he be allowed to marry Caroline Henshaw on the morning of his hanging. While imprisoned, Colt lived luxuriously in his prison cell, receiving daily visits from friends and family, smoking Cuban cigars, sleeping in an actual bed instead of a mound of straw and wearing silk dressing gowns inside and a seal skin overcoat for his daily walks in the prison yard. [...] His cell contained the latest novels, a gilded bird cage with a canary and fresh flowers brought to him every day by Henshaw. [...] He dined on meals from local hotels such as quail on toast, game pates, reed birds, and ortolans. [...] Several attempts were made to break him out of the prison by dressing him in women's clothing <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> efforts were foiled. [...] A doctor was hired who claimed he could resuscitate Colt from the hanging, providing the body did not remain suspended long, as he believed Colt's neck to be of such thickness that strangulation would be impossible. [...] Colt's friends put the doctor up in the Shakespeare Hotel {{on the morning of the}} scheduled hanging and planned to bring the body there from the Tombs for resuscitation.|$|E
