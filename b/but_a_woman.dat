5|$|In 1873 New Mexico Territory, {{an unnamed}} loner (Daniel Craig) awakens {{injured in the}} desert with no memory and with a strange metal object on his wrist. He wanders into the town of Absolution, where preacher Meacham treats his wound. Sheriff Taggart recognizes the {{stranger}} as wanted outlaw Jake Lonergan and attempts to arrest him. Jake beats up the posse sent to take him in and nearly escapes, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> named Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) knocks him out. Taggart prepares to transport both Jake and volatile drunk Percy Dolarhyde to Santa Fe for trial.|$|E

He leaves behind a priestly antiquarian to examine the relics and determine which are genuine. A few hours later the priest emerges with a basket full of forged relics and the news that only the few which remain are genuine.|$|E
25|$|Both Chilean men {{and women}} qualify for a family {{allowance}} if they have dependent {{children under the age}} of eighteen (or twenty-four if in school). There are differences in entitlement requirements for the spouse-related family allowance since a man qualifies for a family allowance if he has a dependent wife, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> only qualifies for a family allowance if her husband is disabled. Until a reform of paternity laws in 1998, children born outside marriage had less right to parental financial support and inheritance than children born within marriage. A bill was passed in 2007 to give mothers direct access to child support payments.|$|E

500|$|Wadia {{admitted}} to feeling [...] "emotionally drained" [...] after her scenes with Ace Bhatti. She explained to The People: [...] "It's very draining. I'm putting myself into this very dark place which I know sadly {{is a reality}} for so many women. Zainab's confidence has been steadily eroded. She's feeling isolated and has fallen under Yusef's control. He wants revenge. She is totally in his power. I had to show this can happen to any woman, no matter how strong she seems. Zainab was strong and not naive, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> is vulnerable if the man hits the right psychological weak spots. But both Ace and I have {{found it hard to}} do. I've known Ace {{for a long time and}} we're good friends. He has been wonderful to work with on this and very concerned about me all the way through." [...] Wadia has been given advice on the storyline from the Roshni refuge in Birmingham, which specializes in abuse within Asian families.|$|E
500|$|By {{at least}} July 1999, Monolith {{has decided to}} {{introduce}} many major changes to the game; the main reason being that the gaming press unexpectedly started comparing the game to James Bond games, like GoldenEye 007 (1997). Hubbard mentioned that their intention was to [...] "make a 60s spy game", and that they [...] "didn't {{want to make a}} 'Bond' style game, so when people were obviously drawing that comparison, we decided to rework things a bit. We wanted {{to get away from the}} Bond comparisons that people were making, so we've changed the main character and the back-story a fair amount." [...] As a result, the player controls a female protagonist in the final game, Cate Archer, who works for an organization called UNITY. Changing the main character to a woman not only helped the separation of the game from the Bond franchise, but also allowed for [...] "more interesting dramatic possibilities", and the [...] "list of gadgets got a lot more visually interesting". As Hubbard said, before switching to a female protagonist, he had been [...] "struggling with trying to distinguish him from all the other male superspies from the era—extraordinarily handsome, intelligent, knowledgeable, resourceful, and so on. <b>But</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> with those same characteristics immediately stood out because of the social climate of the time. No matter how qualified she might be, she'd have to overcome some serious barriers just to get a chance to prove herself. And if things didn't go flawlessly on a mission, she'd catch more heat than she deserved." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two American poets also {{explored}} feminine {{psychology in}} poems ostensibly about the enchantress. Leigh Gordon Giltner's [...] "Circe" [...] {{was included in}} her collection The Path of Dreams (1900), the first stanza of which relates the usual story of men turned to swine by her spell. But then a second stanza presents a sensuous portrait of an unnamed woman, {{very much in the}} French vein; once more, it concludes, 'A Circe's spells transform men into swine'. This is no passive victim of male projections <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> conscious of her sexual power. So too is Hilda Doolittle’s “Circe”, from her collection Hymen (1921). In her soliloquy she reviews the conquests with which she has grown bored, then mourns the one instance when she failed. In not naming Ulysses himself, H.D. universalises an emotion with which all women might identify. At the end of the century, the British poet Carol Ann Duffy wrote a monologue entitled Circe which pictures the goddess addressing an audience of 'nereids and nymphs'. In this outspoken episode in the war between the sexes, Circe describes the various ways in which all parts of a pig could and should be cooked.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} written {{extensively}} on the place of women within the novel, even though it focuses on men. In part this is because Barker's previous novels focus on working class women's history. In her companion to the novel, Karin Westman sees the novel as a response by Barker to critics stereotyping her as only being interested in writing about women. However, Baker has repeatedly talked about how this novel as connected with her earlier interests in feminism. Barker describes the novel as providing a voice for the home front, stating, that [...] "In {{a lot of books}} about war by men the women are totally silenced. The men go off and fight and the women stay at home and cry; basically, this is the typical feature. And the women in the trilogy are always deeply significant, and whatever they say in whatever language they say it in, it is always meant to be listened to very carefully." [...] In particular, Barker is interested in the contradictions placed on women's expectations during war period, and its history; for example, she points out that the women in the munitions factories are expected to produce weapons to kill thousands, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who attempts to abort her unborn child is criticised.|$|E
2500|$|Ellen Burstyn {{was still}} in the midst of filming The Exorcist when Warner Bros. {{executives}} expressed interest in working with her on another project. Burstyn later recalled, [...] "It was early in the woman's movement, and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different… I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> that I recognized, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore… When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said 'Go look at a movie called Mean Streets and see what you think.' It hadn't been released yet, so I booked a screening to look at it and I felt that it was exactly what…Alice needed, because [...] was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know – in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day–Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty." ...|$|E
2500|$|As with nationality, The Mystery of the Sea often {{addresses}} gendered {{conceptions of}} identity, and presents an ambivalent {{view on the}} roles of women. David Glover asserts that Stoker's [...] "writings can certainly be placed within the antifeminist backlash of the [...] period", while Lisa Hopkins recognizes the tensions in Stoker's work regarding the New Woman and notes how Archibald Hunter must confront [...] "menacing and insubordinate females". Marjory, the female protagonist, is a crossing point between the ideal mid-nineteenth-century woman {{and the idea of}} the New Woman, which had taken shape {{at the end of the}} century. She is brave, independent, and defiant, as exemplified by her purchase of a warship, her evasion of the diplomats who try to protect her, and constant assertions that she has a fighting spirit. Mrs. Jack, her companion, represents more traditional views of womanhood, as shown when she lectures Marjory on her duties to her husband. Marjory eventually listens to Mrs. Jack's advice, and her somewhat exceptional behavior ultimately does not interfere with her [...] "feminine" [...] weaknesses. Marjory is deeply in love with her husband and ends the novel saying she will never leave his side. She occasionally betrays fear and even expresses longing for some of the more traditional feminine characteristics apparently typical of non-American women. Archibald loves her and is enamored with her fierce spirit, and admires her [...] "coolness of head" [...] but this does not stop him from noting that she possesses [...] "the little morsel of hysterics which goes to make up the sum total of every woman". Hopkins observes that Archibald feels that he ultimately has the advantage by being a man, and notes that gender is [...] "the one arena in which Stoker's men… can always win". Despite the apparent power of Marjory's [...] "new" [...] brand of femininity, it is ultimately flawed in Stoker's representations. The strongest example of this contradiction between the strength of the New Woman and more traditional feminine weakness is Archibald's assertion that [...] "my Marjory, though a strong and brave one, was <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> after all". Throughout The Mystery of the Sea, women are shown to be intelligent and generally more useful than passive; however, this does not stop the narrator from characterizing women as best suited to being subservient, pleasing companions to men.|$|E
