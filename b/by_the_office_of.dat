Upon the arrival of the authorities, Francisco Rafael's wife—in between tears—informed them of the former drug lord's identity. The autopsy revealed that Francisco Rafael died of severe traumatic brain injury from shots in the thorax and head with a FN Five-seven pistol. The murder of Francisco Rafael initially fell under state jurisdiction because he was not wanted by the federal government when he was killed. Therefore, the murder investigation was started by the Baja California Sur authorities and not <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> the General Prosecutor (PGR).
