5|$|Binondo, {{the oldest}} {{and one of the}} largest Chinatowns in the world, was the center of {{commerce}} and business activities in the city. Numerous residential and office skyscrapers are found within its medieval streets. Plans to make the Chinatown area into a business process outsourcing (BPO) hub progresses and is aggressively pursued by the city government of Manila. 30 buildings are already identified to <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> BPO offices. These buildings are mostly located along the Escolta Street of Binondo, which are all unoccupied and can <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> offices.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{school building}} in Fore Street {{was built in}} 1583 a private residence for William Symes of Poundisford. In 1671 his youngest son, John, conveyed the property to 12 trustees so that it should <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> a grammar school - according to his father's wish.|$|E

5|$|A {{regeneration}} {{scheme was}} announced in 2004; supported by the Phoenix Trust, the maltings would <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> residential, retail and business space. Public consultation took place in 2005 and 2006, with around 90% of participants supporting regeneration and three-quarters asking for a cinema and entertainment complex. Lincolnshire Enterprise granted £200,000 towards the regeneration scheme and the Gladedale Group came forward to develop the project. Over the next three years, they worked with the Prince's Regeneration Trust to draw up plans for the site's regeneration which protected the historic exterior. In 2009, their proposals were submitted for planning permission. North Kesteven District Council approved the £50million development in 2011; Tesco was also granted permission to build a £20million supermarket {{as part of the}} redevelopment. The maltings would <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> retail and office space, alongside 220 apartments.|$|E
5|$|Grameen's {{objective}} {{has been}} to promote financial independence among the poor. Yunus encourages all borrowers to become savers, so that their local capital can <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> new loans to others. Since 1995, Grameen has funded 90 percent of its loans with interest income and deposits collected, aligning the interests of its new borrowers and depositor-shareholders. Grameen converts deposits made in villages into loans for the more needy in the villages (Yunus and Jolis 1998).|$|E
5|$|Hillingdon Council {{provided}} a £150,000 grant in September 2010 {{for the restoration}} of the buildings. In April 2011, the council joined with the Friends to seek funding of up to £1million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, to support restoration work.

5|$|The Athlete's Village {{was located}} in the West Don Lands along Front Street between Bayview Avenue and Cherry Street.

5|$|The Playhouse theatre on Westgate was {{constructed}} in 1825, and sold in 1856 to <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> an infants school and later a library and offices. In 1994, Sleaford Little Theatre bought and restored it and in 2000 it opened to the public. The Sleaford Picturedrome opened in 1920; the cinema closed in 2000 and the building became a snooker hall and then a nightclub that closed in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Amino acids {{are either}} used to {{synthesize}} proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea {{and carbon dioxide}} {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase. The amino group is fed into the urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton {{in the form of a}} keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α-ketoglutarate. The glucogenic amino acids can also <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> glucose, through gluconeogenesis (discussed below).|$|E
5|$|Centre Point, {{just beyond}} {{the eastern end of}} Oxford Street next to Tottenham Court Road station, was {{designed}} by property developer Harry Hyams and opened in 1966. It failed to find a suitable tenant and sat empty for many years, eventually being occupied by squatters who used it as a centre of protest against the lack of suitable accommodation in Central London. In 2015, the building began to <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> residential flats, with development expected to finish in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron {{by means of a}} cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization. Cast iron and pig iron could <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> wrought iron and steel using a fining process.|$|E

5|$|However, {{instead of}} {{being used as a}} coastal defense ship, Deutschland was broken up in 1920–1922. Hannover was to <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> a target vessel, {{although}} this was never done. She was eventually broken up in 1944–1946. Schlesien and Schleswig-Holstein were the only two vessels of the class to see continued front-line service in the Reichsmarine and later the Kriegsmarine. Both ships saw limited duty during World War II, which was inaugurated by the firing of Schleswig-Holsteins main guns at the Polish fortress at Westerplatte. Near {{the end of the war}} the two ships were both sunk.|$|E
5|$|In {{carbohydrate}} anabolism, simple {{organic acids}} can <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> monosaccharides such as glucose and {{then used to}} assemble polysaccharides such as starch. The generation of glucose from compounds like pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, glycerate 3-phosphate and amino acids is called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate {{through a series of}} intermediates, many of which are shared with glycolysis. However, this pathway is not simply glycolysis run in reverse, as several steps are catalyzed by non-glycolytic enzymes. This is important as it allows the formation and breakdown of glucose to be regulated separately, and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously in a futile cycle.|$|E
5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is {{an early}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E
50|$|On June 21, 1957 the sitios of Dimabono, Laboy, Dinadiawan and Puangi <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> barrios. Several more sitios <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> barrios on June 18, 1966.|$|R

5|$|In the mid-1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{decided to}} build a class of two {{submarine}} tenders which could <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> light aircraft carriers or fleet oilers. The first ship, Tsurugizaki, was commissioned into service in 1939. Construction of the second, Takasaki, was stopped soon after launch and she was completed as an aircraft carrier. The ship was commissioned as Zuiho in December 1940. In early 1941, Tsurugizaki {{was taken out of}} service, converted to an aircraft carrier, and recommissioned as Shōhō in early 1942.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 1909, American-Hawaiian, looking to expand its fleet, placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for three new cargo ships—Kentuckian, Georgian, and Honolulan. The {{contract}} for the ships required that American-Hawaiian pay $1,000,000 in cash and a further $650,000 in twelve monthly notes at 5% interest. Provisions of the deal allowed that the monthly notes could <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> longer-term mortgages at 6% interest, and secured by the ships themselves. The final cost of Kentuckian, including financing costs, was $58.33 per deadweight ton, which came out to just under $579,000.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a double}} system, that is, {{the sound was}} on a {{different}} piece of film from the picture.... In essence, the sound was captured by a microphone and translated into light waves via a light valve, a thin ribbon of sensitive metal over a tiny slit.
