2500|$|In Arkansas, re-organization of the Arkansas State Guard {{actually}} began in 1901 under Governor Jeff Davis. Major General W.M. Maynes, in a <b>biennial</b> <b>report</b> dated 31 December 1906 provided {{an overview of}} the status of the Arkansas Militia. The Militia was subdivided by statute into the State Guard, or active organize militia, and the Reserve Militia. The State Guard, or regularly enlisted, organized and uniformed militia, was at a total strength of 1,274 personnel. The Federal Government appropriated $35,956.86 for the support of the Arkansas State Guard in that year and the Adjutant General applied to the General Assembly for appropriation of one half the Federal appropriation. Beginning {{with the passage of the}} [...] "Dick" [...] Act, the Arkansas State Guard was henceforth called the 'Arkansas National Guard'. The units retained their designations as the 1st Arkansas Infantry, 2nd Arkansas Infantry, etc., until the beginning of World War I, when all National Guard units were redesignated with federal numbers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first step}} to {{fighting}} the war for Stilwell was the reformation of the Chinese Army. These reforms clashed with the delicate balance of political and military alliances in China, which kept Chiang in power. Reforming the army meant removing men who maintained Chiang's position as commander-in-chief. While he gave Stilwell technical overall command of some Chinese troops, Chiang worried that the new American-led forces would become yet another independent force outside of his control. Since 1942, members of his staff had continually objected to Chinese troops being used in Burma for the purpose, as they viewed it, of returning that country to British colonial control. Chiang therefore sided with General Claire Chennault's proposals that {{the war against the}} Japanese be continued largely using existing Chinese forces supported by air forces, something Chennault assured the Generalissimo was feasible. The dilemma forced Chennault and Stilwell into competition for the valuable Lend-Lease supplies arriving over the Himalayas from British-controlled India — an obstacle referred to as [...] "The Hump". George Marshall, in his <b>biennial</b> <b>report</b> covering the period of July 1, 1943 to June 30, 1945, acknowledged he had given Stilwell [...] "one of the most difficult" [...] assignments of any theater commander.|$|E
