As types 3, 4 and 6 buildings, the 23 {{towers of}} Lam Tin Estate were shaped as cuboids and resembled candy-boxes {{standing on a}} knoll. Most buildings were 16-storeys high and housed about 800 units. Each building had an estimated capacity of 3,000 residents and an approximate space allocation at 30ft² per person. Bathrooms and kitchens were combined into one compartment, as were living rooms and bedrooms. Lifts only reached some of the floors. To access the other floors, one needed to exit the lift at a level nearby and hike upstairs or downstairs. On the ground floor beneath the buildings were a variety of shops which served the residents. Although densely packed, the living environment of Lam Tin Estate fostered close relationships in the neighbourhood.|$|E

25|$|Damage {{intensity}} {{varied from}} EF1 to EF2 in intensity as the tornado entered Wilcox County and passed {{near the town}} of Rochelle. Off Double Run Road and CR 41, a small farm building was completely destroyed. Two residences had their windows broken, and a metal <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> was severely damaged, with several anchored metal trusses ripped from the concrete foundation; this resulted in total collapse of the building. Additional metal barns and outbuildings nearby were severely damaged. Along Crawford Dairy Road, several large wooden electrical transmission towers were snapped. Farther northeast, a semi-truck trailer was flipped, flattened, and pushed across the road. Another metal <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> had its southeast corner completely destroyed, and it had a few 2ft (0.61m) deep concrete support beams ripped out of the ground. A small home sustained minor roof and siding damage, and several single to double-wide mobile homes were completely destroyed, with debris thrown up to 100yd (91m) downstream. Damage to some of the manufactured homes was consistent with a high-end EF2 tornado. The storm crossed Highway 280, destroying several small wooden sheds and fences, and downing numerous trees before finally lifting along Kingfisher Road west of Abbeville at 4:27p.m. EST (21:27UTC).|$|E

25|$|Besides {{the harbor}} and the beaches, there is another {{distinguishing}} feature of El Jebha: The Mosque. During the last decade El Jebha experienced an increasing population with a similar increase in size. This resulted in an overcrowded mosque, which could not hold this increasing number of people. For this reason a big new mosque {{was built in the}} tradition of Moroccan coastal places. This means that the color white prevails in both the exterior as the interior designs of the <b>building</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
25|$|Port Dock Brewery hotel won {{business}} awards as best {{hotel and}} restaurant in 2001. It {{was built in}} 1855 and opened as the Dock Hotel. The current <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> results from an 1883 rebuild, with stone from Dry Creek near Yatala Labour Prison. The Hotel lost its licence in 1909, after a 1906 Opinion Vote. The building was renovated, part of it converted into a small brewery, and reopened as a hotel in 1986. Railway Hotel opened in 1856 opposite the new Port Adelaide railway station, {{a month before the}} line to Adelaide was opened. The hotel retains many original features including leadlight windows and an 1890s glass fanlight.|$|E
25|$|The <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> is {{important}} because it embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, and method of construction in the mid-nineteenth century in rural Virginia. The buildings and resources of Plunkett-Meeks Store and storage building constitute a complete landscape typical of both a county government seat in Piedmont Virginia and of a farming community in the mid-nineteenth century in rural Virginia. It has historical meaning to the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park by virtue of its association with the site of General Robert E. Lee's surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant. The Plunkett-Meeks Store and storehouse building was registered and documented in the National Register of Historic Places on June 26, 1989.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Progressive {{collapse}} of <b>building</b> <b>structures</b> is generally {{triggered by a}} local failure due to accidental actions, followed by subsequent chain effect of the structures which may result in wide range failure or even {{collapse of}} the entire buildings. Since the “ 911 ” event, progressive collapse of <b>building</b> <b>structures</b> has been widely concerned by engineers and researchers. This paper assesses the current researches on this issue from experimental study, numerical simulation and theoretical analysis. Given the limitation of costs and difficulties of experimental tests, the experimental studies investigate the collapse mechanism, such as development of stress/strain and damage/failure of materials, mainly via the scaled down specimens of structural components and substructures. On the other hand, the collapse behavior of entire <b>building</b> <b>structures</b> is analyzed via the numerical methods, such as the finite {{element method and the}} discrete element method. Further, the collapse resistance demand and the robustness assessment for <b>building</b> <b>structures</b> are theoretically studied in depth in which the simplified theoretical models of the collapse-resisting demand and the collapse risk assessment are proposed respectively. At last, the design method to prevent progressive collapse for <b>building</b> <b>structures</b> is also discussed...|$|R

25|$|The former Main Roads Department Building is a 15-storey, {{reinforced}} concrete {{office building in}} a Modernist style that stands on a prominent site on Boundary Road, Spring Hill, Brisbane. Totalling almost one hectare, the rectangular site is bounded by Boundary Street to the south, Fortescue Street to the east, and Wedd Street to the north. Small-scale commercial and residential development adjoins the western boundary. The sloping terrain is terraced into large, flat platforms by concrete retaining walls. As well as a landscaped garden setting, the building comprises: a front portico; tower; service core; rear podium; and rear carpark. The <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> is a {{reinforced concrete}} grid of concrete columns supporting concrete floor slabs.|$|E
25|$|The By Town Curling Club was {{established}} in 1851 under the presidency of lumber businessman Allan Gilmour. Its earliest facility was a rudimentary shed located near Lisgar Street adjoining the Rideau Canal. Canal water was used to construct the single ice sheet. The club constructed a new rink on Albert Street east of O'Connor in 1867, expanding play to two sheets. In 1878, the club spent $510 to move the <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> to a property near Wellington Street west of Kent on the former Vittoria Street which is today federal property in the Supreme Court district. The rink structure {{was replaced by a}} brick building which opened in December 1906. In 1914, the club lost the land due to a significant federal government expropriation.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} soil {{liquefaction}} on {{the built environment}} can be extremely damaging. Buildings whose foundations bear directly on sand which liquefies will experience a sudden loss of support, which will result in drastic and irregular settlement of the building causing structural damage, including cracking of foundations and damage to the <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> itself, or may leave the structure unserviceable afterwards, even without structural damage. Where a thin crust of non-liquefied soil exists between building foundation and liquefied soil, a 'punching shear' type foundation failure may occur. The irregular settlement of ground may also break underground utility lines. The upward pressure applied by the movement of liquefied soil through the crust layer can crack weak foundation slabs and enter buildings through service ducts, and may allow water to damage the building contents and electrical services.|$|E

25|$|Following the Hotel New World {{collapse}} in 1986, the school management committee ordered a review on the <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> after {{walls in the}} college was reportedly ruptured. On 8 May 1987, Hwa Chong Junior College moved out of its premises at Bukit Timah Road due to structural problems with the building. The campus was redeveloped the following year, with the Ministry of Education covering 80 per cent of cost of standard facilities for the three-year long redevelopment project, the College itself raised the remaining $7 million. Between May to December 1987, lessons were held temporarily at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and in Woodlands. The college shifted to Bukit Batok Street 34 (present-day site of Swiss Cottage Secondary School and St. Anthony's Primary School) later. HCJC moved back to its Bukit Timah campus in 1992. The new building had considerable changes to the architecture style, while the octagonal layout remained in the new building. The rebuilt campus also features {{the largest and most}} comprehensive library among all junior colleges in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Contributing {{properties}} are defined through historic district or historic preservation zoning laws, usually {{at the local}} level. Zoning ordinances pertaining to historic districts are designed to maintain a district's historic character by controlling demolition and alteration to existing properties. In historic preservation law, a contributing property is any <b>building,</b> <b>structure,</b> object or site {{within the boundaries of}} the district that contributes to its historic associations, historic architectural qualities or archaeological qualities of a historic district. It can be any property, structure or object that adds to the historic integrity or architectural qualities that make the historic district, either local or federal, significant. Definitions vary but, in general, they maintain the same characteristics. Another key aspect of a contributing property is historic integrity. Significant alterations to a property can sever its physical connections with the past, lowering its historic integrity. Contributing {{properties are}} integral parts of the historic context and character of a historic district. A property listed as a contributing member of a historic district meets National Register criteria and qualifies for all benefits afforded a property or site listed individually on the National Register.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Barclays Bank {{proposed}} a redevelopment of 55-73 Colmore Row. The scheme involved {{the demolition of}} the entire building except for the façades and the banking hall of the listed building. The local planning authority called for greater retention of the <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> as with other schemes in the area. The agents submitted multiple planning applications {{to put pressure on}} the planning department. As the planning department failed to come to a decision on two planning applications in their time periods, the bank took the case to a government department. Barclays and local planning authority failed to reach any deal in negotiations, which eventually broke down. The government saw that the retention of the façade was satisfactory as it allowed the economic reuse of the site. The decision left the development and design framework for the area in a weakened state as the building subject to the decision was deemed to be of less national importance in respect to its local importance. The use of façadism on the building has since been seen as successful following the addition of Mansard roofs providing additional floorspace.|$|E
