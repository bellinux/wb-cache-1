5|$|In 2006 the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage {{announced}} {{they would be}} working to preserve the railways and ferries, and in 2008 it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the directorate was working with an application for the Rjukan Line, the Tinnoset Line and the ferries {{to be included in}} a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the closed plants in Rjukan and Odda.|$|E
5|$|It <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Auschwitz was not {{a normal}} {{internment}} camp with above-average SS rations, but that it served an additional function.

When he inquired further, his colleagues confirmed that the Jews were being systematically exterminated and that this had included the transport of prisoners who had arrived the previous night.|$|E

5|$|As it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} to be no {{reversal}} of Spanish American independence, several of the new states began to receive international recognition. Early, in 1822, the United States recognized Chile, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, Peru, Gran Colombia, and Mexico. Britain waited until 1825, after the Battle of Ayacucho, to recognize Mexico, Gran Colombia, and Río de la Plata. Both nations recognized more Spanish American states in the next few years.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the war, McClellan and his family went to Europe (not returning until 1868), during which he did not participate in politics. When he returned, the Democratic Party expressed some interest in nominating him for president again, but when it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Ulysses S. Grant would be the Republican candidate, this interest died. McClellan worked on engineering projects in New York City and was offered the position of president of the newly formed University of California.|$|E

5|$|Belle Vue was {{the first}} privately financed zoo in England, and grew to become the third-largest in the UK. Jennison's {{original}} idea was that the gardens should be primarily a botanical excursion, but it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the public {{was interested in the}} animals as an attraction in their own right. The initial collection had consisted of domestic birds and a few exotic parrots, but Jennison probably also acquired those animals that could not be sold after the Manchester Zoological Gardens closed in 1842. By 1856, the Jennisons had added kangaroos, rhinos, lions, bears and gazelles.|$|E
5|$|Both Sherman and McKinley {{sought a}} {{peaceful}} resolution to the Cuban War, preferably involving an independent Cuba without American intervention. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for anything less. In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed.|$|E

5|$|Gill {{played in}} almost every game after the League Cup Final until Francis left the club the {{following}} October, but lost his place soon afterwards through injury. Though he did then receive a League Cup runners-up medal: club secretary Alan Jones had kept a spare one back, which he presented to Gill after Francis left. Under new manager Steve Bruce he played only one game, a 3–0 FA Cup defeat at Liverpool for which Jeff Kenna was cup-tied, and when the team won promotion to the Premier League that season, it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> his future lay elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In May 1942, the Australian {{government}} appointed Air Vice Marshal George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Planica event and following numerous near-flat ground landings, it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> ski flying had once again outgrown an older hill and needed enlarging in the years to come. In 2005, almost immediately after the conclusion of the World Cup season, talks were under way to upgrade the hill in Vikersund. This became a reality in mid-2010, when the FIS announced major rule changes at the 47th International Ski Congress in Antalya, Turkey, to allow for ski flying hills to be constructed to their largest sizes yet.|$|E
