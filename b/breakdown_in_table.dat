40|$|Almost every star in our Galaxy {{is likely}} to harbor a {{terrestrial}} planet, but accurate measurements of an exoplanet's mass and radius demands accurate knowledge of the properties of its host star. The imminent TESS and CHEOPS missions are slated to discover thousands of new exoplanets. Along with WFIRST, which will directly image nearby planets, these surveys make urgent the need to better characterize stars in the nearby solar neighborhood (< 30 pc). We have compiled the CATalog of Stellar Unified Properties (CATSUP) for 951 stars, including such data as: Gaia astrometry; multiplicity within stellar systems; stellar elemental abundance measurements; standardized spectral types; Ca II H and K stellar activity indices; GALEX NUV and FUV photometry; and X-ray fluxes and luminosities from ROSAT, XMM, and Chandra. We use this data-rich catalog to find correlations, especially between stellar emission indices, colors, and galactic velocity. Additionally, we demonstrate that thick-disk stars in the sample are generally older, have lower activity, and have higher velocities normal to the galactic plane. We anticipate CATSUP will be useful in discerning other trends among stars within the nearby solar neighborhood, for comparing thin-disk vs. thick-disk stars, for comparing stars with and without planets, and for finding correlations between chemical and kinematic properties.

It will highlight how patient-perceived <b>breakdowns</b> <b>in</b> care can impede the delivery of patient-centered care, including shared decision-making. It will conclude by exploring the central role of frontline clinicians in responding to patient reports of <b>breakdowns</b> <b>in</b> care, including potential facilitators and barriers to addressing patient concerns about <b>breakdowns</b> <b>in</b> care.

40|$|Abstract. Collaborative {{information}} seeking {{is integral to}} many professional activities. In hospital work, the medication process encompasses continual seeking for information and collaborative grounding of information. This study investigates <b>breakdowns</b> <b>in</b> collaborative {{information seeking}} through analyses {{of the use of}} the electronic medication record adopted in a Danish healthcare region and of the reports of five years of medication incidents at Danish hospitals. The results show that <b>breakdowns</b> <b>in</b> collaborative information seeking is a major source of medication incidents, that most of these <b>breakdowns</b> are <b>breakdowns</b> <b>in</b> collaborative grounding rather than information seeking, that the medication incidents mainly concern <b>breakdowns</b> <b>in</b> the use of records as opposed to oral communication, that the breakdowns span multiple degrees of separation between clinicians, and that the electronic medication record has introduced risks of new kinds of <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> collaborative information seeking. In working to prevent and recover from <b>breakdowns</b> <b>in</b> the seeking and sharing of information a focus on collaborative information seeking will point toward collaborative, organizational, and systemic reasons for breakdown and areas for improvement, rather than toward individual error...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Increasing {{the power}} {{handling}} capabilities of rf components {{is an important}} issue for the design of rf accelerators and rf sources. RF breakdown is a phenomena that limit the high power performance. A major concern is the damage that can occur in rf components from breakdown. To better understand this damage, we have studied rf <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> a rectangular waveguide experimentally and theoretically. The <b>breakdown</b> process <b>in</b> a waveguide is both easier to measure and simulate than <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> a complex geometry such as an accelerating structure. We used a particle tracking code and a Particle-In-Cell code to model the breakdown behavior. Models developed for the waveguide were applied to the <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> accelerating structures. RF <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> traveling wave and standing wave accelerating structures was simulated. We compare the experimental data with results of the simulations for the accelerating structures...|$|R
