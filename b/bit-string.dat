50|$|<b>Bit-string</b> {{physics is}} an body of theory which supposes that reality can be {{represented}} by a process of operations on finite strings of dichotomous symbols, or bits (1's and 0's). <b>Bit-string</b> physics has developed from Frederick Parker-Rhodes' 1964 discovery of the combinatorial hierarchy: four numbers produced from a purely mathematical recursive algorithm that correspond to the relative strengths of the four forces.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} about relating formal and computational models of cryptography in case of active adversaries when formal security analysis is done with first order logic. We first argue that the way Datta et al. defined computational semantics to their Protocol Composition Logic gives rise to problems because of focusing on occurrences of <b>bit-strings</b> on individual traces instead of occurrences of probability distributions of <b>bit-strings</b> across the distribution of traces. We therefore introduce a new, fully probabilistic method to assign computational semantics to the syntax. We present this via considering a simple {{example of such a}} formal model, the Basic Protocol Logic by K. Hasebe and M. Okada [19], but the technique is suitable for extensions to more complex situations such as PCL. The idea is {{to make use of the}} usual mathematical treatment of stochastic processes, hence be able to treat arbitrary probability distributions, non-negligible probability of collision, causal dependence or independence, and so on. Along the way, we also point out some instances of the original syntax that had to be modified, as – although sound for formal semantics – they were not sound for computational semantics...|$|R

40|$|The {{language}} competition model of Viviane de Oliveira et al is modified by associating with each language {{a string of}} 32 bits. Whenever a language changes in this Viviane model, also one randomly selected bit is flipped. If then only languages with different <b>bit-strings</b> are counted as different, the resulting size distribution of languages agrees with the empirically observed slightly asymmetric log-normal distribution. Several other modifications were also tried but either had more free parameters or agreed less well with reality. ...|$|R

5000|$|When {{a random}} oracle is used within a {{security}} proof, {{it is made}} available to all players, including the adversary or adversaries.

40|$|Set {{is widely}} used {{as a kind of}} basic data structure. However, when it is used for large scale data set the cost of storage, search and {{transport}} is overhead. The bloom filter uses a fixed size bit string to represent elements in a static set, which can reduce storage space and search cost that is a fixed constant. The time-space efficiency is achieved at the cost of a small probability of false positive in membership query. However, for many applications the space savings and locating time constantly outweigh this drawback. Dynamic bloom filter (DBF) can support concisely representation and approximate membership queries of dynamic set instead of static set. It has been proved that DBF not only possess the advantage of standard bloom filter, but also has better features when dealing with dynamic set. This paper proposes a time-dependent multiple <b>bit-strings</b> bloom filter (TMBF) which roots in the DBF and targets on dynamic incremental set. TMBF uses multiple <b>bit-strings</b> in time order to present a dynamic increasing set and uses backward searching to test whether an element is in a set. Based on the system logs from a real P 2 P file sharing system, the evaluation shows a 20 % reduction in searching cost compared to DBF...|$|R
40|$|Sampling {{from the}} output {{distribution}} of chaotic quantum evolutions, and of pseudo-random universal quantum circuits in particular, {{has been proposed}} as a prominent milestone for near-term quantum supremacy. The same paper notes that chaotic distributions {{are very sensitive to}} noise, and under quite general noise models converge to the uniform distribution over <b>bit-strings</b> exponentially in the number of gates. On the one hand, for increasing number of gates, it suffices to choose <b>bit-strings</b> at random to approximate the noisy distribution with fixed statistical distance. On the other hand, cross-entropy benchmarking can be used to gauge the fidelity of an experiment, and the distance to the uniform distribution. We estimate that state-of-the-art classical supercomputers would fail to simulate high-fidelity chaotic quantum circuits with approximately fifty qubits and depth forty. A recent interesting paper proposed a different approximation algorithm to a noisy distribution, extending previous results on the Fourier analysis of commuting quantum circuits. Using the statistical properties of the Porter-Thomas distribution, we show that this new approximation algorithm does not improve random guessing, in polynomial time. Therefore, it confirms previous results and does not represent an additional challenge to the suggested failure stated above. Comment: 4 + 1 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
