5|$|Mountain birds around Helvellyn {{include the}} raven (Corvus corax), {{which has now}} become common. Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), buzzards (Buteo buteo) and ring ouzels (Turdus torquatus) have all bred in the {{immediate}} area. Skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) are frequently encountered. At one time eagles (probably Aquila chrysaetos) soared over the mountain and bred on the steep cliffs above Red Tarn, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> Wordsworth's day they had gone, having been persecuted to extinction.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of the short pulsed electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, arc welding developed slowly. C. L. Coffin had the idea of welding in an inert gas atmosphere in 1890, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> the early 20th century, welding non-ferrous materials such as aluminum and magnesium remained difficult because these metals react rapidly with the air and result in porous, dross-filled welds. Processes using flux-covered electrodes did not satisfactorily protect the weld area from contamination. To solve the problem, bottled inert gases were used {{in the beginning of the}} 1930s. A few years later, a direct current, gas-shielded welding process emerged in the aircraft industry for welding magnesium.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} risk {{and severity of}} serotonergic side effects and serotonin toxicity, with individual drugs and combinations, is complex. Serotonin syndrome {{has been reported in}} patients of all ages, including the elderly, children, and even newborn infants due to in utero exposure. The serotonergic toxicity of SSRIs increases with dose, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> over-dose it is insufficient to cause fatalities from serotonin syndrome in healthy adults. Elevations of central nervous system serotonin will typically only reach potentially fatal levels when drugs with different mechanisms of action are mixed together. Various drugs, other than SSRIs, also have clinically significant potency as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, (e.g. tramadol, amphetamine, and MDMA) and are associated with severe cases of the syndrome.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{standing}} {{fresh water}} on Caroline Island, although the Nake and South Islets harbor underground freshwater aquifers (or Ghyben-Herzberg lenses), and wells {{have been built}} to tap drinking water for temporary settlements. Soils on Caroline are similarly poor, dominated by coral gravel and sand, with significant organic content present only within stable, forested island centers. Guano deposits make island soil, where it does exist, nitrogen-rich; <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> {{the oldest and most}} vegetated regions of the atoll, soils are only a few centimeters (one or two inches) thick.|$|E
5|$|Several rebellions erupted {{during the}} regency. The first were the Rebellion of Santa Rita (1831), the Revolt of the Year of the Smoke (1833) and the Cabanada (or War of the Cabanos, 1832–34), which sought {{the return of}} Pedro I and which {{had the support of}} common people, former slaves, and slaves. The death of Pedro I on 24 September 1834 ended their hopes. The {{promulgation}} of the Additional Act in 1834, a constitutional amendment that gave higher administrative and political provincial decentralization, exacerbated conflicts between political parties, as whichever dominated the provinces would also gain control over the electoral and political system. Those parties which lost elections rebelled and tried to assume power by force. Rebellious factions, however, continued to uphold the Throne as a way of giving the appearance of legitimacy to their actions (that is, they were not in revolt against the monarchy per se). The Cabanagem (1835–40), the Sabinada (1837–38) and the Balaiada (1838–41) all followed this course, even though in some instances provinces attempted to secede and become independent republics (though ostensibly only so long as Pedro II was a minor). The exception was the Ragamuffin War, which began as yet another dispute between political factions in the province of Rio Grande do Sul but quickly evolved into a separatist rebellion financed by the Argentine dictator Don Manuel Rosas. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> this case, the majority of the province's population, including the largest and most prosperous cities, remained loyal to the Empire.|$|E
5|$|The African {{species is}} a partial migrant, but its {{movements}} are complex, seasonal and poorly studied. It is mainly a wet-season breeder, and many birds {{move away from}} the equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow them to breed elsewhere. Southward movement is mainly from November to April, the return north beginning when burning or drought reduces the grass cover again. This species is present throughout the year in some West African countries, and in equatorial regions, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> those areas numbers vary seasonally due to local movements; internal north–south migration has been noted within countries including Nigeria, Senegal, The Gambia, Côte d'Ivoire and Cameroon. This crake has also wandered further afield. It is rare on Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea), and there have been two records each for São Tomé and Tenerife, the Canary Islands birds being the first records for the Western Palaeartic.|$|E

5|$|This crake is {{a partial}} migrant, but {{although}} it is less skulking than many of its relatives, its movements are complex and poorly studied; the distribution map is therefore largely hypothetical. It is mainly a wet-season breeder, and many birds {{move away from the}} equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow them to breed elsewhere. Southward movement is mainly from November to April, the return north beginning when burning or drought reduces the grass cover again. This species is present throughout the year in some West African countries, and in equatorial regions, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> those areas numbers vary seasonally due to local movements; north-south migration has been noted within countries including Nigeria, Senegal, The Gambia, Ivory Coast and Cameroon. Migration takes place at night and involves small groups of up to eight birds; It may be one or two months after the rains begin before the grass is sufficiently high for breeding birds to arrive. Even in southern Africa, some birds may stay after breeding if enough usable habitat remains.|$|E
5|$|The vannus is {{bordered by}} the vannal fold, which {{typically}} occurs between the postcubitus {{and the first}} vannal vein. In Orthoptera it usually has this position. In the forewing of Blattidae, however, the only fold {{in this part of}} the wing lies immediately before the postcubitus. In Plecoptera the vannal fold is posterior to the postcubitus, but proximally it crosses the base of the first vannal vein. In the cicada the vannal fold lies immediately behind the first vannal vein (lV). These small variations in the actual position of the vannal fold, however, do not affect the unity of action of the vannal veins, controlled by the flexor sclerite (3Ax), in the flexion of the wing. In the hindwings of most Orthoptera a secondary vena dividens forms a rib in the vannal fold. The vannus is usually triangular in shape, and its veins typically spread out from the third axillary like the ribs of a fan. Some of the vannal veins may be branched, and secondary veins may alternate with the primary veins. The vannal region is usually best developed in the hindwing, in which it may be enlarged to form a sustaining surface, as in Plecoptera and Orthoptera. The great fanlike expansions of the hindwings of Acrididae are clearly the vannal regions, since their veins are all supported on the third axillary sclerites on the wing bases, though Martynov (1925) ascribes most of the fan areas in Acrididae to the jugal regions of the wings. The true jugum of the acridid wing is represented only by the small membrane (Ju) mesad of the last vannal vein. The jugum is more highly developed in some other Polyneoptera, as in the Mantidae. In most of the higher insects with narrow wings the vannus becomes reduced, and the vannal fold is lost, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> such cases the flexed wing may bend along a line between the postcubitus and the first vannal vein.|$|E
