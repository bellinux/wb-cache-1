25|$|The {{earliest}} document accusing Freemasonry {{of being}} involved in a conspiracy was Enthüllungen des Systems der Weltbürger-Politik (“Disclosure of the System of Cosmopolitan Politics”), published in 1786. The book claimed that there was a conspiracy of Freemasons, Illuminati and Jesuits who were plotting world revolution. During the 19th Century, this theory was repeated by many Christian counter-revolutionaries, who saw Freemasons as being <b>behind</b> <b>every</b> attack on the existing social system.|$|E

In Minds and Gods: The Cognitive Foundations of Religion, Todd Tremlin follows Boyer in arguing that universal human cognitive process naturally produces {{the concept of the}} supernatural. Tremlin contends that an agency detection device (ADD) and a theory of mind module (ToMM) lead humans to suspect an agent <b>behind</b> <b>every</b> event. Natural events {{for which there is no}} obvious agent may be attributed to God (c.f. Act of God).|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the move}} to Frostbite, BioWare decided to unite the combat systems of the single and {{multiplayer}} modes. In Mass Effect 3, the single-player mode used a system tailored to a slower, cover shooter approach while the multiplayer mode used a system tailored to a faster-paced approach. It was important to BioWare that, for all gameplay modes in Mass Effect: Andromeda, the player stay moving and have a strategy <b>behind</b> <b>every</b> action as opposed to remaining in one location for the entire duration of an encounter. To encourage players to play this way, BioWare built open combat layouts, which required the programming of complex artificial intelligence so that enemies could understand space {{and know how to}} flank the player from all angles.|$|E
25|$|When we {{point out}} the need of {{opposing}} Trotskyism we discover a very strange phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense {{in the ranks of}} certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. We saw this on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; we saw this clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And everybody will realize this when the trial opens against the P.O.U.M. leaders who were caught spying. And we realize that the hand of Fascism is <b>behind</b> <b>every</b> attempt to demoralize our home front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it is essential that we wipe out Trotskyism with a firm hand, for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.|$|E

[...] However, Kiedis recalls that during the {{composition}} of the album, Beinhorn encouraged him to step away from his improvisational speed-rap style in favor of slower, crooning vocals. At the time, Kiedis was very uncomfortable with his singing voice, and felt that the new style was [...] "sappy". Kiedis also observed that guitarist Hillel Slovak's playing evolved during his time away from the group in What Is This?, and that Slovak had adopted a more fluid style featuring [...] "sultry" [...] elements as opposed to his original hard rock techniques.|$|E

500|$|La Dulzura {{represented}} a stylistic departure for the group, both musically and lyrically. The song [...] "Del Tope al Fondo" [...] {{is influenced by}} Argentine music, especially the genre of tango. Lyrically, the band discusses more romantic themes {{as opposed to the}} political emphasis of the group's previous records. [...] Guitarist Eliut Gonzalez remarked that the band aimed to shift discussion to [...] "the good things in the world", explaining [...] that [...] "We know that people need help, and that <b>behind</b> <b>every</b> revolution or movement, there is love. We wanted to document that in our music, but without doing it in a cheesy or typical way." [...] The singles [...] "Baja la Tensión", [...] "La Complicidad", [...] "Para Estar" [...] and [...] "Ilegal" [...] all charted on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart. In 2011, the group collaborated with Dominican musician Vicente García on his single [...] "Mi Balcón".|$|E
500|$|The book Teen Spirit: The Stories <b>Behind</b> <b>Every</b> Nirvana Song {{describes}} [...] "Teen Spirit" [...] as [...] "a typically murky Cobain {{exploration of}} meaning and meaninglessness." [...] Azerrad plays upon the juxtaposition of Cobain's contradictory lyrics (such as [...] "It's fun to lose and to pretend") and states [...] "the point that emerges isn't just the conflict of two opposing ideas, but the confusion and anger that the conflict produces in the narrator—he's angry that he's confused." [...] Azerrad's conclusion is that the song is [...] "alternately a sarcastic reaction {{to the idea of}} actually having a revolution, yet it also embraces the idea." [...] In Heavier Than Heaven, Charles R. Cross' biography of Kurt Cobain, the author argues that the song is a reference to Cobain's relationship with ex-girlfriend Tobi Vail. Cross cites the line [...] "She's over-bored and self-assured" [...] and states the song [...] "could not have been about anyone else." [...] Cross backs up his argument with lyrics which were present in earlier drafts, such as [...] "Who will be the King & Queen of the outcasted [...] teens." ...|$|E

Lomax, with the transcription being done by Ruth Crawford Seeger. [...] The recording was released in 1942 by the Library of Congress as Archive of Folk Song, Recording Laboratory AFS L3 Folk Music of the United States: Afro American Spirituals, Work Songs and Ballads, a collection of field recordings including those by State Penitentiary and State Farm prisoners. [...] It first appeared on 78 rpm records, then was released again on LP album in the mid-1960s. [...] In 1998, it was issued by Rounder Records on Compact Disc as Afro-American Spirituals, Work Songs & Ballads, which is also available from the Library of Congress. [...] It also appears on the CD The Ballad Hunter, Parts VII and VIII from the Library of Congress, originally issued as Archive of Folk Song, Recording Laboratory AFS L52 in 1941.|$|E

500|$|Describing {{the various}} songs on Bleach, Christopher Sandford wrote: [...] "'Paper Cuts' {{includes}} a folk-influence melody and ponderous rhythm {{of an early}} Led Zeppelin number; 'Mr. Moustache' addressed itself to Nirvana's male fans; 'Downer' showed the same exceptional contempt for the group's audience". Sandford felt [...] "School" [...] – which features only four lines of lyrics – was memorable for its chorus that [...] "served as the rip". While [...] "Scoff" [...] is [...] "a parting salvo at [...] ", [...] "Negative Creep" [...] was written by Cobain about himself. According to Sandford, [...] "About a Girl" [...] has a [...] "chiming melody and ironic chorus". In Sounds magazine, Keith Cameron said the song [...] "was exhilarating and it was exciting {{because that was the}} nature of the music, but there was also an almost palpable sense of danger, that this whole thing could fall apart any second. There was never any relaxation from the first note to the last". In his book Nirvana: The Stories <b>Behind</b> <b>Every</b> Song, Chuck Crisafulli writes that the song [...] "stands out in the Cobain canon as a song with a very specific genesis and a very real subject".|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "The Message", {{featuring}} a male lead vocalist, parodies {{the words of}} the traditional song [...] "Dem Bones" [...] to link Google to [...] "the government". Kitty Empire wrote in The Observer that these conspiratorial government connections to Google and the thoughts of Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova, the Russian teenager who bombed Moscow's tube system in revenge for the death of her husband, were inner-world issues pondered in [...] "Lovalot" [...] with [...] "a mixture of nonsense rhyme, militant posturing and pop-cultural free-flow; her London glottal stop mischievously turns 'I love a lot' into 'I love Allah'". Ann Powers in the Los Angeles Times said that [...] "M.I.A. turns a call to action into a scared girl's nervous tic. Synths click out a jittery, jagged background. The song doesn't justify anything, but it reminds us that there is a person <b>behind</b> <b>every</b> lit fuse". Powers also commented on how [...] "Born Free" [...] mixed the boasting style often found in hip hop music with lines depicting the lives of those enduring poverty and persecution. [...] "Illygirl", a track found only on the deluxe edition of the album, is written {{from the point of view}} of an abused but tough teenager, whom critic Robert Christgau said could be the [...] "kid-sister-in-metaphor" [...] of the swaggering persona adopted by M.I.A. on the track [...] "Steppin Up".|$|E
500|$|By 19:00, Franchise had {{dumped her}} {{lifeboats}} {{and a large}} quantity of guns and supplies overboard, lightening the ship {{enough for her to}} far outstrip the pursuit. As night fell the French frigate made a full escape from the British force. Médée however had not escaped. Although Bombay Castle was many miles behind, only distantly visible on the horizon, Exeter had been able to follow the frigate closely. Meriton was aware that the French warship was much stronger than his own merchant vessel, but realized that as the frigate had made no effort to fight, her commander must believe Exeter to be a ship of the line. To reinforce this image in the rapidly approaching darkness, Meriton arranged lights <b>behind</b> <b>every</b> gunport, whether or not it contained a cannon, creating an effect described as [...] "a fearsome, leering jack-o'-lantern". As his ship drew level with the French frigate, Meriton hailed the enemy's deck, calling on them to surrender. Intimidated by this large and seemingly powerful enemy, Coudin decided that his only option was to strike his flag and come aboard the British ship to surrender formally. Arriving on board, he was astonished to see far fewer and smaller guns than a warship normally carried. When Coudin asked to whom he had surrendered, Meriton is said to have replied [...] "To a merchantman". Appalled, Coudin demanded to be allowed to return to his ship and conduct a formal naval battle, but Meriton refused.|$|E

500|$|Two Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, Patricia Hussey and Barbara Ferraro (no {{relation}} to Geraldine Ferraro), did not recant from their pro-choice positions. [...] Hussey and Ferraro, {{directors of the}} Covenant House in Charleston, West Virginia—a shelter for homeless and abused women and children—were supported by CFFC in their dispute with the Church. [...] By March 1986, Hussey and Ferraro were no longer calling for [...] "dialogue" [...] but were publicly demanding recognition of [...] "a woman's right to choose." [...] In July 1986 when the two nuns were pressured more strongly with expulsion, 11 of the other nuns who signed came forward with a statement in solidarity with them, denying a recent Vatican announcement that all nuns but Hussey and Ferraro were now aligned with the Church's position on abortion. The eleven complained of the Church's divisive tactics, which they said were intended to isolate Hussey and Ferraro. Signer Maureen Fiedler said, [...] "I have never retracted or recanted one syllable of the Catholic Statement on Abortion and Pluralism. I continue to stand <b>behind</b> <b>every</b> word of it without the slightest reservation." [...] After nearly four years of dispute, Hussey and Ferraro were informed by their order's leadership in June 1988 {{that they would not}} be dismissed from the order. However, the leadership of the School Sisters of Notre Dame distanced the order from Hussey and Ferraro, calling them [...] "intransigent" [...] and stating that they [...] "have in practice placed themselves outside the life and mission of the congregation." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cocoon" [...] was {{received}} with positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic's Heather Phares called the song [...] "seductively alien". Seth Stevenson from Slate magazine gave a positive review to it, commenting {{that because of}} the song, Björk is [...] "actually at her best either barely murmuring or full-out yelling, and she may be the most stylized vocalist in music today". Michael Cragg from The Guardian commented that [...] "Vespertine is littered with defining moments. While the first single Hidden Place, the choir-assisted Undo and the Matmos collaboration Aurora are among the highlights, it's Cocoon that best represents the album's sense of heavy-lidded, post-coital hibernation". David Fricke from Rolling Stone commented that [...] "the flurry of rhythm" [...] {{at the start of the}} song felt like [...] "the gravity of a spider scurrying across linoleum". Ian Gittins, author of Björk: Human Behaviour - the Stories <b>Behind</b> <b>Every</b> Song, referred to [...] "Cocoon" [...] as the eyes of many of the most significant moments of Vespertine, as well as the most complete display and literal philosophy that the singer had taken for the album. British magazine NMEs Joe Logic was also positive saying, [...] "Soft organs and Rice Krispies (Eh? - Cereal Ed) feature heavily on a very minimalist 'Cocoon', a beautiful love song featuring Bjork whispering sexual lyrics over a track that To Rococo Rot would be proud of". Stephen Dalton from the same publication was less positive, and stated: [...] "Then there is the uncomfortably intimate, tremble-whisper Björk voice of 'Cocoon' where she relates the joy of shutting herself away with her lover with a broken music box and some mouldy old string".|$|E
