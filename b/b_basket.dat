40|$|The {{definitive}} version can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright Wiley-Blackwell [Full text {{of this article is}} not available in the UHRA]Background:??? Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the most common food allergy, and adherence to a milk-free diet is essential, particularly in immunoglobulin E-mediated CMPA sufferers (Benhamou et al., 2009). No studies have looked into the practical aspects of a milk-free diet. The aim of this project was to evaluate how the availability and cost of a milk-free diet compares with that of one containing cow's milk protein. Methods:??? A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the London Borough of Harrow and three major superstores in an urban setting (inclusion criteria of ??? 25 000 sq ft) were randomly selected. Two shopping baskets were created; basket A with commonly consumed foods (bread, biscuits, milk, packaged fruit/vegetable salads, and ready meals which contained ??? 12 % protein from nondairy protein sources) based on the Eatwell plate (Food Standards Agency, 2007), and <b>basket</b> <b>B</b> with their cow's milk-free alternatives. The price and number of varieties were recorded and analysed for each food group per basket. Pearson's chi-squared and Wilcoxon-rank sum tests were conducted for availability and cost of each food type in both baskets. Results:??? The availability of foods suitable for a CMPA diet (<b>basket</b> <b>B)</b> was lower than basket A: 74 % bread, 15 % biscuits, 26 % milk and 25 % ready meals compared to 26 %, 85 %, 74 % and 75 %, P-values of 0. 001, 0. 002, 0. 001 and 0. 005, respectively. The availability of fruit/vegetable salads was not statistically significant between the two baskets. Regarding cost, bread in basket A was found to be significantly more expensive than in <b>basket</b> <b>B,</b> whereas milk substitutes (all superstores) and ready meals (superstore 2 only) were significantly more expensive in <b>basket</b> <b>B</b> (Table 1). The cost of biscuits and fruit/vegetable salads between the two baskets was not significantly different...|$|R

50|$|In basketball, basket {{interference}} is {{the violation}} of (a) touching the ball or {{any part of the}} basket while the ball is {{on the rim of the}} <b>basket,</b> (<b>b)</b> touching the ball when it is within the cylinder extending upwards from the rim, (c) reaching up through the basket from below and touching the ball, whether it is inside or outside the cylinder, or (d) pulling down on the rim of the basket so that it contacts the ball before returning to its original position. How the ball gets into the cylinder or onto the basket is irrelevant under high school and NCAA rules; e.g., a throw-in touched within the cylinder is basket interference, even though such a play could not score a goal. This similar play under NBA rules would not be basket interference.|$|R

We investigate, via computer simulations, the biophysical mechanisms by which storage and recall of spatio-temporal input patterns are achieved by the CA 1 microcircuitry.

40|$|Microtubules are {{important}} for the growth and maintenance of stable neuronal processes and their organisation is controlled partly by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). MAP 1 B is the first MAP to be expressed in neurons and {{plays an important role}} in neurite outgrowth. MAP 1 B is phosphorylated at multiple sites and it is believed that the function of the protein is regulated by its phosphorylation state. We have shown that the monoclonal antibody (mAb) RT 97, which recognises phosphorylated epitopes on neurofilament proteins, fetal tau, and on Alzheimer's paired helical filament-tau, also recognises a developmentally regulated phosphorylation epitope on MAP 1 B. In the rat cerebellum, Western blot analysis shows that mAb RT 97 recognises the upper band of the MAP 1 B doublet and that the amount of this epitope peaks very early postnatally and decreases with increasing age so that it is absent in the adult, despite the continued expression of MAP 1 B in the adult. We confirmed that mAb RT 97 binds to MAP 1 B by showing that it recognises MAP 1 B immunoprecipitated from postnatal rat cerebellum using polyclonal antibodies to recombinant MAP 1 B proteins. We established that the RT 97 epitope on MAP 1 B is phosphorylated by showing that antibody binding was abolished by alkaline phosphatase treatment of immunoblots. Epitope mapping experiments suggest that the mAb RT 97 site on MAP 1 B is near the N-terminus of the molecule. Despite our immunoblotting data, immunostaining of sections of postnatal rat cerebellum with mAb RT 97 shows a staining pattern typical of neurofilaments with no apparent staining of MAP 1 <b>B.</b> For instance, <b>basket</b> cell axons and axons in the granule cell layer and white matter stained, whereas parallel fibres did not. These results suggest that the MAP 1 B epitope is masked or lost under the immunocytochemical conditions in which the cerebellar sections are prepared. The upper band of the MAP 1 B doublet is believed to be predominantly phosphorylated by proline-directed protein kinases(PDPKs). PDPKs are also good candidates for phosphorylating neurofilament proteins and tau and therefore we postulate that the sites recognised by RT 97 on these neuronal cytoskeletal proteins may be phosphorylated by similar kinases. Important goals are to determine the precise location of the RT 97 epitope on MAP 1 B and the kinase responsible...|$|R
