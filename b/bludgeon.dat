5|$|The Decepticon {{scientist}} Shockwave {{begins the}} secretive Operation: Regenesis — seeding Energon on various planets, including Earth. While stabilizing Earth's seeding, the Dynobots attack Shockwave, {{and they are}} all buried in molten lava for thousands of years. <b>Bludgeon</b> is assigned by Megatron to investigate Operation: Regenesis and Soundwave is told to spy on him. In 1984, Soundwave learns to his horror that <b>Bludgeon</b> intends to use the Ultra-Energon on Earth to re-animate Thunderwing, but is silenced and put into stasis-lock in his cassette player mode. The following year, an organization named Skywatch find Laserbeak and Ravage's bodies. Starscream and his unit later come to Earth, discover Shockwave's Energon and mine it in Nebraska. When they exhaust this supply in 2006, they move to Oregon, entering siege mode to protect their discovery. As part of their plan to acquire a Transformer, an agent working for the Machination takes a photo of a Decepticon transforming and locates the original Decepticon base. As a response he is targeted and killed by Thundercracker, Runabout and Runamuck. Before his death, his laptop with the photo is stolen by a girl named Verity Carlo and she is taken to the Autobots - inadvertently leading the Machination straight to them via a homing device in the laptop.|$|E

5|$|Halo {{departs from}} {{traditional}} FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to holster its firearm before deploying grenades or melee-range blunt instruments; instead, both attacks can be utilized while a gun is still equipped, supplanting or supplementing small-arms fire. All weapons {{may be used}} to <b>bludgeon</b> enemies, which allows Master Chief to silently kill opponents without alerting other nearby enemies. The Chief can also carry up to eight grenades at a time: up to four fragmentation and four plasma grenades each. Like the game's other weapons, the two types of grenades differ; the fragmentation grenade bounces and detonates quickly, whereas the plasma grenade adheres to targets before exploding, sometimes with blackly comic results.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, A, B and C Troops were {{dispatched}} to the Outer Hebrides {{under the command of}} Captain Lord Lovat for extra training. Returning to Troon in March, they were immediately sent to Dartmouth, Devon where they embarked on HMS Prins Albert. Once on board they were informed about Operation <b>Bludgeon</b> and started mission training. The objective of this raid was a large building that was a short distance inland from the Dutch coast, and that was used by senior German officers. For the duration of the operation BTroop were issued with flamethrowers to set the building on fire. After several days training, the commandos moved around the coast and anchored in the Thames waiting for the order to go. The operation was eventually cancelled, due to the increased German E-Boat activity {{in the area of the}} landing.|$|E

25|$|In volume 4, G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers: Black Horizon, Hawk {{leaves the}} G.I. Joe team, after {{allegations}} {{of the events}} that occurred in Area 51, which branded him a traitor. He is still connected to the Matrix, and is troubled each night by a specific nightmare, which shows a future in which all humanity is destroyed. During an interview, Hawk is summoned by the Autobots, whom he is secretly working for, because they have discovered an ancient race in the Himalayan Mountains. Hawk investigates with the aid of Flint and Optimus Prime, and there they encounter <b>Bludgeon</b> and Cobra-La. As they are escaping, Prime is attacked by <b>Bludgeon.</b> Hawk uses his connection to the Matrix and uploads Energon energy to <b>Bludgeon,</b> which temporarily knocks him out. They find that they are trapped, until they meet General Joseph Colton, who knows of Hawk. Colton leads them further inside, and after a few battles with the Honor Guard of Cobra-La, the Joes put together a plan to save the day. Flint goes into space with spores designed to destroy technology, while Colton, Hawk, and Optimus Prime rescue Firewall and stop Cobra-La. Hawk faces off against Golobulus, and is aided by Optimus Prime. As the series ends, Hawk is seen again with the woman he once left, trying to put his life back together.|$|E
25|$|Smashers {{possess a}} much more {{developed}} club and a more rudimentary spear (which is nevertheless quite sharp and still used in fights between their own kind); the club is used to <b>bludgeon</b> and smash their meals apart. The inner aspect of the terminal portion of the appendage can also possess a sharp edge, used to cut prey while the mantis shrimp swims.|$|E
25|$|A club (also {{known as}} a cudgel, baton, truncheon, cosh, nightstick, or <b>bludgeon)</b> is among the {{simplest}} of all weapons: a short staff or stick, usually made of wood, wielded as a weapon since prehistoric times.

In Cinthio's tale, for example, the ensign suffers an unrequited lust for the Moor's wife, Desdemona, which then drives his vengeance. Desdemona dies {{in an entirely different}} manner in Cinthio's tale; the Moor commissions his ensign to <b>bludgeon</b> her to death with a sand-filled stocking. In gruesome detail, Cinthio follows each blow, and, when she is dead, the Moor and his ensign place her lifeless body upon her bed, smash her skull, and then cause the cracked ceiling above the bed to collapse upon her, giving the impression the falling rafters caused her death.|$|E
25|$|Confusion with Carangoides orthogrammus in Hawaiian waters led John Nichols {{to propose}} {{subspecies}} of Carangoides gymnostethoides due to slight anatomical differences. These taxa possibly represent misidentified C. orthogrammus, although Nichols meticulous distinction {{of the species}} may indicate a population of the species may exist in Hawaii, although these subspecies have largely been ignored by taxonomic authorities and remained unresolved. The species has the unusual common name of 'bludger', which {{is said to have}} arisen by one of two ways; either due to the blunt shape of the species snout or a description of the eventual destination of the fish when caught by professional fishermen seeking more desirable catches. In both cases, the word 'bludger' refers to an object used to <b>bludgeon.</b>|$|E
25|$|Orangutans {{living in}} Borneo {{scavenge}} fish that wash {{up along the}} shore and scoop catfish out of small ponds for fresh meals. Over two years, anthropologist Anne Russon saw several animals on these forested islands learn {{on their own to}} jab at catfish with sticks, so that the panicked prey would flop out of ponds and into the orangutan's waiting hands. Although orangutans usually fished alone, Russon observed pairs of apes catching catfish on a few occasions. On the island of Kaja in Borneo, a male orangutan was observed using a pole apparently trying to spear or <b>bludgeon</b> fish. This individual had seen humans fishing with spears. Although not successful, he was later able to improvise by using the pole to catch fish already trapped in the locals' fishing lines.|$|E

25|$|To gain {{cooperation}} from Indonesian population {{and to prevent}} resistance to these measures, the Japanese put Sukarno as head of Tiga-A mass organisation movement. In March 1943, the Japanese formed a new organisation called Poesat Tenaga Rakjat (POETERA/ Center of People's Power) under Sukarno, Hatta, Ki Hadjar Dewantara, and KH Mas Mansjoer. The aim of these organisations were to galvanise popular support for recruitment of romusha forced labor, requisitioning of food products, and to promote pro-Japanese and anti-Western sentiments amongst Indonesians. Sukarno coined the term, Amerika kita setrika, Inggris kita linggis ("Let's iron America, and <b>bludgeon</b> the British") to promote anti-Allied sentiments. In later years, Sukarno was lastingly ashamed of his role with the romusha. Additionally, food requisitioning by the Japanese caused widespread famine in Java which killed {{more than one million}} people in 1944–1945. In his view, these were necessary sacrifices to be made to allow for future independence of Indonesia. He also was involved with the formation of Pembela Tanah Air (PETA) and Heiho (Indonesian volunteer army troops) via speeches broadcast on the Japanese radio and loud speaker networks across Java and Sumatra. By mid-1945 these units numbered around two million, and were preparing to defeat any Allied forces sent to re-take Java.|$|E
