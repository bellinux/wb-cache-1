5|$|During Marostica's {{first months}} in the position, he helped lead Colorado's effort to keep Frontier Airlines jobs in Denver {{following}} its merger with Republic Airways; ultimately, Frontier moved several hundred jobs, and Frontier's headquarters, to Wisconsin and Indiana, which offered greater tax and econonmic incentives. When legislators proposed eliminating <b>business</b> <b>tax</b> credits in late 2009 to help balance the states budget, Marostica publicly defended many of those credits, but he did support limited cuts to tax credits in Governor Ritter's proposed 2010–2011 budget.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post-war}} boom, {{the methods used}} to set up {{business}} in South Australia were unique. Playford's government would charge little to no <b>business</b> <b>tax,</b> supply cheap electricity, land and water, and have the Housing Trust build the factories and workers' homes. Consumer goods and automotive factories were created in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide; mining, steel and shipbuilding industries appeared in the 'Iron Triangle' towns of Whyalla, Port Pirie and Port Augusta. Prices and wages were kept relatively low to enable continued investment, and South Australia was slower than the other states to abolish these wartime measures to increase its industrial competitiveness. The government initiatives managed to overcome the large logistic burden, as Adelaide and South Australia were far from the markets where the goods would be sold.|$|E

Although he remained as majority shareholder, his sons controlled the daily operations of the conglomerate.|$|E

25|$|High {{population}} growth rate in Santa Maria triggers {{the expansion of}} commercial activities. The expansion is expected to answer the demand for product and services of the increasing populace. Commercial strips are being developed in strategic locations such as those where the concentration of population is located. Aside from Poblacion, commercial strips {{can be found in}} Barangay Bagbaguin where a major food chain, a major food market, three (3) restaurants, retail stores, and service establishments operate. Other barangays like Pulong Buhangin, Cay Pombo, Guyong, and Parada are also having a commercial strip. The increment in the number of registered businesses was attributed to the perceived effect of the campaign of the municipal government to register all businesses for efficient <b>business</b> <b>tax</b> collection.|$|E
25|$|Personal {{income tax}} is often {{collected}} on a pay-as-you-earn basis, with small corrections made {{soon after the}} end of the tax year. These corrections take one of two forms: payments to the government, for taxpayers who have not paid enough during the tax year; and tax refunds from the government for those who have overpaid. Income tax systems will often have deductions available that lessen the total tax liability by reducing total taxable income. They may allow losses from one type of income to be counted against another. For example, a loss on the stock market may be deducted against taxes paid on wages. Other tax systems may isolate the loss, such that business losses can only be deducted against <b>business</b> <b>tax</b> by carrying forward the loss to later tax years.|$|E
25|$|The city of Detroit {{and other}} private-public {{partnerships}} {{have attempted to}} catalyze the region's growth by facilitating the building and historical rehabilitation of residential high-rises in the downtown, creating a zone that offers many <b>business</b> <b>tax</b> incentives, creating recreational spaces such as the Detroit RiverWalk, Campus Martius Park, Dequindre Cut Greenway, and Green Alleys in Midtown. The city itself has cleared sections of land while retaining a number of historically significant vacant buildings in order to spur redevelopment; though it has struggled with finances, the city issued bonds in 2008 to provide funding for ongoing work to demolish blighted properties. Two years earlier, downtown reported $1.3billion in restorations and new developments which {{increased the number of}} construction jobs in the city. In the decade prior to 2006, downtown gained more than $15billion in new investment from private and public sectors.|$|E
