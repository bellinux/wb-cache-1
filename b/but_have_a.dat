5|$|Order Bdellonemertea. Includes seven species, {{of which}} six live as commensals in {{the mantle of}} large clams and one in that of a {{freshwater}} snail. The hosts filter feed and all the hosts steal food from them. These nemerteans have short, wide bodies and have no stylets <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sucking pharynx and a posterior stucker, with which they move like inchworms.|$|E
5|$|Skuas and jaegers are {{in general}} medium to large birds, {{typically}} with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings.

They are strong, acrobatic fliers.|$|E

5|$|The {{surnames}} Stewart and Stuart denote {{essentially the}} same occupation <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> completely different word derivation. They originate from the pre-7th-century English words stigweard—a compound of stig meaning household—and weard, a guardian.|$|E

Almost a hundred have been identified from the thousands of globular clusters in M87.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} of God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E

5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E
5|$|Cadets today {{live and}} work within the {{framework}} of the Cadet Leader Development System (CLDS), which specifies the roles that a cadet plays throughout their four years at the academy. Cadets begin their USMA careers as trainees (new cadets), then advance in rank, starting as CDT Privates (freshmen) and culminating as CDT Officers (seniors). Freshmen have no leadership responsibilities, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> host of duties to perform as they learn how to follow orders and operate in an environment of rigid rank structure, while seniors have significant leadership responsibilities and significantly more privileges that correspond to their rank.|$|E
5|$|Katy {{has been}} hired {{to take care of}} Hector and Tabitha's mansion while the two go out for the evening. They usually never leave the house, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rare event to attend. Tabitha greets Katy at the door and {{explains}} that the house is always kept at −3°C as Hector and Tabitha's disabled brother, Andras, needs the air to be at this temperature. The paintings on the house's walls depict the Harrowing of Hell. After meeting Hector, Katy is disturbed by Tabitha's descriptions of Andras, who, it is claimed, does not have a mouth. He instead keeps a bell, which he never uses, beside his bed. Katy is told not to go upstairs.|$|E

5|$|M. l. edouardi, like M. l. leucopterus, have {{black-and-white}} coloured males, and {{are found}} only on Barrow Island, also off the western coast of Australia. Birds of this subspecies {{are larger than}} those of M. l. leucopterus <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> shorter tail. The female has a more cinnamon tinge to her plumage than the grey-brown {{of the other two}} subspecies. It was described by A.J. Campbell in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Mushrooms {{produce a}} spore print with a color ranging from pinkish to salmon. Spores are elliptical, smooth, and measure 6.5–10 by 4.5–6.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 19–43 by 6–11μm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia that {{occur on the}} gill face) are usually spindle shaped, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> widely {{variable}} morphology; they are abundant in the hymenium, and have dimensions of 26–122 by 8–57μm. The cheilocystidia (on the gill edge) are similar in morphology and abundance, some may feature knobs held {{at the end of}} slender projections up to 20μm long; dimensions are in the range of 26 and 144μm long by 8–46μm wide. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae of V.bombycina.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the other}} {{discovered}} allotropes, carbon nanofoam is a ferromagnetic allotrope discovered in 1997. It {{consists of a}} low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web, in which the atoms are bonded trigonally in six- and seven-membered rings. It is among the lightest known solids, with a density of about 2kg/m. Similarly, glassy carbon contains {{a high proportion of}} closed porosity, but contrary to normal graphite, the graphitic layers are not stacked like pages in a book, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> more random arrangement. Linear acetylenic carbon has the chemical structure -(C:::C)-. Carbon in this modification is linear with sp orbital hybridization, and is a polymer with alternating single and triple bonds. This carbyne is of considerable interest to nanotechnology as its Young's modulus is forty times that of the hardest known material– diamond.|$|E
