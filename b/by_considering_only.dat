This is known as aspiration search. In the extreme case, the search is performed with alpha and beta equal; a technique known as zero-window search, null-window search, or scout search. This is particularly useful for win/loss searches {{near the end of}} a game where the extra depth gained from the narrow window and a simple win/loss evaluation function may lead to a conclusive result. If an aspiration search fails, it is straightforward to detect whether it failed high (high edge of window was too low) or low (lower edge of window was too high). This gives information about what window values might be useful in a re-search of the position.|$|E

2500|$|A {{relatively}} {{simple way to}} get a first-order approximation of delta-v is based on the 'Patched Conic Approximation' technique. One must choose the one dominant gravitating body in each region of space through which the trajectory will pass, and to model only that body's effects in that region. [...] For instance, on a trajectory from the Earth to Mars, one would begin <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> <b>only</b> the Earth's gravity until the trajectory reaches a distance where the Earth's gravity no longer dominates that of the Sun. [...] The spacecraft would be given escape velocity to send it on its way to interplanetary space. [...] Next, one would consider only the Sun's gravity until the trajectory reaches the neighbourhood of Mars. [...] During this stage, the transfer orbit model is appropriate. [...] Finally, only Mars's gravity is considered during the final portion of the trajectory where Mars's gravity dominates the spacecraft's behaviour. [...] The spacecraft would approach Mars on a hyperbolic orbit, and a final retrograde burn would slow the spacecraft enough to be captured by Mars.|$|E

40|$|A {{method to}} bound the {{steady-state}} solution of large Markov chains is presented. It integrates {{the concepts of}} eigenvector polyhedron and of aggregation and is iterative in nature. The bounds are obtained <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> a subset <b>only</b> of the system state space. This makes the method specially attractive for problems which are too large {{to be dealt with}} by traditional methods. The quality of the bounds depends on the locality of the system which is studied: when the system spends most of its time in a small subset of states, tight bounds can be obtained <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> this subset <b>only.</b> Finally, the bounds are refinable {{in the sense that the}} tightness of the bounds can be improved by enlarging the subset of states which is considered. The method is illustrated on a model of a repairable fault-tolerant system with 16 million states. Tight bounds on its availability are obtained <b>by</b> <b>considering</b> less than 0. 1 percent of its state space...|$|R
