500|$|Smith's {{had begun}} selling audio and {{photographic}} equipment and calculators {{at the end}} of the 1970s, with a modest degree of success. In 1980 its marketing development manager, John Rowland, hit upon the idea of creating [...] "Computer Know-How" [...] sections in major branches to sell computer books and magazines. Most of the items on display were imports from the United States but their relatively high cost reduced their attractiveness to the casual buyer. The commercial success and mass market potential of the ZX80 caught Rowland's interest; he approached Sinclair, saw a prototype ZX81 and agreed to market the machine through Smith's on an exclusive basis for the first six months after launch. As Rowland put it, [...] "what we've done now is bring the computer-orientated publications together with an actual computer, to create the Computer Know-How section of the store", alongside computer software and <b>blank</b> <b>cassette</b> tapes.

50|$|The first Nakamichi three-head decks {{were the}} 1000 and 700 {{introduced}} around 1973. The 1000 and 700 series decks had tape bias settings for normal bias (IEC TYPE I) and high bias (IEC TYPE II). Competitor cassette decks offered Ferri Chrome (IEC TYPE III) whereas Nakamichi {{chose not to}} do so. The settings for the normal and high bias were labeled as EX and SX respectively. Nakamichi also sold its own brand of <b>blank</b> <b>cassette</b> tapes.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} brands of {{cassettes}} at the time, which {{were made of}} more conventional formulations of plastic, Loran cassettes were exceptional in that the cassette's housing was made of Lexan thermoplastic, which has much more resistance to extreme heat. Lexan was chosen by Loran to provide a <b>blank</b> <b>cassette</b> that was more suited {{for use in the}} fluctuating temperatures of automotive environments, especially a car's interior during hot summer days, which could easily warp a conventional cassette's housing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blank</b> <b>cassettes</b> {{from the}} 70's-90's are {{unaffected}} because the hygroscopic binder {{was not used}} in cassette formulations.

50|$|Charles Pates' {{foray into}} mixtape {{curation}} began some “some years ago”, {{when he returned}} to the United Kingdom from New York City, where he had been working at a music magazine. Pates explains that, when visiting a friend surrounded by his collection of album's and singles” and was astounded by the music contained in the collection. The next day, he obtained a <b>blank</b> <b>cassette</b> tape and created his first mixtape. After this first tape, he continued making tapes and amassing his personal record collection from which to make tapes from. Eventually, he started making mixtapes for “dinner parties, gifts, nostalgia quiz nights” and they soon “ended up in restaurants, bars and public events”.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, Libyan ruler Muammar al-Gaddafi put out {{a decree}} {{inviting}} all young Tuareg men who were living illegally in Libya to receive full military training. Gaddafi dreamed of forming a Saharan regiment, {{made up of the}} best young Tuareg fighters, to further his territorial ambitions in Chad, Niger, and elsewhere. Ag Alhabib and his bandmates answered the call and received nine months of training. They answered a similar call in 1985, this time by leaders of the Tuareg rebel movement in Libya, and met fellow musicians Keddou Ag Ossade, Mohammed Ag Itlale (aka [...] "Japonais"), Sweiloum, Abouhadid, and Abdallah Ag Alhousseyni. All sang and played guitar in various permutations. The musicians joined together in a collective (now known as Tinariwen) in order to create songs about the issues facing the Tuareg people, built a makeshift studio, and vowed to record music for free for anyone who supplied a <b>blank</b> <b>cassette</b> tape. The resulting homemade cassettes were traded widely throughout the Sahara region.|$|E

In an effort to streamline operations, Brashs was split into Brashs, a company that sold audio systems, microwaves and compact discs, and Allans, which focused on musical instruments. Geoff Brash stepped down as executive Chairman in 1988 but stayed on as a director. By the 1990s, its product base expanded to selling Hi Fi stereos, video cassette recorders, microwaves and televisions. It also resumed selling white goods.|$|R

5000|$|John {{often used}} {{to tell the story}} behind [...] "Me and My Uncle." [...] Years ago he began {{receiving}} publishing royalties from a song on a Judy Collins record with which he was unfamiliar. It was titled [...] "Me and My Uncle". He called Judy to let her know of the mistake because he hadn't written any such song. She laughed and told him that about a year before, in Arizona after one of her concerts, they had a 'Tequila Night' back at the hotel with Stephen Stills, Neil Young, and a few others. They were running a <b>blank</b> <b>cassette</b> and John proceeded to write [...] "Me and My Uncle" [...] on the spot. The next day, John woke up to the tequila sunrise with no recollection of the songwriting incident. Judy kept the cassette from that evening and then, without informing John, recorded the song for her own record. Over the years the song was recorded by several people, and eventually became a standard of the Grateful Dead. John used to joke that, little by little, with each royalty check, the memory of writing the song would come back to him.|$|E
40|$|Rates {{of music}} piracy are {{notoriously}} high throughout China's audio-visual industries, with industry executives generally quoting piracy rates of between 75 % and 95 %. Disc piracy is common, particularly in wealthier cities along China's eastern seaboard. People living in less affluent or developed areas still use pirated audio cassettes, which are cheaper to copy than digital media. Cassette players, which {{are capable of}} both playing and copying music, are much more affordable to people living in poor areas of China than computers. They are also easier for less educated sectors of the population to use: they do not require computer literacy {{or the ability to}} romanize Chinese characters (pinyin). Expensive hardware investments are also unnecessary, allowing anyone with a tape recorder and a <b>blank</b> <b>cassette</b> to copy and share music using this format, regardless of their access to the Internet...|$|E

5000|$|In 2006 Shovlin created another {{exhibition}} {{based on}} the memorabilia of a non-existent German glam rock band called Lustfaust.

[...] The collection (once exposed) was runner-up for the Beck's Futures prize.

50|$|There {{are also}} some non-musical {{conceptual}} releases including Shaking Box Music: You Are the Noise Maker, which consists of 100 <b>blank</b> <b>cassettes</b> in a large metal box. This Is Shaking Box Music Part 2, which is a destroyed copy of the Mother Fellatio EP in a cassette case. Art Is Over consists of a single octopus tentacle housed in a cassette box. These non-music releases were typically released in even smaller quantities than the actual music releases, in quantities of 50 or less. Similar concepts are rampant throughout the band's catalogue, and often, the more ridiculous the theme or packaging of a release is, the more sought after it is by collectors. Copies of some Gerogerigegege records go for hundreds of dollars.|$|R
5000|$|Reviewing the {{exhibition}} Americans in Paris at London's National Gallery in 2006, he described James McNeill Whistler's Symphony in White No 1 as [...] "a clumsy bit of cake-making with thick smudges of white rubbed into the canvas in coarse, dry skid marks". [...] "Even Whistler's renowned mother manages here to underwhelm", he complained. Hoaxed by artist Jamie Shovlin, Januszczak {{later that year}} 'revealed' in his paper how the 1970s glam rock band Lustfaust had [...] "cocked a notorious snook at the music industry in the late 1970s by giving away their music on <b>blank</b> <b>cassettes</b> and getting their fans to design their own covers". The band had never existed outside Shovlin's fiction.

5000|$|Out of Focus was {{the first}} solo project of Hip-Hop rapper eLZhi, which has never been officially released.

These frequent recording sessions yielded that material that would form the [...] "Out Of Focus EP". As the project developed,eLZhi finalized a track list, commissioned a cover to be designed by Skinny Boy Graphics, and procured {{a large number of}} <b>blank</b> <b>cassettes</b> and cases. Everything seemed to be falling into place for the young artist but he abandoned the project at the last minute. The music, while recorded and roughly mixed, was never completed.

5000|$|The law {{explicitly}} allows to make private {{copies of}} copyrighted work without the author's consent for published works if the copy {{is not for}} commercial use.

5000|$|The {{government}} eventually {{attempted to}} ban raï, banning {{the importation of}} <b>blank</b> <b>cassettes</b> and confiscating the passports of raï musicians. This was done to prevent raï from not only spreading throughout the country, but {{to prevent it from}} spreading internationally and from coming in or out of Algeria. Though this limited the professional sales of raï, the music increased in popularity through the illicit sale and exchange of tapes. In 1985, Algerian Colonel Snoussi joined with French minister of culture Jack Lang to convince the Algerian state to accept raï. He succeeded in getting the government to return passports to raï musicians and to allow raï to be recorded and performed in Algeria, with government sponsorship, claiming it as a part of Algerian cultural heritage. This not only allowed the Algerian government to financially gain from producing and releasing raï, but it allowed them to monitor the music and prevent the publication of [...] "unclean" [...] music and dance and still use it to benefit the Algerian State's image in the national world. In 1986, the first state-sanctioned raï festival was held in Algeria, and a festival was also held in Bobigny, France.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the 1541 {{floppy disk}} drive was widespread. By contrast, in Europe, the C64 was often used with {{cassette}} tape drives (Datasette), which were much cheaper, but also much slower than floppy drives. The Datasette plugged into a proprietary edge connector on the Commodore 64's motherboard. Standard <b>blank</b> audio <b>cassettes</b> {{could be used in}} this drive. Data tapes could be write-protected {{in the same way as}} audio cassettes, by punching out a tab on the cassette's top edge.|$|R
50|$|Zimag (stylized as ZiMAG) was {{the name}} used by Magnetic Tape International to market {{consumer}} products, including video games and <b>blank</b> audio <b>cassettes,</b> VHS tapes, and floppy disks. Magnetic Tape International was a wholly owned subsidiary of Intermagnetic Corporation. The company released games for the Atari 2600 and Atari 8-bit computers in 1982 and 1983. The 2600 titles are games from Bit Corporation ported from PAL to NTSC and with different names. The Atari 8-bit computer titles were developed by Syncro, Inc.|$|R
2500|$|Most <b>cassettes</b> {{were sold}} <b>blank,</b> {{and used for}} {{recording}} (dubbing) the owner's records (as backup, {{to play in the}} car, or to make mixtape compilations), their friends' records, or music from the radio. This practice was condemned by the music industry with such alarmist slogans as [...] "Home Taping Is Killing Music". However, many claimed that the medium was ideal for spreading new music and would increase sales, and strongly defended their right to copy at least their own records onto tape. For a limited time in the early 1980s Island Records sold chromium dioxide [...] "One Plus One" [...] cassettes that had an album prerecorded {{on one side and the}} other was left blank for the purchaser to use, another early example being the 1980 [...] "C·30 C·60 C·90 Go" [...] cassingle by Bow Wow Wow where the b-side of the tape was blank, allowing the purchaser to record their own b-side. Cassettes were also a boon to people wishing to tape concerts (unauthorized or authorized) for sale or trade, a practice tacitly or overtly encouraged by many bands, such as the Grateful Dead, with a more counterculture bent. <b>Blank</b> <b>cassettes</b> also were an invaluable tool to spread the music of unsigned acts, especially within tape trading networks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cases that}} DCCs come in {{generally}} {{do not have the}} characteristic folding mechanism of those for analog compact cassettes. Instead, DCC cases tend to be simply plastic boxes that are open on one of the short sides. The front side has a hole that is almost the size of the cassette, so that any label on the cassette is exposed even when the cassette is in its case. This allows the user to slide the cassette {{into and out of the}} case with one hand, and it reduced production costs, especially for prerecorded cassettes, because a label is needed only for the cassette rather than for the case. Format partner Matsushita does, however, produce <b>blank</b> <b>cassettes</b> (under their Panasonic brand) with a clam-shell-style case. Because DCCs have no [...] "bulges" [...] near the tape access holes, there is more space in the case behind the cassette to insert, for example, a booklet for a prerecorded tape, or a folded up card on which users could write the contents of the tape. In spite of the differences, the outside measurements of the standard DCC cases are exactly identical to the cases of analog compact cassettes, so they can be used in existing storage systems. The Matsushita-designed clam-shell case is slightly thinner than an analog compact cassette case is.|$|R
25|$|The mass {{production}} of <b>blank</b> (recordable) Compact <b>Cassettes</b> began in 1964 in Hanover, Germany. Prerecorded music cassettes (also known as Music-Cassettes, and later just Musicassettes; M.C. for short) were launched in Europe in late 1965. The Mercury Record Company, a US affiliate of Philips, introduced M.C. to the US in July 1966. The initial offering consisted of 49 titles.|$|R
5000|$|Unofficial reconstructions of {{the album}} were often {{attempted}} by fans {{in order to give}} the recordings a cohesive listening structure, thus [...] "completing" [...] the album. For decades, fan-created playlists were the only way for the public to listen to an approximation of Smile as it would have been heard performed by the Beach Boys. The idea of personalized Smile tape mixes could be credited to Domenic Priore, whom within his 1988 book Look! Listen! Vibrate! Smile! encouraged readers with <b>blank</b> home-made <b>cassette</b> tapes to compile their own Smile album. Parks himself has since attributed Smile to be a [...] "pioneering event" [...] for interactive record design.|$|R
