After the inmates were given medical examinations—Hess refused his <b>body</b> <b>search,</b> and had to be held down—they were provided with prison garb and assigned the numbers by which they would be addressed throughout their stay. Hess was Number 7. The prison had a small library, and inmates were allowed to file special requests for additional reading material. Writing materials were limited; each inmate would be allowed four pieces of paper per month for letters. The prisoners were not allowed to speak to one another without permission and were expected to work in the facility, helping with cleaning and gardening chores. The inmates were taken for outdoor walks around the prison grounds for an hour each day, separated about [...] apart. Some of the rules became more relaxed as time went on.|$|E

500|$|A {{civil lawsuit}} was filed by Jordan Chandler {{and his parents}} on September 14, 1993. In late 1993, {{district}} attorneys in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties both convened grand juries to assess whether criminal charges should be filed against Jackson. By January 1, 1994, $2 million had been spent by prosecution departments in California and the grand juries had questioned 200 witnesses, but Jordan's allegations could not be corroborated. On January 4, 1994, Chandler's attorney, Larry Feldman, filed a motion for the photos from Jackson's December 1993 <b>body</b> <b>search</b> from investigators, saying Jackson's attorneys and the L.A. district attorney had refused to give him copies. A few weeks later, Feldman petitioned the court {{that he should be}} allowed access to Jackson's finances over concerns that the singer's wealth would give him an unfair advantage in court. One adviser to Jackson stated, [...] "You can take pictures of Michael's dick and he's not gonna like it, but once you start {{trying to figure out how}} much money he has, that's where he stops playing around." [...] Initially Jackson and his lawyers filed a motion for Superior Court Judge David M. Rothman to postpone the civil case until the criminal investigation was concluded. Feldman filed a counter-motion, saying the delay would hurt Jordan's chances for recovery and make it more difficult to gather evidence. It is legal to postpone a civil lawsuit past the criminal statute of limitations as a lawsuit can still be filed past that date, such as the case of Pacers, Inc. v. Superior Court. Also, the constitutional right to a [...] "speedy trial" [...] only applies to criminal cases according to the Sixth Amendment, not civil cases.|$|E

40|$|Almost {{fifty years}} ago, the United Nations set {{standards}} that reached international consensus and limited male correctional employees’ activities in female inmate residences. These restrictions were {{of particular importance}} to women prisoners. It is well documented that female prisoners who are particularly vulnerable, are traumatized by unwanted touching, assault, harassment, and invasion of their physical privacy and integrity. Despite this population’s history and international legal standards, {{there was a significant}} turn around in penology. The resulting cross-gender supervision for housing units and <b>body</b> <b>searches</b> became the norm in the United States. This article examines how the U. S. penal system transposed themselves form the benign protectors of modesty and dignity of female prisoners form the intrusions of male staff, to administering the present day correctional systems that generally permit cross-gender <b>body</b> <b>searches</b> and housing unit supervision in female prisons...|$|R
