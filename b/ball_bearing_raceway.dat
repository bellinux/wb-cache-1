40|$|The Metrology and Imaging {{modes of}} the {{acoustic}} reflection microscope {{are applied to}} spherically shaped specimens. Metrology is usually practiced by translating the specimen along the acoustic beam axis. This operation yields a measurement of the local Rayleigh velocity at a single location in the specimen plane. Imaging is accomplished through raster-scanning in the plane transverse to the beam axis. The two modes are, in effect, simultaneously employed when a nonplanar surface of 2 ̆ 7 known curvature is scanned. The resulting image reveals nearly concentric rings with radial, periodic brightness variation, if the surface is spherical in shape. Stainless steel <b>bearing</b> <b>balls</b> of the type used in gyros are used to demonstrate the technique.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a methodology {{to calculate the}} contact pressures on the rolling elements and other significant parameters applicable to <b>raceway</b> <b>bearings</b> used in aeronautical helicopter gearboxes. The mechanism is modelled by a hybrid method where the parts are decomposed in finite elements and the bearings are described by substitution features.

The Hertz contact theory is used to calculate the contact behaviour. The geometrical defects are included in the model thus changing the value of local displacements. Our paper shows the impact of the flexibility of the different mechanical parts and its geometrical defects, on the behaviour of the <b>bearing</b> <b>raceways.</b> Three most important conclusions are brought to the fore.
