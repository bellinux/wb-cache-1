30|$|In recent years, {{laparoscopy}} {{has become}} {{the gold standard for}} the treatment of ovarian endometriotic cysts [10, 11]. Laparoscopic stripping is the most preferred procedure [6]. Good haemostasis is important after laparoscopic stripping of the cyst wall, and techniques like <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulation,</b> sutures, fibrin sealants and direct pressure are used [8]. <b>Bipolar</b> <b>coagulation</b> of the ovarian stroma is effective but damages the healthy ovarian tissue. When the ovarian capsule is left open after <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulation,</b> it is associated with more adhesions as compared to the reconstruction of the ovary [12]. In contrast, sutures are useful but also cause additional damage to the healthy tissue [13]. Though suturing technique has been shown to cause less adhesions as compared to <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulation</b> by various studies, sutures cause more postoperative adhesions as seen in the myomectomy studies and suturing is technically more demanding [7, 14].

The present study aimed at investigating the extent of inflammatory and glial responses caused by different settings of <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulation</b> using an animal model. It also investigated whether and how pre-operative treatment with dexamethasone or progesterone, both known to have neuro-protective effects, would modulate gliosis and macrophage infiltration induced by <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulation.</b> The study consisted of two parts. The first part investigated the astrocytic and macrophage responses after <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulation</b> at different power settings. 45 Sprague-Dawley rats received craniotomy, followed by <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulation</b> at different power output settings (mock operation as control, 20 W and 40 W) over the rat cortex for a standardized duration of two seconds. On day 3, day 7 and day 28, brain sections were assessed by immunohistochemical staining for GFAP (astrocytes) and ED 1 (macrophages). Quantification of outcome by random field cell counting under light microscopy was performed. The second part of the study used another 45 male Sprague-Dawley rats, divided into three treatment groups: Group 1 received the vehicle agents only (Control); Group 2 received progesterone 20 mg/kg; Group 3 received dexamethasone 1 mg/kg. All treatments were given intraperitoneally two hours before craniotomy. The animals received <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulation</b> at 40 W for a standardized duration of two seconds. On day 1, 3 and 7, brain sections were assessed by immunohistochemical staining for GFAP and ED 1. Quantification of outcome by random field cell counting under light microscopy was performed.

The results showed that <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulation</b> was associated with significant glial and inflammatory responses that correlated with power output. Progesterone and dexamethasone were both effective in reducing the glial hypertrophy and macrophage infiltration associated with <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulation.</b> Dexamethasone had an additional advantage of reducing brain oedema and cavity formation.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionSpasticity can {{be defined}} as a velocity-dependent {{resistance}} to passive movement of a joint and its associated musculature. Functional neurosurgery should be considered when spasticity cannot be controlled by physical therapy and medications. ObjectiveThis study was done to evaluate the functional results of microsurgical DREZotomy (MDT) in a consecutive series of 15 paraplegic patients suffered from generalized spasticity of lower limbs. MethodsThis retrospective study included 15 paraplegic patients (10 due to spinal cord injury and 5 due to disseminated sclerosis) who underwent MDT for treatment of spasticity. The male to female ratio was 2 – 1 (10 males and 5 females) and their ages ranged from 22 to 56 years with mean age of 39 years. Assessment of spasticity was done using modified Ashworth scale and global functional score. All cases underwent MDT that consisted of a longitudinal incision of the dorsolateral sulcus, performed ventrolaterally at the entrance of the rootlets into the sulcus, followed by <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulations</b> performed inside the sulcus, down to the apex of the dorsal horn, continuously along all the spinal cord segments selected for surgery.

Assessment of outcome after surgery was done by comparing global functional score for spastic paraplegic patients before and after surgery. At the last follow up examination period, excellent results were obtained in 33. 3 % of patients, good results in 60 % of patients, and fair results in 6. 7 % of patients.

40|$|We {{wished to}} {{determine}} the optimal method for cord obliteration to perform selective reduction in complicated monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies under different clinical conditions. For this purpose, we reviewed our experience and the available published literature and unpublished reports. Indications were a cardiac twin pregnancy, twins discordant for fetal anomaly, and severe feto-fetal transfusion syndrome where one twin had a very poor prognosis. Data were available for the following techniques: cord embolization, fetoscopic cord ligation, laser coagulation, monopolar <b>coagulation</b> and <b>bipolar</b> cautery. Unfortunately the data are heterogeneous, incomplete and reports are only sporadic. Cord embolization using coils or sclerosants has a high failure rate and {{can no longer be}} recommended. In 23 published cases of fetoscopic cord ligation a failure rate of 10 % was reported. After successful ligation an overall fetal survival rate of 71 % but a risk of preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes (PPROM) of 30 % was documented. Four cases of monopolar coagulation have been published [...] all in a cardiac twin pregnancies. In three cases the abdominal aorta was coagulated prior to 20 weeks and complete cessation of flow was demonstrated. In 10 cases of <b>bipolar</b> cord <b>coagulation,</b> all procedures were technically successful. Nine of 10 were performed under ultrasound guidance through a single port. In 2 cases, frank PPROM occurred, leading to induction of labor. The other eight fetuses were born at 35 weeks or more. Nd:YAG coagulation of the cord was much more sporadically described; the success of the procedure seems to be clearly dependant on gestational age. In all our attempts prior to 20 weeks, we failed in only one out of 6 cases. In summary, there is little data to perform meaningful comparisons of available techniques for umbilical cord occlusion. Based on practical and technical considerations we use the following clinical algorithm: prior to 21 weeks, we attempt to coagulate the cord with Nd:YAG laser. If this is unsuccessful, or for gestations beyond 21 weeks, <b>bipolar</b> cord <b>coagulation</b> is currently our other method of choice.

30|$|Endometriotic cysts {{are among}} the most common ovarian cysts {{encountered}} during surgery [1]. Endometriomas can cause pelvic pain, infertility and dyspareunia, and the most preferred treatment is surgical [2]. Various laparoscopic techniques have been described for the treatment of ovarian endometriomas: cyst wall laser vaporization preceded or not by medical therapy, drainage and <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulation</b> of the cyst wall and stripping of the cyst wall [3 – 5]. Laparoscopic stripping is the preferred and safer technique [6]. After stripping of the cyst wall, bleeding from the ovarian wound is controlled by <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulation,</b> suturing, or tissue sealants [7, 8]. Each of these is associated with its own advantages and disadvantages.|$|E
30|$|Discussion: When {{removing}} an endometriotic ovarian cyst, {{an appropriate}} and careful surgical technique, {{without the use}} of the <b>bipolar</b> <b>coagulation</b> on ovarian tissue, does not determine a significant reduction of ovarian reserve evaluated by AMH serum dosage.|$|E
40|$|Monochorionic twin pregnancies (MC) are {{associated}} with a higher risk of complications than their bichorionic equivalents. When two fetuses share the same placenta, the two fetal circulations are closely bound by omnipresent vascular anastomoses. The determination of the chorionicity is essential for an adequate management of these particular pregnancies. The twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is one of the. possible complications and must be considered as an obstetrical emergency. Severe growth restriction of one twin occurs in 11 % of MC pregnancies. Before the limit of viability, in some of the cases, selective foeticide using particular methods are mandatory to preserve the wellbeing of the healthy twin. The invasive procedures carried out at the time these complications occur proved their effectiveness, under the condition of being applied by experienced experts. Laser coagulation, TTTS gold standard treatment, is associated with a fetal survival rate equal or higher than 75 %. Among MC twins, selective foeticide with <b>bipolar</b> cord <b>coagulation</b> allows an intact survival rate of the other twin in more than 75 to 80 % of the cases. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|Selective feticide in MC twins {{needs to}} be done with {{alternative}} techniques to potassium chloride injections because both fetal circulations are functionally one unit. This is achieved by surgical obliteration of both the arterial and venous flow, preferentially nearly simultaneous. Several techniques are available today. The largest experience is by ultrasound or sono-endoscopic guided <b>bipolar</b> cord <b>coagulation,</b> using forcepses of 2.4 or 3.0  mm, according to the cord size. Cord occlusion has a 78 – 84 % survival rate [31, 88]. Pre- and perinatal losses of the healthy twin are mainly due to cord entanglement because of iatrogenic rupture of the intertwin membrane or consequences of early PPROM also responsible for 7 % developmental problems in survivors. An effect of operator experience was demonstrated, showing decrease in PPROM and morbidity after 40 procedures [31]. Alternative energy sources such as laser, monopolar, or radiofrequency energy may be used through 14 – 18  G needles [89 – 91]. They work effectively in TRAP where low-flow conditions are present and all energy modalities show comparable outcomes [30, 92]. A special scenario is found in discordant monoamniotic pregnancies. Here, cord occlusion should be combined with subsequent cord transsection [39].|$|R

Among these methods, <b>bipolar</b> electrothermal <b>coagulation</b> carried out with the "LigaSure Bipolar Vessel Sealing System" has found numerous applications in some types of abdominal and pelvic surgery, especially when performed laparoscopically, where traditional methods of haemostasis sometimes prove more difficult to perform and are often unsafe. The authors also experimented with the use of electrothermal cautery in thyroid surgery, evaluating its efficacy in achieving haemostasis, as well as in reducing a number of complications such as hypoparathyroidism and recurrent palsy, which can be obtained utilizing the ability of the procedure to produce haemostasis without heat dispersion in the adjacent tissues. Analysing their experience with 67 cases of total thyroidectomy performed with the help of bipolar electrothermal cautery, the authors report a 4. 5 % incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism and a 1. 5 % incidence of transient monolateral recurrent lesions.

30|$|Uterine artery {{occlusion}} has {{the potential}} to compromise fibroid growth and its symptoms. There were only a few complications and adverse events associated with LUAO and UAE procedures. Both laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion and fibroid embolization are minimally invasive operating procedures that preserve the uterus and ovarian blood supply and allow achievement of pregnancy in women with symptomatic fibroids. At this time, there is insufficient information to predict the percentage of women who will able to become pregnant after uterine artery coagulation or embolization. It is very likely that the chance of pregnancy will depend on the extent of the fibroids and the quality of myometrial perfusion after previous uterine artery occlusion. Lichtinger et al.

Source Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Campus Bio Medico, University of Rome, Italy. r. angioli@unicampus. it Abstract STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of FloSeal, a 2 -component (collagen granules and thrombin) topical hemostatic agent for the control of minor bleeding of the ovarian wall {{at the end of the}} laparoscopic stripping procedure for endometriomas. DESIGN: Pilot study. SETTING: Tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic excision of endometriomas were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Eight patients was allocated to FloSeal group, whereas the remaining 12 patients were allocated to the control group. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the end of the laparoscopic stripping procedure for ovarian cyst (diameter between 3 and 6 cm), the ovarian cortex was carefully everted and thoroughly rinsed to identify the precise localization of bleeding spots. In the FloSeal group the sites of bleeding were covered with FloSeal under direct vision with a laparoscopic applicator. Gentle pressure on the ovary was applied for 5 minutes and subsequently bleeding sites were reexamined. In the control group hemostasis was obtained with conventional methods. Hemostasis was obtained in all cases by 3 minutes from FloSeal application in both study arms. The time of hemostasis was similar in control and FloSeal groups with a median time of 172 and 182 seconds, respectively. CONCLUSION: This preliminary series suggests that FloSeal may be used instead of <b>bipolar</b> electric <b>coagulation</b> after excision of ovarian endometriomas. Because the latter was identified by some authors as a possible cause of follicular damage, the use of FloSeal for bleeding control should be investigated in patients undergoing laparoscopic stripping of endometriomas.
