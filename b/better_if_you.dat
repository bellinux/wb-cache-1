500|$|He said of them: [...] "I {{think those}} songs weren't {{meant to be}} full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of [...] "Nothin' on You", it might've sounded like some '90s R."

500|$|Some UN {{aid workers}} {{immediately}} criticized the operation, arguing that very sick children were poorly served by programmes that obliged them to travel hundreds of miles.

When asked about the lyrical content of the record, Mars stated that [...] " [...] just [...] songs that [...] strongly believe in and that are coming from inside. There's no tricks. It's honesty with big melodies. And [...] singing the s*** out of them."

500|$|Asked {{to assess}} his {{personal}} performance {{after the loss}} to Kansas State, Colt McCoy said, [...] "I think I've had some bad luck, I'm definitely a better quarterback, definitely more experienced—I've just had some bad luck. Things that can go the wrong way, have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff." [...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many {{things we can do}} <b>better...</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown said {{he did not want to}} hear about bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're not going to have any excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E
500|$|It's <b>Better</b> <b>If</b> <b>You</b> Don't Understand is {{composed}} of four songs employing pop, pop rock, and hip hop genres. Mars explained that the EP is hard to classify since: [...] "I just write songs that I strongly believe in and that are coming from inside. There's no tricks. It's honesty with big melodies. And I'm singing the s*** out of them". Labeled as a [...] "romantic croon", the opening track, [...] "Somewhere in Brooklyn", was composed by The Smeezingtons. It features [...] "an emo-pop backing" [...] beat, a piano and synthesizers. Lyrically, the tune is about Mars chasing the [...] "perfect woman" [...] who got away, and wishing to find her again. The second release, [...] "The Other Side", features a vocal collaboration with Cee Lo Green and B.o.B., and is considered the best on the EP by some critics. The track {{has been described as}} incorporating 60's and 70's soulful feeling. Its instrumentation uses guitar, organ and a: [...] "drum and bass pace that slowly builds through the verse and into the chorus". It is reminiscent of compositions by Daniel Merriweather and Chris Isaak’s [...] "Wicked Game". [...] "The Other Side" [...] shows Mars' darker side has a [...] "soaring pop" [...] hook.|$|E

500|$|... "Count On Me" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. Pete Rivas of The AU Review gave [...] "Count On Me" [...] a 7 out of 10 {{saying that it}} is an [...] "uplifting and chilled sounds" [...] and that it [...] "hits all the right spots". Rivas found the lyrics to convey a [...] "nice" [...] and [...] "positive" [...] message, adding that the single [...] "shows some similarities with his other singles but not to much detriment". The Boston Globe critic Ken Capobianco exalted Mars's vocals on the recording as [...] "one of his best" [...] on the album. MTV UK Joanne Dorken and Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine said that the recording's sound was [...] "reminiscent" [...] of [...] "Over The Rainbow" [...] by Israel Kamakawiwoʻole.

He added, that the song is [...] "perfect for summer days". However, while reviewing the parent album, Tim Sendra from AllMusic found that the song lack deepness and [...] "it’s not poetry". However, Sendra did say that the track is [...] "sweetly played and sung" [...] and is able to [...] "project a cuddly image and will melt hearts".|$|E
500|$|Writing in the {{academic}} journal Rhizomes, scholar Martin Hall, while analyzing the movie, discusses the self-perception an individual develops based on the views of those outside of themselves. The academician notes that when a child first comprehends the function of a mirror, they begin to develop the understanding that their perception of themselves is not self-contained, and learn partly they are what they see in the mirror. He contrasts this to when Anderton discovers the precogs' vision of his future self. At {{the beginning of the}} film, Anderton shows little concern for the precogs; when Witwer feels pity for them, he responds: [...] "It's <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't think of them as human." [...] Shortly thereafter, however, Anderton is shown in tears at his home, high on the hard drug neuroin while mourning the loss of his son. Agatha enters a similar period of self-examination when she has visions of her mother's death, and is informed they are merely [...] "echoes" [...] i.e. a faulty image in her memory. Anderton becomes flustered when he begins to interpret the images which show him about to commit murder and begins to frantically sort through, According to Hall he begins [...] "searching for whatever possible versions of this representation are available to him, other than the one that represents him as a murderer." [...] Hall says that he is sorting through the images so feverishly, as he is convinced once they are sorted properly and understood, they will not show him to be the murderer, because he is convinced that he is not a murderer. He literally becomes obsessed with himself, seeking to resolve these images with put him at [...] "discordance with his own reality." [...] Previously, at peace with himself, Hall says Anderton cannot accept the image he sees in the precogs' visions. Unable to reconcile the two, Hall says that he is forced to decide that [...] "it is likely that errors have occurred" [...] in the PreCrime system.|$|E
