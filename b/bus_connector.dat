The station is located about two miles (3km) west of the MacArthur BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) Station in Oakland. To supplement the bus service provided by AC Transit, the local transit agency, the city runs a free shuttle service called Emery Go Round that serves MacArthur BART, the Amtrak station, the Bay Street shops, the Watergate condominium complex and nearby marina, and other locations throughout the city and into Berkeley.|$|E

This allowed the owner to use any of the myriad of available S-100 bus on the market. In 1982 the Level B upgrade sold for $49.95, and $4.85 for each S-100 <b>bus</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A PMC {{can have}} up to four 64-pin bus connectors. The first two ("P1" [...] and [...] "P2") are used for 32 bit PCI signals, a third ("P3") is needed for 64 bit PCI signals.

50|$|PCIe/104 {{is similar}} to the PCI/104-Express standard, but omits the legacy PCI bus to {{increase}} available space on the board (similar to the relationship between PC/104-Plus and PCI-104). The PCI Express connector location and pinout options the same as PCI/104-Express (both Type 1 and Type 2). Because the PCI <b>bus</b> <b>connector</b> is omitted, a PCIe/104 board is incompatible with PC/104-Plus and PCI-104 systems (unless a PCIe-to-PCI bridge device is used).|$|E

50|$|The system <b>bus</b> <b>connector</b> {{was based}} on the K1520 {{standard}} for 8-bit computers in the GDR. This conformity to one standard across computers, ranging from tank-sized mini computers to small home computers, allowed the reuse of hardware from minicomputers with the same bus interface. This meant that most of the hardware and binary code from one platform could be used across very different platforms and allowed the sharing of resources.|$|E
50|$|Because the PCIe <b>bus</b> <b>connector</b> is surface-mount, not through-hole, {{it is also}} {{possible}} for a board to use different bus pinouts on the top side of the board vs the bottom side. For example, a CPU board may have a Type 1 bottom PCIe connector and a Type 2 top PCIe connector. Such a CPU board would be compatible with Type 1 and/or Universal peripherals on the bottom, and compatible with Type 2 and/or Universal peripherals on the top.|$|E
50|$|In the mid 1980s the STEbus {{standard}} addressed {{these issues}} by specifying what is {{rather like a}} VMEbus simplified for 8-bit processors. The bus signals are sufficiently generic {{so that they are}} easy for 8-bit processors to interface with. The board size was usually a single-height Eurocard (100 mm x 160 mm) but allowed for double-height boards (233 x 160 mm) as well.The latter positioned the <b>bus</b> <b>connector</b> so that it could neatly merge into VME-bus systems.|$|E
50|$|Introduced and {{included}} with the Macintosh Plus in 1986, it was an extended keyboard that had a built-in numeric keypad. In 1987 it was updated to Apple's new Platinum gray color. It continued to use the telephone-cord style connector to the system and was interchangeable with the M0110. Though Apple switched all other keyboards to Apple Desktop <b>Bus</b> <b>connectors</b> by this time, this keyboard was manufactured unchanged for four more years until the Plus was discontinued in 1990.|$|R

50|$|In March 1976, Intel {{announced}} a single-board computer product that integrated {{all of the}} support components required for their 8080 microprocessor, along with 1 kilobyte of RAM, 4 kilobytes of user-programmable ROM, and 48 lines of parallel digital I/O with line drivers. The board also offered expansion through a <b>bus</b> <b>connector,</b> but could be used without an expansion card cage when applications did not require additional hardware. Software development for this system was hosted on Intel's Intellec MDS microcomputer development system; this provided assembler and PL/M support, and permitted in-circuit emulation for debugging.|$|E
50|$|Level C was a {{card cage}} and S-100 bus {{expander}} card. This card would plug {{into one of}} the S-100 bus sockets on the motherboard. You could then plug up to five more S-100 bus cards into the expander card. One of the two original slots on the motherboard was still available for use, giving the Level C Explorer 85 a capacity of six S-100 bus cards. The card cage held all of the cards in place. In 1982 the Level C upgrade sold for $39.95, and $4.85 for each S-100 <b>bus</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|E
50|$|PICMG 2.30 {{gives the}} J2 pins a fixed {{interface}} functionality. This makes 64-bit bus communication impossible.The new J2 connector type itself is 100% {{compatible with the}} legacy one. The J1 <b>bus</b> <b>connector</b> conforms with the CompactPCI definition.In all, CompactPCI PlusIO is 100% compatible with legacy 32-bit CompactPCI in 3U and 6U format (single and double Eurocards). At the same time, its serial rear I/O connectivity and higher-speed connector form a bridge towards future CompactPCI Serial system architecture. Hybrid backplanes support several cards of the three different standards PICMG 2.0, 2.30, and CPCI-S.0.|$|E

50|$|Even if {{only one}} non-terminated coupler acts as the bus because all devices (bus controller, remote terminals, etc.) are {{connected}} to the couplers stubs, the external bus connections of the coupler must be terminated. A dual-terminated coupler (with or without non-functional <b>bus</b> <b>connectors)</b> can be employed where the coupler acts as the bus without other couplers. RFI dust caps (with or without safety chains) are recommended for all unused stub ports. Data bus couplers are readily available in 2 through 8 stubs and in various sizes and shapes of boxes and slim inline models. Also a variety of connectors are offered with couplers.|$|R
5000|$|One unusual {{peripheral}} offered was a [...] "Quick Printer", an electrostatic rotary printer that {{scanned the}} video memory {{through the same}} <b>bus</b> <b>connector</b> used for the expansion interface, and printed {{an image of the}} screen onto aluminum-coated paper in about a second. Unfortunately, it was incompatible with both the final, buffered version of the expansion interface, and with the [...] "heartbeat" [...] interrupt used for the real-time clock under Disk BASIC. This could be overcome by using special cabling, and by doing a [...] "dummy" [...] write to the cassette port while triggering the printer.|$|E
50|$|A {{proposed}} bus {{rapid transit}} system using the new bridge was shelved as too expensive. However, the bridge was structurally built for expansion of the BRT {{at a later date}} in mind. Also the new bridge is built to consider a later date expansion which would include a commuter rail. The existing Tarrytown station of the Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line is located about 2000 ft from the new bridge's eastern landing. In 2011, the state estimated that a <b>bus</b> <b>connector</b> to the station would add about $151 million, or about 3 percent to projected costs of the new bridge.|$|E
5000|$|The ZX Printer {{was also}} {{compatible}} with the earlier ZX80 computer (when fitted with the 8kB ROM upgrade) and the later ZX Spectrum, and plugged directly into the expansion <b>bus</b> <b>connector</b> via a short cable. The expansion bus was duplicated {{on the outside of}} the printer's connector, allowing other peripherals to be connected concurrently. The printer drew its power directly from the expansion bus, and was sold with a larger (1-2A) power supply for the ZX81 to accommodate the additional power drain. [...] The Spectrum's user manual noted that this was not needed for the Spectrum as its default 1.1A power supply was sufficient.|$|E
50|$|The {{specifications}} {{released by}} the PC/104 Consortium define multiple of Bus Structures (ISA, PCI, PCI Express) and Form Factors (104, EBX, EPIC). Bus Structure defines the location and pinout of the <b>bus</b> <b>connector(s).</b> Form Factor refers to {{size and shape of}} the board. It is possible to find one of the PC/104 stackable expansion buses on a number of different form factors. While most commercially available products using the Bus Structures will comply with the Form Factors listed below, it is possible for a non-standard or proprietary form factor to incorporate one of the PC/104 Bus Structures for expandability.|$|R
5000|$|A casual {{glance at}} a USB [...] "Type A" [...] plug {{connector}} may give the false {{impression that it}} is hermaphroditic. However, a physical attempt to mate two USB [...] "Type A" [...] cables with each other reveals {{the fact that the}} connectors will not interconnect. Classifying according to mathematical graph theory, USB buses are directed trees, whereas FireWire buses have a true bus network topology. This difference is reflected in the <b>bus</b> <b>connectors</b> used, in that USB cables are asymmetrical (one end Type A, other end Type B) while FireWire cables may have identical connectors at both ends.|$|R
