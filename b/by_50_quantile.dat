30|$|Results {{showed that}} the attitudes of gender {{ideology}} for married Chinese parents mainly fall between “disagree” and “agree.” The composite score averaged from the five questions on gender ideology has a mean value of 2.81 and {{a standard deviation of}} 0.67. The vast majority of married Chinese parents tend to cluster around the vicinity of 3, and only a minor proportion responded in the vicinity of 1 and 5. The 25, <b>50,</b> and 75 <b>quantiles</b> were 2.4, 2.8, and 3.4, respectively. The <b>50</b> <b>quantile</b> (or median) was 2.8, in between “disagree” and “neither agree nor disagree.” This means that half of married Chinese parents identifies with traditional gender ideology less than 2.8. The mean and median of the overall gender ideology score are slightly less than 3, indicating that married Chinese parents slightly disagree with the traditional gender ideology.|$|R
40|$|While Asians are overrepresented {{in science}} and engineering, they receive limited {{scholarly}} attention in sociology of science. To fill the knowledge gap about this understudied group, this study examines the effects of race, nativity, degree origin, gender, field, employment sector, and nationality on the earnings of Asian computer scientists and engineers working in the U. S. Data are derived from the National Survey of College Graduates, 1993 and 2003. Using quantile regression, this study has the following findings. First, race and nativity had some effects on the earnings of Asian computer scientists and engineers in 1993 at both 90 th and <b>50</b> th <b>quantiles,</b> but they disappeared in 2003 with one exception. Degree origin had an effect in 1993 in some cases at the 90 th quantile but across gender, field, and two sectors at the <b>50</b> th <b>quantile.</b> However, it disappeared in 2003 with two exceptions. Second, all the four women's groups [...] white, Asian American, U. S. -, and Asian-educated immigrant women [...] earned less {{than their male counterparts}} in 1993 or 2003 at either quantile. Furthermore, U. S. -educated immigrant women suffered from the double bind effect, or being disadvantaged due to both their gender and race, at the <b>50</b> th <b>quantile.</b> Third, computer scientists earned slightly more than their engineer counterparts in both years at both quantiles. Fourth, educational institutions and state/local government paid less than industry in 1993 and 2003 at both quantiles. Federal government eliminated the gap in 2003 at the <b>50</b> th <b>quantile.</b> Finally, this study finds that a few but not all nationality groups suffered from earning disadvantages in 1993 or 2003 at either quantile. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the earnings of workers in the upper tail (90 th quantile) are less influenced by factors that this study examines than those at the median (<b>50</b> th <b>quantile).</b> Overall, the findings partly reaffirm the structural barriers that some groups, notably women, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants, face in the U. S. workplace. The degree origin effect in 1993 could be due to the lower quality of degrees from Asia. The disappearance of such an effect in 2003 could be due to the interactions between structural forces and human capital. Ph. D.
