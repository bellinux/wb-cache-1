Consequently, very {{little research has been}} published regarding this dialect. It has been generally influenced by Vietnamese for three centuries and accordingly displays a pronounced accent, tendency toward monosyllablic words and lexical differences from Standard Khmer.|$|E

The major mechanisms known or hypothesized are described in turn below.|$|E
