Purpose: {{revealing}} of the physico-chemical {{peculiarities of}} converter processes with various <b>blast</b> <b>supply</b> and {{association of the}} acoustic characteristic with them; development of the control methods {{with regard to the}} acoustic characteristic. With various types of the blow, the acoustic signal is associated with the converter bath processes including those in the infra-sound range. The break-down phenomenon during the combination blow is studied. The expression for calculating the bottom zone length is defined more precisely. The rational acoustic control frequency range is determined and process prediction and control methods are determined for various <b>blast</b> <b>supply.</b> These methods make it possible to increase the production of good-quality metal and to enhance its quality.

40|$|Two {{types of}} the systems {{providing}} groups of blast-furnaces with blast through one or two common manifolds were analyzed in the article. The first system consists of four turbo-superchargers, working in parallel for one common manifold and four <b>blast</b> furnaces <b>supplied</b> with <b>blast</b> from that manifold. A differential equation was found for such a system, describing pressure alterations inside the manifold, due to parameters of the blast consumed by the furnaces and due to the operation of turbo-superchargers working in parallel for that manifold. The second system of <b>blast</b> <b>supply</b> has {{the same number of}} turbo-superchargers and blast-furnaces, but has two common manifolds, connected by a pipeline. A mathematical description of this work as a system of two differential equations, describing the dependence of the blast pressure upon the parameters of turbo-superchargers and the mode of blast-furnaces operation was developed. The obtained differential equations are differential equations with random coefficients. Then it was shown that by replacing these random coefficients with their average values and analyzing the set systems operation mode afterwards {{it will be possible to}} evaluate the parameters of the turbo-superchargers, that will make it possible to provide the blast furnaces with blast with preset parameters.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} two methods of control over hot <b>blast</b> <b>supply</b> into a <b>blast</b> furnace with constant pressure and constant amount (consumption). The analysis of these two methods was performed {{with the aim of}} determining their influence upon changes in gas pressure in the blast furnace top. The blast furnace was considered as a unity of vessels (furnace hearth, the top) and gas-dynamic resistance (a column of charge materials). A differential equation was obtained, with regard to the dynamic balance of gas flow at the inlet and outlet of the top; the equation relates the pressure and gas consumption at the top to the pressure and hot blast consumption at the inlet and outlet of the furnace and to the resistance of the column of charge materials. The column of charge materials is considered as n-th number of channels through which gas flow inside the furnace moves and which resist to the flow. By the analysis of this equation at steady state (automatic stabilization of gas pressure in the top), the conditions were obtained to be satisfied with the specified value of gas pressure in the top. This value is equal to a half of the sum of the value of hot blast pressure at the inlet into the furnace and the value of pressure inside the collector of blast furnace gas. This conclusion is verified by the operation practice of blast furnaces in Ukraine. While analyzing the second method of controlling the <b>supply</b> of <b>blast</b> supply-stabilization of consumption (amount) of hot <b>blast</b> <b>supplied</b> into the furnace {{it has been shown that}} the method could be realized in condition of stabilization of the amount of blast furnace gas, going out of the furnace. As the resistance of the column of charge materials constantly changes it is necessary to change the hot blast pressure in order to ensure the constant amount of <b>blast,</b> <b>supplied</b> into the furnace. It is often connected with possible substantial pressure fluctuations of hot blast at the inlet of the furnace, which may result in stoppages in the motion of the column of charge materials. Due to it the hot blast pressure stabilization at the inlet of the furnace and the pressure stabilization in the top seem to be the most rational way to control the blast suppl...|$|R

40|$|Surface waves play a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} propagation of vibrations caused by blasting. Indeed, active and passive surface wave tests, which are widely used techniques in engineering and geophysical exploration to infer model parameters for soils and rocks, can be profitably applied for the prediction of ground motion from <b>blasting</b> <b>supplying</b> relevant information on subsurface mechanical properties and source parameters (patterns of propagation and dominant wavelengths). In this respect, monitoring systems for ground vibrations can be conceived in order to use the collected data also for ground characterization purposes. Moreover, the interpretation of surface wave data can lead to an estimate of shear modulus and damping ratio (quality factor) as a function of depth. This information can be used to build a numerical model to simulate wave propagation and predict ground vibrations evaluating the performances of vibration mitigation systems. For preliminary assessments of ground vibrations induced by blasting, the information from surface wave tests can be used to improve the predictive capability of attenuation relationships. In particular in the present work reference is made to a recently proposed relationship based on energy spreading in the form of Rayleigh wave propagation.

It was demonstrated in 1961 but 5 gallons of hydrogen peroxide as fuel for 21 seconds of flight time did not impress the army and development was cancelled. This concept was revived in the 1990s and today these packs can provide powerful, manageable thrust. This rocket belt's propulsion works with superheated water vapour. A gas cylinder contains nitrogen gas, and two cylinders containing highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide. The nitrogen presses the hydrogen peroxide onto a catalyst, which decomposes the hydrogen peroxide into a mixture of superheated steam and oxygen with a temperature of about 740 °C. This was led by two insulated curved tubes to two nozzles where it <b>blasted</b> out, <b>supplying</b> the propulsion.

40|$|An {{issue of}} {{improvement}} {{of the effectiveness of}} the operation of a block of hot blast stoves of the blast furnace in order to rise the temperature of the blast-furnace air was considered. It was shown that an increase of the temperature of the blast-furnace air without the use of natural gas and oxygen for combustion is possible due to the changing of the operation modes of a block of hot blast stoves and at the increase of the pressure of the exchange gas. An analysis of the recent researches and publications describing the methods for determining the parameters of the operation of the block of hot blast stoves of the blast furnace was performed; their advantages and disadvantages were described. The goal of the research was set. A database of process parameters of the block was processed to determine the main characteristics of the operation of hot blast stoves of the blast furnace. Averaged values of the basic technical and design parameters were obtained; they characterize the operation of each hot blast stove of the block with the use of which the adjustment of a mathematical model of the operation of each of hot blast stove of the block was achieved. A method for determining the main unit operating parameters on the block on the account of the desired blast temperature was designed. The values of the duration of the cycle "heating + air blasting" depending on the set-point temperature of the smoke at various values of air blasting temperatures were determined for each hot blast stove of the block using a mathematical model. The authors suggested to use such dependencies to determine the temporal parameters of the operation of the block of hot blast stoves. The obtained values of the duration of heating periods and air blasting of each hot blast stove of the block should be corrected if the continuity of the air <b>blast</b> <b>supply</b> to the <b>blast</b> furnace is not ensured.

Recommendations that employers can take include making a commitment to prevent silicosis at the worksite. This involves complying with OSHA and MSHA regulations regarding silica exposure, performing air monitoring at the worksite, maintaining engineering controls, substituting less hazardous materials for silica for abrasive <b>blasting</b> operations, and <b>supplying</b> vacuums with high efficiency particulate air filters.

40|$|According to the Convention on Biological Diversity, Biodiversity is “the {{variability}} among {{living organisms}} from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes {{of which they}} are part; this includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems”. Antarctica is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent. The temperature can reach - 30 °C, the precipitation is only 5 - 20 g/cm 2 /year and the highest recorded wind velocity is 327 km/h. It has the highest average elevation of all the continents, and about 98 % of its surface, 14 million km 2, is covered by ice. In these extreme conditions, only cold-adapted organisms survive, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. The Antarctic continent has been frequently cited as a pristine place, with a rather limited diversity of plants and animals, but with highly diverse microbial community. In this work we studied the bacterial community obtained from sea water and rock samples collected in Antarctica. The study has been carried out both on cultivable strains, isolated by traditional methods, and on the total bacterial community by molecular methods. The isolates were investigated in order to understand their temperature and salinity preferences. Furthermore, a detailed taxonomical study was carried out both on cultivable and total bacterial population. Study about bacterial isolates  Strain isolation and preliminary tests Isolates derived from two different typology samples: sea water (BA) and rock (BAR). Sea water was sampled in various areas of Ross sea at different distances from the coast: Faraglione (300 m), Santa Maria Novella (2. 5 Km), Portofino (1 Km), Thetys Bay (0 m). The rocks samples were sampled according to a longitudinal and altitudinal transect at increasing distance from the sea in 57 different places. Moreover for each sample place were considered different sites. Rocks were fragmented and strewed on PCA plates and water was filtered on membranes in order to obtain both bacteria pure cultures and DNA for the molecular investigations. Pure cultures of the isolates were obtained by plate streak method. Preliminary tests were carried out considering strain morphological characteristics (shape, color and dimensions), Gram reaction and simple biochemical tests (catalase and oxidase production). This preliminary selection permitted to remove the majority of replicates. A total of 100 isolates were obtained.  Taxonomical identification of the isolates Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from pure cultures and used for the amplification of 16 S rDNA to allow taxonomical identification of each isolate. The strains were affiliates to the genera: Microbacterium, Psychrobacter, Diezia, Marisediminicola, Bacillus, Sporosarcina, Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, Deinococcus, Brevundimonas, Frondihabitans, Rhodococcus, Agrococcus, Auraticoccus, Kocuria. Only 54 % of the strains were identified to species level and the remaining were identified only to the genus level. In some cases <b>Blast</b> analyses <b>supplied</b> uncertain identification, sequences were aligned with highly similar 16 S in the NCBI Genbank and phylogenetic analysis was performed. Three phylogenetic trees were created for the most important and representative groups: Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Psychrobacter. A phylogenetic tree was constructed for all minor groups.  Growth profiles at different Temperature and salinity The optimal temperatures for growth of the various strains were tested in the range 0 - 45 °C on PCA plates (steps of 5 °C). The majority (88 %) of BA strains were able to grow in a wide temperature range. The 82 % of BA were psycrotolerant, 9 % were mesophilic- psychrotolerant and 9 % strictly psychrophilic because they had the optima at 5 °C and 10 °C. All BAR strains grew in a wide temperature range. 96 % of BAR were psycrotolerant and only 4 % were mesophilic- psychrotolerant. The optimal salinity for growth were tested in the range 0 - 100 g/L on PCA plates containing different concentration of NaCl salt (steps of 5 g/L). 35 % of BA strains were no halophilic, 34 % were halotollerant and 31 % were slightly halophilic. 65 % of BAR strains were no halophilic, 26 % slightly halophilic and 9 % were halotollerant. Study of total bacterial community In order to have a complete overview of the bacterial community structure, by a cultivation-independent approach, total DNA was extracted from the filter-membranes and rocks samples. The bacteria biodiversity was studied by PCR-DGGE fingerprinting. The genetic target used was the hypervariable region V 3 of the 16 S rDNA. DGGE gel images allow the analysis of band patterns generated from the environmental samples representing the various species present in the community. A single species is identified by a single band and the relative abundance of a single species is determined by band intensity.  Bacterial community in the sea water samples DGGE analysis was conducted for the bacterial communities present in marine samples from four different sites in the Ross Sea and sampled in three different times. To evaluate the structure of the bacterial community and perform a clustering analysis of the various DGGE profiles two software were used: Quantity One 1 -D and Phoretix 1 -D. Pearson and Dice dendrograms reflect the high heterogeneity of the sea samples and there was not a clear correlation between either in terms of sites, nor according to the time of sampling. Some bands were excised from the gel, re-amplified, sequenced and compared with NCBI GenBank database sequences. A phylogenetic tree was built to understand the relationships between the sequences. The comparison in the database shows that 67 % of the identified sequences were close to unclassified species or uncultured bacteria. 155 bands were observed and the band intensity was calculate for all lanes (profiles) to have information on the relative abundance of species. The biodiversity and richness was estimated with 8 indices: Richness (n°), Weighted Richness (Rr), Stability index, Margalef index, Pielou’s evenness index, functional organization (Fo), Simpson and Shannon index. The correlation of 3 environmental variables: temperature, distance from the coast, presence/absence of ice, with the structure of the microbial communities was observed by NMDS analysis (not metric Multi Dimensional Scaling). In a two-dimensional plot the sea water samples were divided in 3 groups: α, β, γ. The temperature seems to be positively correlated to the group γ and negatively correlated to the α and β groups. While, the variables presence/absence of ice and distance from the coast were positively correlated with the α, β groups and negatively correlated to the γ groups.  Bacterial community in the rock samples The endolithic bacterial community present in rocks samples collected in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of, Victoria Land, was analyzed by the PCR-DGGE technique. The work was divided in two parts: - A first analysis had allowed the study of the total bacterial communities present in 70 samples collected in 57 Victoria Lands sites. For same sites were present more rocks of different types. - A second analysis allowed to investigate how the bacterial biodiversity changes in the micro and macro rock environment. Three sites were analyzed: Richard Nunatak, Vegetation Island and Mt. Howard. For each site were tested two roks samples, both individually and combined together. In addition, from one of the two rocks were derived three sub samples, identified as A, B, C.  Total rocks samples The structure of bacterial endolithic communities was studied by a cluster analysis with two software: Quantity One 1 -D and Phoretix 1 -D. Dice and Pearson coefficients described a strong heterogeneity among the rock samples. In addition, in the dendrograms no correlation was observed between distribution of the samples and their sampling sites. 61 bands were excised from the gel, re-amplified, sequenced and compared with NCBI GenBank database sequences. The phylogenetic analysis showed that 84 % of the sequences presented no similarity with the species and/or genera known. In particular, 46 % were related to sequences deposited in the data bank as “Uncultured bacterium”, 25 % had similarity with sequences of know genera but a unknow species and 13 % showed no similarity with deposited sequences. The biodiversity and richness indices were calculated to describe the bacterial endolithic communities. All rock samples were characterized by high values of biodiversity and richness. The results showed that biodiversity and richness were not affected by position and type of the rock. All samples showed a high heterogeneity. NMDS analysis was done to understand how five variables: altitude, distance from the sea, type of colonization, porosity and type of rock, influenced the biodiversity and richness of rock samples. In the two-dimensional plot each sample appeared to be influenced differently by the five variables and a common relationship was not observed. The results described an environment in which many variables and theit combination determined the biodiversity and richness of community. Each sample is affected differently by the variables and it was not clear how the variables influenced the endolithic bacterial distribution.  Micro and macro rock habitat The micro habitats present inside the rock are influenced by numerous factors: position and orientation of rocks, altitude, permanence of the snow cover. These are significant aspects in the selection of the microorganisms and the position and portion in which the microrganism will begin colonization. This means that within the rock numerous micro habitats are present. These have different characteristics and will influence the development the type of the microbial community.
