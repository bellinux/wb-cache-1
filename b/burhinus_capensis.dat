50|$|The spotted thick-knee (<b>Burhinus</b> <b>capensis)</b> {{also known}} as the spotted dikkop or Cape thick-knee, is a wader in the family Burhinidae. It is native to {{tropical}} regions of central and southern Africa.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{attempts}} to reconcile differences between widely separated regions, traditions and languages, by arbitrarily imposing nomenclature, often reflect narrow perspectives and have unfortunate outcomes. For example, {{members of the}} genus Burhinus occur in Australia, Southern Africa, Eurasia, and South America. A recent trend in field manuals and bird lists {{is to use the}} name [...] "thick-knee" [...] for members of the genus. This, {{in spite of the fact}} that the majority of the species occur in non-English-speaking regions and have various common names, not always English. For example, [...] "Dikkop" [...] is the centuries-old South African vernacular name for their two local species: <b>Burhinus</b> <b>capensis</b> is the Cape dikkop (or [...] "gewone dikkop", not to mention the presumably much older Zulu name [...] "umBangaqhwa"); Burhinus vermiculatus is the [...] "water dikkop". The thick joints in question are not even in fact the birds’ knees, but the intertarsal joints—in lay terms the ankles. Furthermore, not all species in the genus have “thick knees”, so the thickness of the [...] "knees" [...] of some species is not of clearly descriptive significance. The family Burhinidae has members that have various common names even in English, including “stone curlews”, so the choice of the name “thick-knees” is not easy to defend, but is a clear illustration of the hazards of facile coinage of terminology.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{preference}} for ground-dwelling avian prey, a surprisingly {{considerable number of}} water birds may also be attacked. Waterfowl known to be attacked include the 1.18 kg South African shelduck (Tadorna cana), 1 kg yellow-billed duck (Anas undulata), the 4.43 kg spur-winged goose (Plectropterus gambensis) (Africa’s largest waterfowl species) and especially the peculiar, overly bold and aggressive 1.76 kg Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca), {{which is one of}} the main prey species for martial eagles in Kruger National Park. Larger wading birds are also fairly frequently attacked including herons and egrets, flamingoes storks, ibises, spoonbills and cranes. The diversity and number of storks taken is particularly impressive. They are known to take 8 species of stork, ranging from the smallest known species, the 1.08 kg African openbill (Anastomus lamelligerus), to the tallest species in the world, the 6.16 kg, 1.5 m-tall saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis). One naturalists observed up to a half dozen attacks in different parts of Africa on 3.45 kg white storks (Ciconia ciconia). Short of three attacks on spotted thick-knees (<b>Burhinus</b> <b>capensis),</b> which weigh about 0.42 kg, so far as is known small waders or shorebirds are ignored as prey. Other assorted avian prey may consists of ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks (frequently resulting in the immediate ire of protective ostrich parents), sandgrouse, pigeons and doves, hornbills and crows. Beyond occasional captures of other birds of prey (covered later), one other impressive avian prey species is the southern ground hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri), which at 3.77 kg is probably the world’s largest hornbill. At the other end of the scale, some martial eagles may capture a few small social species of passerine, which are exceptionally small prey (the smallest recorded prey species for the eagle overall), potentially consisting of the 18.6 g red-billed queleas (Quelea quelea) and the 27.4 g sociable weavers (Philetairus socius), as practically every meat-eating bird in Africa may be attracted to these species’ colonial abundance.|$|E
40|$|Studies of pre-fledging {{growth and}} {{energetics}} in precocial (self-feeding) shorebird species {{have shown that}} chicks expend large amounts of energy on thermoregulation and activity. We investigated the pre-fledging growth and energetics of Spotted Thick- knee (<b>Burhinus</b> <b>capensis)</b> chicks, which are semi- precocial (fed by their parents), near Cape Town, South Africa, to determine whether semi- precocial development would reduce the energy expenditure of chicks and enable them to grow faster. In addition, because Spotted Thick- knees are nocturnally feeding shorebirds, we hypothesised that their more limited foraging time (compared with diurnal feeders) would negatively influence growth and energy expenditure of chicks during their spring - summer breeding season. The growth- rate coefficient, resting metabolic rate, peak daily metabolisable energy and total metabolisable energy of Spotted Thick- knee chicks were similar to the values predicted for birds of their size. Therefore, the potential negative impact of nocturnal feeding on growth of chicks may be being countered by reduced chick energy expenditure on thermoregulation and activity owing to parental feeding, and adults potentially extending their foraging time into the day as their chicks become larger. The relative energy requirements of growing Thick- knee chicks were greater than those of precocial shorebird chicks in the same climate of the Western Cape, but {{lower than those of}} shorebirds breeding in temperate or arctic zones. The semi- precocial mode of development of Spotted Thick- knees did not result in reduced energy expenditure or faster growth than anticipated for shorebirds in general, but their relative growth was greater than that of precocial species at the same latitude. Therefore, semi- precocial development benefits the growth of Spotted Thick- knees...|$|E
40|$|Bloemfontein airport, {{situated}} in the central Free State, experiences {{the greatest number of}} bird-aircraft collisions at South African airports, relative to its (low) air traffic. In an attempt to rectify the situation, aspects of the feeding ecology of birds presenting a potential hazard at the airport were investigated. Plant surveys indicated that the study area can be classified as a dry Cymbopogon – Themeda veld type in a relatively good condition. Using 270 pitfall traps over a continuous period of 15 months, it was established that {{more than twice as many}} ground-living invertebrates, mainly insects, occurred in grass kept permanently short (average height 22 cm) compared to those in undisturbed long grass (average height 57 cm). Based on 4, 843 birds from 51 species posing a threat to aviation and which were shot as part of an ongoing management program extending over 11 years, medium-sized, ground-living birds such as crowned plovers (Vanellus coronatus), blacksmith plovers (V. armatus), whitewinged korhaans (Eupodotis afraoides), double-banded coursers (Smutsornis africanus), spotted dikkops (<b>Burhinus</b> <b>capensis),</b> cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis), Swainson’s francolins (Francolinus swainsonii) and Orange River francolins (F. levaillantoides) dominated the local bird population. Crop and/or stomach analyses of these birds indicate that insects, mainly Isoptera but also Coleoptera and Orthoptera, collectively constitute their main food source. The Isoptera, more specifically the harvester termite (Hodotermes mossambicus), is, moreover, the only important prey taxon showing a conspicuous utilization peak during the relative food shortage of the dry season. A significant and sustained decrease in harvester termite numbers and activities was accomplished by administering Gaucho-treated bait in disturbed grass areas, thereby reducing the availability of food and, hopefully, also bird numbers and bird-aircraft collisions. Implementation of a so-called long grass policy as a control strategy should have a similar effect...|$|E
