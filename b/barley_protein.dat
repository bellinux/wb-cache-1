40|$|Pathogenesis-related {{proteins}} from intercellular fluid washings of stressed barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) {{leaves were}} analyzed {{to determine their}} binding to various water-insoluble polysaccharides. Three proteins (19, 16, and 15 kD) bound specifically to several water-insoluble β- 1, 3 -glucans. Binding of the barley proteins to pachyman occurred quickly at 22 °C at pH 5. 0, even {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 m NaCl, 0. 2 m urea, and 1 % (v/v) Triton X- 100. Bound barley proteins were released by acidic treatments or by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Acid-released barley proteins could bind again specifically and singly to pachyman. Water-soluble laminarin and carboxymethyl-pachyman competed for the binding of the barley proteins to pachyman. The N-terminal sequence of the 19 -kD barley β- 1, 3 -glucan-binding protein showed near identity to the barley seed protein BP-R and high homology to other thaumatin-like (TL) permatins. The 16 -kD <b>barley</b> <b>protein</b> was also homologous to TL proteins, whereas the 15 -kD <b>barley</b> <b>protein</b> N-terminal sequence was identical to the pathogenesis-related Hv- 1 TL protein.

The transformant was grown on solid medium with Avicel cellulose and lactose to induce the cbh 1 promoter for the synthesis of the native CBHI and the recombinant <b>barley</b> <b>protein</b> linked to a cbh 1 expression cassette. Differences in localization {{of expression}} between the two proteins were clearly indicated by in situ hybridization, indirect immunofluorescence, and immunoelectron microscopy. In young hyphae, native-size recombinant epb mRNA was localized to apical compartments. In older cultures, {{it was also seen}} in subapical compartments but not in hyphae from the colony center. The recombinant EPB had a higher molecular weight than the native <b>barley</b> <b>protein,</b> probably due to glycosylation and differential processing in the fungal host. As was found with its transcripts, recombinant EPB was localized in apical and subapical compartments of hyphae. The cbh 1 mRNA and CBHI were both localized to all hyphae of a colony, which suggests that the endogenous CBHI was also secreted from these. In immunoelectron microscopy, the endoplasmic reticulum and spherical vesicles assumed to contribute to secretion were labeled by both CBHI and EPB antibodies while only CBHI was localized in elongated vesicles close to the plasma membrane and in hyphal walls.

The degradation of the endosperm stored proteins facilitates water and enzyme movements, enhances modification, liberates starch granules and increases soluble amino nitrogen. Protease activity is the result of the activities of a mixture of exo- and endo-proteases. The <b>barley</b> <b>proteins</b> are initially solubilized by endo-proteases and the further by exo-proteases. Four classes of endo-proteases have been described: serine-proteases, cysteine-proteases, aspartic-proteases and metallo-proteases. The objective of this work was to develop a rapid and colorimetric enzymatic assay to determine the endo-proteolytic activity of the four endo-protease classes using two different substrates: azo-gelatin and azo-casein. Optimum conditions for the assays such as: pH,reaction time and temperature and absorbance scale were determined. Azo-gelatin presented several difficulties in standardizing an “in solution” assay. On the other hand, azo-casein allowed standardization of the assay for the four enzyme classes to produce consistent results.

This was demonstrated by showing that the component of HDBPF, degraded in test tubes during the reaction to determine their activity, cannot be recovered from malt by extraction, indicating that this component has been degraded during germination and malting. These endoproteases differ in their specificities, pH and temperature optima, thermostability and ionic-cationic behaviour.

In a topical spray application, 30 [mu]g of jasmonic acid per plant effectively protected barley against subsequent infection by Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei. Examination of jasmonic acid-induced <b>barley</b> <b>proteins</b> revealed the presence of several acid-soluble (pH 2. 8) proteins. Two prominent groups of 25 kD and 10 to 12 kD apparent molecular mass were present in the intercellular washing fluid.

Experiments with the transcription inhibitor cordycepin showed no correlation between accumulation of jasmonic acid-induced proteins and protection. The application of jasmonic acid and E. graminis simultaneously resulted in independent extracellular accumulation of both jasmonic acid-induced proteins and of pathogenesis-related proteins.

Of these, the unextractable polymeric proteins (UPP) were at significantly higher concentrations than in spaghetti made from semolina. The decrease of both S–S bonds and –SH free groups in barley semolina spaghetti, with respect to that made of semolina, suggested that polymerisation among the different classes of proteins involves a new bonding arrangement. Due to b-glucan hydrophilicity and competition with starch for water, the replacement of increasing amounts of semolina with barley flour was able to increase the optimal cooking time.

40|$|The thermostability of a-glucosidase is {{important}} because the conversion of starch to fermentable sugars during the industrial production of beer and fuel ethanol typically occurs at relatively high temperatures (60 ± 75 °C).

An alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of barley and sugar beet a-glucosidases revealed considerable dif-ferences in the number and position of N-glycosylation recognition sites (NGRS).

The coding sequences that are homologous in B- and C-hordein mRNAs have an asymmetric base composition (> 80 % C-A) and are largely composed of a degenerate tandem repeat based on a 24 nucleotide consensus that encodes Pro-Gln-Gln-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gln-Gln.

The chain-length distributions of amylopectin were fitted using a mathematical model reflecting the relative activities of starch branching enzymes and starch synthase enzymes. Increased protein content significantly and negatively correlated with higher amounts of amylose with longer chains (degree of polymerization, DP 1600 – 40000) while barley grain sizes positively associated with starch contents. Protein content also positively correlated with the proportion of longer chains of amylopectin (DP 34 – 100). These {{results showed that the}} enzyme activities of starch synthases change with protein content, leading to altered starch contents, structures and grain sizes. From this perspective, selecting for large grain size (or low protein content) does not necessarily relate to starch structure, although may suggest long chains of amylopectin.

40|$|To broaden our {{understanding}} of the molecular mechanisms of gibberellin (GA) action, we isolated a spindly clone (HvSPY) from barley cultivar Himalaya and tested whether the HvSPY protein would modulate GA action in barley aleurone. The HvSPY cDNA showed high sequence identity to Arabidopsis SPY along its entire length, and the <b>barley</b> <b>protein</b> functionally complemented the spy- 3 mutation. HvSPY and SPY proteins showed sequence relatedness with animal O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferases (OGTs), suggesting that they may also have OGT activity. HvSPY has a locus distinct from that of Sln, a mutation that causes the constitutive GA responses of slender barley, which phenotypically resembles Arabidopsis spy mutants. The possibility that the HvSPY gene encodes a negative regulator of GA action was tested by expressing HvSPY in a barley aleurone transient assay system. HvSPY coexpression largely abolished GA 3 -induced activity of an alpha-amylase promoter. Surprisingly, HvSPY coexpression increased reporter gene activity from an abscisic acid (ABA) -inducible gene promoter (dehydrin), {{even in the absence of}} exogenous ABA.
