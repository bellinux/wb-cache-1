In July 2013 Stihl agreed to settle the claims for an undisclosed amount of money.|$|E
5|$|Aside from a brief {{break in}} firing 23 September to take aboard wounded from the , damaged by gunfire, New Jersey was heavily engaged in bombarding the Kansong area, {{supporting}} {{the movement of}} the U.S. X Corps. The pattern again was harassing fire by night, destruction of known targets by day. Enemy movement was restricted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> of her big guns. A bridge, a dam, several gun emplacements, mortar positions, pillboxes, bunkers, and two ammunition dumps were demolished.|$|E

True to her word that she would leave him if {{he went off to}} war, Statton's wife divorced him on 1 October 1920. Five years later, on 21 December 1925, he married Eliza Grace Hudson (née Parker) at the Registrar General's Office, Hobart. In 1934, severe bushfires broke out in the Derwent Valley, and Statton took a prominent role in rescue work aiding families isolated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lawsuits {{on behalf}} of sixteen people and {{businesses}} claiming losses {{as a result of}} the blaze were filed shortly after the fire in 1991. In February 1995 a $15 million agreement was reached to reimburse workers and businesses affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> While not admitting any liability, the $15 million minus legal fees was paid by E/R Partners and was meant for uninsured losses for businesses and workers in One Meridian and the surrounding damaged buildings.|$|E

Around 40 of the manuscripts from Glastonbury are known to have survived after the dissolution.|$|E

5|$|The {{delay in}} the CSM caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> enabled NASA {{to catch up on}} man-rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first {{unmanned}} flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{destroyed}} by the explosion of her own torpedoes. According to Goodall's theory, the ship's torpedoes could have been detonated either <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> raging on the boat deck or, more probably, by a direct hit from Bismarck. This would have blown out {{the side of the}} ship, destroying the girder strength of the hull; the force of water entering the hole, at a speed of nearly , would then shear the stern section {{from the rest of the}} hull.|$|E

Externally, the castle has elements inspired by the work of the French architect Viollet-le-Duc, such as the pyramidal roof over the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|Three {{helicopters}} {{had been}} called in {{to assist in the}} rescue, but were prevented by thick smoke generated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> The upper portion of the building was beyond the reach of fire apparatus; the blaze was brought under control only after firefighters set up hoses atop a nearby building.

5|$|At certain dates, food may be set {{out as a}} {{sacrifice}} to {{the spirits of the}} deceased or the gods, such as during the Qingming Festival.

Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Joss paper, or Hell Bank Notes, on the assumption that images thus consumed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> will reappear—not as a mere image, but as the actual item—in the spirit world, making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved ones. At other points, a vegan diet or full fast may be observed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of July 25 North Korean forces had {{infiltrated}} {{the positions of the}} 1st Cavalry Division so thoroughly that they were disrupting its lines of supply, and Gay ordered the division to withdrawal and re-form its lines further south. Northwest of Yongdong, 1st Battalion executed an orderly withdrawal, covered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> of the Heavy Mortar Company and the two batteries of the 77th Field Artillery Battalion. The mortar operators fought as infantry in the withdrawal. During these retreats North Korean troops disguised themselves as refugees and would form roadblocks in the UN troops' rear areas, or used hidden communications equipment to inform higher commands of UN concentrations so those concentrations could be attacked when they were most vulnerable.|$|E
