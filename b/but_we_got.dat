I did that and I was quite successful. I think at the end of the tour I finished about fifth in the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference. I was the only one who didn't play a Test match.|$|E
25|$|Jobs then {{learned his}} family history. Six {{months after he}} was given up for adoption, Schieble's father died, she wed Jandali, {{and they had a}} daughter, Mona. Jandali states that after {{finishing}} his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him (they divorced in 1962). He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Mona for a period of time: I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back in touch after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't know where she was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida. A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name thus became Mona Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.|$|E

500|$|The FA {{then took}} the unprecedented, and widely criticised step of {{appointing}} the first non-Englishman as coach, {{in the form of}} Swede Sven-Göran Eriksson. [...] Eriksson had a good record in European domestic football, with success in Portugal and Italy, and had led clubs to win the UEFA Cup on two occasions. He led England to qualify for the 2002 World Cup with David Beckham scoring the vital equaliser against Greece, deep into injury time. [...] England were knocked out by Brazil in the quarter-finals and Eriksson came under fire for his [...] "ice-cool" [...] appearance on the touchline failing to inspire his team, senior player Gareth Southgate contemptuously remarking after the tournament that [...] "we needed Winston Churchill <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> Iain Duncan Smith".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Black's near-psychic visions; a phenomenon which had been used with much less frequency in the second season. Executive producer Glen Morgan begrudgingly allowed Maher and Reindl to show the ability in this episode, saying [...] "I felt last year those visions were a cheat. The camera {{would go to a}} coffee cup and Frank would say, 'The murderer used a coffee cup.' It drove me nuts. What we were trying to do this year was elevate Frank's visions to a dream-like state, so he would have to interpret what he's seeing. There would be more mystical, symbolic imagery that might give him more of a sense of what's going on. I had wanted to strip away the gift {{for a long time and}} see if the show really played without it. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back into that".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "We Ride" [...] was filmed in Miami and the Florida Keys in August 2006. It was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, {{the director of the}} previous single's video, [...] "Unfaithful". In an interview with Corey Moss of MTV, Rihanna explained the concept behind the inspiration for the video, saying, [...] "We just wanted to reconnect with my peers, let them know I'm still a teen, I still have friends– but to make something provocative. The '' and 'Unfaithful' [...] were so out there, so we pulled it back a little bit. I'm chilling with my girls some." [...] The singer continued to talk about the choreographic content, saying, [...] "I'm dancing , like technical dance, which was a challenge... It usually takes years to learn, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it done in a few days. And it was beautifully shot." [...] The video was released to download via iTunes on September 18, 2006 in Ireland and September 20, 2006 in the United States.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand." ...|$|E
500|$|Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore: Goldfinger's {{personal}} {{pilot and}} leader of an all-female team of pilots known as Pussy Galore's Flying Circus. Blackman was selected {{for the role of}} Pussy Galore because of her role in The Avengers and the script was rewritten to show Blackman's judo abilities. The character's name follows in the tradition of other Bond girls names that are double entendres. Concerned about censors, the producers thought about changing the character's name to [...] "Kitty Galore", but they and Hamilton decided [...] "if you were a ten-year old boy and knew what the name meant, you weren't a ten-year old boy, you were a dirty little bitch. The American censor was concerned, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> round that by inviting him and his wife out to dinner and [...] we were big supporters of the Republican Party." [...] During promotion, Blackman took delight in embarrassing interviewers by repeatedly mentioning the character's name. Whilst the American censors did not interfere with the name in the film, they refused to allow the name [...] "Pussy Galore" [...] to appear on promotional materials and for the US market she was subsequently called [...] "Miss Galore" [...] or [...] "Goldfinger's personal pilot".|$|E
500|$|Although forty-five {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Travis Kvapil clinched the first pole position of his career {{with a time of}} 51.109 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Mears in his best qualifying performance of the season. Aric Almirola qualified third, his Dale Earnhardt, Inc. teammate Regan Smith was fourth, and Paul Menard started fifth. Mike Wallace, Joe Nemechek, Tony Raines, Vickers and Martin Truex Jr. rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Of the other drivers in the Chase, Edwards was twelfth, Burton 17th and Johnson 20th. The two drivers that failed to qualify were Sam Hornish Jr. and Patrick Carpentier. After the qualifier Kvapil said, [...] "Definitely qualifying doesn't really mean much as far as your chances to win the race after 500 miles, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a good pit selection and we'll have less chance {{to get caught up in}} a wreck early on in the race. It doesn't take long to get shuffled to the back and I'm sure I'll be shuffled in and out throughout the field. But the first few laps we'll be up front and hopefully keeping it clean." [...] He also stated the pole was [...] "special", and this was the first time Ford had occupied that position at Talladega Superspeedway since 1997.|$|E

500|$|Both {{teams had}} injury {{concerns}} {{ahead of the}} final. Liverpool {{were expected to be}} without midfielders Charlie Adam and Lucas Leiva, who were both out with knee injuries, while Chelsea were missing defenders David Luiz and Gary Cahill to hamstring injuries. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was determined to claim a domestic double with victory in the final: [...] "The FA Cup is special, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a taste of success from winning the Carling Cup. That will help the younger players in the squad. Winning breeds confidence and you want more." [...] Gerrard believed success in the final would compensate for a poor season in the Premier League: [...] "We are all aware we have underachieved in the league and the squad of players is certainly better than where we are. We will assess the season and if we win two trophies I think it would alleviate the pressure slightly." [...] Chelsea captain John Terry was hopeful Chelsea would win the final, to help caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo's hopes of getting the job full-time: [...] "To win it [...] will put himself in a very good position. He's not thinking of that at the moment, he's not letting the players get distracted by anything. He's very passionate, he's Chelsea through and through, and that's certainly rubbed off on the players. So, if we can do it with the added bonus that Robbie can get the job at the end, that'd be great." ...|$|E
500|$|Mac Sledge finds {{redemption}} {{largely through}} his relationship and eventual marriage with Rosa Lee. This {{is in keeping}} with the motif of fidelity common in the works of Foote, inspired, said the writer, by his marriage to Lillian Vallish Foote. He told The New York Times that she [...] "kept me goin'. She never lost faith, and that's a rare thing. I don't know now how we got through it, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> through it." [...] The lyrics of [...] "If You'll Hold the Ladder", which Mac performs with his new country band {{in the second half of}} the film, suggest what love has done for him. He sings of someone holding the ladder for him as he climbs to the top; this is symbolic of Rosa's love and guidance, which has allowed Sledge to improve himself and build a new life. The desultory romances that defined his past are represented by the more promiscuous lyrics of Dixie Scott's songs, such as those of [...] "The Best Bedroom in Town": [...] "The best part of all / the room at the end of the hall / That's where you and me make everything alright ... We celebrate the happiness we've found / Every night in the best bedroom in town". His storming out of her concert symbolizes his rejection of that earlier life. In contrast, Rosa Lee sings the humble church hymn, [...] "Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me". In a related way, the film emphasizes the importance of the woman's role in domestic life—although Mac takes on the role of patriarch in his new family setting, it is only through the support and care of Rosa Lee that he is able to settle into this role. Sociologist Norman K. Denzin points out that Tender Mercies embodies many of the ideas of recovery from addiction that are part of the twelve-step program used by Alcoholics Anonymous. Both the film and the support group's program advocate the idea of hitting rock-bottom, making a decision to stop drinking, dealing with the past and adopting a spiritual way of life.|$|E
