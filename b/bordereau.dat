6000|$|... "She had a {{very good}} {{education}} when she was young. I looked into that myself," [...] said Miss <b>Bordereau.</b> Then she added, [...] "But she has learned nothing since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} know you can sell them--those you don't use," [...] Miss <b>Bordereau</b> went on. [...] "I daresay they wouldn't give you much for them; still, you could make a bargain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{into the}} garden {{yourself}} and pick them; come {{as often as you}} like; come every day. They are all for you," [...] I pursued, addressing Miss Tita and carrying off this veracious statement by treating it as an innocent joke. [...] "I can't imagine why she doesn't come down," [...] I added, for Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> benefit.|$|R
6000|$|My {{resolution}} {{was taken in}} ignorance of Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> extremely resolute character, and her lips never formed in my hearing the syllables that meant so much for her. She neglected to answer my question but raised her hand {{to take back the}} picture, with a gesture which though ineffectual was in a high degree peremptory. [...] "It's only a person who should know for himself that would give me my price," [...] she said with a certain dryness.|$|R
6000|$|The {{allusion to}} my arbor was irreverent; it {{confirmed}} the impression I had already received {{that there was}} a flicker of impertinence in Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> talk, a strange mocking lambency which must {{have been a part of}} her adventurous youth and which had outlived passions and faculties. Nonetheless I asked, [...] "Wouldn't it be possible for you to come down there yourself? Wouldn't it do you good to sit there in the shade, in the sweet air?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you pity her--do {{you teach}} her to pity herself?" [...] Miss <b>Bordereau</b> demanded before I {{had time to}} answer this appeal. [...] "She has a much easier life than I had when I was her age." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it touching, the solicitude we {{each have}} {{that the other}} shall enjoy herself?" [...] sneered Miss <b>Bordereau.</b> [...] "If you think me {{brilliant}} today you don't {{know what you are}} talking about; you have never seen an agreeable woman. Don't try to pay me a compliment; I have been spoiled," [...] she went on. [...] "My door is shut, but you may sometimes knock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but for that!" [...] {{her aunt}} {{declared}} with more satirical force. She evidently meant that {{but for this}} her niece would never have got on at all; {{the point of the}} observation however being lost on Miss Tita, though she blushed at hearing her history revealed to a stranger. Miss <b>Bordereau</b> went on, addressing herself to me: [...] "And what time will you come tomorrow with the money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{went upstairs}} at last but I ascended {{no higher than}} the sala. The door of Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> {{apartment}} was open, showing from the parlor the dimness of a poor candle. I went toward it with a light tread, {{and at the same}} moment Miss Tita appeared and stood looking at me as I approached. [...] "She's better--she's better," [...] she said, even before I had asked. [...] "The doctor has given her something; she woke up, came back to life while he was there. He says there is no immediate danger." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{it turned}} out the {{precaution}} had not been needed, for three hours later, just as I had finished my dinner, Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> niece appeared, unannounced, in the open doorway of the room in which my simple repasts were served. I remember well that I felt no surprise at seeing her; which is not a proof that I did not believe in her timidity. It was immense, but in a case in which there was a particular reason for boldness it never would have prevented her from running up to my rooms. I saw that she was now quite full of a particular reason; it threw her forward--made her seize me, as I rose to meet her, by the arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, if he {{had been}} your lover and someone wanted them!" [...] And I added that John Cumnor was so {{convinced}}, and so all the more convinced by Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> tone, that he would have come himself to Venice on the business were it not that for him there was the obstacle that {{it would be difficult to}} disprove his identity with the person who had written to them, which the old ladies would be sure to suspect in spite of dissimulation and a change of name. If they were to ask him point-blank if he were not their correspondent it would be too awkward for him to lie; whereas I was fortunately not tied in that way. I was a fresh hand and could say no without lying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then, go {{with him}} as a cicerone!" [...] said Miss <b>Bordereau</b> with an effort of {{something}} like cruelty in her implacable power of retort--an incongruous suggestion {{that she was a}} sarcastic, profane, cynical old woman. [...] "Haven't we heard that there have been all sorts of changes in all these years? You ought to see them and at your age (I don't mean because you're so young) you ought to take the chances that come. You're old enough, my dear, and this gentleman won't hurt you. He will show you the famous sunsets, if they still go on--DO they go on? The sun set for me so long ago. But that's not a reason. Besides, I shall never miss you; you think you are too important. Take her to the Piazza; it used to be very pretty," [...] Miss <b>Bordereau</b> continued, addressing herself to me. [...] "What have they done with the funny old church? I hope it hasn't tumbled down. Let her look at the shops; she may take some money, she may buy what she likes." ...|$|E
6000|$|I did {{not know}} what to make of it, for it could {{scarcely}} mean that she wanted to bargain like her aunt. She spoke as if she wished to make me a present. [...] "I can't take it from you as a gift," [...] I said, [...] "and yet I can't afford to pay you for it according to the ideas Miss <b>Bordereau</b> had of its value. She rated it at a thousand pounds." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't think Miss Tita {{would have}} contested this event {{had she not}} been {{diverted}} by our seeing the doctor's gondola shoot into the little canal and approach the house. I noted that he came as fast as if he believed that Miss <b>Bordereau</b> was still in danger. We looked down at him while he disembarked {{and then went back}} into the sala to meet him. When he came up however I naturally left Miss Tita to go off with him alone, only asking her leave to come back later for news.|$|E

6000|$|At this a {{singular}} look {{came into the}} face of Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> niece--a kind of confession of helplessness, an appeal to me to deal fairly, generously with her. I had brought her to the Piazza, placed her among charming influences, paid her an attention she appreciated, and now I seemed to let her perceive that all this had been a bribe--a bribe to make her turn in some way against her aunt. She was of a yielding nature and capable of doing almost anything to please a person who was kind to her; but the greatest kindness of all would be not to presume too much on this. It was strange enough, as I afterward thought, that she had not the least air of resenting my want of consideration for her aunt's character, which {{would have been in the}} worst possible taste if anything less vital (from my point of view) had been at stake. I don't think she really measured it. [...] "Do you mean that she did something bad?" [...] she asked in a moment.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was going}} to answer, {{but at that moment}} the doctor came in--the doctor whom the little maid had been sent to fetch and whom she had at last overtaken. My servant, going on his own errand, had met her with her {{companion}} in tow, and in the sociable Venetian spirit, retracing his steps with them, had also come up to the threshold of Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> room, where I saw him peeping over the doctor's shoulder. I motioned him away the more instantly that the sight of his prying face reminded me that I myself had almost as little to do there--an admonition confirmed by the sharp way the little doctor looked at me, appearing to take me for a rival who had the field before him. He was a short, fat, brisk gentleman who wore the tall hat of his profession and seemed to look at everything but his patient. He looked particularly at me, as if it struck him that I should be better for a dose, so that I bowed to him and left him with the women, going down to smoke a cigar in the garden. I was nervous; I could not go further; I could not leave the place. I don't know exactly what I thought might happen, but it seemed to me important to be there. I wandered about in the alleys--the warm night had come on--smoking cigar after cigar and looking at the light in Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> windows. They were open now, I could see; the situation was different. Sometimes the light moved, but not quickly; it did not suggest the hurry of a crisis. Was the old woman dying, or was she already dead? Had the doctor said that {{there was nothing to be}} done at her tremendous age but to let her quietly pass away; or had he simply announced with a look a little more conventional that the end of the end had come? Were the other two women moving about to perform the offices that follow in such a case? It made me uneasy not to be nearer, as if I thought the doctor himself might carry away the papers with him. I bit my cigar hard as it came over me again that perhaps there were now no papers to carry! ...|$|R
60|$|I let her go--I wished not {{to frighten}} her--and I {{contented}} myself with remarking that Miss <b>Bordereau</b> {{would not have}} locked up such a glorious possession as that--a thing a person {{would be proud of}} and hang up in a prominent place on the parlor wall. Therefore of course she had not any portrait. Miss Tita made no direct answer to this and, candle in hand, with her back to me, ascended two or three stairs. Then she stopped short and turned round, looking at me across the dusky space.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good, I {{shall be}} punctual;" [...] and I added, [...] "May I {{shake hands with}} you, on our contract?" [...] I thought {{there ought to be}} some little form, it would make me really feel easier, for I foresaw {{that there would be no}} other. Besides, though Miss <b>Bordereau</b> could not today be called {{personally}} attractive and there was something even in her wasted antiquity that bade one stand at one's distance, I felt an irresistible desire to hold in my own for a moment the hand that Jeffrey Aspern had pressed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, sir, when I {{move out}} of this it won't be {{to sit in the}} air, and I'm afraid that any that may be {{stirring}} around me won't be particularly sweet! It will be a very dark shade indeed. But that won't be just yet," [...] Miss <b>Bordereau</b> continued cannily, as if to correct any hopes that this courageous allusion to the last receptacle of her mortality might lead me to entertain. [...] "I have sat here many a day and I have had enough of arbors in my time. But I'm not afraid to wait till I'm called." ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Miss Tita had got up, discountenanced and helpless, and as {{we stood}} there before her aunt it would {{certainly}} have seemed to a spectator of the scene that the old woman was amusing herself at our expense. Miss Tita protested, in a confusion of exclamations and murmurs; but I lost no time in saying that if she would do me the honor to accept the hospitality of my boat I would engage that she should not be bored. Or {{if she did not}} want so much of my company the boat itself, with the gondolier, was at her service; he was a capital oar and she might have every confidence. Miss Tita, without definitely answering this speech, looked away from me, out of the window, as if she were going to cry; and I remarked that once we had Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> approval we could easily come to an understanding. We would take an hour, whichever she liked, one of the very next days. As I made my obeisance to the old lady I asked her if she would kindly permit me to see her again.|$|R
60|$|I {{lingered in}} the sala when I went to and fro; I used to watch--as long as I thought decent--the door that led to Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> part of the house. A person observing me might have {{supposed}} I was trying to cast a spell upon it or attempting some odd experiment in hypnotism. But I was only praying it would open or thinking what treasure probably lurked behind it. I hold it singular, as I look back, that I should never have doubted {{for a moment that}} the sacred relics were there; never have failed to feel a certain joy at being under the same roof with them. After all they were under my hand--they had not escaped me yet; and they made my life continuous, in a fashion, with the illustrious life they had touched at the other end. I lost myself in this satisfaction to the point of assuming--in my quiet extravagance--that poor Miss Tita also went back, went back, as I used to phrase it. She did indeed, the gentle spinster, but not quite so far as Jeffrey Aspern, who was simply hearsay to her, quite as he was to me. Only she had lived for years with Juliana, she had seen and handled the papers and (even though she was stupid) some esoteric knowledge had rubbed off on her. That was what the old woman represented--esoteric knowledge; and this was the idea with which my editorial heart used to thrill. It literally beat faster often, of an evening, when I had been out, as I stopped with my candle in the re-echoing hall on my way up to bed. It was as if at such a moment as that, in the stillness, after the long contradiction of the day, Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> secrets were in the air, the wonder of her survival more palpable. These were the acute impressions. I had them in another form, with more of a certain sort of reciprocity, during the hours that I sat in the garden looking up over the top of my book at the closed windows of my hostess. In these windows no sign of life ever appeared; it was as if, for fear of my catching a glimpse of them, the two ladies passed their days in the dark. But this only proved to me that they had something to conceal; which was what I had wished to demonstrate. Their motionless shutters became as expressive as eyes consciously closed, and I took comfort in thinking that at all events through invisible themselves they saw me between the lashes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] the {{old woman}} {{returned}} with dignity and with an inclination of her head which evidently signified that I might depart. I passed out of the room, reflecting {{that it would not}} be easy to circumvent her. As I stood in the sala again I saw that Miss Tita had followed me, and I supposed that as her aunt had neglected to suggest that I should take a look at my quarters it was her purpose to repair the omission. But she made no such suggestion; she only stood there with a dim, though not a languid smile, and with an effect of irresponsible, incompetent youth which was almost comically at variance with the faded facts of her person. She was not infirm, like her aunt, but she struck me as still more helpless, because her inefficiency was spiritual, which was not the case with Miss <b>Bordereau's.</b> I waited to see if she would offer to show me the rest of the house, but I did not precipitate the question, inasmuch as my plan was from this moment to spend as much of my time as possible in her society. I only observed at the end of a minute: ...|$|R
60|$|The fear of {{what this}} side of her {{character}} might have led her to do made me nervous for days afterward. I waited for an intimation from Miss Tita; I almost figured to myself {{that it was her}} duty to keep me informed, to let me know definitely whether or no Miss <b>Bordereau</b> had sacrificed her treasures. But as she gave no sign I lost patience and determined to judge so far as was possible with my own senses. I sent late one afternoon to ask if I might pay the ladies a visit, and my servant came back with surprising news. Miss <b>Bordereau</b> could be approached without the least difficulty; she had been moved out into the sala and was sitting by the window that overlooked the garden. I descended and found this picture correct; the old lady had been wheeled forth into the world and had a certain air, which came mainly perhaps from some brighter element in her dress, of being prepared again to have converse with it. It had not yet, however, begun to flock about her; she was perfectly alone and, though the door leading to her own quarters stood open, I had at first no glimpse of Miss Tita. The window at which she sat had the afternoon shade and, one of the shutters having been pushed back, she could see the pleasant garden, where the summer sun had by this time dried up too many of the plants--she could see the yellow light and the long shadows.|$|E
6000|$|Considering {{how little}} {{satisfaction}} I got from {{it at first}} {{it is remarkable that}} I should not have grown more tired of wondering what mystic rites of ennui the Misses <b>Bordereau</b> celebrated in their darkened rooms; whether this had always been the tenor of their life and how in previous years they had escaped elbowing their neighbors. It was clear that they must have had other habits and other circumstances; that they must once have been young or at least middle-aged. There was no end to the questions it was possible to ask about them and no end to the answers {{it was not possible to}} frame. I had known many of my country-people in Europe and was familiar with the strange ways they were liable to take up there; but the Misses <b>Bordereau</b> formed altogether a new type of the American absentee. Indeed it was plain that the American name had ceased to have any application to them--I had seen this in the ten minutes I spent in the old woman's room. You could never have said whence they came, from the appearance of either of them; wherever it was they had long ago dropped the local accent and fashion. There was nothing in them that one recognized, and putting the question of speech aside they might have been Norwegians or Spaniards. Miss <b>Bordereau,</b> after all, had been in Europe nearly three-quarters of a century; it appeared by some verses addressed to her by Aspern on the occasion of his own second absence from America--verses of which Cumnor and I had after infinite conjecture established solidly enough the date--that she was even then, as a girl of twenty, on the foreign side of the sea. There was an implication in the poem (I hope not just for the phrase) that he had come back for her sake. We had no real light upon her circumstances at that moment, any more than we had upon her origin, which we believed to be of the sort usually spoken of as modest. Cumnor had a theory that she had been a governess in some family in which the poet visited and that, in consequence of her position, there was from the first something unavowed, or rather something positively clandestine, in their relations. I on the other hand had hatched a little romance according to which she was the daughter of an artist, a painter or a sculptor, who had left the western world when the century was fresh, to study in the ancient schools. It was essential to my hypothesis that this amiable man should have lost his wife, should have been poor and unsuccessful and should have had a second daughter, of a disposition quite different from Juliana's. It was also indispensable that he should have been accompanied to Europe by these young ladies and should have established himself there for the remainder of a struggling, saddened life. There was a further implication that Miss <b>Bordereau</b> had had in her youth a perverse and adventurous, albeit a generous and fascinating character, and that she had passed through some singular vicissitudes. By what passions had she been ravaged, by what sufferings had she been blanched, what store of memories had she laid away for the monotonous future? ...|$|E
6000|$|One afternoon, as I {{came down}} from my {{quarters}} to go out, I found Miss Tita in the sala: it was our first encounter on that ground since I {{had come to the}} house. She put on no air of being there by accident; there was an ignorance of such arts in her angular, diffident directness. That I might be quite sure she was waiting for me she informed me of the fact and told me that Miss <b>Bordereau</b> wished to see me: she would take me into the room at that moment if I had time. If I had been late for a love tryst I would have stayed for this, and I quickly signified that I should be delighted to wait upon the old lady. [...] "She wants to talk with you--to know you," [...] Miss Tita said, smiling as if she herself appreciated that idea; and she led me to the door of her aunt's apartment. I stopped her a moment before she had opened it, looking at her with some curiosity. I told her that this was a great satisfaction to me and a great honor; but all the same I should like to ask what had made Miss <b>Bordereau</b> change so suddenly. It was only the other day that she wouldn't suffer me near her. Miss Tita was not embarrassed by my question; she had as many little unexpected serenities as if she told fibs, but the odd part of them was that they had on the contrary their source in her truthfulness. [...] "Oh, my aunt changes," [...] she answered; [...] "it's so terribly dull--I suppose she's tired." ...|$|E
60|$|After this, {{for a long}} time, I {{never saw}} her, and I {{wondered}} that the common chances of the day should not have helped us to meet. It could only be evident that she was immensely on her guard against them; {{and in addition to}} this the house was so big that for each other we were lost in it. I used to look out for her hopefully as I crossed the sala in my comings and goings, but I was not rewarded with a glimpse of the tail of her dress. It was as if she never peeped out of her aunt's apartment. I used to wonder what she did there week after week and year after year. I had never encountered such a violent parti pris of seclusion; it was more than keeping quiet--it was like hunted creatures feigning death. The two ladies appeared to have no visitors whatever and no sort of contact with the world. I judged at least that people could not have come to the house and that Miss Tita could not have gone out without my having some observation of it. I did what I disliked myself for doing (reflecting that it was only once in a way): I questioned my servant about their habits and let him divine that I should be interested in any information he could pick up. But he picked up amazingly little for a knowing Venetian: it must be added that where there is a perpetual fast there are very few crumbs on the floor. His cleverness in other ways was sufficient, if it was not quite all that I had attributed to him on the occasion of my first interview with Miss Tita. He had helped my gondolier to bring me round a boatload of furniture; and when these articles had been carried {{to the top of the}} palace and distributed according to our associated wisdom he organized my household with such promptitude as was consistent with the fact that it was composed exclusively of himself. He made me in short as comfortable as I could be with my indifferent prospects. I should have been glad if he had fallen in love with Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> maid or, failing this, had taken her in aversion; either event might have brought about some kind of catastrophe, and a catastrophe might have led to some parley. It was my idea that she would have been sociable, and I myself on various occasions saw her flit to and fro on domestic errands, so that I was sure she was accessible. But I tasted of no gossip from that fountain, and I afterward learned that Pasquale's affections were fixed upon an object that made him heedless of other women. This was a young lady with a powdered face, a yellow cotton gown, and much leisure, who used often to come to see him. She practiced, at her convenience, the art of a stringer of beads (these ornaments are made in Venice, in profusion; she had her pocket full of them, and I used to find them on the floor of my apartment), and kept an eye on the maiden in the house. It was not for me of course to make the domestics tattle, and I never said a word to Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> cook.|$|R
6000|$|The {{old woman}} {{was sitting in}} the same place in which I had seen her last, in the same position, with the same mystifying bandage over her eyes. her welcome was to turn her almost {{invisible}} face to me and show me that while she sat silent she saw me clearly. I made no motion to shake hands with her; I felt too well on this occasion that that was out of place forever. It had been sufficiently enjoined upon me that she was too sacred for that sort of reciprocity--too venerable to touch. There was something so grim in her aspect (it was partly the accident of her green shade), as I stood there to be measured, that I ceased on the spot to feel any doubt as to her knowing my secret, though I did not in the least suspect that Miss Tita had not just spoken the truth. She had not betrayed me, but the old woman's brooding instinct had served her; she had turned me over and over in the long, still hours, and she had guessed. The worst of it was that she looked terribly like an old woman who at a pinch would burn her papers. Miss Tita pushed a chair forward, saying to me, [...] "This will be a good place for you to sit." [...] As I took possession of it I asked after Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> health; expressed the hope that in spite of the very hot weather it was satisfactory. She replied that it was good enough--good enough; that it was a great thing to be alive.|$|R
6000|$|The niece, {{according}} to Mrs. Prest, {{was not so}} old, and she risked the conjecture that {{she was only a}} grandniece. This was possible; I had nothing but my share in the very limited knowledge of my English fellow worshipper John Cumnor, who had never seen the couple. The world, as I say, had recognized Jeffrey Aspern, but Cumnor and I had recognized him most. The multitude, today, flocked to his temple, but of that temple he and I regarded ourselves as the ministers. We held, justly, as I think, that we had done more for his memory than anyone else, and we had done it by opening lights into his life. He had nothing to fear from us because he had nothing to fear from the truth, which alone at such a distance of time we could be interested in establishing. His early death had been the only dark spot in his life, unless the papers in Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> hands should perversely bring out others. There had been an impression about 1825 that he had [...] "treated her badly," [...] just as there had been an impression that he had [...] "served," [...] as the London populace says, several other ladies in the same way. Each of these cases Cumnor and I had been able to investigate, and we had never failed to acquit him conscientiously of shabby behavior. I judged him perhaps more indulgently than my friend; certainly, at any rate, it appeared to me that no man could have walked straighter in the given circumstances. These were almost always awkward. Half the women of his time, to speak liberally, had flung themselves at his head, and out of this pernicious fashion many complications, some of them grave, had not failed to arise. He was not a woman's poet, as I had said to Mrs. Prest, in the modern phase of his reputation; but the situation had been different when the man's own voice was mingled with his song. That voice, by every testimony, was one of the sweetest ever heard. [...] "Orpheus and the Maenads!" [...] was the exclamation that rose to my lips when I first turned over his correspondence. Almost all the Maenads were unreasonable, and many of them insupportable; it struck me in short that he was kinder, more considerate than, in his place (if I could imagine myself in such a place!) I should have been.|$|R
6000|$|... "You talk as if {{you were}} a tailor," [...] said Miss <b>Bordereau</b> whimsically; and then she added quickly, in a {{different}} manner, [...] "This house is very fine; the proportions are magnificent. Today I wanted to look at this place again. I made them bring me out here. When your man came, just now, to learn if I would see you, I was on the point of sending for you, to ask if you didn't mean to go on. I wanted to judge what I'm letting you have. This sala is very grand," [...] she pursued, like an auctioneer, moving a little, as I guessed, her invisible eyes. [...] "I don't believe you often have lived in such a house, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{remember}} that what I {{said to her}} as I {{stood for a moment}} beside the old woman's bed was, [...] "Does she never show you her eyes then? Have you never seen them?" [...] Miss <b>Bordereau</b> had been divested of her green shade, but (it was not my fortune to behold Juliana in her nightcap) the upper half of her face was covered by the fall of a piece of dingy lacelike muslin, a sort of extemporized hood which, wound round her head, descended to the end of her nose, leaving nothing visible but her white withered cheeks and puckered mouth, closed tightly and, as it were consciously. Miss Tita gave me a glance of surprise, evidently not seeing a reason for my impatience. [...] "You mean that she always wears something? She does it to preserve them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{makes the}} picture indeed precious!" [...] I exclaimed, laughing; and I may add that {{a part of}} my {{laughter}} came from my satisfaction in finding that I had been right in my theory of Miss Bordereau's origin. Aspern had of course met the young lady when he went to her father's studio as a sitter. I observed to Miss <b>Bordereau</b> that if she would entrust me with her property for twenty-four hours I should be happy to take advice upon it; but she made no answer to this save to slip it in silence into her pocket. This convinced me still more that she had no sincere intention of selling it during her lifetime, though she may have desired to satisfy herself as to the sum her niece, should she leave it to her, might expect eventually to obtain for it. [...] "Well, at any rate I hope you will not offer it without giving me notice," [...] I said as she remained irresponsive. [...] "Remember that I am a possible purchaser." ...|$|E
60|$|I went to {{bed that}} night very tired, {{without being able to}} compose a letter to Miss Tita. Was this failure the reason why I became {{conscious}} the next morning as soon as I awoke of a determination to see the poor lady again the first moment she would receive me? That {{had something to do with}} it, but what had still more was the fact that during my sleep a very odd revulsion had taken place in my spirit. I found myself aware of this almost as soon as I opened my eyes; it made me jump out of my bed with the movement of a man who remembers that he has left the house door ajar or a candle burning under a shelf. Was I still in time to save my goods? That question was in my heart; for what had now come to pass was that in the unconscious cerebration of sleep I had swung back to a passionate appreciation of Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> papers. They were now more precious than ever, and a kind of ferocity had come into my desire to possess them. The condition Miss Tita had attached to the possession of them no longer appeared an obstacle worth thinking of, and for an hour, that morning, my repentant imagination brushed it aside. It was absurd that I should be able to invent nothing; absurd to renounce so easily and turn away helpless from the idea that the only way to get hold of the papers was to unite myself to her for life. I would not unite myself and yet I would have them. I must add that by the time I sent down to ask if she would see me I had invented no alternative, though to do so I had had all the time that I was dressing. This failure was humiliating, yet what could the alternative be? Miss Tita sent back word that I might come; and as I descended the stairs and crossed the sala to her door--this time she received me in her aunt's forlorn parlor--I hoped she would not think my errand was to tell her I accepted her hand. She certainly would have made the day before the reflection that I declined it.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Prest {{knew nothing}} about the papers, but she was {{interested}} in my curiosity, as she was always interested in the joys and sorrows of her friends. As we went, however, in her gondola, gliding there under the sociable hood with the bright Venetian picture framed on either side by the movable window, I could see that she was amused by my infatuation, the way my interest in the papers had become a fixed idea. [...] "One would think you expected to find in them the answer to the riddle of the universe," [...] she said; and I denied the impeachment only by replying that if I had to choose between that precious solution and a bundle of Jeffrey Aspern's letters I knew indeed which would appear to me the greater boon. She pretended to make light of his genius, and I took no pains to defend him. One doesn't defend one's god: one's god is in himself a defense. Besides, today, after his long comparative obscuration, he hangs high in the heaven of our literature, for all the world to see; he {{is a part of the}} light by which we walk. The most I said was that he was no doubt not a woman's poet: to which she rejoined aptly enough that he had been at least Miss <b>Bordereau's.</b> The strange thing had been for me to discover in England that she was still alive: it was as if I had been told Mrs. Siddons was, or Queen Caroline, or the famous Lady Hamilton, for it seemed to me that she belonged to a generation as extinct. [...] "Why, she must be tremendously old--at least a hundred," [...] I had said; but on coming to consider dates I saw that it was not strictly necessary that she should have exceeded by very much the common span. Nonetheless she was very far advanced in life, and her relations with Jeffrey Aspern had occurred in her early womanhood. [...] "That is her excuse," [...] said Mrs. Prest, half-sententiously and yet also somewhat as if she were ashamed of making a speech so little in the real tone of Venice. As if a woman needed an excuse for having loved the divine poet! He had been not only one of the most brilliant minds of his day (and in those years, when the century was young, there were, as everyone knows, many), but one of the most genial men and one of the handsomest.|$|R
6000|$|One evening {{about the}} middle of July I came in earlier than usual--I forget what chance had led to this--and instead of going up to my {{quarters}} made my way into the garden. The temperature was very high; {{it was such a}} night as one would gladly have spent in the open air, and I was in no hurry to go to bed. I had floated home in my gondola, listening to the slow splash of the oar in the narrow dark canals, and now the only thought that solicited me was the vague reflection that it would be pleasant to recline at one's length in the fragrant darkness on a garden bench. The odor of the canal was doubtless at the bottom of that aspiration and the breath of the garden, as I entered it, gave consistency to my purpose. It was delicious--just such an air as must have trembled with Romeo's vows when he stood among the flowers and raised his arms to his mistress's balcony. I looked at the windows of the palace to see if by chance the example of Verona (Verona being not far off) had been followed; but everything was dim, as usual, and everything was still. Juliana, on summer nights in her youth, might have murmured down from open windows at Jeffrey Aspern, but Miss Tita was not a poet's mistress any more than I was a poet. This however did not prevent my gratification from being great as I became aware on reaching the end of the garden that Miss Tita was seated in my little bower. At first I only made out an indistinct figure, not in the least counting on such an overture from one of my hostesses; it even occurred to me that some sentimental maidservant had stolen in to keep a tryst with her sweetheart. I was going to turn away, not to frighten her, when the figure rose to its height and I recognized Miss <b>Bordereau's</b> niece. I must do myself the justice to say that I did not wish to frighten her either, and much as I had longed for some such accident I should have been capable of retreating. It was as if I had laid a trap for her by coming home earlier than usual and adding to that eccentricity by creeping into the garden. As she rose she spoke to me, and then I reflected that perhaps, secure in my almost inveterate absence, it was her nightly practice to take a lonely airing. There was no trap, in truth, because I had had no suspicion. At first I took for granted that the words she uttered expressed discomfiture at my arrival; but as she repeated them--I had not caught them clearly--I had the surprise of hearing her say, [...] "Oh, dear, I'm so very glad you've come!" [...] She and her aunt had in common the property of unexpected speeches. She came out of the arbor almost as if she were going to throw herself into my arms.|$|R
