5|$|The Fastra II was {{determined}} to be over three times faster than the Fastra I, which in turn was slightly faster than a 512-core cluster. However, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> GPUs in the computer, the system initially suffered from several issues, like the system refusing to reboot and overheating {{due to a lack of}} space between the video cards.|$|E
5|$|The match {{attracted}} considerable media interest <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> foreigners involved. It {{marked the}} first time that the two managers of opposing sides were born outside the British Isles, and it was anticipated the final would receive a large overseas audience because of the inclusion of several international players. Broadcast in 70 countries, viewing figures for the match totalled close to 600million.|$|E
5|$|The playoff {{structure}} {{used from}} 1933 to 1966 was considered inequitable by some <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> times {{it failed to}} match the teams with the two best records in the championship game, as only the conference winners would qualify for playoff contention. Four times between 1950 and 1966 (in 1951, 1956, 1960, and 1963) {{the team with the}} second-best win-loss record did not qualify for the playoffs while the team with {{the best record in the}} other conference, but only the third-best in the league, would advance to the championship game.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  10, GHG {{emissions}} due to <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> electricity vary hourly.

Data {{obtained from the}} Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) provides historical generator output by type and hour [26]. An average day in January is shown in Fig.  14.|$|R
5|$|By 24–28days after hatching, {{the young}} birds start to perch on {{branches}} near the nest {{and take their}} first flight. They are fed by their parents for a further 28–30days, staying close to the nest while growing and practicing flying. At this stage they are extremely vocal, and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them. Though they receive {{the same amount of}} food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave the nest sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two days old died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion by the parents. The parasite Leucocytozoon toddi can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest, possibly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> birds sharing a small space, thus allowing transmission.|$|E
5|$|McNichol {{was born}} in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. His father, Danny, {{died when he was}} five, so McNichol and seven {{siblings}} were raised by their mother, Catherine. He attended St Joseph's School in Kilmarnock, and started work as a messenger boy for a local draper's shop when he left school. His shop work stopped him playing football on Saturdays, but he was able to play some midweek football for Junior club Hurlford United. When he was taken on at the local bus garage as an apprentice motor mechanic, he became available on Saturdays as well. Hurlford paid him ten shillings a game, nearly as much as his apprentice's wages. During the Second World War, McNichol was called up to the Fleet Air Arm as a mechanic, but was able to play friendly matches for Inverness-based club Clachnacuddin. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> professional players stationed around the country, such matches were played at a fairly high standard.|$|E
5|$|Passage through Hull {{had long}} been difficult, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ships which used the river for loading and {{unloading}} goods. In 1794, the merchants of Beverley had advocated the building of docks at Hull, with a separate entrance, so that traffic to the upper river would not be impeded, while the Driffield Navigation had unsuccessful attempted to get a clause inserted into the Act of Parliament which the Hull Dock Company obtained in 1840, to ensure free passage for vessels, {{and the removal of}} tolls for boats not using the docks. The Navigation Company also received complaints from the Beverley and Barmston Drainage Commissioners, who believed that water levels were being kept at a higher level than was good for drainage.|$|E

5|$|Returning to {{the team}} for the 1920 season would be most of last year's team, {{including}} quarterback Fritz Pollard. The Pros also added end Bob Nash, who previously played for the Tigers, Al Garrett, and end Al Nesser of the famous Nesser brothers. They opened their regular season with a win over the Wheeling Stogies, en route to an 8–0–3 record. In week 11, the Pros traded Bob Nash—the first trade in APFA history. A meeting was held by the APFA to determine a winner, and the Pros' season concluded with the team winning the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup for finishing {{first place in the}} APFA. The Decatur Staleys and the Buffalo All-Americans demanded the title <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> wins each team had.|$|E
5|$|The {{crown of}} the tooth is {{triangular}} and contains six cusps, connected by low crests, that surround two prominent, low-lying fossae (basins) and a third, smaller fossa. Because {{of the complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues interpreted it as a molar; <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> roots, the arrangement of the cusps, and the shape of the tooth, as an upper molar; and because it tapers towards the end, as a last molar. One side, the longest, is flat and low compared to the others, suggesting it is the labial (outer) face. This would imply that the tooth is from the left jaw. Under this interpretation, the length of the tooth is 2.65mm, width is 2.20mm, height at the labial side is 1.05mm, and height at the lingual side is 1.30mm.|$|E
