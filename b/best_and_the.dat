5|$|Parseghian also {{recognized}} talent in quarterback John Huarte {{and wide receiver}} Jack Snow, who had been used only sparingly for two seasons by previous coaches. Huarte could throw far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change. Snow was large for a receiver of his era, but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout. Still, expectations were muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told his coaches that the team would have a 6–4 record if they were lucky. Sports Illustrated predicted a 5–5 record at <b>best,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> team did not rank among the top 20 programs {{in the country in}} the pre-season AP Poll.|$|E

According to Coomaraswamy's interpretation of Devas and Asuras, both these natures exist in each human being, the tyrant and the angel is within each being, the <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> worst within each person struggles before choices and one's own nature, and the Hindu formulation of Devas and Asuras is an eternal dance between these within each person.|$|E

25|$|Just {{two years}} later, {{in the wake}} of an {{economic}} crisis, not one of the privately owned English newspapers had survived. The party established its own English-language paper, The National Socialist, in May 1878 but managed to keep the publication alive only one year. The year 1878 saw the establishment of a more enduring newspaper: the German-language New Yorker Volkszeitung (New York People's News). The Volkszeitung included material by the <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> brightest of the German-American socialist movement, including Alexander Jonas, Adolph Douai, and Sergei Shevitch, and Herman Schlüter and quickly emerged as the leading voice of the SLP during the last decades of the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Logistical {{organization}} of eighteenth century armies was chaotic at <b>best,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British Army was no exception. No logistical corps {{existed in the}} modern sense; while on campaign in foreign territories such as America, horses, wagons, and drivers were frequently requisitioned from the locals, often by impressment or by hire. No centrally organized medical corps existed. It was common for surgeons to have no formal medical education, and no diploma or entry examination was required. Nurses sometimes were apprentices to surgeons, but many were drafted from the women who followed the army. Army surgeons and doctors were poorly paid and were regarded as social inferiors to other officers.|$|E

25|$|Itagaki is {{thorough}} {{with his}} games, working on them {{from start to}} release, and even post release to correct what he feels are deficiencies, and polish them up to their full potential. He has shown this in his project developments, such as pushing back the release of Dead or Alive 4 just to polish the game based on feedback of top Japanese Dead or Alive players recruited to test it out. For Ninja Gaiden, he wanted to leave the <b>best</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ultimate action game on the Xbox {{before moving on to}} the Xbox 360, thus he reworked the game and integrated the additional downloadable content to produce Ninja Gaiden Black. With Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball, he chose to patch an easy-cash exploit rather than leaving it alone and ruminating over the consequences.|$|E
