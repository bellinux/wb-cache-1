5|$|A {{laboratory}} test showed how males of P. fimbriata from Queensland minimise {{the risk of}} meeting each other, by recognising fresh pieces of <b>blotting</b> paper, some containing their own silk draglines and some containing another male's draglines. Males also were attracted by fresh <b>blotting</b> paper containing females' draglines, while females {{do not respond to}} fresh <b>blotting</b> paper containing males' draglines. This suggested that the males usually search for females, rather than vice versa. Neither sex responded to one week-old <b>blotting</b> paper, irrespective of whether it contained males' or females' draglines. A similar series of tests showed that P. labiata showed the same patterns of responses between the sexes.|$|E

While his elder brother was a serious and {{thoughtful}} child, Alexander was mischievous and extroverted; he smoked cigarettes made from <b>blotting</b> paper, set fire to the games room in the palace, and recklessly lost control of a toy cart in which he and his younger brother Paul were rolling down a hill, tipping his toddler brother a distance of six feet into brambles.|$|E
5|$|A test in 2001 {{showed that}} four jumping species take nectar, either by sucking free nectar {{from the surface}} of flowers or biting the flowers with their fangs. The spiders fed in cycles of two to four minutes, then groomed their bodies and {{especially}} their chelicerae, before another cycle. A more formal part of the test showed that 90juvenile jumping spiders, including P. fimbriata, generally prefer to suck from <b>blotting</b> soaked with a 30% solution of sugar rather than paper soaked with distilled water. The authors suggest that, in the wild, nectar may be a frequent, convenient way to get some nutrients, as it would avoid the work, risks and costs (such as making venom) of predation. Jumping spiders may benefit from amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals normally found in nectar.|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} three {{methods for}} detecting enteropathogens in 416 children with diarrhea: (i) examination of 10 lactose-fermenting and all non-lactose-fermenting Escherichia coli (colony blots); (ii) examination of 300 colonies (replicate blots); and (iii) {{determination of the}} total bacterial growth of stools (stool <b>blots).</b> All specimens were spotted onto Whatman 541 filters and hybridized with specific radiolabeled DNA probes. Enterotoxigenic E. coli was detected in 38 patients by examining colony <b>blots,</b> in 52 patients by examining replicate <b>blots,</b> and in 45 patients by examining stool <b>blots.</b> Enteropathogenic E. coli adhesin factor was detected in 12 patients by colony <b>blots,</b> in 25 patients by replicate <b>blots,</b> and in 16 patients by stool <b>blots.</b> E. coli that hybridized with the enterohemorrhagic E. coli probe was detected in 2 patients by colony <b>blots,</b> in 11 patients by replicate <b>blots,</b> and in 0 patients by stool <b>blots.</b> Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli was detected in 0 patients by colony <b>blots,</b> in 12 patients by replicate <b>blots,</b> and in 0 patients by stool <b>blots.</b> Shigella spp. were identified by standard bacteriological methods in 82 patients, and enteroinvasive E. coli was identified by colony <b>blots</b> in 11 patients (total, 93), by replicate <b>blots</b> in 56 patients, and by stool <b>blots</b> in 35 patients. Of 82 culture-confirmed Shigella infections, 45 were identified by examining replicate <b>blots</b> with the 17 -kilobase-pair probe and 36 were identified by examination with the Ipa probe (P less than 0. 05). Examining replicate <b>blots</b> with specific probes identified more enterotoxigenic E. coli (P < 0. 005), enteropathogenic E. coli adhesion factor-producing E. coli (P < 0. 001), and Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli (P < 0. 005) infections than examining colony <b>blots.</b> More Shigella and enteroinvasive E. coli infections were identified by standard bacteriological methods and examining colony <b>blots</b> with a specific probe than by examining replicate and stool <b>blots</b> (P < 0. 001) ...|$|R
50|$|A dot <b>blot</b> (or slot <b>blot)</b> is a {{technique}} in molecular biology used to detect biomolecules, and for detecting, analyzing, and identifying proteins. It represents a simplification of the northern <b>blot,</b> Southern <b>blot,</b> or western <b>blot</b> methods. In a dot <b>blot</b> the biomolecules to be detected are not first separated by electrophoresis. Instead, a mixture containing the molecule to be detected is applied directly on a membrane as a dot, and then is spotted through circular templates directly onto the membrane or paper substrate. This differs from the western <b>blot</b> because protein samples are not separated electrophoretically. This is then followed by detection by either nucleotide probes (for a northern <b>blot</b> and southern <b>blot)</b> or antibodies (for a western <b>blot).</b>|$|R

40|$|Following {{publication}} of our recent article [1], {{an error in}} Figure 5 d was noticed. In Figure 5 d, the β-actin <b>blot</b> corres ponding to α-SMA <b>blot</b> was captured on the chemi luminescence imaging system in an inverted orientation.

25|$|Western <b>blotting</b> {{allows the}} {{detection}} of specific proteins from extracts made from cells or tissues, before or after any purification steps. Proteins are generally separated by size using gel electrophoresis before being transferred to a synthetic membrane via dry, semi-dry, or wet <b>blotting</b> methods. The membrane can then be probed using antibodies using methods similar to immunohistochemistry, but without a need for fixation. Detection is typically performed using peroxidase linked antibodies to catalyse a chemiluminescent reaction.|$|E

25|$|Western <b>blotting</b> is a {{fundamental}} technique of biochemistry and is therefore used by many researchers to prove different properties of proteins, based on molecular weight. Specifically, it has been employed by a research group with one publication depicting investigations of rapamycin treatment, acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and myocardial necrosis among many others. For this research, western <b>blotting</b> analysis helped confirm effective inhibition of myocardial mTOR kinase activities by analyzing protein molecular weights versus expected values. This study's conclusion: By using the western blot technique, the researchers were able to discover that by pre-treating healthy pigs with rapamycin before acute myocardial IRI, rapamycin is associated with decreased cardiac function and higher myocardial necrosis.|$|E

25|$|Levels of mRNA can be quantitatively {{measured}} by northern <b>blotting,</b> which provides size and sequence {{information about the}} mRNA molecules. A sample of RNA is separated on an agarose gel and hybridized to a radioactively labeled RNA probe that is complementary to the target sequence. The radiolabeled RNA is then detected by an autoradiograph. Because the use of radioactive reagents makes the procedure time consuming and potentially dangerous, alternative labeling and detection methods, such as digoxigenin and biotin chemistries, have been developed. Perceived disadvantages of Northern <b>blotting</b> are that large quantities of RNA are required and that quantification may not be completely accurate, as it involves measuring band strength in {{an image of a}} gel. On the other hand, the additional mRNA size information from the Northern blot allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts.|$|E
