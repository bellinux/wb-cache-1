Answers to this question commonly focus on intraspecific sources of variation in the relative costs and benefits of supplying paternal investment. With experiments in the laboratory on the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides, and its phoretic mite Poecilochirus carabi, we investigated whether interactions with a second species might also account for intraspecific variation in the extent of paternal care, and whether this variation is due to adaptation or constraint. In our first experiment we bred beetles in {{the presence or absence of}} phoretic mites, using a <b>breeding</b> <b>box</b> that mimicked natural conditions by allowing parents to leave the breeding attempt at a time of their choosing. We found that males abandoned their brood sooner when breeding alongside mites than when breeding in their absence. Female patterns of care were unchanged by the mites. Nevertheless, in this experiment, no correlates of beetle fitness were affected by the presence of the mites during reproduction (neither paternal life span after reproduction nor brood size or average larval mass). In a second experiment, we again bred beetles with or without mites but this time we prevented parents from abandoning the brood. This time we found that both parents and the brood suffered fitness costs when breeding alongside mites, compared with families breeding in the absence of mites. We conclude that males adaptively reduce their contributions to care when mites are present, so as to defend their offspring's fitness and their own residual fitness. Interspecific interactions thus account for intraspecific variation in the duration of paternal care...|$|E

The fact that survival was affected in winter suggests that the competitive ability of parents in winter may also be affected by previous reproductive effort. In this study, we aim to investigate whether (1) such carryover effects of family size on the ability of parents to compete for resources in the winter period occurred and (2) this could explain the occurrence of a survival cost of reproduction under increased competition. During two study years, we manipulated the size of in total 168 great tit broods. Next, in winter, we induced competition among the parents by drastically reducing the availability of roosting boxes in their local environment for one week. Contrary to our expectation, we found no negative effect of family size manipulation on the probability of parents to obtain a roosting box. In line with previous work, we did find that a survival cost of reproduction was paid only in plots in which competition for roosting boxes was shortly increased. Our findings thus add to the scarce experimental evidence that survival cost of reproduction are paid under higher levels of local competition but this could not be linked to a reduced competitive ability of parents in winter...|$|R

E; the number of the cases in which the enterococci group is predominant. C; the number of the cases in which the group of bac. coli is predominant. B; both groups maintain the balance of power. Leaving out these both groups of bac. coli and enterococci, however, some tiny colonies are frequently isolated from the feces. These are usually not recognized in the culture from the meconium, but from the feces defecated after the fifth to sixth day of the age at earliest. These tiny colonies are consists of many different organism, but most of them have an anerobic character. And a half to two third of the numbers of the colonies isolated belong to the group of bac. acidophilus. (II) Anaerobic Culture: The obligate anaerobic bacteria are scarcely proved in the culture from the feces defecated within two to three days after being hatched, but they become,to be isolated gradually in those defecated after the fifth day. But the isolated strains are variable in species, and they are far less in number than the facultative anaerobic bacteria, such as the groups of bac. coli, enterococci or bac. acidophilus.

There is also no special correlation of the intestinal flora with the seasons.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the study}} was to monitor the sea-sonal {{variation}} in the sex-specific responses of Ips ty-pographus to a commercial pheromone in relation to the two generations per year occurring in the Southern Alps. The study was carried out over 2 years (2000 – 2001). Each year, 15 Theysohn traps were baited with Pher-oprax. Traps were emptied weekly and the number of beetles determined. In the same forest each year, three spruce logs were set up at the beginning of spring for natural colonisation by Ips typographus and then put in <b>breeding</b> <b>boxes.</b> All adults emerging from the logs or found in the traps were counted and a subsample sexed by genital extraction. Spring captures were always higher than summer captures (second generation). Sim-ilarly, the proportion of trapped males was always higher in spring than in summer. Except in the first and second week, the number of females was higher than males. During the first 3 weeks of monitoring, the number of trapped males dropped from above 50 to about 30 %. Thereafter, the sex ratio was constant over time, about 33 % males. In contrast to trap catches, about 50 % of adults emerging from the breeding logs were males. The low proportion of males in traps de-pends both on discrimination (they avoid strong sources of male pheromone) and on differential mortality of the sex over time. As the pioneer beetles in I. typographus are males, their number is highest in the first part of the flight period when they search for suitable host trees. Such a search can be lethal for several males, decreasing the sex ratio...|$|R
40|$|Managing the {{availability}} of shelter sites {{is central to the}} conservation of vertebrate wildlife dependent on tree hollows (cavities) because hollow abundance has been reduced in many landscapes and trees do not typically acquire hollows until they are at least 100 years old. Artificial hollows (nest boxes) provide one option to offset local shortages in tree hollows. However, knowledge of preferred designs is required for this to be effective. We investigated nest box preference by the eastern pygmy-possum (Cercartetus nanus), a small marsupial recognised as threatened across part of its geographic range in eastern Australia. We installed nest boxes of four different designs in each of 30 plots where tree hollows were scarce. Designs showed no significant difference in thermal profile.

40|$|Nest {{predation}} is {{the main}} cause of nest failures in many bird species. To counter this, birds have evolved different behavioural strategies to decrease the visibility of their nests, thus reducing the probability of nest detection. We manipulated the long-term perception of nest predation risk in pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) by experimentally increasing the nest vulnerability to predators. We placed treatment and control nest-boxes for breeding pied flycatchers that appeared identical during the initial phase of breeding. But after the removal of a front panel, treatment boxes had an enlarged entrance hole, almost twice the initial diameter. This treatment increases actual predation risk and presumably parental perception of risk.

We estimated heritability as well as genetic and phenotypic correlations of resting metabolic rate (RMR), body mass and tarsus length with an animal model {{based on data from}} a split cross-fostering experiment with brood size manipulations. RMR and body mass, but not tarsus length, showed significant levels of explained variation but for different underlying reasons. In body mass, the contribution to the explained variation is mainly because of a strong brood effect, while in RMR it is mainly because of a high heritability. The additive variance in RMR was significant and the heritability was estimated to 0. 59. The estimates of heritability of body mass (0. 08) and tarsus length (0. 00) were both low and based on nonsignificant additive variances. Thus, given the low heritability (and additive variances) in body mass and tarsus length the potential for direct selection on RMR independent of the two traits is high in this population. However, the strong phenotypic correlation between RMR and mass (0. 643 +/- 0. 079) was partly accounted for by a potentially strong, although highly uncertain, genetic correlation (1. 178 +/- 0. 456) between the two traits.

40|$|Abstract: We {{studied the}} {{reproductive}} strategy {{of a population}} of fat dormice (Myoxus glis) <b>breeding</b> in nest <b>boxes</b> in a beech forest on the southern Alps, Italy. In eight years of data collection (1991 - 1998), we observed births only in 1991, 1992, and 1995. We did not observe young during the autumn dispersal in the remaining five years. Reproduction was not correlated with high rainfall, low temperature in summer, or with population density. Reproduction was only observed in years of beech mast seeding. Body condition of adults when they emerged from hibernation did not differ between years with and without reproduction, suggesting that the adults may avoid breeding when the young have a low probability of surviving their first winter. A capture-recapture analysis on individually marked adult fat dormice identified a very high yearly survival rate (0. 86 - 0. 92), close to that of large herbivorous mammals and much higher than that typical of other rodent species with similar body size. No influence of sex on survival or recapture probability was detected. The long life span expectancy of an adult dormouse (averaging nine years) is the prerequisite for the infrequent breeding strategy adopted by this rodent species to cope with an unpredictable food source. A high survival rate despite the small body size may have been possible because of the long hibernation time (> 6 months). Long life span and intermittent breeding make the life history of fat dormice unique among rodents...|$|R

This pattern was consistent with results of a systematic survey for birds returning outside the nest box study sites (up to 30 km in all directions) within a majority (81 %) of total available bottomland forest habitat, further suggesting that permanent emigration outside of the study system was rare. We used multistate mark-recapture modeling to estimate first-year survival and incorporated factors thought to influence survival while accounting for the potential confounding effects of dispersal on recapture probabilities for warblers that fledged during 2004 – 2009 (n = 6093). Overall, the average first-year survival for warblers reared without cowbird nestmates was 0. 11 (95 % CI = 0. 09 – 0. 13), decreased with fledging date (0. 22 early to 0. 03 late) and averaged 40 % lower for warblers reared with a brood parasite nestmate. First-year survival was {{less than half of}} the rate thought to represent population replacement in migratory passerines (, 0. 30). This very low rate suggests that surviving the first year of life fo...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{growth and}} the {{increase}} in urbanization has led to an increase of anthropogenic illumination in large parts of the world. Effects of artificial light have been reported in different ecosystems, on many species and species groups. With excellent vision, and – in many species – a dependence on day length information for seasonal timing, birds are potentially strongly affected by disturbances of their natural light environment. However, relatively {{little is known about the}} long-term consequences of these disturbances, and even less about the effects of light on different colours. To study this, we set up a large-scale monitoring project in natural habitat in the Netherlands. At eight study sites we experimentally illuminated 100 m long transects at the forest edge with white, green and red light, and left one transect dark. Every year, we assessed the presence, density and activity of many species at these sites according to rigid protocols. In order to have a dark reference for all sites, we started the monitoring routine a year before the artificial illumination was installed. All nest sites and song posts of breeding bird species were located. Birds were frequently netted and banded in order to monitor residence, recruitment and dispersion. We measured timing and reproductive success in birds <b>breeding</b> in nest <b>boxes</b> at and around all transects, as well as daily activity patterns in feeding behaviour. Here we present the effects of light on breeding bird species, including the advance of lay date of great tits (Parus major) breeding at the green and white illuminated transects. We show effects on territories, survival, daily and seasonal timing. Experimental, long term studies are essential for the quantification of the impact of artificial light on birds...|$|R
40|$|A crucial step in {{adapting}} to urban habitat is switching to novel, often man-made, resources. Switching to a novel resource {{can influence the}} dynamics of species coexistence, particularly if it alters trade-offs in performance. While such switches are frequently documented, their influence on species coexistence {{has been difficult to}} assess because it requires knowledge of performance trade-offs in the context of both historical and novel resource use. Western and mountain bluebirds provide a unique system in which to investigate the effects of a resource switch on species coexistence because both depend on secondary nest cavities to breed and, across a large part of their range, have switched to using man-made nest boxes. Western bluebirds are less dispersive, but more aggressive, than mountain bluebirds leading to a successional pattern of species replacement in many nest box populations; however, there is evidence of continued coexistence in natural post-fire habitat. Nest boxes differ from natural cavities in both distribution, which may affect the dynamics of interference competition between the species, and thermal conductance, which may impact competition by altering survival of ectothermic young. Here, we use a combination of experimental manipulations of nest box density and {{more than a decade of}} fitness and incubation temperature data to investigate whether altered resource distribution or thermal environment best explain patterns of species replacement in nest box populations. In both species, we found that females <b>breeding</b> in nest <b>boxes</b> were unable to maintain normal incubation temperatures during inclement weather and experienced similar offspring mortality patterns. Moreover, climatic variation across populations did not predict species' relative abundance. Instead, experimental manipulation of nest box density showed that mountain bluebirds persisted longer when nest boxes were distributed farther apart, suggesting that nest box distribution may be a key factor in understanding how human-created habitat impacts coexistence of bluebird species. These results emphasize that knowledge of species interactions in the historical habitat is crucial to understanding population dynamics as species transition to novel, man-made habitat...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years there has been an {{exponential}} increase in the investigation of maternal effects. Understanding the adaptive function of maternal allocation strategies is integral to interpreting the evolutionary outcomes of sexual selection. Thus, model animal systems that facilitate experimental manipulation and controlled investigation of the physiological and behavioural mechanisms underlying maternal effects are important to evolutionary biologists. The zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) {{has been used as a}} model to investigate avian life-history, signalling behaviour, neurophysiology, mate choice, and more recently, maternal effects. However, a potentially influential and rarely addressed problem with this species is the process of domestication. Within this thesis we aimed to both test current predominant maternal allocation hypotheses, but for the first time in both domesticated and wild zebra finches. Chapter 2 develops on earlier work using domesticated zebra finches that has demonstrated differential allocation of maternally derived yolk androgens and antioxidants in eggs dependent on paternal attractiveness. This chapter specifically tests the ratio of these two yolk resources within individual eggs and shows that the balance of androgens to antioxidants varies by offspring sex and paternal attractiveness. Specifically, we found that mothers allocated a smaller androgen to antioxidant ratio to daughters when paired to green ringed (unattractive) males compared to red ringed (attractive) males. This pattern was reversed for sons, where mothers allocated a larger ratio of androgen to antioxidant when paired to red ringed (attractive) compared to green ringed (unattractive) males. We also show that brood sex ratio depended on both female condition and male attractiveness. It is concluded that investigating female allocation of individual resources within egg yolks may lead to incorrect assumptions on offspring fitness consequences, and that individual female state is an important consideration when predicting a resource allocation strategy. Throughout this thesis colour bands are used as a method to manipulate male attractiveness. In chapter 3 the influence of these bands was further tested to elucidate whether they affect male behaviour or quality. Wild birds were used for this chapter as preferences for bands based on colour have only once been demonstrated in wild birds and it was felt this should also be replicated. We confirmed a female preference for males based on colour bands worn in mate choice trials, with red bands preferred over green. Interestingly, we also found that colour of bands worn by males for an extended period in the single sex aviary influenced both their song rate and condition. Males that had worn red bands sang more in mate choice trials than both green banded or un-banded males. In addition red banded males were found to be in significantly better physical condition. These data suggest that earlier experiments in which it has been assumed that colour bands do not manipulate any form of intrinsic male quality should be re-evaluated. The final two data chapters, 4 and 5, return to investigating maternal allocation in response to male attractiveness, but for the first time in wild birds. Chapter 4 presents an experiment that was conducted on a wild, nest <b>box</b> <b>breeding</b> population of birds. Maternal resources allocation was investigated in both an experimental manipulation of male attractiveness, and also by correlating resource allocation with paternal phenotypic traits. A limited sample size meant few conclusions could be drawn from the experimental study, but significant positive correlations were found between both egg size and yolk testosterone (T) concentration and male phenotypic traits. This suggested that wild zebra finches may follow a positive investment strategy but requires further investigation. In chapter 5 experiments were repeated on wild birds that had been brought into captivity, to allow both an improved sample size and further control of influential environmental features. Again, female allocation strategies are tested using colour bands to manipulate male attractiveness, to allow direct comparisons with work on domesticated zebra finches. We found that females laid significantly heavier eggs for attractive compared to unattractive males, supporting the positive investment hypothesis. In addition we found an interaction between offspring size and paternal attractiveness treatment, with daughters of red banded (attractive) males being smaller than sons. This experiment is the first to demonstrate the influence of colour bands on maternal allocation in wild zebra finches and also provides further support for the positive investment hypothesis in this species. The final chapter discusses how overall patterns of female allocation were shown to be similar among wild and domesticated populations. It is concluded that demonstrated variations between populations and/or contexts reported in these studies cannot be explained by inherent differences between wild and domesticated individuals. Thus, the zebra finch remains a robust and reliable model for testing the evolution of avian maternal allocation strategies...|$|R
