40|$|Predicting {{performance}} of a software system with <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> customer sessions is essential to ensure scalability and availability and manageability. The tools that can predict performance can help in supporting systems in terms of planning, management and system sizing. We propose a new algorithm for predictive performance. That is WAM (Weighted Average Method) which is meant for improving accuracy of predictions. WAM considers <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> customer requests in order to reflect the influence <b>of</b> <b>bursts</b> in the system.

5|$|Although {{its surface}} {{circulation}} had dissipated, its circulation aloft remained intact {{and led to}} a <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> rainfall early on August 20. The 11.94inches/303.3mm that fell at Miller became the wettest Missouri rainfall total associated with a tropical cyclone, or its remains, since at least 1972. One person died in Sleeper when he drove into flood waters which had swept away a bridge he was attempting to navigate onto. Nine water rescues occurred along the I-44 corridor, mostly caused by Erin's rainfall. Damage totaled about $19.8million (2007USD) in the state, primarily in Polk County.|$|E
5|$|As Zeke {{continued}} to be hampered by strong shear, it gradually began to turn towards the north as the trough that caused it to weaken moved further east. Late on October27, convection redeveloped over the center of circulation, allowing the storm to re-attain tropical storm intensity. The strengthening followed {{the passage of a}} shortwave trough; however, shear over the system remained strong. Despite the unfavorable conditions, Zeke maintained its intensity, through intermittent bursts of convection, and began to turn towards the northeast. Late on October29, a large <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> deep convection over the center of the storm allowed for intensification. Around this time, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) with a barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg).|$|E

5|$|At 10:45am on 12 June Private Haines, a sentry on {{the left}} hand flank, warned of the {{approach}} of an Indonesian foot patrol along the river bank. The Australians had sited the ambush to engage targets on the river and were initially at a disadvantage. Ten minutes after the Indonesians were first seen, Private Sneddon, on the extreme left, engaged a group of six Indonesians with a long <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> machine-gun fire, killing two instantly and a third as he ran towards him. Haines subsequently killed a fourth, while a fifth Indonesian continued past him, followed by five others, who then engaged the Australians. The Indonesian patrol continued to advance, taking them towards {{the rear of the}} Australian positions.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October 1962, Plath {{experienced}} a great <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> creativity and wrote {{most of the}} poems on which her reputation now rests, writing at least 26 of the poems of her posthumous collection Ariel during the final months of her life. In December 1962, she returned alone to London with their children, and rented, on a five-year lease, a flat at 23 Fitzroy Roadâ€”only a few streets from the Chalcot Square flat. William Butler Yeats once lived in the house, which bears an English Heritage blue plaque for the Irish poet. Plath was pleased by this fact and considered it a good omen.|$|E
5|$|By August12, the NHC {{reported}} that Tropical Depression Two was near tropical storm intensity after a <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> deep convection over the center. At this point, {{the system was}} not upgraded to a tropical storm; however, in a post-storm analysis, {{it was determined that}} the system had attained tropical storm-force winds, peaking at 40mph (65km/h) for 12hours on August12. Several hours later, the system became disorganized due to increased wind shear. By the afternoon of August13, the system had weakened to a tropical depression and shortly thereafter, degenerated into a non-convective remnant low-pressure area as it failed to maintain convection around the center for 24hours. At this time, the NHC issued their final advisory on the system but noted that there was the possibility of regeneration.|$|E

At first, it seems that Rainbow has the upper hand, but as soon as Twilight reminds Fluttershy that if she gets away Discord will win, Fluttershy puts on an enormous <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> speed and the ponies eventually catch Rainbow and manage to tie her down long enough for Twilight to cast her memory spell.

5|$|However, a <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> intense neutron and gamma {{radiation}} came {{directly from the}} fireball. Its lethal radius was , covering {{about half of the}} firestorm area. An estimated 30% of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation, but died in the firestorm before their radiation injuries would have become apparent. Over 6,000 people survived the blast and fire, but died of radiation injuries. Among injured survivors, 30% had radiation injuries from which they recovered, but with a lifelong increase in cancer risk. To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors' children.|$|E
