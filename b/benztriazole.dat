40|$|A {{series of}} benztriazoles bearing Mannich bases (2 - 10) were {{synthesized}} from <b>benztriazole</b> by aminomethylation with formaldehyde and various substituted secondary amines. Titled compounds were synthesized by Mannich reaction {{and they were}} characterized by IR and Â¹HNMR spectroscopy. All these Mannich bases were screened for hepatoprotective activity on carbon tetrachloride induced liver damage in rats. Only compounds 4 (250 mg/kg) protected significantly the animals from carbon tetrachloride induced hepatotoxicity. Compound 4 N-morpholinyl methyl <b>benztriazole</b> exhibited significant activity {{comparable to that of}} standard drug silymarin...|$|E
40|$|Candida albicans is not {{inhibited}} by {{a number}} of drugs known to affect fungal cells. The basis for this resistance in most cases is unknown but has been attributed to the general impermeability of the fungal cell envelope. A gene (BENr) formerly shown to be responsible for the resistance of C. albicans to benomyl and methotrexate was shown in the present study to confer resistance to four other inhibitory compounds: cycloheximide, <b>benztriazoles,</b> 4 -nitroquinoline-N-oxide, and sulfometuron methyl. Analysis of the protein database revealed an apparent similarity of the C. albicans gene to membrane protein genes encoding antibiotic resistance in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and a high degree of identity to a recently cloned gene encoding cycloheximide resistance in Candida maltosa. We propose that BENr encodes a protein that operates in a fashion similar, but not identical, to that described for other multiple-drug resistance proteins...|$|R
40|$|New <b>benztriazoles</b> with a mercapto-triazole {{and other}} {{heterocycle}} substituents were synthesized and evaluated for their anticonvulsant activity and neurotoxicity {{by using the}} maximal electroshock (MES), subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (scPTZ), and rotarod neurotoxicity (TOX) tests. Among the compounds studied, compound 2 -((1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 3 -yl) thio) -N-(6 -((3 -fluorobenzyl) oxy) benzo[d]thiazol- 2 -yl) acetamide (5 i) and 2 -((1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 3 -yl) thio) -N-(6 -((4 -fluorobenzyl) oxy) benzo[d] thiazol- 2 -yl) acetmide (5 j) were the most potent, with an ED 50 value of 50. 8 mg/kg and 54. 8 mg/kg in the MES test and 76. 0 mg/kg and 52. 8 mg/kg in the scPTZ seizures test, respectively. They also showed lower neurotoxicity and, therefore a higher protective index. In particular, compound 5 j showed high protective index (PI) values of 8. 96 in the MES test and 9. 30 in the scPTZ test, which were better {{than those of the}} standard drugs used as positive controls in this study...|$|R
