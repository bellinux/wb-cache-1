30|$|Now, let us turn to 26 b. Adjoining to {{the same}} position, only in 26 b has the same focus domain and focused {{denotation}} {{as it does in}} 26 a. However, the focus associate in the focus domain is different (i.e., [VP(=FD) introduced <b>Bill</b> <b>to</b> [SUE]F]), so different alternatives are induced (i.e., {introduce <b>Bill</b> <b>to</b> Jane, introduce <b>Bill</b> <b>to</b> Mary}), given that the salient individuals in the context are Jane and Mary. Then, only asserts that the focused denotation (i.e., introducing <b>Bill</b> <b>to</b> Sue) can be composed with the subject (i.e., John), but not the alternative properties (i.e., introducing <b>Bill</b> <b>to</b> Jane, introducing <b>Bill</b> <b>to</b> Mary). Accordingly, 26 b indicates that John introduced <b>Bill</b> <b>to</b> Sue, but not the others.|$|R

5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was {{estimated}} to cost £1million. Initially, with the Crimean War under way, the Met {{found it hard to}} raise the capital. While it attempted to raise the funds it presented new <b>bills</b> <b>to</b> Parliament seeking an extension of time to carry out the works. In July 1855, an Act to make a direct connection to the GNR at King's Cross received royal assent. The plan was modified in 1856 by the Metropolitan (Great Northern Branch and Amendment) Act and in 1860 by the Great Northern & Metropolitan Junction Railway Act.|$|E
5|$|During the state's early history, vetoes were seldom {{employed}} by governors primarily {{because they were}} seen as only symbolic since the General Assembly could override them with only a simple majority. Governor James Whitcomb {{was the first to}} make significant use of the power and vetoed a record of fifteen bills during a single legislative session. Roger Branigin, who presided over a hostile legislature, made the most total vetoes of any governor, returning a total of one hundred <b>bills</b> <b>to</b> the assembly. Despite the fact that vetoes are easily overridden, only around ten percent of vetoed bills are overridden. During the 1970s, for example, 117 bills were vetoed, but only eleven were overridden. Observers and historians attribute this to the short length of legislative sessions, which often do not allow enough time for a large number of <b>bills</b> <b>to</b> pass through both houses twice. Another factor is that legislators of the same party as the governor typically refuse to override his veto, even in cases where they supported the bill originally.|$|E
50|$|Now {{living on}} B Street SE, Chipman {{spent much of}} his time in Congress advocating for the District's public works program.

When Congressman Robert Roosevelt sharply criticized the District's board of public works, calling it rife with fraud and corruption, Chipman fiercely defended the board, saying Roosevelt's charges were based on willful misinformation and false accounts.|$|R

5|$|Gough Whitlam's Labor {{government}} {{was elected in}} 1972 after 23 years of rule by a coalition formed by the Liberal and Country parties.

The Opposition, which still controlled the Senate, allowed some Government <b>bills</b> <b>to</b> pass the Senate, and blocked others.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1893 {{imposed a}} time limit for the compulsory purchase of land and the raising of capital. To keep the powers granted by the act alive, the CCE submitted a series of further <b>bills</b> <b>to</b> Parliament for extensions of time. Extensions were granted by the Charing Cross Euston and Hampstead Railway Acts, 1897, 1898, 1900, and 1902.|$|E

Ezarik's video focused on the unnecessary waste of paper, as the detailed bill itemized all data transfers made during the billing period, including every email and text message. Stories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press after the Apple iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release, but this video clip brought the voluminous <b>bills</b> <b>to</b> the attention of the mass media.|$|E
