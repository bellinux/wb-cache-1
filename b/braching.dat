40|$|At the LHC, the Standard Model Higgs boson is {{expected}} to be produced mainly from gluon and vector boson fusion. A secondary process is the Higgs production in association with vector bosons which, despite the lower cross section, provides an additional sensitive channel thanks to the higher background rejection achieved through the additional highly energetic leptons from the W/Z decays.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of concurrent and reactive systems is based {{to a large}} degree on various notions of process equivalence, ranging, on the so-called linear-time/branching-time spectrum, from fine-grained equivalences such as strong bisimilarity to coarse-grained ones such as trace equivalence. The theory of concurrent systems at large has benefited from developments in coalgebra, which has enabled uniform definitions and results that provide a common umbrella for seemingly disparate system types including non-deterministic, weighted, probabilistic, and game-based systems. In particular, there has been some success in identifying a generic coalgebraic theory of bisimulation that matches known definitions in many concrete cases. The situation is currently somewhat less settled regarding trace equivalence. A number of coalgebraic approaches to trace equivalence have been proposed, none of which however cover all cases of interest; notably, all these approaches depend on explicit termination, which is not always imposed in standard systems, e. g. LTS. Here, we discuss a joint generalization of these approaches based on embedding functors modelling various aspects of the system, such as transition and <b>braching,</b> into a global monad; this approach appears to cover all cases considered previously and some additional ones, notably standard LTS and probabilistic labelled transition systems...|$|E

We {{report on}} studies of charmless semileptonic decays {{based on the}} data {{collected}} at the Υ(4 S) resonance using the the BABAR detector [1] at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. We present a number of inclusive methods to isolate b → uℓ¯ν decays and suppress the more abundant b → cℓ¯ν process and show results of measurements based on: the lepton energy and squared leptonneutrino invariant mass, Eℓ and q 2, the hadron invariant mass and squared leptonneutrino invariant mass, MX and q 2.

The resulting correlations are rather {{strong in the}} case of K-L decays, but less pronounced {{in the case of}} K+ -> pi(0) vv. Unfortunately, they are subject to large hadronic uncertainties present in epsilon(') /epsilon, whose theoretical prediction in the Standard Model (SM) is reviewed and update here. With the matrix elements of Q(6) (gluon penguin) and Q(8) (electroweak penguin) evaluated in the large-N limit and m(s) (MS) (2 GeV) = 100 MeV from lattice QCD, (epsilon'/epsilon) (SM) turns out to be close to the data so that significant departures of Br(K-L -> pi(0) vv) and Br(K-L -> pi l(+) l(-)) from the SM expectations are unlikely, while Br(K+ -> pi(+) vv) can be enhanced even by a factor 5. On the other hand, modest departures of the relevant hadronic matrix elements from their large-N values allow for a consistent description of epsilon(') /epsilon within the LHT model accompanied by large enhancements of Br(K-L -> pi(0) l(+) l(-)) and Br(K-L -> pi(0) l(+) l(-)), but only modest enhancement of Br(K+ -> pi(+) vv) ...|$|E
