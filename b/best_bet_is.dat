2500|$|According to Philip D. Kenneson, to be [...] "religious" [...] conveys an {{institutional}} connotation, {{usually associated with}} Abrahamic traditions: to attend worship services, to say Mass, to light Hanukkah candles. To be [...] "spiritual," [...] in contrast, connotes personal practice and personal empowerment {{having to do with}} the deepest motivations of life. As a result, in cultures that are deeply suspicious of institutional structures and that place a high value on individual freedom and autonomy, spirituality has come to have largely positive connotations, while religion has been viewed more negatively. Abrahamic religions have been viewed as negative institutions because they propagate a certain way of believing. Abrahamic traditions emphasize that one’s <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> to look outside to a higher power that can guide and correct one's corporeal misjudgements. In these traditions, God above is the source of wisdom and illumination. Robert Wuthnow argues that spirituality is about much more than going to church and agreeing or disagreeing with church doctrines. Scholar Robert Wuthnow argues that spirituality is the shorthand term used in Western society to talk about a person's relationship with God. For many people, how they think about religion and spirituality is certainly guided by what they see and do in their congregations. At a deeper level, it involves a person's self-identity—feeling loved by God, and these feelings can wax and wane.|$|E

50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, Great Britain possessed {{great power}} {{given that it}} was greatly developed in terms of government, democracy, and overall structure. Their defenses were near impenetrable. If the United States hadn’t created a Union, Great Britain could have taken over the States with such ease. The existence of an army was crucial at the time since it was the United States secondary form of security against intruders. Since Great Britain’s army was ahead of its time, they also established the Royal Navy sometime afterwards. That army controlled the seas, so if the United States were to attack Britain for whatever reason, their army would be destroyed before they even reach the shores to plan their next attack.

50|$|For {{practicing}} quick-draw extensively, {{the very}} <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> a Jordan holster sewn {{to a wide}} stout belt, with tie-down straps to secure {{the bottom of the}} holster firmly to your leg. It is best to prep a new quick-draw holster by putting the gun inside of six or seven gallon-size Ziploc bags and sealing each one, then wetting the holster thoroughly in a bucket of warm water with a little soap in it and jamming the gun into the holster to shape it, then letting the holster dry completely. Without the bags, the gun will be a loose fit in the holster. For uniformed police-officers, it does them good to learn how to unsnap the safety strap, which is snapped across the hammer to lock the gun into the holster, {{as an integral part of}} the quick-draw, without slowing or stopping the hand in that process. (Do not use a thumb-break safety strap for quick-draw.) A shoe-repair shop can sew a small bent-up piece of sheet metal to the bottom of the tag-end of the safety strap to hold it away from the holster and enable the extended fingers sweeping up the side of the holster to pop the snap on the safety strap so that it will fly up out of the way as the hand draws the gun.|$|E

5000|$|Nomakh mounts a {{successful}} raid {{on a train}} passing Ural line. The poem opens with former factory worker Zamarashkin (from Russian [...] "Zamarashka" [...] - puny, albeit likable, squalid person) standing guard near the rail line. He is confronted by irate commissar Chekistov (made-up name meaning literally [...] "Cheka man") who engages in a long diatribe telling of his contempt for Russians being lazy, insensitive and brutal savages. Zamarashkin retorts that Chekistov's real name is Leibman and even despite the fact he arrived to Russia from Weimar he really should belong to some shtetl in the Mogilev area. When Chekistov leaves Nomakh appears: he knows Zamarashkin personally and suggests that the latter should join the band. Zamarashkin refuses, so the gangsters tie him with rope then take control over the rail semaphores, which allows them to stop the train. Rassvetov is on the train with gold cargo and along with other commissars (named Charin and Lobok) engaged in conversation on the future [...] "americanized" [...] Russia, suggesting that the present republic [...] "is a bluff". Nomakh raids the train, plundering the gold and blowing up the engine. Following the raid the pursuit after Nomakh begins: it is headed by Rassvetov and the <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> enlisting the detective, Chinese communist Litza Hun. Litza Hun tracks Nomakh to an underground tavern where former white officers, now drunkards, are smoking opium in nostalgic dreams of the lost glory of Imperial Russia. Nomakh and another gangster named Barsuk (Russian for Badger) show contempt to their sentiments for times past. Nomakh (followed by Litza Hun) heads to Kiev where the detective tries to arrest him. In the final part of the poem Chekistov discovers that Nomakh has outwitted the detective and has disappeared. Nomakh hides behind the Peter the Great portrait {{on the wall and}} (probably symbolically) surveys the scene thru Peter's eyes. One of the possible interpretations [...] is that Yesenin is undecided whether the future belongs to anarchist rebel Nomakh (who emerges as a victor) or to cynical Rassvetov; however the point is made that likes of Chekistov, Litza Hun, along with featureless commissars Charin and Lobok, or drunk white officers, are clear losers.|$|E

50|$|Santiago Imán was a Creole revolutionary {{involved}} {{in a series of}} events that led to, and help cause, the Caste War of Yucatán and was born in 1800. Through 1839 to 1840, starting on May 29, he led a revolt which helped push the Yucatán's separation from Mexico, which was currently going through tough problems after the Pastry War with France and was also having difficulty, and weakness, regaining territory lost to the U.S, including Texas. He encouraged Federalism in the Yucatán once Mexican independence came and Spanish rule was eliminated. He was higher up in the caste like system at the time as a merchant Creole who owned land in the city of Tizimin. The Centralized Mexican government at the time was becoming more frustrated, in need of men to reconquer Texas from the United States, and sought to gather soldiers by being more oppressive to this deed. Imán knew that his <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>was</b> to gather the Mayan peoples that resided in the Yucatán to aide in forming Yucatán as an independent nation. He gained their devotion by promising the abolition of Church taxes, which the Mayan people for obvious religious reasons didn't appreciate, and with his ambition and the motivation on the heads of the Mayan peasantry they momentarily drove Independence for the Yucatán till 1843; later Independence periods where brought in a few following years up until 1848 where they were quenched once and for all. His drive brought many social changes including the disuse of public lands, and new forms of awarding individuals for many forms of service mostly including military work. His actions would later drive and motivate more Creole revolutions notably the Caste War of Yucatán in 1847.|$|R

After wrestling on {{the lower end of}} the card to get the fans familiar with the team the Midnight Rockers soon moved onto a feud with the team of Doug Somers and Buddy Rose who at the time were one of the top teams in the promotion. Their initial outing with Somers and Rose at the WrestleRock stadium show on April 20, 1986 did not go well for Jannetty and Michaels who lost in front of 22,000 fans. When Somers and Rose beat Scott Hall and Curt Hennig for the AWA World Tag Team Championship the Midnight Rockers suddenly found themselves chasing the main tag team title of the promotion. The Midnight Rockers teamed up with Curt Hennig to defeat Somer, Rose and Alexis Smirnoff at ”Battle by the Bay” on June 28, 1986 to prove that they were indeed capable of beating the champions. The Midnight Rockers would repeatedly challenge Somers throughout the rest of 1986 but never quite be able to get the win when the title was on the line. Finally near the end of that year, Jannetty and Michaels defeated the champions in a ”non-title” Steel cage match on December 25, 1986 on the AWA’s ”Brawl in St. Paul” show. A month later on January 27 1987 the Midnight Rockers defeated Rose and Somers for the AWA Tag Team title.

40|$|One factor {{affecting}} {{productivity of}} Bali cattle is availability of good quality forages. Based on that reason, Australian Centre for Internatioanal Agriculture Research (ACIAR) {{in cooperation with}} Hasanuddin University and BPTP of South Sulawesi funded a program with an aim to improve forage management for Bali cattle in South Sulawesi. This activity was carried out under farm condition involving sixty “best-bet” farmers in twelve villages across three districts (Barru, Bone and Gowa). Aspects evaluated in this program were utilization of existing forages and utilization of new forages by the farmers. In addition, sufficiency of forage for the cattle of <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> farmers <b>was</b> also evaluated. The results indicated that before implementation of ACIAR program, the average proportion of forage used by the farmers to feed on the cattle was 43. 4 % elephant grass, 34. 4 % native grass, 12. 6 % peanut straw/maize stover, 9. 1 % rice straw, and 0. 7 % tree legumes. After program implementation, there was {{a change in the}} proportion of forage for cattle, namely 47. 3 % elephant grass, 13. 4 % native grass, 12. 4 % peanut straw/maize stover, 12. 3 % rice straw, 4. 1 % tree legume leaves.

In conclusion, there was a different in the proportion of forages used by the farmers to feed on the cattle before and after project implementation, in which the proportion of elephant grass and tree legume leaves increased and decreased in the use of native grass, while use of agricultural byproduct was relatively stable.
