Her parents did their <b>best</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> spread the news, because she was born soon after they began cohabiting. Mary Prudentia died in May 1829. Jane gave birth to their second daughter, Prudentia, in 1836, and Mary Shelley was {{selected}} as her godmother. Hogg's friendship with Mary Shelley was disrupted several years later, however, when she republished Percy Shelley's Queen Mab in 1839. Hogg rebuked her for leaving out its previous dedication to Harriet Shelley, {{and they did not}} communicate with each other for several years.|$|E

He was obliged to cancel all promotional events in Europe and North America, but his works continued to be reprinted and translated into numerous languages. Judging by letters he wrote at the time, Andrić felt burdened by the attention but did his <b>best</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> show it publicly. Upon receiving the Nobel Prize, the number of awards and honours bestowed upon him multiplied. He received the Order of the Republic in 1962, as well as the 27 July Award of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the AVNOJ Award in 1967, and the Order of the Hero of Socialist Labour in 1972. In addition to {{being a member of the}} Yugoslav and Serbian academies of sciences and arts, he also became a correspondent of their Bosnian and Slovenian counterparts, and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Belgrade, Sarajevo and Kraków.|$|E

25|$|Existing {{in a kind}} of Neverland where money {{never came}} in, schemes never stayed out for very long, yet no one living or visiting went wanting, 79 Wistful Vista (the McGees' address from show #20, August 1935 onward) became the home Depression-exhausted Americans visited to remind {{themselves}} that they were not the only ones finding cheer in the middle of struggle and doing their <b>best</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make it overt. The McGees won their house in a raffle from Mr. Hagglemeyer's Wistful Vista Development Company, with lottery ticket #131,313, happened upon by chance while on a pleasure drive in their car. With blowhard McGee wavering between mundane tasks and hare-brained schemes (like digging an oil well in the back yard), antagonizing as many people as possible, and patient Molly indulging his foibles and providing loving support, not to mention a tireless parade of neighbors and friends {{in and out of the}} quiet home, Fibber McGee and Molly built its audience steadily, but once it found the full volume of that audience in 1940, they rarely let go of it.|$|E
25|$|After {{the revelation}} about the affidavit, {{a series of}} grand jury {{investigations}} were begun into the cover-up activities of Jefferson County officials. The investigation revealed that high-ranking county officials had met {{a few days after}} the massacre to discuss the release of the affidavit to the public. It was decided that because the affidavit's contents lacked the necessary probable cause to have supported the issuance of a search warrant for the Harris household by a judge, it would be <b>best</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> disclose the affidavit's existence at an upcoming press conference, although the actual conversations and points of discussion were never revealed to anyone other than the grand jury members. Following the press conference, the original Guerra documents disappeared. In September 1999, a Jefferson County investigator failed to find the documents during a secret search of the county's computer system. A second attempt in late 2000 found copies of the document within the Jefferson County archives. The documents were reconstructed and released to the public in September 2001, but the original documents are still missing. The final grand jury investigation was released in September 2004.|$|E

500|$|But Eustace Roskill {{cautions}} that [...] "It {{would be wrong}} to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors." [...] In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: [...] "You sentence off the top of your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's {{something to be said for}} him, you do your <b>best</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> put him inside." [...] Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.|$|E
500|$|Sam Wollaston, also {{writing for}} The Guardian, wrote {{positively}} of the scare {{factor in the}} episode, {{as well as the}} sadness. Neela Debnath of The Independent described it as a [...] "wonderful swansong to the duo" [...] and particularly praised the [...] "stylish" [...] cinematography and sense of danger. However, she considered the [...] "only flaw" [...] to be [...] "the rule that time cannot be changed if one knows {{what is going to happen}} ... though it is probably <b>best</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> question the timey wimey side of things and just accept it and enjoy the adventure". IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10, writing that it [...] "stood strong as a heartfelt, emotional end for the TARDIS' longest serving companions (since the show's noughties' return at least), and the best episode of the season thus far". Risley also praised the three leads, though he did admit the episode [...] "left a few nitpicky questions".|$|E

Wilson. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg in point of fact eschewed appearances by celebrities on the show, stating in an early interview, [...] "Honestly, I deliberately avoided that. The Simpsons is a tough act to follow, so I thought it was <b>best</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do what they do," [...] referring to the copious number of The Simpsons guest stars. He added, [...] "But we've had a few exceptions." [...] According to Tom Kenny, main character SpongeBob's voice actor, [...] "One of the things networks always try to push is getting celebrities."

500|$|The {{mayor of}} Rajneeshpuram, David Berry Knapp (known as Swami Krishna Deva or KD), turned state's {{evidence}} and gave {{an account of}} {{his knowledge of the}} Salmonella attack to the FBI. He claimed that Sheela said [...] "she had talked with [...] about the plot to decrease voter turnout in The Dalles by making people sick. Sheela said that [...] commented that it was <b>best</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hurt people, but if a few died not to worry." [...] In Miller's , this statement is attributed to Sheela: According to KD's testimony, she played doubters a tape of Rajneesh's muffled voice saying, [...] "if it was necessary to do things to preserve [...] vision, then do it," [...] and interpreted this to mean that murder in his name was fine, telling doubters [...] "not to worry" [...] if a few people had to die. The investigation uncovered a September 25, 1984, invoice from the American Type Culture Collection of microbes, showing an order received by the Rajneeshpuram laboratory for Salmonella typhi, the bacterium that causes the life-threatening illness typhoid fever.|$|E
500|$|The 150-person team {{consisted}} {{mainly of}} first-person shooter veterans or longtime Rainbow Six players. Despite having prior knowledge on how {{these types of}} games work, the team decided to study historic examples of counter-terrorist operations, including 1980's London Iranian Embassy siege, 1997's Lufthansa Flight 181 hijacking, and 2002's Moscow theater hostage crisis {{to ensure that the}} portrayal of these operations was accurate and appropriate. The team also consulted counter-terrorism units, such as the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (GIGN), for their opinions on how they would react during a hostage rescue situation. According to Xavier Marquis, the game's creative director, having a hostage rescue mission in the game helped create an immersive story. By allowing players to assume control of an operator tasked with saving innocents, it gives them an objective and a priority. They must be careful in dealing with the situation and try their <b>best</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hurt the hostage. This further promotes teamwork between players and prompts them to plan before attacking, and further makes the game more realistic, tense and immersive. To make the game feel more realistic, the team introduced a mechanic called [...] "living hostage" [...] to govern the hostage character's behavior – e.g., coughing if there is dust in the air or shielding herself if there is nearby gunfire.|$|E
500|$|A black legend {{about the}} Duke of Northumberland {{was already in}} the making when he was still in power, the more after his fall. From the last days of Henry VIII he was to have planned, years in advance, the {{destruction}} of both King Edward's Seymour uncles—Lord Thomas and the Protector—as well as Edward himself. He also served as an indispensable scapegoat: It was the most practical thing for Queen Mary to believe that Dudley had been acting all alone and it was in nobody's interest to doubt it. Further questions were unwelcome, as Charles V's ambassadors found out: [...] "it was thought <b>best</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> inquire too closely into what had happened, so as to make no discoveries that might prejudice those [...] ". By renouncing the Protestantism he had so conspicuously stood for, Northumberland lost every respect and became ineligible for rehabilitation in a world dominated by thinking along sectarian lines. Protestant writers like John Foxe and John Ponet concentrated on the pious King Edward's achievements and reinvented Somerset as the [...] "good Duke"—it followed that there had also to be a [...] "wicked Duke". This interpretation was enhanced by the High and Late Victorian historians, James Anthony Froude and A. F. Pollard, who saw Somerset as a champion of political liberty whose desire [...] "to do good" [...] was thwarted by, in Pollard's phrase, [...] "the subtlest intriguer in English History".|$|E

2500|$|Friedkin {{originally}} intended to use Blair's voice, electronically deepened and roughened, for the demon's dialogue.

After filming, Warner Brothers {{did not include a}} credit for McCambridge during early screenings of the film, which led to Screen Actors Guild arbitration before she was credited for her performance.
