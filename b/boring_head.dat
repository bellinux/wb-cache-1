5000|$|He was a bay colt foaled in 1959 by Double Bore (GB), his dam, Mauna Kea was by Brimstone (GB). <b>Bore</b> <b>Head's</b> {{half brother}} Hillside, by Todman, was another useful galloper. Brother and sister Robert Chaplain and Carmel Burke owned Hillside and <b>Bore</b> <b>Head,</b> trained by D. Judd and Ron Dillon. [...] <b>Bore</b> <b>Head</b> won the 1963 Queensland Cup with Fred Clarke in the saddle, {{carrying}} just 7 stone 1 pound, defeating Booberanna, 1964 Ipswich Cup (dead-heat with Isaacson), 1965 Caulfield Cup, 1965 QTC Moreton Handicap, 1965 QTC Sir Winston Churchill Stakes and in 1967 the Australian Cup and the Doomben Cup. He {{was placed in}} several other top staying races including the Brisbane Cup and Moonee Valley Cup (twice). After winning the Doomben Cup <b>Bore</b> <b>Head</b> had a further 31 race starts without a victory.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bore</b> <b>Head</b> {{was one of}} Queensland’s best staying Thoroughbred {{racehorses}} with wins in five cups, the Ipswich, Queensland, Caulfield, Australian and Doomben.|$|R
50|$|After {{winning the}} 1965 Caulfield Cup, many thought he stood {{a good chance}} in the Melbourne Cup of that year (won by Light Fingers, trained by Bart Cummings). But he lost his chance when the horse {{in front of him}} fell, taking <b>Bore</b> <b>Head</b> and another horse down in a three-horse tumble. Jockey Fred Clarke was {{convinced}} that <b>Bore</b> <b>Head</b> {{was on his way to}} winning the cup that day. The following year he placed twelfth in the race behind another Cummings trained horse, Red Handed.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Boring</b> <b>head</b> on Morse taper shank. A small {{boring bar}} is {{inserted}} {{into one of}} the holes. The head can be shifted left or right with fine gradation by a screw, adjusting the diameter of the circle that the cutting tip swings through, thus controlling the hole size, even down to within 10 micrometres if all machining conditions are good.|$|E
50|$|Boring {{can be done}} on mills, lathes or {{drill press}} machines, either with a <b>boring</b> <b>head</b> or with just a boring tool. The shorter the {{distance}} between the tool holder and the material, the less distortion created from vibration or unbalanced gyroscopic effects. The greater the distance (static or dynamic mounts) the more flex in the tool or an increase in the imbalance of a moving tool. Use of a <b>boring</b> <b>head</b> increases the mass of the tool holder and decreases the distance. If a vibration is created it will be at a higher frequency and the deflection of the tool from the desired path will be much smaller and easier to erase through repetitive tool passes. In the case of a dynamic tool (mill or press), the balance of the tool can be adjusted with counterweights if the tool is mounted perpendicular to the shaft or the tool length can be decreased.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{boring tools}} have three primary {{components}} although many differing designs. The parts include the body, bar holder and dial screw (graduated micro screw). The body, made of solid stock, has two basic parts. The top part threads or presses into the supporting shank. The lower part (bar holder) is connected via dovetail, T-slots or a smooth notch with an adjustment for bore diameter via the dial screw. As the dial screw is adjusted, the cutting bit/s are moved further out, creating a larger cut. This also can create some slight distortion if {{the cutting tool}} is moved further than the <b>boring</b> <b>head</b> is designed to support, if there is undue wear in the bearings supporting the tool or if the tool speed is too great for the off-balance effect caused by moving the tool too far from center. This is called unbalanced gyroscope precession. Once the dial screw has been adjusted to give the proper cut a set screw is generally used to prevent any additional movement of the cutting head. The third basic part is the boring tool. Boring tools can be mounted vertically or horizontally in many <b>boring</b> <b>head</b> designs.|$|E
5000|$|Walk-over {{locating}} system — In first {{system a}} sonde, or transmitter, behind the <b>bore</b> <b>head</b> registers angle, rotation, direction, and temperature data. This information is encoded into an electro-magnetic signal and transmitted through {{the ground to}} the surface in a walk-over system. At the surface a receiver (usually a hand-held locator) is manually positioned over the sonde, the signal is decoded and steering directions are relayed to the bore machine operator.|$|R

50|$|Dating {{from the}} tenth century B.C., its coinage <b>bore</b> the <b>head</b> of Athena (Minerva), the patroness of the city, with a legend. Its people, a piratical horde, quickly forgot their own {{language}} to adopt that of the aborigines.|$|R
5000|$|In machining, boring is {{the process}} of {{enlarging}} a hole that has already been drilled (or cast) by means of a single-point cutting tool (or of a <b>boring</b> <b>head</b> containing several such tools), such as in boring a gun barrel or an engine cylinder. Boring is used to achieve greater accuracy of the diameter of a hole, and can be used to cut a tapered hole. Boring can be viewed as the internal-diameter counterpart to turning, which cuts external diameters.|$|E
5000|$|Lathe boring is {{a cutting}} {{operation}} {{that uses a}} single-point cutting tool or a <b>boring</b> <b>head</b> to produce conical or cylindrical surfaces by enlarging an existing opening in a workpiece. For nontapered holes, the cutting tool moves parallel to the axis of rotation. For tapered holes, the cutting tool moves {{at an angle to}} the axis of rotation. Geometries ranging from simple to extremely complex in a variety of diameters can be produced using boring applications. Boring {{is one of the most}} basic lathe operations next to turning and drilling.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the representative {{model of the}} boring heads obtained from the generalized model of the cutting tool. The model contains axle and hole type surfaces, some of the edges having adjustment facilities. By particularization of the representative model of the boring heads, a large range of constructive solutions could be obtained. The best <b>boring</b> <b>head</b> for a specific need can be designed after studies and simulations done in conjunction with different optimization criteria. Studies on stress analysis of boring heads, clamping system analysis (done by the elasticity of the tool body) and cutting forces (in order to design a dynamic balanced <b>boring</b> <b>head)</b> are presented in the paper...|$|E
5000|$|Another type {{of shell}} {{fastening}} {{is simply a}} large-diameter fine thread. The shell then screws onto the arbor just as old-style lathe chuck backplates screw onto the lathe's spindle nose. This method is commonly used on the 2" [...] or 3" [...] <b>boring</b> <b>heads</b> used on knee mills. As with the threaded-spindle-nose lathe chucks, this style of mounting requires that the cutter only take cuts in one rotary direction. Usually (i.e., with right-hand helix orientation) this means only M03, never M04, or in pre-CNC terminology, [...] "only forward, never reverse". One could use a left-hand thread if one needed a mode of use involving the opposite directions (i.e., only M04, never M03).|$|R

40|$|A {{terrestrial}} {{prototype for}} autonomous deep soil excavation {{has been designed}} as a demonstrator for potential future Subsurface Exploration systems. The Ground Mole Demonstrator (GMD) requirements are to excavate a hole down {{to a depth of}} 100 m on soils having compressive strength up to 150 MPa, advance in the drilled hole and steer to modify the trajectory. An hybrid technique has been chosen for the excavation process, involving both percussive and rotary drilling. To finalise and optimize the design, a test setup has been built to check the performances of the <b>boring</b> <b>head</b> and to optimize the parameters of the excavation. The insertion of several additional sensors allowed the measurement of the behaviour of the components of the <b>boring</b> <b>head</b> in terms of resistant torques, and motion of the impacting mass. The achieved boring performances using a percussion frequency of 2 Hz are 1. 1 and 5. 5 +/- 15 % mm/h on a 137 +/- 5 % MPa soil specimen and on a 23 MPa one respectively. With pure rotary drilling 2. 5 +/- 15 % mm/h have been observed on the 23 +/- 5 % MPa specimen...|$|E
50|$|There {{were several}} aborted {{attempts}} to extinguish the flames. Eventual success was thanks to Mr Schooley, Manager of the Intercolonial Boring Company. Mr Schooley designed a special iron hood, approximately 8 ft tall and 6 feet square (1.8 metres), {{with a tall}} chimney {{at the top and}} a pipe at the side both fitted with valves, and a flange around the bottom. The hood was built in Brisbane then transported to Roma. The hood was lifted over the <b>bore</b> <b>head</b> on cables then lowered into position. The flange was covered with dirt and rocks to prevent gas escaping and oxygen entering {{at the bottom of the}} hood. The valves in the chimney and pipe were then slowly closed, starving the fire of oxygen until it was extinguished. The whole operation took several hours and was conducted during a series of thunderstorms.|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{advanced}} adaptive boring heads with automatic metal-cutting elements is developed. It allows {{setting up the}} heads for the finishing of inner cylindrical surface with the required accuracy, depending on the surface diameter, the value of tolerance field and its placement schemes. We describe {{the structure of the}} adaptive boring heads and how it works. To reduce shock loads when metal-cutting elements embedded for thrust adjustment screws, elastic dampers are used. On the basis of the settlement scheme analytical dependences for determination of the clearance gap between a thrust screw and a <b>boring</b> <b>head</b> regulating screw are developed. The value to process the holes of various accuracy with the same structural and geometrical parameters of metal-cutting elements is defined as well as the value and placement of tolerance field. The graphs of dependences of the value Δ on a nominal diameter of inner cylindrical surface of machined holes and various accuracy degrees are drawn. An image dependencies have practical value and can be used to directly configure heads of production units. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the recent stage of the {{phenomenon}} of subsidence of the ground surface in Tokyo, the heights of more than 300 bench-marks distributed in Tokyo were measured by level in 1942, and their vertical displacements during 1940 - 1942 were worked out. Comparing the recent results with those measured in 1940, it was noticed that the region where the ground surface had subsided conspicuously seemed to have migrated eastwards. The variation in the subsidence velocity of several bench-marks were also studied. The subsidence velocity seems to vary as given by a following simple expression u=u_ 0 c^ for t_ 0 >t, u=u_ 0 e^-h(t-t_ 0) > for t>t_ 0, rather than that as given by u=u_ 0 e^ which was adopted in the previous reports as an appropriate expression for the variation of subsidence velocity. The values of constants u_ 0 and h for various bench-marks were obtained. The expressions of the subsidence velocity as cited above are given tentatively for convenience's sake in estimating the amount of subsidence. The formal difference in the mathematical expressions {{between the two is}} not essential. In boring in Koto region, the percussion number for every lm decent of the <b>boring</b> <b>head</b> was counted which may represent approximately the compactness of the soil layers. This fact may lead {{to the conclusion that the}} measured vertical displacements are due to the integrated effect of the shrinkage of layers of soft soil intervening the layers of relatively hard soil...|$|E
40|$|In an {{experimental}} study {{the influence of}} geometric parameters {{on the performance of}} highspeed carbide indexable insert drilling tools (HDT) has been determined with special regard to the multi-spindle drilling oepration, and from this work conclusions are drawn for an improved geometry of drilling tools and for the resulting size of bores. The work is concentrated on the following four topics: (i) Determination of the short borer cutting characteristics with conventional work samples, (ii) adaption of a model for computation and optimization of HDT {{on the basis of the}} experimental results, (iii) experimental investigations on radial forces and force direction angles in HDT, (iv) investigation on the spindle-bearing system in order to improve the static and dynamic behaviour for HDT application in multi-spindle <b>boring</b> <b>heads.</b> A program is presented allowing extensive parameter studies of spindle-bearing systems already in the design phase.

5000|$|Ten earthen dams were {{constructed}} to capture water runoff and arrest soil erosion, and provide water for stock. Today, the traffic roundabout {{at the corner}} of Gungahlin Drive and Wanganeen Avenue marks the location of a subterran bore a key component of this strategy. [...] In 1967, the Bruces sunk an artesian bore, the centrepiece of an elaborate water reticulation system. From the small pump house directly above the <b>bore</b> <b>head,</b> a [...] diesel engine pushed a column of bore water 1,000 yards west to a 20,000-gallon concrete holding tank through very long lengths of two-inch polypropylene pipe. The water pump could completely fill the holding tank in about twelve hours. Today, this tank is located not far from Clarrie Hermes Drive in Harcourt Hill. From the tank, bore water was gravity-fed through buried pipes to 26 watering troughs. The entire reticulation system could be controlled by one person from a set of stop valves located in the machinery shed.|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{direction}} of mining development over the last 30 years has been toward the use of larger and more powerful equipment. This direction is, to a degree, controlled {{by the need to}} penetrate and extract rock over as wide a range of compressive strengths as possible. An illustration of the success of this approach has, for example, recently been given by the raising of the ventilation shaft at the Kloof Gold Mine (Ref. 1). In that bore, which exceeded 1, 100 m in length, the drilling and raise <b>boring</b> <b>heads</b> had to penetrate rock of up to 550 MPa uniaxial compressive strength, and were able to do this, for the pilot bore at a rate of 1 m. /hour, and with the main bore at an average rate of 54 m/month. However, to achieve this rate, loads of up to 20 tons/cutter had to be applied to the tool, and the wear rate of these tools was a significant cost item. The problems with this approach, are twofold. Firstly, the equipment to exert these forces must be correspondingly la...|$|R
