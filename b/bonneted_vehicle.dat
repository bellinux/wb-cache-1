40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{determine}} the severity of the head injury during the collision of a <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>bonnet</b> {{with the head of the}} pedestrian by using an experimental test bench. In this research were used two types of bonnets: a normal bonnet and a pop-up bonnet. Is intended to find the differences in head injuries of a vehicle equipped with a pop-up <b>bonnet</b> and a <b>vehicle</b> equipped with a standard bonnet...|$|R

50|$|Another rather special type of van {{had come}} into use {{by some of the}} {{newspaper}} distributors, who required a vehicle of about , but with the performance of a sports car! The 15 cwt Ford was used for this type of operation in prewar days, as was the Chrysler Dodge of similar capacity. Large car chassis were also taken into use, the Humber Hawk and Snipe being in this category, while when they disappeared the Austin FX3 taxi chassis was used as a basis for these vans. Ford's entry into this field was the Pilot, a postwar design derivative of one of their popular prewar V 8 saloons. The chassis of this model was available for specialist bodywork, and a number of them appeared as high powered vans and pickups, many going for export. However, because of its minimal load space as a <b>bonnetted</b> <b>vehicle</b> the Pilot was not very saleable to run of the mill van users, a drawback also shared by the Standard Vanguard van and pickup of similar layout and the Austin A70 Hampshire.|$|R

5|$|The {{vehicles}} of each patrol adopted their own markings. The New Zealand 'R' Patrol used a green Hei-tiki {{with a red}} tongue painted {{on the right side}} of the <b>bonnet</b> of the <b>vehicle,</b> and on the left a Māori place name beginning with the letter 'R' (for example, 'Rotowaro'). The 'T' Patrol vehicles had a black Kiwi over green 'grass' and a Māori name starting with 'Te' (for example, 'Te Anau') in the corresponding places. The 'W' Patrol vehicles had a Māori name or word starting with 'W' painted on their vehicles.|$|R
500|$|The British 'G' Patrol {{vehicles}} carried no distinctive markings, {{although some}} vehicles had the Guards insignia. They took over 'W' Patrol's vehicles when that unit was disbanded. The 'Y' Patrol vehicles were slightly different; 'Y1' half-patrol vehicles all had names of famous drinking establishments (such as 'Cock O’ The North') and 'Y2' half-patrol had names from the [...] "Three Musketeers" [...] books (for example, 'Aramis') {{on the left}} sides of their <b>vehicle</b> <b>bonnets.</b> The Headquarters Section used a sequence of letters arranged in a square (see photo of [...] "Louise"). The Rhodesian 'S' Patrol vehicles had names with a Rhodesian connection (such as 'Salisbury') painted {{on the left side}} of the vehicles' bonnets. By 1943 the practice of naming replacement vehicles was dropped.|$|R
50|$|The Waiau Stream {{had been}} at flood level on 19 February when a 5 m high wall of water caused by a cloudburst surged down the stream hitting the camp at 3:00 am. A workman saw the flood waters pouring into the camp site and {{attempted}} to raise the alarm before being swept away. Those who did wake attempted to take refuge on the roofs of their huts {{but most of the}} huts were destroyed by the floodwater. Those who climbed onto the roof of the cookhouse survived even though it partially collapsed. About 11 men took refuge in one of the work trucks but the waters overturned it and they were swept away. One <b>bonnet</b> of a <b>vehicle</b> was eventually found 12 km downstream.|$|R

500|$|After revisions, {{the show}} was divided into four sections: City, Subway, Forest, Monster Ball and {{concluded}} with an encore. It began with a projected video onto a curtain—which contained images of Gaga smoking a cigarette—while a club remix of [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] played. Surrounded by violet light, her silhouette appeared on the curtain while she performed [...] "Dance in the Dark". Once the curtain was removed and the chorus reached, the New York cityscape and neon lights were revealed. Gaga gyrated on the set dressed in a [...] "futuristic, angular, glitter ball suit". After descending from her fire escape, she poked around in {{the hood of a}} dilapidated green Rolls Royce while performing [...] "Glitter and Grease". Upon checking under the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>bonnet,</b> Gaga revealed a keyboard and began to play the opening notes of [...] "Just Dance". Gaga then performed [...] "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" [...] while scaling various pieces of scaffolding and subsequently [...] "The Fame" [...] where she rose from beneath the stage and played her keytar Emma, wearing a giant red cape.|$|R
5000|$|The Commander {{is powered}} by the 26.7L Rolls-Royce/Perkins CV12 TCE twin {{turbocharged}} diesel engine that produces approximately [...] and is coupled to an Allison automatic transmission. The Scammell Commander CV12 engine {{is very similar to}} the ones used in the Challenger 1 and 2 main battle tanks but with an increased power output of around 1,200 bhp 895 kW. Designed to tow loads up to 65 tonnes, the Commander tows a special semi-trailer onto which tanks can be tail-loaded using a hydraulic 20-tonne capacity winch. A prominent <b>bonnet</b> houses the <b>vehicle's</b> Perkins (Rolls-Royce) CV 12 TCE V12 and although the Commander {{is powered by}} the Perkins/Rolls-Royce engine, other types were also proposed - one of the prototypes used a Cummins KTA 600 diesel. The cab has provision for up to three or four passengers and there is space for two bunks behind the front seats. Due to the front axle lock angle, the Commander is highly maneuverable and can negotiate a 'T' intersection with only 9.15 meters between the walls.|$|R
5|$|The next morning, on 24 December 1972, two {{tracking}} teams {{arrived at}} Whistlefield to assist Buttenshaw and Sachse in a 360-degree search: one {{was from the}} SAS, and led by Ron Marillier, while {{the other was a}} British South Africa Police (BSAP) team including tracking dogs. The security forces searched for tracks while also investigating reported sightings. The tracks of the ZANLA fighters were discovered on 27 December on the western side of the farm and the trackers asked Buttenshaw and Sachse to bring the vehicles carrying the heavy equipment around to meet them. On the way the truck carrying Buttenshaw ran over a mine with one of its rear wheels, causing it to detonate. Buttenshaw himself, who was sitting on the <b>bonnet</b> of the <b>vehicle,</b> was thrown clear but Corporal Norman Moore and Trooper Pete Botha, sitting in the back, were not as fortunate, taking the brunt of the blast. Captain Gordon Holloway, behind the wheel, and Trooper Rod Boden in the passenger seat went into severe shock but were ultimately unharmed. Moore, on the other hand, died two days later from his wounds, while Botha survived but lost both legs.|$|R
40|$|For the {{development}} of effective vehicle-related safety solutions to improve cyclist and pedestrian protection, essential information on impact locations, impact situations and cyclist and pedestrian kinematics in impacts with passenger cars is fundamental. Accidentology research showed that cyclists typically have a higher impact location, with {{a larger share of}} injuries from the windscreen area. Majority of accidents happened at crossroads (72 % of the Dutch cases). The average car speed was 36 kph, the median bicycle speed 14 kph. A cyclist simulation study captured kinematics and injuries to head, torso, pelvis and legs for several human body sizes, bicycle types and generic car models. Six full-scale crash tests (passenger car versus cyclist or pedestrian (Polar II dummy) had as main parameters: head impact location (top of <b>bonnet,</b> windscreen, A-pillar), <b>vehicle</b> speed (40 kph) and dummy speed (15 kph). Accidentology, simulation and crash test data showed that the windscreen is a frequent head and torso impact location. Accidentology and crash testing showed that cyclist protection should address higher, more rearward locations in the windscreen area than pedestrian countermeasures. Head impact speeds for cyclists in testing were generally higher than for pedestrians...|$|R

40|$|Head impact {{safety is}} a {{significant}} consideration particularly {{in the design of}} passenger vehicles. Requirements for head impact protection against the upper interior of a vehicle aswel l asareass uch as instrument panel are covered by the FMVSS 201 regulation in USA. In Europe, safety rules are anticipated for enhancing the head impact safety of pedestrians against the hood (i. e. <b>bonnet)</b> of a <b>vehicle.</b> The recommended test procedures for head impact safety demonstration generally involve the usage of freemotion Hybrid III and spherical headforms. In order to carry out the design of automotive head impact protection countermeasures in an efficient and cost-effective manner, simulation models need to be employed. The present paper deals with a new nonlinear lumped parameter model that can serve as a preliminary design tool. A new aspect of the current model is its ability to account for headform rotation during impact on vehicle targets. The present model is also suitable for parametric studies, and quantitatively assessing the effect of rotational motion of headform on head injury criterion (HIC). Based on results from the current lumped parameter model, {{it can be said that}} adherence to FMVSS 201 regulation may also ensure safe levels of rotational acceleration as related to head injury...|$|R

5000|$|The scripted, 50+ cut {{music video}} (directed by Walter A. Stern) is {{an homage to}} the single {{continuous}} shot docu-fiction music video for Massive Attack's [...] "Unfinished Sympathy" [...] and focuses on Ashcroft lip-synching the song while walking down a busy London pavement, refusing to change his stride or direction throughout (oblivious to {{what is going on}} around him), except for one instance where he is forced to stop for a moving car and a reflection is seen of him standing stationary in the car's tinted window. He repeatedly bumps into passers-by in a laddish-like fashion (causing one young woman to lose balance and fall), narrowly avoids being hit by a car, and jumps on top of the <b>bonnet</b> of another <b>vehicle</b> stopped in his path (the driver gets out of her car and proceeds to confront him, while he continues unflinchingly). At the end of the video, the rest of The Verve join Ashcroft, and the final shot sees them walking down the street into the distance. However, Ashcroft then accidentally slips on the pavement and tumbles, hitting the ground as the video cuts to black. This then leads into the beginning of the video for [...] "The Drugs Don't Work". The music video was nominated for a number of awards, including three MTV Awards at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|R
40|$|The work {{reported}} centres on {{the application}} of cross flow fan units to provide forced air flow over the radiator used for engine cooling. It is shown that a cooling {{system in which the}} airflow is ducted through the vehicle would lead to a significant reduction in vehicle drag. A ducted system allows more exact prediction of performance, and can be more easily designed in conjunction with across flow fan, that has rectangular inlet and outlet sections, and an ability to form 'S', 'L' and 'U' airflow geometries. This shape advantage of the cross flow fan also allows the use of radiators with a higher aspect ratio that could in turn permit lower <b>bonnet</b> lines on <b>vehicles</b> with a further reduction in aerodynamic drag. At higher vehicle speeds adequate cooling is usually provided by ram airflow through the cooling system. An airflow by-pass arrangement controlled by a balance valve has been devised and tested. The operation of this valve was found to be stable and smooth, and extremely beneficial in reducing the total system resistance and increasing fan performance under ram airflow conditions. A computer model has been developed and a programme produced to facilitate matching of the air circuit, fan and motor. Examples illustrate the use of this in the design of a system for a 1, 6 litre passenger vehicle, with maximum b. h. p. in second gear being taken as the most critical engine condition for cooling performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Redesign of the {{structure}} of the bonnet to improve pedestrian head protection has recently received considerable attention from automobile manufacturers and industry insti-tutes. The fatality of a head injury is based on the head injury criterion (HIC) value. This HIC value is calculated on the basis of the resultant acceleration of the head’s centre of gravity (hereafter called the head centre) during head impacts. This study analyses the constitution of and variation in the resultant acceleration in head-to-bonnet impacts, and how each compo-nent of acceleration exactly contributes to the resultant acceleration of the head centre. This study also considers how the structural design parameters affect each component of accelera-tion. The causes that make the characteristic variation in the resultant acceleration differ from the optimal characteristic pulse will be analysed and discussed in detail. Based on the results of this analysis, the sudden increase in K (the curvature of the head centre’s motion) after sev-eral milliseconds of the impact process must be eliminated. The sudden increase in K in this duration does not depend on the mass and stiffness of the bonnet but does depend on the characteristics of the reinforcement structure. Therefore, a new design of the bonnet reinfor-cement structure has eliminated the sudden increase in K. The bonnet reinforcement struc-ture, as well as the bonnet thickness, have been designed to make the resultant acceleration of the head centre close to the optimal acceleration pulse. The results of this study contribute to efforts to design an improved <b>vehicle</b> <b>bonnet</b> structure and to pave the way for developing pedestrian protection technologies...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of {{real-world}} crash {{data from}} the USA shows that 11. 5 per cent of pedestrians struck by large sport utility vehicles (SUVs) are killed, compared with 4. 5 per cent of pedestrians struck by passenger cars. The design of the vehicle front-end structure has a substantial influence on injury outcome when pedestrians are struck by vehicles. In {{the context of the}} rising population of SUVs, it is important to determine the causes of their increased hazard to pedestrians. In this paper, validated multi-body models are used to show that the shape of SUVs results in higher pedestrian injuries to the mid-body regions compared to passenger cars. Analysis shows that the mass difference between cars and SUVs is not significant for pedestrian injury causation and it is shown that an important effect of the higher front profile of SUVs is that the pedestrian is struck more centrally with respect to the body?s centre of gravity, increasing the momentum transfer in the primary impact. A further important effect of the higher bonnet leading edge {{is that there is a}} direct impact to the mid-body region, which explains the significant abdomen and other internal injuries reported from real-world SUV/pedestrian impacts. By comparison, head injuries sustained from primary vehicle contact are shown to be similar or slightly lower for SUV/pedestrian impacts compared to car/ pedestrian impacts. However, real-world evidence and the current models suggest that the secondary impact with the ground is more severe in SUV/pedestrian impacts compared to car/ pedestrian impacts. Overall, these results show that the empirical finding that SUVs are more hazardous for pedestrians than passenger cars is primarily a function of the high bumper and <b>bonnet</b> for such <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R
