5|$|In {{addition}} to being a <b>Bencher</b> of Lincoln's Inn in 1944 he was made an Honorary <b>Bencher</b> of Middle Temple in 1972, Gray's Inn in 1979 and Inner Temple in 1982, making him the only person to be elected a <b>Bencher</b> or Honorary <b>Bencher</b> of all four Inns of Court. In 1963 he was made a Doctor of Civil Law by the University of Oxford. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire on 2 June 1978.|$|E
5|$|Gilliat {{appointed}} a Deputy Lieutenant {{of his native}} county of Hertfordshire in 1971, and made an honorary <b>Bencher</b> of the Middle Temple in 1977. The Queen Mother awarded Gilliat an honorary LL.D. at the University of London in 1977.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Bencher,</b> Benchsitter or (formally) Master of the Bench, is {{a member}} of Pension, the {{governing}} body of the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn. The term originally referred to one who sat on the benches in the main hall of the Inn which were used for dining and during moots, and the term originally had no significance. The position of <b>Bencher</b> developed during the 16th century when the Readers, for unknown reasons, decided that some barristers who were not Readers should be afforded the same rights and privileges as those who were, although without a voice in Pension. This was a rare practice and occurred a total of seven times within the 16th century, the first being Robert Flynt in 1549. The next was Nicholas Bacon in 1550, then Edward Stanhope in 1580, who was afforded the privilege because, although a skilled attorney, an illness meant he could never fulfil the duties of a Reader.|$|E
50|$|The Law Society {{is governed}} {{by members of the}} {{profession}} elected by its membership to serve as <b>benchers.</b> In addition to elected <b>Benchers,</b> there are four lay <b>benchers</b> (non-lawyers) appointed by the Minister of Justice. There are 24 <b>benchers</b> in total (including the four lay <b>benchers),</b> each expected to serve three-year terms.|$|R
5|$|Noted <b>Benchers</b> of Gray's Inn include Lord Birkenhead and Francis Bacon. Honorary <b>Benchers</b> {{can also}} be appointed, {{although}} they have no role in Pension, such as Lord Denning, who was appointed in 1979, and Winston Churchill. Today there are over 300 <b>Benchers</b> in Gray's Inn, mostly senior barristers {{and members of the}} judiciary.|$|R
500|$|The English Civil War {{marked the}} end of legal {{education}} at the Inns, although the government attempted to persuade Readers to continue by threatening them with fines. The class of Readers went into decline and <b>Benchers</b> were called as members of Pension instead. In 1679 there was the first mass-call of <b>Benchers</b> (22 on one occasion, and 15 on another), with the <b>Benchers</b> paying a fine of 100 marks because they refused to read, and modern <b>Benchers</b> pay a [...] "fine" [...] in a continuation of this tradition.|$|R
5|$|In 1456 Reginald de Gray, {{the owner}} of the Manor itself, sold the land to a group {{including}} Thomas Bryan. A few months later, the other members signed deeds of release, granting the property solely to Thomas Bryan. Bryan acted as either a feoffee or an owner representing the governing body of the Inn (there are some records suggesting he may have been a <b>Bencher</b> at this point) but in 1493 he transferred the ownership by charter to a group including Sir Robert Brudenell and Thomas Wodeward, reverting the ownership of the Inn partially back to the Gray family.|$|E
5|$|Coke's father, Robert Coke, was a {{barrister}} and <b>Bencher</b> of Lincoln's Inn {{who built}} up a strong practice representing clients from his home area of Norfolk. Over time, he bought several manors at Congham, Westacre and Happisburgh and was granted a coat of arms, becoming a minor member of the gentry. Coke's mother, Winifred Knightley, came from a family even more intimately linked with the law than her husband. Her father and grandfather had practised law in the Norfolk area, and her sister Audrey was married to Thomas Gawdy, a lawyer and Justice of the Court of King's Bench with links to the Earl of Arundel. This connection later served Edward well. Winifred's father later married Agnes, the sister of Nicholas Hare.|$|E
5|$|The Inn {{is run by}} Pension, its {{ultimate}} governing body. The name is peculiar to Gray's Inn—at Lincoln's Inn the governing body is called the Council, and at the Inner and Middle Temples {{it is called the}} Parliament. The name was used for the governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—Barnard's Inn, Clement's Inn and New Inn. In Gray's Inn the Readers, when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only the Readers would be allowed to speak. Pension at Gray's Inn is made up of the Masters of the Bench, and the Inn as a whole is headed by the Treasurer, a senior <b>Bencher.</b> The Treasurer has always been elected, and since 1744 the office has rotated between individuals, with a term of one year.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} {{became more}} common during the 17th century—11 people were made <b>Benchers</b> between 1600 and 1630—and in 1614 {{one of the}} <b>Benchers</b> appointed was explicitly allowed {{to be a member}} of Pension. This became more common, creating a two-rank system in which both Readers and <b>Benchers</b> were members of Pension. However far more Readers were appointed than Benchers—50 between 1600 and 1630—and it appeared that Readers would remain the higher rank despite this change.|$|R
25|$|<b>Benchers</b> are, {{and have}} been for centuries, the {{governing}} bodies of the four Inns of Court in London and King's Inns, Dublin. The <b>Benchers</b> of the Inn of Court of Northern Ireland governed the Inn until {{the enactment of the}} Constitution of the Inn in 1983, which provides that the government of the Inn is shared between the <b>Benchers,</b> the Executive Council of the Inn and members of the Inn assembled in General Meeting.|$|R

5|$|Herring was {{president}} of the Boy Scouts' Association of Victoria for 23 years, and was later the first president of the Australian Boy Scouts' Association from 1959 to 1977. He was chairman of trustees of the Shrine of Remembrance from 1945 to 1978 (and remained a trustee until his death) and chairman of trustees of the Australian War Memorial from 1959 to 1974. He was made a fellow of New College, Oxford, in 1949, received an honorary DCL from Oxford in 1953, became an honorary <b>bencher</b> of the Inner Temple in 1963 and received an honorary LLD from Monash University in 1973. He was also active in the Anglican Church, and for many years was chancellor of the diocese of Melbourne, the highest church office that could be held by a layman. In 1980 he was elected one of the inaugural fellows of Trinity College, Melbourne, under its new constitution.|$|E
5|$|Stevenson {{was elected}} a <b>bencher</b> of the Inner Temple in 1950, and {{appointed}} Recorder of Cambridge, a part-time judge, in 1952; {{he had previously}} served as Recorder for Rye from 1944 to 1951. In 1954 he represented the government of British Kenya during Jomo Kenyatta's unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel Mau Mau; Kenyatta was a moderate, and is now considered unlikely {{to have been a}} member of the organisation. He was imprisoned until 1959, lived under house arrest until 1961, and became the first president of the newly independent Kenya in 1964. Also in 1954 Stevenson represented the Marten family in the Crichel Down affair. The Air Ministry had compulsorily purchased land for bombing practice before the war, promising to return it after the end of hostilities. When they did not honour this promise, the Martens successfully campaigned to be allowed to buy the land back. The case led to a public enquiry, changes in the law on compulsory purchase, and the first resignation of a government minister since 1917.|$|E

50|$|The {{practices}} and regulations vary from Inn to Inn, but the <b>benchers</b> {{are the ultimate}} governing body of the relevant Inn. The <b>benchers</b> govern the finances of the Inn, and they alone {{have the authority to}} admit students, to call students to the Bar, and to elect other <b>benchers.</b> Today, the <b>benchers</b> of the four Inns have common standards agreed with the Bar Council. They have the formal power to discipline members of their Inn by suspending or expelling them from membership of the Inn, and by disbarring them. Disciplinary functions are now shared with the Council of the Inns of Court, the Bar Standards Board and its Complaints Committee (formerly known as the Professional Conduct and Complaints Committee).|$|R

50|$|Inner Temple was {{historically}} {{governed by}} a Treasurer and three Governors. Members {{were divided into two}} categories; Clerks (Clerici) admitted to Clerks' Commons and Fellows Socii admitted to Fellows' Commons. The Governors held Parliament {{with a small group of}} senior barristers; in 1508, for example, Parliament was held with three Governors and four senior barristers. The last Governor was elected in 1566, and <b>Benchers</b> took over later that century. <b>Benchers,</b> or Masters of the Bench, are elected members of the Parliament responsible for overseeing the estates, the Inn's finances and setting internal policy. Today there are approximately 200 governing <b>Benchers</b> (barristers and members of the judiciary) and honorary, academic and Royal <b>Benchers</b> appointed as well as those practising in other jurisdictions.|$|R
