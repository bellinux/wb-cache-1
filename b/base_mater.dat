40|$|Abstract. By {{applying}} biological pedigree concept into product conceptual structure design, an conceptual {{structural design}} approach is set forth to make {{full use of}} creative and innovative intelligence of living systems for design automation. According {{to the relationship between}} different product structures with same function, the classification model of product pedigree is established, which can be used as unified functional isomorphic model during the intelligent conceptual design process. On the other hand, according to the evolutional logic from quality change to quantities change, pedigree based product evolutionary design strategy is given. Product pedigrees which are homology dependent are used as basic evolutionary models, based on which, the parameter based, interaction field <b>based</b> and interaction <b>mater</b> <b>based</b> evolutional conceptual design method are proposed, respectively. Based on the relation network of the pedigree units, multiple variant design schemes can be obtained, which is a strong backbone to the innovative design process. Finally, design examples are used to demonstrate the successful application of the proposed pedigree based evolutionary method in the product variant design...|$|R

He went to the Mater Hospital at 2 pm, nine hours after the raid ended, to find the street with a traffic jam of ambulances waiting to admit their casualties. He spoke with Professor Flynn, (Theodore Thomson Flynn, an Australian <b>based</b> at the <b>Mater</b> Hospital and father of actor Errol Flynn), head of the casualty service for the city, who told him of [...] "casualties due to shock, blast and secondary missiles, such as glass, stones, pieces of piping, etc." [...] O'Sullivan reported: [...] "There were many terrible mutilations among both living and dead - heads crushed, ghastly abdominal and face wounds, penetration by beams, mangled and crushed limbs etc.". His report concluded with: [...] "a second Belfast would be too horrible to contemplate".|$|R
40|$|The third {{millennium}} marks {{the opening of}} a new historical cycle for university education, the new Venezuelan university, which stands {{in the context of the}} Mission Alma <b>Mater,</b> <b>based</b> on a new conception of society, science and technology and professional is required for national and Latin American integration. This third historical cycle of the university consists of momentous changes not only in the fundamentals and principles that define the phenomenology university, but also how these have operated for so long. Therefore arises as the central axis of the article, the need for a new epistemological conception of the university. This paper presents new definitions and ways of responding to this epistemological void, specifically in the transformation of the Colleges and University Institutes of Technology in Regional Polytechnic Universities, a process that is part of the Mission Alma Mater, which constitutes the axis central to the expansion and modernization of the education system and one of the biggest challenges of the Bolivarian government for Venezuela's college education...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{for the objective of}} elucidating the causes of recurrence of spinal meningioma based on the clinical findings and findings of imaging and for the purpose of establishing the surgical principles. The authors studied tendency of recurrence in 53 patients with spinal meningioma who underwent surgical treatment in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of School of Medicine, Chiba University from 1967 to 1997. Ten patients had recurrence, seven of them had tumor in the anterior to anterolateral region of the spinal canal. As for histological classification, recurrence was seen in all three patients who had atypical-type meningioma. As for surgical method, the patients who did not undergo dura resection {{were more likely to have}} recurrence than the patients who underwent dura resection. Then, for the objective of assessing the association of the intradural residue of the tumor with recurrence, histological views of the dura mater in the tumor adhesion site were compared with the preoperative MRI in 17 of 35 patients who underwent dura resection concurrently with tumorectomy. Dural enhancement with Gd-DTPA was found in 13 patients, and dural invasion of the tumor cells was seen in six of them. As for the histopathological findings of the electrically coagulated resected dura mater, one of five patients had residual tumor tissue in the dura <b>mater.</b> <b>Based</b> on the results, it is suggested that total tumorectomy and concomitant dura resection should be performed. 脊髄髄膜腫の臨床像および画像所見から再発の原因を明らかにし手術方針を確立することを目的とした。当科にて手術を行った脊髄髄膜腫 53 例について腫瘍の発生部位や手術法, 組織型の違いによる再発傾向の差および術前のMRI所見と摘出した硬膜の組織像との関連につき検討した。 53 症例のうち 10 例(18. 9 %) に再発例が認められた。再発は腫瘍の発生部位が脊髄前方から前側方部のものが 7 例と多かった。また腫瘍の組織型については, atypical typeの 3 例全例に再発が認められた。また手術において硬膜の非切除群は切除群と比較して有意に再発が多く認められた。以上, 脊髄髄膜腫の再発因子として, 腫瘍の脊髄前方発生, 組織型がatypical type, 硬膜の非切除が考えられた。つぎに硬膜内部に残存した腫瘍の再発への関与を検討するため, 硬膜切除を施行した 35 例中 17 例において腫傷付首部硬膜の組織像と術前MRI所見との関連につき検討を行なった。MRIにてGd-DTPAによる硬膜の造影像が認められたものが 13 例であり, この 13 例中 6 例においては硬膜内部への腫瘍細胞の浸潤が認められた。さらに摘出した硬膜を電気凝固した後の病理所見では, 5 例中 1 例に硬膜内部において腫瘍組織の残存が認められた。再発を防ぐためには脊髄前方部の腫瘍の取り残しに注意し, 硬膜を含めた腫瘍の完全摘出が必要である...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{qualitative}} {{case study of}} African-American philanthropic motivations and fundraising strategies employed to increase African-American alumni giving at a predominantly white institution, Midwestern University. The lack of research and {{lack of understanding of}} African-American alumni motivations and perceptions of philanthropic giving is the problem for this case study. It is the goal of the researcher that the findings and recommendations of this research be considered {{in the development of the}} University’s race specific fundraising strategies. The study included seven personal interviews of the Indiana State University African-American Alumni Board of Directors. Exhaustive field notes were analyzed thematically. Additionally, ex post facto regarding the AAAC Board of Directors was analyzed. Through triangulation, the researcher analyzed the data for commonalities. Commonalities found in the interviews, artifacts, and observations have been reported. This study expands our understanding in general and will assist leadership in expanding philanthropic activity and giving. Engaging and developing fundraising strategies for the untapped resource of the African-American alumni is important, yet the importance and feelings of inclusion to African-American alumni is the theme that emerged above others. The researcher found the African-American alumni are motivated to give to their alma <b>mater</b> <b>based</b> on the positive memories and relationships that were formed during their college experience. The expectation is that their financial support to the University will support the African-American students and staff of the University. As this Midwestern University has made progress, in the creation of the African-American Alumni Council, the researcher found that, the call for authenticity, transparency, and relevancy is essential to the council’s success.

40|$|The use {{and quality}} of {{prediction}} of simulation models depends {{to a great extent}} on the availability of enough input data of good quality. In civil engineering calculations are often made on saturated, unstructured soils. Dikes are mainly situated far above groundwater levels and therefore clay soils in and on dikes are often dry and well structured. This has a major impact on material properties of clay soils. This report presents an inventory of soil physical characteristics as used in agricultural research for use in civil engineering. In Chapter 2 the water retention characteristics and conductivity characteristics of Dutch soils collected in the "Staringreeks" are presented. The water retention characteristic is the relation of soil water content versus soil water suction. The conductivity characteristic is the relation of the soil water suction versus the unsaturated conductivity. The "Staringreeks" is constructed by Alterra, Wageningen UR, the Netherlands, and presents the average water retention and conductivity characteristics of 36 Dutch soil texture classes (Wösten et al., 2001). The series is based on 832 soil horizons. Beside these average soil physical characteristics of the 36 Dutch soil texture classes also continue functions are presented which make it possible to calculate the soil physical characteristics <b>based</b> on organic <b>mater</b> content, clay content, loam content (= clay + silt content), subsoil or topsoil, and bulk density. The water retention and conductivity characteristics of clay soils in the "Staringreeks" are compared with measured characteristics of clay soils of the dike along the river Lek nearby Bergambacht. The soil physical characteristics of the agricultural soils in the "Staringreeks" prove to be different from the measured soil physical characteristics of the clay soils of the dike. Hysteresis of the water retention characteristic is considered. In chapter 3 shrinkage of clay soils is considered. In the unsaturated zone shrinkage and the resulting soil cracks have a crucial role in preferential flow of water and solutes to groundwater. In summer and most time of winter groundwater levels in dikes are far below the upper clay layers of the dike. Therefore usually clay in and on dikes becomes much dryer and structured than clay soils in Dutch agriculture. Consequently shrinkage of clay will be even more important in dikes than in agricultural soils. In chapter 4 conclusions are drawn...|$|R
