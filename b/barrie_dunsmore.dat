50|$|<b>Barrie</b> <b>Dunsmore</b> is a {{journalist}} who covered foreign affairs for ABC News for 30 years. From 1965 to 1995, Dunsmore reported from Washington {{and more than one}} hundred countries on virtually every major international event: from wars, to summits, to the policies of seven U.S. presidents from Johnson to Clinton. From the height of the Cold War until its end, Dunsmore was regularly present when American presidents and Soviet leaders met. He was with Israeli troops when they captured the Suez Canal from Egypt in 1967 and when General Ariel Sharon put the city of Suez under siege in 1973. He was on Henry Kissinger's Middle East Shuttles {{in the aftermath of the}} 1973 war and was with President Jimmy Carter in the Middle East six years later when he finally cemented the historic Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. Dunsmore covered the fall of South Vietnam in1975, conducted the first American television interview with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and was with three former presidents (Nixon, Ford and Carter) who attended Sadat's funeral. He watched SCUD missiles fall on Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War. He had a worldwide scoop on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and he did the first American television report on the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest in 1987.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1988, 20 {{men from}} Beita and Huwara, {{identified}} by a GSS report after clashes with Israeli troops {{to have been}} involved in stone throwing, were assembled, bound, without their resisting, with plastic handcuffs and had their bones broken by soldiers, and then were abandoned at night in a muddy field. The International Red Cross made a formal complaint, after local press reports had been ignored. The army did not prosecute the matter initially. Lieutenant-colonel Yehuda Meir was reprimanded, and forced into retirement, with his officer's rank and pension rights intact. He was prosecuted only after the Association for Civil Rights in Israel made an issue of the matter by appealing to the Supreme Court which ruled that he had to stand trial, which then took place in April 1991. Meir was the local Nablus district commander overseeing the operation, and testified that he had acted under orders directly coming from Yitzhak Rabin and that when he had objected to bone-smashing, Rabin had replied: [...] "You do the work, I'll take care of the media." [...] His superiors testified that orders were only to use force in pursuit and arrests. The court believed the latter and found that the orders were legal, but that Meir had deviated from instructions. On April 6, 1988, 16-20 teenage hikers from Elon Moreh, an Israeli settlement 10 km north of Beita, set out for a trek. Nature-hiking among settlers was a symbolic means of demonstrating their control of the land. [...] They were accompanied by two guards, both with a reputation for being aggressive Zionists: Roman Aldubi, a 26-year-old known extremist and religious militant banned by the IDF from entering Nablus for 6 months, after he had been convicted of obstruction of justice for hiding a gun used by another settler to kill an 11 year old Palestinian child, ‘Aysha Bahash, in her father’s bakery, during a stone-throwing incident. and Menahem Ilan (55), the organizer, who according to Noam Chomsky also had a criminal record, were crossing village land in a show of strength, [...] "to show them that we are the masters of the country", as one of the hikers later told ABC correspondent <b>Barrie</b> <b>Dunsmore.</b> When the settler group sat down to make breakfast near a spring, or a local well, local farmers sowing their spring crops became alarmed at the presence under armed guard, and one of them went to the village, a kilometre away, and the villagers were notified over the mosque’s louspeaker. The village lands were under military closure at the time, and, according to their accounts, they feared, based on other precedents in the area, that the local well might be poisoned. On such walks permission was never asked of villagers, furthermore, to trek through their fields, and Menachem Ilan the leader had not alerted the IDF of his hiking plans in a remote Arab area. Several dozen farmers, among them some teenagers, gathered in proximity of the hikers. [...] What took place was contested at that time.|$|E
