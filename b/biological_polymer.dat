Many biological molecules are polymers: in this terminology, monomers {{are relatively small}} micromolecules that are linked together to create large macromolecules known as polymers. When monomers are linked together to synthesize a <b>biological</b> <b>polymer,</b> they undergo a process called dehydration synthesis.

Protein sequence can be used to predict local features, such as segments of secondary structure, or trans-membrane regions. However, the complexity of protein folding currently prohibits predicting the tertiary {{structure of a}} protein from its sequence alone. Knowing the structure of a similar homologous sequence (for example a member of the same protein family) allows highly accurate prediction of the tertiary structure by homology modeling. If the full-length protein sequence is available, it is possible to estimate its general biophysical properties, such as its isoelectric point.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic instability—the {{switching}} of {{a two-state}} polymer between phases of steady elongation and rapid shortening—is {{essential to the}} cellular function of eukaryotic microtubules, especially during chromosome segregation.

Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we observe that the prokaryotic actin homolog ParM, whose assembly is required for the segregation of large, low–copy number plasmids, displays both dynamic instability and symmetrical, bidirectional polymerization. The dynamic instability of ParM is regulated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis, and filaments are stabilized by a cap of ATP-bound monomers. ParM is not related to tubulin, so its dynamic instability must have arisen by convergent evolution driven by a set of common constraints on polymer-based segregation of DNA.

In the production of naturally-derived materials there will also be batch-to-batch variation in large-scale isolation procedures that cannot be controlled. Some other problems plaguing natural polymers are their inability to support growth across long lesion gaps due to the possibility of collapse, scar formation, and early re-absorption.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{present a}} finite {{difference}} algorithm for integrating the reactive flow model of contractile <b>biological</b> <b>polymer</b> networks {{on a fixed}} Eulerian mesh. We discuss the accuracy and limits of the algorithm. To illustrate {{the application of the}} algorithm, we carry out a family of computations involving an unreactive contractile network contained in a two-dimensional square reaction vessel. By numerical experiments using different values ofthe physical parameters of the model, we find that for this simple sort of system two major dynamical modes of contraction are predicted to occur. There is the squeezing type contraction in which the network contracts to a single small clump with gradual expulsion ofsolution material, and the rending type contraction in which the network tears itself into a number of separate pieces. We find that to a good approximation the transition between the squeezing mode and the rending mode is controlled by a single nondimensional number (the rending number). We discuss the relevance ofthese results for the analysis ofvarious experimental observations...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTransport {{processes}} within <b>biological</b> <b>polymer</b> networks, including mucus and the extracellular matrix, play {{an important}} role in the human body, where they serve as a filter for the exchange of molecules and nanoparticles. Such polymer networks are complex and heterogeneous hydrogel environments that regulate diffusive processes through finely tuned particle-network interactions. In this work, we present experimental and theoretical studies to examine the role of electrostatics on the basic mechanisms governing the diffusion of charged probe molecules inside model polymer networks. Translational diffusion coefficients are determined by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements for probe molecules in uncharged as well as cationic and anionic polymer solutions. We show that particle transport in the charged hydrogels is highly asymmetric, with diffusion slowed down much more by electrostatic attraction than by repulsion, and that the filtering capability of the gel is sensitive to the solution ionic strength. Brownian dynamics simulations of a simple model are used to examine key parameters, including interaction strength and interaction range within the model networks. Simulations, which are in quantitative agreement with our experiments, reveal the charge asymmetry to be due to the sticking of particles at the vertices of the oppositely charged polymer networks...|$|E
40|$|Films of {{collagen}} (CLG) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), PNIPAAm, {{were prepared}} by casting from water solutions. These bioartificial polymeric materials were studied {{to examine the}} influence of PNIPAAm content and glutaraldehyde vapor cross-linking on the thermal and biological stability of CLG. Mixtures, ranging from 20 - 80 wt% CLG composition, were cross-linked through exposure to glutaraldehyde vapors. Thermal and morphological properties of the films, cross-linked or not, were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry, and scanning electron microscopy, {{with the aim of}} evaluating miscibility, thermal stability, and interactions among the constituents. The experimental results indicated that the homopolymers are not thermodynamically compatible. However, there is good evidence that effective interactions, probably due to hydrogen bond formation, takes place between the constituents. These interactions are more evident on the samples that were not cross-linked. DSC studies revealed that PNIPAAm exerts a thermal stabilizing effect on uncross-linked CLG, while the cross-linking with glutaraldehyde affects only the <b>biological</b> <b>polymer,</b> preventing the interactions with PNIPAAm. SEM micrographs of the uncross-linked mixtures showed that the morphology, in all compositions studied, remains similar to the pure collagen.

As a <b>biological</b> <b>polymer</b> with bioactive motifs, gelatinous peptides are promising building blocks. In combination with an anhydride-containing oligomer, a dual-component hydrogel system (cGEL) was established. First, hollow cGEL tubes were fabricated by a continuous dosing and templating process. Conduits were characterized concerning their mechanical strength, in vitro and in vivo degradation and biocompatibility. Second, cGEL was reformulated as injectable shear thinning filler for established NGCs, here tyrosine-derived polycarbonate-based braided conduits. Thereby, the formulation contained the small molecule LM 11 A- 31. The biofunctionalized cGEL filler was assessed regarding building block integration, mechanical properties, in vitro cytotoxicity, and growth permissive effects on human adipose tissue-derived stem cells. A positive in vitro evaluation motivated further application of the filler material in a sciatic nerve defect. Compared to the empty conduit and pristine cGEL, the functionalization performed superior, though the autologous nerve graft remains the gold standard.

Among the available methods for PolyP localization and quantification, a 4 ', 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole(DAPI) -based assay {{has been used for}} visualization of PolyP-rich organelles. Due to differences in DAPI permeability to different compartments and/or PolyP retention after fixation, a general protocol for DAPI-PolyP staining has not yet been established. Here, we tested different protocols for DAPI-PolyP detection in a range of samples with different levels of DAPI permeability, including subcellular fractions, free-living cells and cryosections of fixed tissues. Subcellular fractions of PolyP-rich organelles yielded DAPI-PolyP fluorescence, although those with a complex external layer usually required longer incubation times, previous aldehyde fixation and/or detergent permeabilization. DAPI-PolyP was also detected in cryosections of OCT-embedded tissues analyzed by multi-photon microscopy. In addition, a semi-quantitative fluorimetric analysis of DAPI-stained fractions showed PolyP mobilization in a similar fashion to what has been demonstrated with the use of enzyme-based quantitative protocols. Taken together, our results support the use of DAPI for both PolyP visualization and quantification, although specific steps are suggested as a general guideline for DAPI-PolyP staining in biological samples with different degrees of DAPI and PolyP permeability...|$|E

The elementary impulse responses of the bright field microscope therefore consist of separate absorptive and phase components, precluding general application of linear, conventional deconvolution processing methods to improve image contrast and resolution. However, conventional deconvolution can be applied {{in the case of}} pure phase (or pure absorptive) objects if the corresponding phase (or absorptive) impulse responses of the microscope are known.

Polystyrene nanoparticles and microtubules (<b>biological</b> <b>polymer</b> filaments) serve as the pure phase point and line objects, respectively, that are imaged with high contrast and low noise using standard microscopy plus digital image processing. Our experimental results agree with a proposed model for the response functions, and confirm previous theoretical predictions. Finally, we use the measured phase point-spread function to apply conventional deconvolution on the bright field images of living, unstained bacteria, resulting in improved definition of cell boundaries and sub-cellular features.
