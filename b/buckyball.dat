If white light is used in Young's experiment, the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits, surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity. In addition to continuous electromagnetic radiation, Young's experiment has been performed with individual photons, with electrons, and with <b>buckyball</b> molecules large enough to be seen under an electron microscope.|$|E

For this demonstration they employed a near-field Talbot Lau interferometer.

In 2011, the interference of molecules as heavy as 6910u could be demonstrated in a Kapitza–Dirac–Talbot–Lau interferometer. In 2013, the interference of molecules beyond 10,000u has been demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{these last}} three {{exceptional}} actions have been {{interpreted as an}} example of the ADE classification: these actions correspond to products (as sets, not as groups) of the groups as A4 × Z/5Z, S4 × Z/7Z, and A5 × Z/11Z, where the groups A4, S4 and A5 are the isometry groups of the Platonic solids, and correspond to E6, E7, and E8 under the McKay correspondence. These three exceptional cases are also realized as the geometries of polyhedra (equivalently, tilings of Riemann surfaces), respectively: the compound of five tetrahedra inside the icosahedron (sphere, genus 0), the order 2 biplane (complementary Fano plane) inside the Klein quartic (genus 3), and the order 3 biplane (Paley biplane) inside the <b>buckyball</b> surface (genus 70).|$|E
25|$|Fullerenes {{and carbon}} nanotubes, carbon {{compounds}} with spheroidal and tubular structures, have stimulated much {{research into the}} related field of materials science. The first fullerene was discovered in 1985 by Sir Harold W. Kroto of the United Kingdom and by Richard E. Smalley and Robert F. Curl, Jr., of the United States. Using a laser to vaporize graphite rods {{in an atmosphere of}} helium gas, these chemists and their assistants obtained cagelike molecules composed of 60 carbon atoms (C60) joined together by single and double bonds to form a hollow sphere with 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal faces—a design that resembles a football, or soccer ball. In 1996 the trio was awarded the Nobel Prize for their pioneering efforts. The C60 molecule was named buckminsterfullerene (or, more simply, the <b>buckyball)</b> after the American architect R. Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic dome is constructed on the same structural principles.|$|E

In the 1980s a technique was developed by Richard Smalley and Robert Curl at Rice University, Texas to isolate these substances. They used laser vaporization of a suitable target to produce clusters of atoms. Kroto realized that by using a graphite target, any carbon chains formed could be studied.
