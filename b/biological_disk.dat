40|$|The Autoturb System, a semiautomated {{system for}} {{photometric}} bioassay, {{was used to}} determine cefazolin content. Suitable conditions for the assay using Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 10541 as the indicator organism included a medium pH of 6. 0 to 7. 0 and an incubation time of 3 to 3. 5 h at 36 C. Multiple independent assays of samples from a common batch showed the test to be highly reproducible. Accuracy of the turbidimetric assay was evaluated by comparing data obtained from a chemical (hydroxylamine) and a <b>biological</b> (<b>disk</b> diffusion) assay. The available data show the turbidimetric assay to be a rapid, accurate, and reproducible method for determining the biological activity of cefazolin samples...|$|E
50|$|A {{stainless}} steel cell, full of plastic caps of different dimension, slowly rotates (1-3 rpm) partially submerged inside a tank, {{where there are}} wastewaters to be purified. Plastic caps spontaneously form a bacterial film that progressively presents, at first, heterotrophic bacteria development which are able to nourish of organic carbon pollutants; then the decrease of COD and BOD concentration and then the development of autotrophic bacteria. They belong to the Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter category and {{they are able to}} oxidize ammonium, transforming it into nitrites and nitrates.The cell containing the carriers (caps) can be flooded as needed; in this way the depuration process control is obtained and it can be oriented both to the carbon removal both to the wastewaters denitrification. These plants, like happening for the <b>biological</b> <b>disks,</b> do not need any blower for the bacteria film oxygenation. It's the slow reactor rotation - alternatively submerged into sewage and into atmosphere - to guarantee the adequate oxygen supply for the oxidation aerobically of the sewage made by the biological film attached to the carriers. In this way it is possible to obtain a huge reduction of functioning and operating treatment costs.|$|R
40|$|We {{have been}} {{conducting}} research with Acetobacter xylinium for microbial conversion of sugars to cellulose. A rotating <b>disk</b> <b>biological</b> contactor should lower costs considerably because its production rates {{are greater than}} for the usual method of surface culture. Another major cost saving comes from replacing expensive sugars in the medium with sugars derived from wastes. Extracts of spent grapes from wastes of Portuguese wine factories supply suitable sugars for good production of microbial cellulose...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} exists {{of creating}} wastewater treatment systems with very {{low levels of}} energy consumption for areas with particularly high requirements from the environmental standpoint. One low energy system for small communities capable of meeting effluent standard {{involves the use of}} an Imhoff tank followed by a rotating biological contactor (RBC) and by anothe settling tank. In such a system, the only energy consumption involved is connected with the rotation of the <b>biological</b> contactor <b>disks.</b> This energy requirement can be met by a systme transforming solar energy into electricity by menas of photovoltaic cells. The other phases of treatment involve gravity flow and settling and hence require no further energy, it being possible to harness gravity also for the extraction of sludge to be dried on drying beds. One further advantage of such a unit lies in the reduced environmental impact involved, making an attractive option for use in parks or protected areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors would}} like to thank EPSRC for {{financial}} support on FEG-SEM equipment (EP/F 019580 / 1) and FEI Scios dualbeam microscope (EP/L 017008 / 01). CaCO 3 spherulites were found in the myostracum layer of common limpet shells collected from East Sands, St Andrews, Scotland. Their microstructures were revealed by using powder X- ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis. The formation mechanisms of these spherulites and their morphology evolution were postulated. It was proposed that spherical particles of an inorganic and biological composite formed first. In the centre of each spherical particle was developed a double-layer disk of vaterite crystal sandwiching a <b>biological</b> sheet. The <b>disk</b> crystal supplies a relatively strong mirror symmetric dipole filed, guiding the orientations of the nanocrystallites and the arrangement of mesorods, and therefore, determining the final morphology of the spherulite.

40|$|Rice {{processing}} industry {{is the largest}} agro-based industry in the country turning more value of product than any other industry. Mainly two types of rice called raw and parboiled; famous among the local community. The rice milled from pre-treated paddy is known as parboiled rice. Parboiling is a hydro-thermal treatment followed by drying before milling {{for the production of}} parboiled grains. Nearly 70 percent of the paddy produced in Sri Lanka at present is parboiled. Two dominant wastages are released to environment in parboiled rice milling namely, soak water and paddy husks. For one metric ton of paddy, approximately 1. 3 m 3 of soaked water and 0. 2 tons of paddy husk are released to environment and soaked water is discharged to the environment without being treated. Due to this, bad odour is prevailed in the vicinities of the mills. In addition, paddy husk and ash dumps are washed away with rain to the waterways. To minimize bad smell, millers are advised to change socking every 10 - 12 hours. Even though socking water is changed every 12 hours time COD and BOD 5 levels of releasing water are higher than the values set by CEA. Therefore, sustainability of this industry relies addressing the waste streams in a productive manner. Therefore in this research cleaner production principle is adapted to minimize the waste generated by attacking the point of generation and using potion of treated wastewater for soaking process. Industrial Ecology concept is adapted by using by product (waste) of the process, paddy husk as a fuel initially to operate the boiler and later ash of the husk as filtering media of wastewater. In addition, steam generated by burning paddy husk will be partly used to rotate <b>biological</b> rotating <b>disk</b> which facilitate aerobic reaction. Treatment process consists of two stages and in the first stage, BOD value is reduced by aerobic digestion with the help of rotating biological contractors (RBC) and in the second stage pre-treated wastewater sent through a carbon filter in order to reduce COD. Result shows that treatment process gives promising results of the COD and BOD 5 concentrations of the treated water therefore treated water can be re-used for soaking purposes again...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{recently}} developed copper-mediated photoinduced living radical polymerization (CP-LRP), a novel and well-defined polymeric prodrug of the antimicrobial lipopeptide colistin has been developed. A colistin initiator (Boc 5 -col-Br 2) was synthesized through the modification of colistin {{on both of}} its threonine residues using a cleavable initiator linker, 2 -(2 -bromo- 2 -methylpropanoyloxy) acetic acid (BMPAA), and used for the polymerization of acrylates via CP-LRP. Polymerization proceeds from both sites of the colistin initiator, and through the polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGA 480), three water-soluble polymer-colistin conjugates (col-PPEGA, having degrees of polymerization of 5, 10, and 20) were achieved with high yield (conversion of ≥ 93 %) and narrow dispersities (Đ < 1. 3) in 2 - 4 h. Little or {{no effect on the}} structure and activity of the colistin was observed during the synthesis, and most of the active colistin can be recovered from the conjugates in vitro within 2 days. Furthermore, in vitro <b>biological</b> analyses including <b>disk</b> diffusion, broth microdilution, and time-kill studies suggested that all of the conjugates have the ability to inhibit the growth of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, of which col-PPEGA DP 5 and DP 10 showed similar or better antibacterial performance compared to the clinically relevant colistin prodrug CMS, indicating their potential as an alternative antimicrobial therapy. Moreover, considering the control over the polymerization, the CP-LRP technique has the potential to provide an alternative platform for the development of polymer bioconjugates...|$|R
