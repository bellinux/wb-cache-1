5000|$|The {{first patent}} for a ballpoint pen was issued on 30 October 1888, to John J. Loud, who was {{attempting}} to make a writing instrument that {{would be able to}} write [...] "on rough surfaces-such as wood, coarse wrapping-paper, and other articles" [...] which then-common fountain pens could not. Loud's pen had a small rotating steel ball, held in place by a socket. Although it could be used to mark rough surfaces such as leather, as Loud intended, it proved to be too coarse for letter-writing. With no commercial viability, its potential went unexploited and the patent eventually lapsed.The manufacture of economical, reliable ballpoint pens as we know them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{components}} subjected to contact stress as local compressive stress {{is important in}} engineering application especially in <b>ball</b> and <b>socket</b> Joining. Two kinds of contact stress are introduced in the <b>ball</b> and <b>socket</b> joint, the first is from normal contact while the other is from sliding contact. Although joining two long links (drive shaft in steering cars) will cause the effect of flexural and tensional buckling stress in hollow columns through the <b>ball</b> and <b>socket</b> ends on the failure condition of the joining mechanism. In this paper the consideration of the combined effect of buckling Load and contact stress on the <b>ball</b> and <b>socket</b> joints have been taken, epically on the stress distribution in the contact area. Different parameters have been taken {{in the design of}} joint. This is done by changing the angles for applied loads with the principle axis, the angle of contact between <b>ball</b> and <b>socket</b> and using different applied loads. The problem has been solved using analytical solution for computing the critical loads and using these loads for calculating the stress distribution with finite element method using ANSYS 10. The numerical results have been compared with the experimental method using photo elasticity pattern which shows good agreement between experimental and simulation results...|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, many {{aircraft}} were {{equipped with}} flexible (aimable, {{as opposed to}} fixed) machine guns and cannon for protection against other aircraft. The most common and basic of these was the rear gun or [...] "tail gun", to cover the upper-rear arc of fire. In its basic form, this was a second crew member behind the pilot with a single machine gun, as was seen all through WWI and onward; more complex aircraft might have a gunner located in the actual tail of the aircraft, giving a wider arc of fire and freeing them from the danger of hitting their own tail surfaces. Rear guns {{could be found in}} aircraft of many different sizes and types. The nose gun was perhaps the second most common position, although almost exclusively used in multi-engine aircraft, due to the difficulty in firing a flexible gun through the propeller arc or fitting a nose gun position at all with an engine filling the nose area. Twin engine aircraft were ideal for fitting a defensive nose gun, especially since many already had a bombardier (bomb-aimer) located in the nose area. These could range from a simple machine gun on a <b>ball</b> <b>socket</b> in the glazing of the cockpit windscreen (Ju 88), or similar mountings in the nose glazing (early B-17, B-24, G4M, Ki-48, Halifax, etc.), up to power operated manned turrets (late B-24, Avro Lancaster, Vickers Wellington), or even basic remotely controlled turrets such as seen on late B-17's, and more complex ones such as those used on the He 177 and the B-29 (which had a gun-aiming sight, but no actual guns in the nose).|$|E
40|$|A new {{wireless}} power transfer (WPT) system based on ball-joint structure is presented in this paper. A ball-joint WPT system consists of a ball structure with a mechanical rod attached to the ball and a <b>ball</b> <b>socket</b> that accommodates the ball structure. This ball-joint structure comprises at least one winding in the ball structure {{and at least one}} winding in the <b>ball</b> <b>socket</b> structure. The ball structure can be flexibly rotated over a wide range of angle inside the <b>ball</b> <b>socket,</b> while {{wireless power}} can still be transferred from the transmitter winding to the receiver winding through magnetic resonance. The magnetic coupling coefficient between the transmitter and receiver coil over a wide rotating angular range has been analyzed and experimentally checked. Experimental results confirm that an energy efficiency of up to 81 % can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt is very {{important}} to maintain the stability of pump pressure in water mist system for higher fire suppression efficiency. In recent years, the optimization of design of the multi-plunger pump to reduce the pulsation of output pressure is an urgent problem to be solved. In the present study, the flow pulsation and frequency characteristics of multi-plunger canted disc link pump were simulated based on the kinematical equations. The kinetic characteristics of this type of pump were expounded through the calculation results. The effects of plunger number, canted disc dip angle, rotate speed, diameter and location of <b>ball</b> <b>socket</b> reference circle on the flow pulsation and frequency characteristic of the pump were also studied...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} stress patterns generated within implant-supported mandibular overdentures retained by two different attachment types: <b>ball</b> and <b>socket</b> and locator attachments. Materials and methods: Commercial CAD/CAM and {{finite element analysis}} software packages were utilized to construct two 3 D finite element models for the two attachment types. Unilateral masticatory compressive loads of 50, 100, and 150  N were applied vertically to the overdentures, parallel to the longitudinal axes of the implants. Loads were directed toward the central fossa in the molar region of each overdenture, that linear static analysis was carried out to find the generated stresses and deformation on {{each part of the}} studied model. Results: According to FEA results the ball attachment neck is highly stressed in comparison to the locator one. On the other hand mucosa and cortical bone received less stresses under <b>ball</b> and <b>socket</b> attachment. Conclusions: Locator and <b>ball</b> and <b>socket</b> attachments induce equivalent stresses on bone surrounding implants. Locator attachment performance was superior to that of the <b>ball</b> and <b>socket</b> attachment in the implants, nylon caps, and overdenture. Locator attachments are highly recommended and can increase the interval between successive maintenance sessions...|$|R
