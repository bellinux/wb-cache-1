50|$|The {{stability}} of Herons was demonstrated in South Australia on 26 January 1995. Forty-four yachts competing {{in a state}} title heat being held at the Largs Bay Sailing Club were struck by a violent thunder squall that lashed and wreaked widespread destruction across the city of Adelaide and surrounding districts. Winds speeds were reported in excess of sixty knots. Although almost all yachts capsized immediately, two of the fleet remained upright and were surfed into shore, having had their masts broken before capsize could occur. 'Hot Eclipse' (sail no. 9299, skipper Gareth Eastwood) was at a point adjacent the windward jibe <b>buoy</b> <b>around</b> two kilometers offshore when the gale struck. It was manhandled to shore atop waves around four meters high, with the forward crew leaning across the front deck holding the sails down. The wild ride to safety lasted about an hour. Few small sailing dinghy designs could have managed this.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} {{explained in}} this paper was carried out to analyze and design a point absorber wave energy convertor for Assaluyeh coastal on Persian Gulf. The geographical conditions of this region have some local short waves which may be ideal to use this type of energy convertor. According to the collecting of wave data and using an optimized buoy, it is concluded that the adjustments on damping and natural frequency have more effect on average heave displacement. Therefore, by changing the shape of flat buoy to conical cylindrical, the drag coefficient that has direct effect on the damping of the buoy could be reduced. Regarding the length to diameter ratio of 1. 7 for the selected buoy, changing its shape from flat cylinder to conical cylinder causes the drag coefficient to decrease by 50 %, which is followed by 20 % increase in average amplitude of heave motion from 0. 524 - 0. 625 m. This increase in average amplitude heave is efficacious in increase power <b>buoy</b> <b>around</b> 45 watts.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to report on a {{possible}} correlation between the Lévy index for the wind velocity and the mean Energy Density of sea surface waves in the same location. The result is based on data obtained from six <b>buoys</b> located <b>around</b> the coast of Ireland and maintained by the Marine Institute of Ireland. These buoys provide signals on the wind velocity, wave height and wave period as well as other data on an hourly interval. Using this data, we consider the relationship between a stochastic model for the time variations in wave height that, in turn, is based on a non-Gaussian model for the wind force characterized by the Lévy index. Although the results presented in this paper can not be said to statistically significant due to the limited amount of data that is available (i. e. the Marine Institute of Ireland only maintains six <b>buoys</b> <b>around</b> the coast of Ireland) they indicate the possibility of developing a method of accurately estimating the energy and power densities of sea waves from knowledge of the wind velocity alone...|$|R

5000|$|The Mexican {{authorities}} have outlined several plans {{to undo the}} damage done to the beaches and the islands. These will focus not only repairing the damage already caused by human hands, but will also focus on mitigating any further human interference in the ecosystem. The first part of the plan is to [...] "replant" [...] the coral in order to compensate for the coral that has been destroyed. This is done by attaching new coral to the already existing coral and letting it grow for 3 to 4 months. Another major effort focuses on limiting the damaging human impact on the sanctuary when the islands reopen for the general public and tourists. According to National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) after the Islands have been reopened for tourism tourist overload may be mitigated by placing a special floating dock in the bay area which will limit the ships that arrive. another measure under consideration is to place <b>buoys</b> <b>around</b> the fragile ecosystem in order to control the number of visitors that are arriving.|$|R

40|$|The complex {{wave climate}} of Hawaii {{includes}} {{a mix of}} seasonal swells and wind waves from all directions across the Pacific. Numerical hindcasting from surface winds provides essential space-time information to complement buoy and satellite observations for studies of the marine environment. We utilize WAVEWATCH III and SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) in a nested grid system to model basin-wide processes as well as high-resolution wave conditions around the Hawaiian Islands from 1979 to 2013. The wind forcing includes the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) for the globe and downscaled regional winds from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Long-term in-situ buoy measurements and remotely-sensed wind speeds and wave heights allow thorough assessment of the modeling approach and the data products for practical application. The high-resolution WRF winds, which include orographic and land-surface effects, are validated with QuickSCAT observations from 2000 to 2009. The wave hindcast reproduces the spatial patterns of swell and wind wave events detected by altimeters on multiple platforms between 1991 and 2009 {{as well as the}} seasonal variations recorded at 16 offshore and nearshore <b>buoys</b> <b>around</b> the Hawaiian Islands from 1979 to 2013.

Whereas the classical geometrical optics approximation predicts an abrupt transition from complete transmission at small incidence angles to no transmission at large angles, the full model predicts a more gradual transition with partial reflection/transmission that is sensitive to the canyon geometry and controlled by evanescent modes for small incidence angles and relatively short waves.

40|$|A wave hindcast in the Western Mediterranean Sea {{is carried}} out {{in order to assess}} the {{performance}} of three atmospheric models in providing the forcing for a third generation wave model. The wind models have been used as forcing fields for the generation of waves and the resulting significant wave height time history compared with four <b>buoys</b> <b>around</b> the Balearic Islands. Two different wave-model grid resolutions are used to get the wave field in the entire Mediterranean and around the Balearic Islands. The present application was performed for three months: November 2008 and for July and August 2009. Results indicate that all data sources provide good forcing for operational wave forecast at large scales (wind forecast with grid resolution of 30 and 25. km). Near the coast or at the lee of islands, resolving small scale topographical features result in a better forecast of wave fields. However, for the area studied, the atmospheric model that better represents summer and winter conditions is hourly WRF at 1. 5. km resolution. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The three reanalysis datasets show good agreement with the observed data and with each other. Slopes of the least-squares line to scatter plots of reanalysis data versus observational data show small differences between the three reanalyses, with ERA- 40, ERA-Interim and NNRP- 1 slopes ranging between (0. 79 – 1. 06) ± 0. 01, (0. 83 – 1. 01) ± 0. 01 and (0. 76 – 0. 98) ± 0. 01, respectively. Summary statistics and the monthly mean temperatures over the 1989 – 2001 period showed that the reanalyses were significantly warmer in winter than the observations, which resulted in best fit lines with slopes consistently less than unity. ERA-Interim was slightly better than both ERA- 40 and NNRP- 1 at modelling winter temperatures and it had higher correlation coefficients with the observations. All three reanalyses use different grid sizes and types. Subsequent regridding of the ERA-Interim and NNRP- 1 data to the ERA- 40 grid showed that the grid difference had no significant influence on the results. Comparison of ERA-Interim and NNRP- 1 data with the air temperatures at four marine <b>buoys</b> <b>around</b> the Irish coast for the period 2001 – 2005 showed that the reanalyses modelled colder winter temperatures than the observations; resulting in best fit lines with slopes consistently greater than unity.

40|$|Understanding {{the changes}} in future storm wave climate is crucial for coastal {{managers}} and planners {{to make informed decisions}} required for sustainable coastal management and for the renewable energy industry. To investigate potential future changes to storm climate around the UK, global wave model outputs of two time slice experiments were analysed with 1979 – 2009 representing present conditions and 2075 – 2100 representing the future climate. Three WaveNet <b>buoy</b> sites <b>around</b> the United Kingdom, which represent diverse site conditions and have long datasets, were chosen for this study. A storm event definition (Dissanayake et al., 2015) was used to separate meteorologically-independent storm events from wave data, which in turn allowed storm wave characteristics to be analysed. Model outputs were validated through a comparison of the modelled storm data with observed storm data for overlapping periods. Although no consistent trends across all future clusters were observed, there were no significant increases in storm wave height, storm count or storm power in the future, at least according to the global wave projection results provided by the chosen model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{demand for}} {{reliable}} information on wave conditions, in particular at coastal sites, is increasing {{as a result}} of the increased utilisation of the coastal zone to a multitude of activities (e. g. shoreline developments related to transportation, oil and gas industries, wave energy industries, etc). Reliable data is also needed with respect to the management and protection of these, often fragile, environments. Many of those concerned with these wave-impacted environments still use antiquated data sources, usually from offshore waters as, in the absence of long term wave data collected at the site of interest, the calculation of reliable wave statistics at a coastal site is a complicated, time consuming and expensive business, requiring various data sets to be assembled. WorldWaves considerably simplifies the modelling of wave conditions in coastal waters, resulting in more timely data, at a lower cost and at the same time retaining a high reliability. In this paper, we describe the development of WorldWaves. The offshore wave database is described in some detail, including the validation of the long-term model data against satellite and <b>buoy</b> data <b>around</b> the world.
