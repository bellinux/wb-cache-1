5|$|The first festival {{was held}} in 1974, {{organised}} by Royce Creasey and friends, as a small event, for the local musicians to entertain the local community. The first festival took place over four successive weekends with bands playing from a stage improvised from a flat <b>bed</b> <b>truck.</b> Bristol City Council donated £50. The following year the festival took place over one weekend and was located near to Ashton Court mansion. After this, new organisers came on board and fund-raising gigs were held enabling the event to grow steadily through the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|EATS {{technology}} is predominately used when applying vehicle tracking to vehicle security solutions. [...] An {{example of this}} distinction is given in the following scenario; [...] A construction company owns some pieces of plant machinery that are regularly left unattended, at weekends, on building sites. Thieves break onto one site and a piece equipment, such as a digger, is loaded {{on the back of}} a flat <b>bed</b> <b>truck</b> and then driven away. [...] Typically the ignition wouldn’t need to be turned on and as such most of the AVL products available wouldn’t typically be activated. Only products that included a unit that was activated by a motion sensor or GeoFence alarm event, would be activated.|$|E

In 1988 she co-founded the comedy troupe Latins Anonymous {{as a response to the}} Hollywood stereotyping of Latino actors.|$|R

The Honcho package was only available on the sportside (stepside) and short <b>bed</b> <b>trucks.</b> Between 1980 and 1983, only 1,264 of the sportside versions were produced.|$|R

5000|$|Polyurethane can be sprayed from 1/16 inch to 4 inches, {{depending}} on the application. Thinner coatings may cost less but can chip and crack. Thicker coatings destroy the shape {{and size of the}} <b>truck</b> <b>bed.</b> For <b>trucks</b> with the most rugged use, ArmorThane sets optimum thickness for bedliners as 1/4 inch on the bed and wheel wells and 1/8 inch on the sides.|$|R

5000|$|Independence Air also {{invested}} in a fleet of 20 promotional vehicles, dubbed [...] "Jet Trucks". Modified pickup trucks were painted in the airline's livery and featured an aircraft tail attached to the <b>truck's</b> <b>bed.</b> Jet <b>Trucks</b> were featured at all promotional events and activities, where employees would hand out information and branded giveaways. Rather than having these vehicles sit in the headquarters office parking lot between events, 10 trucks were allocated for employee use to increase public exposure.|$|R
50|$|Pau de Arara is a {{designation}} {{given in}} the Northeast Brazil to a flat <b>bed</b> <b>truck</b> adapted for passenger transportation. The truck's bed is equipped with narrow wooden benches and a canvas canopy.

50|$|The {{music video}} for this song was filmed in New York City.

50|$|A long-bed {{truck is}} {{best suited for}} most campers. It is very {{important}} that the center of gravity of a truck camper be located forward of the rear axle. This is far easier to accomplish with a long <b>bed</b> <b>truck.</b> Some manufacturers do produce campers specifically for short bed trucks or at least interchangeable with long beds.|$|E

5000|$|A Skid Unit (called a [...] "Slip-on" [...] in Australia) is {{the common}} name {{used to refer to}} a {{complete}} self-contained fire fighting apparatus designed for use on/in commercially available vehicle platforms. Vehicles such as pickup <b>trucks,</b> flat <b>bed</b> <b>trucks,</b> vans, off-road vehicles, trailers and others can easily be fitted with a proper size skid unit for a variety of fire fighting operations. There is virtually no limit to size or performance capabilities. Fire operations can include rural field operations, forest fires, brush fires and other situations in which a small, highly mobile vehicle is necessary to reach the location of the fire ground operations in rough or otherwise inaccessible terrain.|$|R

5000|$|Pau de Arara is a Portuguese {{term that}} {{literally}} translates to [...] "macaw's perch". The term originates from {{the habit of}} tying birds to a pole for sale, where they also hang for transportation. By analogy, the term has gained two distinct meanings: it can refer to an irregular flat <b>bed</b> <b>truck</b> used to transport migrant workers and to a torture device developed during the Brazilian military dictatorship.|$|E
50|$|With {{both types}} of jacking systems {{described}} here wood beams called cribs, cribbing or box cribs are stacked into piles to support both the structure and the jacks as the structure is lifted in increments. Once the structure is at a sufficient height, a flat <b>bed</b> <b>truck</b> or hydraulic dollies are placed under the steel framework to support moves to the final destination. After the move the structure is lowered reversing the steps just applied.|$|E

50|$|A common {{misconception}} about cranberry {{production is}} that the beds remain flooded throughout the year. During the growing season cranberry beds are not flooded, but are irrigated regularly to maintain soil moisture. Beds are flooded in the autumn to facilitate harvest and again during the winter to protect against low temperatures. In cold climates like Wisconsin, New England, and eastern Canada, the winter flood typically freezes into ice, while in warmer climates the water remains liquid. When ice forms on the <b>beds,</b> <b>trucks</b> can be driven onto the ice to spread {{a thin layer of}} sand that helps to control pests and rejuvenate the vines. Sanding is done every three to five years.|$|R
50|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was shot during The Wildhearts stint in New York City. It {{features}} the band (at the time just a three piece following CJ's departure from the band) riding through New York {{on the back of}} a flat <b>bed</b> <b>truck</b> interspersed with shots of the band playing in a room dressed in Victorian costume. Ginger can be seen playing a guitar in the shape of the band's Smileybones logo in the New York shots.|$|E
50|$|One notable {{example was}} a Ford F-500 flat <b>bed</b> <b>truck</b> {{made in the}} mid-1960s. Proportions were {{realistic}} and colors were authentic looking. The grille was also authentically detailed with jeweled headlights. Wheels were done in a utilitarian black, detailed, but with no chrome. Rear wheels were 'duallies'. One model offered a dark green body, brown interior, and a red metal chassis. It was a heavy model of a heavy duty real truck (Ragan 2000, p. 36).|$|E
50|$|The Quadraphonic {{presentation}} of Ladies and Gentlemen... required a 44 JBL driver sound system (four systems were built {{and used by}} Dragonaire in its road show performances of the film). Each sound system was capable of generating 3300 Watts RMS, and was transported to each venue in a 14 ft. <b>bed</b> <b>truck.</b> Played at 100 dbA in evening and midnight performances, the sound track had to be mixed by a sound engineer {{based on the number}} of people in the audience in order to achieve optimal clarity. Sound engineers accompanied the road show presentations.|$|E

50|$|Truck tents are {{basically}} conventional 2-3 person tents that are rigged {{to hook up}} to a <b>truck</b> <b>bed.</b> Most <b>truck</b> tents are designed with {{a particular type of}} truck in mind, or a truck with certain features — those with dropgates, liftgates, camper tops, short beds, or long beds, etc. The tents either hook in or strap in to several locations around the truck. The initial set up may take some time, but is fairly simple after one or two attempts. Once the tent is fitted to a specific truck, setting up is as easy as setting up traditional tent. Many proponents choose to put a mattress in the <b>bed</b> of the <b>truck</b> for a more comfortable experience. These mattresses are available in various sizes to fit all trucks. A zip up window provides access to the cab for trucks that have a rear window.|$|R
