50|$|Frontlights are {{relatively}} uncommon. Electroluminescent lights present a reflective surface when turned off. This {{allows for a}} <b>backlit</b> <b>display</b> which {{can also be used}} with ambient light. Such backlights are popular in digital watches. The monochromatic light from an electroluminescent source does not work well with color displays, however. An incandescent frontlight was therefore a popular accessory for the Nintendo Game Boy Color.|$|E

25|$|The Zen Touch has {{a smaller}} form factor and larger <b>backlit</b> blue <b>display</b> in a curved {{industrial}} design. In addition, the device uses a touch-sensitive vertical strip {{on the front}} of the unit for easier file navigation. These changes were enabled by the use of Hitachi's smaller 1.8-inch hard drives. The Touch is available in capacities of 20 and 40GB. Unlike the previous two generations, the Zen Touch does not have a removable battery, and plays audio for approximately 24 hours. Even though the battery is not removable, it can be replaced rather easily since the case is closed with screws only and the battery attaches with a connector.|$|R
