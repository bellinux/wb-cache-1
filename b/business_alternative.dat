40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} the growing trend of developing and managing photovoltaic facilities owned by third parties in buildings, as a possible alternative to energy performance contracting. Design/methodology/approach: Based on an established business model template, analysis is carried out on the framework of using third-party finance in the provision of photovoltaic facilities in buildings. Case studies in the USA and China enable comparison of policy tools enabling this approach. Findings: While barriers exist in the common energy performance contracting approach for renewable installations owned by the building owner, vesting photovoltaic equipment with a third party for a certain period has become a viable <b>business</b> <b>alternative</b> as long as revenue is generated through a power purchase agreement or lease arrangement with the building owner. Research limitations/implications: The third-party ownership business model works better if sufficient policy incentives exist alongside the revenue brought about by renewable energy. Hence, governments have to create the right environment. Originality/value: Win-win situations have been identified through case studies in countries with burgeoning renewable energy use in buildings, notably the USA and China, giving new insights on facilities management.

40|$|In {{recognition}} of the growing importance of small business ownership by women to the economic well-being of national economies, considerable academic {{attention has been given}} to identifying the reasons why women enter self-employment. However, {{little is known about the}} motivations for women to become franchisors. This represents an important gap in the literature. While the absence of research may be due to early beliefs that women are risk averse individuals that tend to limit the growth of their enterprises, more recent studies conclude that women perceive small business ownership as a vehicle for rapid growth and wealth creation. On this basis, franchising should represent an appealing business expansion strategy as it minimizes capital, labor, and managerial limitations on firm growth. However Australian female participation rates in franchising are substantially lower than in small business generally. The purpose of this research is to provide a clearer understanding of the motivational incentives driving the choice of franchising as a business development strategy from the female entrepreneur’s perspective. It was felt important to use a qualitative, case study approach, to get a clearer picture of the main issues and parameters. Twenty-four female franchisors were interviewed to gather data on the salient factors influencing their initial decision to adopt franchising. In addition, 20 female entrepreneurs were interviewed. Significant differences were found between the influence of antecedent factors and motivational incentives of women entering franchising and small business, suggesting that changes in public policy initiatives are required to en-courage greater acceptance of women as franchisors, build awareness of franchising as a small <b>business</b> <b>alternative</b> for women, and provide accessible information and training for women on how to become franchisors. 30 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This project {{tries to}} answers how the present Danish {{government}} (spring 2013) continues {{the same political}} line as the previous right-wing government under Lars Løkke Rasmussen did. The approach is an critical discourse analysis inspired by Norman Fairclough. The answer is, that they continues the political line by adopting the same narrative about the crisis as the old government used. The story is a discourse about globalization focussed on the danish competitiveness. A poor competitiveness {{is linked to the}} high unemployment and low private investment. The bad competitiveness is produced rhetorically as an abstract, agentless and timeless power that threatens Danish companies. Along with a framing of the Danish taxes as burdens for businesses, the problem becomes political - it’s the businesses that create jobs for the country. Behind the discourse lies a doxa of responsible economic policy that demands governments to take care of <b>business.</b> <b>Alternative</b> political discourses are averted by this doxa but also through rhetorical. Lower taxes is the only option. There is no alternatives - as Margaret Thatcher would have put it. The globalizationdiscourse dictates the political actions. The globalizationdiscourse in Denmark {{has been a long time}} on its way. In the 1990 s, globalization was seen as something positive, but the perception of its effects changed to something, that had to be diverted by following a trend of lower corporation taxes. The discourse can be traced back to the Democratic Leadership Council, which was a political group of centrist and conservative democrats who wanted a political strategy that moved beyond the old left-right debate. They coined a political strategy which in time ended up as a way of seeing globalization - a discourse. This discourse spread through international agencies, in which it became a dominant discourse. They then played a big role in diffusing the discourse. We seek to explain how this discourse and this view of the crisis became hegemonic with the roles of structures and changes. These structures are the capitalist mode of production, the Danish welfare state focus on social investment and then finally the crisis of 2008, which opened up a discursive battleground, with the business as a major player...|$|E
