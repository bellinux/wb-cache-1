5|$|NBC ran three BOCs, in Burbank, California, Chicago, and New York City, {{with the}} last the largest. Cline was {{stationed}} at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before satellite transmission, programming was transmitted by coaxial cable line, {{with the cooperation of}} the telephone company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone wire to a switching station west of Chicago near the Mississippi River. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for Heidi, after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the Heidi feed from New York would <b>begin.</b> <b>This</b> placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.|$|E
5|$|Use {{of the era}} {{name was}} {{formally}} adopted {{during the reign of}} Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC), yet its origins can be traced back further. The oldest method of recording years—which had existed since the Shang—set the first year of a ruler's reign as year one. When an emperor died, the first year of a new reign period would <b>begin.</b> <b>This</b> system was changed by the 4th century BC when the first year of a new reign period did not begin until {{the first day of the}} lunar New Year following a ruler's death. When Duke Huiwen of Qin assumed the title of king in 324 BC, he changed the year count of his reign back to the first year. For his newly adopted calendar established in 163 BC, Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157 BC) also set the year count of his reign back to the beginning.|$|E

25|$|The castle {{was in a}} {{bad shape}} {{after the war and}} it took until 1654 before a {{restoration}} and reconstruction would <b>begin.</b> <b>This</b> time, the castle was to be turned into a baroque palace. Charles X Gustav was the king who ordered this, and Nicodemus Tessin the Elder was the architect engaged to fulfill the king's wishes. When Charles Gustaf died in 1660, the construction stopped, only to be restarted at a slow pace during the reigns of King Charles XI and King Charles XII. In 1709, the construction was finally completed.|$|E
25|$|After two or {{more weeks}} if the {{symptoms}} have reduced considerably or gone {{for at least five}} days then challenge testing can <b>begin.</b> <b>This</b> can be carried out with selected foods containing only one food chemical, to isolate it if reactions occur. In Australia, purified food chemicals in capsule form are available to doctors for patient testing. These are often combined with placebo capsules for control purposes. This type of challenge is more definitive. New challenges should only be given after 48 hours if no reactions occur or after five days of no symptoms if reactions occur.|$|E
25|$|On June 9, 2007, {{a tanker}} fire {{occurred}} on SR8 when a tanker truck with 10,000 gallons of fuel collided with another vehicle {{and started a}} fire.

During the Winter 2007 storm, a slope that held up SR8 was eroded by floodwaters. The slope, located on SR8 west of the US101 interchange, and is scheduled to <b>begin</b> <b>this</b> season and last 2 months. In 2010, WSDOT aims to rebuild the columns that support the SR8/US101 interchange and reduce the risk of failure in an earthquake, such as the 2001 Nisqually earthquake.|$|E

Shortly before he was to <b>begin</b> <b>this</b> series, the devastating 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake hit Taiwan on September 21 which measured 7.6 on the MMS scale. Walker's performances became benefit concerts, instead helping {{to raise money for}} disaster relief between October, 1999 and February, 2000. A recital by Walker, originally intended {{to be part of the}} 50th anniversary celebration of Taiwan's current government, was transformed into a memorial service for the earthquake's victims. His recital at National Concert Hall in Taipei in March, 2013 marked his 14th concert journey to Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|Many United Order {{communities}} {{were set up}} amongst Mormon towns beginning in 1874. One in particular was the United Order of Kanab, which was a communal experiment initiated by Brigham Young. Kanab was established in 1870. That year, John R. Young and the local bishop, Levi Stewart, began colonization of this area and twelve families followed to <b>begin</b> <b>this</b> endeavor. However, there was confusion as to who {{was the leader of}} this society. LDS Church authorities appointed the bishop and only they could revoke his status. But many wanted to elect John R. Young as president because he was related to LDS Church president Brigham Young. This conflict of power lasted until January 5, 1875, when Levi Stewart became the president. Eventually, Stewart resigned from his position and L. John Nuttall of Provo took his place.|$|E
25|$|Another {{milestone}} privilege came in 1374 when Louis I of Hungary {{issued the}} Privilege of Koszyce, {{under which the}} king promised not to levy any taxes without agreement from the szlachta. From this, the nobles derived considerable leverage in their future dealings with the monarchy. Louis also promised to pay the ransom for any nobles taken into captivity during wars abroad, and promised that the nobles {{would not have to}} aid in construction of castles unless they gave prior agreement for such a project to <b>begin.</b> <b>This</b> privilege also stated that the king had a duty to ensure that the country did not lose any territories, and regulated some issues related to the posting of officials. Finally, the king promised that the office of starosta would only be given to Poles, and that the offices of a given province (ziemia) would only be given to the local nobles.|$|E

25|$|The {{frequent}} ejection {{of the ice}} giant encountering Jupiter has led David Nesvorný {{and others}} to hypothesize an early Solar System with five giant planets, {{one of which was}} ejected during the instability. In a recent work this five-planet Nice model begins with the giant planets in a 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 resonant chain with a planetesimal disk orbiting beyond them. Following the breaking of the resonant chain Neptune first migrates outward into the planetesimal disk reaching 28 AU before encounters between planets <b>begin.</b> <b>This</b> initial migration reduces the mass of the outer disk enabling Jupiter's eccentricity to be preserved and produces a Kuiper belt with an inclination distribution that matches observations if 20 Earth-masses remained in the planetesimal disk when that migration began. Neptune's eccentricity can remain small during the instability since it only encounters the ejected ice giant, allowing an in situ cold-classical belt to be preserved. The lower mass planetesimal belt in combination with the excitation of inclinations and eccentricities by the Pluto-massed objects also significantly reduce the loss of ice by Saturn's inner moons. The combination of a late breaking of the resonance chain and a migration of Neptune to 28 AU before the instability is unlikely with the Nice 2 model. This gap may be bridged by a slow dust-driven migration over several million years following an early escape from resonance.|$|E

500|$|Flower {{longevity}} {{varies by}} species and conditions, ranging from 5–20 days. After flowering leaf and root senescence sets in, {{and the plant}} appears to be 'dormant' till the next spring, conserving moisture. However the dormant period {{is also one of}} considerable activity within the bulb primordia. It is also a period during which the plant bulb may be susceptible to predators (see Pests and diseases below). Like many bulb plants from temperate regions, a period of exposure to cold is necessary before spring growth can <b>begin.</b> <b>This</b> protects the plant from growth during winter when intense cold may damage it. Warmer spring temperatures then initiate growth from the bulb. Early spring growth confers a number of advantages, including relative lack of competition for pollinators, and lack of deciduous shading. [...] The exception to requiring cold temperatures to initiate flowering is N. tazetta.|$|E

500|$|The formal {{contract}} was dated October 29, signed by Spreckels as agent for Hawaii, and by San Francisco Mint Superintendent E. F. Burton.

The Hawaiian government made {{the change from}} 12 cent pieces to dimes because it was negotiating a monetary convention with the United States and wanted its coins to conform to America's, though this convention never went into force.
