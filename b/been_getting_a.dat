We make our truth for our visible purposes as we go along, and if it does not work we make it afresh. We see life once more as gallant experiment.

A faint glow was in his cheeks, and his eyes were brighter. His manner, too, to Lady May pleased her more. He had ridden home with her; from their conversation, they seemed to have been together almost all day; and there seemed to be a spirit of bon comeradie between the two, as they talked over their doings, which certainly pointed to a good understanding. Altogether Mrs. de Vaux was pleased and hopeful.|$|E

I have this moment received a Letter from Mr. Brown, dated Dunvegan Castle, Island of Skye. He is very well in health and spirits. My new publication has been out for some days and I have directed a Copy to be bound for you, which you will receive shortly. No one can regret Mr. Hodgkinson's ill fortune: I must own illness has not made such a Saint of me as to prevent my rejoicing at his reverse. Keep yourself in as good hopes as possible; in case my illness should continue an unreasonable time many of my friends would I trust for my sake do all in their power to console and amuse you, at the least word from me--You may depend upon it that in case my strength returns I will do all in my power to extricate you from the Abbeys.

I have a few Scotch pebbles for you from the Island of Icolmkill--I am afraid they are rather shabby--I did not go near the Mountain of Cairn Gorm. I do not know the Name of George's ship--the Name of the Port he has gone to is Philadelphia whence he will travel to the Settlement across the Country--I will tell you all about this when I see you. The Title of my last Book is Endymion--you shall have one soon.--I would not advise you to play on the Flageolet--however I will get you one if you please. I will speak to Mr. Abbey on what you say concerning school. I am sorry for your poor Canary. You shall have another volume of my first Book.
