[...] "The sailor Nagorny, who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch, passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms, behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings. I tried to get out, but was roughly pushed back into the carriage by the sentry. I came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling to drag a heavy brown valise.

500|$|At Tobolsk, she and {{her sisters}} sewed jewels into their {{clothing}} in hopes of hiding them from their captors, since Alexandra had written to warn them that she, Nicholas and Maria had been searched upon arriving in Yekaterinburg, and had items confiscated. Their mother used predetermined code words [...] "medicines" [...] and [...] "Sednev's belongings" [...] for the jewels. Letters from Demidova to Tegleva gave the instructions. Pierre Gilliard recalled his last sight of the children at Yekaterinburg: [...] "The sailor Nagorny, who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch, passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms, behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings.

2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{kept her}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{that he might}} not see her rising colour.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} head. He had been {{standing}} with his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and Zoe had been facing it.|$|E
6000|$|JUDITH. That's a good girl! (She {{places a}} couple of chairs {{at the table with}} their <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> with a {{pleasant}} sense of being a more thoughtful housekeeper than Mrs. Dudgeon.) Do you know any of your father's relatives? ...|$|R
50|$|The {{pavilion}} had mirrors which {{reflected the}} falls, giving visitors, who sat with their <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>the</b> illusion, once the shutters or 'doors' were thrown open, {{that they were}} {{standing in the middle of}} the waterfalls. <b>The</b> Pavilion, according <b>to</b> another report had mirrors on its back wall. When the doors were opened visitors supposedly had the illusion of standing beneath the falls.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Romaine {{was sitting}} in a chair by the fire with his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> and I was myself {{kneeling}} on the hearthrug and beginning mechanically <b>to</b> pick up <b>the</b> scattered bills, when a honeyed voice joined suddenly in our conversation.|$|R
60|$|Slipping {{her hand}} away, she went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Harz stood, looking after her; then, taking up his palette, again began painting.|$|E
60|$|There was a pause. O'Moy, {{with his}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> now, his hands still clasped behind him, looked mockingly at Tremayne and waited.|$|E
60|$|Alicia and Barbara, though terribly {{disappointed}} at {{the failure}} of the exciting conspiracy, were ready enough to obey. Ursula wildly ran <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E

60|$|After a short silence, the Hermit bounced up again, {{and came}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> barred <b>window.</b>|$|R
60|$|She, {{with her}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> curtained <b>window,</b> watched <b>the</b> effect of her {{sentences}} and smiled.|$|R
60|$|But Blanchette had {{her part}} to play, and {{presently}} fluttered <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> ledge, cooing loudly as she pecked at something underneath her wing.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} he had reached the door, Mr. Flint had gone <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> once more, and {{appeared}} to have forgotten his presence.|$|E
6000|$|GLORIA. I mean {{an unwritten}} one. Perhaps I shall write it for you-- -when I know {{the end of}} it. (She goes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.)</b> ...|$|E
60|$|She went <b>back</b> {{mechanically}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>The</b> {{sight of}} the outer world, the occasional view of a passing vehicle, helped to sustain her.|$|R
50|$|On 18 April 2013, {{at about}} 4:30 pm, two window panes {{shattered}} {{in the front}} car of a commuter train while passing an express train going the opposite direction, resulting in minor lacerations to two high school students sitting with their <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> One window pane was also cracked on the passing train with no injuries. The accident occurred between Keikyu Taura and Anjinzuka stations, with approximately 30 people in the car {{at the time of}} the accident.|$|R
40|$|A man {{is seated}} at a table, holding a {{microphone}} and looking at a range of scientific equipment. There is a sheaf of papers {{on the surface of}} the table. He is being observed by two colleagues, who are standing with their <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> through which a stand of trees is visible. This photograph was taken during the course of the 12 th biennial Review of the Science and Arts, held at the William M. Rice Institute. Original resource is a black and white photograph...|$|R
60|$|Her eyes {{strayed from}} his face <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> again. There was no light {{anywhere}} in the house. It had a cold desolate look which chilled her.|$|E
60|$|D'Arnot coughed. The {{policeman}} looked up, and, {{catching his}} eye, raised {{his finger to}} admonish silence. D'Arnot turned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and presently the police officer spoke.|$|E
60|$|When he had sealed and stamped the envelope, he went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{and drew}} in a long breath. It was dark, but many stars shone now.|$|E
6000|$|There was a pause. Rufus turned <b>back</b> again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> [...] "When Farnaby's at home, {{where does}} he live?" [...] he asked suddenly--still keeping his face towards the street.|$|R
60|$|He went <b>back</b> again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{and looked}} out. It was the easiest excuse {{that he could}} devise for keeping his face turned away from her. She {{followed}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... "All the luck's on our side," [...] said a {{young man}} who until now had kept his <b>back</b> turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> He {{appeared}} <b>to</b> be rather stout, and had a thick crop of hair.|$|R
6000|$|RAINA (cutting him short contemptuously). It is {{unnecessary}} {{to tell us}} anything more. That is quite enough for us. (She turns her back on him and sweeps majestically <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.)</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They want to know," [...] said Mrs. Muldoon, [...] "if the Fairy's in." [...] The Professor, {{with his}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> was reading. The {{light in the}} room was {{somewhat}} faint.|$|E
6000|$|He {{leaned against}} the table, his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> [...] "Why, it is briefly this," [...] said he. [...] "My lord..." [...] And then he checked, and fell into a {{listening}} attitude.|$|E
60|$|Ella was, as {{a matter}} of fact, a few months over thirty herself; but she did not look nearly so much. Though so {{immature}} in nature, she was entering on that tract of life in which emotional women begin to suspect that last love may be stronger than first love; and she would soon, alas, enter on the still more melancholy tract when at least the vainer ones of her sex shrink from receiving a male visitor otherwise than with their <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> or <b>the</b> blinds half down. She reflected on Mrs. Hooper's remark, and said no more about age.|$|R
60|$|He was on {{his feet}} with his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>window,</b> rolling {{slightly}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> motion of the train. His face was pale, he had that sombre, haunted, unhappy look. Alvina, thrilled by the southern country, was smiling excitedly.|$|R
60|$|No persuasion {{should ever}} induce him <b>to</b> revisit <b>the</b> city; on the contrary, {{he would always}} have his great arm-chair placed with its <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> which looked in that direction, until a thick grove of trees, planted by his own hand, grew up and formed a screen that effectually {{excluded}} it from the prospect. He railed continually at the degenerate innovations and improvements introduced by the conquerors--forbade a word of their detested language to be spoken in his family, a prohibition readily obeyed, since none of the household could speak anything but Dutch, and even ordered a fine avenue to be cut {{down in front of}} his house because it consisted of English cherry trees.|$|R
