5|$|The {{need to keep}} {{information}} secret {{may also}} {{have contributed to the}} delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary patrol boat crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have <b>been</b> <b>outside</b> 'need to know' and would not have been informed about any of the incidents prior to the attack, they would not have been alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated {{in the early hours of}} the attack.|$|E
5|$|The same year, George {{married his}} first cousin, Sophia Dorothea of Celle, thereby {{securing}} additional incomes {{that would have}} <b>been</b> <b>outside</b> Salic laws. The marriage of state was arranged primarily as it ensured a healthy annual income and assisted the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle. His mother was at first against the marriage because she looked down on Sophia Dorothea's mother (who was not of royal birth), and because she was concerned by Sophia Dorothea's legitimated status. She was eventually won over by the advantages inherent in the marriage.|$|E

5|$|Back on the highway, an {{ambulance}} crew try to resuscitate Black, who has <b>been</b> <b>outside</b> his car {{through the night}} after his vision of Lee. After he comes to, he realizes this alternate reality was Lee showing him a life without the Millennium Group. However, he is left unsure whether his role within the Group is protecting his family from evil, or exposing them to it. Black seeks out Lee in a refugee camp; meanwhile, Law and his crewmen are also tracking her, conspiring to kill her to avenge their fellow crew. Lee turns the men against each other with her visions, before Black arrives to rescue her. As Black questions her as to the Group's influence, she resumes speaking in her unknown tongue, leaving Black without the answer he seeks.|$|E
5|$|The saga then relates how the Earl Maddaðr gave Sveinn guides, and how Sveinn {{travelled}} {{through the}} interior of the country—over mountains, and through woods, away from inhabited areas—until he came upon Strath Helmsdale, near where Ölvir and Frakökk lived. Williams stated that since the saga records that Sveinn approached the area by land, the site of Ölvir and Frakökk's estate was probably located somewhere in the dale of Helmsdale—not where the modern village is situated on the coast. Williams also noted that this area was quite remote from Orkney, and that it may have <b>been</b> <b>outside</b> of the control of the earldom. The saga states that Ölvir and Frakökk had spies on the lookout; however, because of the route taken by Sveinn, they were unaware of his presence until Svienn occupied a certain slope behind their homestead. The saga states that Ölvir and sixty of his men confronted Sveinn, although Þormóður Torfason's account of the incident gives forty. After a short clash, the saga states that, Ölvir's men soon gave way, and many were killed in the ensuing rout. Ölvir survived the clash, and fled up Helmsdale river. Meanwhile, Sveinn and his men continued on towards the houses. The area was plundered, and the houses were burnt to the ground with their inmates still inside—and in this way Frakökk perished. The saga states that Sveinn and his men committed many ravages in Sutherland before returning home. Upon reaching the river, Ölvir fled through the mountains, and is last heard making for the Suðreyjar; he is not mentioned again within the Orkneyinga saga. Later on within the saga, another of Frakökk's grandsons, Þórbjörn 'Clerk', who is a brother-in-law and close friend of Sveinn, has two of Sveinn's men killed for their part in the burning.|$|E

50|$|When {{converting}} a modus ponens, if A <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> {{the scope}} of H, {{then it will be}} necessary to apply axiom 1, A→(H→A), and modus ponens to get H→A. Similarly, if A→S <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> {{the scope of}} H, apply axiom 1, (A→S)→(H→(A→S)), and modus ponens to get H→(A→S). It should not be necessary to do both of these, unless the modus ponens step is the conclusion, because if both <b>are</b> <b>outside</b> the scope, then the modus ponens should have been moved up before H and thus <b>be</b> <b>outside</b> the scope also.|$|R

25|$|During the 19th century an {{extensive}} series of maps of Ireland {{was created by}} the Irish division of the Ordnance Survey for taxation purposes.

Slight adjustments are still made. There were 60,679 in 1911, compared to 60,462 townlands in 1901.|$|E

Pierce maintained strong support among Southern Democrats, as well as some support in his native New England. But other Northern Democrats opposed Pierce, who had become strongly associated with the unpopular Kansas-Nebraska Act. Buchanan, who had <b>been</b> <b>outside</b> of the country since 1853 and thus could not be associated with the act, became the candidate of many Northern Democrats.|$|E

25|$|The {{success and}} demand for Kngwarreye's {{paintings}} caused her many problems within the community {{as she tried to}} maintain her individual identity. The myth of the woman in her 80s who had never <b>been</b> <b>outside</b> the central desert becoming a great painter was one reason for her popularity. She had in fact, been to Perth, Adelaide, Sydney and Canberra, though this was only after she had become famous. There was much pressure from the white community for her to paint in a certain way, when they believed that one of her styles was more successful than others.|$|E

The shipping industry had <b>been</b> <b>outside</b> of the remit of the 1976 Race Relations Act, and discrimination within the industry was significant. In 1983, 90 per cent of Somali seamen living in Cardiff were unemployed.|$|E
