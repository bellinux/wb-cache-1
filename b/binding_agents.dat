25|$|Emergency 130 milligrams {{potassium}} iodide doses provide 100mg iodide (the other 30mg is the potassium in the compound), which is roughly 700 {{times larger than}} the normal nutritional need (see recommended dietary allowance) for iodine, which is 150 micrograms (0.15mg) of iodine (as iodide) per day for an adult.

25|$|Full depth {{reclamation}} is {{a process}} which pulverizes the full thickness of the asphalt pavement {{and some of the}} underlying material to provide a uniform blend of material. A binding agent may be mixed in to form a base course for the new pavement, or it may be left unbound to form a subbase course. Common <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> include asphalt emulsion, fly ash, Portland cement or calcium chloride. It can also be mixed with aggregate, recycled asphalt millings, or crushed Portland cement to improve the gradation of the material, and can provide a design life cycle of 30 years with proper lab testing and field verification.|$|E

25|$|Dark-skinned {{people who}} live in high latitudes with mild {{sunlight}} are at an increased risk – especially in the winter – of vitamin D deficiency. As a consequence of vitamin D deficiency, they are at a higher risk of developing rickets, and numerous types of cancers, and possibly cardiovascular disease and low immune system activity. However, some recent studies have questioned if the thresholds indicating Vitamin D deficiency in light-skinned individuals are relevant for dark-skinned individuals, as they found that on average dark-skinned individuals have higher bone density and lower risk of fractures than lighter-skinned individuals with the same levels of Vitamin D. This is attributed as possibly due to lower presence of Vitamin D <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> (and thus higher bioavailability) in dark-skinned individuals.|$|E
25|$|In {{part due}} to the global supply {{shortage}} of sassafras oil, substances that are sold as molly frequently contain no MDMA and instead contain methylone, ethylone, MDPV, mephedrone, or any other of the group of compounds commonly known as bath salts. Powdered MDMA ranges from pure MDMA to crushed tablets with 30–40% purity. MDMA tablets typically have low purity due to bulking agents that are added to dilute the drug and increase profits (e.g., lactose) and <b>binding</b> <b>agents.</b> Tablets sold as ecstasy sometimes contain 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), other amphetamine derivatives, caffeine, opiates, or painkillers. Some tablets contain little or no MDMA. The proportion of seized ecstasy tablets with MDMA-like impurities has varied annually and by country. The average content of MDMA in a preparation is 70 to 120mg with the purity having increased since the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|In ancient China, {{compressed}} teas {{were usually}} made with thoroughly dried and ground tea leaves that were pressed into various bricks or other shapes, although partially dried and whole leaves were also used. Some tea bricks were also mixed with <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> such as flour, blood, or manure to better preserve their form {{so they could}} withstand physical use as currency. [...] Newly formed tea bricks were then left to cure, dry, and age prior to being sold or traded. Tea bricks were preferred in trade prior to the 19th century in Asia since they were more compact than loose leaf tea and were also less susceptible to physical damage incurred through transportation over land by caravans on the Ancient tea route.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{refers to}} the fields of ceramics and powder metallurgy and relates to a process which could be applied as an adjustment device in firing systems. The invention {{is based on the}} technical problem of producing by shaping a flexible component consisting of several individual components finished in geometry and configuration and avoiding further process steps. In the process, a single component is shaped by homogenizing a sinterable ceramic or metallurgical powder using a thermoplastic <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> above the softening point and below the decomposition or evaporation temperature of said <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> and then inserting it into a tool. Then the tool is cooled to a temperature below the softening temperature of the thermoplastic <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> and the tool is then removed. Said individual element was shaped in an already existing individual component or a further individual component is shaped in the individual component produced according to the invention. After completion of th e entire component, the component is sintered after the thermoplastic <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> has completely cured...|$|R

40|$|Rice bran (RB) {{has been}} used as a natural fibre in {{polyolefin}} which results in lower mechanical properties and low interfacial adhesion that need a coupling agent or binder at higher loading. Rice bran (RB) and rice straw (RS) which both is low cost materials were developed in the processing of biodegradable packaging by using compression moulding technique. Glycerol, rice starch and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) have been used as <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> in this study where their physical (mechanical, chemical, and thermal) properties were studied base on the percentage of <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> used in RB/RS. Rice starch and PVAc increased the tearing strength and tensile strength of RB/RS. This was continued by fracture surface analysis using inverted microscopy where RS is clearly visible of phase separated without <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> as compared to RS with <b>binding</b> <b>agent.</b> Although rice starch and PVAc exhibited good mechanical properties, but they showed poor water resistance because of high in hydrophilic molecular structure. Starch influenced the rapid thermal degradation of RB/RS. By incorporation of PVAc in RB/RS, thermal stability property is increased...|$|R

50|$|The U1 {{station has}} an {{unpleasant}} smell which {{has given rise}} to urban legends. However, the true cause is that to prevent the sandy ground under the cathedral from sinking and undermining it, an organic <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> was used to stabilise the ground. On warm days, a chemical reaction caused by the <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> produces butyric acid, which mingles with seeping groundwater and causes the unpleasant odour and also leaves deposits in the station.|$|R

40|$|A surface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) device that responds to oxygen pressure was developed by coating a 158 MHz quartz surface {{acoustic wave}} (SAW) device with an oxygen <b>binding</b> <b>agent.</b> Two types of coatings were used. One type was prepared by dissolving an oxygen <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> in a toluene solution of a copolymer containing the axial ligand. A second type was prepared with an oxygen binding porphyrin solution containing excess axial ligand without a polymer matrix. In the polymer based coatings, the copolymer served to provide the axial ligand to the oxygen <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> and as a coating matrix {{on the surface of}} the SAW device. The oxygen sensing SAW device has been shown to bind oxygen following a Langmuir isotherm and may be used to measure the equilibrium constant of the oxygen binding compound in the coating matrix...|$|R

50|$|Engineered {{stone is}} less porous, more flexible, and harder than {{many types of}} natural stone. Less porous {{varieties}} are more resistant to mould and mildew than most natural stone types. Since it has a uniform internal structure, {{it does not have}} hidden cracks or flaws that may exist in natural stone. Its polyester resin <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> allow some flexibility, preventing cracking under flexural pressure. But, the <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> often continue to harden, leading to a loss of flexural strength over time. The polyester resins are not completely UV stable and engineered stone should not be used in outdoor applications. Continuous exposure to UV can cause discoloration of the stone, and breakdown of the resin binder.|$|E
