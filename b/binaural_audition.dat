40|$|Humans can {{recognize}} approximate room size using only <b>binaural</b> <b>audition.</b> However, sound reverberation is not negligible in most environments. The reverberation causes temporal {{fluctuations in the}} short-term interaural phase differences (IPDs) of sound pressure. This study proposes a novel method for a binaural humanoid robot head to estimate room volume. The method {{is based on the}} statistical properties of the short-term IPDs of sound pressure. The humanoid robot turns its head toward a sound source, recognizes the sound source, and then estimates the ego-centric distance by its stereovision. By interpolating the relations between room volume, average standard deviation, and ego-centric distance experimentally obtained for various rooms in a prepared database, the room volume was estimated by the <b>binaural</b> <b>audition</b> of the robot from the average standard deviation of the short-term IPDs at the estimated distance...|$|E
40|$|The Sensorama is the prototypical {{embodiment}} of a virtual environment (VE), conceived and implemented years before “VR ” (or “virtual reality”) became a common term. Whereas VR has been often characterized as “goggles and gloves, ” Heilig (1962) developed a truly multimodal display system that provided for stereoscopic vision, <b>binaural</b> <b>audition,</b> haptics (wind in the face; vibration or “jolts”), and olfaction. Figure 5. 1 shows the patent drawing for the containers {{that served as}} the Sensorama’s olfactory sources. Those containers, coupled with the system’s fan, comprise what is likely the first example of an olfactory display that was integrated with other display modalities. In many respects his invention still stands alone in terms of the degree of integration of multimodal displays in a practical device that provided a compelling virtual experience for the user. In this chapter we examine nonvisual and nonauditory displays that have been used or have the potential to be used in virtual environments for training...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a multisource speech localization method {{based on the}} generalized cross-correlation (GCC) method weighted by the phase transform (PHAT) for <b>binaural</b> robot <b>audition.</b> The direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation based on the GCC-PHAT method was extended to enable simultaneous multiple DOA estimations with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) -based weighting function. The standard K-means clustering algorithm was improved {{for the purpose of}} multisource speech localization by adding two additional steps that increase the number of clusters automatically and eliminate clusters containing incorrect DOA estimations. Experiments conducted on the SIG- 2 humanoid robot in real environments show that our method can localize multiple speech sources in real-time with localization error below 5. 96 °. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} sound {{localization}} algorithm {{inspired by a}} cross-channel algorithm first studied by MacDonald et. al in 2008. The original algorithm assumes that the Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) of the robotic head under study are precisely known, which is rarely the case in practice. Following the idea that any head {{is more or less}} spherical, the above assumption is relaxed by using HRTFs computed using a simple spherical head model with the same head radius as the robot head. In order to evaluate the proposed approach in realistic noisy conditions, an isotropic noise field is also computed and a precise definition of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in a binaural context is outlined. All these theoretical developments are finally assessed with simulated and experimental signals. Despite its simplicity, the proposed approach appears to be robust to noise and to provide reliable sound localization estimations in the frontal azimuthal plane. This work was conducted within the French/Japan BINAAHR (<b>BINaural</b> Active <b>Audition</b> for Humanoid Robots) project under Contract n ANR- 09 -BLAN- 0370 - 02 funded by the French National Research Agency...|$|R
