The majority of herpers practice careful capture and release {{in the same}} spot, as many herps have their own territories and replacing them somewhere else would be a disturbance. As wilderness areas shrink, herpers are concentrated into smaller areas, and commercial collectors often encounter field biologists which may have quite different approaches to their study animals. Many species are also threatened or endangered and thus {{it is illegal to}} take them from the wild. Another consideration is spreading of diseases, such as the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis responsible for a worldwide decline in amphibian populations, which may be spread inadvertently by humans.|$|E

40|$|Methods {{available}} to assess animal welfare at farm level {{are based on}} a range of welfare parameters, which can be divided into two categories, environment-based and animal-based parameters. The first category describes features of the environment and management, which can be considered prerequisites for welfare. The second category records animals' responses to that particular environment and management more directly. Objective {{of this study was to}} validate a mainly environment-based method, the animal needs index (ANI), with animal-based methods: <b>behavioural</b> <b>observations</b> and feather condition scores (FCS). The study was conducted on 20 commercial laying hen farms, 10 farms with battery cages and 10 farms with deep litter systems. During a 1 -day visit on each farm, ANI was assessed, FCS was scored, and <b>behavioural</b> <b>observations</b> were performed. Instantaneous scan sampling and continuous focal sampling were used to assess the time spent on different behaviours and the occurrence of event behaviours. Data from <b>behavioural</b> <b>observations</b> and FCS were reduced with principal factor analysis. This resulted in two factors for each method. Significant positive correlations were found between ANI, on the one hand, and 'movement' and 'comfort', two factors from <b>behavioural</b> <b>observations,</b> on the other hand. A significant negative correlation was found between ANI and 'wing damage' (from FCS). The results of this study show that ANI is valid and sensitive enough to show differences in animal welfare between housing systems, whereas differences in welfare within housing systems cannot be shown. In conclusion, ANI is an appropriate method for assessment of laying hen welfare on a large number of farms with different housing systems...|$|R

50|$|Uttal focusses on {{the limits}} of localizing {{cognitive}} processes in the brain. One of his main arguments is that since the late 90's, research in cognitive neuroscience has forgotten about conventional psychophysical studies based on <b>behavioural</b> <b>observation.</b> He believes that current research focusses on the technological advances of brain imaging techniques such as MRI and PET scans. Thus, he further suggest that this research {{is dependent on the}} assumptions of localization and hypothetical cognitive modules that use such imaging techniques to pursuit these assumptions. Uttal's major concern incorporates many controversies with the validly, over-assumptions and strong inferences some of these images are trying to illustrate. For instance, there is concern over the proper utilization of control images in an experiment. Most of the cerebrum is active during cognitive activity, therefore the amount of increased activity in a region must be greater when compared to a controlled area. In general, this may produce false or exaggerated findings and may increase potential tendency to ignore regions of diminished activity which may be crucial to the particular cognitive process being studied. Moreover, Uttal believes that localization researchers tend to ignore the complexity of the nervous system. Many regions in the brain are physically interconnected in a nonlinear system, hence, Uttal believes that behaviour is produced by a variety of system organizations.|$|E

We used <b>behavioural</b> <b>observations</b> and stable isotope mixing models to investigate the feeding ecology of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in the lagoon of Mayotte (East Africa). We identified prey during 77 % of 54 observed feeding events, observed in both rainy (61 % of events) and dry (39 %) seasons. Caranx melampygus and Gnathanodon speciosus were involved in 67 % of these events, with Tylosurus crocodilus (20 %) and Mugil cephalus (13 %) also consumed. Mixing models, based on δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of skin and blubber (n = 30 samples for both tissues), suggest that <b>behavioural</b> <b>observations</b> are representative of general feeding patterns. Indeed, C. melampygus and T. crocodilus (G. speciosus could not be included in models) were estimated to contribute most to dolphin diets, with mean estimated contributions of 44. 6 % (± 18. 9) and 48. 1 % (± 19. 1) for skin and 73. 7 % (± 14. 9) and 16. 9 % (± 12. 4) for blubber, respectively.

40|$|Background: Early {{detection}} of hearing loss {{has been a}} long-standing priority {{in the field of}} audiology. Currently available auditory testing methods include both behavioural and non-behavioural or objective tests of hearing. This study was planned with an objective to assess hearing loss in children using <b>behavioural</b> <b>observation</b> audiometry and brain stem evoked response audiometry. Methods: A total of 105 cases suffering from severe to profound hearing loss were registered. After proper history and clinical examination patients were subjected to <b>behavioural</b> <b>observation</b> audiometry (BOA) and brainstem evoked response audiometry test (BERA). Results: Out of 105 cases in 62 cases (59. 05 %) the findings of both BOA and BERA tests were similar but in 43 cases the findings of both tests were not similar. In total 18 cases (17. 14 %) diagnosis of severe hearing loss could be made by BERA test only because of in 10 cases there was inconclusive BOA finding and in 8 cases there was no response in BOA test. Conclusions: <b>Behavioural</b> <b>observation</b> audiometry can detect hearing loss but in developmentally retardrd children in whom responses are difficult to elicited, this test is not so conclusive. BERA is the tool which can confirm the normal sensitivity of hearing in such persons whenever required and is very useful in early {{detection of}} hearing loss and planning rehabilitative procedures.

Using a parentage analysis, fitness of individuals in the first generation was quantified as the numbers of offspring that survived to maturity. Although mating behaviour can be predicted by environmental and demographical variables, the numbers of mature offspring produced (fitness) cannot, and crucially, are poorly correlated with <b>behavioural</b> <b>observations</b> of mating. While fitness of both sexes {{was positively related to}} mating behaviour and to female’s ectoparasite burden, these <b>behavioural</b> <b>observations</b> explained little more variance in offspring production than environmental and demographical variables.

The <b>behavioural</b> <b>observation</b> in the tank revealed that the larvae extended the dorsal and pelvic spines during passive transport and retracted during swimming; the angles of the dorsal and pelvic spines in relation to the anteroposterior axis were larger during the passive transport (mean±s. d. = 28 · 84 ± 14 · 27 and 20 · 35 ± 15 · 05 °) than those during the swimming (mean±s. d. = 2 · 59 ± 5 · 55 and 0 · 32 ± 6 · 49 °). The CFD analysis indicated that the relative hydrodynamic drag acting on the larvae was approximately 1 · 25 times higher when the spines were extended (passive transport) than when the spines were retracted (swimming), suggesting that the E. ongus larvae have an ability to adjust their hydrodynamic drag depending on the behavioural context.

Here we conducted in situ <b>behavioural</b> <b>observations</b> of two species of demersal coral reef fishes using cameras and/or observers to examine the biases associated with either approach. For both treatments, we generated 25 min time series of a number of vigilance-associated behaviours (i. e., distance from shelter and mate, time out of shelter, swimming activity) and estimated the point of acclimation using changepoint analysis. In the camera trials, acclimation in both species appeared to occur between 2 and 7 min for different behaviours. When an observer was present, however, no apparent acclimation occurred until the observer left the area. Overall, our findings demonstrate that (1) behavioural studies of wild fishes conducted by an observer may be biased due to permanent observer effects, and (2) when using video equipment, a species- and behaviour-specific acclimation period should precede behavioural scoring...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of {{cognitive}} rehabilitation following traumatic brain injury is to help people perform everyday tasks. However, options for the rigorous assessment of everyday cognitive effectiveness after rehabilitation are limited. Performance on neuropsychological tests is only moderately correlated with everyday functioning, while previous measures of everyday functioning include only fairly general estimates of overall cognitive functioning. The aim of the current study was to develop an ecologically valid measure that captured a number of subdomains of executive functioning, using systematic <b>behavioural</b> <b>observation</b> of an everyday task. The initial phase of the research involved identifying an everyday task that was sufficiently complex to ensure that executive functioning was utilised in the completion of the task. Participants with traumatic brain injury were then asked to prepare chocolate brownies, using a recipe provided, and a hot drink. Participants were allowed to use any compensatory strategy to help complete the task. Participant performance was directly observed by an examiner and videotaped for subsequent inter-rater reliability. Two independent raters assessed nine components of executive functioning. During this phase, the examiner manuals were modified improving inter-rater reliability. The final version of the measure was then trialled with participants with and without traumatic brain injury. Final inter-rater reliability indicated the approach had merit. Significant and moderate correlations were found between traditional measures of executive functioning and the everyday task. This study employed systematic <b>behavioural</b> <b>observation</b> to obtain fine-grained information regarding a person’s cognitive functioning.

40|$|Background. The {{measurement}} of subjective well-being {{in people with}} severe and profound intellectual disabilities is a difficult challenge. Since they cannot self-report about their life satisfaction, due to severe communicative and cognitive limitations, <b>behavioural</b> <b>observations</b> of their emotions and moods are important in the {{measurement of}} their subjective well-being. It is however not known if observations of mood and emotion can be differentiated in people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities and if mood and emotions can give unique information about their affect. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study is to examine the relationship between mood and emotions in people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities, using <b>behavioural</b> <b>observations.</b> As recommended in the literature, we investigated the frequency and intensity of the emotion separately. Method. In a period of three weeks 27 participants with severe and profound intellectual disabilities were presented with four staff-selected negative and four staff-selected positive stimuli. During the presentation participants were videotaped using the observational method of Petry & Maes (2006) where each behaviour is coded on a 5 -point scale, ranging from indicating a very negative emotion to indicating a very positive emotion. As a measure of mood, the staff completed the MIPQ (Ross & Oliver, 2003) in the beginning of the three weeks. Results. We found a positive relationship between mood and respectively the total emotion score and the frequency of the emotion when the stimuli were positive but not when the stimuli were negative. There was no relationship between mood and the intensity of the emotion. Discussion. Our results indicate that mood and emotions can be distinguished from each other using <b>behavioural</b> <b>observations.</b> Both can give specific information about the affective life of people with severe or profound intellectual disabilities. Moreover, if further research could replicate the results of this study, an implication is that the direct support workers should be aware of a decline in the frequency of their clients reactions to positive stimuli since this could indicate a decline in their mood. status: publishe...|$|R
