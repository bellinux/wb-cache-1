50|$|During the 1930s, 5 H type <b>were</b> {{experimentally}} <b>fitted</b> with pantographs of 5 different patterns. 376 <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with a Simens Schukert pantograph, 377 <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with a Fischer bow collector, 378 <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with an ASEA pantograph, 379 <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with a Metropolitan Vickers pantograph and 380 <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with an English Electric pantograph. The pantographs on 376, 379 and 380 <b>were</b> all <b>fitted</b> {{on a small}} pantograph tower while 377 and 378 {{had their}} pantographs mounted on the roof itself. During the experiments, the pantographs were only used on the reserve track section {{which at the time}} <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with a railway-like catenary overhead system rather than the traditional tramway-style overhead used {{on the rest of the}} system. Because the overhead at the time was not staggered to suit pantograph operation, the pantographs fitted all suffered from uneven wear and as a result the experiment ceased. Ironically, all the surviving H type trams <b>were</b> <b>fitted</b> with pantographs 50 years later in October 1986.|$|R

5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can <b>be</b> <b>fitted</b> into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} end-of-life care, Brady died of restrictive {{pulmonary disease}} in Ashworth Hospital on 15 May 2017. On 21 September 2017, the inquest {{found that he}} {{died of natural causes}} and his hunger strike had not been a contributory factor. Brady had refused food and fluids for more than 48 hours on various occasions, causing him to <b>be</b> <b>fitted</b> with a nasogastric tube, although his inquest noted that his body mass index was not a cause for concern. Brady was cremated on 25 October 2017 and his ashes were disposed of at sea.|$|E
50|$|De Broekmolen {{was built}} in 1876 by {{millwright}}s Wietse Jurjen en Comp.
