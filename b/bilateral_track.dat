40|$|Abstract. The {{crucible}} in {{this scenario}} for the international climate regime {{is the emergence of}} an effective and liquid international carbon market with participation of private entities. In order to make the carbon market effective a bilateral negoti-ation track will develop, operating in parallel with the multilateral track under the UNFCCC. The purpose of the <b>bilateral</b> <b>track</b> is to integrate the various emissions trading schemes involving private actors. This <b>bilateral</b> <b>track</b> feeds into the UNFCCC negotiations, which still represents the main arena for the international climate negotiations. Through the bilateral, bottom-up negotiations, a multistage system develops, with differentiated rights and duties, complemented by a package of coordinated support mechanisms. The advantages of such a bottom-up approach prove to be, inter alia, fewer negotiating parties, new negotiation arenas, and a new set of selective incentives. The result is a continuously evolving agreement with the potential to gradually broaden participation and deepen the reduction commitments of the international climate regime. Moreover, the bilateral agreements for linking schemes with private actors also represent a fallback {{in the event of a}} collapse in the multilateral negotiations...|$|E
40|$|In 2007, the EU {{launched}} a Strategic Partnership with Brazil despite the EU’s commitment to multilateralism {{and despite the}} long-lasting interregional relationship between the EU and MERCOSUR since 1995. By singling out Brazil, the EU shifted from the EU-MERCOSUR interregional negotiations on an Association Agreement (1999 - 2004) to a <b>bilateral</b> <b>track.</b> In view of the EU’s inconsistency in multilateral, interregional, and bilateral approaches towards South America, the paper will analyze why the EU shifted to a Strategic Partnership, and it will compare the interregional negotiations (1999 - 2004) with the bilateral talks with Brazil (since 2007). The comparative analysis will rely on original data from 29 semi-structured elite interviews conducted in Brussels, Belgium, and Montevideo, Uruguay, and on grey literature and the news portal Mercopress. The paper argues that the EU switched from interregional to bilateral talks because it feared losing Brazil to its competitors, the U. S. and China. In its endeavor to prevent this loss, when interregional negotiations seemed fruitless because of MERCOSUR’s increasing fragmentation, the EU privileged Brazil as a strategic partner. Although the EU has committed itself to supporting regional integration in South America, material interests have sidelined this commitment. This paper looks at these – to date little studied – material interests that have rendered the EU’s foreign policy towards developing regions vulnerable to international factors...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{looks into}} {{whether and how}} Georgian NGOs have made use ofthe opportunities available to them within the developing relations between the EU and Georgia. This qualitative in-depth case study based research focusing on Georgia is set within the theoretical fields of external europeanization and democracy assistance. It aims to uncover how networks emerge that transcend the international-domestic divide and how Georgian NGOs have participated in these networks. Since the 2004 big bang enlargement, when 10 new states acceded, the EU has been continuously confronted with popular protests against authoritarian regimes in its neighbourhood. Both the wave of colour revolutions in the Eastern neighbourhood and {{the events of the}} Arab Spring caught the EU by surprise. The EU failed to respond to the demand for increased EU support from within the neighbourhood and was overtaken by these events. While the EU introduced specific policies for the neighbouring countries {{in the form of the}} European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership (EaP), these appeared to only have had limited impact on democratization. Generally, critics regarded this as proof that the EU was unable to formulate and implement a coherent external policy and that it still relied on its conditionality-based tools in order to support democratization outside its borders. This research analyzes the usefulness ofthe ENP and EaP as democracy assistance policies through a different framework in order to uncover other mechanisms through which the EU may facilitate democracy assistance in its neighbourhood. The theoretical foundation of this research consists of two fields of thinking: democracy assistance and external europeanization. From the first field, this research borrows the view that successful international democracy assistance focuses on creating favourable circumstances for NGOs to work in and on fostering links between NGOs and the state. The second field looks to howthe EU influences countries outside its borders and how this affects the policies and politics of third countries. While the direct democracy assistance programmes of the EU may be largely ineffective, the ENP and EaP introduce potential forms of engagement for non-state actors. By doing so, these policies create opportunities for interaction between different actors, including NGOs, which is a form of back door democracy assistance, identified as a network governance model of democracy assistance in this research. In this form of democracy assistance, NGOs are not considered as targets of democracy assistance programmes, but as actors that make use of the pressure for adaption caused by the rhetorical support for democratization within the ENP/EaP agenda. This agenda mayoffer NGOs different types of resources, leading to different forms of empowerment. In order to test these theoretical assumptions, this research looks to the single case of post-Rose Revolution Georgia. The case ofGeorgia combines three elements that are crucial if the proposed theoryis to be upheld: institutionalization of relations between the EU and Georgia in the framework of the ENP/EaP, a rhetorical commitment to European integration and democratization by the Georgian government and the existence of a vibrant NGO scene in Georgia. Through qualitative research,including more than 70 interviews, this research looks into whether Georgian NGOs perceived the ENP/EaP as an opportunity to strengthen their own agenda, substantiating three main findings. First, this research considers whether the ENP and EaP have indeed entailed a new form of governance that would allow for a network governance model of democracy assistance. The ENP turned out to borrow heavily from the earlier experience of enlargement, continuing to build on traditional forms of bilateral relations and failing to export the EUs model of governance outside its borders. Despite the stress on the importance of democratization there was no room for institutionalized inclusion of non-state actorssuch as NGOs. The ENP can be considered a form of external europeanization using mainly conditionality-based tools, failing to create a form ofnetwork mode of governance. The EaPs multilateral track introduced horizontal governance structures into the EUs relations with its Eastern neighbours. Several institutions, such as the Civil Society Forum (CSF), have been created that allow for the involvement of non-state actors. Incontrast to the ENP the EaP did succeed in initiating a network mode ofgovernance within its external relations. However, this remains limitedas bilateral relations continue to play a more determinant role in the EaP compared to advisory bodies such as the CSF. Although the EU claimedthat the ENP was to introduce novel forms of governance, the creation of the EaPs CSF signalled the first actual step in this direction. This shows how there is a disparity between the EUs ambition in this field and the realization of this aspiration. Second, the question is whether Georgian NGOs perceive the ENP/EaP as an opportunity. Under the ENP there was a lack of institutional embeddedness which hampered the effectiveness of the activities of NGOs within the ENP. The EU from its sidehad no clear commitment towards civil society inclusion and the initiatives that were started by Georgian NGOs failed to connect with the ENPsinstitutions. In contrast to the ENP, the EaP offers NGOs institutionalembeddedness, opening up a network mode of governance assistance in stead of the sole use of an unintended back door form, as was the case inthe ENP. As a result, Georgian NGOs have made use of the opportunities within the EaP in a different way than under the ENP. Although the extrafunding and their inclusion into the CSF strengthened their position, the fact that NGOs remained outside the <b>bilateral</b> <b>track</b> restricted their opportunities. Third, the EaP has indeed contributed to thedevelopment towards a network mode of governance democracy assistance. The introduction of the CSF and the associated National Platform (NP), together with a more coordinated and focused approach towards direct civil society assistance from the part of the EU, have resulted in the creation of an international and domestic network of NGOs and in closer and more direct ties between EU institutions and NGOs. This is the result of the incremental progress made by the EU towards realizing its goal of a novel way of setting up relations with partners from the countries from the EaP and of creating a partnership with society. However, members of the NP still consider their role and input in the overall EaP-framework to be limited, especially when looking to the impact of NGOs on other political actors such as the government. This last finding indicates that the domestic context is still the dominant factor when assessing the effectiveness of this network mode of governance democracy assistance.

40|$|The recent {{election}} of Benjamin Netanjahu {{as the new}} prime minister of Israel has created apprehensions, particularly among the country 2 ̆ 7 s Arab neighbours, that the peace process in the Middle East could result in deadlock or even fail. First Arab reactions to the change in the political leadership have been characterised by a mistrust of Netanjahu and of his coalition government. However, both the summit meeting of the Arab League held on 22 / 23 June, 1996 and the diplomatic activities of leading Arab politicians {{have made it clear that}} those countries which have already concluded peace treaties with Israel have no wish to jeopardise them. Even Syria whose negotiations with Israel were suspended months ago does not seem to wish to exacerbate the situation. Against this background, Israel and Jordan are the countries which could have a key role to play: Bilaterally, their relations have already improved considerably on the basis of the peace treaty of 1994. But this treaty also contains a multilateral provision which still remains to be fulfilled: this is that both Parties have committed themselves to the creation of a Conference on Security and Co-operation in the Middle East (CSCME) along the lines of the Helsinki (CSCE) process. There is to date, however, no evidence of any activity on either side to im plement this part of the peace treaty. This Report examines the question as to whether or not it would make sense to create a CSCME in addition, or as an alternative to either the Madrid peace process which seems to stagger along tenaciously, or the Mediterranean conference, initiated by the European Union some months ago, which also involves part of the Middle East region. Since the authors of the Israeli-Jordan plan obviously had the 2 ̆ 7 success-model 2 ̆ 7 of the CSCE in mind, this Report also looks at some of the basic factors and circumstances responsible for the success of the CSCE and tries to discover whether or not comparable conditions exist in the Middle East, particularly: · a geographical delimitation of the region that makes sense politically and ensures that all parties involved in conflicts in the region and necessary for their solution are included in the negotiations; · the presence of 2 ̆ 7 important 2 ̆ 7 parties prepared to take the initiative in extending invitations, in sponsoring or moderating such negotiations; · the willingness of the parties involved in regional conflicts both to contribute to their solu tion without recourse to military action or other means of force (except for the purpose of self-defence) and to consider future developments 2 ̆ 7 open-mindedly 2 ̆ 7 in the sense that fron tiers and zones of influence can be amended by peaceful means and by agreement; · a broad concept of 2 ̆ 7 security 2 ̆ 7 which includes both co-operation as a means of achieving common security, and package deals to arrive at a balanced compensation of give and take; and finally · a willingness to embark on a lengthy process of compensation of interests, trust in the con fidence building quality of verifiable agreements and the healthy effect of implementation debates where alleged cases of non-implementation must be explained. Although all the conditions under which a possible CSCME would have to be organised are too intricate to justify their comparison with the European situation of the early seventies, the following criteria provide a useful framework for a debate: · today it is no longer possible to juxtapose the states of the Middle East against each other as antagonists of an East-West conflict, neither can these countries profit any more finan cially from such a confrontation. On the contrary: the global situation has developed in the opposite direction, manifesting a general tendency and willingness to help bring peace to the region, and even to pay for it; · one Middle East state appears to fulfil the main criteria required to extend an invitation to CSCME-consultations, namely Egypt. The country has the necessary political weight, dip lomatic relations with all of the potential participants, and has for many years actively pro moted the peace process; · although 2 ̆ 7 refraining from the threat or use of force 2 ̆ 7 is not yet a principle applied by all par ties to conflicts in the region, it does at least figure in all declarations governing the relations of Israel with Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Council; · it is furthermore an open question whether the parties to a CSCME will comprehend, dur ing the multilateral negotiating process, that mutual and common security cannot be reached overnight: intermediate steps will first be required in order to build confidence; and that 2 ̆ 7 conventional thinking 2 ̆ 7 can only be overcome by open debates on the implementation of, or the difficulties in implementing agreed measures. All of these are arguments in favour of a negotiated peace. This is the aim of the Madrid peace process which started in October 1991, and which was shaped after the CSCE model. The same is also true for the Mediterranean Conference, convened in Barcelona by the European Community in November 1995, in which a part of the Middle East region is represented. This Report tries to establish therefore why 2 ̆ 7 Madrid 2 ̆ 7 has not so far become a synonym for success in the way 2 ̆ 7 Helsinki 2 ̆ 7 did, and why Barcelona cannot replace a CSCME. The Madrid peace negotiations run along four bilateral tracks - those between Israel and the Palestinians, and with Jordan, the Lebanon and Syria; multilateral negotiations are held in five working groups, each addressing a specific subject and involving a great number of states of which only a few actually belong to the region. A comparison of these two levels of negotiation shows that the bilateral one is the more important of the two. When difficulties arise on a <b>bilateral</b> <b>track,</b> talks on the same subject then stagnate in the multilateral working group: the September 1993 Oslo agreement which in turn led to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan of October 1994 stimulated talks at the multilateral level. Thus, the structure of the Madrid peace process differs from that of the CSCE in two impor tant ways: in its focus on bilateral negotiations, and in the open-endedness of its multilateral negotiations in which an ever greater number of non-regional states and organisations partici pate. Each of these factors appears to have been detrimental to a smooth development of the process. The multilateral negotiations in particular suffer from repeated bouts of stagnation. Positive post- 1993 results were due to progress in the bilateral negotiations between Israel and the PLO, and between Israel and Jordan. The Madrid process therefore can draw nearer the aims of its initiators only if there were to be progress in the negotiations between Israel and Syria, and between Israel and the Lebanon. Even then, however, the final aim of a compre hensive peace in the region still cannot be realised since two of its states are excluded: Iraq and Iran. The very fact that their present regimes are both notorious trouble-shooters and Is rael 2 ̆ 7 s arch-enemies should induce the initiators of a CSCME to bind them in into any lasting regional settlement. There is also reason to believe that the large number of outer-regional participants involved in the Madrid process is less than helpful from the point of view that their understanding of 2 ̆ 7 peace 2 ̆ 7 only partly coincides with that of the states of the region; furthermore, they do not always play the role which the regional parties expect of them. The Barcelona Mediterranean Conference, on the other hand, is of very recent date and the measures it has so far contemplated - in particular preparations for a Free Trade Zone - carry a fulfilment deadline as far into the future as 2010. Nothing very definite can as yet be said about the success of this endeavour. One point, however, is quite clear: its main emphasis will be on economic co-operation, in particular with the Maghreb and much less with the Middle East region. Since both 2 ̆ 7 Madrid 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Barcelona 2 ̆ 7 appear to have encountered difficulties in realising a comprehensive peace settlement for the Middle East, it does indeed seem worthwhile considering a new departure: to promote the idea of a 2 ̆ 7 Conference on Security and Co- operation in the Middle East 2 ̆ 7. The participants of this Conference ought to comprise the states of the 2 ̆ 7 central zone 2 ̆ 7, i. e. Israel, its Arab neighbours and the Palestinian Council; the member-states of the Gulf Co- operation Council; and also those states which to varying degrees are involved in conflicts geographically located between the Mediterranean and the Persian-Arabian Gulf, i. e. Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Cyprus. The invitation should be based on one of the most important criteria which enabled the Europeans and North Americans to accept the Finnish invitation to the 2 ̆ 7 Helsinki Consultations 2 ̆ 7 : the participation of governments in the consultations and negotiations does not constitute a legal recognition of the existing political conditions in the region. All those states and organisations outside the Middle East region which have for years engaged themselves politically, militarily or economically in the area, such as the United States, the United Nations, the Russian Federation and the European Union, should play an important role in the process, but rather that of a moderator deprived of the right to vote, whilst other interested states such as Japan could be given observer status (as in the case of the OSCE) - to underline the character of a CSCME as a regional conference which places the interests of the parties directly concerned at the centre of its attention. It should in principle be possible to put all questions of security and co-operation which are of importance to the region, on the agenda of a CSCME. It seems, however, likely that agree ments can be reached more easily on some subject matters than on others. The parties to the Conference would therefore be well advised to start off with only five of the ten principles of the Helsinki Final Act, i. e. refraining from the threat or use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, non-intervention in internal affairs, co-operation among states and the fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international law. Such a catalogue commonly agreed between the participants of a CSCME would in itself already constitute a great success. · The principle 2 ̆ 7 Refraining from the threat or use of force 2 ̆ 7 is part of the Charter of the United Nations and should be supported by all regional parties to the Conference, even by those which at present do not represent a state authority. · The principle 2 ̆ 7 Peaceful settlement of disputes 2 ̆ 7 might induce Iran and Iraq - if invited to the Conference - to return to a system of international law to which they had already obliged themselves when joining the United Nations, since their participation in this Conference would put an end to their isolation. · The principle 2 ̆ 7 Non-intervention in internal affairs 2 ̆ 7 is also a part of the UN Charter and fre quently invoked by Israel and its Arab neighbours. The last paragraph of this principle, as formulated in the Helsinki Final Act, is of particular interest under present Middle East conditions: The participants of the CSCE agreed that they will 2 ̆ 7 [...] . refrain from direct or indirect assistance to terrorist activities, or to subversive or other activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another participating State. 2 ̆ 7 · The principle 2 ̆ 7 Co-operation among States 2 ̆ 7 opens up possibilities for fields of interstate relations beyond the intricate security problems and the fundamental differences behind them, and provide participants with opportunities to better understanding and appreciation of the importance and usefulness of good neighbourly relations. · Finally, the principle 2 ̆ 7 Fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international law 2 ̆ 7 - the Xth principle of the Helsinki Final Act - would seem to be suitable for inclusion in a Final Document of a first CSCME since all parties to conflicts in the Middle East consider it very important to fulfil acrimoniously any treaty once it has been concluded. On the other hand, the Conference could be blocked at an early stage if participants attempted during the first round of negotiations to agree on common formulae of controversial principles such as sovereign equality, inviolability of frontiers, territorial integrity and equal rights and self-determination of peoples, or similarly if they attempted to define together the meaning of human rights 2 ̆ 7 criteria such as freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief. When embarking on an inter-cultural dialogue on human rights issues, participants must be very cautious. By no means ought this dialogue to be overshadowed by other topics nor should it be misused as negotiating fat to obtain better results in other fields. The criteria worked out by the 1990 CSCE Conference in Copenhagen on the subject of National Minorities could be studied with a view to their suitability for the settlement of inter-ethnic conflicts in the Middle-East. A CSCME would also be well advised, in the beginning, not to be too ambitious in terms of reducing military hardware and to content itself, like the CSCE, with a discussion of Confi dence Building Measures such as the prior notification of major military manoeuvres and the voluntary exchange of observers. Since the potential participants 2 ̆ 7 interests in economic co-op eration seem to differ considerably, they would be well advised to start off by ending all forms of boycotts and similar restrictions. The facilitation of tourism across the border, family reunification, a better exchange of information, youth exchanges and other such steps might later culminate in a vast system of international arrangements such as the 2 ̆ 7 human dimension 2 ̆ 7 of the CSCE/OSCE. *** The co-operation of the two authors of this Report stems from a lecture read by Götz von Groll on 13 th March, 1996 entitled 2 ̆ 7 Can the lessons learned from the CSCE be helpful in set tling the conflicts in the Middle East? 2 ̆ 7 which was part of the 6 th spring academy of the PRIF on the subject: 2 ̆ 7 The Mediterranean - a zone of unrest 2 ̆ 7 conducted by Berthold Meyer. Götz von Groll was the desk officer of Auswärtiges Amt co-ordinating the CSCE-policy of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany from 1971 to 1977. During these years, he participated in all CSCE consultations, the formulation of the CSCE-Final Act in Geneva as well as the Foreign Ministers and the Summit Conference in Helsinki 1973 / 75. In 1977, he was head of the Federal German Delegation for the preparation of the first CSCE Follow-up meeting in Belgrade.

40|$|A {{balance of}} mutual tonic {{inhibition}} between bi-hemispheric posterior parietal cortices {{is believed to}} play an important role in bilateral visual attention. However, experimental support for this notion has been mainly drawn from clinical models of unilateral damage. We have previously shown that low-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) over the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) generates a contralateral attentional deficit in <b>bilateral</b> visual <b>tracking.</b> Here, we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to study whether rTMS temporarily disrupts the inter-hemispheric balance between bilateral IPS in visual attention. Following application of 1 Hz rTMS over the left IPS, subjects performed a <b>bilateral</b> visual <b>tracking</b> task while their brain activity was recorded using fMRI. Behaviorally, tracking accuracy was reduced immediately following rTMS. Areas ventro-lateral to left IPS, including inferior parietal lobule (IPL), lateral IPS (LIPS), and middle occipital gyrus (MoG), showed decreased activity following rTMS, while dorsomedial areas, such as Superior Parietal Lobule (SPL), Superior occipital gyrus (SoG), and lingual gyrus, as well as middle temporal areas (MT+), showed higher activity. The brain activity of the homologues of these regions in the un-stimulated, right hemisphere was reversed. Interestingly, the evolution of network-wide activation related to attentional behavior following rTMS showed that activation of most occipital synergists adaptively compensated for contralateral and ipsilateral decrement after rTMS, but that of parietal synergists, and SoG remained competing. This pattern of ipsilateral and contralateral activations empirically supports the hypothesized loss of inter-hemispheric balance that underlies clinical manifestation of visual attentional extinction...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to prove the {{progress}} of the Eastern Partnership despite the unsettled economic and political situation in most of participating countries by means of a closer look at the bilateral and multilateral economic cooperation between EU and the partners and by emphasizing the main guidelines and potential of the implemented projects in the sphere of economic integration and convergence with EU policies.

40|$|Hoffman, James E. Information in each {{visual field}} is {{initially}} processed in visual areas {{located in the}} contralateral hemisphere. This segregation of information between the two hemispheres quickly gives way to integrated representations that result from the rapid sharing of information across the corpus callosum. An exception to this integration process is provided by split brain patients who have had their corpus callosum severed (Myers and Sperry, 1958). This operation results in superior performance of split-brain patients compared to controls on several visual tasks, {{such as the ability}} to search for targets in the two visual fields simultaneously resulting in a doubling of search speed compared to controls (Luck, Hillyard, Mangun and Gazzaniga, 1989). In contrast, presenting bilateral displays to normal observers generally results in an advantage relative to unilateral presentation but one that is considerably less than the doubling of performance seen in split-brain patients. An exception to this rule was reported by Alvarez & Cavanagh (2005) who found that bilateral presentation in a multiple object tracking task (MOT) allowed observers to track twice as many objects relative to unilateral presentation. They suggested that the two cerebral hemispheres acted as independent object tracking systems in MOT. In the first experiment evidence for independent tracking systems were investigated. However, only a bilateral advantage that fell well short of the doubling of performance predicted by independent tracking systems was found. In a second experiment a population with extensive experience playing video games was compared to non-gamers on measures of independent tracking resources. Video gamers have increased visual skills in tasks such as MOT (Green and Bavelier, 2006). Our results show video gamers outperformed non-gamers during <b>bilateral</b> <b>tracking.</b> This suggests that some individual differences may be associated with the bilateral hemispheric advantage. However, evidence for completely independent resources in the two cerebral hemispheres is still lacking. Video gamers in our study only showed a <b>bilateral</b> advantage for <b>tracking</b> objects in two visual fields and not independence. Examining individual differences in a population shown to have high performance on MOT was insufficient to replicate results of Alvarez and Cavanagh (2005).

Here, we used multimodal and multivariate approaches to specifically examine age-related changes in task-related FC, gray-matter volumetrics, white-matter integrity, and performance. Our results are two-fold, showing (i) age-related differences in FC of the working memory network and (ii) age-related recruitment of a compensatory network associated with better accuracy on the task. Increased connectivity in the compensatory network correlates positively with preserved white-matter integrity in <b>bilateral</b> frontoparietal <b>tracks</b> and with larger gray-matter volume of right inferior parietal lobule.

40|$|Neurodegeneration {{accompanies the}} process of natural ageing, {{reducing}} the ability to perform functional daily activities. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) alters neuronal excitability and motor performance; however its beneficial effect on the induction of primary motor cortex (M 1) plasticity in older adults is unclear. Moreover, little is known {{as to whether the}} tDCS electrode arrangement differentially affects M 1 plasticity and motor performance in this population. In a double-blinded, cross-over trial, we compared unilateral, bilateral and sham tDCS combined with visuomotor tracking, on M 1 plasticity and motor performance of the non-dominant upper limb, immediately post and 30 minutes following stimulation. We found (a) unilateral and <b>bilateral</b> tDCS decreased <b>tracking</b> error by 12 - 22 % at both time points; with sham decreasing tracking error by 10 % at 30 minutes only, (b) at both time points, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were facilitated (38 - 54 %) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was released (21 - 36 %) for unilateral and bilateral conditions relative to sham, (c) there were no differences between unilateral and bilateral conditions for any measure. These findings suggest that tDCS modulated elements of M 1 plasticity, which improved motor performance irrespective of the electrode arrangement. The results provide preliminary evidence indicating that tDCS is a safe non-invasive tool to preserve or improve neurological function and motor control in older adults...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The medial {{forebrain}} bundle (MFB) {{is a key}} {{structure of}} the reward system and connects the ventral tegmental area (VTA) with the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC, lOFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies in major depressive disorder point to white matter alterations of regions which may be incorporated in the MFB. Therefore, it was the aim of our study to probe white matter integrity of the MFB using a DTI-based probabilistic fibre tracking approach. METHODS 22 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (12 melancholic-MDD patients, 10 non-melancholic-MDD patients) and 21 healthy controls underwent DTI scans. We used a <b>bilateral</b> probabilistic fibre <b>tracking</b> approach to extract pathways between the VTA and NACC, mOFC, lOFC, dlPFC respectively. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values were used to compare structural connectivity between groups. RESULTS Mean-FA did not differ between healthy controls and all MDD patients. Compared to healthy controls melancholic MDD-patients had reduced mean-FA in right VTA-lOFC and VTA-dlPFC connections. Furthermore, melancholic-MDD patients had lower mean-FA than non-melancholic MDD-patients in the right VTA-lOFC connection. Mean-FA of these pathways correlated negatively with depression scale rating scores. LIMITATIONS Due to {{the small sample size}} and heterogeneous age group comparisons between melancholic and non-melancholic MDD-patients should be regarded as preliminary. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the melancholic subtype of MDD is characterized by white matter microstructure alterations of the MFB. White matter microstructure is associated with both depression severity and anhedonia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTranscranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) modulates the excitability of {{neuronal}} {{responses and}} consequently can affect {{performance on a}} variety of cognitive tasks. However, the interaction between cognitive load and the effects of tDCS is currently not well-understood. We recorded the performance accuracy of participants on a <b>bilateral</b> multiple object <b>tracking</b> task while undergoing bilateral stimulation assumed to enhance (anodal) and decrease (cathodal) neuronal excitability. Stimulation was applied to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a region inferred to be at the centre of an attentional tracking network that shows load-dependent activation. 34 participants underwent three separate stimulation conditions across three days. Each subject received (1) left cathodal / right anodal PPC tDCS, (2) left anodal / right cathodal PPC tDCS, and (3) sham tDCS. The number of targets-to-be-tracked was also manipulated, giving a low (one target per visual field), medium (two targets per visual field) or high (three targets per visual field) tracking load condition. It was found that tracking performance at high attentional loads was significantly reduced in both stimulation conditions relative to sham, and this was apparent in both visual fields, regardless of the direction of polarity upon the brain’s hemispheres. We interpret this as an interaction between cognitive load and tDCS, and suggest that tDCS may degrade attentional performance when cognitive networks become overtaxed and unable to compensate as a result. Systematically varying cognitive load may therefore be a fruitful direction to elucidate the effects of tDCS upon cognitive functions...|$|R
40|$|An electroencephalographic (EEG) {{marker of}} the limited {{contents}} of human visual short-term memory (VSTM) has previously been described. Termed contralateral delay activity (CDA), this consists of a sustained, posterior, negative potential that correlates with memory load and is greatest contralateral to the remembered hemifield. The current investigation replicates this finding and uses magnetoencephalography (MEG) to characterise its magnetic counterparts and their neural generators as they evolve throughout the memory delay. A parametric manipulation of memory load, within and beyond capacity limits, allows separation of signals that asymptote with behavioural VSTM performance from additional responses that contribute to a linear increase with set-size. Both EEG and MEG yielded <b>bilateral</b> signals that <b>track</b> the number of objects held in memory, and contralateral signals that are independent of memory load. In MEG, unlike EEG, the contralateral interaction between hemisphere and item load is much weaker, suggesting that bilateral and contralateral markers of memory load reflect distinct sources to which EEG and MEG are differentially sensitive. Nonetheless, source estimation allowed both the bilateral and the weaker contralateral capacity-limited responses to be localised, along with a load-independent contralateral signal. Sources of global and hemisphere-specific signals all localised to the posterior intraparietal sulcus during the early delay. However the bilateral load response peaked earlier and its generators shifted later in the delay. Therefore the hemifield-specific response may be more closely tied to memory maintenance while the global load response {{may be involved in}} initial processing of a limited number of attended objects, such as their individuation or consolidation into memory...|$|R

Developed economies increasing their skilled and unskilled labor forces by 3 % raise the real incomes of their permanent residents. Most of those gains arise from the lifting of quotas on unskilled labor.

40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) is {{a surgical}} procedure {{that has been}} shown effective in improving the cardinal motor signs of advanced Parkinson's disease, however, declines in cognitive function {{have been associated with}} bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS. Despite the fact that most activities of daily living clearly have motor and cognitive components performed simultaneously, postoperative assessments of cognitive and motor function occur, in general, in isolation of one another. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of unilateral and bilateral STN DBS on upper extremity motor function and cognitive performance under single- and dual-task conditions in advanced Parkinson's disease patients. Data were collected from eight advanced Parkinson's disease patients between the ages of 48 and 70 years (mean 56. 5) who had bilaterally placed STN stimulators. Stimulation parameters for DBS devices were optimized clinically and were stable for at least 6 months prior to study participation. Data were collected while patients were Off anti-parkinsonian medications under three stimulation conditions: Off stimulation, unilateral DBS and bilateral DBS. In each stimulation condition patients performed a cognitive (n-back task) and motor (force tracking) task under single- and dual-task conditions. During dual-task conditions, patients performed the n-back and force-maintenance task simultaneously. Under relatively simple dual-task conditions there were no differences in cognitive or motor performance under unilateral and bilateral stimulation. As dual-task complexity increased, cognitive and motor performance was significantly worse with bilateral compared with unilateral stimulation. In the most complex dual-task condition (i. e. 2 -back + force <b>tracking),</b> <b>bilateral</b> stimulation resulted in a level of motor performance that was similar to the Off stimulation condition. Significant declines in cognitive and motor function under modest dual-task conditions with bilateral but not with unilateral STN DBS suggest that unilateral procedures may be an alternative to bilateral DBS for some patients, in particular, those with asymmetric symptomology. From a clinical perspective, these results underscore the need to assess cognitive and motor function simultaneously during DBS programming as these conditions may better reflect the context in which daily activities are performed...|$|R
