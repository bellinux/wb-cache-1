5|$|Despite being {{regularly}} overlooked for a {{place in}} the elite South Australian junior state squads, he continued to follow the rest of the squad to training sessions in order to learn alongside them. Harley's persistent attendance at training was rewarded when he was called up to the underâ€“18s squad as a late injury replacement a week prior to the National AFL Championships. Playing at centre half-back, Harley's performance in defence earned him end-of-year All-Australian honours and <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of AFL scouts.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Watson {{and some}} friends {{produced}} a newsletter to send to baseball players serving in the military. The newsletter <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of {{an editor at the}} Seattle Star (a now defunct daily newspaper) where Watson was hired to cover the Rainiers in 1944. It was while working at the Star that Watson contracted polio.|$|E
5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people and he brought out {{the worst in}} them... He clung {{to the idea of}} being 'tough'. He thought that was what had <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.|$|E

5|$|It is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the most important and pivotal of his early compositions because his performance of the song at an April 15, 1972, live radio concert at Sigma Studios on WMMR in Philadelphia, and the subsequent airplay this live version received on the station, <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of major record labels, including Columbia, with whom he would sign a recording contract in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{came to be}} {{appreciated}} as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning {{a living as a}} writer difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the BBC during the late 1940s <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public's attention, and he was frequently used by the BBC as a populist voice of the literary scene.|$|E
5|$|Born in Rome in 1783, Pistrucci studied {{briefly with}} other artists before {{striking}} {{out on his}} own at age 15. He became prominent as a cameo carver and was patronised by royalty. In 1815, he moved to Britain, where he would live for {{most of the rest of}} his life. His talent <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of notables including William Wellesley-Pole, the Master of the Mint. Pole engaged Pistrucci to design new coinage, including the sovereign, which was first issued in 1817 to mixed reactions. Although Pole probably promised Pistrucci the post of Chief Engraver, the position could not be awarded as only a British subject could hold it. This slight became a long-term grievance for Pistrucci.|$|E

5|$|Christy {{could have}} {{graduated}} in 1940, {{but could not}} then be a teaching assistant, and this would have left him jobless and without income. In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the physics department at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944, and Peter Robert, born in 1946. IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum. To keep abreast of developments in physics, he attended seminars at the University of Chicago. This <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of Eugene Wigner, who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 he {{debuted in}} film, {{but he only}} had modest success in the medium. He {{continued}} to perform in variety theatre in the inter-war years and, in 1932, starred in Helen!, his first straight theatre role. His appearance <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of many influential directors, including Sydney Carroll, who signed him to appear on stage as Falstaff in Henry IV, Part 1 in 1935, a role that he later repeated in Laurence Olivier's 1944 film, Henry V. During the Second World War, Robey raised money for charities and promoted recruitment into the forces. By the 1950s, his health had deteriorated, and he entered into semi-retirement. He was knighted {{a few months before}} his death in 1954.|$|E

Christopher Eccleston also later went on to achieve notoriety in a cult screen role when he appeared as the Ninth Doctor in the BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who in 2005. Since then various media articles have noted the coincidence of the future James Bond and Doctor Who leads having co-starred in the same production earlier in their careers.|$|E

5|$|Colbeck {{was born}} in Bradford and {{attended}} Pudsey Tyersal School. Bradford City youth team coach Jon Pepper <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club in 2002, and having rising through the junior ranks at City, Colbeck had barely featured for the reserves {{when he made his}} senior debut in a League Cup defeat to Notts County on 25 August 2004 at Valley Parade. It was his only first-team game during the season. It was another 17months before his next appearance for City when he was a late substitute on 7 January 2006 in a 1â€“0 defeat to Chesterfield. Colbeck broke into the team on a more regular basis and made 11appearances, including five starts, during {{the latter half of the}} 2005â€“06 season, and was one of six junior players to earn a one-year contract at the League One club.|$|E

5|$|Born {{into poverty}} in 1882, Hobbs wished {{from an early}} age to pursue a career in cricket. His early batting was undistinguished, but a sudden {{improvement}} in 1901 <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of local teams. In 1903 he successfully applied to join Surrey, with the support of England batsman Tom Hayward. His reputation grew and when he qualified to play for Surrey, he scored 88 on his first-class debut and a century in his next game. Over the following seasons, he established himself as a successful county player and in 1908 made his Test debut for England, scoring 83 in his first innings. After some mixed early performances for England, Hobbs' success against South African googly bowlers made his place secure, and by 1911â€“12, when he scored three centuries in the Test series against Australia, critics judged him the world's best batsman. In county cricket, he developed an attacking, dynamic style of play and was very successful up until 1914. After serving in the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, he maintained his reputation when cricket resumed in 1919, but his career was threatened by appendicitis, which caused him to miss most of the 1921 season. When he returned, he was a more cautious batsmen and used a safer style of play. Subsequently, he became more consistent and scored prolifically in both Test and domestic cricket until his retirement. In this period, he played some of his most acclaimed innings.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{independence}} from Britain in 1948, Burma had been fighting against ethnic unrest and Chinese Nationalist Kuomingtang irregulars, and several Burmese Army officers had trained in Australia in the 1950s. A Burmese staff officer, Major Muang Muang, later requested the assistance of Serong or another Australian officer. As a result Serong was sent to Burma as a counter-insurgency instructor with the Burmese armed forces, lecturing senior officers {{for a few months}} in 1957 before returning to Australia. Serong subsequently advocated the dispatch of a small team of Australian officers to assist in training the Burmese, but this did not occur. At the request of Muang Muang, Serong returned to Burma in 1960, serving in Rangoon as a strategic adviser to the Burmese armed forces. Muang Muang had resigned in early 1961, and as a consequence Serong's influence was limited from this time, During this period he worked to prepare the Burmese for a border war against China. While in Burma Serong's expertise <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and as a result he was later invited to supervise counter-insurgency programs in Vietnam. In February 1962 he wrote to Pollard, by then CGS, to suggest the deployment of a small team of Australian officers under his command to South Vietnam to work with the US advisory group there. Soon after the Burmese Army staged a coup, seizing control and moving the country towards communist China, after which Serong made arrangements to leave.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, he {{published}} his first novel, Carnuntum, in two volumes. Set {{in the late}} fourth century CE, the narrative focused on a romance set {{against the background of}} the conflict between Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire around the area of the eponymous Roman fort. The novel established List as a recognised figure within Austria's Pan-German community, a movement of individuals unified in their belief that the majority German-speaking areas of the multi-linguistic and multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian state should cede and join with the newly established German Empire. The book also <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of Friedrich Wannieck, a wealthy industrialist who was the chairman of both the Prague Iron Company and the First Brno Engineering Company. Wannieck was also president of the Verein 'Deutsches Haus' ("'German House' Association"), a nationalist organisation of linguistically German inhabitants of Brno who felt encircled by the largely Czech population of South Moravia.
