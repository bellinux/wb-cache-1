5|$|It is well {{understood}} that, {{at the moment}} {{it is only a}} minimum, the Society is always free to put in place the number of trains necessary to transport passengers who present themselves, that if it will satisfy this requirement, its proper interest is guaranteed, and, in giving greater public satisfaction, its infrastructure will be wisely used, instead of it travelling empty for part of the day to the detriment of its business. Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays, except Thursdays (racing), we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those going from the racecourse to the forest, but, concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse, it is imperative that the Chief Engineer (Lechelas) keeps the minimum to 30, otherwise there will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of abandonment of the line, because for this small distance, it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures.|$|E

5|$|Other {{ichthyosaur}} remains {{had been}} discovered in years past at Lyme and elsewhere, but the specimen found by the Annings {{was the first to}} come to the attention of scientific circles in London. It was purchased by the lord of a local manor, who passed it to William Bullock for public display in London where it created a sensation. At a time when most people in Britain still believed in a literal interpretation of Genesis, that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that species did not evolve or become extinct, the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the Earth. Its notoriety increased when Sir Everard Home wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock's museum. Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking {{it was a kind of}} fish, then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the duck-billed platypus (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which led him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus. By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck. Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819. The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the Natural History Museum in London (to which the fossil collections of the British Museum were transferred later in the century), but at some point, it became separated from the rest of the skeleton, the location of which is not known.|$|E

25|$|Empirical {{concepts}} are ultimately based on empirical perceptions. Kant, however, tried to claim that, analogously, pure concepts (Categories) {{also have a}} basis. This pure basis is supposed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of pure perception, which he called a schema. But such an empiricist analogy contradicts his previous rationalist assertion that pure concepts (Categories) simply exist in the human mind without having been derived from perceptions. Therefore, they are not based on pure, schematic perceptions.|$|E

25|$|More speculatively, the Higgs {{field has}} also been {{proposed}} as {{the energy of the}} vacuum, which at the extreme energies of the first moments of the Big Bang caused the universe to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of featureless symmetry of undifferentiated, extremely high energy. In this kind of speculation, the single unified field of a Grand Unified Theory is identified as (or modelled upon) the Higgs field, and it is through successive symmetry breakings of the Higgs field, or some similar field, at phase transitions that the presently known forces and fields of the universe arise.|$|E
25|$|An {{influx of}} Ca2+ ions into astrocytes is the {{essential}} change that ultimately generates calcium waves. Because this influx is directly caused {{by an increase in}} blood flow to the brain, calcium waves are said to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of hemodynamic response function. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration can propagate outwards through this functional syncytium. Mechanisms of calcium wave propagation include diffusion of calcium ions and IP3 through gap junctions and extracellular ATP signalling. Calcium elevations are the primary known axis of activation in astrocytes, and are necessary and sufficient for some types of astrocytic glutamate release.|$|E

Carter saw his ideas as rooted in Hindu advaita, in which the human experiences of separateness, duality and temporality are held to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of dance or play of cosmic consciousness in which everything is sacred, has absolute worth and is an end in itself. While his contemporary Jiddu Krishnamurti did not approve of Rajneesh, there are clear similarities between their respective teachings.|$|E

25|$|After the betrothal, Sarada {{was left}} {{to the care of}} her parents and Ramakrishna {{returned}} to Dakshineswar. Sarada next met Ramakrishna when she was fourteen years old, and she spent three months with him at Kamarpukur. There, Ramakrishna imparted to Sarada instructions on meditation and spiritual life. Ramakrishna's frequent bhava samadhi (ecstasy) and unorthodox ways of worship led some onlookers to doubt his mental stability, while others regarded him as a great saint. Sarada joined Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar in 1872 on her own accord when she was eighteen, after hearing these rumours about his mental health. She found Ramakrishna to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> and caring person.|$|E

In an interview following his induction into the Canadian Songwriters' Hall of Fame, Cohen explained that the album was intended to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of notebook or scrapbook of themes, and that a more formal record had been planned for release shortly afterwards, but that this was put on ice by his legal battles with his ex-manager.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{those within}} the same {{category}} (for example the four midfielders in a 4–4–2) would generally play as a fairly flat line across the pitch, with those out wide often playing in a slightly more advanced position. In many modern formations, {{this is not the}} case, which has led to some analysts splitting the categories in two separate bands, leading to four- or even five-numbered formations. A common example is 4–2–1–3, where the midfielders are split into two defensive and one offensive player; as such, this formation can be considered a type of 4–3–3. An example of a five-numbered formation would be 4-1-2-1-2, where the midfield consists of a defensive midfielder, two central midfielders and an offensive midfielder; this is sometimes considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of 4-4-2.|$|E

25|$|Maaseh Merkabah (Working of the Chariot) is {{the modern}} name {{given to a}} Hekhalot text, {{discovered}} by scholar Gershom Scholem. Works of the Chariot dates from late Hellenistic period, {{after the end of}} the Second Temple period following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE when the physical cult ceased to function. The idea of making a journey to the heavenly hekhal seems to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of spiritualization of the pilgrimages to the earthly hekhal that were now no longer possible. It is a form of pre-Kabbalah Jewish mysticism that teaches both of the possibility of making a sublime journey to God and of the ability of man to draw down divine powers to earth; it seems to have been an esoteric movement that grew out of the priestly mysticism already evident in the Dead Sea Scrolls and some apocalyptic writings (see the studies by Rachel Elior).|$|E
