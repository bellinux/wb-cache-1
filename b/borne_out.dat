5|$|Some {{commentators}} {{consider that}} the United States was a de facto member of OPEC during its formal occupation of Iraq, due to its leadership of the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003–2004. But this is not <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> by the minutes of OPEC meetings, as no US representative attended in an official capacity.|$|E
5|$|The Irish and British {{authorities}} co-operated in the chartering of ships. They made combined {{purchases of}} wheat, maize, sugar, animal feeds and petrol. At {{the start of}} the war, Irish ships joined convoys protected by the Royal Navy. The advantages were protection and cheaper insurance. These advantages were not <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> by experience. So they chose to sail alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{suggestion}} that her building had been sped up by using guns and/or turrets originally {{designed for the}} s which preceded her is not <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> as the guns and turrets were not ordered until July 1905.

5|$|Dioscorides then {{describes}} {{how to tell}} a good from a counterfeit preparation. He mentions the recommendations of other physicians, Diagoras (according to Eristratus), Andreas, and Mnesidemus, only to dismiss them as false and not <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> by experience. He ends {{with a description of}} how the liquid is gathered from poppy plants, and lists names used for it: chamaesyce, mecon rhoeas, oxytonon; papaver to the Romans, and wanti to the Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{was created}} by Thomas Haining Gillespie, a {{solicitor}} from Dumfries who dreamed of establishing a zoological park in Scotland. At first {{he was told that}} tropical animals {{would never be able to}} live in a cold climate like Edinburgh's—a view that had to some extent been <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> by the failure of the Royal Zoological Gardens. In 1908, though, he was encouraged to read of the pioneering methods employed by Carl Hagenbeck, which were allowing tropical animals to thrive in the recently opened Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, Germany.|$|E
5|$|Greater London's {{population}} declined {{steadily in}} the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6million in 1939 to around 6.8million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> of London's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s. The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea.|$|E

5|$|The Mikea are {{culturally}} and linguistically {{nearly identical to}} the neighboring Vezo fishing clan and Masikoro herding and farming clan of the Sakalava; only the traditional source of livelihood distinguishes the three groups. The popular association of the Mikea with the ancestral Vazimba clan has contributed to widespread belief that the Mikea possess Vazimba attributes, such as being small in stature, unclothed, shy and avoidant of contact with outsiders, and living in perfect harmony with the natural environment. None of these are <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> by evidence.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{entered the}} 1995 season after having {{finished}} with an 84 overall record in 1994. That season culminated with a 4523 loss to Tennessee in the 1994 Gator Bowl. Heading into the 1995 season, fans and coaches expected Tech {{to improve on}} its previous performance. Most commentators, however, expected a season comparable to 1994's: a second-place finish in the Big East {{and a trip to}} the Gator Bowl. This was <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> by the preseason college football polls. The AP Poll put Tech 24th, while the coaches' poll had Tech 26th.|$|E

5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of the blacktip shark were originally {{thought to be the}} graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides) and the spinner shark (C. brevipinna), due to similarities in morphology and behavior. However, this interpretation has not been <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> by studies of mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA, which instead suggest affinity with the blacknose shark (C. acronotus). More work is required to fully resolve the relationship between the blacktip shark and other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|Van Eyck {{does not}} shy from showing the {{physical}} {{effects of the}} canon's illness, including worn, crevassed and tired skin, weak vision, enlarged temporal arteries and swollen fingers. The awkwardness with which van der Paele clutches his breviary suggests weakness in his left arm; van de Paele probably suffered acute arm and shoulder pain, <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> by early 1430s church records documenting that he was excused from morning duties, and absent all day by 1434. His condition has been diagnosed by modern doctors as possibly polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.|$|E
5|$|After the Hokies' {{participation}} in the 2000 BCS National Championship Game, the Virginia Tech entered the 2000-2001 college football season with high expectations. Until late in the season, those hopes were <b>borne</b> <b>out,</b> and it appeared as if the Hokies {{would return to the}} national championship game. After a late-season loss to No.3-ranked Miami, however, Tech was knocked out of contention for the national title. Following the conclusion of its 10–1 season, No. 6 Tech was selected to participate in the Gator Bowl. Facing the Hokies were the No. 16 Clemson Tigers, who had finished 9–2 during the regular season.|$|E

5|$|After {{two years}} of poor {{attendance}} at ACC championship games in Tampa, Florida, organizers hoped moving the game to Charlotte, closer to the geographic center of the conference, would result in improved ticket sales. That hypothesis was <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> as early public sales approached 28,000 tickets before the participating teams were officially announced. After the announcement, each school sold its allotment of 10,000 tickets, and the more than 50,000 publicly available tickets were purchased at a rapid pace. ACC officials and Charlotte boosters each said they {{were satisfied with the}} pace and quantity of ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} Test and county matches during the 1948 tour, Johnston carried the {{heaviest}} workload, bowling nearly 200 overs {{more than any}} other squad member. He was the leading wicket-taker in all first-class matches with 102 wickets at 16.42, and the last Australian to take a century of wickets on a tour of England. His average was only slightly inferior to that of Lindwall, who took 86 wickets at 15.68. The roles Johnston fulfilled are <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> in his economy rate and strike rate. He was more economical than Miller and Lindwall, who took wickets more frequently.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{love for}} its eponymous {{locomotive}} was <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> when, in 1953, Birmingham's Museum of Science and Industry determined {{that when the}} opportunity arose it would like to acquire No. 46235. When the locomotive was withdrawn in October 1964, the opportunity {{was taken by the}} museum to purchase it. After successive spells at Crewe Works, Nuneaton, Crewe again (for cosmetic overhaul), Saltley depot and the Birmingham Lawley Street container terminal,the locomotive was finally moved to the museum in May 1966. At that time the building was still under construction and the building was completed until 1972.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> of ambitions {{to produce a}} viable combat {{aircraft}} that made use of the variable-sweep wing, {{as well as to}} promote wider cooperative efforts between France and the United Kingdom. However, neither Dassault not the French Air Force were particularly keen on the AFVG; the project was further impacted by repeated specification changes and indecision for what roles that the AFVG was to be tasked with on the part of Britain. In mid-1967, British requirements settled upon adopting the AFVG for the Royal Air Force (RAF) for the strike role in the place of the cancelled BAC TSR-2 strike bomber.|$|E
5|$|Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} concept of infant determinism (nature versus nurture), stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.|$|E
5|$|However, retired Colonel Thomas H. Taylor, a {{military}} historian, contended in his 1996 book {{that in spite}} of their original purpose of short range infiltration, the Eighth Army Ranger Company was employed well for the missions they conducted, most of which were reactionary and <b>borne</b> <b>out</b> of a need to rapidly counter North Korean and Chinese attacks. Taylor noted that particularly in their earlier missions, the Rangers had been successful at operating as a night combat force, a skill {{that the rest of the}} U.S. forces in Korea were largely untrained in. Taylor also believed that the Rangers, who were drawn from replacement and occupation units in Japan, effectively gave the 25th Infantry Division an extra force it would not otherwise have possessed, allowing it to employ its conventional forces elsewhere. Taylor praised division commander Major General William B. Kean for his employment of the Rangers, and argued that the successes of the subsequent Ranger companies validated the existence of the Eighth Army Ranger Company.|$|E
