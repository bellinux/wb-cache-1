5000|$|When a {{gas flow}} is {{introduced}} through {{the bottom of}} a bed of solid particles, it will move upwards through the bed via the empty spaces between the particles. At low gas velocities, aerodynamic drag on each particle is also low, and thus the bed remains in a fixed state. Increasing the velocity, the aerodynamic drag forces will begin to counteract the gravitational forces, causing the bed to expand in volume as the particles move away from each other. Further increasing the velocity, it will reach a critical value at which the upward drag forces will exactly equal the downward gravitational forces, causing the particles to become suspended within the fluid. At this critical value, the bed is said to be fluidized and will exhibit fluidic behavior. By further increasing gas velocity, the bulk density of the bed will continue to decrease, and its fluidization becomes more violent, until the particles no longer form a bed and are [...] "conveyed" [...] upwards by the gas flow. [...] When fluidized, a bed of solid particles will behave as a fluid, like a liquid or gas. Like water in a bucket: the bed will conform to the volume of the chamber, its surface remaining perpendicular to gravity; objects with a lower density than the <b>bed</b> <b>density</b> will float on its surface, bobbing up and down if pushed downwards, while objects with a higher density sink {{to the bottom of the}} bed. The fluidic behavior allows the particles to be transported like a fluid, channeled through pipes, not requiring mechanical transport (e.g. conveyor belt).|$|E

The axial <b>bed</b> <b>density,</b> particle volume fraction and particle velocity in the fluidized bed are predicted and compared with the experiments. The results indicate that there exist two different coexisting regions in the bed: a bottom dense and an upper dilute region. As increasing superficial gas velocity, <b>bed</b> <b>density</b> decreases in the dense phase whilst increases in the dilute phase. In this high and narrow turbulent fluidized bed, however, the <b>bed</b> <b>density</b> decreases sharply even in the dense phase because of the wall restriction.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation of air pressure drop while flowing through wheat straw beds. According to Darcy’s law, the smaller the porosity of the bed is, the bigger the pressure drop will be. The investigation was conducted using three different porosities (or three <b>bed</b> <b>densities),</b> and for two different air flow rates. After determining porosity (which is directly measurable), the permeability of straw could be found. For high flow velocities, such as the velocity of air flowing through a straw bale, the Forchheimer equation becomes more relevant as a correction of Darcy’s law with inertial effects included. Otherwise, the permeability tensor depends only on the geometry of the porous medium. With permeability known, the Forchheimer equation coefficients can be easily estimated. These results may be important for the future development of efficient biomass combustion facilities. The measurement methods and facility characteristics are described in more detail...|$|R

This study explores {{the impact of}} further decreasing the bulk density of a fairly typical ore blend. This was done by introducing small amounts of a very porous ore into the blend. Measured decreases in bulk density were up to 3 %. All the sinter quality parameters could be maintained or improved without the need to increase coke rate. Changes in sinter density results were not significant, indicating that the changes in <b>bed</b> bulk <b>density</b> {{did not have a}} significant effect on sinter porosity. The study was then extended to include a comparable blend and two hematite blends of higher bulk <b>density.</b> Decreasing green <b>bed</b> bulk <b>density,</b> <b>bed</b> shrinkage and sinter density did not have a detrimental effect on sinter tumble strength. The associated increase in porosity with the measured changes in sinter density is estimated to be up to 10 %. Results showed that sinter density values obtained for the low bulk density mixes at increased coke addition were still lower than equivalent values for the hematite mixes. As expected flame front speed was dependent on post-ignition airflow rate and both these parameters influence sinter strength. Many blends studied have binders and results indicated that their inclusion into sinter mixes gave increased post-ignition airflow values...|$|R

DesignAnalysis of routinely collected longitudinal data from 97, 627 patients who received ART through the Botswana National HIV/AIDS Treatment Program across all 24 health districts from 2002 to 2013. Doctors, nurses, and hospital <b>bed</b> <b>density</b> data at district-level were collected from various sources. MethodsA multilevel, longitudinal analysis method was used to analyze the data at both patient- and district-level simultaneously to measure the impact of the health system input at district-level on probability of death or loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) at the individual level. A marginal structural model was used to account for LTFU over time. ResultsIncreasing doctor density from one doctor to two doctors per 10, 000 population decreased the predicted probability of death for each patient by 27 %. Nurse density changes from 20 nurses to 25 nurses decreased the predicted probability of death by 28 %. Nine percent decrease was noted in predicted mortality of an individual in the Masa program for every five hospital <b>bed</b> <b>density</b> increase.

40|$|AbstractThe {{measurement}} of the local concentration of suspended particles within settling multiphase systems is important to many engineering applications; particularly for example in gravitational thickeners used extensively in minerals processing and water treatment. The ability to monitor concentration and stratification in situ may greatly aid in developing efficient separators and allow more accurate modeling of these processes. Acoustic backscatter systems (ABS) are a practical and relatively inexpensivecharacterization technique, {{with the ability to}} profile particle concentration as a function of depthin operationalenvironments. Currently, such instruments are only used for sedimentology studies in dilute estuarine flows as their application in concentrated industrial suspensions is significantly more complicated and largely unstudied. A novel application is reported herein investigating the use of an ABS to characterize a model mineral separation system, utilizing a bespoke continuous flow laboratory scale thickener with inline pipe flocculator. A 1 MHz probe mounted in the near-bed region of the thickener was used to measure consolidated bed build-up and segmented density changes from the signal decay. Importantly, the influence of a scraper-rake on solids densification was observed by analyzing systems at two different scraper rotation speeds (0. 1 and 1. 1 rpm). An optimal rotation speed was observed that led to enhanced underflow solids fractions. Higher speeds led to an assumed fluidization of the bed from secondary flows, which reduced <b>bed</b> <b>densities</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} scraper...|$|R

The second program compared coalescence using 19 to 21 mm sinter from eight different pot tests and blends containing significant porous ores. For the same ore blend sintered under different conditions, measured trends in sinter density and porosity were in line with expectations but the changes were not large because the material in sinter has a high specific gravity of over four and changes in porosity were less than 5 %.

Research on littoral microfauna has to date focused mainly on field observations, which commonly show microfauna have preference for some macrophytes over others. However, while such studies commonly conclude that macrophyte architecture is a major determinant of these variations, independent factors may also be responsible (e. g., differences in macrophyte ages, differences in macrophyte <b>bed</b> <b>densities</b> and the depth of the respective macrophyte beds sampled). We used artificial macrophytes with three levels of complexity to keep the surface area and mass of the substrate sampled constant, and to control for confounding factors not related to the complexity of the plants. Our results support {{the hypothesis that}} structural complexity is an important factor influencing abundance and taxon richness, independent of other potential confounding factors. Microfaunal (mainly rotifer) abundance and richness were generally greater on more complex artificial macrophytes, likely a result of more complex substrates (1) providing a greater variety of habitat, (2) supporting a greater concentration or variety of food and/or (3) affording greater protection against predators. Less mobile surface-associated (i. e., benthic/periphytic) taxa were found to discriminate among substrates, whereas the abundance and richness of planktonic species were not affected by complexity level.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the rates of outpatient cataract surgery (ROCS) in ten European countries and to find country-specific health indicators explaining the differences. METHODS: Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), 251 eligible respondents were identified for which cataract surgery was the last surgical procedure. The ROCS of ten countries were compared using logistic regression. The influence of the public expenditure on health as per cent of the total expenditure on health, of the number of acute care beds per 1, 000 population, and of the number of practicing physicians per 1, 000 population, was studied by multiple logistic regression. Additional information was obtained from country-specific opinion leaders in the field of cataract surgery. RESULTS: The ROCS differed significantly between the ten analysed European countries where Denmark had the highest (100 %) and Austria the lowest (0 %) rate of day care surgery. A decrease in the density of acute care beds (p < 0. 0000001) and in the density of practicing physicians (p < 0. 05) and an increase in the public expenditure on health as per cent of the total health expenditure (p < 0. 01) lead to an increase in the ROCS.

The passively aerated composting process was simulated in one-dimensional reactors of 2 m 3 for straw-rich manure with compost <b>bed</b> <b>densities</b> of 1100, 700 and 560 kg m- 3. Temperature profiles over the reactor height were monitored online and ammonia emissions were measured periodically. The composition of the compost bed over the reactor height was determined {{at the end of}} the composting process. The composting process strongly depends on the density of the compost <b>bed.</b> At a <b>density</b> of 1100 kg. m- 3, the porosity of the bed is too is to low to initiate natural convection, and aerobic degradation fails and anaerobic conditions may lead to emissions of methane and odorous compounds. At a density of 560 kg. m- 3, the porosity of the bed is high and the high rate of natural convection will keep the temperature low thereby preventing the removal of pathogens and weeds. Best results were observed at a density of 700 kg. m- 3 for which aerobic degradation and drying were adequate and temperatures were high enough to kill pathogens and weeds. On basis of the Ergun equation, which describes the airflow in porous media with internal heat generation, this corresponds to a compost bed permeability of 7 x 10 - 8 m 2. It was also shown that it is possible to compost animal manures with a low C/N ratio without significant emissions of ammonia. This can be established by trapping the initial ammonia emissions in a straw filter, which is placed on top of the compost bed. Ammonia absorbed in the straw filter and in the compost bed were removed by nitrification and denitrification. The passively aerated composting system results in a compost bed which is highly heterogeneous with respect to temperature, oxygen level and its composition. It is proposed that in this way a highly diverse microbial community in the compost bed is established which can perform various microbial conversions. The extensive composting system is most promising for on-farm production of an organic fertilizer from straw-rich manure, since the costs of the process and the level of ammonia emissions were low...|$|R

Three species of seagrass were found at the study sites in northern Biscayne Bay: Thalassia testudinum, Halodule wrightii, and Syringodium filiforme. This study focused on understanding the organism habitat interaction by determining the species diversity, seasonal densities, and the correlation between population size and individual size for Penaeid shrimp, juvenile fish, and small adult fish at each site over a one year period.

In previous non-spatial analyses, population-level socioeconomic and health resource characteristics have explained {{little of the}} variation in rates. This study examines geographic variation in hospitalization rates for low back problems while controlling for spatial dependence in the data. County-level surgical and medical hospitalization rates were calculated using North Carolina hospital (USA) discharge data from 1990 - 92. Non-spatial and spatial regression models were estimated using socioeconomic and health resource predictors. Both surgical and medical rates varied significantly among the 100 counties. Non-spatial models explained 62 % of variation in log-transformed surgical rates and 66 % of variation in log-transformed medical rates; however, residuals showed significant spatial dependence. Spatial lag models were therefore applied. Using simple contiguity spatial weights, surgery rates increased with higher percent urban population, primary care physician density, and discharge rate for other causes, and decreased with higher percent college graduates, percent disabled, occupied hospital <b>bed</b> <b>density,</b> and unoccupied hospital <b>bed</b> <b>density.</b> There was a nonlinear relationship between surgery rates and percent employed in heavy lifting/transportation industries. Medical rates increased with higher other-cause discharge rate and with MRI/CT scanner availability, and decreased with higher percent urban population, percent nonwhite population, percent in heavy lifting/transportation industries, and unoccupied hospital <b>bed</b> <b>density.</b> The results show that population-level socioeconomic and health resource characteristics are important determinants of variation in low back hospitalization rates.

40|$|Convolute {{lamination}} is {{a common}} fold structure within turbidite beds, attributed to the deformation of sediment during or soon after deposition of the host bed. Despite the prevalence of this feature, the formational processes are still not well understood. Possible mechanisms are investigated here through redescription and analysis of convolute lamination from the Aberystwyth Grits Group (Silurian, west Wales, UK), in which "convolute bedding" was first defined. Internal bed structures have been studied in clean coastal exposures and on high-resolution optical scans of cut surfaces. Convolute lamination occurs in intervals 2 - 10 cm thick, spanning {{the top of the}} very fine sand Bouma C division through the D division of interlaminated silt and clay. Observed growth geometries confirm that the structure formed during sedimentation of the host graded bed. Folds show a down-flow asymmetry and doubly-vergent diapiric geometries ("mushroom"-shaped structures). Grain size measurements from a modern turbidite (Icod bed, ~ 165 ka, Mor occan Turbidite System) suggest there is an optimal 'window' of average grain size and mud content parameter space, within which convolute lamination develops. It is proposed that this window coincides with a <b>bed</b> <b>density</b> inversion created during deposition of a graded bed as clean sand (with pore spaces infilled by water) fines upwards into mud-rich sand (with pores infilled by an increasing proportion of mud). Porosity decreases and bulk <b>bed</b> <b>density</b> correspondingly increases. The resulting unstable density gradient may lead to vertical buoyancy-driven overturn, manifest as growing folds. Subsequent amplification of the folds due to density differences and modification due to horizontal shear imposed by the depositing turbidity current may then occur.

Department of Energy’s Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC) has {{developed}} a multi-level capacitance imaging system (CIS) for imaging flow patterns in its fluidized-bed research program. The CIS measures displacement current across a cold fluidized bed and provides researchers with a 3 -Dimensional realtime display of <b>bed</b> <b>density</b> estimates while simultaneously recording data for post-run analysis. The CIS has evolved from a single level, 16 -electrode, 49 -pixel system to the present four-level, 32 -electrode, 193 -pixel system...|$|E
40|$|Ignition in a {{fuel bed}} where the {{ignition}} front propagates against the air flow is studied by modelling and through experiments. The model can predict the observed trends when moisture, <b>bed</b> <b>density</b> and air rate change. Geometrical factors, such as particle shape, size and orientation are combined {{to a single}} radiation parameter, {{which can be found}} experimentally. The main factors affecting ignition speed are the fuel moisture content, fuel volatile content, air flow rate through the bed, air temperature, the bulk density of the fuel bed, particle size, and particle shape. Up to the present most experiments have been carried out with homogenous and rather symmetric particles or with small particle size variation. This is not the case in many actual burners. Some of the measured flame spread rates were high compared to the results from literature, caused by the small bulk density of the bed and the thin particles of the tested fuels. Also wide particle size distribution may increase the ignition velocity. The ignited mass flow rate of dry solids per unit area of the bed (velocity of the ignition front ´ <b>bed</b> <b>density)</b> is an important parameter when designing combustion equipment, since it is proportional to the combustion rate of the volatiles/grate area...|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{introduced}} eelgrass Zostera japonica as {{a refuge}} from epibenthic predators ~ 5 S invest 1 gated. Caging experiments were employed inside and outside eelgrass <b>beds.</b> and <b>density</b> of the spionid polychaetes were determined. A 2 -way analysis of variance showed that spionid density is dependent on several factors: site. season. caging treatment. and {{the presence or absence}} of ~ japonica. Four species were common: Pygospio elegans. Streblospio benedicti. Pseudopolydora kempi. and Boccardia truncata. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to compare spionid densities inside and outside eelgrass beds. and to determine which species contribute to the significant effect in the three sites. Two sites showed significant effects. The four most common spionids showed significantly higher <b>densities</b> inside eelgrass <b>beds.</b> The exclusion of epibenthic predators was correlated with the relative abundance patterns of spionids in the control and exclusion plots...|$|R
50|$|The New Zealand scallop {{is a large}} fan-shaped shellfish, flat on {{one side}} and convex on the other. It lives on the bottom of coastal waters, 30 metres or more deep. Scallop spat-collecting bags are {{suspended}} during summer in coastal areas with high natural scallop settlement. The scallop larvae settle out of the plankton onto the fine feathery surface of the plastic mesh bags. The larvae are allowed to grow to a suitable size and are then released onto known natural scallop <b>beds</b> at <b>densities</b> of about six per square metre of sea floor. There, they are later harvested on a rotational basis by dredges. This technique has resulted in a marked increase and stabilising of the available annual catch. The Tasman scallop fishery, near collapse in the 1980s, recovered with re-seeding to a level where 747 tonnes were harvested in 2004.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of seagrass meadows as a habitat for fishes, including several of economic importance, is widely acknowledged. The complexity of seagrass beds might offer a different condition of habitat for fishes. The physical {{nature of the}} seagrass canopy is thought {{to play a major}} role, potentially influencing available shelter, food, and protection from predators. Structural complexity of seagrass such as shoot and leaf density is also an important factor in determining ecological function of seagrass in the marine environment. The objective of the research is to assess the ecological function of different seagrass beds (in terms of spesies and density) in supporting fish community. The study found 28 species of fish originating from 14 families and Pomacentridae were dominantly found. Abundance of fish found to be higher in seagrass <b>beds</b> with high <b>densities</b> both composed by one species of seagrass (monospesific) or by more than one species of seagrass (multispesific), compared to the seagrass <b>beds</b> with low <b>density</b> and bare areas. Fish community diversity index was found higher in dense seagrass beds composed of many species of seagrass compared to the rare and consists of only one species of seagrass. The presence of epiphytes as nutrients for the fish that live in seagrass beds may contribute to the finding...|$|R
