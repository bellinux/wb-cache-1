We also found that MC participants overall rated the test words with higher emotion intensity than both HK and SG participants (p[*]<[*]. 001 <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>paired</b> t tests; see Table  7 for by-region summaries), suggesting possible cross-regional differences in the perception of emotion intensity, although it is unclear at this stage what may have caused such differences.|$|R

40|$|The paired {{catchments}} {{with the}} same basin size and meteorological condition but different geology were selected to compare the fresh submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) rate observed by seepage meters with value calculated from water balance method in Kumamoto, Japan. The fresh SGD rate decreases with {{the distance from the}} coast, on the other hands, recirculated saline SGD is higher at near shore due to wave set-up and at offshore due to tidal pumping. The spatial integrations of fresh SGD agree well with the water budget <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>paired</b> catchments. The difference of fresh component of SGD between two catchments may be caused by the difference of geology in the study area...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{data from}} 76 {{informative}} families, linkages between Pa and Pr and between Pr and Db have been established by two-point linkage analysis. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>pairs</b> of loci, {{there were no significant}} sex heterogeneity in recombination fractions. Linkage between Pa and Db cannot be established based on two-point analyses, but a significant sex difference in the recombination fraction between Pa and Db was observed. Strong confirming evidence was obtained from three-point analysis to place Pa, Pr, and Db in one linkage group. The most likely order is Pa-Pr-Db, but the relative odds over second order Pr-Pa-Db are small. Haplotype frequencies of Pr, Pa, and Db were obtained based on the phenotypes of the 685 random Caucasians, providing evidence for marked linkage disequilibrium among the three loci...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{dorsiflexion}} was investigated on range of passive straight leg raising (SLR) and on inter-rater reliability with 35 patients reporting unilateral lumbar pain {{with or without}} ipsilateral leg symptoms. Ranges of SLR and SLR with dorsiflexion (SLR/DF) to onset of lumbar or leg symptoms (P 1) were independently measured using a gravity goniometer by pairs of different physiotherapists at two clinics. Dorsiflexion significantly reduced SLR range by a mean of 9 degrees across both samples. Similar high inter-rater reliability was found for SLR and SLR/DF <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>pairs</b> of physiotherapists.
