5|$|Jack {{receives}} {{a call from}} Hughes to say that Bradley {{is about to be}} arrested and urges Bradley to leave Walford as quickly as possible. Bradley and Stacey quickly pack their bags at home. Max Branning (Jake Wood) says an emotional goodbye to his son and Jack agrees to help them escape. They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and hide a few streets away. Jack also leaves <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> door but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet Bradley and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. Bradley says they should go without Jack, but when they go to get a taxi to St Pancras railway station, Bradley realises he has left the passports at home and goes back to get them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he runs up a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. He shouts at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from the roof to the ground, dying instantly. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body. She tells him it is her fault, as Bradley did not kill Archie, she did. The following day, Marsden says the police will no longer be pursuing the investigation. Stacey then goes missing, and on the day of Bradley's funeral, Jack receives news that a court has found Bradley guilty of Archie's murder.|$|E
25|$|For example, if two musicians, one {{standing}} on the front sideline of the football field {{and one on the}} back sideline, begin playing exactly when they see the beat of the conductor's baton or hand, the sound produced by the musician on the front sideline reaches listeners in the stands noticeably before the sound played <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> musician, and the musicians is seen to move before the sound reaches the stands.|$|E

Paterno was angered that Penn State wide receiver Tony Johnson caught a pass with both feet in bounds according to the stadium's video replay board, but the play was ruled an incompletion.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, Horsfall's cricket was {{affected}} {{for the first}} time <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> injury that would plague the rest of his career. He appeared in only six first-class matches, and though he returned to just over half of Essex's matches in 1950, his batting was less successful. His only century in these two seasons came in a match against the Combined Services. In 1951, however, he was fully fit and, playing in every Essex match, he made 1655 runs at an average of 35.21. His best score was 206, made in 270 minutes against Kent at Blackheath, and he shared a third wicket partnership of 343 with Paul Gibb which was the Essex county record until beaten by Mark Waugh and Nasser Hussain, who made an unbroken 347 against Lancashire in 1992. The 206 remained Horsfall's highest first-class score and was his only double-century.|$|E

Nexus, which owns and manages Metro, contracted out operations and train maintenance {{as part of}} a deal with the UK Government to secure modernisation investment and operating subsidy for the system between 2010 and 2021. Nexus continued to set fares, set frequency of services and Metro operating hours. Opponents say this was privatisation <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> door, though some services had already been contracted out, such as cleaning of stations and ticket inspections. On 3 November 2008, Nexus invited potential bidders to declare an interest in a contract to run the operations side of the business on its behalf. The successful bidder was to obtain a seven-year contract commencing on 1 April 2010, with up to an additional two years depending on performance. In February 2009 four bids were shortlisted; DB Regio, MTR Corporation, Serco-Abellio, and an in-house bid by Metro. By October 2009 the shortlist had been reduced to bids from DB Regio and Nexus. In December 2009, DB Regio was named as the preferred bidder. The contract for operating the system was signed on 2 February 2010, and the service was handed over to DB Regio on 1 April 2010.|$|E
25|$|Bengal tigers {{occasionally}} prey on sloth bears. Tigers usually give sloth bears a wide berth, {{though some}} specimens may become habitual bear killers {{and it is}} not uncommon to find sloth bear fur in tiger scats. Tigers typically hunt sloth bears by waiting for them near termite mounds, then creeping behind them and seizing them <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of their necks and forcing them to the ground with their weight. One tiger was reported to simply break its victim's back with its paw, then wait for the paralysed bear to exhaust itself trying to escape before going in for the kill. When confronted by tigers face to face, sloth bears charge at them, crying loudly. A young or already sated tiger usually retreats from an assertive sloth bear, as the bear's claws can inflict serious wounds, and most tigers end the hunt if the bears become aware of the tiger's presence before the pounce. A female bear with cubs was observed to stand her ground and prevail in a confrontation against two tigers (one female, one male) in rapid succession. Sloth bears may scavenge on tiger kills. As tigers are known to mimic the calls of sambar deer to attract them, sloth bears react fearfully even to the sounds made by deer themselves. Indian leopards can also be a threat, as they are able to follow sloth bears up trees. Sloth bears occasionally chase leopards from their kills.|$|E
25|$|The {{regular season}} {{concluded}} with the match in Columbus, {{and the result}} matched the all-time worst in United's team history. The United attack hardly ever threatened, but it was shoddy work <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> line that really did in the team, as a 5-0 loss dropped the team into 4th place. That left United as host for a midweek 'play-in' match at home against a New England Revolution team that finished {{the season with a}} convincing 3-1 win at NYCFC. On a rainy day in the D.C. area, one of the smallest crowds of the year turned out to watch what proved {{to be one of the}} most entertaining games in the MLS season. Typical of the 2015 edition of the team, D.C. United fell behind in the first 15 minutes, but it was hard to fault the quality of a spectacular bicycle goal by New England's Juan Agudelo. Following the goal, the Revolution continued to press but Hamid was able to keep United in the match with some big saves. United leveled the score on a free kick in the 45th minute, as Pontius scored on a header set-up by Espindola's service. Pontius would have to leave the game in the second half, due to hamstring tightness. The D.C. team missed a chance to go ahead in the 75th minute, when Rolfe failed to convert a penalty kick, striking the inside of the post. Rolfe, however, got redemption, scoring in the 83rd minute, finishing off a cutback centering pass from Espindola, DeLeon was also credited with an assist for his nifty back-heel that set-up Espindola's run to the end line. Another spectacular save by Hamid denied a header bid by Revolution's Jermaine Jones in the late-going. The game ended on a controversial note, as Jermaine Jones was shown a red card for grabbing the referee while protesting the decision not to award a penalty kick for an apparent handball against United defender Sean Franklin in the 92nd minute. United had led the league with 8 comeback victories during the regular season, so the comeback win was a fitting way to kick off the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs.|$|E

500|$|For the defence, Robin Grey QC, {{explained}} to the jury that such was the extent of Hodgson's compulsive lying that he had confessed to 200 different crimes, including murders that had not happened.

When the deceased returned to her car she put her handbag onto {{the back seat and}} brushed against [...] He seized her <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of her jumper, twisted it and strangled her, and when she was dead or dying he raped her, removing her underwear and tights with such force that one leg of the tights was torn from the other.

Also on 19 September, UK Prime Minister David Cameron established the Smith Commission to look at the prospect of devolving further powers to Scotland. Chaired by Lord Smith of Kelvin, the cross-party Commission published its findings on 27 November. Among its recommendations were proposals to give the Scottish Parliament responsibility for some welfare payments and for setting income tax levels.
