5|$|Plutonium-239 and 240 emit {{ionizing}} radiation {{in the form}} of alpha particles. Inhalation is the primary pathway by which plutonium enters the body, though plutonium can also enter the body through a wound. Once inhaled, plutonium increases the risk of lung cancer, liver cancer, <b>bone</b> <b>cancer,</b> and leukemia. Once absorbed into the body, the biological half life of plutonium is about 200 years.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{strontium}} is {{a mixture}} of four stable isotopes: 84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr, and 88Sr. Their abundance increases with increasing mass number and the heaviest, 88Sr, makes up about 82.6% of all natural strontium, though the abundance varies due to the production of radiogenic 87Sr as the daughter of long-lived beta-decaying 87Rb. Of the unstable isotopes, the primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 85Sr is electron capture or positron emission to isotopes of rubidium, and that of the isotopes heavier than 88Sr is electron emission to isotopes of yttrium. Of special note are 89Sr and 90Sr. The former has a half-life of 50.6days and is used to treat <b>bone</b> <b>cancer</b> due to strontium's chemical similarity and hence ability to replace calcium. While 90Sr (half-life 28.90years) has been used similarly, it is also an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents due to its production as a fission product. Its presence in bones can cause <b>bone</b> <b>cancer,</b> cancer of nearby tissues, and leukemia. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated about 30,000km2 with greater than 10 kBq/m2 with 90Sr, which accounts for 5% of the core inventory of 90Sr.|$|E

5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to see other markers present on the bones. Past {{fractures}} will be evident {{by the presence of}} bone remodeling. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as <b>bone</b> <b>cancer</b> might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, 1995 Tkach {{had surgery}} to remove his gall bladder. Shortly thereafter, he was readmitted to the {{hospital}} because of severe intestine and back pain. Surgeons then removed a grapefruit-size tumor from his intestines and discovered he had colon cancer. In a letter to ministers, dated September 6, Tkach {{announced that he was}} also diagnosed with <b>bone</b> <b>cancer.</b> He elected not to undertake radiation treatments. As Armstrong had done before him, Tkach named a successor to become pastor general in the event of his death. In that case, it was Tkach's son, Joseph Tkach Jr.|$|E
5|$|Banister {{attended}} La Marque High School in La Marque, Texas. At La Marque, Banister {{played for}} the school's baseball, basketball, and American football teams. During his sophomore year of high school, Banister injured his right ankle while playing baseball. During an examination of his ankle, which was slow to heal, {{he was diagnosed with}} <b>bone</b> <b>cancer.</b> He had developed cysts that required skin grafting to treat. An infection in his leg {{led to the development of}} osteomyelitis, which spread from his right ankle to just below his knee. Doctors recommended amputation in order to save the rest of his leg, but Banister refused, as he hoped he would be able to continue his baseball career. Doctors performed seven operations on his leg, which saved it from being amputated. In his senior year, Banister suffered a knee injury playing American football, which nearly led to him being cut from the baseball team due to his decreased mobility. His father suggested he change positions and become a catcher, which allowed him to remain on the baseball team.|$|E
40|$|Primary and {{secondary}} <b>bone</b> <b>cancers</b> are major causes of pathological bone fractures {{which are usually}} treated through implant fixation and chemotherapy. However, both approaches face many limitations. On one hand, implants may suffer from poor osseointegration, and their rejection results in repeated surgery, patient's suffering, and extensive expenses. On the other hand, there are severe systemic adverse effects of toxic chemotherapeutics which are administrated systemically. In this paper, {{in order to address}} these two problems, we present a new type of localized drug-releasing titanium implants with enhanced implants' biointegration and drug release capabilities that could provide a high concentration of anticancer drugs locally to treat <b>bone</b> <b>cancers.</b> The implants are fabricated by 3 D printing of Ti alloy followed by an anodization process featuring unique micro- (particles) and nanosurface (tubular arrays) topography. We successfully demonstrate their enhanced bone osseointegration and drug loading capabilities using two types of anticancer drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo 2 L/TRAIL). In vitro study showed strong anticancer efficacy against cancer cells (MDA-MB- 231 -TXSA), confirming that these drug-releasing implants can be used for localized chemotherapy for treatment of primary {{and secondary}} <b>bone</b> <b>cancers</b> together with fracture support.

5|$|Banister played {{baseball}} at La Marque High School in La Marque, Texas. He developed <b>bone</b> <b>cancer</b> in his sophomore year, which almost necessitated the amputation of his leg. While playing college baseball for Lee College, {{he suffered a}} home plate collision that broke three vertebrae in his neck, leaving him paralyzed for ten days. After rehabilitating, he was named a Junior College All-American the next season, and received a scholarship to the University of Houston, {{to play for the}} Houston Cougars baseball team. He was then drafted by the Pirates in 1986. After playing in Minor League Baseball, he appeared in a major league game on July 23, 1991, recording a hit in his only plate appearance. He did not appear in another major league game, and ended his playing career after the 1993 season.|$|E
5|$|Further tragedy soon {{followed}} when Victoria's son, George, died of <b>bone</b> <b>cancer</b> the following year. Her granddaughter, Lady Pamela Hicks, remembered her grandmother's tears. In World War II Victoria was bombed out of Kensington Palace, and {{spent some time}} at Windsor Castle with King George VI. Her surviving son, Louis, and two of her grandsons served in the Royal Navy, while her German relations fought with the opposing forces. She {{spent most of her}} time reading and worrying about her children; her daughter, Alice, remained in occupied Greece and was unable to communicate with her mother for four years {{at the height of the}} war. After the Allied victory, her son, Louis, was offered the post of Viceroy of India, but she was deeply opposed to his accepting, knowing that the position would be dangerous and difficult. He accepted anyway.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo analyze breast <b>cancer</b> <b>bone</b> {{metastasis}} related gene-CXCR 4. MethodsThis research screened breast <b>cancer</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis related genes by high-flux gene chip.

The expression of chemokine receptor CXCR 4 was obviously up-regulated in the tissue with breast <b>cancer</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis. Compared with the tissue without bone metastasis, there was significant difference, which indicated that CXCR 4 played a vital role in breast <b>cancer</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis. ConclusionsThe bioinformatics analysis of CXCR 4 can provide a certain basis for the occurrence and diagnosis of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis, target gene therapy and evaluation of prognosis...|$|R
