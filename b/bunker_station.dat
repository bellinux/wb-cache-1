50|$|Tjøme {{municipality}} {{is completely}} located on islands, the main island being the Tjøme island, where Kirkebygda (the community center) is located, {{along with the}} shops, schools and restaurants. There are a few other central areas on the islands such as Hvasser, with active fishermen {{as well as the}} tourist industry for the bypassing travellers, with an icebar, shops, <b>bunker</b> <b>station</b> petrol station, and a number of places to buy food and supplies.|$|E
50|$|The 1920s {{also brought}} about {{a major change in}} the Dutch {{industrial}} sector: a slump in fishing led to the consolidation of three major shipping companies and their new energy needs also affected the SHV. In response to these changes, SHV established its first oil <b>bunker</b> <b>station</b> and sold crude for the motor vessels of the recently merged shipping companies. The shifts in energy economics in the Netherlands followed changes taking place around the world. In 1914, close to 94% of ships around the world were fuelled by coal; by 1939 this had fallen to 48%. Oil was preferred over coal because it burned more efficiently: in some cases, shipping companies saved up to 40% in operating costs by switching to motor vessels.|$|E

50|$|The novel {{opens with}} Sheila Grey, George’s {{daughter}} and her partner, Tom, discussing the imminent return of her father from Bom Porto. In a letter, he tells her of his plans to retire to his parents’ house in St Cadix, Cornwall. The action then moves to Bom Porto, the capital of Montedor - an independent Marxist Republic - where we first meet George, who is {{the manager of a}} <b>bunkering</b> <b>station.</b> He plays a game of squash with Eduordo (Teddy) Duarte, the Minister of Communications, who informs him about the President’s plans to use Cubans to subjugate the mountainous Wolofs, a tribe who have historically been hostile towards the coastal Creole population. George later settles his affairs and is given a surprise official send-off and eventually arrives in Britain, booking himself into a Post House Hotel at Heathrow rather than choosing to stay with Sheila.|$|R

30|$|From {{case studies}} on a {{different}} ships, {{it was concluded that}} an SCR[*]+[*]scrubber is the correct solution for a tanker operating rarely inside ECAs (17  % of total time) where fuel costs are clearly the highest annual cost because of the relatively low cost of ships and crew, etc. The total increase in annual cost of 1.7  % (CAPEX[*]+[*]OPEX) with this option is already compensated for by a 2  % drop in bunker fuel costs. For a cruise ship, operating about 40  % of the time in an ECA, the best lifecycle costs are given when changing to Dual Fuel engines operating on LNG. This would have a payback time of 0.8  years with the assumed fuel and installation prices. The drawbacks would be the larger fuel tanks needed, and thus less passenger capacity, as well as the dependency on having LNG <b>bunkering</b> <b>station</b> availability around the world. But as more capacity is built, the trend is clearly moving towards LNG as a valid option for cruise ships and other ships operating fairly much in ECAs. Furthermore, a DF engine is fully capable of running on any liquid fuel in case no LNG is available.|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{interests in}} using LNG as a marine fuel, safety issues for LNG bunkering have brought about global discussion on establishing a safety exclusion zone around LNG bunkering areas. However, international consensus {{has yet to}} be reached in determining an appropriate extent of the zone to ensure safe liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify potential risks of LNG bunkering and to present a statistical method for determining the safe exclusion zone around LNG <b>bunkering</b> <b>station</b> with the help of a purpose-built computer program, integrated quantitative risk assessment (IQRA). A probabilistic risk assessment approach was adopted in this study to determine the safety exclusion zone for two case ships: one, a 300, 000 DWT very large ore carrier (VLOC) and the other a 32, 000 DWT bulk carrier. The results are then compared with those obtained by a deterministic approach and the discrepancies are discussed. It was found from this study that the frequency of bunkering is one of the key factors in determining the extent of safety exclusion zone. Thus, a somewhat surprising result of 36 m radius safety exclusion zone for the 32, 000 DWT bulk carrier compared to 6. 4 m radius for the 300, 000 DWT VLOC was obtained. It was also found that the deterministic approach produced a much more extensive safety exclusion zone for the 300, 000 DWT VLOC subjected to infrequent large-scale LNG bunkering operations compared to the probabilistic approach, while it was reasonably consistent with the probabilistic approach for the 32, 000 DWT bulk carrier which uses frequent small-scale bunkering...|$|R

50|$|Naval Reserve Air Base Peru, as {{the base}} was named when commissioned, was built to train Navy, United States Marine Corps and United States Coast Guard pilots. The base would go through several names just during WWII. On 1 January 1943, the name was changed to Naval Air Station Peru (NAS Peru), and only three months later on 1 March 1943, the name changed again, this time to Naval Air <b>Station</b> <b>Bunker</b> Hill (NAS Bunker Hill), which it kept {{for the rest of}} the war.|$|R
50|$|Bold A and B Power Stations were coal fired, with {{a direct}} coal {{conveyor}} belt link from a washery at the colliery. This fed either directly to coal <b>bunkers</b> in both <b>stations</b> or to a stocking area. The extensive rail sidings were utilised for coal delivery, either from Bold Colliery or from other collieries via the main Liverpool to Manchester Lines. The coal from Bold Colliery was deep mined and therefore costly to recover. In later years, due to commercial reasons, the main coal supply became mostly by road from either Yorkshire or Scotland.|$|R
50|$|During World War II this bunker {{village was}} built {{as the main}} command for the Atlantic Wall in Belgium. The command ran from the French border to Walcheren.

Not only von und zu Gilsa, but also General der Panzertruppen Alfred Ritter von Hubicki and even Generalfeldmarschall Rommel spent visiting the Bunkers. Both Generals von Hubicki and von und zu Gilsa probably stayed in one of the houses around the park.|$|R
50|$|The Memorial, {{constructed}} in 1965, {{became known as}} one of the most important buildings in the history of Israeli architecture. The Memorial building also served as a cultural center. The building, built in the brutalist style, is reminiscent of a <b>bunker</b> or military <b>station</b> and overlooks the original site of the Kibbutz. The building, with its different components, tries to evoke in the visitors the feelings of the combat soldier in war over his home, as well as a sense of loss for those who fell. Alongside the building, Zolotov invited the sculptor Moshe Sternschuss to construct a monument for the fallen.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1929 and 1936 the {{appearance}} of the station changed dramatically and most of the original wooden 1917/1918 hangars, barrack blocks and offices were demolished and replaced with substantial brick structures.
