50|$|To {{achieve a}} more {{efficient}} use of bandwidth for <b>bursty</b> <b>traffic,</b> ALOHAnet developed the random-access packet switching method {{that has come to}} be known as a pure ALOHA channel. This approach effectively dynamically allocates bandwidth immediately to a user who has data to send, using the acknowledgment/retransmission mechanism described earlier to deal with occasional access collisions. While the average channel loading must be kept below about 10% to maintain a low collision rate, this still results in better bandwidth efficiency than when fixed allocations are used in a <b>bursty</b> <b>traffic</b> context.|$|E
5000|$|This causes {{problems}} when used on TCP/IP routers handling multiple TCP streams, especially when <b>bursty</b> <b>traffic</b> is present. While {{the network is}} stable, the queue is constantly full, {{and there are no}} problems except that the full queue results in high latency. However, the introduction of a sudden burst of traffic may cause large numbers of established, steady streams to lose packets simultaneously.|$|E
40|$|Using real traffic data, we {{show that}} neural network-based {{prediction}} techniques {{can be used to}} predict the queuing behaviour of highly <b>bursty</b> <b>traffics</b> typical of LAN interconnection in a way accurate enough so as to allow dynamical renegotiation of a DBR traffic contract at the edge of an ATM network...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a sender-side-only {{filtering}} method to improve the accuracy of buffer estimation. Buffer estimates are of interest in many applications, e. g. enhancing the performance and behavior of TCP, as well as improving the user experience of UDP applications. A conventional approach to estimate the buffer size of the bottleneck link is to estimate the packet round trip time (RTT) values that include the maximum and minimum queuing delays. By calculating the difference of these two values, one can then estimate the buffer size. However, such approach is shown to be problematic {{in the presence of}} lossy links, <b>bursty</b> cross <b>traffic,</b> and multiple bottleneck links. This paper introduces a new technique called Dispersion Delta Filtering (DDF) which takes not only the RTT range but also packet dispersion into consideration. The dispersion data is used to filter out RTT samples affected by <b>bursty</b> cross <b>traffic.</b> By filtering these nonrepresentative RTT samples, the proposed method is able to estimate the buffer more accurately under <b>bursty</b> cross <b>traffic</b> scenarios. We augment TCPW-BBE (TCP Westwood with Buffer and Bandwidth Estimation) to evaluate the accuracy of a buffer estimate with and without the proposed filtering algorithm. Simulation results show that by incorporating the proposed filtering technique, TCPW-BBE obtains a more accurate buffer estimate regardless of the rates of <b>bursty</b> cross <b>traffic,</b> the direction of <b>bursty</b> cross <b>traffic,</b> as well as the number of coexisting flows. The overall TCPW-BBE throughput is improved while greatly increasing friendliness with TCP-NewReno...|$|R
50|$|This {{problem has}} been the subject of much research. The {{consensus}} appears to be that the tail drop algorithm is the leading cause of the problem, and other queue size management algorithms such as Random Early Detection (RED) and Weighted RED will reduce the likelihood of global synchronization, as well as keeping queue sizes down in the face of heavy load and <b>bursty</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
50|$|RED is {{more fair}} than tail drop, {{in the sense}} that it does not possess a bias against <b>bursty</b> <b>traffic</b> that uses only a small portion of the bandwidth. The more a host transmits, the more likely it is that its packets are dropped as the {{probability}} of a host's packet being dropped is proportional to the amount of data it has in a queue. Early detection helps avoid TCP global synchronization.|$|E
50|$|The {{token bucket}} {{can be used}} in either traffic shaping or traffic policing. In traffic policing, nonconforming packets may be {{discarded}} (dropped) or may be reduced in priority (for downstream traffic management functions to drop if there is congestion). In traffic shaping, packets are delayed until they conform. Traffic policing and traffic shaping are commonly used to protect the network against excess or excessively <b>bursty</b> <b>traffic,</b> see bandwidth management and congestion avoidance. Traffic shaping is commonly used in the network interfaces in hosts to prevent transmissions being discarded by traffic management functions in the network.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{a number of}} IP packet level very-high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) traffic traces {{collected}} by the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) National Laboratory for Applied Network Research (NLANR) measurement and analysis group passive monitors {{at a number of}} highperformance connection (HPC) sites. Specifically, we show that the vBNS traffic traces also [...] . have long-range-dependence properties, which have been observed in LAN, WAN, WWW, and VBR video traffic traces. We also discuss how to model vBNS traffic using multiplicative multifractal processes. It is observed that very <b>bursty</b> vBNS <b>traffic</b> traces can be readily modeled by ideal multiplicative multifractal models, while not so <b>bursty</b> vBNS <b>traffic</b> traces cannot. This is because the burstiness levels for such traffic traces at different time scales are very different. A stage-dependent multiplicative process model is then developed for the not very <b>bursty</b> vBNS <b>traffic...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Available Bit Rate (ABR) {{service has}} been shown to enable persistent, greedy data sources to {{efficiently}} utilize ATM network resources. However, the throughput for bursty TCP over ABR data traffic in the presence of interfering traffic may not be as good as for persistent ABR sources without interfering traffic.

50|$|In other words, {{asynchronous}} CDMA is {{ideally suited}} to a mobile network where large numbers of transmitters each generate a relatively small amount of traffic at irregular intervals. CDM (synchronous CDMA), TDMA, and FDMA systems cannot recover the underutilized resources inherent to <b>bursty</b> <b>traffic</b> due to the fixed number of orthogonal codes, time slots or frequency channels that can be assigned to individual transmitters. For instance, if there are N time slots in a TDMA system and 2N users that talk half of the time, then half of the time {{there will be more}} than N users needing to use more than N time slots. Furthermore, it would require significant overhead to continually allocate and deallocate the orthogonal-code, time-slot or frequency-channel resources. By comparison, asynchronous CDMA transmitters simply send when they have something to say and go off the air when they don't, keeping the same PN signature sequence {{as long as they are}} connected to the system.|$|E
50|$|The leaky bucket as a meter {{can be used}} {{in either}} traffic shaping or traffic policing. For example, in ATM networks, {{in the form of the}} Generic Cell Rate Algorithm, it is used to compare the {{bandwidth}} and burstiness of traffic on a Virtual Channel (VC) or Virtual Path (VP) against the specified limits on the rate at which cells may arrive and the maximum jitter, or variation in inter-arrival intervals, for the VC or VP. In traffic policing, cells that do not conform to these limits (nonconforming cells) may be discarded (dropped) or may be reduced in priority (for downstream traffic management functions to drop if there is congestion). In traffic shaping, cells are delayed until they conform. Traffic policing and traffic shaping are commonly used in UPC/NPC to protect the network against excess or excessively <b>bursty</b> <b>traffic,</b> see bandwidth management and congestion avoidance. Traffic shaping is commonly used in the network interfaces in hosts to prevent transmissions exceeding the bandwidth or jitter limits and being discarded by traffic management functions in the network, see network scheduling and network scheduler.|$|E
50|$|Asynchronous CDMA {{offers a}} key {{advantage}} in the flexible allocation of resources i.e. allocation of a PN codes to active users. In the case of CDM (synchronous CDMA), TDMA, and FDMA the number of simultaneous orthogonal codes, time slots and frequency slots respectively are fixed, hence the capacity in terms of number of simultaneous users is limited. There are a fixed number of orthogonal codes, time slots or frequency bands that can be allocated for CDM, TDMA, and FDMA systems, which remain underutilized due to the bursty nature of telephony and packetized data transmissions. There is no strict limit {{to the number of}} users that can be supported in an asynchronous CDMA system, only a practical limit governed by the desired bit error probability, since the SIR (signal-to-interference ratio) varies inversely with the number of users. In a <b>bursty</b> <b>traffic</b> environment like mobile telephony, the advantage afforded by asynchronous CDMA is that the performance (bit error rate) is allowed to fluctuate randomly, with an average value determined by the number of users times the percentage of utilization. Suppose there are 2N users that only talk half of the time, then 2N users can be accommodated with the same average bit error probability as N users that talk all of the time. The key difference here is that the bit error probability for N users talking all of the time is constant, whereas it is a random quantity (with the same mean) for 2N users talking half of the time.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the effect on}} TCP of {{assigning}} higher-priority to traffic requesting Expedited Forwarding (EF) service in a Differentiated Services network. We analyze networks in which (1) EF traffic occupies different fractions of link bandwidth and is bursty at different time-scales; and (2) multiple TCP flows with heterogeneous round trip times share the network with the EF traffic. We find {{that even in the}} presence of <b>bursty</b> EF <b>traffic,</b> statistical multiplexing gains allow TCP to utilize most of the available bandwidth. Further, the presence of <b>bursty</b> EF <b>traffic</b> improves the fairness of bandwidth allocation among TCP flows; smaller more frequent bursts yield larger improvements in TCP fairness. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction This {{white paper}} {{addresses}} {{the behavior of}} Raman amplifiers when subject to <b>bursty</b> <b>traffic.</b> <b>Bursty</b> <b>traffic</b> is defined as traffic where the string of zeros can last from nanoseconds to seconds. Such <b>bursty</b> <b>traffic</b> might arise if sensors or satellite down-links input are placed directly on glass fibers. In a normal telecommunications scenario, the traffic is more-or-less smooth due {{to the use of}} synchronous optical network (SONET) framing, which uses coding to restrict the number of adjacent bits that can be zeros. However, for future government networks or high-end educational networks the expense and complexity of the SONET multiplexers may be removed. In the future, even commercial networks may want to run packet traffic such as IP directly on glass as well, again thereby avoiding the expense of SONET multiplexers.

30|$|While {{dimensioning}} small cells backhauls, it {{is important}} to consider that small cell BSs may have a higher peak and busy hour throughput than macrocell BSs, which emphasises the need for high capacity backhaul links to meet the expected small cell QoS requirements at busy time periods. Small cell BS may also generate in average less but <b>burstier</b> <b>traffic</b> than macrocell BSs, due to its lower number of connected UEs, and thus, traffic aggregation may be essential to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of small cell backhaul. Aggregating backhaul traffic through a linear backhaul topology may be the easiest solution to realise. However, this topology may result in single points of failure, which encourages operators to consider more resilient but expensive backhaul topologies, e.g., star and mesh.|$|R

In addition, in order to utilize the scarce wireless resource efficiently, as many users as possible should be admitted into the network while providing guaranteed quality-of-service support for them. In this work, a call admission control scheme, Differentiated Outage Probabilities CAC or DOP-CAC, is proposed to achieve the above goals for imperfectly power controlled multimedia CDMA networks.
