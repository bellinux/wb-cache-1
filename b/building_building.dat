5|$|The {{plant was}} laid out roughly north to south {{orientation}} along the Thames River. The plant itself {{is a mixture of}} interconnected buildings and stand-alone structures. The stand-alone structures included three propane sheds (Buildings 63, 64 and 65) that were located near the Human Resources <b>building</b> (<b>Building</b> 86) and its storage shed (Building 30). The main structure of the plant was a string of connecting buildings that were erected and integrated into the production and operation of the plant. At {{the north end of the}} plant was the Research and Development <b>building</b> (<b>Building</b> 87), it was located connected to two large storage buildings (Building 1 and 2). On the front of Building 2 was the main offices (Building 85). Building 2 is connected to the largest building, the Manufacturing <b>Building</b> (<b>Building</b> 3), which is connected to the Manufacturing Glass House (Building 5) and Glass House 2 (Building 32). Building 32 also served as storage building. Connected to Building 5 is the Glass House Cullet & Mix House (Number 7) and the Compressor & Auxiliary Generator building (Number 9) at the southern end.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before and}} after World War I, the Lilly company {{experienced}} rapid change. Expansion of Lilly's manufacturing facilities at the McCarty Street plant improved production capacity with a new Science <b>Building</b> (<b>Building</b> 14), opened in 1911, and a new capsule plant (Building 15) in 1913. The company also began constructions of the Lilly Biological Laboratories, a research and manufacturing plant on 150 acres near Greenfield, Indiana, in 1913.|$|E
25|$|By {{the start}} of the 1965-1966 school year, Revelle College had grown to loosely {{resemble}} the modern campus, surrounding a central plaza. The completion of the sixth academic <b>building,</b> <b>Building</b> F (now York Hall), marked the end of its growth {{and the beginning of the}} establishment of John Muir College. In addition to a library in Building E (Galbraith Hall), the college was equipped to house 440 undergraduates in the newly constructed Fleet residence halls. An 800-seat cafeteria, the Plaza Cafe, was constructed to replace the canteen in the basement of Building C (Mayer Hall). Blake and Argo Halls were added in 1968.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{grew at a}} {{rapid rate}} throughout the 1960s, with three colleges and many other buildings on campus being completed {{by the end of}} the decade. The 1970s saw further construction, but the university also encountered the biggest physical problem in its history. The university had been built above a tunnel on the disused Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. In July 1974 the tunnel collapsed, damaging part of the Cornwallis Building, which sank nearly a metre within about an hour on the evening of 11 July. Fortunately, the university had insurance against subsidence, so it was able to pay for the south-west corner of the building to be demolished and replaced by a new wing at the other end of the <b>building.</b> <b>Building</b> elsewhere included the Park Wood accommodation village and the Darwin houses in 1989.|$|E

25|$|In 1984 the Bell System {{broke up}} into the various Baby Bell {{operating}} companies and AT. As {{a result of this}} divestiture in 1984, the Western Electric plant became an AT Technology Systems (AT Technology Systems) location as part of AT, supplying devices for use in the former Bell System's network. By 1984, employment had reached what would be an all-time high of 4,900. In 1988, microchip and fiber-optic component manufacturing was combined into an AT organization called AT Microelectronics. In 1989 the AT work force nationwide was 297,000 and while employment at the Reading Works was 3,200. In 1992 the Reading Works of AT Microelectronics had 3,300 workers and provided an annual payroll of $100 million. The product mix included lightwave components, linear bipolar integrated circuits, high voltage integrated circuits, high speed silicon integrated circuits, and gallium arsenide integrated circuits. A satellite manufacturing <b>building,</b> <b>Building</b> 10, was constructed on North 13th Street, just north of the General Mail Facility, in 1992. The same year the Falconer building across the street was also used. AT Reading Works was the No. 2 employer in Berks County in 1993, but that was soon to end. In February 1994, AT Reading Works announced that it would be cutting 850 jobs over a 3-year period. In 1994 the Reading Works' work force was reduced from 2,929 to 2,700 with most of the cuts in the Lightwave unit. The Lightwave unit makes fiber-optic laser transmitters and receivers. In 1995 the Reading Works' work force stood at 2,400 including AT Microelectronics and Bell Labs as it prepared for the spin off from AT into Lucent Technologies.|$|E
