5|$|Winemakers {{can also}} control the {{influence}} of oak by using alternatives to the standard barrique barrels. Larger barrels have a smaller wood-to-wine ratio and therefore less pronounced oak flavors. Winemakers in Italy and Portugal sometimes use barrels made from other wood types such as chestnut and redwood. Another method that winemakers consider is tea <b>bagging</b> with oak chips or adding oak planks to the wines while fermenting or aging it in stainless steel tanks. While these methods are less costly than oak barrels, they create more pronounced oak flavors, which tend not to mellow or integrate {{with the rest of}} the wine's components; nor do they provide the gradual oxidation benefit of barrel aging.|$|E

25|$|Oysters {{have been}} cultured {{for well over}} a century. The Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas) is {{presently}} the most widely grown bivalve around the world. Two methods are commonly used, release and <b>bagging.</b> In both cases, oysters are cultivated onshore to the size of spat, when they can attach themselves to a substrate. They may be allowed to mature further to form 'seed oysters'. In either case, they are then placed in the water to mature. The release technique involves distributing the spat throughout existing oyster beds, allowing them to mature naturally to be collected like wild oysters. <b>Bagging</b> has the cultivator putting spat in racks or bags and keeping them above the bottom. Harvesting involves simply lifting the bags or rack to the surface and removing the mature oysters. The latter method prevents losses to some predators, but is more expensive.|$|E
