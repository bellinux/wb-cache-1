50|$|In metalworking, a dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammer</b> {{can be used}} to {{properly}} seat the workpiece against parallels in a machine vise.|$|E
5000|$|Dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammer</b> {{delivers}} {{impact with}} very little recoil, often due to a hollow head filled with sand, lead shot or pellets ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{head of a}} dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammer</b> is {{commonly}} hollow and partially filled with loose sand, lead shot, or steel shot, which distribute {{the energy of the}} strike {{over a longer period of}} time. If a filled hammer head breaks while in use, it is likely to scatter a spray of the loose filler particles in the vicinity. Therefore, use of a traditional dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammer</b> may be restricted in certain settings, such as a manufacturing clean room, where contamination by foreign material could occur.|$|E
5000|$|The {{heads of}} some dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammers</b> {{are filled with}} shot to {{minimize}} rebound off the struck surface.|$|R
50|$|Dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammers</b> {{are used}} in {{woodworking}} to knock joints together or apart without denting the wood pieces being worked on.|$|R
50|$|Dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammers</b> are {{sometimes}} used in orthopedic surgical procedures. The tools {{are also used}} in telecommunications to form large diameter cables within cable runs.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{conventional}} solid-head hammer, {{the force of}} the entire solid mass of the head is delivered at the moment of impact. Compared to {{a conventional}} hammer of similar weight, a dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammer</b> conveys less peak force, spread over a longer time interval.|$|E
50|$|A dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammer</b> is a {{specialized}} mallet helpful in minimizing {{damage to the}} struck surface and in limiting peak striking force, with minimal elastic rebound from the struck surface. The minimal rebound is helpful in avoiding accidental damage to precision work, especially in tight locations and in applications such as maintenance work on hydraulic cylinders.|$|E
50|$|Masonry bits {{typically}} are {{used with a}} hammer drill, which hammers the bit into the material being drilled as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the masonry at the drill bit tip, and the rotating flutes carry away the dust. Rotating the bit also brings the cutting edges onto a fresh portion of the hole bottom with every hammer <b>blow.</b> <b>Hammer</b> drill bits often use special shank shapes such as the SDS type, which allows the bit to slide within the chuck when hammering, without the whole heavy chuck executing the hammering motion.|$|E
50|$|In {{maintenance}} of hydraulic machinery and aerospace work, dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammers</b> {{are useful in}} freeing stuck cylinders without damaging their precision-formed surfaces or any nearby bearings.|$|R
50|$|Some dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammers</b> have {{completely}} solid heads, usually made of rubber or resilient plastic (such as ultra {{high molecular weight}} plastic, UHMW), and rely on the inherent properties of the material to absorb shock and reduce rebound. Commonly constructed of polyurethane, dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammers</b> regularly appear in solid orange or black. Composite heads and fiberglass handle models are also available, with optional shock-absorbent rubber grips. A variant design omits the handle entirely; the dead blow head is gripped directly in the hand, for use in tight locations.|$|R
50|$|In auto repair, dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammers</b> are {{commonly}} used for chassis work, dislodging stuck parts and sometimes used for hubcap installation and removal (e.g. knock-off hubs). They {{can be used to}} pop out small dents when doing auto body repair. They allow controlled use of impact force when performing engine or transmission repair.|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} {{question is}} {{on whether to}} restore the third <b>hammer</b> <b>blow.</b> Both the Ratz edition {{and the most recent}} critical edition delete the third <b>hammer</b> <b>blow.</b> However, advocates {{on opposite sides of the}} inner movement debate, such as Del Mar and Matthews, have separately argued for restoration of the third <b>hammer</b> <b>blow.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gravity exerts a {{force on}} the hammer head. If {{hammering}} downwards, gravity increases the acceleration during the hammer stroke and increases the energy delivered with each <b>blow.</b> If <b>hammering</b> upwards, gravity reduces the acceleration during the hammer stroke and therefore reduces the energy delivered with each <b>blow.</b> Some <b>hammering</b> methods, such as traditional mechanical pile drivers, rely entirely on gravity for acceleration on the down stroke.|$|R
50|$|Some dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammers</b> have {{replaceable}} striking faces, attached by screwing or pressing {{them into}} {{place on the}} main body of the hammer. These replaceable inserts allow selection of the appropriate hardness for the striking face to reduce damage to an object being hammered, while optimizing the energy transfer of impact. Also, worn or damaged inserts can be replaced without discarding the entire handtool.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanically {{generated}} impact sparks. For example, a <b>hammer</b> <b>blow</b> on a rusty steel surface {{compared to}} a <b>hammer</b> <b>blow</b> on a flint stone. The speed and impact angle (between surface and hammer) are important; a 90 degree blow on a surface is relatively harmless.|$|R
50|$|The {{movement}} is punctuated by three <b>hammer</b> <b>blows.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Masonry bits {{typically}} are {{used with a}} hammer drill, which hammers the bit into the material being drilled as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the masonry at the drill bit tip, and the rotating flutes carry away the dust. Rotating the bit also brings the cutting edges onto a fresh portion of the hole bottom with every <b>hammer</b> <b>blow.</b> [...] <b>Hammer</b> drill bits often use special shank shapes such as the SDS type, which allows the bit to slide within the chuck when hammering, without the whole heavy chuck executing the hammering motion.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{work surface}} of the anvil {{is known as the}} face. It is {{generally}} made of hardened steel and should be flat and smooth with rounded edges for most work. Any marks on the face will be transferred to the work. Also, sharp edges tend to cut into the metal being worked and may cause cracks to form in the workpiece. The face is hardened and tempered to resist the blows of the smith's hammer, so the anvil face does not deform under repeated use. A hard anvil face also reduces the amount of force lost in each <b>hammer</b> <b>blow.</b> <b>Hammers,</b> tools, and work pieces of hardened steel should never directly strike the anvil face with full force, as they may damage it; this can result in chipping or deforming of the anvil face.|$|R

5000|$|Ultra {{light-weight}} motion (rods, pistons and piston valves) {{to minimize}} inertia forces and thus balancing requirements (and thus <b>hammer</b> <b>blow</b> on the track).|$|R
5000|$|The {{amount of}} energy {{delivered}} to the target by the hammer-blow is equivalent to one half {{the mass of the}} head times the square of the head's speed at the time of impact (...) [...] While the energy delivered to the target increases linearly with mass, it increases quadratically with the speed (see the effect of the handle, below). High tech titanium heads are lighter and allow for longer handles, thus increasing velocity and delivering the same energy with less arm fatigue than that of a heavier steel head hammer. A titanium head has about 3% recoil energy and can result in greater efficiency and less fatigue when compared to a steel head with up to 30% recoil. Dead <b>blow</b> <b>hammers</b> use special rubber or steel shot to absorb recoil energy, rather than bouncing the hammer head after impact.|$|R

50|$|The {{addition}} of extra weights on the wheels reduces the unbalanced reciprocating {{forces on the}} locomotive but causes it {{to be out of}} balance vertically creating <b>hammer</b> <b>blow.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{proportion}} of the reciprocating weight is balanced {{with the addition of}} an extra revolving weight in the wheel, i.e. still only balanced statically. The overbalance causes what is known as <b>hammer</b> <b>blow</b> or dynamic augment, both terms having the same definition as given in the following references. <b>Hammer</b> <b>blow</b> varies about the static mean, alternately adding to and subtracting from it with each wheel revolution.In the United States it is known as dynamic augment, a vertical force caused by a designer's attempt to balance reciprocating parts by incorporating counterbalance in wheels.|$|R
50|$|Steam turbine {{locomotives}} lack pistons, {{valve gear}} and other fore-aft reciprocating components {{making it possible}} to balance the wheels and connecting rods to eliminate <b>hammer</b> <b>blow.</b> Steam turbine locomotives were tried by several companies around the world in the 1930s and 1940s (such as the Pennsylvania Railroad's S2 6-8-6 and the LMS' Turbomotive). Whilst many of these turbine locos suffered problems in service (usually excessive fuel consumption and/or poor reliability) they did prove to be free from <b>hammer</b> <b>blow</b> and offered a way of achieving high power outputs and speeds without causing track damage.|$|R
