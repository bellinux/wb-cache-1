And, with apologies to Saint Paul, the greatest of these is preservation. For without preservation neither of the first two ultimately matter. My assignment this morning is to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> on one specific aspect of the preservation function, library repositories, and indeed, library repository developments in the US. The plan for this morning's presentation is the following: after a brief background review to give us a context for American developments we will examine first the various kinds of print repositories and then the various initiatives for electronic repositories.

40|$|For all {{practical}} purposes, {{research in this}} country {{on the problem of}} bird hazards to aircraft began in 1960 with the crash of an Electra turboprop that carried 62 people to their deaths and was attributed to ingestion of starlings into the engines. In this paper I intend to review the problem and present some of the answers found by investigators in this country and, to lesser extent, abroad. The discussion will be roughly divided into two parts: 1) what: causes the problem, when, and where; and 2) what has been and is being done at airfields to reduce it. Dr. Seubert of the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center described the problem in Europe at this conference 3 years ago, so I will try to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> on the problem here.

Since then we have attempted primarily to solve crop depredation, feed lot, and roost problems with the idea that knowledge obtained from them could be adapted and applied to bird hazard problems as they arose at airfields...|$|E
40|$|Greetings from Ann Arbor, where {{philosophy}} is thriving! I {{hope you have}} had a restful summer. The academic year 2004 - 2005 was among the most eventful in the Philosophy Department’s recent history, and I would like to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> on some of the more noteworthy developments. Faculty News: This has been a year of accomplishment and a year of change for our faculty. Let’s begin with the accomplishments. Michigan remains among the strongest Philosophy Departments anywhere, and the intellectual world recognizes it. Larry Sklar has been elected president of the Philosophy of Science Association (he assumes the position in 2006). Though only a handful of the best philosophers of science ever get to hold this prestigious office, Larry’s election came as no surprise {{to those of us who}} know how critical his work has been in setting the agenda for the philosophy of physics in our day. Peter Railton, whose many seminal contributions to moral philosophy, the philosophy of science and epistemology make him one of the most versatile thinkers around, was one of only four philosophers elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences this past year. He is the sixth member of the Department to receive this exceptionally rare and high honor. Allan Gibbard was elected to the American Philosophical Society. Founded by Ben Franklin in 1743, this was the Nation’s first learned society, and it remains among its most prestigious. Despite its name, the APS has traditionally been very stingy when it comes to admitting philosophers: only sixteen have been elected to its ranks since 1975, and all are household names (in philosophers ’ households, anyhow). This well-deserved honor indicates the hig...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, many {{angiogenesis}} inhibitors {{have been developed}} for clinical use in oncology. Surgeons, radiotherapists as well as medical oncologists have been investigating with much effort and enthusiasm the translation of these agents from the preclinical setting into treatment strategies of patients. Recently, {{for the first time in}} history, the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab (avastin), a humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, showed a survival benefit of 4. 7 months in a phase III clinical trial in patients with advanced colorectal cancer when this agent was given in combination with chemotherapy. At the annual meeting of the American Association of Clinical Oncology 2005, similar results of bevacizumab in lung, breast and ovarian cancer clinical trials have been shown. These landmark studies proofed for the first time in the clinical setting that Dr. Folkman back in 1971 was right by proposing: "in order to stop tumor growth, one should attack its blood supply". Nowadays it seems trivial to propose such a hypothesis, at that time it was a very provocative hypothesis and it took more than 30 years to proof this hypothesis in the Clinic. Although one may be excited about this major finding, there is no time to relax. The survival benefit of bevacizumab is only about 4 months. Therefore more potent antiangiogenic agents and more active treatment strategies are urgently warranted. Newer angiogenesis inhibitors that a recurrently in preclinical or early clinical development have shown in preclinical experiments improved antitumor activities. In addition, combinations of biological agents that interdere in multiple biological pathways in cancer growth including chemotherapy, are of major clinical interest as well. The multimodality approach in which surgeons, radiotherapists and medical oncologists collaborate needs to be explored as well. In a variety of cancer types, like breast colon and lung cancer, these specialists should design multimodality strategies based on current standard treatment in which they incorporate angiogenesis inhibitors in the right time frame of surgery and radiotherapy. In this review we will <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> on the clinical development of angiogenesis inhibitors and we will summarize the multimodality strategies that are under development...|$|E
