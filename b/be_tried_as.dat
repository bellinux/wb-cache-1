5|$|De Iniusta {{states that}} St-Calais was {{brought before the}} king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, the king having confiscated the bishop's lands before the trial. At the trial St-Calais held that as a bishop {{he could not be}} tried in a secular court, and he refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> a vassal, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then appealed to Rome, but his request was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or the lands he held as a bishop, was forfeit.|$|E

5|$|Maximus' {{refusal to}} accept Monothelitism {{caused him to}} be brought to the {{imperial}} capital of Constantinople to <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> a heretic in 658. In Constantinople, Monothelitism had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position and was sent back into exile for four more years. During his trial he was accused of aiding the Muslim conquests in Egypt and North Africa, which he rejected as slander.|$|E

5|$|St-Calais {{was brought}} before the king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, before which the king seized his lands. At the trial, St-Calais held that as a bishop {{he could not be}} tried in a secular court, and refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> a vassal, not as a bishop.

St-Calais then asked for an appeal to Rome, which was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or lands, was forfeit. Although St-Calais claimed to be defending the rights of clergy to be tried in clerical courts and to appeal to Rome, his fellow bishops believed otherwise. Lending support to their belief is the fact that St-Calais never pursued his appeal to Rome, and that later, in 1095, he took the side of the king against Anselm of Canterbury when Anselm tried to assert a right to appeal to Rome.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{testified in}} court {{she also said}} she conversed with Lord Voldemort {{and one of the}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her {{prosecution}} was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that she knew what she was doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E
5|$|Fearing Castro was a socialist, the U.S. {{instructed}} Cantillo to oust Batista. Cantillo secretly {{agreed to}} a ceasefire with Castro, promising that Batista would <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> a war criminal; however, Batista was warned, and fled into exile with over US$300,000,000 on December 31, 1958. Cantillo entered Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra to be President, and began appointing the new government. Furious, Castro ended the ceasefire, and ordered Cantillo's arrest by sympathetic figures in the army. Accompanying celebrations at news of Batista's downfall on January 1, 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to prevent widespread looting and vandalism. Cienfuegos and Guevara led their columns into Havana on January 2, while Castro entered Santiago and gave a speech invoking the wars of independence. Heading toward Havana, he greeted cheering crowds at every town, giving press conferences and interviews.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the American Civil War, the Wirgman Building was {{frequently}} {{used as a}} military prison by both Confederate States Army and Union Army forces during their occupations of Romney. In the Spring of 1862, a spy for the command of Stonewall Jackson, Lieutenant John Blue, was captured by Union Army soldiers while he was conducting a reconnaissance mission to determine the size and strength of the Union Army forces occupying Romney. Pending his transfer to a military prison in Wheeling where he was to <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> a suspected spy, Blue was imprisoned in a room {{on the second floor}} of the Wirgman Building. During the early morning on Easter Day, Blue disabled the only guard on duty, disguised himself in a Union Army coat and headgear and proceeded to barricade the remainder of the prison garrison within the Wirgman Building. Blue walked to the periphery of the town of Romney unnoticed by the occupying Union Army forces, and successfully made it to safety.|$|E
5|$|Paine left England {{before he}} could <b>be</b> <b>tried,</b> <b>as</b> he had been elected {{a member of the}} National Convention in France, tasked with writing a new constitution. He {{departed}} England on 13 September, never to return, although he further infuriated the government remotely by republishing the Rights of Man and writing Letter Addressed to the Addressors of the Late Proclamation, in which he defended his actions and beliefs against those who had chosen to side with the government. Paine was instead represented in absentia by Thomas Erskine, a famous lawyer and orator who served as Attorney General to the Prince of Wales. As the trial date approached, both Erskine and Paine were targeted by vicious personal attacks. Paine's writ was followed by hundreds of loyal addresses, many of which targeted him, the burning of an effigy in Exeter, and the banning of the sale of any of his books in Chester. Pamphlets slandering him were widely published, and both Paine and Erskine had their personal lives dug into.|$|E
5|$|The {{jury found}} Bell guilty, and {{he faced the}} {{possibility}} of up to 22years in prison. The judge scheduled sentencing for September 20, 2007. Bell's new defense attorneys, Bob Noel, Walter Lee Perkins Jr., Peggy Sullivan, Louis Scott and Carol Powell-Lexing, requested a new trial {{on the grounds that}} Bell should not have been tried as an adult. A request to lower Bell's $90,000bond was denied on August 24, 2007, due to his juvenile record. Bell had been put on probation for a battery that occurred December 25, 2005. While on probation, he was convicted of another battery charge and two charges of criminal damage to property. One of the battery charges was reportedly for punching a 17-year-old girl in the face. The media had initially reported that Bell had no prior criminal record. On September 4, 2007, Judge Mauffray vacated the conspiracy conviction on the grounds that Bell should have been tried as a juvenile, but he let the battery conviction stand. Bell appealed his conviction, principally on the ground that he had been improperly tried as an adult. On September 14, 2007, Louisiana's Third Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Bell's battery conviction, agreeing that this remaining charge was not among those for which a juvenile may <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> an adult.|$|E

25|$|Surviving pirate Abduwali Muse {{was held}} on Boxer and was {{eventually}} flown to the United States for trial. Prosecutors brought charges in a federal courtroom in New York City that included piracy, conspiracy to seize a ship by force, and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking. Muse's lawyers asked that he <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> a juvenile, alleging that he was either 15 or 16 {{years old at the}} time of the hostage-taking, but the court ruled that Muse was not a juvenile and would <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> an adult. He later admitted that he was 18 years old and pleaded guilty to hijacking, kidnapping, and hostage-taking charges in lieu of piracy charges. He received a prison sentence of 33 years and nine months.|$|E

Others said that doing so would be illegal, including prominent American legal scholar and lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and would jeopardize the prosecution. The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant.|$|E

25|$|The PCL-R, the PCL:SV, and the PCL:YV {{are highly}} {{regarded}} and {{widely used in}} criminal justice settings, particularly in North America.

There have been several criticisms against its use in legal settings. They include the general criticisms against the PCL-R, the availability of other risk assessment tools which may have advantages, and the excessive pessimism surrounding the prognosis and treatment possibilities of those who are diagnosed with psychopathy.|$|E
25|$|Consensual (between minors) sexual {{intercourse}} over the 2-year age difference (where the minor is under 13 years old) would subject the older minor to {{a charge of}} Sexual Assault, 1st Degree, in violation of C.G.S. §53a-70(a)(2). A guilty verdict would result in conviction of a Class A felony sex offense, with a mandatory minimum of 5–10 years and maximum 25 years imprisonment. Any juvenile offender 14 years old or older has the case automatically transferred to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court by operation of law, and thus stands before the court to <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> an adult.

25|$|Consensual sexual {{intercourse}} over the 3-year age difference (where the minor is 13 to 15 years old) would subject the older party to {{a charge of}} Sexual Assault, 2nd Degree, in violation of C.G.S. §53a-71(a)(1). Any juvenile offender 14 years old or older has the case automatically transferred to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court by operation of law, and thus stands before the court to <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> an adult. See C.G.S. §46b-127(a). A guilty verdict would result in conviction of a Class B felony sex offense, with a mandatory minimum of 9 months and maximum 20 years imprisonment. It would not matter if the older person {{did not know of}} the age difference, or if the younger person lied about age. However, if the offender is 17 years old or younger, has a clean record, and such sexual activity was consensual, Youthful Offender status (a pre-trial diversionary program that seals the court record and results in a dismissal of charges) may be granted. See C.G.S. §54-76b to o.|$|E
