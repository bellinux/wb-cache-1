40|$|When the European Commission {{launched}} its public consultation on gender imbalance on corporate boards, the predominant rhetoric was that improving gender balance in corporate leadership {{would be good}} for business and bring economic benefits to help member states recover from the economic crisis of 2008. In this policy brief, leading equality law scholar Professor Julie C.

The policy <b>brief</b> <b>charts</b> the opposition to the proposals among member states, spearheaded by the UK, and outlines the conflict between gender quotas and the equal treatment jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice.

40|$|At last year's NATO {{workshop}} "Massive Military Data Fusion" held in Norway 2002, it {{was agreed}} that there is an increasing need for visualization of data. This need has increased because the military now receives more data coming from more sensors and more sources. In the intelligence context, the fusion of information is a multi-layered process. First, raw data are collected and filtered and brought to archives. The analysis of the data is the most time-consuming process, since it can be automated only in a limited range. Thus, there is still a need for a human-in-the-loop. For humans, the best way to analyze large amounts of data is through their pattern recognition abilities, thus using powerful algorithms of visualization. In this paper, the authors present their approaches to visualization on different levels. First, they describe data modeling in the intelligence context, using the MEDAV archive {{as an example of a}} data model. Then they define various approaches to visualization, and later on show various approaches to visualization for different information retrieval tasks.

He needs to go and get his teeth checked by a dentist at the local public dental clinic.

40|$|Persons {{living with}} chronic pain {{encounter}} {{a host of}} physical and psychosocial problems resulting {{in a loss of}} quality of life and increased disability. The construct of avoidance has been proposed as a mechanism by which these changes in functioning occur. This study explored the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) construct of experiential avoidance and its conceptualization within the ACT model of avoidance, the Cycle of Avoidance. The model is introduced as a framework for integrating an existing model of chronic pain and avoidance, the Schema Enmeshment Model of Pain (SEMP), thus providing a more comprehensive perspective. The study used empirically validated measures to explore constructs integral to the Avoidance Cycle, namely anxiety sensitivity, catastrophizing, experiential avoidance, and their associations with anxiety, depression, quality of life, and disability. The construct of enmeshment, which is a major component of the SEMP, was examined as a conceptualization of the Avoidance Cycle 2 ̆ 7 s stage of Entanglement. The study also examined participant 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of the temporal relationships in the Avoidance Cycle. The ACT and SEMP constructs were examined using multi-method assessment including written questionnaires, <b>brief</b> interview, and <b>chart</b> review. Participants were 139 adults with chronic, nonmalignant pain, recruited from a university pain clinic. Results showed that the components of the Avoidance Cycle of catastrophizing and pain-specific experiential avoidance predicted participants 2 ̆ 7 degree of enmeshment and enmeshment in turn predicted the mental. component of quality of life and disability.
