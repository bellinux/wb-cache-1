50|$|Previous work {{extending}} subway service {{through the}} upper level of the 63rd Street tunnel to lines in Queens also extended the lower level to a point west of Northern Boulevard, across from the Sunnyside Yard. Work in Queens included extending the tunnel under Northern Boulevard, a particularly delicate and expensive task due to the existing elevated BMT Astoria Line, and the IND Queens Boulevard Line subway lines directly above, boring four tunnels under Sunnyside yard and connecting three {{of them to the}} busy Harold Interlocking. (The fourth tunnel will connect to a storage and maintenance area.) In addition, the existing tunnel <b>bell</b> <b>mouth</b> west of Northern Boulevard was expanded to serve as the staging area for the Manhattan work, bringing in workers, equipment and supplies and bringing out the muck and debris from excavation. A temporary narrow-gauge railway and a conveyor belt system were constructed behind the tunnel boring machines and through the 63rd Street tunnels to the Queens <b>bell</b> <b>mouth.</b> Due to its shape, the Queens work site was nicknamed the Q-tip.|$|E
50|$|With {{consideration}} for the harsh western climate a detailed and technical ventilation system was constructed in the Roma Courthouse. Conventional cast iron wall ventilators were combined with Tobin's Tubes to carry cool air from beneath the building into the court room. Boyles roof ventilation using an air pump ventilator, connected by an iron shaft to a <b>bell</b> <b>mouth</b> over a ceiling ventilator, extracted the hot air from the building. Fireplaces were incorporated to provide heating in the winter.|$|E
50|$|Some {{industrial}} strainers available are simplex basket strainers, duplex basket strainers, and Y strainers. Simple basket strainers {{are used}} to protect valuable or sensitive equipment in systems that {{are meant to be}} shut down temporarily. Some commonly used strainers are <b>bell</b> <b>mouth</b> strainers, foot valve strainers, basket strainers. Most processing industries (mainly pharmaceutical, coatings and liquid food industries) will opt for a self-cleaning strainer instead of a basket strainer or a simplex strainer due to limitations of simple filtration systems. The self-cleaning strainers or filters are more efficient and provide an automatic filtration solution.|$|E
50|$|Plenums are {{the central}} {{distribution}} and collection units for an HVAC system. The return plenum carries {{the air from}} several large return grilles (vents) or <b>bell</b> <b>mouths</b> to a central air handler.

50|$|Scappata ("run"). This is {{the start}} of every doppio. The bells, which are in resting {{position}} (mouth downward) are pulled with ropes tied to the goat. The clapper may be pushed away or pulled to ring the bell when the rotation is not sufficient.

5000|$|The dam's {{design is}} unusual in having two totally {{enclosed}} bellmouth overflows (locally named the [...] "plugholes") {{at the side of}} the wall. These are stone and of 80 ft diameter with outlets of 15 ft diameter. Each discharges via its own valve house at the base of the dam. The overflows originally had walkways around them but they were dismantled many years ago. The <b>bell</b> <b>mouths</b> are often completely out of the water and are only rarely submerged, often after heavy rainfall or flooding.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s William M. White and Lewis Ferry Moody both {{patented}} bell-mouth draft tubes. The salient {{feature of}} Moody's Spreading Draft Tube {{is the center}} cone, which distinguishes it from White's Hydraucone Draft Tube. The term Hydraucone is sometimes erroneously used as a general term for all <b>bell</b> <b>mouth</b> tubes. The pair debated over which device was more efficient, particularly {{in the presence of}} swirl as water leaves the turbine. This debate was superseded by the widespread introduction of the elbow-shaped draft tube which is less efficient but easier to construct, particularly on a large scale.|$|E
5000|$|The {{headstock}} is {{fitted with}} a wooden stay, which, {{in conjunction with a}} slider, limits maximum rotational movement to just over a full circle, and allows the bell to be set or rested mouth uppermost. A large wheel is fitted to the headstock and the rope wraps and unwraps as the bell rotates backwards and forwards. Within the bell is a clapper which strikes the thickest part of the <b>bell</b> <b>mouth</b> called the soundbow. In English ringing a set of bells is known as a [...] "ring of bells" [...] and an example of a ring of eight bells is shown mouth upwards in the rest position in the accompanying picture.|$|E

40|$|Solutions to {{the problem}} of {{structural}} and fluidic vibrations in ventilation systems are urgently required because today's lightweight construction trend increases the risk of system failure which are caused by vibrations. Pressure disturbances are known to occur behind elements such as flaps and baffles and behind components such as sharp-edged bends or <b>bell</b> <b>mouths.</b> These disturbances can impair the systems' stability and serviceability. Their differentiation by propagation rates leads to different approaches to the treatment of vibration problemsSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 2686 (3 / 1 / 23 / 91) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekArbeitsgemeinschaft Industrieller Forschungsvereinigungen e.

5000|$|In English full-circle ringing {{there is}} no counter-balancing, so the bell accelerates rapidly to its maximum {{velocity}} when mouth downwards, and slows down as it rises to mouth upwards. In Veronese full-circle ringing {{there is a large}} amount of counter-balancing, so there is little net gravitation pull and the bell accelerates slowly and rotates gracefully. The small out-of-balance weight makes it much easier than English bells to stop the <b>bells</b> <b>mouth</b> upwards. However, English full-circle ringing is capable of much better control of bell speed, as it is independent of the counter-balance effect. The Bolognese style of bell hanging does not have any counter-balancing.|$|R
5000|$|Bells are {{normally}} left mouth down (for safety.) Before ringing, the bells are swung in increasing arcs until the <b>bell</b> is <b>mouth</b> uppermost. When the ringer desires {{to make a}} stroke, the bell is swung around a full circle, the clapper striking once.|$|R
5000|$|Although tuned bells {{have been}} created and used for musical {{performance}} in many cultures, zhong are unique among all other types of cast bells in several respects.

This special shape gives zhong bells the remarkable ability to produce two different musical tones, depending on where they are struck. The interval between these notes on each bell is either a major or minor third, equivalent to a distance {{of four or five}} notes on a piano.|$|E

50|$|In {{building}} services engineering and HVAC, a <b>bell</b> <b>mouth</b> is a tapered expanding or reducing {{opening in the}} end of a ventilation duct, so named because the taper can resemble that of a bell shape. They are primarily designed and used for return air or extract air purposes within building ventilation systems, more commonly located within ceiling voids or other similar plenum. The bellmouth cross sectional area is normally double that of the duct area, so that the air velocity entering the bellmouth is low (to reduce noise, turbulence and pressure drop), and gradually increases to the normal design velocity of the ductwork. The angle of the bellmouth is normally tapered at about 45° as a balance between keeping the bellmouth short without causing too much turbulence or excessive pressure drop. Bell mouths can be manufactured to suit either circular or rectangular ductwork sections.|$|E

Three {{types of}} <b>bell</b> <b>mouth</b> with the inward bell mouths whose exit diameter {{are larger than}} the impeller inner diameter of multi-blade centrifugal fan used in floor standing air-conditioner are investigated by using the numerical simulation method. Three bell mouths are as follows: The first type of <b>bell</b> <b>mouth</b> is the inward inlet used in the original air-conditioner. The second type is the inward inlet whose axial height {{is larger than the}} first type. The third type is the new mold line inward inlet with smaller slope angle than the first type. Calculation results show that the later two type bell mouths can help to improve air volume flow ratio, reduce the vortex in the back of volute exit and increase the air volume flow rate of 6. 8 % and 4. 2 % respectively. The experimental verification was conducted for the simulation results and the experimental results shows that the air volume rates increase 4. 7 % and 3 % respectively, the level of noise is constant.

A total number of 24 test runs were conducted. Three different discharges and four different angles and two groin conditions (submerged and non-submerged) was considered. All tests were conducted for 8 hours duration in clear water condition. Velocity data have been collected forming grids in both vertical and horizontal direction around {{the vicinity of the}} <b>bell</b> <b>mouth</b> groin.

5000|$|Irish gold {{personal}} ornaments {{began to}} be produced within about 200 years either side of 2000 BC, especially in the thin crescent-shaped disks known as lunulae, which was probably first made in Ireland, where over eighty of the hundred odd known examples were found. A range of thin decorated gold discs, bands and plaques, often with pin-holes, were probably attached to clothing, and objects {{that appear to be}} earrings have also been found. By around 1400-1000 BC, heavier thin torcs and bagles have been found. The Late Bronze Age of 900-600 BC saw the peak of the surviving Irish prehistoric goldsmithing, with superbly worked pieces in simple but very sophisticated designs, notably in a type of dress-fastener that looks like a double-ended trumpet curved round so that the two <b>bell</b> <b>mouths</b> are roughly pointing in the same direction.
