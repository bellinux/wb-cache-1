25|$|There {{have been}} various {{studies on the}} {{connection}} between motivation and games. One particular study was on Taiwanese adolescents and their drive of addiction to games. Two studies <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> were conducted. The first study revealed that addicted players showed higher intrinsic than extrinsic motivation and more intrinsic motivation than the non-addicted players. It can then be said that addicted players, according to the studies findings, are more internally motivated to play games. They enjoy the reward of playing. There are studies that also show that motivation gives these players more {{to look for in}} the future such as long-lasting experience that they may keep later on in life.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the coup}} failed, {{the death of}} the King and heir {{apparent}} was responsible for continuing instability which was ultimately a success for the republicans. The traditional parties were able to impose an acclamation solution, with the establishment of a unity government presided by an independent (Francisco Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral), the ostracising of João Franco's supporters, and the repeal of Francist decrees. In fact, the acclamation policies was a rendition: many of the conspirators were liberated from prison, the assassins (who were killed in the square) were eulogized as martyrs and the criminal investigation was rendered ineffective. These events only encouraged the republicans to attempt another coup d'état 33 months later, led <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people,</b> that would succeed in establishing the Portuguese First Republic. The events that gave rise to the attempted coup on January 28 were the last attempts to reform the constitutional monarchy.|$|E

25|$|Paul's dreams, visualized by Brenna in 1780s, materialized in Saint Michael's Castle – the emperor's {{principal}} Saint Petersburg residence {{intended to}} replace the Winter Palace associated with Catherine's reign. The site chosen for the castle was highly significant to Paul: it housed the wooden Summer Palace of empress Elisabeth, it was Paul's birthplace, but also a place where his dreaded mother was proclaimed empress <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> who killed his father. Paul {{said that he had}} a vision of Archangel Michael who instructed him to erect a church on his birthplace, and indeed the castle designed by Brenna had a prominent church integrated in its western facade. Authorized immediately after Catherine's death, the castle was completed by Brenna in four years and occupied by the royal family shortly before Paul's own death. It had a strong Baroque styling clearly contrary to Catherinian palladianism.|$|E
500|$|An {{anonymous}} author's Gesta Hungarorum ("Deeds of the Hungarians"), {{written before}} 1200, is the earliest extant local chronicle. However, this [...] "most misleading" [...] example [...] "of all the early Hungarian texts" [...] (C. A.

Accordingly, in his narration, the Hungarian invasion is in fact a second conquest of the same territory <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
500|$|Along with Weinstein, Oakley was {{to serve}} as an {{executive}} producer on the Fox television series Sit Down, Shut Up in 2009. Oakley ended his involvement with the show due to a contract dispute between the staff and Sony Pictures. Sony refused to offer a contract which operated under the complete terms of the Writers Guild of America. Weinstein continued working on the show. His two subsequent projects have been without Weinstein. In late 2009, NBC commissioned a pilot for Oakley's sitcom about [...] "the youngest judge in a circuit courthouse." [...] He wrote the 2010 episode of The Cleveland Show [...] "Gone with the Wind". Amongst other projects, Oakley planned a live-action show where the characters are all robots, which would be made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> who produce the children's show Yo Gabba Gabba!.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} {{on the special}} {{was similar to that}} of the other episodes, with the hospital scenes being shot in the usual locations (the Northwick Park Hospital in Middlesex and the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke). The script was written by the usual eight-person team led by Victoria Pile, and produced and directed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> who recorded all the previous episodes. The special was recorded at the same time as the second series. The exterior scenes were harder to shoot. In the beginning funeral scene, one of the mourners is Alan Yentob, who had been filming an episode of the BBC One documentary series Imagine. Stephen Mangan said that Martin's mime during the funeral was one of his favourite moments in Green Wing. The opening titles of the episode differ from the others as it does not use the normal theme tune, [...] "Last Week", (as it is named in the [...] ) and instead uses the track, [...] "Camel".|$|E
500|$|Conversely, {{in recent}} times Cosby's {{controversial}} history with women has caused some contemporary critics to question his intentions behind creating a character like Clair {{in the wake of}} a series of sexual assault allegations made against the comedian. In 2014, The Crunk Feminist Collective famously published an article entitled [...] "Clair Huxtable is Dead: On Slaying the Cosbys" [...] in which the author dismissed the character's progressive gender politics as [...] "a sham", arguing that Clair must forgotten to allow for a new generation of television heroines. Nico Lang of The Daily Dot defended the character against such critics, writing that the show's legacy remains significant [...] "to the Clair Huxtables of the world, both the real women she inspired and a generation of characters who owe a debt to her." [...] Writing for Paste, in 2014 Shannon M. Houston maintains that Clair remains beloved as a [...] "feminist hero" [...] <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> who now try to disassociate themselves from both Cosby and The Cosby Show. Kirthana Ramisetti of the New York Daily News agreed that Cosby [...] "can’t detract from Clair’s enduring legacy." [...] John Teti, contributing to The A. V. Club, agreed that [...] "Clair Huxtable’s legacy remains intact" [...] despite [...] "the snowballing disgrace of its star has made The Cosby Show less of a wholesome memory than it once was".|$|E
500|$|Settlers, who {{had spent}} a great deal of money and time in {{building}} their houses and farms, had begun to file for homesteads in the area on the railroad lands starting in 1869, in anticipation of the completion of the line. In 1872, the Central Pacific Railroad completed work to Goshen from the north and the Southern Pacific was to construct the southern portion (although not generally known by the public at the time, the two railroad systems were owned and operated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> although they were technically separate corporations). The SP's brochures had stated the price of the land would be [...] "$2.50 per acre and upwards", leading many people to mistakenly believe that $2.50/acre was a set price. Furthermore, other brochures indicated that any improvements the settlers made to the land would not be counted when the prices were fixed. However, when the settlers attempted to acquire their land, the asking price was significantly greater than that, which SP attributed to rising property values because of the laying of the railroad, although many settlers believed it was due to their own improvements such as irrigation, housing, fences, and barns. Settlers protested against the railroads, but to no avail. A bill in the United States Congress that would have fixed the price at $2.50/acre failed to pass. The Southern Pacific then filed and won a lawsuit in 1878 against the settlers, amidst allegations of court bias (former California Governor Leland Stanford was also president of SP).|$|E

2500|$|The {{notion of}} the 'good bloke' {{has been the subject}} of feminist critique, however. Clementine Ford, for instance, has written that [...] "men who beat women keep being given a free pass <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> who swear up and down that they don't {{tolerate}} violence because they're a 'good bloke'" [...] Similarly, writer Brigid Delaney has said that being a good bloke really [...] "means drinking a lot. It means conforming to the norms of a place and not pushing back. It means protecting your mates and isolating those who take offence or complain." [...] Similarly, the {{notion of the}} good bloke was attacked in the press when Australian rules footballer Bachar Houli was given a reduced suspension for striking another player in the Australian Football League on the grounds that he was a good bloke. Eventually, this penalty was overturned on appeal. The so-called 'good bloke defence' was criticised by many, including AFL official Nathan Burke, who argued that: [...] "If you start bringing in 'this bloke's a good bloke, this bloke's not a good bloke', who are we to actually judge who is a good bloke and who isn't in the first place?" ...|$|E

[...] Kitt supported the groups' efforts to clean up streets and establish recreation areas {{in an effort to keep}} them out of trouble by testifying with them before the House General Subcommittee on Education of the Committee on Education and Labor. In her testimony, in May 1967, Kitt stated that the Rebels' [...] "achievements and accomplishments should certainly make the adult 'do-gooders' realize that these young men and women have performed in 1 short year - with limited finances - that which was not achieved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> who might object to turning over some of the duties of planning, rehabilitation, and prevention of juvenile delinquents and juvenile delinquency to those who understand it and are living it".

60|$|Japan, unlike China, is a {{religious}} country. The Chinese doubt a proposition until it is proved to be true; the Japanese believe it until it is proved to be false. I do not know of any evidence against {{the view that the}} Mikado is divine. Japanese religion is essentially nationalistic, like that of the Jews in the Old Testament. Shinto, the State religion, has been in the main invented since 1868,[88] and propagated by education in schools. (There was of course an old Shinto religion, but most of what constitutes modern Shintoism is new.) It is not a religion which aims at being universal, like Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam; it is a tribal religion, only intended to appeal to the Japanese. Buddhism subsists side by side with it, and is believed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people.</b> It is customary to adopt Shinto rites for marriages and Buddhist rites for funerals, because Buddhism is considered more suitable for mournful occasions. Although Buddhism is a universal religion, its Japanese form is intensely national,[89] like the Church of England. Many of its priests marry, and in some temples the priesthood is hereditary. Its dignitaries remind one vividly of English Archdeacons.|$|E
6000|$|As to the {{district}} of Alfington, the distress was extreme. The people had viewed Mr. Patteson as their exclusive property, and could not forgive the Bishop of New Zealand for, as they imagined, tempting him away. 'Ah! Sir,' was the schoolmistress's answer to some warm words from Mr. Justice Coleridge in praise of Bishop Selwyn, 'he may be--no doubt he is--a very good man. I only wish he had kept his hands off Alfington.' 'It would not be easy,' says the parishioner from whom I have already quoted, 'to describe the intense sorrow in view of separation. Mr. Patteson did all he could to assure us {{that it was his}} own will and act, consequent upon the conviction that it was God's will that he should go, and to exonerate the Bishop, but for some time he was regarded as the immediate cause of our loss; and he never knew half the hard things said of him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> who, when they heard he was coming, and would preach on the Sunday, did their utmost to make themselves and their children look their very best.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Evidently {{ashamed of}} the barbarism {{committed}} by British hands, Vice-Admiral Cochrane attempted to palliate it by a pitiful trick. After {{the destruction of the}} capital, and the invaders were safely back on their vessels in the Patuxent, Cochrane wrote a letter to Secretary Monroe, in which he said to him, 'Having been called upon by the Governor-General of the Canadas to aid him in carrying into effect measures of retaliation against the inhabitants of the United States for the wanton destruction committed by their army in Upper Canada, it has become imperiously my duty, conformably with the Governor-General's application, to issue to the naval force under my command an order to destroy and lay waste such towns and districts upon the coast as may be found assailable.' Cochrane then expressed a hope that the 'conduct of the executive of the United States would authorize him in staying such proceedings, by making reparation to the suffering inhabitants of Upper Canada,' etc. This letter was antedated August 18, or six days before the battle of Bladensburg, so as to appear like a humane suggestion, in the noncompliance with which might be found an excuse for the destruction of the national capital. It did not reach Mr. Monroe until the morning of the 31st of August, a week after Washington was devastated, when that officer, in a dignified reply, reminded the vice-admiral that the wanton destruction by the British of Frenchtown, Frederick, Georgetown, and Havre de Grace, and the outrages at Hampton <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people,</b> had occurred long before the destruction of Newark." ...|$|E
