5000|$|Danes Moss is a lowland raised bog, a {{rare and}} {{threatened}} habitat in the United Kingdom. The SSSI citation describes it as [...] "the largest example in Cheshire of a cut-over raised mire...a valuable example of a habitat now rare in lowland England", noting that the peat is up to 5 m deep, a substantial thickness. Seven species of Sphagnum moss are found here. Locally uncommon plants include round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), <b>bottle</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex rostrata), common lousewort (Pedicularis sylvatica) and fen bedstraw (Galium uliginosum) and the nationally rare Labrador-tea (Rhododendron tomentosum).|$|R
50|$|The hamlet {{is located}} on the B6270 between Thwaite and Keld below Great Shunner Fell and close to a small beck named Skeb Skeugh. The area around this beck, known as Angram Bottoms, has been {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It is made of seven fields covering 24.2 acres supporting a diverse habitat of flora. A combination of mire and wet grassland, due to many sinkholes and springs. Plants in the wet grasslands that can be found here include sharp-flowered rush, lesser spearwort, slender tufted-sedge, <b>bottle</b> <b>sedge,</b> common marsh-bedstraw, northern marsh-orchid, marsh-marigold and meadowsweet. Other areas of marsh support marsh lousewort, carnation sedge, flea sedge, star sedge, marsh valerian and marsh violet.|$|R
50|$|The Achanalt {{reservoir}} and marshes {{were designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest on 18 May 1989 {{as the area}} is an important nesting ground. It is 214.6 ha. in size. The marshes are characterised by mesotrophic grassland on a river valley flood plain. There are two waterlogged Carex Juncus communities that include <b>bottle</b> <b>sedge,</b> marsh pennywort, and bogbean. In a relatively drier area, short grass and sedge occur, mainly in winter. The marshes are sedge dominated, and these include common sedge, carnation sedge, flea sedge, and star sedge. Tawny sedge and dioecious sedge occur in flush line areas. The featured herbs include heath spotted orchid and common valerian. Purple moor grass and tufted hair grass are locally extensive. Four nationally rare species of breeding birds are located here.|$|R
5000|$|The north-facing amphitheatre-shaped {{valley of}} Cwm Idwal with its dark cliffs {{has a unique}} flora, and some plants here are the most southerly {{remnants}} in Britain of the Arctic/Alpine flora. The Snowdon lily (Lloydia serotina) is found here, high on mountain ledges, {{the only place in}} Britain where it is found. Other Alpine species include the purple saxifrage (Saxifraga oppositifolia), tufted saxifrage (Saxifraga cespitosa), Alpine meadow rue (Thalictrum alpinum) and mountain sorrel (Oxyria digyna). Because of the scientific interest of this valley, sheep have been excluded from it to allow the native plants to flourish and it has been made into a National Nature Reserve. The lake itself is shallow and fringed with rushes, reeds and <b>bottle</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex rostrata). Plants growing in the water or on the damp ground nearby include awlwort, pillwort, waterwort and spring quillwort (Isoetes echinospora). Other plants growing on damp shady ledges include the Welsh poppy (Meconopsis cambrica), the wood-rush (Lazula sylvatica), water avens (Geum rivale), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and golden rod (Solidago virgaurea). Animals that live here include badgers, foxes and polecats as well as buzzards (Buteo buteo), peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), skylarks (Alauda arvensis), black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus).|$|R
50|$|The {{visitor to}} the Bullenkuhle comes across a basin-shaped hollow with steep sides of 30 to 60° in places. At {{the foot of the}} slopes of glacial sands is a marsh {{covering}} about 0.5 ha that on closer inspection {{turns out to be a}} 'quaking bog' (Schwingrasen or Schwingmoor) - a floating mat of moss and other plants, under which there is presumably no homogeneous layer of peat, but at least in places just a body of water. The floating mat covers at least 80% of the wetland or marsh, only in the northeast is there stretch of open water about 0.1 ha in area and several metres deep; a so-called bog pond. With an electrolytic conductivity of 24 µS/cm this wetland is very oligotrophic, it is rich in humus and, with a pH value of 5.0, moderately acidic. It is populated by typical marsh plants like peat mosses, bladderworts and the rare Dwarf White Water Lily (Nymphaea candida). In addition to peat mosses, the floating mat pressing in on the bog pond consists mainly of Hare's-tail Cottongrass, Cross-leaved Heath, Common Heather and Crowberry; as well as White Beak-sedge and Cranberry. The largely unwooded terrain can be described as flat to slightly rounded intermediate marsh (Zwischenmoor). On its periphery is a ring-shaped bog, which is slightly better supplied with nutrients from precipitation running down the slopes than the centre of the marsh. <b>Bottle</b> <b>Sedge</b> reeds thrive particularly well here.|$|R
40|$|Vegetation in {{and along}} aquatic systems has {{important}} regulatory and ecological functions. Aquatic vegetation is also frequently {{used as an}} indicator of environmental conditions. To enhance our knowledge of the complex natural processes in the littoral zone, i. e., the zone from the high water mark to the lower limit of aquatic vegetation, it is critical to assess plant occurrence and abundance at the species level. This assessment is traditionally performed with labour-intensive field methods. Recently developed remote sensing systems with unmanned aircrafts that take aerial images at low flying height, offer new possibilities for surveying aquatic and riparian vegetation. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) produce aerial images with sub-decimetre spatial resolution and high spatial accuracy at low cost and are highly flexible in time and space. The goal of this thesis was to evaluate the potential of an UAS for surveying non-submerged aquatic and riparian vegetation, including the identification of plants at the species level and vegetation mapping. Based on produced vegetation maps and field sampling, we also assessed the total biomass of entire riparian zones (320 -m river stretches) and the biomass and trace metal content of dominant species along a pollution gradient. In total, the UAS was tested in four aquatic systems, two lakes and two rivers, in boreal northern Sweden. Generated orthoimages were interpreted visually. The spatial resolution varied from 5 – 5. 6 cm. At two test sites we identified plant species with high accuracy (94. 6 and 80. 4 % for aquatic and riparian vegetation, respectively). Prior knowledge on locally occurring species was necessary for correct species identification. The time needed for manual vegetation mapping increased with increasing vegetation complexity. At the test site for biomass assessment, biomass and trace element (Cu, Cd, and Zn) contents varied considerably between species. Salix sp. (willows) comprised only 3 % of the total dominant-species biomass but contained 73 % of all Cd and 24 % of all Zn. In contrast, Carex rostrata/vesicaria (<b>bottle</b> and blister <b>sedge)</b> comprised 80 % of the total biomass and contained 85 % of all Cu and 66 % of all Zn. This result emphasizes the need for species-specific assessment, for example, in planning of phytoremediation measures. The tested UAS facilitates species-level surveying and mapping of non-submerged aquatic and riparian vegetation and can be used in combination with field sampling to accurately assess biomass and the amount of accumulated contaminants at the scale of entire riparian zones. The main future challenge will be to identify/develop automated methods for vegetation mapping which successfully cope with the inherent complexity of the orthoimages generated with the presented UAS.
