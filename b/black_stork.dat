5|$|Foraging {{for food}} takes place mostly in fresh water, though the <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> may look for food {{on dry land}} at times. The <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. It has been {{observed}} shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E
5|$|Hunters {{threaten}} the <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> {{in some countries}} of southern Europe and Asia, such as Pakistan, and breeding populations may have been eliminated there. The <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> vanished from the Ticino River valley in northern Italy, with hunting a likely contributor. In 2005, black storks were released into the Parco Lombardo del Ticino {{in an attempt to}} re-establish the species there.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> hosts {{more than}} 12 species of helminth, with Cathaemasia hians and Dicheilonema ciconiae {{reported}} {{to be the most}} dominant. The juvenile <b>black</b> <b>stork,</b> although having a less diverse helminth population, is parasitized more frequently than the adult. A new species of Corynebacterium—C. ciconiae—has been isolated from the trachea of healthy black storks, and is thought {{to be part of the}} natural flora of the species. A diverse array of predatory mesostigmatid mites—particularly the genera Dendrolaelaps and Macrocheles—have been recovered from <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> nests. Their role is unknown, though they could prey on parasitic arthropods.|$|E

5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> is {{a member}} of the genus Ciconia, or typical storks, a group of seven extant species, characterised by {{straight}} bills and mainly black and white plumage. The <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> was long thought to be most closely related to the white stork (C. ciconia). However, genetic analysis via DNA–DNA hybridization and mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA by Beth Slikas in 1997 found that it was basal (an early offshoot) in the genus Ciconia. Fossil remains have been recovered from Miocene beds on Rusinga and Maboko Islands in Kenya, which are indistinguishable from the white and black storks.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> is {{considered}} to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but its actual status is uncertain. Despite its large range, it is nowhere abundant, and it appears to be declining in parts of its range, such as in India, China and parts of Western Europe, though increasing in others such as the Iberian Peninsula. Various conservation measures have been taken for the <b>black</b> <b>stork,</b> like the Conservation Action Plan for African black storks by Wetlands International. It is also covered under the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSixteen <b>Black</b> <b>Storks</b> (Ciconia nigra) were {{tracked by}} {{satellite}} during their autumnal and spring migrations {{in order to}} identify their major stopover sites and connections between stopovers in Europe and Africa. Among journeys with stopovers, the longest distance that a stork travelled without stopover was 2433 km (defined here as 'accessible distance') meaning that those storks which have stopovers use only a single stopover on average, and this is usually in Spain. We identified nine crucial stopovers (seven in Spain and two in Africa) with high connectivity highlighting the importance of Spanish stopover locations on the flyway of <b>Black</b> <b>Storks...</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> mainly eats fish, {{including}} small cyprinids, pikes, roaches, eels, budds, perches, burbots, sicklebacks {{and muddy}} loaches (Misgurnus and Cobitis). It may feed on amphibians, small reptiles, crabs, mammals and birds, and invertebrates such as snails, molluscs, earthworms, and insects like water beetles and their larvae.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> prefers more wooded areas {{than the}} better-known white stork, and breeds in large marshy {{wetlands}} with interspersed coniferous or broadleaved woodlands, but also inhabits hills and mountains with sufficient networks of creeks. It usually inhabits ponds, rivers, edges of lakes, estuaries and other freshwater wetlands. The <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> does inhabit more agricultural {{areas in the}} Caspian lowlands, but even here it avoids close contact with people. Its wintering habitat in India comprises reservoirs or rivers with nearby scrub or forest, which provide trees that black storks can roost in at night. In southern Africa it is found in shallow water in rivers or lakes, or swamps, but is occasionally encountered on dry land.|$|E
5|$|After {{disappearing from}} Belgium before {{the onset of}} the 20th century, it has {{returned}} to breed in the Belgian Ardennes, Luxembourg and Burgundy, France, by 2000. It appears to be increasing in numbers in Spain and Portugal, where the population was estimated at 405 to 483 pairs in 2006. The <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> is a rare vagrant to the British Isles, turning up in the warmer months—particularly in spring—generally in the south and east. Sightings have become more common since the 1970s as its breeding range moves northwards. It has been recorded in Scotland six times between 1946 and 1983, including from Shetland, Orkney and the Highlands, as well as the Scottish Borders (Peebles). It is not abundant in the western parts of its distribution, but more densely inhabits eastern Transcaucasia. Further east, it has been recorded from locations across Iran, though little is known about its habits there; breeding has been recorded from near Aliabad in Fars province, Khabr National Park in Kerman province, Karun river in Khuzestan province, Qaranqu River in East Azarbaijan province, and Aliabad river in Razavi Khorasan province. The population has declined in Iran due to draining of wetlands. East of the Ural Mountains, the <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> is patchily found in forested and mountainous areas up to 60°‒63° N across Siberia to the Pacific Ocean. South of Siberia, it breeds in Xinjiang, northwestern China, northern Mongolia south to the Altai Mountains, and northeastern China south to the vicinity of Beijing. In the Korean Peninsula, the <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> is an uncommon summer visitor, no longer breeding in the south since 1966. Birds have been seen in the northeast but it is not known whether they breed there. Similarly it has been seen in the summer in Afghanistan, but its breeding status is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, the <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is {{because it has a}} large range—more than 20,000km2(7,700mi2)—and because its {{population}} is thought not to have declined by 30% over ten years or three generations and thus is not a rapid enough decline to warrant a vulnerable rating. Even so, the state of the population overall is unclear, and although it is widespread, it is not abundant anywhere. <b>Black</b> <b>stork</b> numbers have declined for many years in western Europe, and the species has already been extirpated from Scandinavia. The population in India—a major wintering ground—is declining. Previously a regular winter visitor to the Mai Po Marshes, it is now seldom seen there, and appears to be in decline in China overall. Its habitat is changing rapidly in much of eastern Europe and Asia. Various conservation measures have been taken, including Wetlands International's Conservation Action Plan for African black storks, which focuses on improving the wintering conditions of the birds which breed in Europe. It is protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).|$|E
5|$|Strandzha is {{situated}} on Via Pontica, the second-largest bird migratory route in Europe. The bays and estuaries along the Black Sea coast are a wintering destination for some birds.

5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> breeds between April and May in the Northern Hemisphere, {{with eggs}} usually laid in late April. In {{southern}} Africa, breeding {{takes place in}} the months between September and March, possibly to take advantage of abundant water prey rendered easier to catch as the rivers dry up and recede—from April and May in Zimbabwe, Botswana and northern South Africa, and as late as July further south.|$|E
50|$|The European Union-designated Special Protection Area Dehesas de Jerez covers 480 km² and {{occupies}} approximately {{third of}} the comarca.

40|$|International audienceTo {{determine}} {{what kind of}} factors are implied in the decline of long-distant birds, knowledge on feeding ecology in breeding and wintering areas is essential. We present the first study recording {{the quantity and quality}} of food eaten by a population of <b>black</b> <b>storks</b> (Ciconia nigra) in the Africa wintering zone, as well as prey abundance in the field by testing an eventual foraging strategy based on the selection of biotic parameters of fish preys (body size, energy gain, swimming speed and fish armaments). <b>Black</b> <b>storks</b> selected preferentially two fish species of Siluriforms that were not the most abundant species in the field. Storks carried out interspecific selection according to the swimming speed of fish species and intraspecific selection depending on prey size, probably to avoid defensive armaments of the preferred fish prey. Small fishes consumed by the birds constituted 91 % of the diet and 45 % of the total food energy intake. Small fishes were more frequently caught than large ones, even if the storks sometimes took the opportunity to catch large fishes that provided a high energy gain. Energy assimilation of <b>black</b> <b>storks</b> is almost two-fold higher than the estimated daily energy expenditure. This study suggests that the quantity of food would satisfy the energy requirements of the species during the winter in Africa, enable them to store reserves and ensure their survival on the African areas...|$|R
50|$|Krumovitsa River Valley {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} areas in Bulgaria for breeding <b>black</b> <b>storks</b> (Ciconia nigra) and Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus).

5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> has a {{wider range}} of calls than the white stork, its main call being a chee leee, which sounds like a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like {{squealing}} calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} adult {{remains in the}} nest {{for two to three}} weeks after {{hatching}} to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. <b>Black</b> <b>stork</b> parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, the <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> {{is found}} from Eastern Asia (Siberia and {{northern}} China) west to Central Europe, reaching Estonia in the north, Poland, Lower Saxony and Bavaria in Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy and Greece in the south, with an outlying {{population in the}} central-southwest region of the Iberian Peninsula (Extremadura and surrounding provinces of Spain, plus Portugal). It is migratory, wintering in tropical Africa and Asia, although certain populations of black storks are sedentary or dispersive. An isolated population exists in Southern Africa, where the species is more numerous in the east, in eastern South Africa and Mozambique, and {{is also found in}} Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Botswana and less commonly Namibia.|$|E

5|$|Most of the <b>black</b> <b>storks</b> {{that summer}} in Europe migrate to Africa, {{with those from}} western Germany and points west heading south via the Iberian Peninsula and the rest via Turkey and the Levant. Those flying via Spain spend winter in the Falémé River basin of eastern Senegal, Guinea, {{southern}} Mauritania, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and western and central Mali, while those flying via the Sinai end up in northern Ethiopia, the Kotto River basin in the Central African Republic, the Mbokou river basin in Chad and northeastern Nigeria. <b>Black</b> <b>storks</b> summering in western Asia migrate to northern and northeastern India, ranging mainly from Punjab south to Karnataka, and Africa. They are occasional visitors to Sri Lanka. Those summering further east in eastern Russia and China winter mainly in southern China, and occasionally in Hong Kong, Myanmar, northern Thailand, and Laos. They were first recorded in western Myanmar in 1998.|$|R
5|$|Unlike the {{closely related}} white stork, the <b>black</b> <b>stork</b> is a shy and wary species. It is seen singly or in pairs, usually in marshy areas, rivers or inland waters. It feeds on amphibians, small fish and insects, {{generally}} wading slowly {{in shallow water}} stalking its prey. Breeding pairs usually build nests in large forest trees—most commonly deciduous but also coniferous—which {{can be seen from}} long distances, as well as on large boulders, or under overhanging ledges in mountainous areas. The female lays two to five greyish-white eggs, which become soiled over time in the nest. Incubation takes 32 to 38 days,with both sexes sharing duties, and fledging takes 60 to 71 days.|$|E

Five strains were genotypically identified as representing Corynebacterium falsenii, whereas the remaining three strains represented a hitherto unknown subline, associated with a small subcluster of species that includes Corynebacterium mastitidis and its close relatives. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown isolates from <b>black</b> <b>storks</b> represent a novel species within the genus Corynebacterium, for which the Corynebacterium ciconiae sp. nov. is proposed.
