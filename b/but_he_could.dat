5|$|Erik Palladino as Keith Griffin, {{a gay man}} {{dying of}} AIDS, {{drowning}} in his own bitterness and despair until befriended by Christian. Cox said that Palladino's performance was not how he originally envisioned it, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not now imagine a different person playing Keith.|$|E

5|$|A classic {{victory was}} within his grasp <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> almost feel his adversary's breath on his neck. Somehow Garin {{held on to}} his lead of two metres, two little metres for a legendary victory. The stands {{exploded}} and the ovation united the two men. Garin exulted under the cheers of the crowd. Cordang cried bitter tears of disappointment.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond's wife, Alice, was {{the second}} {{daughter}} of Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Morphia of Melitene. Their only child, Constance, was two when Bohemond died in 1130. Alice tried to secure the regency for Constance for herself, but the Antiochene noblemen preferred her father, Baldwin II of Jerusalem. After Bohemond's death, Roger II of Sicily laid claim to Antioch, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never assert it against Constance.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels, however, wanted more, {{and he saw}} in Wessel's {{shooting}} {{the possibility of a}} propaganda bonanza. The beginning of his plan was to turn Wessel's funeral into a mass demonstration full of speeches and processions of SA men in uniform, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not get the necessary police permits to do so, even after Wessel's sister requested Hindenburg to relent.|$|E
5|$|György Borbély, Ban of Karánsebes, {{captured}} Lippa (now Lipova in Romania) {{and other}} Ottoman fortresses along the Maros River {{before the end}} of August. Koca Sinan Pasha broke into Wallachia, forcing Michael the Brave to retreat towards Transylvania. Michael routed the invaders in the Battle of Călugăreni, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not prevent them from seizing Târgoviște and Bucharest. He withdrew to Stoenești to await the arrival of the Transylvanian and Moldavian troops.|$|E

60|$|Leaning on the sill, Aynsley drank in {{the soft}} night air, which struck on his {{forehead}} pleasantly cool. He admitted that <b>he</b> was anxious, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> keep his apprehensions under good control.|$|R
5|$|In 1964, Altgens testified for the Warren Commission and {{was asked}} about the gunfire and whether he knew its source. He said he had not been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he {{believed}} them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot that came from the vicinity of the book depository building, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not say with any certainty.|$|E
5|$|Michael the Brave, Voivode of Wallachia, and Ștefan Răzvan, Voivode of Moldavia, {{acknowledged}} his suzerainty. Their united forces defeated an Ottoman {{army in the}} Battle of Giurgiu. The triumph {{was followed}} by a series of Ottoman victories, and Sigismund abdicated in favor of Rudolph II in early 1598, receiving the duchies of Racibórz and Opole as a compensation. His maternal uncle, Stephen Bocskai, persuaded him to return in late summer, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not make peace with the Ottoman Empire. He renounced Transylvania in favor of Andrew Báthory and settled in Poland in 1599. During the following years, Transylvania was regularly pillaged by unpaid mercenaries and Ottoman marauders. Sigismund returned {{at the head of a}} Polish army in 1601, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not strengthen his position. He again abdicated in favor of Rudolph and settled in Bohemia in July 1602. After he was accused of a conspiracy against the emperor, he spent fourteen months in jail in Prague in 1610 and 1611. He died at his Bohemian estate.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the film}} first emerged under the working title of Local Hero in January 2013. Jean-Claude Van Damme was rumored to be co-starring {{alongside}} Jaa, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not commit due to scheduling issues; he was filming Swelter at the time. Dolph Lundgren was cast as an alternative.|$|E

5|$|Zersenay took {{third place}} at the 2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in a closely contested race, {{finishing}} just behind a resurgent Gebregziabher Gebremariam and Ugandan runner Moses Kipsiro. He competed in his first ever full-length marathon in April, signing up for the London Marathon. His first appearance over the distance was much anticipated following his cross country and track success, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not finish the race, pulling out around the 35km mark.|$|E
5|$|A libertinus was not {{entitled}} to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play a priestly role in {{the cult of the}} emperor. He could not marry a woman from a family of senatorial rank, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law. Any future children of a freedman would be born free, with full rights of citizenship.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Barkley went to Emory College (now part of Emory University) in Oxford, Georgia, the {{alma mater}} of several administrators {{and faculty members}} at Marvin. During the 1897–1898 {{academic}} year, he {{was active in the}} debating society and the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not afford to continue his education and returned to Clinton after the spring semester. He took a job teaching at Marvin College but did not make enough money to meet his basic living expenses. He resigned in December 1898 to move with his parents to Paducah, Kentucky, the county seat of McCracken County, where his father found employment at a cordage mill.|$|E

5|$|Amir's brigade {{began to}} reach the plain between Artillery Road and the Firdan bridge at 09:00. So far no Egyptian {{resistance}} of any significance had been encountered. The brigade had the objective of attacking 2nd Division's bridgehead. Abu Sa'ada, the division commander, had the 24th Armored Brigade as the divisional reserve, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only commit it {{in case of an}} Israeli penetration. Gonen wanted Adan {{to reach the}} Hizayon strongpoint, and contacted Elazar in Tel Aviv at 09:55 to request a crossing of the canal. Gonen either downplayed or ignored negative reports and only told Elazar of positive developments. Elazar, who was at a meeting, communicated with Gonen through his assistant and approved of a crossing, also giving permission for Sharon's division to move south.|$|E
5|$|At Star Treks creation, Norway Productions, Roddenberry's {{production}} company, {{shared ownership}} with Desilu Productions and, after Gulf+Western acquired Desilu in 1967, with Paramount Pictures, the conglomerate's film studio. Paramount {{did not want}} to own the unsuccessful show; net profit was to be shared between Norway, Desilu/Paramount, Shatner, and NBC but Star Trek lost money, and the studio did not expect to syndicate it. In 1970 Paramount offered to sell all rights to Star Trek to Roddenberry, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not afford the $150,000 ($ in 2007) price.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond made an {{alliance}} with Az-Zahir Ghazi, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo, and Kaykaus I, the Seljuq sultan of Rum, who often invaded Cilicia during the following years, to prevent Leo I from attacking Antioch. Conflicts between Bohemond and the Latin Patriarchs of Antioch enabled Raymond-Roupen to seize Antioch in 1216, but Bohemond regained the principality in 1219. After Leo I's death, Bohemond tried to secure Cilicia to his younger son, Philip, but Constantine of Baberon, who had administered Cilicia during the previous years, imprisoned Philip in 1224. Bohemond allied with Kayqubad I, sultan of Rum, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not prevent Philip's murder in 1225.|$|E

5|$|Clark's {{ultimate}} goal during the Revolutionary War was {{to seize the}} British-held fort at Detroit, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never recruit enough men and acquire sufficient munitions to make the attempt. Kentucky militiamen generally preferred to defend their homes by staying closer to Kentucky, instead of making a long and potentially perilous expedition to Detroit. Clark returned to the Falls of the Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued to defend the Ohio River valley {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fights}} for the ramparts of Wola, only {{artillery}} {{of the second}} line gave limited support to the outnumbered Polish troops. Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the first line, but apparently none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division manning the second line, could have supported the forts of the first line, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not {{see what was happening}} in Fort 56 due to dense smoke and the trees of Brühl's Garden.|$|E
5|$|On 12 July 1936, in Madrid, {{a member}} of the Falange named Jorge Bardina murdered Lieutenant José Castillo of the Assault Guards police force. Castillo was {{a member of}} the Socialist party. The next day, members of the Assault Guards arrested José Calvo Sotelo, a leading Spanish monarchist and a {{prominent}} parliamentary conservative; the original target was Gil Robles <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not be found. Calvo Sotelo had protested against agricultural reforms, expropriations, and restrictions on the authority of the Catholic Church, which he considered Bolshevist and anarchist. He instead advocated the creation of a corporative state. Calvo Sotelo was shot by the Guards without trial.|$|E
