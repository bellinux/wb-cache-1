5|$|Somehow King {{walked in}} {{the front door of the}} jail and a few minutes later out the back. King had {{arranged}} with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nugget) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.|$|E
25|$|He later {{switched}} to the oud, a much more common instrument, and was accepted into the Baghdad Music Academy {{at the age of}} twenty-one. Although keen to break through in the music business with his songs and voice, he found himself rebuffed by all the producers he approached, who would only let him sing their own material. Instead, he used the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> gain entry to the industry.|$|E
25|$|On March 19, King {{was escorted}} {{in the front}} door of the jail and let out the back a few minutes later.

25|$|In 1964, Monte Hellman and Jack Nicholson {{had made}} two films together, <b>Back</b> <b>Door</b> <b>to</b> Hell and Flight to Fury, which were {{produced}} by Roger Corman and filmed back-to-back in the Philippines. After completing the films, {{the director and}} actor wrote a screenplay called Epitaph and presented it to Corman to produce. Corman did not care for the script but asked if the two {{would be willing to}} do a western for him instead. When they expressed an interest, Corman further suggested that they film two westerns, {{in a manner similar to}} the Philippine-shot movies they had just finished. They agreed and, while Nicholson started working on the script for Ride in the Whirlwind, Hellman asked their mutual friend Carole Eastman to write The Shooting.|$|E
25|$|Simpson's initial {{claim that}} he was asleep {{at the time of}} the murders was refuted by several {{different}} accounts. According to defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, Simpson had never left his house that night, and he was alone as he packed his belongings to travel to Chicago. Cochran claimed that Simpson went outside through the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> hit a few golf balls into the children's sandbox in the front garden, one or more of which made the three loud thumps on the wall of Kaelin's bungalow. Cochran produced a potential alibi witness, Rosa Lopez, a neighbor's Spanish-speaking housekeeper who testified that she had seen Simpson's car parked outside his house {{at the time of the}} murders. But Lopez's testimony, which was not presented to the jury, was pulled apart under intense cross-examination by Clark, when Lopez was forced to admit that she could not be sure of the precise time she saw Simpson's white Bronco outside his house.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Cardi {{analyzed}} the present-day influence that Palsgraf {{has had on}} state courts. He found that neither Cardozo nor Andrews has won {{on the question of}} how duty of care is formulated, with courts applying policy analyses. [...] "As to the proper doctrinal home for plaintiff-foreseeability, Cardozo has undoubtedly prevailed. Although a clear majority of jurisdictions state that duty is the proper home for plaintiff-foreseeability, Cardozo's vision of foreseeability as a categorical determination has not been widely adopted." [...] But, he noted, [...] "Andrews may have found a <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> victory. Arguably the most important consequence of the Palsgraf decision, the resolution of the judge/jury question, appears to lean in Andrews' direction. A majority of courts prefer to leave foreseeability—even as a part of duty—to the jury." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a <b>back</b> <b>door</b> is <b>to</b> {{maintain}} a communication channel and having methods to control a host that has been gained entry to. These methods include those for file transfer and the execution of programs. It is often important {{to make sure that}} the access or communication remains secret. And access control is desirable in order to prevent others from using the <b>back</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
500|$|On 5 June 2003 Gjelsten told Koppel {{he could}} not go on subsidising Wimbledon F.C., and {{withheld}} the scheduled monthly injection of £800,000. Koppel declared Wimbledon F.C. insolvent {{the next day and}} put it into administration with reported debts of £3.5million. John Gurney, who had just become the chairman of Luton Town following a takeover by a consortium from Hong Kong and the United States, briefly floated the idea of buying Wimbledon F.C. and merging it with Luton, in his words [...] "effectively buying a <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> Division One" [...] (Luton were in the division below), but was soon after ousted by Luton supporters. In late June, after Wimbledon F.C. missed a deadline to invest in renovations to the Hockey Stadium, the National Hockey Foundation pulled out of discussions over the ground's use, creating confusion as to where the club would now be located. The administrators stated on 27 June that as things stood the move to Milton Keynes was off. A week later, after Watford had refused to let Wimbledon F.C. share their ground at Vicarage Road, the administrators announced a return to Selhurst Park.|$|E
500|$|World War II guerrilla {{movement}} in the Philippines has also garnered attention in Hollywood films such as Back to Bataan, <b>Back</b> <b>Door</b> <b>to</b> Hell, [...] American Guerrilla in the Philippines, Cry of Battle and the more contemporary John Dahl film The Great Raid. Filipino and Japanese films have also paid homage to the valiancy of the Filipino guerrillas during the occupation, such as , In the Bosom of the Enemy, [...] and the critically acclaimed Japanese film Fires on the Plain. There have been various memorials and monuments erected to commemorate {{the actions of the}} Filipino guerrillas. Among such as the Filipino Heroes Memorial in Corregidor, the Luis Taruc Memorial in San Luis, Pampanga, the bronze statue of a Filipino guerrilla in Corregidor, Balantang National Shrine in Jaro, Iloilo City to commemorate the 6th Military District that liberated the provinces of Panay, Romblon, and Guimaras, and the NL Military Shrine and Park in La Union. The Libingan ng mga Bayani (translated to Cemetery of the Heroes), which houses many historical Filipino national heroes, erected a special monument to pay respect to the numerous unnamed Filipino guerrillas who fought in the occupation.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 2005, the {{existence}} of STELLARWIND was revealed by Thomas Tamm. In 2006, Mark Klein revealed {{the existence}} of Room 641A that he had wired back in 2003. In 2008, Babak Pasdar, a computer security expert, and CEO of Bat Blue publicly revealed {{the existence of}} the [...] "Quantico circuit", that he and his team found in 2003.

2500|$|The {{orthodox}} interpretation blamed Hitler and Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan {{for causing}} the war. Revisionist historians of World War II, notably Charles A. Beard, said the U.S. was {{partly to blame}} because it pressed the Japanese too hard in 1940–41 and rejected compromises. Other notable contributions to this discussion include Charles Tansill, <b>Back</b> <b>Door</b> <b>To</b> War (Chicago, 1952); Frederic Sanborn, Design For War (New York, 1951); and David Hoggan, The Forced War (Costa Mesa, 1989). [...] British historian A. J. P. Taylor ignited a firestorm when he argued Hitler was a rather ordinary diplomat and did not deliberately set out to cause a war.|$|E
2500|$|To garner public support, Beaumarchais {{published}} a four-part pamphlet entitled Mémoires contre Goezman. [...] The action made Beaumarchais an instant celebrity, {{for the public}} at the time saw Beaumarchais as a champion for social justice and liberty. Goezman countered Beaumarchais's accusations by launching a lawsuit of his own. [...] The verdict was equivocal. [...] On 26 February 1774, both Beaumarchais and Mme. Goezman (who had taken the bribe from Beaumarchais) were sentenced to [...] "blâme" [...] meaning they were nominally deprived of their civil rights. Naturally, Beaumarchais followed few of the restrictions placed upon him. Magistrate Goezman was removed from his post. [...] At the same time, Goezman's verdict in the La Blache case was overturned. [...] The Goezman case was so sensational that the judges left the courtroom through a <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> avoid the large, angry mob waiting {{in front of the}} court house.|$|E
2500|$|The {{northern}} end of Österlånggatan forms a discreet and informal <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the old town; recessed {{in a corner of}} the prestigious Slottsbacken it can be hard to even discover, and as the narrow {{northern end}} is squeezed between tall façades, it is easy to misinterpret the street as yet another of the many alleys. [...] The first block is, however, flanked by two buildings worth a brief note: [...] On the right side is the rear face of the Royal Coin Cabinet, housing a royal collection begun in the 16th century, and on the left is Number 1, a building started in 1897 and completed in 1950 to the plans of Ivar Tengbom (1878–1968), more famous as the architect behind Stockholm School of Economics and Stockholm Concert Hall the windows facing Telegrafgränd, the first alley, gives a clear idea of what the building looked like at the time, in sharp contrast to the 18th-century stone portal on the opposite side of the alley.|$|E
