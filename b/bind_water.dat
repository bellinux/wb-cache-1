It <b>binds</b> <b>water,</b> cations (such as Ca2+, Na+ and K+), fatty acids, hormones, bilirubin, {{thyroxine}} (T4) and pharmaceuticals (including barbiturates): its main function is to regulate the Oncotic pressure of blood. Alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-fetoglobulin) is a fetal plasma protein that binds various cations, fatty acids and bilirubin. Vitamin D-binding protein binds to vitamin D and its metabolites, {{as well as to}} fatty acids. The isoelectric point of albumin is 4.9.|$|R
50|$|Gluten forms when {{glutenin}} molecules cross-link {{to form a}} submicroscopic network {{attached to}} gliadin, which contributes viscosity (thickness) and extensibility to the mix. If this dough is leavened with yeast, fermentation produces carbon dioxide bubbles, which, trapped by the gluten network, cause the dough to rise. Baking coagulates the gluten, which, along with starch, stabilizes {{the shape of the}} final product. Gluten content has been implicated as a factor in the staling of bread, possibly because it <b>binds</b> <b>water</b> through hydration.|$|R

This is not a dosage that would be encountered in normal consumption of foodstuffs. This study set out to examine the use of xanthan gum as a laxative. As described above, xanthan gum <b>binds</b> <b>water</b> very efficiently, which significantly aids passing stools. Some people react to much smaller amounts of xanthan gum with symptoms of intestinal bloating and diarrhea.|$|R

50|$|Myxedema {{describes}} a specific form of cutaneous and dermal edema secondary to increased deposition of connective tissue components. The connective fibres {{are separated by}} an increased amount of protein and mucopolysaccharides. These can include glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and other mucopolysaccharides. This protein-mucopolysaccharide complex <b>binds</b> <b>water,</b> producing non-pitting boggy edema, in particular around eyes, hands, feet and in the supraclavicular fossae. Myxoedema {{is responsible for the}} thickening of the tongue and the laryngeal and pharnygeal mucous membranes, which results in thick slurred speech and hoarseness, both of which are seen commonly in hypothyroidism.|$|R
50|$|Amylose {{is also an}} {{important}} thickener, water binder, emulsion stabilizer, and gelling agent in both industrial and food-based contexts. Loose helical amylose chains have a hydrophobic interior that can bind to hydrophobic molecules such as lipids and aromatic compounds. The one problem with this is that, when it crystallizes or associates, it can lose some stability, often releasing water in the process (syneresis). When amylose concentration is increased, gel stickiness decreases but gel firmness increases. When other things including amylopectin bind to amylose, the viscosity can be affected, but incorporating κ-carrageenan, alginate, xanthan gum, or low-molecular-weight sugars can reduce the loss in stability. The ability to <b>bind</b> <b>water</b> can add substance to food, possibly serving as a fat replacement. For example, amylose is responsible for causing white sauce to thicken, but, upon cooling, some separation between the solid and the water will occur.|$|E
5000|$|The aromatic/arginine or [...] "ar/R" [...] {{selectivity}} filter is {{a cluster}} of amino acids that help bind to water molecules and exclude other molecules that may try to enter the pore. It is the mechanism by which the aquaporin is able to selectively <b>bind</b> <b>water</b> molecules (hence allowing them through) and prevent other molecules from entering. The ar/R filter is made of two amino acid groups from helices B (HB) and E (HE) and two groups from loop E (LE1, LE2), from {{the two sides of}} the NPA motif. Its usual position is 8 Å on the outer side of the NPA motif; it is typically the tightest part of the channel. Its narrowness weakens the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, enabling the arginines, which carry a positive charge, to interact with the water molecules and to filter out undesirable protons.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen bonding is {{a strong}} intermolecular force that forms a special type of dipole-dipole attraction. Hydrogen bonds form when a {{hydrogen}} atom bonded to a strongly electronegative atom is around another electronegative atom with a lone pair of electrons. Hydrogen bonds are stronger than normal dipole-dipole interactions and dispersion forces but they remain weaker than covalent and ionic bonds. In hydrogels, structure and stability of water molecules are highly affected by the bonds. The polar groups in the polymer strongly <b>bind</b> <b>water</b> molecules and form hydrogen bonds which also cause hydrophobic effects to occur. These hydrophobic effects can be exploited to design chemically crosslinked hydrogels that exhibit self healing abilities. The hydrophobic effects combined with the hydrophilic effects within the hydrogel structure can be balanced through dangling side chains that mediates the hydrogen bonding that occurs between two separate hydrogel pieces or across a ruptured hydrogel.|$|E

5000|$|The {{structure}} of HindIII is complex, {{and consists of}} a homodimer. Like other type II restriction endonucleases, it is believed to contain a common structural core comprising four β-sheets and a single α-helix. Each subunit contains 300 amino acids and the predicted molecular mass is 34,950 Da. Despite {{the importance of this}} enzyme in molecular biology and DNA technology, little information is available concerning the mechanism of DNA recognition and phosphodiester bond cleavage. [...] However, it is believed that HindIII utilizes a common mechanism of recognition and catalysis of DNA found in other type II enzymes such as EcoRI, BamHI, and BglII. These enzymes contain the amino acid sequence motif PD-(D/E)XK to coordinate Mg2+, a cation required to cleave DNA in most type II restriction endonucleases. [...] The cofactor Mg2+ is believed to <b>bind</b> <b>water</b> molecules and carry them to the catalytic sites of the enzymes, among other cations. Unlike most documented type II restriction endonucleases, HindIII is unique in that it has little to no catalytic activity when Mg2+ is substituted for other cofactors, such as Mn2+.|$|E

40|$|Small ions of high charge density (kosmotropes) <b>bind</b> <b>water</b> {{molecules}} strongly, whereas large monovalent ions of low charge density (chaotropes) <b>bind</b> <b>water</b> molecules weakly {{relative to}} the strength of water-water interactions in bulk solution. The standard heat of solution of a crystalline alkali halide is shown here to be negative (exothermic) only when one ion is a kosmotrope and the ion of opposite charge is a chaotrope; this standard heat of solution is known to become proportionally more positive as the difference between the absolute heats of hydration of the corresponding gaseous anion and cation decreases. This suggests that inner sphere ion pairs are preferentially formed between oppositely charged ions with matching absolute enthalpies of hydration, and that biological organization arises from the noncovalent association of moieties with matching absolute free energies of solution, except where free energy is expended to keep them apart. The major intracellular anions (phosphates and carboxylates) are kosmotropes, whereas the major intracellular monovalent cations (K+; arg, his, and lys side chains) are chaotropes; together they form highly soluble, solvent-separated ion pairs that keep the contents of the cell in solution...|$|E
30|$|HA is a {{naturally}} occurring polysaccharide in healthy soft tissue, which binds the collagen and elastic fibres to provide intercellular stability. The naturally occurring HA {{has a very}} short half-life. Pre-processing and cross-linking prolong the half-life of HA before its use as filler [43, 49]. Depending on cross-linking HA fillers {{can be divided into}} cohesive (monophasic) or non-cohesive (biphasic) gels. The cohesive gel disperses diffusely to fill the small gaps between collagen and elastin bundles, whereas the non-cohesive gel deposits in puddles [44, 50]. The injected HA combines with natural HA in the soft tissue, <b>binds</b> <b>water</b> due to its hygroscopic nature and also induces new collagen formation. Thus, a volume is created, which may last for a few months to 1 year [51 – 53]. HA fillers are the most widely used fillers for their safety, easy reversibility, and minimal side effects.|$|R
