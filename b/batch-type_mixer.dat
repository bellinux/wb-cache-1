30|$|We {{report a}} high-yield, {{low-cost}} synthesis route to colloidal CuInS 2 /ZnS (CIS/ZnS) nanocrystals (NCs) with Cu vacancies in the crystal lattice. Yellow-emitting CIS/ZnS core/shell NCs of high luminescence were facilely synthesized via a stepwise, consecutive hybrid flow reactor approach. It {{is based on}} serial combination of a <b>batch-type</b> <b>mixer</b> and a flow-type furnace. In this reactor, the flow rate of the solutions was typically 1  mL/min, 100 times larger than that of conventional microfluidic reactors. This method can produce gram quantities of material with a chemical yield in excess of 90 % with minimal solvent waste. This is a noninjection-based approach in 1 -dodecanethiol (DDT) with excellent synthetic reproducibility and large-scale capability. The optical features {{and structure of the}} obtained CIS/ZnS NCs have been characterized by UV–vis and fluorescence spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The resulting CIS/ZnS NCs in chloroform exhibit quantum yield (QY) of 61.4 % with photoemission peaking at 561  nm and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 92  nm. The as-synthesized CIS/ZnS NCs were proven to have excellent photostability. The synthesized CIS/ZnS NCs can be a promising fluorescent probe for biological imaging and color converting material for light-emitting diode due to Cd-free constituents.|$|E
