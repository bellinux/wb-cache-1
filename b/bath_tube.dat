40|$|RESUMEN: El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar una de las domus del Municipium Augustam Bilbilis (Calatayud, Zaragoza), denominada como Domus del Balneum o Domus 1, excavada durante las campañas arqueológicas de 1997 - 1999. En esta vivienda, datada en el s. I d. C. se descubrió una pequeña instalación termal, atípica por su ubicación y configuración arquitectónica, provista de hipocaustum, bañera y letrina. La disposición de este elemento dentro de la vivienda respondía a la {{necesidad}} del patronus de reafirmar su condición social y económica a través de estos símbolos de ostentación, más cuando en su proximidad, al otro lado de la calle, se ubicaba una de las termas de la ciudad. De este modo, presentamos el análisis de un tema “oscuro” en la producción científica como son las instalaciones sanitarias, especialmente las letrinas, ubicadas en el contexto de los yacimientos hispanos, así como alguno de sus paralelos en otras provincias romanas. ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this article}} is to expose a singular Roman domus of Bilbilis (Calatayud, Zaragoza), the so-called Domus del Balneum where there was a private sanitary system found. The existence of such a balneum results curious as its equipment would have been fairly expensive and in fact quite unnecessary because of the close proximity of the public baths. This balneum built approximately in the 1 st century A. D. might have been associated to a wealthy citizen; in that case such an emblematic space would have allowed him to reaffirm his social and economic status. The balneum of Bilbilis was composed of a latrine and a <b>bath</b> <b>tube.</b> Misfortunately, almost nothing can be said about the latrine as apart of a hole in the pavement we don’t have any more evidence. The dimensions of the rectangular shaped <b>bath</b> <b>tube</b> were 1. 8 x 1. 2 m and it was made of adobe and masonry with its proper hipocaustum. The water was warmed immersing previously heated up iron refuse. Analysing the emplacement and the execution of the balneum we must remark that the edges of the floor were sealed off with a curve layer to prevent leakages and a gap of a bronze drain pipe that it would seem evacuated the spilt water out of the house. Until now it hasn’t been possible to find out whether this pipe was connected to a sewer of the public baths. We suggest that the functioning of the balneum implied the permanent existence of offensive smells and the abundance of flies. This statement could be proved observing the installation of the recipient in order to collect the waste water in the part of hipocaustum at the permanent exposure of heat. Although very little is known about sanitary conditions in the cities of Hispania, a growing body of archaeological evidence all over the Roman Empire reveals drainage systems and private sanitary installations of a relatively sophisticated kind. </p...|$|E

5000|$|The {{buildings}} {{facing the}} surrounding blocks are traditional 5 - 6 floors residential buildings forming a wall around Röda Bergen. From the monumental eastern entrance, an avenue (Rödabergsgatan) leads west to a round elevated space where a church was originally planned. Perpendicular to this avenue, the heavily trafficked Torsgatan {{cuts through the}} area. The blocks within Röda Bergen are limited to 2 - 3 floors {{and most of the}} backyards are open in one end, which allows for plenty of sun light and series of spaces appealing to the eye. Hallman's design was a sharp break with the contemporary narrow, dark, and often filthy backyards. In contrast to them, the involved architects [...] - [...] including Björn Hedwall, Paul Hedqvist, and Sven Wallander [...] - [...] carefully detailed the façades and gables facing the interior with simple classical ornaments and warm red and yellow colours. Of the 2.500 flats in the area, many included novelties such as warm and cold water, WC, and even <b>bath</b> <b>tubes,</b> but most of them were small [...] - [...] half of them was a single room with a kitchen or even less.|$|R

30|$|Another {{somewhat}} dated {{method to}} test the spontaneous heating involves {{a comparison of the}} temperature histories (i.e., plots of temperature versus time) of two cotton balls (one oily and one as a blank), placed some distance apart from each other inside a light steel tube, known as the Ordway apparatus. The tube is then heated by an external air <b>bath</b> surrounding the <b>tube.</b> Fresh air is supplied to the sample and the two balls receive the same heat. Unfortunately, this method was found not to yield reproducible results (Thompson 1928).|$|R

Based on heat transfer with air to samples in sealed capillary tubes, the apparatus resembles a recirculating hair dryer. The temperature is regulated via thermocouple input to a programmable set-point process controller that provides proportional output to a solid state relay controlling a heating coil. For efficient cooling after the denaturation step, the controller activates a solenoid that opens a door to vent hot air and allows cool air to enter. Temperature-time profiles and amplification results approximate those obtained using water <b>baths</b> and microfuge <b>tubes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Possible {{drawbacks}} of microreactors are inefficient reactant mixing due to {{the predominance}} of laminar flow and clogging (when solid-forming reactions are performed or solid catalyst suspensions are used).

40|$|Switch {{tubes are}} used in nuclear weapon firing sets and are {{required}} to be reliable and impervious to gas permeation for many years. To accomplish this, a gold plated coating of approximately 25 microns is required over all metal surfaces on the tube exterior. The gold has historically been plated using gold cyanide plating chemistry. In this work we proposed to replace the cyanide plating bath with an environmentally friendlier sulfite gold plating bath. Low and high pH sulfite plating chemistries were investigated as possible replacements for the cyanide gold plating chemistry. The low pH plating chemistry demonstrated a gold plated coating which met the high purity, grain size, and hardness requirements for switch tubes. The high pH chemistry was rejected primarily because the hardness of the gold plated coatings was too high and exceeded switch tube coating requirements. A problem with nodule formation on the gold plated surface using the low pH chemistry had to be resolved during this evaluation. The nodule formation was postulated to be produced by generation of SO{sub 2 } in the low pH bath causing gold to be precipitated out when the sulfite concentration falls below a minimum level. The problem was resolved by maintaining a higher sulfite concentration and providing an active filtration system during plating. In this initial study, there were no major obstacles found when using a sulfite gold <b>bath</b> for switch <b>tube</b> plating, however, further work is needed on bath control and bath life before adopting it as the primary plating chemistry...|$|R
40|$|A bstract Research, {{pilot scale}} and field {{developments}} of In-Situ Combustion (ISC) for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in shallow, low pressure, heavy oil reservoirs intensified {{between the first}} and the second oil crisis from 1973 to 1981. A decline of interest in EOR followed the collapse of the oil prices in 1986. Renewed interest on in-situ combustion EOR research in the late 1980 ’s and beginning of the 1990 ’s was expanded and focused on high pressure medium and light oil reservoirs. The applicability of air injection in deep high pressure light petroleum reservoirs was established by research work of Greaves et al. in 1987 & 1988, Yannimaras et al. in 1991 and Ramey et a l in 1992. Accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) tests were used to screen the applicability of various types of light oil reservoirs for in-situ combustion EOR by Yannimaras and Tiffin in 1994. The most successful light oil air injection project in the 1990 s in the Medicine Pole Hills Unit, Williston Basin, N. Dakota started in 1987 and was reported by Kumar, Fassihi & Yannimaras, in 1994. Low temperature oxidation of light North Sea petroleum was studied at the University of Bath. A high-pressure combustion tube laboratory system was built at Bath University to evaluate performance of medium and light petroleum in-situ combustion processes. Gravity effects and the impact of horizontal wells in Forced Flow In-Situ Combustion Drainage Assisted by Gravity (FFISCDAG) were studied with three-dimensional combustion experiments. In this study, the university of <b>Bath</b> combustion <b>tube</b> experiments have been simulated and history matched. The tube experiments were up-scaled and field simulation studies were performed. A generic PVT characterization scheme based on 5 hydrocarbon pseudo-components was used, which was validated for light Australian and medium ‘Clair’ oil. A generic chemical reaction characterization scheme was used, which was validated for light Australian and medium ‘Clair’ oil. Advanced PVT and chemical reaction characterizations have been recommended for future work with more powerful hardware platforms. Extensive front track and flame extinction studies were performed to evaluate the performance of currently available non-iso-thermal simulators and to appraise their necessity in air injection processes. Comparative ISC field scale numerical simulation studies of Clair medium oil and light Australian petroleum were based on up-scaled combustion tube experimental results. These studies showed higher than expected hydrocarbon recovery in alternative EOR processes for both pre and post water flood implementation of ISC. Further in this study field scale numerical simulation studies revealed high incremental hydrocarbon recovery was possible by gravity assisted forced flow. The applicability of light oil ISC to gas condensate and sour petroleum reservoirs has been examined in this study with promising results. Light petroleum ISC implemented by a modified water flood including oxidants such as H 2 O 2 and NH 4 NO 3 are expected to widen the applicability of ISC processes in medium and light petroleum reservoirs, especially water flooded North Sea reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Strenuous aerobic {{exercise}} {{is known to}} disrupt innate immune function for up to 24 -h, resulting {{in a period of}} time where individuals are more likely to get sick; granulocytes {{play a key role in}} this innate immune response. Recently our laboratory validated a new, image-based method of simultaneously assessing granulocyte phagocytosis and oxidative burst to divide granulocytes into high-, moderate-, and low-active phenotypes. The purpose of the present study was to use image-based flow cytometry method to assess the effect of strenuous {{aerobic exercise}} on the change in granulocyte activation phenotype. Methods. After providing their informed consent, subjects were asked to complete 60 -min of treadmill exercise (4, 15 -min intervals: 7 -min fast walking, 8 -min jogging). Blood was collected prior to exercise, immediately after, 2 -h, and 4 -h post exercise. Heparinized blood (100 mL) was mixed with S. aureus bioparticles-pHrodo (Life Technologies; 100 mL) and Dihydroethidium (DHE; Sigma-Aldrich; 2. 5 mg/mL) in 4 identical tubes and each incubated for 10, 20, or 40 -min in a 37 °C water <b>bath.</b> An additional <b>tube</b> kept on ice and used as a negative control. All subsequent processing steps were completed on ice in the dark to minimize additional activation of cells. Following the water bath incubation, N-ethylmaleimide (10 mM) was added to halt phagocytosis, preventing the uptake of additional bioparticles. Suspensions were labeled with CD 66 b-APC (eBioscience; DF: 50) and CD 45 -APCeFluor 780 (eBioscience; DF: 50) for 30 -min. RBCs were then lysed and WBCs fixed using a commercial Fix/Lyse solution (eBioscience). Prior to acquisition, 7 AAD (EMD Millipore; DF: 20) was added to stain nuclear DNA. All samples were collected on a Millipore-Amnis FlowSight calibrated each day with manufacturer-provided calibration beads. A minimum of 10, 000 granulocyte (CD 66 b+/CD 45 -) events were acquired using the FlowSight equipped with blue (488 nm; 60 mW) and red (642 nm; 100 mW) lasers.. Side Scatter (SSC) was detected using a dedicated SSC laser (785 nm; 10 mW). Samples were compensated and analyzed post-acquisition using Amnis IDEAS software (v. 6. 0. 208. 0). Results. As a function of incubation time, exercise resulted in a progression suppression of the presence of the “High” activity phenotype. To a lesser extent exercise also affected those granulocytes that were “Moderate” and “Low” active. As recovery progressed, there was a gradual recovery in the “High” active phenotype. Conclusion. To our knowledge the present study is the first to demonstrate that exercise-induced immunosupression can be detected as a function of phenotype shift in granulocytes. More research is needed to identify factors that can prevent post-exercise immunosupression...|$|R
