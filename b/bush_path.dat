The light was failing when he stood outside it looking about him with a curious suggestion of anticipation in his face. They had reached the southern fringe of the Leopards' country, and another week's march should place them in touch with French officials. The forest was comparatively open, the cottonwoods growing well apart; and gazing between the long rows of towering trunks streaked by blue wood smoke, Dane could catch the shimmer of a sluggish creek. It was deep and miry, and haunted, as he had seen, by huge saurians, but a little produce evidently came down that way, for the <b>bush</b> <b>path</b> on either side was connected by a native ferry.|$|E

As I fought him, I bettered some verses in my poem, the WOODMAN; the only thought I gave to letters. Though the kuikui was thick, there was but a small patch of it, and when I was done I attacked the wild lime, and had a hand-to-hand skirmish with its spines and elastic suckers. All this time, close by, in the cleared space of the garden, Lafaele and Mauga were digging. Suddenly quoth Lafaele, 'Somebody he sing out.' - 'Somebody he sing out? All right. I go.' And I went and found they had been whistling and 'singing out' for long, but the fold of the hill and the uncleared bush shuts in the garden so that no one heard, and I was late for dinner, and Fanny's headache was cross; and when the meal was over, we had to cut up a pineapple which was going bad, to make jelly of; and the next time you have a handful of broken blood-blisters, apply pine-apple juice, and you will give me news of it, and I request a specimen of your hand of write five minutes after - the historic moment when I tackled this history.

Then, one fine day during the wee morning hours, Chotte Thakur Sahaab is being shown going to Mussoorie to drop his niece, Jasmin, at her boarding school. When they're crossing the lonely stretch of the forest (Veerana), the car overheats and stops. The uncle asks his little girl to wait in the car for him and leaves to fetch some water for the radiator. However, Baba suddenly creeps out from behind a bush, hypnotises the girl, and by cutting a piece of her frock and few strands of her hair makes a doll from it. He then places the glass bottle holding this doll in the witch's sarcophagus. Jasmin {{gets out of the car}} in the hypnotised state of mind and walks over to the shrine. Meanwhile, the uncle comes back with the water tin and is shocked not to find the child in the car. He follows her trail and is astonished to find himself going off deep inside the forbidden <b>bush</b> <b>path.</b> On the other side, the girl walks inside the devil's lair and comes to a standstill in front of the witch's tomb. In a shocking moment, the witch reaches out and pulls the kid over inside with her. The uncle tries to save his child but is late in opening the sarcophagus. By that time, the witch's evil spirit already manages to enter the girl's body. Thus, the uncle is rendered helpless as being badly outnumbered by Baba's men and is unable to save his little niece. He is shown to be captured and killed.|$|E
40|$|Security (DHS), revisits {{his years}} {{at the helm of}} that {{controversial}} agency and makes the case for why an activist security policy must not be banished from the American political landscape. A substantial academic literature has come into fashion recently to criticise risk-based security planning, claiming that overzealous security measures result from the logic of mitigating risk, which cannot be mitigated, thereby endlessly escalating security efforts. However, Chertoff champions a risk-management approach to security policy that seeks to resist both the hysteria that suffocates free societies and the complacency that ignores real dangers. Chertoff lays out his argument in a methodical and systematic fashion – threat by threat, response by response – producing an easily accessible glimpse into the Junior Bush cabinet, and perhaps into the future of American security politics. Readers may be surprised at how greatly Chertoff diverges from the <b>Bush</b> <b>path.</b> Though he never criticises his patrons directly, Chertoff repeatedly insists that the best security policy is a proactive one that eliminates the sources of enemies ’ grievance. He is not afraid to call for improvements and he offers a refreshingly sober, non-dogmatic defence of some Bushera policies, arguing calmly and sensibly for the lesser-evil instead of calling his critics as poor patriots or levelling some other petty accusation. There is a strangely compelling dualism to Chertoff’s ideas. On the one hand, Homeland Security is...|$|E

40|$|In {{addressing}} the dearth in studies on linguistic/semiotic landscapes in oral-language dominant rural communities, {{we use the}} notion of repurposing to show how people from rural areas of Livingstone and Lusaka in Zambia (South-Central Africa) extend the repertoire of 'signs' to include faded and unscripted signboards, fauna and flora, mounds, dwellings, abandoned structures, skylines, and village and <b>bush</b> <b>paths</b> (with no written names) in narrations of place. We illustrate how they use the system of signage to transcend {{the limitations of the}} material conditions in the rural-scapes by redeploying memory, objects, artifacts and cultural materialities in place to new uses, and for extended meaning potentials. We conclude that focusing on the semiotic ecology in multimodal linguistic/ semiotic landscapes helps to accentuate the multisemiotic and diverse processual characteristics of meaning-making, even in areas that do not have scripted place and street names.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of P. truncatus in Africa has highlighted the inherent weakness of phytosanitary measures against exotic pests. Consideration {{is given to}} the need for phytosanitary measures and how patterns of international trade affect phytosanitary control. To prevent the spread of pests such asP. truncatus, large grain shipments can be subject to stringent pest control procedures. However, a significant proportion of grain movement in Africa, both within countries and across borders, occurs informally by both illicit, commercial movement of multiple truckloads of grain and legally by individuals carrying headloads via <b>bush</b> <b>paths</b> or small parcels on public transport. Attempts to locate and inspect the small lots would be impractical. Some recommendations are given on how the spread of P. truncatus in large-scale international trade can be slowed but otherwise it is accepted that in the long-term the prevention of further spread of P. truncatus in Africa is wholly unrealistic...|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper {{it was suggested}} that the great difference in filarial incidence between males and females in Western Samoa might be due to differences in working and clothing habits, and that the changes in microfilarial blood density, which appear to have occurred during the years between BUXTON'S survey in 1925 and that of 1953 - 54, reflect changes within the village environment. This suggestion arose from the observation that while mosquito infestation in the open coastal villages was slight, it was heavy in inland villages and heavier still along <b>bush</b> <b>paths</b> and in plantation areas. These observations are in con-formity with those of JACKOWSKI and his colleagues (1952) in American Samoa. The present paper gives a general description of the activities of the various age-groups of Samoans and discusses their possible relationship to the epidcmiology of filariasis. The average micro-filarial counts in 20 c. mm. of peripheral blood of the inhabitants of coastal and inland villages are given and compared with one another and with similar figures obtained by BUXTON nearly 30 years previously.
