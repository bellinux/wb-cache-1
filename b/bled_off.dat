In the early 1690s, he staged the three real operas of the Restoration spectacular genre, or the shows usually so designated: Dioclesian (1689–90) by Massinger/Fletcher/Betterton; King Arthur (1690–91) by John Dryden; and The Fairy-Queen (1691–92), adapted from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream by perhaps Elkanah Settle, all of them graced by music by Henry Purcell, and together perhaps a sign of the coming 18th-century vogue for Italian opera. The lavish variety entertainment Dioclesian, adapted by Betterton, with many monsters, dragons, and machines, from [...] Massinger and Fletcher's History of Dioclesian, was very popular throughout the 1690s and {{made a lot of money}} for the United Company.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1690s, London {{had only one}} officially countenanced theatre company, the [...] "United Company", badly managed and with its takings <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> by predatory investors ("adventurers"). To counter the {{draining}} of the company's income, the manager Christopher Rich slashed the salaries and traditional perks of his skilled professional actors, antagonising such popular performers as Thomas Betterton, the tragedienne Elizabeth Barry, and the comedian Anne Bracegirdle. Colley Cibber wrote in his autobiography that {{the owners of the}} United Company, [...] "who had made a monopoly of the stage, and consequently presumed they might impose what conditions they pleased upon their people, did not consider that they were all this while endeavouring to enslave a set of actors whom the public… were inclined to support." [...] Betterton and his colleagues set forth the bad finances of the United Company and the plight of the actors in a [...] "Petition of the Players" [...] submitted to the Lord Chamberlain. This unusual document is signed by nine men and six women, all established professional actors, and details a disreputable jumble of secret investments and [...] "farmed" [...] shares, making the case that owner chicanery rather than any failure of audience interest was {{at the root of the}} company's financial problems. Barely veiled strike threats in the actors' petition were met with an answering lock-out threat from Rich in a [...] "Reply of the Patentees", but the burgeoning conflict was pre-empted by a suspension of all play-acting from December until March 1695 on account of Queen Mary's illness and death. During this interval, a cooperative actors' company took shape under the leadership of Betterton and was granted a Royal [...] "licence to act" [...] on 25 March, to the dismay of Rich, who saw the threat too late.|$|E

50|$|Designed {{and built}} by the English Electric Co., four steam turbine units of high pressure, {{intermediate}} pressure and double-flow low pressure turbine cylinders were coupled to 250 MW generators. The steam flow into the turbine was regulated by the hydraulically controlled steam inlet valves to maintain a generating speed of 3000 RPM. The turbine over-speed protection was by weight eccentric rings on the turbine shaft, set to throw-out at a predetermined RPM and shutting the HP cylinder inlet steam valves. Exhaust flow from the HP turbine cylinders passed to the boiler for reheating (with some having been <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> to feed heaters), returned to the IP cylinder (with some <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> to LP feed heaters) and exhausted from the double-flow LP cylinder under vacuum into underslung water-cooled condensers. Condenser cooling water was delivered from a sub-basement ring main around the turbine house. The turbine/generator assembly was mounted on reinforced concrete pedestals that ran {{along the length of}} the turbine hall.|$|E
50|$|The RM-38 was a Soviet 50 mm light {{infantry}} mortar, {{developed as}} {{a variant of the}} M1938 120 mm mortar. The barrel was clamped at two elevation angles only - 45 and 75 degrees.

50|$|The USAF {{abandoned}} the concept as counter-productive to BVR engagements as the Cobra maneuver leaves the aircraft {{in a state}} of near zero energy, having <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> nearly all of its speed in performing the Pugachev's Cobra maneuver without gaining any compensating altitude in the process.

50|$|Ethylene oxide de-sorber: The aqueous stream {{resulting}} from the above scrubbing process is then sent to the ethylene oxide de-sorber. Here, ethylene oxide is obtained as the overhead product, whereas the bottom product obtained {{is known as the}} ‘glycol bleed’. When ethylene oxide is scrubbed from the recycle gas with an aqueous solution, ethylene glycols (viz. mono-ethylene glycol, di-ethylene glycol and other poly-ethylene glycols) get unavoidably produced. Thus, in-order to prevent them from building up in the system, they are continuously <b>bled</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
50|$|Blown flaps, or jet flaps, are powered {{aerodynamic}} high-lift devices used on {{the wings}} of certain aircraft to improve their low-speed flight characteristics. They use air blown through nozzles to shape the airflow over the rear edge of the wing, directing the flow downward to increase the lift coefficient. There are a variety of methods to achieve this airflow, most of which use jet exhaust or high-pressure air <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> of a jet engine's compressor and then redirected to follow the line of trailing-edge flaps.|$|E

5000|$|He also {{invented the}} idea of the [...] "jet wing", in which air from the {{compressor}} of a jet engine is <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> to large [...] "augmented" [...] vents in the wings to provide lift for VTOL aircraft. A small amount of high-pressure air is blown into a venturi, which in turn sucks a much larger volume of air along with it, thus leading to [...] "thrust augmentation". The concept was used in the Rockwell XFV-12 experimental aircraft, although the market interest in VTOL aircraft was short-lived. He participated in several other patents.|$|E
50|$|Mercury bubblers are avoided where possible, {{due to the}} {{difficulty}} and expense in dealing with mercury spills. In addition, mercury can react with various chemicals, such as ammonia and acetylenes, with potentially hazardous results. In the context of cannula transfer, mercury bubblers may be avoided by pulling (instead of pushing) liquids through the cannula by vacuum. Alternatively, the oil bubbler may be closed off from the inert gas line with a stopcock, allowing inert gas to push the reagent through the cannula. Excess pressure is <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> from a bubbler fitted directly over the receiving vessel.|$|E
5000|$|Cabin {{pressurization}} is {{a process}} in which conditioned air is pumped into the cabin of an aircraft or spacecraft, {{in order to create a}} safe and comfortable environment for passengers and crew flying at high altitudes. For aircraft, this air is usually <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> from the gas turbine engines at the compressor stage, and for spacecraft, it is carried in high-pressure, often cryogenic tanks. The air is cooled, humidified, and mixed with recirculated air if necessary, before it is distributed to the cabin by one or more environmental control systems. [...] The cabin pressure is regulated by the outflow valve.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{municipalities}} {{north of}} San Francisco Bay, including Santa Rosa and Petaluma, {{are served by}} the Sonoma County Water Agency. Their primary water source is the Russian River. However, {{it must be noted}} that the Russian River owes its summer flow in large part to the Eel, which is <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> via a tunnel into Potter Valley (via the Potter Valley Project) and flows to a reservoir near Ukiah, Lake Mendocino. PG&E now owns the rights to this delivery system, as well as the long controversial history. There are many [...] along the Eel who would like their water back.|$|E

50|$|This {{operational}} cycle is {{a modification of}} the traditional expander cycle. In the bleed (or open) cycle, instead of routing heated propellant through the turbine and sending it back to be combusted, {{only a small portion}} of the propellant is heated and used to drive the turbine and is then <b>bled</b> <b>off,</b> being vented overboard without going through the combustion chamber. Bleeding off the turbine exhaust allows for a higher turbopump output by decreasing backpressure and maximizing the pressure drop through the turbine. Compared with a standard expander cycle, this leads to higher engine thrust at the cost of sacrificing some efficiency due to essentially wasting the bled propellant by not combusting it.|$|E
5000|$|On the way home, Hartney and his gunner {{got into}} eleven more skirmishes, {{clearing}} three incidental machine gun jams. In one skirmish, they tailed another German {{and sent him}} down in a smoking plunge to earth for what was officially another [...] "out of control" [...] win. By the time the FE.2d landed, the gunner had run one gun dry; the other was jammed. The plane was a bullet-riddled wreck, trailing torn fabric. Seven bullets stuck in the engine's water jacket <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> its coolant, and the engine [...] "froze", with four of its Rolls-Royce pistons sticking to their cylinder walls. Tattered streamers of fabric torn by bullets trailed from the biplane. Somehow, the crew was uninjured.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic idea}} of the GT 102 was to {{completely}} separate the power turbine from the engine itself, using the latter as a gas generator. The core engine was run hot enough to power itself and nothing more, no power {{was taken from the}} core to drive the tank. Compressed air from the core's compressor, 30% of the overall airflow, was <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> through a pipe to a completely separate two-stage turbine with its own combustion chamber. This avoided the overspeed problems of the original design; when load was removed, simply shutting off the airflow to the turbine would slow it down. This also meant that the core could be run at full speed while the power turbine ran at low speed, providing significantly improved low-speed torque. The only downside to the design was that the power turbine no longer had the huge spinning mass of the GT 101, and thus did not offer any significant flywheel energy storage.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine control}} unit (ECU) {{controls}} the position {{of one or more}} air control valves based on input signals from throttle angle and engine RPM. The vacuum switching valve (VSV) which controls the vacuum supply to the actuator is normally closed and passes vacuum to the actuator when it is energized by the ECU. By energizing the VSV vacuum is passed to the actuator, closing the air control valve. This effectively lengthens the intake manifold run. By de-energizing the VSV, vacuum to the actuator is blocked and trapped vacuum is <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> of the actuator diaphragm. Toyota ACIS is an On/Off system. The valve (or valves in newer models with multiple valves to create more than 2 lengths) is either fully opened or fully closed.An example of early single-valve ACIS programming would be the 3.0L 3VZ-FE engine. The ECU actuates the VSV to close the valve when the throttle position is 60% or greater and engine speed is 3,900 RPM or more.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{coiled tubing}} or wireline, where the wire or tubing {{is always the}} same {{diameter}} allowing for a single unmoving primary barrier (stuffing box or stripper), snubbing uses a pipe, which will have an enlarged collar at the connection between the joints. Therefore, the pressure control system must be able to accommodate this variable diameter. The stripping rams accomplish this. The first stage of lowering a collar through the stripping system is to close the lower rams so as to seal off the mechanism above from wellbore pressure. The space between the rams can then be <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> allowing the upper rams to be opened. The collar can then pass through the opened upper rams. Once the collar is in between the rams, the upper rams are closed and pressure is equalised either side of the lower rams. The lower rams are then safely opened and the collar is lowered through the rams.|$|E
50|$|Caustic, fed to {{the cell}} room flows in a loop that is {{simultaneously}} <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> to storage with a part diluted with deionized water and returned {{to the cell}} line for strengthening within the cells. The caustic exiting the cell line must be monitored for strength, to maintain safe concentrations. Too strong or too weak a solution may damage the membranes. Membrane cells typically produce caustic in the range of 30% to 33% by weight. The feed caustic flow is heated at low electrical loads to control its exit temperature. Higher loads require the caustic to be cooled, to maintain correct exit temperatures. The caustic exiting to storage is pulled from a storage tank and may be diluted for sale to customers who require weak caustic or for use on site. Another stream may be pumped into a multiple effect evaporator set to produce commercial 50% caustic. Rail cars and tanker trucks are loaded at loading stations via pumps.|$|E

50|$|GE took a {{different}} approach with their first high bypass ratio turbofan, the TF39. A unique, very complex design; the T-stage, which supercharges the core stream, is located ahead of the main fan rotor. The T-stage itself comprises an overhung mini-rotor followed {{by a set of}} outlet guide vanes; the main fan rotor is located immediately behind these OGV's. Outboard of the T-stage rotor are the main inlet guide vanes, which only affect the bypass stream. The T-stage rotor extends to about half the main rotor stage annulus and runs in a tip shroud. The main fan stage has a mid-span platform/flow splitter which separates the single-stage outer annulus from the 2-stage inner annulus. These two stages mainly supercharge the 16-stage high-pressure compressor. However, a fair proportion of the air entering the T-stage is <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> into the bypass duct, there being two annular passages leading to the bypass duct. The nominal bypass ratio of 8:1 must refer to the ratio of total bypass mass flow to HP compressor entry mass flow.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{commercial}} aircraft and large military transport airplanes usually use {{what is called}} an auxiliary power unit (APU). It is normally a small gas turbine. Thus, {{one could say that}} using such an APU is using a small gas turbine to start a larger one. Low pressure (...) , high volume air from the compressor section of the APU is <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> through a system of pipes to the engines where it is directed into the starting system. This bleed air is directed into a mechanism to start the engine turning and begin pulling in air. The starter is usually an air turbine type, similar to the cartridge starter, but uses the APU's bleed air instead of the burning gases of the propellant cartridge. Most cart starters can also use APU air to turn them. When the rotating speed of the engine is sufficient to pull in enough air to support combustion, fuel is introduced and ignited. Once the engine ignites and reaches idle speed, the bleed air and ignition systems are shut off.|$|E

50|$|According to the arson investigation, {{the fire}} {{originated}} inside building 74, {{which was a}} sign shop. This building backed up to an entertainment venue and was located on Kansas Street across from the sound stage. A show had just finished at this venue and the crowd was heading south on Front Street, being escorted by the actors from the show. Within minutes, flames were discovered inside the sign shop and security radioed the front gate. The front gate immediately called 911. In the mean time, someone pulled a fire hose from just north of this location (located outside the Rio Bravo Jail building). When {{it was discovered that}} the hose was not long enough, it was dropped and another hose was pulled from the area of Chinese Alley. However, the original hose was not turned off, which <b>bled</b> <b>off</b> the pressure to the second hose. 300 guests and employees were forced to evacuate the park. Tucson Estates Fire Department arrived in less than 10 minutes with one truck and two firemen. However, by this time the fire had progressed too quickly to be suppressed by this basic equipment. A multiple alarm call was put out to dispatch as many fire units as possible. This began the deployment of 100 pieces of equipment and over 200 firefighters from every fire department in the Tucson metro area, including Davis Monthan Air Force Base and the Arizona National Guard.|$|E
