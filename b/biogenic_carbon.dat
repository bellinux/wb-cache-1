By quality we understand a certain stoichiometric ratio of the main <b>biogenic</b> elements (<b>carbon,</b> nitrogen, phosphorus) in the biomass of food.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This study {{investigates the}} {{accuracy}} of the radiocarbon-based calculation of the <b>biogenic</b> <b>carbon</b> fraction for different biogas and biofossil gas mixtures. The focus is on the uncertainty in the 14 C reference values for 100 % <b>biogenic</b> <b>carbon</b> and on the 13 C-based isotope fractionation correction of the measured 14 C values. The separately (AMS) measured CO 2 and CH 4 fractions of 8 different biogas samples showed 14 C values between 102 ‰ and 116 % (pMC). The δ 13 C values of these samples varied between – 6 ‰ and + 31 ‰ for the CO 2 fraction and between – 28 ‰ and – 62 ‰ for the CH 4 fraction. The uncertainty in calculated <b>biogenic</b> <b>carbon</b> fractions due to uncertainty in the 14 C reference values depends on the available information about the origin of the used biogenic materials. It varies between ± 0. 5 % and ± 3. 5 % (absolute) {{depending on the type of}} biogas. A method is proposed to minimize this uncertainty for different groups of biogases. The calculated <b>biogenic</b> <b>carbon</b> fraction deviates up to ± 2. 5 % for biofossil gas mixtures, if the applied isotope fractionation correction is based on the δ 13 C value of the mixed biofossil sample instead of the biogenic δ 13 C value.

In spite of the considerable progress towards the inventory of <b>biogenic</b> <b>carbon</b> in the life cycle assessment (LCA) of bioenergy in policy guidelines, many scientific articles tend to give no consideration to <b>biogenic</b> <b>carbon,</b> due to the neutrality assumption, rather than to employ a complete inventory according to the LCA principles. Meanwhile, the assumption of <b>biogenic</b> <b>carbon</b> neutrality has been previously challenged {{on the basis of}} changes in soil carbon stock due to land use change and carbon storage capacities of long-rotation trees or wood products. Supporting this argument, we investigate three other inventory aspects which strongly affect final results, namely, differences in framing system boundaries (cradle to grave vs. cradle to gate), forms of carbon emissions (carbon dioxide vs. methane), and valuation of <b>biogenic</b> <b>carbon</b> (relative economic values of biomass products vs. biomass residues). Referring to a generic bioenergy system, our analysis is focused on eight scenarios of various carbon flows encompassing biomass decomposition in fields and its alternative utilization as bioenergy feedstocks. These scenarios are applicable to both biomass products and biomass residues, for which the impacts proportionally depend on the chosen allocation criteria between the two. Further, a framework to quantify the performances of the various possible carbon flows on global warming impacts is formulated. The operation of the framework demonstrates that the assumption of <b>biogenic</b> <b>carbon</b> neutrality introduces a bias to the 'true' values based on a complete inventory. This can make the values of global warming impacts substantially higher or lower than the real scores when different system boundaries, forms of carbon emissions, and biomass valuation are taken into account.

40|$|Earth system {{modelling}} {{indicates that}} terrestrial methane cycling {{may have played}} a more prominent role as a feedback on climate during previous hothouse climatic states than in the present day. The influence of terrestrial methane cycling derives from its sensitivity to both temperature and hydrological regime. However, Paleogene methane cycling remains poorly constrained {{due to the lack of}} proxy data. One potential window into relative changes in methane cycling derives from the carbon isotopic compositions (δ 13 C) of hopanoid lipids. Hopanoids, preserved on geological timescales as hopanes, derive from diverse bacteria including methanotrophs. Assimilation of <b>biogenic</b> methane-derived <b>carbon</b> results in hopanoids substantially depleted in δ 13 C, as observed in cold-seep mats and carbonates and in some methane-rich lakes.

The glacial-interglacial contrasts in upwelling on this margin are attributed to reversals in land-ocean thermal contrast, the waxing and waning of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, and consequent responses of the western hemisphere wind fields. This scenario is consistent with three independent lines of evidence: terrestrial paleoclimatic data, general circulation model results, and our marine records. This pattern of glacial-interglacial variability in upwelling off NW Mexico is opposite to that observed in other low-latitude and midlatitude upwelling areas, such as the eastern equatorial Pacific.

40|$|Sorption is a {{key factor}} in {{determining}} the fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the environment. Here, PAH sorption is proposed as the sum of two mechanisms: absorption into a <b>biogenic,</b> organic <b>carbon</b> (OC) fraction and adsorption onto a combustion-derived, black carbon (BC) fraction. To study BC adsorption, a 375 ʻC thermal oxidation method was employed to remove OC and isolate the BC fraction. Test studies showed that nitrogen-containing macromolecules charred during this pretreatment causing a positive bias to the BC measurement. Meanwhile, the oxidation of relatively small BC particles underestimated the total BC content in non-charring samples. Models based on carbon oxidation were then proposed to estimate reasonably the total BC and OC contents of sediment samples. The adsorption of pyrene onto isolated BC particles was then studied by constructing a nonlinear isotherm, which was characterized with a BC-normalized distribution coefficient and a Freundlich exponent. Pyrene sorption to Boston Harbor sediment was then modeled as the sum of OC absorption and BC adsorption using the measured adsorption parameters and literature absorption values.

The first is to quantify {{the environmental impacts of}} the energy production of a small-scale, combined heat and power production plant utilizing different forest biomasses. The second aim is to estimate the change in environmental impacts on district heat production from natural gas when partially replacing it by heat from the combined heat and power plant.

The model simulations suggest that the total <b>biogenic</b> <b>carbon</b> export (particle sinking flux + DOC export) is higher under strong winter convection (e. g., during the early 1990 s) than under weak winter convection (e. g., during the late 1960 s), by ∼ 70 % across the 200 -m isobath and nearly double at 500 m and 1000 m depth. These large variations in total <b>biogenic</b> <b>carbon</b> export are essentially due to the response of DOC export to ocean climate conditions. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the variations in DOC export from the euphotic zone are due {{to the impact of}} the convection regime {{on the development of the}} microbial food web and on the bacterial consumption of DOC in surface waters. Although DOC downward fluxes within the mesopelagic zone (below ∼ 500 m) are largely controlled by physical processes, the effect of convection on microbial dynamics can potentially amplify the year-to-year variations in the transport of DOC to the deep ocean due to convection...|$|E

30|$|Additionally, {{the life}} cycle {{inventories}} for surfactants, whilst the best available, were over 15  years old {{and there were no}} adequate data relating to direct land use change. However, the source of the surfactant (palm kernel, coconut, or fossil resources) directly influences the importance of land use impact categories, especially natural land transformation. Moreover, for compliance with the WRI GHG protocol, ILCD and ISO 14040 / 44, any direct land use change occurring in the previous 20  years should be considered for above and below ground biomass and for soil organic matter (differentiated for peat and mineral soil). Therefore, we took into account the <b>biogenic</b> fraction of <b>carbon</b> dioxide emissions, both the uptake and release. As the cleaning products are short cyclic, the balance of uptake and release is zero. Due the limited availability of adequate data, the results for impact categories relating to direct land use change and its associated GHG emissions were compromised and must be interpreted with caution.|$|R
40|$|For a {{reliable}} simulation {{of the time}} and space dependent CO 2 redistribution between ocean and atmosphere an appropriate time dependent simulation of particle dynamics processes is essential but has not been carried out so far. The major difficulties were the lack of suitable modules for particle dynamics and early diagenesis (in order to close the carbon and nutrient budget) in ocean general circulation models, and the lack of an understanding of biogeochemical processes, such as the partial dissolution of calcareous particles in oversaturated water. The main target of ORFOIS was to fill in this gap in our knowledge and prediction capability infrastructure. This goal has been achieved step by step. At first comprehensive data bases (already existing data) of observations of relevance for the three major types of <b>biogenic</b> particles, organic <b>carbon</b> (POC), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), and biogenic silica (BSi or opal), as well as for refractory particles of terrestrial origin were collated and made publicly available...|$|R
40|$|The Bio-hydro-atmosphere {{interactions}} of Energy, Aerosols, Carbon, H 2 O, Organics & Nitrogen (BEACHON) project seeks {{to understand the}} feedbacks and inter-relationships between hydrology, <b>biogenic</b> emissions, <b>carbon</b> assimilation, aerosol properties, clouds and associated feedbacks within water-limited ecosystems. The Manitou Experimental Forest Observatory (MEFO) was established in 2008 by the National Center for Atmospheric Research to address many of the BEACHON research objectives, and it now provides a fixed field site with significant infrastructure. MEFO is a mountainous, semi-arid ponderosa pine-dominated forest site that is normally dominated by clean continental air but is periodically influenced by anthropogenic sources from Colorado Front Range cities. This article summarizes the past and ongoing research activities at the site, and highlights some of the significant findings that have resulted from these measurements. These activities include - soil property measurements; - hydrological studies; - measurements of high-frequency turbulence parameters; - eddy covariance flux measurements of water, energy, aerosols and carbon dioxide through the canopy; - determination of biogenic and anthropogenic volatile organic compound emissions and their influence on regional atmospheric chemistry; - aerosol number and mass distributions; - chemical speciation of aerosol particles; - characterization of ice and cloud condensation nuclei; - trace gas measurements; and - model simulations using coupled chemistry and meteorology. In addition to various long-term continuous measurements, three focused measurement campaigns with state-of-the-art instrumentation have taken place since the site was established, and two of these studies are the subjects of this special issue: BEACHON-ROCS (Rocky Mountain Organic Carbon Study, 2010) and BEACHON-RoMBAS (Rocky Mountain Biogenic Aerosol Study, 2011) ...|$|R
