40|$|Tree stems {{contract}} and expand as stem water is depleted and replaced. <b>Band</b> <b>dendrometer</b> {{studies suggest that}} such daily changes are small (1 cm diameter), suggesting that significant biases are possible. An exploratory study examined the pattern and magnitude of daily stem changes and whether commercial band-dendrometers were able to reveal them. A method involving multiple precision measurements on eight trees in a Bornean hill dipterocarp forest revealed daily shrinkage and expansion of girth of around 1 mm. Fluctuations were greater in bright weather. Band-dendrometers detected these changes but revealed less than a tenth of their magnitude. An analytical model for dendrometer error is presented that predicts how measurement biases can be reduced. Tropical trees can fluctuate appreciably in stem diameter over the day. These reversible changes are of sufficient magnitude to merit concern in growth studies. Influential biases seem especially likely when measurement intervals are short and involve systematic differences in timing and weather. Further study is required to gauge the more general influence of these measurement problems...|$|E

40|$|Dendrometer {{measurements}} provide {{time series}} {{composed of the}} rhythm of water storage fluctuations over the year and seasonal tree growth. For slow-growing trees, however, difficulties {{have been found in}} the identification of crucial events such as growth onset, stem growth period and cessation, rendering it necessary to define what can be measured and at which time scale. Time scale means the time interval (from one day to one month) at which stem radius variation is extracted. In this study, two conifer species were monitored by an automatic <b>band</b> <b>dendrometer</b> to assess several time scales and analysis approaches. Data were collected from 8 trees of Picea abies (L.) Karst and Larix decidua L., growing at 1020 and 2080 m a. s. l. in the eastern Italian Alps, from 2000 to 2003. Time series of stem radius variation were extracted with different approaches, such as the stem cycle, daily mean and daily maximum. Several approaches can be used, as very similar time series of stem radius variations were produced with high coefficients of correlation among the series. At lower altitude, the approximate onset was identified at the beginning of May with a 10 -day time scale, when the distribution of stem radius variation differed from zero. The main growth period, from May to June-July, corresponded mainly with earlywood cell formation. At higher altitude, a time scale of at least 15 days facilitated identification of the main period of stem growth only, corresponding with earlywood cell formation. Even if latewood cells were produced in August at both altitudes, the variability in stem radius changes was higher than the amount of growth in terms of cell-wood production. For a slow-growing species in a cold environment, an understanding of the growth period, assessed with several time scales, is necessary when using time series of stem radius variation to assess growth and climate relationships. The period used for growth and climate analysis should correspond only with the main period of stem growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of tree rings {{is a slow}} and complex process. The year-to-year climatic variability and the constant interaction between {{the internal and external}} factors controlling cambial activity create the conditions that make each tree ring unique. In order to capture the dynamics of cambial activity and wood formation during the growing season, it is necessary to monitor wood development in narrower time intervals (from minutes to weeks). Most of the studies performed on cambial activity and wood formation were held in cold environments, however, in other environments, such as drought-prone areas, it still remains poorly understood. In order to understand cambial activity and wood formation in a drought-prone environment, timings and dynamics of cambial activity were monitored in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) growing in the Mediterranean region for two years (2010 and 2011). Anatomical observations of the cambial zone and differentiating xylem were made and stem radial increment monitored using manual and automatic dendrometers. The studies described in this thesis were carried out in Perimetro Florestal Dunas de Cantanhede, a managed plantation of maritime pine located in the west coast of Portugal. The cambial activity and wood {{formation of}} maritime pine trees with the same age and size but different growth rates in the period 2009 - 1994 (classified as fast and slow trees), were monitored throughout 2010, to determine whether the observed differences in tree-ring width were triggered by timings of cambial activity or by rates of cell production. Anatomical observations of the cambium and developing xylem determined that the timing of cambial activity was similar in both growth rate classes. However, fast-growing trees presented higher rates of cell production than slow-growing trees. The <b>band</b> <b>dendrometer</b> readings revealed a bimodal pattern of stem radial increment, with two peaks of increment, one more pronounced in spring and another in autumn. Although the bimodal pattern is typical of trees growing in the Mediterranean region, the combined analysis of anatomical observations and band dendrometers showed that the second period of radial increment corresponded mostly to the re-hydration of the stem, since no resumption of cambial activity was observed in autumn. In order to determine if differences in stem diameter were due to different rates of cell production or xylogenesis timings, the cambial activity of even-aged trees belonging to two diameter classes was monitored throughout 2011. The timings of cambial onset and differentiation were the same in both diameter classes. However, enlargement and cell wall deposition lasted longer in large trees. Besides the different durations, large trees also showed a higher rate of cell production. Thus, revealing that the differences in diameter observed between the trees were due to the rates of cell production. In both diameter classes, the cambium was active from March to July, and quiescent from August to November, suggesting that in the Mediterranean region trees are under a double climatic control: low temperatures and reduced photoperiod in the winter and high temperatures associated with low water availability in the summer. Summer quiescence was broken in late October, when precipitation re-hydrated the stem. In November, cambial divisions were observed, indicating that maritime pine has the ability to form new xylem cells after the summer drought. The influence of climate on the cambial activity and wood formation of maritime pine was studied over two dry years (2010 and 2011). It was found that cambial onset started earlier in response to a warmer late-winter and stopped earlier in response to a drier spring and summer, confirming that Mediterranean conifers are under a double climatic control. Low water availability during spring and summer limited cell production, which affected tree-ring width. Drier conditions also triggered an earlier start of latewood formation, leading to the development of fewer tracheids with smaller lumen area. It was also observed that the duration of xylogenesis was not dependent on cambial onset. In fact, an earlier onset of xylogenesis did not trigger a longer duration of cambial activity. To ascertain the influence of water availability on the stem radial increment of maritime pine, hourly variations of stem radial increment and tree water deficit were monitored throughout 2010 using automatic dendrometers. The seasonal cycle was divided in five periods of distinct physiological activity: winter dormancy, spring growth, pre-summer contraction, summer quiescence and autumn re-hydration. The stem cycle approach was then used to divide the daily cycles in contraction, recovery and increment phases. Continuous positive radial increment started in spring and reached its maximum by the end of June, time at which a shrinking period was observed. The stem contraction observed in June was due to the inability of trees to recover the water lost by transpiration, contracting from one cycle to the next. In autumn, a period of re-hydration and rapid expansion was observed after precipitation. Daily variations in stem radius of maritime pine were mainly determined by the course of transpiration and thus, highly dependent on temperature and water availability. Overall, the results obtained in this dissertation provided a detailed insight on the dynamics of maritime pine cambial activity in a drought-prone environment, the Mediterranean region. It was observed that cell production rate was the main responsible for the differences in tree-ring width and ultimately in stem diameter. Within an even-aged and managed forest, different individuals can present different cellular production rates (fast and slow trees) that in time will be translated in different stem diameters (larger and smaller trees). Growth onset was not influenced by tree size, but a longer duration of wood formation was observed in fast-growing and larger trees. In both years (2010 and 2011), the radial increment of all studied trees presented a clear bimodal pattern, with two increment peaks, as observed in other Mediterranean species. The first and more pronounced peak occurred in spring and a second less pronounced peak in autumn. The second growth peak corresponded mainly to a re-hydration of the stem after the summer drought, since the anatomy study did not reveal the formation or differentiation of new xylem cells. Climate {{played an important role in}} maritime pine cambial activity and wood formation, low temperatures and reduced photoperiod in winter and high temperatures associated with low water availability in the summer limited tree growth by imposing a dormant period...|$|E

We took measurements of circumference to the nearest 0.1 mm approximately every month for 12 years at Buffer Preserve (Sep 2004 to Jun 2016) and for 2.5 years at Avon Park (Jan 2006 to Jul 2008).

The daily circumferential activity of four trees at each of two sites, a riparian and an upland site, was recorded {{during the growing season}} of 1996, a year with an extreme spring flood. First cambium cell divisions occurred near June 9, followed by a distinct and sustained upward trend in the stem basal area until mid-July that reflected the earlywood formation. The strongly synchronous circumferential activity at both sites suggests no adverse flooding effect on growth of the riparian trees, which is explained by the rapid retreat of the water just before growth initiation in early June. The following month until mid-August was characterized by strong short-term fluctuations caused by alternating drought and rain periods and a slight downward trend of the basal area for six of the eight <b>banded</b> white-cedars. The <b>dendrometers</b> of two trees, the closest to the lake, showed a slight upward trend probably reflecting latewood formation. Pearson correlation with meteorological data indicated that precipitation was positively related to the daily changes in basal area of all trees except during the period of earlywood formation, which probably resulted from the high soil moisture after spring snow-melting. Mean and minimum air humidity were positively related and maximum temperature negatively related to the daily variations in stem circumference during the whole monitoring period, emphasizing the importance of the internal water status on stem size...|$|R
40|$|Summary The {{progress}} of xylem formation in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) was measured during one growing season in southern Finland. Stem radius was monitored continuously with <b>band</b> <b>dendrometers,</b> {{and the formation}} of new tracheids was determined by examination of small increment cores taken twice weekly. Tracheid production started in June and ceased in August. Xylem formation was fastest in early July, when 0. 75 – 1. 25 new tracheids were formed per day. The rate of xylem formation was significantly correlated with mean daily temperature. Synchronous fluctuations in tracheid and lumen diameters were observed at the same relative positions within each annual ring, but no relationship existed between the diameters and weather variables. The timing of changes in stem radius differed from the timing of actual xylem formation. Stem radius increased in April and May, and the fastest daily increments were recorded in June. Increases in stem radius slowed in July, but small increases were measured more than a month after xylem formation had ceased. Daily changes in stem radius were correlated with daily precipitation, reflecting changes in stem water content. Therefore, dendrometers are of dubious value for measuring the timing of actual xylem formation. Small increment cores proved to be useful in assessing actual xylem formation, but the method is laborious. ...|$|R

Annual and seasonal growths of stands basal area, {{as well as}} the relative importance of main climatic factors for wood production have been studied. The seasonal variation of stands basal area increment follows the climatic rhythm; however the rainfall deficit in August (short dry season) does not lead to a decrease in cambial activity. Variations of annual basal area increment are high. Monthly amount of rainfall is not the only climatic factor determining basal area growth rates. The rains' distribution and the evaporation rate are determinant, especially for extreme values. High growth rates are more closely related to widely distributed rainfall, rather than to heavy precipitation, while trunk shrinkage occurs when evaporation rate is high. Moreover, climatic conditions and water deficit of previous months are also determining. Annual losses due to mortality are very irregular as they are related to dead trees size.

Climatic conditions of the study site are characterised with warm and wet summers and cold-dry winters. In 5 years average around 61 % of the annual precipitation falls during growing season. There was highly significant correlation between relative increment and temperature (p= 2. 324 e- 13) and significant correlation between relative increment and precipitation (p= 0. 0439). The performed results confirmed that inter-tree competition and diameter at breast height are sufficient variables for circumference increment estimation of unmeasured trees in the particular year.

The present investigation brings important results about tree growth and seasonal growth dynamics and its relation with competition and microclimatic conditions in mature spruce stand. It is obvious that unsuitable climatic conditions for spruce can lead to stem shrinkage during growing season. Here we assume that these responses are caused mostly by water storage deficit in stem and this leads to decreasing of the tree vitality. Such phenomenon will have significantly negative ecological and economic consequences in expected climatic changes in the future...|$|R

Despite the {{recent advances in}} cambial biology, the exogenous and endogenous factors generating asynchronous xylem growths still remain undetermined. This study investigated timings and duration of xylem formation in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) from an even-aged plantation in Portugal growing under Mediterranean climate. Cambial phenology and stem diameter were monitored weekly, from March to December 2010, on two classes of trees divided according to the tree ring widths of the last 15 years, but similar age and size: fast- and slow-growing trees. We tested the hypothesis that differences in tree ring widths result from cell production which in turn affects timings of xylogenesis and that the bimodal growth pattern, typical of the Mediterranean, originates from a double reactivation of the cambium: in spring and autumn. Cambial activity started earlier and ended later in fast-growing trees, confirming that cell production is a key factor determining the duration of xylogenesis. Intra-annual variations in stem diameter recorded by <b>band</b> <b>dendrometers</b> revealed two peaks of increment occurring in spring and late summer. However, the number of cambial cells did not increase in late summer, which suggested that the second peak of increment was caused by stem rehydration, rather than by a reactivation of cell division.

The {{results showed that the}} stem radius variation of Larix principis-rupprechtii has a clear diurnal pattern which can be divided into contraction, recovery, and increment phases; and also a seasonal pattern which can be divided into three stages: (1) the rapid growth stage in spring (stage 1) with the radius increment of 94. 0 % of the total in the entire growing period; (2) the persistent shrinkage stage in the dry summer (stage 2) with a negative diurnal radius increment for most days, and a significantly larger amplitude of stem contraction and recovery than other stages; (3) the minimal growth stage in autumn (stage 3), mainly caused by the lowering temperature and leaf area. The amplitude of stem contraction was significantly correlated with air temperature (both the mean and highest value) in all three stages: vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in stage 1; relative humidity (RH), VPD and soil moisture (Ms) in stage 2; and soil temperature (Ts) in stage 3. This indicates that the stem radius contraction was mainly controlled by the factors influencing tree transpiration rate in spring and autumn stages, but jointly controlled by the factors influencing both the tree transpiration rate and the soil moisture availability in the dry summer stage. The factors controlling the stem radius recovery was similar to the stem contraction. The amplitude of stem increment was significantly correlated with the rainfall amount and air temperature (both the mean and highest value) in stage 1 and 3, Ms in stage 2, and the lowest air temperature and Ts in stage 3.

In coastal Labrador, radial growth was initiated during the last week of June 2014, and ceased by August 25 th. Circumference <b>band</b> <b>dendrometers</b> were installed on white spruce trees at both the Nain and Kamestastin sites. The dendrometers were used to measure micrometre-scale changes over the 2014 growing season. Analogous records of temperature were collected with equal temporal resolution, from an Environment Canada climate station (# 8502800), and via a programmable data logger (UX 120 - 006 M, Onset HOBO). Correlation function analysis determined the relationship between daily temperature variables and daily variations in stem size. A strong relationship was found between minimum daily temperature and daily stem size at both sites over the eight week long growing season. Traditional dendrochronological sampling methods were utilized to retrieve tree cores from white spruce and eastern larch (Larix laricina) in Nain and Kamestastin. Site-specific master growth chronologies were created using crossdating and standardization techniques. After establishing long term records of monthly temperature and accumulated growing degree-days (GDD) at both study sites, a linear regression analysis was undertaken to determine the suitability of these two variables as predictors of annual-radial growth. An accumulated June/July GDD index was identified as an overall better predictor of annual ring-width than mean monthly temperature variables in northern Labrador. Exploring radial growth on an intra-annual scale helped to improve our understanding of the complex radial growth-climate relationship in Labrador. This allows for a strengthening of tree rings as a proxy climate indicator in remote regions of the northern boreal forest.

An analysis of xylem sap flow showed that physiological responses were independent of species, which allowed me to construct a general model of weather driven sap flow rates. This model predicted more than eighty percent of climate driven sap flow variation. Leaf phenology influenced growth in three of the ten species, with two of these species showing a link between leaf phenology and weather. A combination of rainfall, air temperature, and irradiance likely provided the cues that triggered leaf drop in Dipteryx panamensis and Lecythis ampla. Combining the results of the sap flow model, growth, and the climate measures showed tree growth was correlated to climate, though the majority of growth variation remained unexplained. Low variance in the environmental variables and growth rates likely contributed to the large amount of unexplained variation. A simple model that included previous growth increment and three meteorological variables explained from four to nearly fifty percent of the growth variation. Significant growth carryover existed in six of the ten species, and rainfall was positively correlated to growth in eight of the ten species. Minimum nighttime temperature was also correlated to higher growth rates in five of the species and irradiance in two species. These results indicate that tropical rainforest tree trunks could act as carbon sinks if future climate becomes wetter and slightly warmer. ...|$|R

40|$|The work {{deals with}} {{measurement}} techniques of water conducting {{system in the}} trees. Water conducting system (including xylem and phloem) indicates its importance for related physiological processes. There are still problems how to measure its functioning (which variables and how), especially in the open field (e. g., forests and orchards) {{in order to get}} maximum information about it. Simple <b>band</b> <b>dendrometers</b> measuring seasonal dynamics of stem growth have been already applied for many years, being gradually replaced by their more sophisticated electronic versions most recently. The sap flow is a suitable variable, because it links roots and crowns and provide information about transporting the largest amount of mass in plants, which can be decisive for their behavior. Following pioneering work in the last century (Huber, 1932), many types of sap flow measurement methods based on a variety of principles (e. g., thermodynamic, electric, magneto-hydrodynamic, nuclear magnetic resonance, etc.) have been described. Only a few of these, particularly those based on thermodynamics, have been widely used in field-grown trees. E. g., heat pulse velocity system developed by Green (1998) and Cohen et al. (1981). Heat ratio method also works with pulses, but interpreted the data in more sophisticated way (Burgess, 2001). Widely used is a simple heat-dissipation method (Granier, 1985). Direct electric heating and internal sensing of temperature was applied in the trunk heat balance method (Čermák et al., 1973, 1976, 1982, 2004; Kučera et al., 1977; Tatarinov et al., 2005). The heat field deformation method is based on measurement of the deformation of the heat field around a needle-like linear heater (Nadezhdina et al., 1998, 2002, 2006; Čermák et al., 2004). Another important variable is water potential, which could be measured in the past only periodically on selected pieces of plant material using pressure (Scholander) bomb, but most recently also continuous measurements became possible due to application of psychrometric method (Dixon and Tyree, 1985). There exist also other physical variables carrying important information, which can be measured using different principles. This includes e. g., acoustic methods, which can detect quantitative variation of pulses occurring during cavitation events, associated with interruptions of water columns in vessels. This must not necessarily be a single source of acoustic emissions. In this study we are focused on a general description of acoustic events measurable {{in a wide range of}} their spectrum. The first aim was to detect such signals and the second to learn them and gradually analyze in order to better understand the associated processes causing their occurrence and their relations to plant life...|$|R

40|$|Tropical {{forests are}} storehouses of more thanhalf of the world‘s {{biodiversity}} {{and play a}} key role in global carbon, water and energy cycles. However, as a consequence of rapid anthropogenic climate change, biodiversity and climate functions of these forests are under a threat. Climate is changing not only in mean state but its variability is increasing, with extreme events such as droughts, heat waves and storms also rising. Water is fundamental to plants‘ existence, and in the tropics, is a key determinant of plant species‘richness, composition, growth and survival. There is thus an increasing interest in understanding how changing rainfall may cause functional changes in forests or change their species composition. Therefore, the overarching goal of thisdissertation was to understand the impact of water variability on tropical forest tree growth and vulnerability to drought. Forest tree growth along spatial and temporal rainfall gradientsObservational studies that measure whole forest tree growth along spatial or temporal gradients of rainfall are the most common way of formulating forest growth response curves to water availability, when manipulative experiments are cost-prohibitive or impractical (fire or large mammal disturbance). In the tropics, since very few species show anatomically distinct tree rings, estimating tree growth from trunk diameter is the standard practice to obtain growth patterns across species. However, this method—of equating woody growth to diameter change [...] is susceptible to bias from water-induced stem flexing. In the absence of bias correction, temporal variability in growth is likely to be overestimated and incorrectly attributed to fluctuations in resource availability, especially in forests with high seasonal and inter-annual variability in water. This problem has been largely ignored in the absence of any corrective measure and due to under-appreciation of the magnitude of error. While diameter re-censuses in permanent sampling plots (PSPs) have been most commonly done at 3 - 5 year scale (using a graduate tape), increasingly they are done at seasonal and annual scales (using <b>band</b> <b>dendrometers)</b> to closely match variation in rainfall, the scales at which hydrostatic bias may be greater in magnitude relative to woody growth. Besides, along a spatial rainfall gradient, inter-annual variability in water may vary, causing systematic differences in the hydrostatic bias for forests along the gradient. Therefore, one broad objective of this thesis was to evaluate the problem of hydrostatic bias in whole forest growth-rainfall relationship at annual and supra-annual scales, for temporal as well as spatial rainfall gradients and propose and test a novel corrective solution. Further, it also examines if growth-diameter relationship vary along the spatial gradient, which it may arise due to differences in light environments and/or disturbance history and species composition. The missing link of Eco-hydrology Differential responses of tree species in terms of growth and survival to variation in water that they can access, the proximate cause is likely shaped through their life-history strategies, the ultimate cause. However, we neither know the depths at which the diverse tree species in a forest draw water from and its dynamics, nor variation in water at those depths vis-à-vis rainfall patterns—for lack of appropriate methods. This has been a key missing link in understanding how water shapes trees‘ life-history strategies, their demographic trade-offs and co-existence, and also our predictive ability to determine species-specific responses to changing rainfall patterns, especially droughts. Since droughts are highly stochastic events and trees‘ responses to their drought ―experiences‖ may be revealed at decadal scales, long-term evaluations are key. Therefore, the second broad objective of this thesis was to develop a framework to determine trees’ water uptake depths, variation in water availability at those depths and trees’ demographic responses over multiple decades. From this, to understand how belowground hydrology shapes drought-vulnerability, demographic trade-offs and coexistence of forest tree species. This thesis titled—Eco-Hydrology of a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest: Tree Growth, Belowground Water Dynamics and Drought-Vulnerability—is organized as follows: Chapter 1 lays down an introduction to the thesis, followed by a description of the study site and datasets used in the thesis in Chapter 2. This thesis uses a variety of methods and multiple datasets, all of which are from the protected Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests of the Western Ghats in southern India in the Mudumalai and Bandipur National Parks. It is then followed by three data chapters: Chapter 3 describes the seasonal fluctuations in a five year long (1980 - 1985) tree diameter time series (using dendrometers) of a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest in Bandipur National Park to illustrate the issue of hydrostatic stem-flexing. It investigates the possibility that <b>band</b> <b>dendrometers</b> may themselves underestimate stem shrinkage at diurnal or seasonal scale. It also evaluates if there could be a best season and time of the day for undertaking forest diameter censuses that can minimize hydrostatic bias. Chapter 4 (published in Forest Ecology and Management) measures the hydrostatic bias in a sample of trees in a 50 ha PSP of a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest in Mudumalai National Park, and proposes a novel way to correct this bias at the whole community level in the 20 year long 4 -year interval growth time series. Chapter 5 (in review with Environmental Research Letters) investigates and presents two new confounding factors in growth-rainfall relationships along a spatial rainfall gradient: hydrostatic bias and size-dependency in growth rates. For this it evaluates forest tree growth estimates in seven 1 -ha PSPs (~ 800 trees, 3 -year annual time series 9 using dendrometers) along a 1000 mm rainfall gradient spanning a mesic savanna-moist forest transition in Mudumalai National Park. Using the period for which seasonal diameter time series was available (2 yrs), it evaluates if the extent of seasonal fluctuations systematically vary along the gradient—most likely due to hydrostatic stem flexing. It also describes the presence of an anomalous size-diameter relationship in the mesic savanna from a large plots (50 ha PSP, diameter records using graduated tape). These observations are then used to draw insights for ―space for time‖ substitution modeling. Chapter 6 (in prep for Nature Plants) analyses belowground water environments of trees over two decades (1992 - 2012), a period that includes a prolonged and intense drought, in the 50 ha PSP of a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest in Mudumalai. It uses a locally parametarised dynamic hydrological model in which site rainfall is also a forcing variable. It then develops a novel dynamic growth model and inversely estimates water uptake depths for adult trees of all common species (include ~ 9000 trees) in the PSP from their above-ground growth patterns over two decades vis-à-vis belowground water availability at multiple depths. It then examines if species‘ water uptake depth obtained thus is a predictor of their drought-driven mortality. Finally, this is used to evaluate the hydrological niche partitioning tree species operate under and how that drives their water uptake strategies, demographic trade-offs, and drought-vulnerability.

Band-dendrometer {{studies suggest that}} such daily changes are small ( 1 cm diameter), suggesting that significant biases are possible. An exploratory study examined the pattern and magnitude of daily stem changes and whether commercial band-dendrometers were able to reveal them. A method involving multiple precision measurements on eight trees in a Bornean hill dipterocarp forest revealed daily shrinkage and expansion of girth of around 1 mm. Fluctuations were greater in bright weather. Band-dendrometers detected these changes but revealed less than a tenth of their magnitude. An analytical model for dendrometer error is presented that predicts how measurement biases can be reduced. Tropical trees can fluctuate appreciably in stem diameter over the day. These reversible changes are of sufficient magnitude to merit concern in growth studies. Influential biases seem especially likely when measurement intervals are short and in-volve systematic differences in timing and weather.

As a result of these observations, it was concluded that most study trees formed one growth ring per year. This suggests that tree species from the seasonal semi-deciduous forests of Brazil have an annual cycle of wood formation. Therefore, these trees have potential for use in future studies of tree age and radial growth rates, as well as to infer ecological and regional climatic conditions.

40|$|Abstract Life-history traits {{interact}} in important ways. Relatively few studies, however, have explored the rela-tionships between life-history traits in long-lived taxa such as trees. We examined patterns of energy allocation to compo-nents of reproduction and growth in three species of Cali-fornia oaks (Quercus spp.) {{using a combination}} of annual acorn censuses, <b>dendrometer</b> <b>bands</b> to measure radial incre-ment, and litterfall traps. Our results are generally consistent with the hypothesis that energy invested in reproduction detracts from the amount of energy available for growth in these long-lived taxa; i. e., there are trade-offs between these traits. The relationships between reproduction and growth varied substantially among specific trait combinations and tree species, however, and in some cases were in the direction opposite that expected based on the assumption of trade-offs between them. This latter finding appears to be a consequence of the pattern of resource use across years in these long-lived trees contrasting with the expected partitioning of resource use within years in short-lived taxa. Thus, the existence and magnitude of putative trade-offs varied depending on whe-ther the time scale considered was within or across years. Collectively, our results indicate that negative relationships between fundamental life-history traits can be important at multiple levels of modular organization and that energy invested in reproduction can have measurable consequences in terms of the amount of energy available for future repro-duction and both current and future growth...|$|R

Climatic variables for the monitoring period were obtained and grouped every 14 days. The effect of the climate variables was determined by maximum and minimum growth periods in assessing trunk growth. These growth periods were related with precipitation, average temperature and relative air humidity. The re-scaled wood density values, calculated using the radial growth of the tree trunks measured accurately with steel dendrometers, enabled the determination of the relationship of small changes in wood density and the effect of the climatic variations and growth rate of eucalyptus tree trunks.
