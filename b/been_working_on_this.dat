5|$|The non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised {{explanatory}} treatise {{may have}} been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the seconda pratica was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit the issue. On the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the seconda practica, in a treatise entitled Melodia; he may still have <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> {{at the time of his}} death ten years later.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} jazz in Cuba was hidden {{for many years}} by the unwillingness of record {{companies}} to make recordings available. However, in recent years, {{it has become clear}} that its history in Cuba is as long as its history in the USA. The key figure in revealing the early days of Cuban jazz is Leonardo Acosta, musician and musicologist, who has <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> topic for many years. Others have explored the history of jazz and Latin jazz from the U.S. perspective. The pre-history of Cuban jazz includes musicians like Louis Moreau Gottschalk and W.C. Handy, who visited Cuba and brought creole ideas into their music.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Schulz {{tried to}} have Li'l Folks {{syndicated}} through the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a firm run by the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain. Schulz {{would have been an}} independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but the deal fell through. Li'l Folks was dropped in early 1950. Later that year, Schulz approached the United Feature Syndicate - also operated by Scripps-Howard - with his best work from Li'l Folks. When his work was picked up by United Feature Syndicate, they decided to run the new comic strip he had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on.</b> <b>This</b> strip was similar in spirit to the panel comic, but it had a set cast of characters, rather than different nameless little folk for each page. The name Li'l Folks was too close to the names of two other comics of the time: Al Capp's Li'l Abner and a strip titled Little Folks. To avoid confusion, the syndicate settled on the name Peanuts, after the peanut gallery featured in the Howdy Doody TV show.|$|E

It was noticeably more academic in tone than any of its predecessors, a book for the scholar rather than the cook. Reviewing the work, Candice Rodd wrote: ...|$|E

[...] Gore was challenged on this topic by Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who asked him: [...] "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something {{that you are going to}} personally benefit from?” Gore responded by stating: [...] "I believe that the transition to a green economy is good for our economy and good for all of us, and I have invested in it." [...] Gore also added that all earnings from his investments have gone to the Alliance for Climate Protection and that [...] "If you believe that the reason I have <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don’t know me." [...] Finally, Gore told Blackburn: [...] "Do you think there is something wrong with being active in business in this country [...] I am proud of it. I am proud of it." ...|$|E

I unscrewed the long mouth-piece, and gently withdrew from it the little membrane-covered cylinder, not six inches in length, which formed the soul of my invention. I took it in my hand and gazed upon it. Through its thin, flexible, and almost transparent outer envelope I could see, as I held it to the light, its framework, fine as the thread-like bones of a fish, its elastic chords, its quivering diaphragms, and all the delicate organs of its inner life. It seemed as if I could feel the palpitations of its heart as I breathed upon it. For how many days and months had I <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> subtle invention--working, and thinking, and dreaming!
