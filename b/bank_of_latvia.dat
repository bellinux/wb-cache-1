40|$|The Latvian {{experience}} {{shows that}} the central bank's successful monetary policy, together with the government's prudent policies, helps to reduce inflation. Due to Latvia's small size and high degree of openness of its economy, the exchange rate {{plays a significant role}} in determining inflation in the country. The <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Latvia's</b> interim objective - the stability of the exchange rate - has been the key to achieving and maintaining price stability. In {{light of the fact that}} many factors that determine inflation in Latvia are beyond the central bank's control, the pursuit of a strategy based on inflation targeting appears to be difficult. monetary policy, inflation, Phillips curve...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to explore the role <b>of</b> the <b>banking</b> sector in {{transmission}} <b>of</b> the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Latvia's</b> monetary policy and to check the existence <b>of</b> the <b>bank</b> lending channel in Latvia. For empirical investigation <b>of</b> the <b>bank</b> lending channel in Latvia, we use the approach that builds on the standard panel regression. The evidence on the bank lending channel is obtained by estimating a bank loan function that takes into account not only the monetary policy indicator and macroeconomic variables, but also bank-specific differences in the lending reaction to monetary policy actions. Empirical analysis shows that some banks in Latvia have statistically significant negative reaction to a domestic monetary shock; however, the weighted average reaction of the total lats loan growth is not statistically significant. A domestic monetary shock has only a distribution effect and affects banks that are small, domestically owned and have lower liquidity or capitalisation. The bank lending channel is limited only for the supply of lats loans, which dramatically reduces the importance of this channel. monetary policy transmission, bank lending channel...|$|R
40|$|The current {{research}} continues {{the series of}} studies aimed to analyze the issues in regards to bank efficiency in the Baltic banking market. The goal of the current paper is to empirically test the Quiet Life Hypothesis (QLH) and to investigate the relationship between market concentration and efficiency in the <b>banking</b> sector <b>of</b> <b>Latvia,</b> Lithuania and Estonia. Two QLH-related hypotheses are stated for the research purposes. To achieve the established goal, the authors run a multiple regression analysis, using efficiency <b>of</b> an individual <b>bank</b> as a dependent variable. In turn, independent variables include market concentration proxied by Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and bank-specific measures, such as market share, profitability and productivity. Efficiency scores for individual banks were estimated applying Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Study {{is based on the}} sample data <b>of</b> 33 <b>banks</b> operating in the Baltic countries, covering the period of 2007 - 2013 (227 observations). Data processing was made with application of DEAFrontier and SPSS software. In the result of the performed analysis the stated hypotheses are rejected. Thus, there is no empirical evidence that market power, and consequently, market concentration in the Baltic banking sector negatively impacts the efficiency <b>of</b> individual <b>banks...</b>|$|R
