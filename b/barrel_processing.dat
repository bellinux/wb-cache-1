Subject to the requirements of consumers and customer complaints about the existing products, the company developed the new AK-12 assault rifle, which will {{serve as the basis for}} a range of various new products for military and civil purposes. Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense have already shown great interest in this machine. By seriously improving the assault rifle’s ergonomic features, by improving the quality of <b>barrel</b> <b>processing</b> using foreign equipment, implementing plastics in the production, “Izhmash” plans to make the AK-12 into a universal platform, which can be used for the production of both common assault rifles for widespread use, and sophisticated systems, specially attuned to meet the specific needs of special forces. In addition, a new tactical sniper rifle was developed to replace the SV-98. In the class of semi-automatic sniper rifles, the company plans to release a new Dragunov rifle, which will have the best characteristics in its class by 2013, and to put it into service by 2014.|$|E
40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody (mAb) product development {{case study is}} presented {{to address some of}} the issues faced during developing a pre-filled syringe (PFS) product for a biotherapeutic. In particular, issues involving incompatibility with silicone oil and a stability-based approach for selection of PFS barrel and tip cap components have been discussed. Silicone spiking studies followed by exposure to agitation stress or accelerated temperature conditions were used to check for incompatibilities of the mAb with silicone oil, a necessary product contact material in PFS. In addition, screening studies to compare various closure materials as well as syringe <b>barrel</b> <b>processing</b> methods were used to select the optimum closure materials as well as the correct syringe processing method. Results indicate that the model mAb formulation used was sensitive to high levels of silicone oil especially under accelerated temperature conditions resulting in formation of protein–silicone particles in the solution for samples that were spiked with the silicone oil. Agitation stress did not have any significant impact on the quality attributes tested. Samples stored in syringe barrels that were processed with sprayed-on silicone had higher levels of subvisible particles as compared to those that were processed with the baked-on process. The tip cap comparability study resulted in one tip cap material having superior compatibility among the three that were tested. The quality attribute that was most impacted by the tip cap materials was mAb oxidation. An approach for evaluation of primary packaging components during the development of pre-filled syringe presentations for biotechnology-based compounds has been highlighted...|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 224 pigs (PIC TR 4 × 1050, {{initially}} 18. 7 lb avg BW) {{were used in}} a 21 -d experiment {{to determine the effects}} of extrusion processing on the nutritional value of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) in diets for nursery pigs. The pigs were weaned at 21 d of age, sorted by sex and ancestry, and blocked by BW. All pigs were fed a common diet for 11 d postweaning and the experimental treatments for the next 21 d. Treatments were a corn-soybean meal-based control and 3 diets formulated with 30 % DDGS. The 3 DDGS treatments were either (1) not treated, (2) dry-extruded with the <b>barrel</b> configured for <b>processing</b> cereal grain (to generate less shear and temperature rise), or (3) dry-extruded with the <b>barrel</b> configured for <b>processing</b> soybeans (to generate more shear and temperature rise). Overall, ADG and ADFI both improved (P 0. 11) but did reduce ADFI (P 0. 20). Pigs fed the corn-soy control diet had greater digestibility of DM, N, and GE (P < 0. 02) compared to pigs fed the diets with DDGS. Among the DDGS treatments, extrusion improved digestibility of DM and GE (P < 0. 04), but digestibility of N was only improved with high-shear conditions (P < 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Full scale {{assembly}} welding of Ares I Upper Stage 5. 5 -Meter diameter {{cryogenic tank}} barrel segments has been {{performed at the}} Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). One full-scale developmental article produced under the Ares 1 Upper Stage project is the Manufacturing Demonstration Article (MDA) Barrel. This presentation {{will focus on the}} welded assembly of this barrel section, and associated lessons learned. Among the MDA articles planned on the Ares 1 Program, the Barrel was the first to be completed, primarily because the process of manufacture from piece parts (barrel panels) utilized the most mature friction stir process planned for use on the Ares US program: Conventional fixed pin Friction Stir Welding (FSW). This process is in use on other space launch systems, including the Shuttle s External Tank, the Delta IV common booster core, the Delta II, and the Atlas V rockets. The goals for the MDA Barrel development were several fold: 1) to prove out Marshall Space Flight Center s new Vertical Weld Tool for use in manufacture of cylindrical barrel sections, 2) to serve as a first run for weld qualification to a new weld specification, and 3) to provide a full size cylindrical section for downstream use in precision cleaning and Spray-on Foam Insulation development. The progression leading into the welding of the full size barrel included sub scale panel welding, subscale cylinder welding, a full length confidence weld, and finally, the 3 seamed MDA <b>barrel</b> <b>processing.</b> Lessons learned on this MDA program have been carried forward into the production tooling for the Ares 1 US Program, and {{in the use of the}} MSFC VWT in processing other large scale hardware, including two 8. 4 meter diameter Shuttle External Tank barrel sections that are currently being used in structural analysis to validate shell buckling models...|$|E
40|$|Currently, the {{refiners}} have to {{cope with}} an increasing demand of high quality distillates of tighter specifications, while facing the need to process increasingly heavier and poorer quality crudes. Furthermore, the recent trends to process heavy and lower cost crudes spurred the interest on residue upgrading, normally referred to as bottom of the <b>barrel</b> <b>processing,</b> as a means to fully exploit the crudes’ heavy fractions. To reach these goals, refiners are looking at optimizing production and improving selection of crudes and crude mixtures to be processed which can only be achieved through a detailed knowledge of the composition and quality of feed and finished products. Generally, to know the yield {{and the quality of the}} crude oils, it is necessary to perform an atmospheric distillation and to characterize their fractions at laboratory level (crude assay). In order to characterize the crude residue, a vacuum distillation is needed and the physical-chemical properties of the resulting fractions must be measured. The time required for these characterization measurements is between 2 and 3 weeks, the amount of sample needed is large, up to 10 Kg, and the overall routine is generally expensive in terms of instruments, man-hours and consumables. Furthermore, crudes quality is not constant and tends to fluctuate over time and with field. To ensure technically, economically, and environmentally proper refining operations there is a substantial need for fast analytical methods for characterization of crude oils and their residua. During this PhD research, as a fast and viable alternative, 1 H NMR spectroscopy, combined with chemometrics, has been used. To exploit the full information content of the NMR data acquired on complex systems, as crude oils, chemometric regression techniques as partial least squares (PLS) have been developed. The proton NMR spectra of neat crude samples have been recorded using a 300 -MHz laboratory spectrometer. PLS regression models for prediction were built using analytical data obtained at the SARTEC laboratory. The attention was focused on the study of the most common crude assay properties such as API gravity, TBP distillation yields, KUOP factor, pour point, total acidity number and sulfur, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content. Successively, it was proved that also other important physical-chemical parameters can be predicted using the NMR. Among these asphaltenes, carbon residue, metal content, and especially the breakdown of aromatic classes content which, despite their impact on process, have been overlooked in previous researches. In addition, this thesis, demonstrates the possibility to predict most of the properties of atmospheric and vacuum distillation residua directly from the 1 H NMR spectra of crudes. The speed of this method and most of all the possibility to avoid the distillation of the sample prior to analysis, opens to the opportunity to use real time property data of residua to evaluate process strategies and to assess the impact on downstream processes. Chemometric modelling was carried out for the most important property of residua, i. e. yields, density, viscosity, sulfur content, asphaltenes, carbon residue, nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon content...|$|E
40|$|Barrels for polymer {{extruders}} have {{to sustain}} severe service conditions. In the inner volume of a <b>barrel</b> for polymer <b>processing,</b> high temperature, high pressure and corrosive media lead to mixed forms of abrasive, adhesive wear and corrosion.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to compare the {{analytical}} and sensory attributes of wines aged in different storage containers for {{a certain period of}} aging. The theoretical section describes wine storage containers from history to the present, their advantages and disadvantages. There are more details of barrique <b>barrels,</b> their <b>processing</b> and burning. The following section discusses the selection of appropriate containers for alcoholic fermentation. There is an important process of biological degradation of acid before red wine maturing, which is described in the next chapter. A large part of the chapter is devoted to wine aging. There are some effects in terms of oxygen, depending on maturation, pH for red wine colours, pH of the acid. An important chapter is the aging of wines in barrique barrels, followed by a change of phenolic compounds, dependence of oak and volatile compounds on physico -chemical characteristics of wines. In subsequent chapters there is explained the concept of wine aging, there are cataracts, diseases and defects of wines that may occur during aging. In the experimental part I used two red wines and one white wine. Wines were divided into inert containers and various barrels of different manufacturers and volumes. Red wines were produced in the same technology manner and the aging conditions (temperature, humidity) were the same as well. The aim was to evaluate the analytical and sensory values of wines for the time of one year. The attempt for white wine was aimed for the time of three months. The main intention was to monitor changes in the content of phenolic compounds : polyphenols, anthocyanins, polyphenols amount of gallic acid, hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids. Differences for each wine were observed depending on the container size and the ripening time. The senzory evaluation was an important parameter. Wines matured in barrels showed aromatic complexity and tannin structure with finesse...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{launched}} to get exact bore-sighting {{value in the}} process of assembly for XK 11. Image processing method with Charged Coupled Device camera is chosen for the Error reduction of bore-sighting. The results of this method by using a CCD camera and the Testing Target Method are described in this paper. After we confirm the performance of the Dual-Barrel Weapon and that of the Firing Control System in the Dual Barrel Weapon System, the bore-sighting which {{is a part of the}} process in the system assembly is accomplished. In this process, the position of the barrel is identified by using the Testing Target Method that is an existing bore-sighting method. Then the fixing line of the Firing Control System is checked by a Day-Optical part. The precision of the boresighting is required within 1 mil, however the manual method using the human eyes makes it worse. Therefore CCD camera is installed in the eyepieces. Next, we can get the image of the sighting and the center coordinate values of the laser-pointer from each <b>barrel</b> by image <b>processing</b> method.

Influence of feed rate, screw speed, and <b>barrel</b> temperature on <b>processing</b> parameters (die pressure, product temperature, residence time, specific energy) were examined. Use of flow modeling was successful for describing the evolution of the main flow parameters during processing. Rheological properties of extruded samples exhibited network-like behavior and were characterized and modeled by Cole-Cole distributions. Changes in molecular sizes of proteins during extrusion were measured by chromatography and appeared to be correlated to molecular size between network strands, as derived from the rheological properties of the materials obtained. Depending on operating conditions, extrudates presented very different surface aspects, ranging from very smooth-surfaced extrudates with high swell to completely broken extrudates. The results indicated that extrudate breakup was caused by increasing network density, and some gliadins may have acted as cross- linking agents. Increasing network density resulted in decreasing mobility of polymeric chains, and 'protein melt' may no longer have been able to support the strain experienced during extrusion through the die. Increasing network density was reflected in increased plateau modulus and molecular size of protein aggregates. Increasing network structure appeared to be induced by the severity of the thermomechanical treatment, as indicated by specific mechanical energy input and maximum temperature reached...|$|R

40|$|Childhood {{exposure}} to low-level lead can permanently reduce intelligence, but the neurobiologic mechanism for {{this effect is}} unknown. We examined the impact of lead exposure {{on the development of}} cortical columns, using the rodent barrel field as a model. In all areas of mammalian neocortex, cortical columns constitute a fundamental structural unit subserving information <b>processing.</b> <b>Barrel</b> field cortex contains columnar processing units with distinct clusters of layer IV neurons that receive sensory input from individual whiskers. In this study, rat pups were exposed to 0, 0. 2, 1, 1. 5, or 2 g/liter lead acetate in their dam's drinking water from birth through postnatal day 10. This treatment, which coincides with the development of segregated columns in the barrel field, produced blood lead concentrations from 1 to 31 μg/dl. On postnatal day 10, the area of the barrel field and of individual barrels was measured. A dose-related reduction in barrel field area was observed (Pearson correlation = − 0. 740; P < 0. 001); mean barrel field area in the highest exposure group was decreased 12 % versus controls. Individual barrels in the physiologically more active caudoventral group were affected preferentially. Total cortical area measured in the same sections was not altered significantly by lead exposure. These data support the hypothesis that lead exposure may impair the development of columnar processing units in immature neocortex. We demonstrate that low levels of blood lead, in the range seen in many impoverished inner-city children, cause structural alterations in a neocortical somatosensory map...|$|R
40|$|Driven by a {{requirement}} {{to extend the}} lifespan of self-aligning lined spherical bearings, this research investigates the use of Elid (electrolytic in-process dressing) {{as a method of}} improving ball surface finish. Elid is a continuous and self-regulating electrochemical dressing process that modifies the surface of a grinding, lapping, or superfinishing wheel. It provides improved grit protrusion, impedes wheel loading / glazing and promotes effective cutting. The characteristics of the newly-developed Elid superfinishing process are in many ways fundamentally different to conventional superfinishing. The main difference is that the use of super-abrasives prevents the wheel from self-sharpening; the normal mechanism by which dulled conventional abrasives are removed and a wheel’s surface refreshed. Because the wheel’s performance and condition is continually maintained inprocess by the Elid system, metal resin bonded (MRB) wheels containing very small super-abrasives can be used. It is the utilization of these fine abrasives (30 to 0. 12 μm) that enables surface roughness values below 5 nm Ra to be consistently produced on the spherical surface of corrosion-resistant steel balls. This research provides an in-depth understanding of the Elid spherical superfinishing process; investigating the most effective use of the Elid system, wheel dressing requirements and process performance. Optimisation is provided in terms of evaluating the critical operating parameters, the most effective superfinishing cycle and the implications to the complete ball production chain. A range of techniques are used to evaluate processing performance and ball output quality. These include in-process monitoring of Elid and wheel spindle power levels, analysis of wheel condition, rates of ball surface generation and material removal, ball finish and form. Although predominantly concentrated on corrosion-resistant steel, testing is also conducted on titanium and various ball coatings. In investigating various ways of using the Elid system, this work considers electrodischarge truing, pre-process dressing, Elid 1, Elid 2, Elid 3, and Elid combined with electrolytically assisted superfinishing. The initial process solution of Elid 3 (electrodeless) superfinishing provides the capability of working on all standard size balls, however the dressing system lacks stability. The development of a fixturing system that has a small separate electrode enables Elid 1 (conventional) to be used on the majority of ball sizes. Elid 1 allows more aggressive and consistent dressing, a faster rate of ball material removal and thus a substantially reduced processing time. Results with a # 12, 000 wheel show that surface quality is vastly improved through the use of Elid whilst maintaining current production standards of form accuracy. Surface finishes of 2 nm Ra are achieved, which is an order of magnitude better than balls currently produced using <b>barrelling</b> / polishing. <b>Processing</b> times are equivalent or faster when using Elid 1. Alternatively, consistently sub 10 nm Ra finishes can be reached with a # 2, 000 wheel using Elid 2 (interval dressing). Generally MRB-CBN wheels provide a more effective carbide cutting action than conventional superfinishing wheels. Controlling wheel condition and achieving full and even ball to wheel conformity are the two most significant contributory factors to the success of Elid spherical superfinishing. Insufficient control of these factors results in poor output quality. Monitoring of wheel spindle and Elid power usage provides useful information in assessing the condition of the wheel and identifying potential problems. High spindle power correlates with fast material removal and is a result of high loads and a free cutting action. Elid processing can be employed for improving surface finish after the conventional honing stage, or after cylindrical grinding for improving both ball form and finish.
