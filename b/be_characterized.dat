He believes that although it initially served to satirize cults, it later took on some of their aspects. In 1992, allegations of cult-like behavior also appeared in the newspaper Bedfordshire on Sunday after a spate of SubGenius-themed vandalism struck the English town of Bedford.|$|E

Serologic tests and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), which measure variola virus-specific immunoglobulin and antigen have also been developed to assist in the diagnosis of infection.|$|E

5|$|Forming a minor of a pseudoforest by {{contracting}} some of {{its edges}} and deleting others produces another pseudoforest. Therefore, the family of pseudoforests is closed under minors, and the Robertson–Seymour theorem implies that pseudoforests can <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> {{in terms of a}} finite set of forbidden minors, analogously to Wagner's theorem characterizing the planar graphs as the graphs having neither the complete graph K5 nor the complete bipartite graph K3,3 as minors.|$|E

5|$|Given {{sufficiently}} high baryon densities {{and relatively}} low temperatures – possibly {{comparable to those}} found in neutron stars – quark matter is expected to degenerate into a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> by a condensation of colored quark Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge would be able to pass through it with no resistance.|$|E

5|$|With few exceptions, each neuron in {{the brain}} {{releases}} the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle. Thus, a neuron can <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> by the neurotransmitters that it releases. The great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and many others.|$|E

40|$|The author {{investigated}} histopathology of 615 consecutive duodenal specimens in our pathology laboratory. Computer {{search of}} the duodenal lesions was performed. Review of histological slides was done, when appropriate. The duodenal specimens were composed of 567 benign lesions and 48 malignant lesions. The 567 benign lesions were composed of chronic non-specific duodenitis in 334 cases (60. 0 %), duodenal ulcer in 101 cases (17, 8 %), heterotopic gastric mucosa in 81 cases (14. 3 %), hyperplastic polyp in 16 cases (2. 8 %), Brunner's gland hyperplasia in 14 cases (2. 5 %), Brunner's gland adenoma in 8 cases (1. 4 %), lymphoid polyp in 5 cases (0. 8 %), tubular adenoma in 4 cases (0. 7 %), lymphangioma in 2 cases (0. 4 %), endocrine nests in 1 case (0. 2 %), and amyloidosis in 1 case (0. 2 %). The chronic non-specific duodenitis <b>was</b> <b>characterized</b> by edema and lymphocytic infiltration. The duodenal ulcer <b>was</b> <b>characterized</b> by exudate, necrosis, granulation tissue and regenerative epithelium. The heterotopic gastric mucosa consisted of two types: one was composed of only foveolar epithelium (n= 21) and another foveolar epithelium and fundic glands (n= 60).

5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form between the equator and the 50th parallel. As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> as tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones, and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids. By 1972, the National Hurricane Center officially recognized this cyclone category. Subtropical cyclones began to receive names off the official tropical cyclone list in the Atlantic Basin in 2002. They have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones, and exist in areas of weak to moderate temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue in such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E

Initially, armed resistance groups could <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> as either Sunni nationalists {{who wanted to}} bring back the Ba'ath Party with Saddam Hussein, or anti-Saddam fighters. The first major leader of the insurgency in Anbar was Khamis Sirhan al-Muhammad, the Ba'ath party regional chairman for the Karbala Governorate, who was originally No. 54 on the US list of most-wanted Iraqis. According to the US military, Khamis received his funding and orders directly from Saddam, then still a fugitive.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Antillean {{music can}} <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> by the {{prominence}} of the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), {{and the importance of}} calypso-like song traditions.

Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E
5|$|Some critics, {{including}} Murray Rothbard, {{have sought}} to show that Keynes had sympathy with Nazism, {{and a number of}} writers described him as antisemitic. Keynes's private letters contain portraits and descriptions, some of which can <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> as antisemitic, others as philosemitic. Scholars have suggested that these reflect clichés current {{at the time that he}} accepted uncritically, rather than any racism. On several occasions Keynes used his influence to help his Jewish friends, most notably when he successfully lobbied for Ludwig Wittgenstein to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom, explicitly in order to rescue him from being deported to Nazi-occupied Austria. Keynes was a supporter of Zionism, serving on committees supporting the cause.|$|E
