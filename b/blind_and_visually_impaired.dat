40|$|The Braille {{system is}} a tactile {{language}} where each element is represented by a cell with six dot positions, arranged in three rows and two columns. Each dot position can be raised or otherwise allowing different configurations which can be felt by trained fingers. For caregivers with normal sights, training their fingers is not naturally easy. This paper presents an image processing approach to Braille dots recognition with alphanumeric conversion, whereby a person with normal eyesight is able to translate a raw Braille image captured by a mobile camera into the corresponding alphanumeric texts. Image pre-processing relies heavily on various segmentation algorithms in the MATLAB image processing Toolbox. This application is hoped to help the <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> the <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> {{community as well as}} their caregivers to translate Braille texts digitally, hence enhancing the communication and collaboration possibilities. </p...|$|R
40|$|The <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> the <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> are in {{a unique}} {{position}} to appreciate and make functional use of haptic devices. Designing devices for the blind is, however, more arduous than many researchers and inventors expect.

This survey provides an overview of current knowledge on blindness and rehabilitation technology relevant for the design of aids for the <b>blind,</b> <b>and</b> more particularly for the use of haptics with the blind.

40|$|We {{designed}} and built a haptically enhanced mouse for <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> severely <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> computer users. A haptic mouse uses tactile feedback to convey information about the cursor position on the screen. A basic trackball mouse was modified to include a brake to indicate when the pointer reaches {{the edge of the}} screen and a vibrating motor that alerts the user when the pointer passes over an icon or the edge of a window. In addition, an audio feedback feature was developed that provides information about what the pointer is over. The mouse connects through the USB port to a computer running Linux. A GUI in Java was developed to test the functionality of the mouse. Although there was a large variation in the performance of our test subjects, the results indicated that users who are unable to read the screen can locate and identify objects faster with haptic and speech feedback than with only speech feedback. They also demonstrated that users can determine basic spatial relationships between objects on a screen through exploration using the haptic mouse...|$|R

A {{number of studies have}} demonstrated that the average person is capable of relatively easily comprehending speech delivered at higher-than-normal rates, with the peak occurring at around 25% compression (that is, 25% faster than normal); this facility has been demonstrated in several languages.

[...] <b>Blind</b> <b>and</b> severely <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> subjects scored similar comprehension levels at even higher rates, up to 300-350 wpm.

For instance, accidents {{are by far the}} largest component of marginal external costs, {{and there is no reason}} to believe that EVs are less prone to accidents compared to their conventional counterparts. In fact, due to the noiseless characteristic of an EV, some believe that EVs are more prone to accidents involving pedestrians and especially those who are <b>blind,</b> <b>visually</b> <b>and</b> hearing <b>impaired.</b> Therefore, we believe that the marginal external costs of EVs are almost the same as those of conventional vehicles; our calculation for CO 2 cost per km gave a value of 0.0024 Euro, which should be added in the table above for the conventional vehicle.
