40|$|A future {{challenge}} will be understanding the extensive communication that most likely takes place in bacterial interspecies and interkingdom signaling between plants and bacteria. A major bacterial inter-cellular signaling system in Gram-negative bacteria is LuxI/R quorum sensing (QS) based on the production (via the LuxI-family proteins) and detection (via the LuxR-family proteins) of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) signaling molecules. LuxR proteins which have the same modular structure of QS LuxRs but are devoid of a cognate LuxI AHL synthase are called solos. LuxR solos have <b>been</b> shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> exogenous AHLs produced by neighboring cells as well endogenously produced AHLs. It is now also evident that some LuxR proteins have evolved from the ability <b>to</b> binding AHLs and respond <b>to</b> other molecules/signals. For example, recent {{research has shown that}} a sub-family of LuxR solos responds <b>to</b> small molecules produced by plants. This indicates the presence of a uni-directional interkingdom signaling system occurring from plants <b>to</b> bacteria. In addition LuxR solos have now been also implicated <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> endogenously produced signals which are not AHLs. In this Mini Review article we will discuss current trends and implications of the role of LuxR solos in bacterial responses <b>to</b> other signals using proteins related <b>to</b> AHL quorum sensing systems...|$|R
