40|$|AbstractThe IEEE 802. 11 {{standard}} provides {{fast recovery}} from frame losses using a rapid link level positive acknowledgment scheme. However, {{the adoption of}} positive acknowledgment leads to inefficient frame transmission. To improve efficiency of the acknowledgments mechanism in IEEE 802. 11, we propose a novel link layer protocol for wireless LANs. The proposed protocol is an adaptation of an ATM-based protocol, the Service Specific Connection <b>Oriented</b> <b>Protocol</b> (SSCOP), {{for use as a}} link layer protocol in wireless LANs. The protocol uses significantly less bandwidth on the return path and enhances the performance of data frame transmission. We evaluate and compare the performance of the protocol with IEEE 802. 11. The results show that the proposed protocol has a much better performance in an error-prone wireless environment, even when the bit error rate is severely degraded.

The original images are then subjected to bit modification,Gaussian noise and rotational noise. The hash values are recalculated for the modified images. Sensitivity and hit collision are calculated and are found to be comparable with that of MD 5 algorithm...|$|R

5000|$|A bit-oriented {{protocol}} is {{a communications}} protocol that sees the transmitted data as an opaque stream of bits with no semantics, or meaning. Control codes are {{defined in terms}} of bit sequences instead of characters. Bit <b>oriented</b> <b>protocol</b> can transfer data frames regardless of frame contents. It can also be stated as [...] "bit stuffing" [...] this technique allows the data frames to contain an arbitrary number of bits and allows character codes with arbitrary number of bits per character.|$|R
50|$|The Signaling {{technology}} is <b>byte</b> <b>oriented,</b> allowing transfer {{of a single}} UART data byte or more over noisy channel (such as the powerline) at bit-rate up to 115.2 kbit/s; Each transmitted byte is protected against errors caused by noisy environment. This method operates on a customer selected channel ranging in the HF band. A unique narrow band signaling modulation, based on combination of phase changes is used to transfer each byte. There is no restriction {{to the number of}} bytes, therefore, any UART-based standards such as RS-232, RS-485 and LIN-bus can use the DC-BUS as a physical layer. The received data by all the other nodes on that channel has a fixed latency of 3.5 bits. This simplicity of use allows every customer to design his own protocol or use common industry protocols such as LIN. A master slave upper layer protocol is suitable for network operation.|$|R

40|$|A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is {{a network}} {{consisting}} {{of a set of}} mobile hosts capable of communicating with each other without the assistance of base stations. In this paper we review five existing protocols for geocasting in a MANET environment. The goal of a geocasting protocol is to deliver data packets to a group of nodes that are with a specified geographical area, i. e., the geocast region. In an ad hoc environment, there are numerous scenarios which would benefit from geocast communication (e. g., to broadcast emergency information within a mile radius of a fire or to broadcast a coupon for coffee within a block of a Starbucks). In this paper, we classify current geocast routing protocols into two categories: data-transmission <b>oriented</b> <b>protocols</b> and routing creation <b>oriented</b> <b>protocols.</b> We present three protocols that forward data packets to a geocast region using different techniques: the Location-Based Multicast algorithm (LBM), Voronoi diagram based geocasting and a protocol called GeoGRID. We also present two protocols that create routes to send data packets to a geocast region: GeoTORA (a protocol which is the combination of the unicast protocol Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm and flooding in a geocast region) and a Mesh-based Geocast Routing Protocol. We present the details of these five geocast protocols in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} three {{application program}} interfaces to BPFS, a distributed, modular parallel file system designed for use on clusters of workstations. These interfaces are called API 0, CLI, and MPI-IO. API 0 {{is the first of}} an anticipated series of low-level, experimental client interfaces to BPFS. It is an "unconventional" interface in many respects: it is not particularly "UNIX-like", it is blockoriented rather than <b>byte</b> <b>oriented,</b> it reads and writes system buffers as well as user-defined data areas, and it is asynchronous. It also provides time-regulated "data streaming" operations and userlevel control of both server-side caching and per-file striping onto disks. Although API 0 can be used directly from a user application program, it can also be used "under" a more conventional interface, as has been done for the next two interfaces. CLI is a "C Library Interface" implemented on top of API 0 that exactly mimics the Standard C I/O library interface, but accesses parallel files s [...] ...|$|R
