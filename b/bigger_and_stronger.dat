25|$|The Serbian {{victory in}} the First World War was {{supposed}} to serve as compensation to this situation {{and there was an}} open debate between the followers of the Greater Serbia doctrine, that defended the incorporation of the parts of the defeated Austro-Hungarian Empire where Serbs lived to Serbia, opposed by the ones that supported an idea of uniting not only all the Serbian lands, but also to include other South Slav nations into a new country. Among other reasons, but also because of the fear of the creation of a <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>stronger</b> Orthodox Serbia, that could eventually became a Russian allied, the decision of making an ethnically mixed South Slav state, where other nationalities would balance the Serb hegemony, was made.|$|E
25|$|The Great Wall of China is {{a series}} of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, {{generally}} built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe.

500|$|In the 1981 NFL Draft, Taylor {{was drafted}} by the NFL's New York Giants as the 2nd pick overall. In a poll of NFL General Managers (GMs) taken before the draft 26 of the league's 28 GMs said {{if they had the}} first {{selection}} they would select Taylor. One of the two GMs who said they would not take Taylor was Bum Phillips, who had just been hired as coach and general manager by the New Orleans Saints. As fate would have it for Taylor, the Saints were also the team who had the first pick in the draft. Giants GM George Young predicted before the draft that he would be better than NFL legends such as Dick Butkus: [...] "Taylor is the best college linebacker I've ever seen.

[...] He discussed [...] "Wrestlers" [...] in the band's interview with The Sun, explaining that the song is [...] "musically and lyrically quite direct" [...] because [...] "it doesn't have thousands of layers", in contrast to the song [...] "Bendable Poseable". The concept of the song [...] "Wrestlers", originates from a text message from James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. After Doyle toured with Murphy, Murphy sent a text message that said, [...] "Sorry you can't have Al back, I'll wrestle you for him. And I'll beat you because I'm <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>stronger</b> than you."

Weber scraped his face, hands and arms with the cinders from the track. When he handed the ball to an official, the official said, “Weber, you dummy, don't you know the rule changed this year and the ball belonged to Michigan when it went out of bounds?” Weber replied, “Sure I knew, but I wasn't sure you did.” Asked in 1977 about how modern football players differed from his era, Weber conceded that modern players were <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>stronger,</b> yet noted: [...] "But players had more stamina in the old football game.
