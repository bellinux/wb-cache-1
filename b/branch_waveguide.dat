This novel hybrid design is based on Reed's multiple <b>branch</b> <b>waveguide</b> hybrid.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{work done}} in improving the sideband rejection ratio for 2 SB cryogenic radio astronomy receivers in general, but more specifically, for the future Onsala 20 m 3 -mm receiver system and the ALMA Band 5. In order to attain better than 15 dB sideband rejection ratio over the entire bandwidth (approximately 26 % RF fractional bandwidth and one octave the IF bandwidth), {{it is necessary to}} improve both RF and IF hybrid assembly to optimum performance, i. e. making the hybrids with minimum achievable amplitude and phase imbalance. For this reasons, a 4 - 8 GHz IF assembly comprising a compact 90 ° hybrid chip, two bias-T circuits and two transmission line circuits was designed and characterised. The compact size of the hybrid chip allows it to be integrated into virtually any sideband separating (2 SB) mixer operating at cryogenic temperatures and is furthermore especially advantageous for multi-pixel 2 SB receivers or low noise balanced amplifier layouts. The hybrid was fabricated using thin-film technology on Si-substrates and uses air bridges to inter-connect the fingers of the coupler. The hybrid assembly that integrates the bias-T circuit using a MMIC-like approach, where capacitors are integrated on-chip and fabricated using thin-film technology and micro-fabrication. Characterization of the hybrid assembly was performed at a cryogenic temperature of 4 K and sophisticated calibration and fixture de-embedding procedures was used. The measurement result shows that the IF hybrid assembly has state of the art performance, with amplitude and phase imbalance better than 0. 5 dB and ± 2 ° respectively at cryogenic temperatures. In order to allow complete characterization of the ALMA Band 5 cartridge a highly versatile measurement setup has been built. The measurement setup includes all necessary hardware and achieves automatic measurements for the system noise and sideband rejection with inbuilt optimization procedures. The measurement setup additionally comprises measurements of the receiver saturation, phase and amplitude stability, as well as optical beam characterization. The performance of the IF hybrid was verified in ALMA Band 5 receiver cartridge using the ALMA Band 5 measurement setup, demonstrating an average sideband rejection ratio of better than 15 dB, i. e. an improvement of 3 - 9 dB. To further improve the sideband rejection ratio, a novel design for a RF 90 ° waveguide hybrid was proposed (163 - 211 GHz). This suggested hybrid employs the multiple <b>branch</b> <b>waveguide</b> design. The specific feature of the proposed hybrid design is the use of controllable ripple in the operational frequency band for achieving better overall amplitude imbalance.

In this thesis, an on-chip spectroscopy system based on coplanar waveguide (CPW) technology has been designed, optimised and tested, in order to probe spectral features of overlaid polycrystalline materials. As proof of principle, this system was used to recover the THz spectra of α-lactose monohydrate, observing spectral features at 0. 53 THz and 1. 37 THz. A significant frequency shift in the 1. 37 THz feature was observed when the on-chip spectroscopy measurements were performed over a variable temperature range of (6 - 293 K). Spectral features obtained from the on-chip system were also compared to those obtained from a free-space THz-TDS system to highlight the benefits of using an on-chip system over free space THz-TDS. A theoretical model developed using Ansoft HFSS tool was then used to optimise device design parameters in the second generation of CPW devices. In doing so, the bandwidth of the system was enhanced from 0. 42 to 1. 6 THz and a much higher frequency resolution of (2 GHz) was obtained compared to that of the first-generation CPW devices (55 GHz) with the modified device design of second generation devices. <b>Branching</b> <b>waveguide</b> systems (THz Y-splitter and coupler) were also simulated, fabricated and measured in order to investigate THz pulse splitting in <b>branching</b> <b>waveguides.</b> These systems allow the measurement of both a sampled and reference pulse.
