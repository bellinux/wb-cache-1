Response surface methodology {{and the central}} composite design were employed in determining the optimal condition. The optimization goal in this paper has been set for maximum CO 2 capturing.

The CO 2 capture capacity could reach 126 g CO 2 /kg SL at optimal condition. The increased reaction temperature will lead to an obvious decrease of CaCO 3 and increase of MgCO 3. If deployed, this optimized indirect CO 2 mineral sequestration process could permanently capture 252, 000 tons of CO 2 per annum based upon current 2 million tons of SL productivity per annum. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

Simulation of the steel bath and oxygen is carried out by using water and air, respectively. Effect of process variables on the LD steelmaking practice has been studied and the findings ascertain penetration depth of the oxygen jet into the liquid (metal) pool as a strong function of bath (lance) height, gas flow rate and nozzle exit diameter. Furthermore, an equation is developed by carrying out regression analysis using results obtained from numerical simulation.

40|$|Alkaline {{industrial}} wastes are considered potential {{resources for the}} mitigation of CO 2 emissions by simultaneously capturing and sequestering CO 2 through mineralization. Mineralization safely and permanently stores CO 2 through its reaction with alkaline earth metals. These elements are found {{in a variety of}} abundantly available {{industrial wastes}} that have high reactivity with CO 2, and that are generated close to the emission point-sources. Among all suitable industrial wastes, steelmaking slag has been deemed the most promising given its high CO 2 uptake potential. In this paper, we review recent publications related to the influence of process parameters on the carbonation rate and conversion extent of steelmaking slags, comparing and analyzing them in order to define the present state of the art. Furthermore, the maximum conversions resulting from different studies are directly compared using a new index, the Carbonation Weathering Rate (CWR), which normalizes the results based on particle size and reaction duration.

The effects of BL percentage, carbonization temperature, carbonization duration and the binary combined effect of each individual process parameter on the removal of SO 2 have been statistically analyzed. The optimal preparation conditions were 48 %[*]=[*]BL/(BL[*]+[*]SS), carbonized at 860 °C for 50 minutes (labeled BL-SS- 48 - 860 - 50).

The prepared hybrid adsorbent showed good SO 2 removal performance.

40|$|A {{large amount}} of filter cake wastes are {{produced}} from the gas cleaning systems of blast furnace (BF) ironmaking and <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> furnace (BOF) <b>steelmaking</b> processes. The filter cake wastes cannot be directly recycled through the ironmaking process due to the high zinc contents and are therefore, predominantly, stockpiled. The storage of filter cake wastes presents a long- Term environmental issue but also an opportunity to extract or recover the iron content, motivating a search for processes or technologies to allow their cost-effective recycling. In this study, two filter cake wastes from BlueScope Ltd. were sintered at 1 100 - 1 300 °C in argon and air to evaluate the effects of temperature, gas atmosphere and carbon content on the mineral phase formation and zinc removal of sintered filter cake specimens.

40|$|<b>Basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> furnace (BOF) <b>steelmaking</b> slag is {{enriched in}} {{potentially}} toxic V which may become mobilised in high pH leachate during weathering. BOF slag was weathered under aerated and air-excluded conditions for 6 {{months prior to}} SEM/EDS and µXANES analysis to determine V host phases and speciation in both primary and secondary phases. Leached blocks show development of an altered region in which free lime and dicalcium silicate phases were absent and Ca-Si-H was precipitated (CaCO 3 was also present under aerated conditions). µXANES analyses show that V was released to solution as V(V) during dicalcium silicate dissolution and some V was incorporated into neo-formed Ca-Si-H. Higher V concentrations were observed in leachate under aerated conditions than in the air-excluded leaching experiment. Aqueous V concentrations were controlled by Ca 3 (VO 4) 2 solubility which demonstrate an inverse relationship between Ca and V concentrations. Under air-excluded conditions Ca concentrations were controlled by dicalcium silicate dissolution and Ca-Si-H precipitation, leading to relatively high Ca and correspondingly low V concentrations. Formation of CaCO 3 under aerated conditions provided a sink for aqueous Ca, allowing higher V concentrations limited by kinetic dissolution rates of dicalcium silicate. Thus V release may be slowed by the precipitation of secondary phases in the altered region, improving the prospects for slag reuse...|$|R

40|$|In China, {{iron and}} steel plants are confronted with {{increased}} demands to reduce their CO 2 emissions. Data on CO 2 emissions derived from {{iron and steel}} making is a basic requirement for a certificate of CO 2 reduction. In the current paper, carbon flows from blast furnace and <b>basic</b> <b>oxygen</b> furnace (BF-BOF) <b>steelmaking</b> systems are analyzed using Material Flow Analysis (MFA). The computation method is built and used to calculate CO 2 emissions in three steel works. The amount of carbon flow and CO 2 emission per ton of product (EFCO 2) of each process in BF-BOF steeling systems is obtained. The results show that the EFCO 2 of each process varies significantly. As for the highest percentage of parts, the EFCO 2 of the blast furnace iron making is greater than 700 kg on average; however, the EFCO 2 of casting is only roughly 50 kg. The EFCO 2 of the same process is more influenced by the firm size, and the main production equipment scale plays a small role. In the end, the input of coal and coke is decreased by using charcoal instead, CO 2 is removed from blast furnace gas along with carbon capture and storage, and traditional energy saving approaches/technologies for CO 2 reduction for the iron and steel industry are introduced. </p...|$|R
