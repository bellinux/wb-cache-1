Airstones are sold in a very wide variety of shapes, sizes, and levels of coarseness - from extremely rough, producing larger (though still typically unnoticeable) bubbles and letting in more oxygen - to very fine, producing minuscule bubbles.

Consequently, the project is coached by a varied group of industrial partners, which has specified five relevant applications and appropriate performance criteria to be further investigated. Over ten adhesive manufacturers and suppliers have been approached to suggest adhesives for these applications. Of the 48 suggested adhesives, about 30 have been subjected to experimental testing in a broad screening to be able to select adhesives for further detailed investigations. This way, also adhesives which usually are outside the scope of glass research could be investigated, such as methacrylates. Furthermore, each major adhesive family is featured: silicones, polyurethanes, MS-polymers, acrylates, and epoxies. The screening constits of lap-shear tests on three sets of specimens for each adhesive.
