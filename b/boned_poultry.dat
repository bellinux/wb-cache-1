40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the possibility of}} producing phosphorus fertilizers through Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans utilization in secondary raw materials solubilization. Phosphorus {{was obtained from the}} <b>bones</b> of <b>poultry</b> and fish as well as from Morocco phosphorite. Four doses of <b>poultry</b> <b>bones</b> and fish bones were used in the experiment (2, 4, 10 and 20 g/L) and two doses (2 and 4 g/L) of phosphorite were also used. The experimenters measured the final pH, which increased in proportion to {{the increase in the number}} of <b>poultry</b> <b>bone</b> doses, whereas in the case of fish bones it decreased in proportion to the increase in the number of fish bone doses. Only in the case of phosphorite, where 10 g/L were used, there was a slight increase in pH during solubilization observed. The highest phosphorus concentration of 1. 9 % (expressed as P 2 O 5) was found for the solubilization performed on fish bones with the highest dose (20 g/L). The formulation obtained in this study meets the necessary requirements for use as a bio-fertilizer because of the relatively low content of P 2 O 5 and the low content of toxic elements. The results confirm the utilization of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans in the biosolubilization of phosphorus renewable raw materials that can alleviate the problem of the world’s depleting phosphorite deposits...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Adolescent meat-type {{poultry and}} cage layers exhibit a high {{incidence}} of bone problems that include bone weakness, deformity, breakage, and infec-tion and osteoporosis-related mortalities. These problems include economic and welfare issues. To improve <b>bone</b> quality in <b>poultry,</b> it is essential to understand the physio-logical basis of bone maturity and strength in poultry. A complex array of factors that include structural, architec-tural, compositional, physiological, and nutritional fac-tors interactively determine bone quality and strength.

Chicks fed biotin-deficient diets (0 (xg/kg diet) exhibited varus deformities, footpad dermatitis, shortened tibiotarsi, and significantly higher bone densities and percentage bone ash. Anatomically there were two different bone modeling patterns. The mid-diaphyseal cortex was thickest laterally in chicks fed adequate biotin and thickest medially in biotin-deficient chicks. Periosteal bone appositional and bone formation rates, osteoid perimeter, and osteoid area of perimeter were reduced in tibiotarsi of chicks fed diets deficient in biotin compared with effects in chicks fed adequate biotin.

The SBM diet had the highest apparent digestibility for dry matter (ADMD) (84. 5 %), crude protein (ACPD) (94. 1 %) and gross energy (AGED) (91. 4 %), while the lowest value was obtained for the diet containing MBM (75. 9 % ADMD; 88. 5 % ACPD; 85. 5 % AGED). Overall, ACPD was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) for diets containing plant-based ingredients (93. 5 %) than for animal based ones (90. 0 %). Similar trends were observed when dry matter and crude protein digestibilities were compared for specific feed ingredients. Specific activities of protease, amylase, cellulase and lipase in mid gut (MG) gland extracts were also determined for redclaw fed test diets. Generally, carbohydrase and lipase activities in individuals fed plant-based diets {{were significantly higher than}} in those fed animal-based diets. A significant correlation was observed for enzyme activity and ADC values. Protease activity was negatively correlated with diet ADMD, ingredient (I) ADMD, IACPD and IAGED, while lipase activity was positively correlated with ACPD and IACPD. Amylase/protease ratio (A/P) was positively correlated with all digestibility coefficients except AGED. Based on these observations, we conclude that redclaw have the capacity to successfully utilise nutrients from a broad range of dietary ingredients including animal, single cell and in particular, plant matter in their diet. We also suggest that digestive enzyme secretions and the ratio in which they occur, {{play a key role in}} determining digestibility of nutrients by redclaw...|$|R

40|$|Tetracyclines, which {{represent}} {{one of the}} most commonly used antibiotics for poultry, are known to be deposited in bones, where they can remain, despite the observation of appropriate withdrawal times. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the concentration of oxytretracycline (OTC) residues in the bone and muscle of chickens, following the oral administration of a commercially available liquid formulation, and to test their cytotoxic effects on an in vitro cell culture model. Seventy-two 1 -day-old broiler chickens were randomly allotted into 2 groups (control and treated animals). OTC (40 mg/kg BW) was administered via drinking water during the 1 to 5 and 20 to 25 days of life periods. At the end of the trial, the birds were slaughtered and the OTC residues in the target tissues were measured by means of liquid chromatography (LC) - tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Cytotoxicity was assessed by evaluating the pro-apoptotic effect of the bone residues on the K 562 erythroleukemic line and on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In all the animals, the OTC residues in the muscle were far below the established MRL of 100 μg/kg. The OTC levels in the bones of the treated animals were instead found in the parts per million (ppm) range. Cell cytotoxicity was assessed by evaluating the pro-apoptotic effect of OTC bone residues on the haematopoietic cell system. This in vitro system has revealed a significant pro-apoptotic effect on both the K 562 cell line and PBMC cultures. This result suggests potential human and animal health risks due to the entry of tetracycline residues contained in the bones of treated livestock into the food-chain. This could be of concern, particularly for canine and feline diets, as meat, <b>bone</b> meal, and <b>poultry</b> by-products represent some of the main ingredients of pet foods, especially in the case of dry pet food. Further studies are needed to define the underlying mechanisms of cytotoxicity and to evaluate the in vivo toxicological implications due to the observed in vitro effects...|$|R
40|$|Directive 2003 / 126 /EC {{defines the}} method for the {{determination}} of constituents of animal origin for official control of feedingstuffs. One of the hardest problems for microscopist is the differentiation between mammalian and <b>poultry</b> <b>bones</b> {{on the basis of}} some characteristics as colour and borders of the fragments, shape and density of osteocyte lacunae. The shape of osteocyte lacuna in poultry and mammals is often described in different way, elliptic or roundish according with the Author(s). The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the characteristics of lacunae in chicken bones of different type. For this purpose, smashed fragments and histological sections of the same bone were compared in order to evaluate the microscopic aspect of lacunae in different breaking and trimming planes. According to the observations carried out, it was possible to infer that chicken osteocyte has a biconvex lens shape; however the different arrangement and some size variation of the osteocytes in the several bone segments influence the microscopic features of corresponding lacunae. Chicken bone is made of a parallel-fibered tissue, without osteons. This structure probably determines the plane fracture of the bone and consequently the different aspect of lacunae (from spindle-shaped to elliptic-roundish) we can see in chicken derived PAP (processed animal protein). For example, in the fragments obtained from smashed diaphysis, the prevalence of spindle-shaped lacunae is depending on the preferential breaking of the bone along longitudinal plane. Likewise, for the epiphysis, being made mostly by bone trabeculae with strange directions, the breaking happens along different planes, creating lacunae of various shape. Performing the official check of animal feedingstuffs, the presence of bone fragments with roundish or elliptic osteocyte lacunae induces the analyst to thinking that the meat and bone meal comes respectively from mammals and poultry or vice versa depending to the reference Author(s); apart from the final evaluation (also based on some other features of the fragments), it is important to consider that the chicken bones could show lacunae of different shapes (spindle, elliptic and roundish), in accordance with the type and the breaking of the involved skeleton segments...|$|R
40|$|The use of viscera and <b>bone</b> meal in <b>poultry</b> pre-starter and starter {{diets and}} its effects on performance, {{digestive}} organ development and digestibility and nutrient retention were evaluated. In the first assay, 280 -day-old Avian Cobb® chicks were allotted in four experimental groups with five replicates of 14 birds each, in the pre-starter phase; in the second assay, 280 eight-day-old Avian Cobb 48 ® chicks were allotted in four experimental groups with five replicates of 12 birds each. The experimental diet consisted of increasing levels of viscera and bone meal: 0 % (control diet), 3 %, 6 % and 9 % in pre-starter (Assay 1) and starter (Assay 2) diets, to meet nutritional requirements and feed composition proposed by the Brazilian Tables, all of them isonutritive and isoenergetic. A metabolic assay was developed and the total excreta collection was performed from the 4 th to the 7 th days in Assay 1 and from the 14 th to the 17 th days in Assay 2. On these days, one chick per experimental unit, representing the mean body weight of the parcel, was euthanized to perform digestive organ morphometry. Mean body weight was 45. 4 ± 0. 4 on the 1 st day in Assay 1 and 179. 5 ± 0. 8 at 8 days of age in Assay 2. In Assay 1, a negative linear effect was observed for weight gain. Levels of viscera and bone meal influenced quadratically nitrogen digestibility index (Y = 66. 0101 + 0. 482425 X - 0. 0481086 X²) and linearly the digestibility of dry matter (Y = 71. 7775 - 0. 615792 X) and ether extract (Y = 78. 3678 - 0. 309136 X). Morphometric measures of digestive organs were not influenced by viscera and bone meal levels. For Assay 2, negative and linear effect was observed for viscera and bone meal levels on weight gain (Y = 551. 667 - 5. 08341 X) and feed intake (Y = 955. 961 - 7. 48435 X). Quadratic effect was observed for ether extract digestibility (Y = 82. 557 + 1. 12021 X - 0. 150117 X²) and maximum point was obtained at 3. 7 % viscera and bone meal inclusion for ether extract retention.

Foram determinados os coeficientes de digestibilidade aparente (CDA) dos aminoácidos essenciais, proteína, energia e matéria seca das farinhas de resíduo do processamento de salmão (FRS), de vísceras de aves (FVA), de carne e ossos e de penas hidrolisadas, além do concentrado proteico (CPS) e farelo de soja e glútens de milho e trigo para juvenis de jundiá, Rhamdia quelen (peso médio: 160 g). A dieta referência e as dietas teste (compostas por 69, 9 % da dieta referência, 30 % de um dos ingredientes teste e 0, 1 % de óxido de ítrio) foram ofertadas (10 e 16 h) aos peixes e as coletas das fezes foram {{realizadas}} a cada 5 h (23, 4 e 9 h), após sedimentação em tubos coletores. Os resultados dos CDA?s mostraram que o jundiá aproveitou melhor os ingredientes vegetais frente aos animais. Entre os ingredientes avaliados, destaca-se o CPS, a FVA e a FRS, que além de serem bem digeridos, atenderam adequadamente às exigências em aminoácidos essenciais do jundiá. A partir dos valores de nutrientes digestíveis desses ingredientes, foram formuladas cinco dietas contendo diferentes relações de energia digestível:proteína digestível (ED:PD = 12, 11, 10, 9 e 8 kcal/g), as quais foram empregadas na avaliação do desempenho de jundiás com peso médio de 31 g. Cada dieta foi fornecida até a saciedade aparente a três grupos de 25 peixes às 9 e 16 h por 75 dias, sendo os mesmos submetidos a biometrias quinzenais. A sobrevivência foi de 100 % em todos os tratamentos e as análises de regressão mostraram que as diferentes ED:PD afetaram (P Abstract : Apparent digestibility coefficients (CDA) for essential amino acids, protein, {{energy and}} dry matter of salmon fishmeal (FRS), poultry byproduct meal (FVA), meat and <b>bone</b> meal, <b>poultry</b> feather meal hydrolyzed feathers, soybean protein concentrate (CPS), soybean meal, corn gluten meal and wheat gluten meal were evaluated for juvenile jundiá, Rhamdia quelen (185 g, average body weight). A reference diet and seven test diets (comprised of 69. 9 % reference diet, 30 % test ingredient, and 0. 1 % yttrium oxide) were fed to fish at 10 and 16 h. Following tank cleaning, feces {{were collected by}} sedimentation, every 5 h (23, 4 and 9 h). Our CDA results showed that jundiá valued plant over animal ingredients. Among the assessed ingredients, CPS, FVA and FRS showed to be well digested and able to meet fish?s essential amino acid requirements. Subsequently, five diets were formulated, considering the digestible values of these ingredients, to have different energy to protein ratios (ED:PD = 12; 11; 10; 9 and 8 kcal/g), and were fed to jundiá (31 g average weight). Each diet, were fed twice daily (9 and 16 h) to three groups of 25 fish, during 75 days. Fish weight was evaluated every 15 days. Survival rates was 100 % for all diet groups and regression analysis showed that the different dietary ED:PD ratios affected (p< 0. 05) all performance and economic variables, {{as well as the}} deposition of body fat. Diets containing 12 and 8 kcal/g yielded poorer performances, whereas diets containing ED:PD from 9 to 11 kcal/g favored weight gain (GPD), protein retention rates (TRP) and feed conversion (CA), also allowing for better feeding costs and less body fat buildup. Considering the variables GPD and CA, the best dietary ED:PD was estimated to be 9. 08 kcal/g (38. 28 % and 3437. 5 kcal/g) and 9. 58 kcal/g (36, 07 % and 3125 kcal/g), respectively. However, when pondering on TRP and CMA, optimal dietary ED:PD was 10. 34 kcal/g (32. 29 % and 3229 kcal/g) and 10. 4 kcal/g (33. 38 % and 3200 kcal/g), respectively...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryMichael D. TokachA {{total of}} 5, 212 nursery pigs {{were used in}} 11 {{experiments}} to evaluate amino acids in nursery pig diets. Experiments 1 and 2 were conducted {{to determine whether the}} Lys level fed during one phase of the nursery influenced the response to Lys during subsequent phases. Experiment 1 tested a wide range of dietary Lys in 2 phases and reported that pigs fed high Lys during each period had increased growth performance; however, compensatory growth occurred for the pigs previously fed low Lys diets, resulting in no impact on overall ADG or final BW. Experiment 2 tested a narrow range of dietary Lys in 3 phases and found that marginally deficient diets can be fed in the early nursery phases without influencing final BW or the response to Lys levels in subsequent phases. Both experiments demonstrate that the low dietary Lys levels used in each can be fed in the early nursery phases with no negative impact on overall nursery growth rate provided that adequate levels are fed thereafter. Experiments 3 to 6 were conducted to determine the standardized ileal digestible (SID) Lys requirement of nursery pigs from 7 - to 14 -kg. Data from all experiments were combined and break-point and quadratic broken-line analysis was used to determine the estimated SID Lys requirement. The SID Lys requirement for optimal growth was at least 1. 30 % for ADG and 1. 37 % for G:F, or at least 3. 86 and 4. 19 g SID Lys/Mcal ME, respectively. Experiments 7 to 11 were conducted to evaluate the effect of replacing specialty protein sources with crystalline AA and AA requirements for 7 - to 12 -kg pigs. Experiment 7 demonstrated that crystalline AA can be used to replace fish meal in diets with no negative effects on growth performance. Experiment 8 demonstrated that L-Trp, L-Val, and a source of non-essential AA were needed in low-CP, AA-fortified nursery diets to achieve maximum growth performance, whereas the addition of L-Ile was not required. Experiment 9 indicated that feeding greater than 7. 35 % total Lys:CP decreased growth performance and Exp. 10 indicated that a SID Val:Lys ratio of 65 % was sufficient for optimal growth of early nursery pigs. Implementing the results from the previous experiments, Exp. 11 determined that crystalline AA in nursery pigs diets can replace high amounts of fish meal, meat and <b>bone</b> meal, and <b>poultry</b> meal when balanced for minimum AA ratios and maximum Lys:CP with no negative effect on growth performance...|$|R

Pronađeno je jedanaest paljevinskih grobova, od kojih se pojedini izdvajaju veličinom i dubinom ukopa grobne rake te odgovaraju slici dokumentiranoj 1998. godine. Po prvi puta zabilježeno je kako su u jednom grobu spaljeni ostaci pokojnice s predmetima nošnje i nakita bili položeni u zdjelu koja ima funkciju urne. Isto tako, zabilježen je i grob u kojem su pronađeni spaljeni ostaci pokojnika bez ijednog nalaza. Osim groba ratnika s naoružanjem i toaletnim priborom, izdvajaju se i grobovi bogatije opremljenih pokojnica s dosad nezabilježenim predmetima nošnje i nakita, poput cjelovito sačuvane staklene narukvice ili željezne igle sa zoomorfnom glavicom. Na osnovi priloga naoružanja te predmeta ženske i muške nošnje, grobovi se datiraju u Mokronog IIb stupanj te potvrđuju iznimnu važnost nalazišta u proučavanju razdoblja mlađeg željeznog doba u sjevernoj Hrvatskoj. Rescue {{excavations}} of the La Tène culture cemetery Zvonimirovo - Veliko Polje during 2011 {{were conducted}} on {{the central part of}} the elevation where 11 incineration burials (LT 83 -LT 93) were found. For the first time the grave was recorded (LT 86) with burnt remains of the deceased with parts of the costume and jewellery, placed in a bowl used as an urn (Fig. 5). Also, a grave was found with burnt remains of the deceased without any findings. The graves in which men were buried contain armament, toiletries and parts of the costume, with the findings from the grave LT 89 standing out indeed (Fig. 4). The grave LT 83 (Fig. 2) contained toiletries (scissors, razor), whetstone, iron fibula of the Middle La Tène scheme and an iron axe laid next to the bones of the deceased, which is the first finding of this type on the Zvonimirovo cemetery. Particularly prominent are the graves of the lavishly furnished deceased women with an unprecedented parts of costumes and jewellery, such as perfectly preserved bracelets with five smooth ribs made of transparent glass with a yellow foil on the inside of the Series 27 or group 7 a (Fig. 5) or iron needles with a zoomorphic head in grave LT 91. Provisions (viaticum), recorded in the graves of both sexes, consist of pottery and animal bones, mostly pork, whereas the <b>poultry</b> <b>bones</b> are more frequently found inside the bowls. The sets consisting of a pot and a bowl are the most frequent finds in the graves, but kantharoi and cups can be found as well. The grave LT 83 (Fig. 2) stands out with a number of ceramic vessels found in it; i. e. four enclosed ceramic vessels. Based on the contributed armament and parts of women’s and men’s costumes, the graves are dated to the Mokronog IIb phase, and confirm the importance of the site in the study of the Late Iron Age in northern Croatia.
