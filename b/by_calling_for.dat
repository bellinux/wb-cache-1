5|$|A {{nationalist}} {{movement in the}} Belgian Congo demanding the end of colonial rule led to the country's independence on 30 June 1960. Minimal preparations had been made and many issues, such as the questions of federalism and ethnicity, remained unresolved. In {{the first week of}} July, a mutiny broke out in the army and violence erupted between black and white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites and two areas of the country, Katanga and South Kasai, seceded with Belgian support. Amid continuing unrest and violence, the United Nations deployed peacekeepers, but the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld refused to use these troops to help the central government in Léopoldville fight the secessionists. Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, the charismatic leader of the largest nationalist faction, reacted <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> assistance from the Soviet Union, which promptly sent military advisors and other support.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 1861, President Lincoln {{responded to}} the {{surrender}} of the federal fort after the Battle of Fort Sumter <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> 75,000 volunteers to join the Union army and restore order. Governor Morton telegraphed Lincoln offering 10,000 Hoosier men to defend the country, but the state's initial quota was set at six regiments (a total of 4,683 men) for three months of service. Orders were issued on April 16 to form Indiana's first regiments and establish Indianapolis a gathering point for volunteers to enlist. On the first day, 500 men were encamped in the city. Within a week, more than 12,000 recruits had signed up {{to fight for the}} Union, nearly three times as many needed to meet the state's initial quota.|$|E
5|$|Johann Tetzel {{responded to}} the Theses <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> Luther to be burnt for heresy and having theologian Konrad Wimpina write 106 theses against Luther's work. Tetzel defended these in a disputation before the University of Frankfurt on the Oder in January 1518. 800 copies of the printed disputation were sent to be sold in Wittenberg, but {{students}} of the University seized them from the bookseller and burned them. Luther became increasingly fearful that the situation was out of hand {{and that he would}} be in danger. To placate his opponents, he published a Sermon on Indulgences and Grace, which did not challenge the pope's authority. This pamphlet, written in German, was very short and easy for laypeople to understand. Luther's first widely successful work, it was reprinted twenty times. Tetzel responded with a point-by-point refutation, citing heavily from the Bible and important theologians. His pamphlet was not nearly as popular as Luther's. Luther's reply to Tetzel's pamphlet, on the other hand, was another publishing success for Luther.|$|E

5|$|U.S. President Herbert Hoover {{signed the}} Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act into law on June 17, 1930. The tariff's {{aim was to}} protect {{agriculture}} in the United States, but congressional representatives ultimately raised tariffs {{on a host of}} manufactured goods resulting in average duties as high as 53% on over a thousand various goods. Twenty-five trading partners responded in kind by introducing new tariffs {{on a wide range of}} U.S. goods. Hoover was pressured and compelled to adhere to the Republican Party's 1928 platform, which sought protective tariffs to alleviate market pressures on the nation's struggling agribusinesses and reduce the domestic unemployment rate. The culmination of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression heightened fears, further pressuring Hoover to act on protective policies against the advice of Henry Ford and over 1,000 economists who protested <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> a veto of the act. Exports from the United States plummeted 60% from 1930 to 1933. Worldwide international trade virtually ground to a halt. The international ramifications of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, comprising protectionist and discriminatory trade policies and bouts of economic nationalism, are credited by economists with prolongment and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression.|$|E

50|$|It was {{the first}} change in tariff laws since the Dingley Act of 1897. President William Howard Taft called Congress into a special session in 1909 shortly after his inauguration to discuss the issue. Thus, the House of Representatives {{immediately}} passed a tariff bill sponsored <b>by</b> Payne, <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> reduced tariffs. However, the United States Senate speedily substituted a bill written <b>by</b> Aldrich, <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> fewer reductions and more increases in tariffs.|$|R
50|$|The 1964 Republican Platform was {{dominated}} by Goldwater conservatives, which meant the platform {{was dominated}} <b>by</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> limited government, condemnations of the Kennedy and Johnson foreign and domestic policy, <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> more open space for free enterprise, a hard-line against Communist North Vietnam, <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> reform of the United Nations, a staunch support of NATO, <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> lower taxes, a hard-line against international Communism, and an accusation that the Kennedy-Johnson Administration was guilty of Munich-like appeasement for having opened a hotline with the Soviet Union and not with American allies.|$|R
25|$|Early in the 20th century, as the tercentennial of the 1607 Founding of Jamestown in the Virginia Colony neared, {{leaders in}} Norfolk, Virginia began a {{campaign}} to have the celebration held there.

25|$|With its {{cautious}} and pragmatic approach, the FORA IX grew rapidly. Though figures are generally unreliable, it claimed a membership of 100,000 to 120,000 by 1919. In {{a time of}} economic recession and falling wages, {{as the result of}} World War I, it was more intent on defending past achievements, rather than starting risky struggles. During a railway strike in 1917, the FORA V decided to go on the offensive <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> a general strike, but it was quickly defeated as very few unions participated.|$|E
25|$|By {{the start}} of the 1980s Victorian Railways {{passenger}} numbers had fallen to around 3 million per year, due to ageing rolling stock, stagnant timetables and competition from other forms of transport. The Lonie Report of 1980 recommended cuts to the network, with the general public responding <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> the State Government to maintain a viable rail network. The government response in February 1981 was the New Deal for Country Passengers, a $115 million commitment to recast country rail passenger services in Victoria.|$|E
50|$|The Conservatives {{returned}} to the Opposition benches in 1980. MacDonald served as critic for External Affairs, her old cabinet portfolio.

MacDonald supported Clark in his campaign to regain the leadership, but Clark lost to Brian Mulroney.|$|R

25|$|The {{powers of}} the {{legislature}} are further checked by those of the President, who may veto legislation, both ordinary and constitutional, passed by the legislature. Laws are not promulgated without the signature of the President. A presidential veto can be overridden, but only by an absolute majority of the Seimas' membership. The President can also dissolve the Parliament if it refuses to approve the government's budget within sixty days or if it directly votes no confidence in the government. However, the next elected Parliament may retaliate <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> an earlier presidential election.|$|E

For instance, Hydro-Québec Distribution launched calls for tenders in 2003 and 2005, for 1,000 and 2,000 MW of wind power respectively. Early deliveries started in 2006 and the 23 wind farms under contract should be completely on-line by December 2015.|$|E
25|$|Pentecostals {{believe that}} prayer is central in {{receiving}} healing. Pentecostals look to scriptures such as James 5:13–16 for direction regarding healing prayer.

Verses 14–16 supply the framework for congregational healing prayer.

On 2 March 1989, 12 European Community nations agreed to ban the production of all CFCs {{by the end of the}} century. In 1990, diplomats met in London and voted to significantly strengthen the Montreal Protocol <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> a complete elimination of CFCs by the year 2000.

25|$|Eden {{continued}} to be PPS to Locker-Lampson when the latter was appointed Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office in December 1925.

Eden ended his speech <b>by</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> Anglo-Turkish friendship. On 23 March 1926 he spoke urging the League of Nations to admit Germany, which would happen the following year. In July 1926 he became PPS to the Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain.|$|E
