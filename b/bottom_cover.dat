50|$|Inhalation {{closes the}} {{mouthpiece}} exhalation non-return valve and draws gas through the inhalation non-return valve. The pressure drop draws {{the contents of}} the outer bellows through the scrubber, inhalation hose, non-return valve and mouthpiece to the diver. As the concentric bellows contract, the pressure in the inner bellows increases and first closes the internal non-return valve, then pushes its contents through the outer non-return valve, discharging to the surroundings.When the bellows is fully contracted, the <b>bottom</b> <b>cover</b> triggers the gas addition valves which inject gas until the diver stops inhaling and the <b>bottom</b> <b>cover</b> no longer presses against the addition valve actuator.If the gas in the breathing circuit has been compressed by an increase in depth, the gas volume will be even less and the addition valves will be triggered for longer, bringing the volume back to the appropriate level. The RB80 uses two addition valves in parallel, so that if one fails, the other will provide the required gas.|$|E

50|$|Each IBM 1316 Disk Pack is 4 in high, weighs 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and {{contains}} six 14 in diameter disks, yielding 10 recording surfaces (the outer surfaces are not used). The 10 individual read/write heads are {{mounted on a}} common actuator within the disk drive which moves in and out hydraulically and mechanically detented at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. The disks spin at 1500 rpm. Each recording surface has 100 tracks with 20 sectors per track. Each sector stores 100 characters. The disk pack {{is covered with a}} clear plastic shell and a <b>bottom</b> <b>cover</b> when not in use. A lifting handle in the top center of the cover is rotated to release the <b>bottom</b> <b>cover.</b> Then the top of the 1311 drive is opened and the plastic shell lowered into the disk-drive opening (assuming it is empty). The handle is turned again to lock the disks in place and release the plastic shell, which is then removed and the drive cover closed. The process is reversed to remove a disk pack. The same methods are used for many later disk packs.|$|E
5000|$|Pecha (...) is a Tibetan {{word meaning}} [...] "book", but in particular, {{refers to the}} {{traditional}} Tibetan loose-leaf books such as the kangyur, tengyur, and sadhanas. Pechas sometimes have top and <b>bottom</b> <b>cover</b> plates made of wood, cardboard, or other firm materials, and are often seen wrapped in cloth for protection. The word pecha has entered common use in other languages such as English in the Tibetan Buddhist community, evident online [...] in discussion forums and software products that include the word in their names.|$|E

50|$|The counterlung is a {{wedge shaped}} bellows, hinged {{on the lower}} edge, and the angle between the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>covers</b> is {{proportional}} to the internal volume. The change in top plate angle, as the diver breathes, controls the gas addition mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The three inner girders are {{conventional}} being 0.76m {{deep and}} built up {{of a web}} plate, four angles and top and <b>bottom</b> <b>cover</b> plates. The outer girders are less conventional, with the angles n {{one side of the}} web left off to provide a flush face. The 5/16 inch (a standard recommendation in the early twentieth century) web plates are fastened with 8 rivets to the 100 x 75 x 9.5 mm vertical angles. The horizontal angles are 100 x 75 x 16 mm and secured with an additional 13 or 14 rivets per web plate. Corners are bolted through with 28 mm bolts.|$|E
50|$|The belt {{consists}} {{of one or}} more layers of material. It is common for belts to have three layers: a top cover, a carcass and a <b>bottom</b> <b>cover.</b> The purpose of the carcass is to provide linear strength and shape. The carcass is often a woven or metal fabric having a warp & weft. The warp refers to longitudinal cords which characteristics of resistance and elasticity define the running properties of the belt. The weft represents the whole set of transversal cables allowing to the belt specific resistance against cuts, tears and impacts {{and at the same time}} high flexibility. The most common carcass materials are steel, polyester, nylon, cotton and aramid. The covers are usually various rubber or plastic compounds specified by use of the belt.|$|E
50|$|Coverstitch {{is formed}} {{by two or}} more needles {{and one or two}} loopers. Like {{lockstitch}} and chainstitch, coverstitch can be formed anywhere on the material being sewn. One looper manipulates a thread below the material being sewn, forming a <b>bottom</b> <b>cover</b> stitch against the needle threads. An additional looper above the material can form a top cover stitch simultaneously. The needle threads form parallel rows, while the looper threads cross back and forth all the needle rows. Coverstitch is so-called because the grid of crossing needle and looper threads covers raw seam edges, much as the overlock stitch does. It is widely used in garment construction, particularly for attaching trims and flat seaming where the raw edges can be finished in the same operation as forming the seam.|$|E

50|$|The {{protective}} cover {{consisted of two}} parts, a clear plastic shell, with a handle in the center, that enclosed the top and sides of the disks and a separate bottom that completed the sealed package. To remove the disk pack, the drive would be taken off line and allowed to spin down. Its access door could then be opened and an empty top shell inserted and twisted to unlock the disk platter from the drive and secure {{it to the top}} shell. The assembly would then be lifted out and the <b>bottom</b> <b>cover</b> attached. A different disk pack could then be inserted by removing the bottom and placing the disk pack with its top shell into the drive. Turning the handle would lock the disk pack in place and free the top shell for removal.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, the Nikon F2 was introduced. It {{had a more}} {{streamlined}} body, {{a better}} mirror-locking system, a top shutter speed of 1/2000 of a second and was introduced with its own proprietary, continually improving Photomic meter prism heads. This camera was constructed mechanically superior to the F, with some models using titanium for the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>cover</b> plates, and featured slower shutter speeds via the self-timer mechanism. All Nikon F and F2 Photomic prism heads coupled to the shutter speed dial of the respective camera, and also to the aperture ring via a coupling prong on the diaphragm ring of the lens. This design feature was incorporated into most Auto Nikkor lenses of that time. Nikon technicians can still install a coupling prong on D type Auto Nikkor lenses so that these newer lenses will fully couple and operate with the older Nikon camera bodies. This is not possible with the G type Auto Nikkor lenses and lenses with the DX designation.|$|E
40|$|The {{indentation}} {{rolling resistance}} of a belt conveyor {{is influenced by}} a number of design parameters. These typically include the idler roll diameter, belt speed, normal load, <b>bottom</b> <b>cover</b> thickness and viscoelastic properties of the <b>bottom</b> <b>cover</b> compound. In most cases, when analysing the indentation rolling resistance the <b>bottom</b> <b>cover</b> is assumed to be of uniform thickness bonded to a rigid substrate with no consideration of the carcass properties. This paper investigates the influence of the conveyor belt carcass on the resulting stress distribution throughout the belt and subsequently predicts the influence on the indentation rolling resistance...|$|E
50|$|It {{ranges from}} {{shallows}} to depths of about 20m, {{but it is}} most common between 1 - 10m. It prefers sandy <b>bottoms</b> <b>covered</b> with various vegetation and smaller rocks where it can find its food and protection from predators like larger eels, European sea bass, Common dentex and similar predatory species.|$|R
50|$|Slightly {{further south}} is Santa Rosa. The dive {{starts with a}} sandy <b>bottom</b> <b>covered</b> in soft corals, leading to a {{drop-off}} at 15m, descending to 50m. There is a good variety of reef fish in the shallows here, while further down are fusiliers, catfish, jacks, snappers and sweetlips, among others.|$|R
5000|$|Except for its depth, {{the blanket}} of foraminiferal ooze, which likely covers the Zenith Plateau, {{provides}} {{an environment that}} should be helpful for searching for any aircraft wreckage lying on the ocean bottom. According to William Sager, a professor of marine geophysics at the University of Houston in Texas, the surface of ocean <b>bottom</b> <b>covered</b> with foraminiferal ooze is soft enough to squeeze between a person's toes, but it's not so soft that airplane wreckage would sink into it. He stated: [...] "Something big like pieces of an airplane, it's {{going to be sitting}} on the surface." [...] In addition, Robin Beaman, a marine geologist at James Cook University, Queensland, Australia, noted that any large metallic object lying on an ocean <b>bottom</b> <b>covered</b> by foraminiferal ooze would be readily recognizable on an autonomous underwater vehicle's sidescan sonar. Sidescan sonar can be quite good at differentiating the acoustic return of a hard, metallic object compared to that of an ocean floor covered by ooze.|$|R
