5|$|A {{conceptual}} design for another lake lander was proposed in late 2012 by the Spanish-based private engineering firm SENER and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid. The concept probe is called Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE). The major difference {{compared to the}} TiME probe would be that TALISE is envisioned with its own propulsion system and would therefore not <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> simply drifting on the lake when it splashes down.|$|E
5|$|Achebe's first central female {{character}} in a novel is Beatrice Nwanyibuife in Anthills of the Savannah. As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, and slowly learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power. Although {{the final stages of}} the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should not <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> such capacities.|$|E
5|$|Among non-primates, the extinct Chriacus {{exhibits}} microscopic groves on its toothcomb, but the Philippine colugo (Cynocephalus volans) does not. The toothcomb of the colugos {{is generally}} considered {{to function as a}} toothcomb, but {{due to the lack of}} striations on the teeth and no documented observations of toothcomb use during oral grooming, its use seems to <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> food procurement.|$|E

5|$|In April 2013 the Ministry of Defence {{announced}} {{a proposal to}} increase the number of private flights from 7,000 to 12,000 per year as part of plans to increase the income generated by the airfield. The number of flights would <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> 40 per day, and the increase would be phased in over three years to 2016. The airfield was mostly used for VIP jets, with about 3,800 miilitary flights a year.|$|E
5|$|In a 2012 {{review of}} {{pinniped}} taxonomy, Berta and Morgan Churchill suggested that, based on morphological and genetic criteria, there are 33 extant species and 29 subspecies of pinnipeds, although {{five of the}} latter lack sufficient support to be conclusively considered subspecies. They recommend that the genus Arctocephalus <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> Arctocephalus pusillus, and they resurrected the name Arctophoca for several species and subspecies formerly placed in Arctocephalus. More than 50 fossil species have been described.|$|E

5|$|It was {{believed}} that selective pressure, controlled by Washington, combined with diplomatic overtures, would prevail and compel Hanoi to end its aggression.

5|$|After {{almost six}} months of wrangling, the {{question}} of apportionment was brought up for a vote. The compromise was to apportion the House of Delegates on the white population basis, giving the western counties a majority, but for the Senate to be apportioned on a modified mixed basis of population and property including slaves, giving the eastern counties a majority. In the remaining two months of the Convention, it was agreed to allow direct popular election of the governor, but each office holder would <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> one term. Constitutional provision for public education was voted down. Voting by secret ballot was rejected, perpetuating viva voce voting.|$|E
5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists of words that young children {{should be able to}} read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E

5|$|Bede wrote Ecgbert {{a letter}} dealing with monastic {{issues as well}} as the {{problems}} of large dioceses. The letter, written in 734, became known as the Epistola ad Ecgberhtum episcopum. Bede urged Ecgbert to study Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and held up Aidan and Cuthbert as examples of model bishops. The main thrust of Bede's letter was to urge Ecgbert to reform his church to more closely resemble Gregory the Great's original plan for it. Bede's admonition to divide up dioceses fell on deaf ears, as Egbert did not break up his large diocese. The suffragans continued to <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> the bishops of Hexham, Lindisfarne, and Whithorn.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the debut}} of women's ski jumping at these championships, the big winner in the jumping events was Austria with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl and Gregor Schlierenzauer. Adding the 10km mass start, the Nordic {{combined}} format was changed from 7.5km sprint and 15km individual Gundersen to 10km individual large hill (aka Large hill Gundersen) and 10km individual normal hill (aka Normal hill Gundersen), respectively. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men's 15km event. Despite concern over the lack of snowfall that plagued event preparation prior to the championships, the championships themselves had an abundance of snowfall and wind that caused the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined mass start to be postponed {{for a day and}} the ski jumping individual large hill competition to <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> one jump.|$|E
5|$|In January 1893, Palmer {{approached}} the House Appropriations Committee, asking that $10,000 {{of the funds}} already designated to be paid over to the Lady Managers {{by the federal government}} be in the form of souvenir quarters, which they could sell at a premium. On March 3, 1893, Congress duly passed an act authorising the souvenir coin, which was to be to the specifications of the quarter struck for circulation, and with a design to be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. Total mintage of the special quarter would <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> 40,000 specimens.|$|E

5|$|In the 4th century, {{as during}} the Principate, these forces were {{organised}} into ill-defined units based on a single ethnic group called numeri ("troops", although numerus was also {{the name of a}} regular infantry unit). They served alongside the regular army for the duration of particular campaigns or for a specified period. Normally their service would <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> the region where the tribe lived, but sometimes could be deployed elsewhere. They were commanded by their own leaders. It is unclear whether they used their own weapons and armour or the standard equipment of the Roman army. In the late army, the more useful and long-serving numeri appear to have been absorbed into the regular late army, rapidly becoming indistinguishable from other units.|$|E
5|$|Like its sibling V-Bombers, the Victor {{made use}} of the Navigational and Bombing System (NBS); a little-used optical sight had also been {{installed}} upon early aircraft. For navigation and bomb-aiming purposes, the Victor employed numerous radar systems. These included the H2S radar, the first airborne ground-scanning radar, and the Green Satin radar. Radar information was inputted into the onboard electromechanical analogue bomb-aiming apparatus. Some of the navigation and targeting equipment was either directly descended from, or shared concepts with, those used on Handley Page's preceding Halifax bomber. Operationally, {{the accuracy of the}} bomb-aiming system proved to <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> roughly 400 yards, which was deemed sufficient for high-level nuclear strike operations.|$|E
5|$|Michigan won the 1901 game, 21–0, at Ohio Field in Columbus, Ohio, {{in front}} of a crowd of {{approximately}} 4,000 persons. A special train carried 375 Michigan students to the game on the Ann Arbor and Hocking Valley railroads. Ohio State held the Wolverines to their lowest point total of the 1901 season. Prior to the game, the head coaches argued over the length of the game, Yost insisting on regulation halves of 30 minute and Ohio State's John B. Eckstorm insisting that the first half <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> 25 minutes. When the umpire threatened Ohio State with a forfeiture, coach Eckstrom agreed to play regulation halves of 30 minutes.|$|E
