40|$|Wireless {{networks}} present unusual {{challenges for}} mobile file system clients, {{since they are}} characterised by unpredictable connectivity and widely-varying bandwidth. The traditional approach to adapting network communication to these conditions is to write <b>back</b> <b>file</b> updates asynchronously when bandwidth is low. Unfortunately, {{this can lead to}} underutilisation of bandwidth and inconsistencies between clients. We describe a new mobile file system, MAFS, that supports graceful degradation of file system performance as bandwidth is reduced, as well as rapid propagation of essential file updates. MAFS is able to achieve 10 - 20 % improvements in execution time for real-life file system traces featuring read-write contention. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInfrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud {{computing}} is gaining significant interest in industry and academia {{as an alternative}} platform for running HPC applications. Given {{the need to provide}} fault tolerance, support for suspend-resume and offline migration, an efficient Checkpoint-Restart mechanism becomes paramount in this context. We propose BlobCR, a dedicated checkpoint repository that is able to take live incremental snapshots of the whole disk attached to the virtual machine (VM) instances. BlobCR aims to minimize the performance overhead of checkpointing by persisting VM disk snapshots asynchronously in the background using a low overhead technique we call selective copy-on-write. It includes support for both application-level and process-level checkpointing, as well as support to roll <b>back</b> <b>file</b> system changes. Experiments at large scale demonstrate the benefits of our proposal both in synthetic settings and for a real-life HPC application...|$|E

40|$|Electronic theses and {{dissertation}} are {{the topic}} of the ETD, but what about all the theses, which are not yet electronically published and only available on paper or even worse on microfilm? As the manufacturer of the Bookeye® family of scanners we {{have had a lot of}} discussions with libraries and their needs. One topic was the gap between the increasing demand for electronic availability of documents like dissertations and theses and their real availability on paper or microfilm. To close this gap - besides others like electronic document delivery via ILL and/or an alternative to ARIEL - we were asked to develop an open WEB-based system together with librarians. The development guidelines were a browser-based user interface, usage of PHP, Apache, MySQL, and the system should run on Windows and Linux. The result was Mybib, a platform to cover: * electronic document delivery * scan on demand applications, as an alternative to scanning entire stocks * <b>back</b> <b>file</b> conversion to supply extended OPAC´s Requests for documents to be scanned and delivered can be issued to Mybib by any library system, OPAC or free style WEB-form via ILL, XML or E-Mail. The whole process from the incoming request, through scanning to the delivery is cov-ered by Mybib. Modules for tracking, billing, claim handling, statistics and others support the management and supervisor of the library. MyBib is scalable from one to many scanning, operation and management workplaces. It covers the needs of big libraries located in one place, as well as libraries with departments located in different places. And all of them can be supervised from one place anywhere in the world via Internet or VPN with a Browser To get theses and documents from paper/microfilm to a digital form, they have to be scanned, which is realized by the My-Bib Scan-client. It covers overhead-, flatbed-, autofeed- and microfilm- scanners as well as digital copier systems from RICOH, CANON and others, which can be used as scanner and printer. And if the scanner supports color or formats up to A 1 (34 " by 22 "), Mybib supports it too. Last, but not least there is the question of intellectual property rights. To help protect these rights, the electronic endorser in Mybib imprints a digital watermark as proof of information supplier or copyright remarks with time stamp in the delivered documents...|$|E
40|$|The {{extensive}} IPC reform {{project of}} the last few years has led to many major changes. In this article the author concentrates on three vital aspects of the implementation of the reformed International Patent Classification (IPC) [...] the Master Classification Database (MCD), the CONcept of OPerationS (CONOPS), and the HARMONY {{project of the}} Trilateral Offices. The MCD is based on the EPO's DOCDB system. The CONOPS document describes the classification and reclassification process of the reformed IPC in sufficient detail to enable all industrial property offices to implement and use the reformed classification system. It covers topics such as patent families, <b>back</b> <b>files,</b> newly published documents, and revision of the advanced level.
