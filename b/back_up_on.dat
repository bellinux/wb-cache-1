25|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{fitted with}} a retractable tricycle undercarriage with steerable nosewheels, allowing a fairly large crab angle during cross-wind landing. The reverse pitch control with which the aircraft is fitted allows the constant-speed mechanism to be manually overridden to reverse the blade pitch angle, thus providing excellent ground-handling characteristics, helping {{to slow down the}} plane to shorten the landing run. This control also allows the aircraft to <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> its own during taxiing.|$|E
25|$|The second box is Step 1, {{which is}} the {{oxidation}} of the alpha-C (C#2). Oxidation {{is the first step}} that isocitrate goes through. In this process, the alcohol group off the alpha-carbon (C#2) is deprotonated and the electrons flow to the alpha-C forming a ketone group and removing a hydride off C#2 using NAD+/NADP+ as an electron accepting cofactor. The oxidation of the alpha-C allows for a position where electrons (in the next step) will be coming down from the carboxyl group and pushing the electrons (making the double bonded oxygen) <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the oxygen or grabbing a nearby proton off a nearby Lysine amino acid.|$|E
500|$|Thistle's {{fortunes}} on {{the pitch}} declined during the 1980s. Although the club had experienced difficult times before, having {{dropped into the}} second tier of Scottish football twice in the 1970s, they had bounced straight <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> both occasions. The relegation of 1982 led to the Club's first sustained period outside the top tier since the late 19th century. Although this period of exile ended with promotion in 1992, mounting financial problems, including a debt of over £1.5million, threatened to put the club out of existence. In 1998 in particular the club was close to going bankrupt and was only kept afloat by the fan-organised [...] "Save the Jags" [...] campaign. Despite avoiding financial oblivion Thistle were relegated to the third tier of Scottish Football in 1997–98 and only narrowly avoided a further relegation the following season, finishing in eighth place.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, {{the school}} began to remove {{asbestos}} {{from the walls}} and ceilings of the school, and added an elevator - luckily - apparently, the old {{part of the school}} was built on dirt, with no foundation beneath, so before the elevator was installed by Delta Elevators, a foundation was poured. [...] The construction is finally over and the artworks are going <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the walls. [...] Another new piece of information is that the school has bought a piece of land across the street, formerly the Elmira Raceway, and now has a new sports field including a new track and field facility. There is also a large scoreboard at the new field.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stability}} of the DDG-1000 hull design in heavy seas has {{been a matter of}} controversy. In April 2007, naval architect Ken Brower said, [...] "As a ship pitches and heaves at sea, if you have tumblehome instead of a flare, you have no righting energy to make the ship come <b>back</b> <b>up.</b> <b>On</b> the DDG 1000, with the waves coming at you from behind, when a ship pitches down, it can lose transverse stability as the stern comes out of the water – and basically, roll over." [...] The decision to not use a tumblehome hull in the CG(X) cruiser, before the program was canceled, may suggest that there were concerns regarding Zumwalts seakeeping. However, in a 1/4 scale test of the hull design, named Sea Jet, the tumblehome hull proved seaworthy.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{concerns}} {{began to}} grow about the stability of Zumwalts hull. [...] Naval architect Ken Brower said in April 2007 that [...] "as a ship pitches and heaves at sea, if you have tumblehome instead of flare, you have no righting energy to make the ship come <b>back</b> <b>up.</b> <b>On</b> the , with the waves coming at you from behind, when a ship pitches down, it can lose transverse stability as the stern {{comes out of the}} water - and basically roll over." [...] There were also doubts whether the Zumwalt hull was big enough to accommodate ballistic defense weapons, and a possible nuclear propulsion system. In July 2007 came the first suggestions that the AOA might recommend a two-class solution, a 14,000ton [...] "escort cruiser" [...] based on the Zumwalts stealthy [...] "tumblehome" [...] hull, and a ballistic missile defense ship of 23,000tons. The latter would use a more conventional shape than the tumblehome, as its use of radars to search for missiles while on station would make a stealthy hull pointless. In July 2008, Roscoe Bartlett of the House Seapower subcommittee stated that it was [...] "unlikely the [...] hull could be used in the CG(X) program".|$|E
2500|$|The men of {{the convoy}} then began {{launching}} boats to pick up Japanese survivors and kill all of the remaining prisoners. A machine gun mounted on the grounded cargo ship and a second on the Shinyō Maru were also opened up on the Allied personnel. Marine Corps Sergeant Onnie Clem later reported the following; [...] "Up on the bridge there was a machine gun spraying the hatch. A burst of machine-gun fire caught {{all three of us}} and knocked us back down in the hold. We'd all been hit. I got plowed in the skull. Another bullet chipped out my chin. Nevertheless, I was able to work myself <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> deck, and I was eyeing that bridge when I came out that time. The gun was still there, but the gunner was laying out on deck. Somebody had apparently got up there and killed him. At this time I found out that we were out in the ocean about two or three miles from shore. All I had was a loincloth." [...] Fifteen or 20 others were recaptured and taken aboard one of the torpedo boats, where they were executed by firing squad as punishment for trying to escape. One of those men was able to free his hands which had been tied behind his back, and he successfully escaped by jumping overboard again. The Japanese dropped 45 depth charges and other explosives on the American submarine over the course of two hours, and the ship sustained some light damage, but nobody was hurt. After that, she surfaced and began patrolling the area again.|$|E
2500|$|To {{protect against}} defilement from {{contact with the}} dead, they built courtyards over bedrock, and left beneath them a hollow to serve as {{protection}} against a grave in the depths. They used to bring pregnant women there to give birth and rear their children in this ritually pure place. They placed doors {{on the backs of}} oxen and placed the children upon them with stone cups in their hands. When the children reached the pool of Siloam, the children stepped down, filled the cups with water, and then climbed <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the doors. Rabbi Jose said that each child used to let down his cup and fill it from on top of the oxen. When the children arrived at the Temple Mount with the water, they got down. Beneath the Temple Mount and the Temple courtyards was a hollow, which protected against contamination from a grave in the depths. At the entrance of the court of the women, they kept a jar of the ashes of the sin-offerings. If they did not find the residue of the ashes of seven Red Cows, they performed the sprinkling with those of six, of five, of four, of three, of two or of one. They made a causeway from the Temple Mount to the Mount of Olives, arches above arches, each arch placed directly above each pier of the arch below, as a protection against a grave in the depths, on which the priest who was to burn the cow, the cow itself, and all who aided in its preparation went forth to the Mount of Olives. If the cow refused to go out, they did not take out with it a black cow, lest it be said that they killed a black cow instead of a Red Cow. Nor did they bring out another Red Cow, lest it be said that they killed two Red Cows. But Rabbi Jose said it was not for this reason, but because [...] says, [...] "And he shall bring her forth," [...] implying: by herself.|$|E
