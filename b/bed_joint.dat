40|$|Layered limestones with marly-clayey interbeds are {{widespread}} in mountain regions. Where tectonics {{has not changed}} the original structure they frequently form homocline slopes, that since the last deglaciation have evolved through planar block slides along <b>bedding</b> <b>joints.</b> A typical dip slope showing this evolution {{is represented by the}} left flank of the Adige River valley south of Rovereto (North-Eastern Italy). Even though layers never daylight at the slope toe, the exceptional persistence and weakness of <b>bedding</b> <b>joints</b> allows buckling of layers, which occasionally collapse causing rock avalanches. Before monitoring started, deformations were believed to be no longer active, this conviction being strengthened by the high safety factors provided by limit equilibrium analyses. SAR satellite interferometry performed between 1990 and 2002 and probe inclinometer measures indicate that the slabs located uphill from the buckle folds are slowly sliding. Since some doubts have been raised about rock mass behaviour, slope geometry and hydraulic conditions assumed in the analyses, buckling was back-analysed using the Distinct Element Method (DEM) and the Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA). These treat the rock mass as a discontinuum and account for deformation and failure of the rock material. To perform numerical analyses, rock mass structure, strength and stiffness were determined through extensive in situ and laboratory investigations. For this purpose field surveys, borehole core logging and geophysical surveys were performed and laboratory geotechnical tests on the rock material, clayey interbeds and <b>bedding</b> <b>joints</b> were conducted. Discontinuous analyses confirmed that buckling deformations are definitely possible if some conditions are present (high water pressure, minor flexures). Modelling also indicate that buckling deformations may evolve into failures and should therefore be taken into account in evaluating long term stability of the slope. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Clay brick facades {{often include}} <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> reinforcement, {{especially}} over windows and other {{openings in the}} façade, which may corrode due to degradation from climatic exposure. Removal of corroded <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> reinforcement from such facades is an invasive and costly measure. Heavily damaged reinforcement must be removed for either structural, durability or aesthetic reasons. Parts of the <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> reinforcement can however {{be left in the}} façade, if it can be shown that the risk for future damage is acceptably low. This will significantly reduce the amount of work needed and the retrofitting costs. A dose-response model for prediction of corrosion induced cracking in reinforced brick masonry is presented, with relative humidity, temperature and oxygen supply {{in the vicinity of the}} reinforcement as influencing parameters. Corrosion depth, constituting the dose, is modelled by integration of the effect of corrosion rate with respect to time. To describe the dependence of corrosion rate on the influencing parameters, models from the field of concrete research are used. The response, which can be seen as a limit state, is the corrosion depth required to create a crack due to tensile stresses generated by corrosion products. Due to scarcity of experimental data from the field of reinforced brick masonry, the critical corrosion depth is established using empirical data from the field of concrete research. To address this lack of a well-defined limit state, tests will be performed on clay brick specimens in a later part of the research project.

The infill walls are typically connected to the RC frame with cast-in-place dowel reinforcement along one or more edges of the wall. There is limited guidance in masonry codes to design these types of structures, and their seismic performance has not been characterized with experimental tests. In this work, an experimental program characterized the seismic behavior of hybrid concrete-masonry frames and showed they do not exhibit the typical strut mechanism observed in unreinforced masonry infill structures.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{bricks and mortar}} {{could be used in}} a chaotic environment where brick and joints sizes could be varied to achieve better outcomes (such as cost minimisation) through an understanding of mortar consumption characteristics of brickwork. This was made possible by integrating three innovative concepts, viz. 'type' of wall, 'cost polarity', and 'bricks to mortar' ratio. New formulae for computing mortar volumes had to be developed as the simple formula of subtracting the volume of bricks from the volume of wall that did not produce accurate mortar volumes. Having validated these formulae, mortar volumes in different joints were computed. Accordingly, {{it was found that the}} bed-joint accounted for the largest portion of mortar in single brick thick walls in English bond, irrespective of the size of brick used. With more than two thirds of the total volume of mortar in the <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> (even with a smaller <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> of 10 mm), it plays a significant role in changing the volume of mortar in brickwork. As the volume of mortar in the study walls was as high as 73 % when compared with (less than) 25 % for walls with standard brick and joint sizes, the very notion of what 'brick-work' was challenged. This led to the identification of three 'types' of walls, namely, 'mortar-wall' (with volume of mortar over 50 %), 'brick-mortar wall' (with volumes of mortar between 25 - 50 %), and 'brick-wall' (with a volume less than 25 %) with corresponding 'bricks to mortar' ratios of less than 1, 1 to 3, and greater than 3. This classification was used for specifying a 'type' of wall. It was found that 'brick to mortar' ratio was quite sensitive to variations in small values of the <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> when large bricks were used though this was not the case with smaller bricks and larger bed joints. This suggests the importance of controlling workmanship if the ratio is to be maintained at small values of <b>bed</b> <b>joint.</b> A strategy-map for selecting a desirable 'bricks to mortar ratio' was provided based on 'type' of wall, brick and joint sizes, and degree of control required for ensuring workmanship. In order to make strategic decisions on costs, the concept of 'cost polarity' (cost of density of bricks to mortar) was used. Accordingly, a cost-efficient 'type' of wall could be selected based on whether cost polarity was less than 1 or greater using a strategy-map for such decision making. Further savings in costs could be achieved by using the strategy-map for 'brick to mortar' ratios whilst giving consideration to the build ability of the <b>bed</b> <b>joint,</b> and sizes of other joints including joint fullness. The framework thus proposed provides a fresh perspective on how walls built with bricks and mortar could be managed (particularly in Sri Lanka) with potential for enormous cost savings using a chaotic environment to bring a new order. ...|$|E
40|$|Determination of shear {{strength}} of brick-mortar <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> {{is critical to}} overcome the sliding-shear or joint-shear failure in masonry. In the recent past, researchers have attempted to enhance the {{shear strength}} and deformation capacity of brick-mortar bed joints by gluing fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite across the <b>bed</b> <b>joint.</b> FRP composites offer several advantages like high strength-to-weight ratio, and ease of application in terms of labor, time, and reduced curing period. Furthermore, FRP composites are desirable for strengthening old masonry buildings having heritage value because of its minimal interference with the existing architecture. A majority of earlier studies on shear strengthening of masonry available in the literature adopted masonry having the ratio of modulus of elasticity of masonry unit (Emu) to modulus of elasticity of mortar (Em) greater than one. Information related to shear behavior of FRP glued masonry composed of masonry units having Young's modulus lower than mortar is limited. Hence {{the present study is}} focused on characterizing the interfacial behavior of brick-mortar <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> of masonry assemblages composed of solid burnt clay bricks and cement-sand mortar (E-mu/E-m ratio less than one), strengthened with FRP composites. Masonry triplets and prisms with <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> inclined to loading axis (0 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees) are employed in this study. Glass and carbon FRP composites composed of bidirectional FRP fabric with equal density in both directions are used for strengthening masonry. Masonry triplets are glued with glass and carbon FRP composites in two configurations: (1) both faces of the triplet specimens are fully glued with GFRP composites; and (2) both faces of the triplet specimens are glued with GFRP and CFRP composites in strip form. The performance of masonry assemblages strengthened with FRP composites is assessed in terms of gain in shear strength, shear displacement, and postpeak behavior for various configurations and types of FRP composites considered. A semianalytical model is proposed for the prediction of shear strength of masonry bed joints glued with FRP composites.
