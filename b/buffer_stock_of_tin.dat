Since these activities often bring new risks, an understanding of cropland decisions and how these interact with shocks is valuable. This paper uses data from Mozambique to examine the effect of weather shocks on cropland decisions. We account for the bounded nature of land shares and estimate a Pooled Fractional Probit model for panel data. Our results show that crop choice is sensitive to past weather shocks. Farmers shift land use away from cash and permanent crops one year after a drought and from horticulture and permanent crop after a flood.

40|$|Most OECD economies have {{suffered}} from persistently high unemployment since the mid- 1970 s {{as a result of}} demand deficiencies promoted by inappropriate fiscal and monetary policy. Governments have failed to understand the opportunities that they have as the issuer of the currency. In this paper, a framework for analysing these opportunities is presented. We compare two buffer-stock means of stabilising the price level: (a) the NAIRU approach, which uses a <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> unemployed; and (b) the Job Guarantee, which is an open ended, fixed wage <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> employed workers. The government offers a fixed wage to anyone willing and able to work, and allows market forces to determine the total quantity of government spending. This option is available to the government as the monopoly issuer of fiat currency. We show that budget deficits are necessary to maintain full employment if the private sector is to pay taxes and has a positive desire to net save. In this regard, the orthodox treatment of the accounting relation termed the government budget constraint as an ex ante financial constraint is in error. We show that government spending is only constrained by what real goods and services are offered in return for it. There is no financing requirement. Debt issuance is seen as part of a reserve maintenance operation by the RBA consistent with their monetary policy cash rate targets. "The political revival of free-market ideology in the 1980 s is, I presume, based on the market's remarkable ability to root out inefficiency. But not all inefficiencies are created equal. In particular, high unemployment represents a waste of resources so colossal that no one truly interested in efficiency can be complacent abut it.

We instrument the type of contract using regional variation in the amount, timing and target groups of subsidies given to fi rms to hire workers using high severance payment ones.

This paper studies the choice between fixed-rate (FRM) and adjustable-rate (ARM) mortgages. In an environment with uncertain inflation, nominal FRMs have risky real capital value whereas ARMs have safe capital value. However ARMs can greatly increase the short-term variability of required real interest payments. This is a serious disadvantage of ARMs for households who face borrowing constraints and have only a small <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> financial assets. The paper uses numerical methods to solve a life-cycle model with risky labor income and borrowing constraints, under alternative assumptions about available mortgage contracts. Households with large mortgages, risky labor income, high risk aversion, and a low probability of moving {{are more likely to}} prefer nominal FRMs. The paper also considers inflation-indexed FRMs. These mortgages remove the wealth risk of nominal FRMs without incurring the income risk of ARMs, and therefore are a superior vehicle for household risk management.

Since expansion has not proven sufficient to remedy this intolerably high level of wasted human resources, well-targeted, active labor market policies are required. One such policy is a job opportunity program that "hires off the bottom," providing minimum-wage jobs for all those who are ready, willing, and able to work.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} dynamic theory of {{adjustment}} of labor force to a shock that makes existing human capital stock obsolete. Workers will not {{invest in the}} new, superior skills because their current value depends on the existing complementary <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> human capital, and the obsolete specialized skills are largely incompatible with the new specialized skills. Labor market imperfections make the current distribution of skills {{a factor in the}} decision to invest in new skills. This creates room for generalists, workers with an intermediate set of skills who are able to work with both old and new types. Along the equilibrium path the economy accumulates a <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> generalists that eventually makes it profitable to invest in superior specialization. Instead of focusing on steady states, the paper proposes new methods of studying the short-run adjustment in search models with forward-looking investment. It characterizes the dynamics of transition and analyzes how equilibrium paths differ across countries with diverse labor market and educational institutions. The efficiency analysis allows drawing policy implications. Econometric evidence on labor markets in transition economies is shown to be broadly consistent with predictions of the model. East Germany presents a stark example of rapid transition that is difficult to explain by traditional theories but is consistent with the predictions of my model. ...|$|R
