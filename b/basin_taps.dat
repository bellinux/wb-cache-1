Economic efficiency has recently become one of the primary objectives of water management decisions. In particular, as vulnerability of freshwater systems has become evident and there is a trend for water supply managers to look towards water demand management, identifying the cost of such measures is increasingly becoming important. In England and Wales, Part G of the Building Regulations requires that water consumption of a new dwelling should not be more than 125 litres/capita. day. However, while compliance with this is determined by the water use characteristics of the installed micro-components (WCs, showers, <b>basin</b> <b>taps,</b> kitchen taps, baths, dishwashers and washing machines), the cost to consumers resulting from installing water efficient micro-components is not clear. This paper evaluates the potential economic implications of water saving micro-components, assessed from the consumers’ perspective. A methodology has been developed and implemented to assess the cost effectiveness of several types of water efficient micro-components. A range of cost assessment methods were applied, and critically reviewed comparing their outcomes. It was found that conventional cost assessment methods are unsuitable for identifying the least cost options to consumers. Of the applied methods, the modified annualised 34 assessment method appears to be relatively a better option. The work was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and its support is thankfully acknowledged...|$|E
40|$|PhD, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the WitwatersrandBackground: Dental {{procedures}} {{associated with}} dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) in dental health care settings generate aerosolised droplets {{that have the}} potential to cause adverse health effects in exposed workers. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the risk of work-related asthma associated with endotoxin exposure in dental health care workers. Materials and methods: The study population included dental personnel (n = 454) from 5 academic dental institutions in South Africa. Personal air samples (n = 413) in various dental jobs as well as airborne area and water samples from dental handpieces and <b>basin</b> <b>taps</b> were collected. A self-administered modified European Community Respiratory Health Survey questionnaire was used to obtain information on respiratory symptoms and the occupational history. Serum samples were collected to determine atopic status, specific IgE to composite latex (k 82) extract and 8 recombinant latex proteins, myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), inflammatory cytokines, and endotoxin levels. Spirometry including pre- and post-bronchodilator testing was conducted according to ATS/ERS guidelines. Multivariate linear and logistic regression and factor analysis was used in the data analysis. Results: Airborne endotoxin levels were variable across departments with administration having the lowest and laboratories the highest mean exposures (geometric mean: 2. 38 versus 5. 63 EU/m 3). Job status as a student (compared to staff member) and dental unit characteristics (age, model type, number of units) were important predictors of airborne endotoxin. The most common asthma phenotypes were atopic asthma (6. 9 %), non-atopic asthma (5. 9 %) and work-aggravated asthma (4 %). Four inflammatory groups related to eosinophilic versus neutrophilic inflammation and chronicity of the response were identified. Acute neutrophilic response was associated with work-related chest symptoms (OR = 4. 99, 95 % CI: 1. 32 - 18. 92). Cumulative endotoxin exposures (> 51. 12 EU/m 3 -year) was an important predictor of work-related ocular-nasal symptoms (OR = 3. 82, 95 % CI: 1. 01 – 14. 41) in non-atopic workers. Borderline significant associations were also observed between current airborne endotoxin concentrations (> 5. 83 EU/m 3) and asthma-related symptoms (OR = 2. 24, 95 % CI: 0. 97 – 5. 17) as well as suboptimal lung function (FEV 1 5. 83 EU/m 3) elevated endotoxin levels were at increased risk (OR = 2. 59, 95 % CI: 1. 20 – 5. 60) of presenting with latex sensitisation. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that endotoxin exposures from DUWLs play an important role in the manifestation of non-atopic asthma through the neutrophilic-response mechanism. Neutrophilic inflammatory cell asthma phenotypes coexist with eosinophilic inflammatory cell asthma phenotypes in this group of workers. Furthermore, low-grade elevated endotoxin levels increase the risk of sensitisation to latex among dental workers using latex gloves. This is the first study to demonstrate airway effects associated with low-grade elevated endotoxin exposures in dental settings...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Eocene {{strata of}} the Talara forearc basin of {{northwest}} Peru contain detrital-zircon (DZ) populations that, when integrated with other provenance indicators, record paleogeographic {{shifts in the}} Andean forearc that {{can be linked to}} larger-scale tectonic drivers such as subduction erosion, plate convergence rate, and regional accretion events. Because forearc basins along the western margin of South America are particularly difficult to preserve, the new DZ results provide rare insight into the trench–arc dynamics associated with the Andean orogenic cycle. The Talara <b>basin</b> <b>tapped</b> into both the Andean volcanic arc and older basement, and the DZ populations subsequently reflect long-lived plate interactions and progressive crustal growth along the northwestern edge of Amazonia, Gondwana, and South America. Dominant U–Pb zircon age populations include: 36 – 110 Ma (Andes convergence); 215 – 285 Ma (western Gondwana extension); 460 – 625 Ma (Rodinia extension and western Gondwana convergence); 950 – 1250 Ma (Grenville orogeny); and. 1250 Ma (Amazonia assembly). The data corroborate previous geochronology on pre-Andean basement and support the existence of a Famatinian arc (, 480 Ma) and Carboniferous–Triassic magmatism along northwestern Gondwana. Pre-Andean and Amazonian DZ likely was recycled from Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks of the Andean Cordillera and Amotape terrane, although the data do not preclude delivery of Amazonian detritus directly into the forearc via a large-scale, westward drainage. The Andean DZ population constrains th...|$|R

40|$|The Whitehorse trough is an Early to Middle Jurassic marine {{sedimentary}} basin that overlaps the Intermontane terranes {{in the northern}} Cordillera. Detrital zircon dates from eight Laberge Group sandstones from {{various parts of the}} trough all display a major Late Triassic–Early Jurassic peak (220 – 180 Ma) and a minor peak in the mid-Paleozoic (340 – 330 Ma), corresponding exactly with known igneous ages from areas surrounding the trough. Source regions generally have Early Jurassic (ca. 200 – 180 Ma) mica cooling dates, and the petrology of metamorphic rocks and Early Jurassic granitoid plutons flanking the trough suggests rapid exhumation during emplacement. These data suggest that subsidence and coarse clastic sedimentation in the trough occurred concurrently with rapid exhumation of the shoulders. Isolated occurrences of sandstone and conglomerate units with similar detrital zircon signatures occur west and east of the trough, as well as overlapping the Cache Creek terrane, indicating that either the trough was once more extensive, or isolated <b>basins</b> <b>tapped</b> similar sources. Development of these {{sedimentary basin}}s and accompanying rapid exhumation in the northern Cordillera were coeval with the onset of orogenic activity in the hinterland of the southern Canadian Cordillera, and subsidence in the western Canada foreland sedimentary basin. The Whitehorse trough is interpreted as a forearc basin that progressively evolved into a collisional, synorogenic piggyback basin developed atop the nascent Cordilleran orogen. Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous fluvial deposits overlapping the Whitehorse trough have detrital zircons that were mainly derived from recycling of the Laberge Group, but they also contain zircons exotic to the northern Intermontane terranes that are interpreted to reflect windblown detritus from the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous magmatic arc that developed either atop the approaching Insular terranes to the west or southern Stikinia...|$|R

50|$|Roma was the {{principal}} town of the Mount Abundance district, which was developed as a pastoral and agricultural region following exploration by Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor General of New South Wales in 1846. The township of Roma was proclaimed in September 1862, {{one of the earliest}} towns established in Queensland after separation from New South Wales in 1859, and was surveyed in 1863. It was named after Lady Bowen (the Countess Diamantina Georgina di Roma), daughter of a Governor of the Ionian Islands, and wife of the first Governor of Queensland, Sir George Ferguson Bowen. The town of Roma was declared a municipality in 1867 and grew slowly as a pastoral service centre and government administrative centre until the opening of the Western railway line in the 1880s, connecting the Maranoa to the coastal ports, after which the town flourished. In addition, the vast Great Artesian <b>Basin</b> was <b>tapped</b> in the late 1880s and early 1890s, securing an alternative water supply for cattle and sheep.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of water resources, its availability and use, problems and constraints, {{the present and future}} challenges and the ensuing opportunities in water resource sector {{of one of the most}} populated river basins of the world; the Indus-Gangetic basin. Large-scale development of water resources in the Indus basin has led to the resource base being depleted, both in terms of quantity as well as quality. Well-developed surface irrigation systems in the Indus <b>basin</b> <b>tap</b> most of the surface water available in the basin, leaving only 10 % of the net runoff to the sea, whereas from Ganges basin, the net runoff flowing to the sea is about 40 %. Groundwater, which is expected to serve as buffer source to compensate for the reduced surface water availability, is also getting depleted. Energy and agricultural sector policies followed also favour large scale exploitation of groundwater resources in the basin, which has led to water table decline and a reduction in environmental flows. In the Gangetic part of the basin, it is the economic water scarcity which is more prominent. Equally important is the deterioration of water quality of Ganges river, especially when it flows along the plains accumulating municipal, industrial and domestic waste from the rapidly growing cities situated along its banks. Compounded with these issues is the role played by climate change. Since both Indus and Ganges rivers are heavily dependent on snow and glacier melts, the streamflow in these rivers is highly sensitive to climate change. Recent years have witnessed some responses to the water scarcity problem in IG basin the form of popularization of resource conservation practices, growing high yielding short duration varieties of paddy, micro and precision irrigation, regulations to control groundwater use and management. The article presses the need for water resources in the basin to be managed in a conjunctive manner, considering rain water, surface water, soil water and groundwater in continuum. Considering the inter-linkage between groundwater extraction, energy and food policies, groundwater management strategies should have a focus on energy pricing, food pricing and procurement policies also. Nevertheless, devising long-term strategies on water resource management in the basin need not overlook the likely impacts that the changing climate is going to have on water resources...|$|R

One key aspect of the revision would be to move away from a pure end-of-pipe standard setting approach. Instead the whole water supply process from the <b>basin</b> to the <b>tap</b> would be assessed to identify risk and the most effective control points, through so-called Water safety plans.|$|R
50|$|Bude {{station was}} {{deliberately}} sited {{on the outskirts}} of the town in order to please the residents of Stratton whose, at the time, larger town had been bypassed by the railway company. It was solidly constructed of local stone, with a refreshment room and a large bay-windowed house for the Stationmaster. From the station, a short branch was laid to the canal <b>basin</b> to <b>tap</b> the commercial traffic in sand which was used in construction, as well as to facilitate the distribution of coal which arrived in sloops from South Wales. Although traffic was heavy in the early days, the decline set in during the interwar period with the introduction of chemical fertilisers and competition from road haulage services; freight facilities were eventually withdrawn in 1964, but in reality the station saw very little traffic in its latter years. The station did not see many changes during its 68-year life, but the track layout was modified somewhat in April/May 1939 to accommodate twelve coach trains. Longer trains comprising fifteen coaches or more were handled by dividing the train between the two platforms.|$|R
50|$|Roma was the {{principal}} town of the Mount Abundance district, which was established as a pastoral and agricultural region after exploration by Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor General of New South Wales in 1846. It was originally settled by squatters, who established it as primarily a sheep grazing area. The township of Roma was proclaimed in September 1862, the first town formed in Queensland after its separation from New South Wales in 1859. Roma was named after Lady Diamantina Bowen (née di Roma), wife of the first Governor of Queensland, Sir George Ferguson Bowen. She {{was the daughter of}} a Governor of the Ionian Islands and her maiden name was Countess Diamantina Georgina di Roma. Surveyor McDowall laid out the town reserving a section for public buildings bounded by Bungil, Charles, McDowall and Gregory streets. The first land sales were held in September 1863.

The Reno location was opened in 2010 with the expectation that its added capacity would satisfy demand for the next five years. Great Basin began regular bottling operations in 2011 (holiday releases had previously been available for several years, but on the scale of a few hundred bottles a year) and currently bottles three of their flagship brews. [...] As demand increased further, a third facility was established when Great Basin moved into the warehouse formerly occupied by the defunct Buckbean Brewery. Along with the facility, they also acquired Buckbeans equipment, which was modified to meet Great <b>Basins</b> needs. <b>Taps</b> & Tanks opened to the public at this location in 2012, and a high speed bottling line was installed there the next year - providing capacity to bottle seasonal beers. In 2014, just one year later, Great Basin bottled their millionth beer. [...] Great Basin saw increases in business every year during its first twenty years in operation.

A small portion of the project site is {{situated}} in TRPA’s Crystal Bay Plan Area (PAS 034) (TRPA 2008). Boulder Bay is situated within the Tahoe Area Plan (TAP) (Washoe County 2006). The NSCP and TAP are detailed planning areas within the Washoe County Comprehensive Plan (WCCP) (Washoe County 1994). The Crystal Bay Plan Area is located along Highway 28 between the NSCP area and Incline Village, and contains a low-density residential area. The Crystal Bay Plan Area is considered a sensitive viewshed and high hazard area at risk of avalanche, soil erosion, and slope failure (TRPA 2008). Outdoor recreational opportunities in the 48 -acre NSCP area are limited to the Cal Neva Lodge pool and tennis courts, and the area lacks recreational bicycle and pedestrian trails (TRPA et al. 1996). Placer County recently constructed Class II Bike Lanes on each side of SR 28 that terminate at the Stateline.

40|$|A {{regional}} {{classification of}} shoreline segments along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea Coast was developed {{as the basis}} for quantifying coastal morphology, lithology, and carbon and mineral sediment fluxes. We delineated 48 mainland segments totaling 1, 957 km, as well as 1, 334 km of spits and islands. Mainland coasts were grouped into five broad classes: exposed bluffs (313 km), bays and inlets (235 km), lagoons with barrier islands (546 km), <b>tapped</b> <b>basins</b> (171 km) and deltas (691 km). Sediments are mostly silts and sands, with occasional gravel, and bank heights generally are low (2 – 4 m), especially for deltas (< 1 m). Mean annual erosion rates (MAER) by coastline type vary from 0. 7 m/year (maximum 10. 4 m/year) for lagoons to 2. 4 m/year for exposed bluffs (maximum 16. 7 m/year). MAERs are much higher in silty soils (3. 2 m/year) than in sandy (1. 2 m/year) to gravelly (− 0. 3 m/year) soils. Soil organic carbon along eroding shorelines (deltas excluded) range from 12 to 153 kg/m 2 of bank surface down to the water line. We assume carbon flux out from depositional delta sediments is negligible. Across the entire Alaskan Beaufort Sea Coast, estimated annual carbon input from eroding shorelines ranges from – 47 to 818 Mg/km/year (Metric tones/km/year) across the 48 segments, average 149 Mg/km/year (for 34 nondeltaic segments), and total 1. 8 × 105 Mg/year. Annual mineral input from eroding shorelines ranges from − 1, 863 (accreting) to 15, 752 Mg/km/year, average 2, 743 Mg/km/year, and totals 3. 3 × 106 Mg/year...|$|R
40|$|The igneous {{geochemistry}} of lavas and breccias {{from the}} basement of Sites 790 and 791, and pumice clasts from the Pliocene-Pleistocene sedimentary section of Sites 788, 790, 791, and 793 were studied. Arc volcanism became silicic about 1. 5 m. y. before the inception of rifting in the Sumisu Rift at 2 Ma, but eruption of these silicic magmas reflects changes in stress regime, especially during the last 130, 000 yr, rather than crustal anatexis. Arc magmas have had {{a larger proportion of}} slab-derived components since the inception of rifting than before, but are otherwise similar. Rift basalts and rhyolites are derived from a different source than are arc andesites to rhyolites. The rift source has less slab-derived material and is an E-MORB-like source, in contrast to an N-MORB-type source overprinted with more slab-derived material beneath the arc. Rift magma types, in the form of rare pumice and lithic clasts, preceded the rift, and the earliest magmas that erupted in the rift already differed from those of the arc. The earliest large rift eruption produced an exotic explosion breccia ("mousse") despite eruption at > 1800 mbsl. Although this rock type is attributed primarily to high magmatic water content, the clasts are more MORB-like in trace element and isotopic composition than are modern Mariana Trough basalts. After rifting began, arc volcanism continued to be predominantly silicic, with individual pumice deposits containing clasts that vary in composition by about 5 wt% SiO 2, or about as much as in historical eruptions of submarine Izu Arc volcanoes. The overall variations in magma composition with time during the inception of arc rifting are broadly similar in the Sumisu Rift and Lau <b>Basin,</b> though newly <b>tapped</b> OIB-type mantle seems to be present earlier during basin formation in the Sumisu than Lau case...|$|R

Samples include rocks from the West Philippine Basin, Daito Basin and Benham Rise (40 - 60 m. y.), the Palau-Kyushu Ridge (29 - 44 m. y.) and the Parece Vela and Shikoku basins (17 - 30 m. y.). Samples from the West Philippine, Parece Vela and Shikoku basins are MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) -like with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 7026 - 0. 7032, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd = 0. 51300 - 0. 51315, and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb = 17. 8 - 18. 1. Samples from the Daito Basin and Benham Rise are OIB (oceanic island basalt) -like with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 7038 - 0. 7040, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd = 0. 51285 - 0. 51291 and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb = 18. 8 - 19. 2. All of these rocks have elevated 207 Pb/ 204 Pb and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb {{compared to the}} Northern Hemisphere Regression Line (NHRL) and have delta 207 Pb values of 0 to + 6 and delta 208 Pb values of + 32 to + 65. Lavas from the Palau-Kyushu Ridge, a remnant island arc, have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 7032 - 0. 7035, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd = 0. 51308 - 0. 51310 and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb = 18. 4 - 18. 5. Unlike the basin magmas erupted before and after them, these lavas plot along the NHRL and have Pb-isotope ratios similar to modern Pacific plate MORB's. This characteristic is shared by other Palau-Kyushu Arc volcanic rocks that have been sampled from submerged and subaerial portions of the Mariana fore-arc. At least four geochemically distinct magma sources are required for these Philippine plate magmas. The <b>basin</b> magmas <b>tap</b> Source 1, a MORB-mantle source that was contaminated by EMI (enriched mantle component 1 (Hart, 1988, doi: 10. 1016 / 0012 - 821 X(88) 90131 - 8)) and Source 2, an OIB-like mantle source with some characteristics of EMII (enriched mantle component 2 (Hart, 1988)). The arc lavas are derived from Source 3, a MORB-source or residue mantle including Sr and Pb from the subducted oceanic crust, and Source 4, MORB-source or residue mantle including a component with characteristics of HIMU (mantle component with high U/Pb (Hart, 1988)). These same sources can account {{for many of the}} isotopic characteristics of recent Philippine plate arc and basin lavas.

40|$|Abstract Background Increasingly, {{women in}} India attend health {{facilities}} for childbirth, {{partly due to}} incentives paid under government programs. Increased use of health facilities can alleviate the risks of infections contracted in unhygienic home deliveries, but poor infection control practices in labour and delivery units also cause puerperal sepsis and other infections of childbirth. A needs assessment was conducted to provide information on procedures and practices related to infection control in labour and delivery units in Gujarat state, India. Methods Twenty health care facilities, including private and public primary health centres and referral hospitals, were sampled from two districts in Gujarat state, India. Three pre-tested tools for interviewing and for observation were used. Data collection was based on existing infection control guidelines for clean practices, clean equipment, clean environment and availability of diagnostics and treatment. The study was carried out from April to May 2009. Results Seventy {{percent of respondents said}} that standard infection control procedures were followed, but a written procedure was only available in 5 % of facilities. Alcohol rubs were not used for hand cleaning and surgical gloves were reused in over 70 % of facilities, especially for vaginal examinations in the labour room. Most types of equipment and supplies were available but a third of facilities did not have wash <b>basins</b> with "hands-free" <b>taps.</b> Only 15 % of facilities reported that wiping of surfaces was done immediately after each delivery in labour rooms. Blood culture services were available in 25 % of facilities and antibiotics are widely given to women after normal delivery. A few facilities had data on infections and reported rates of 3 % to 5 %. Conclusions This study of current infection control procedures and practices during labour and delivery in health facilities in Gujarat revealed a need for improved information systems, protocols and procedures, and for training and research. Simply incentivizing the behaviour of women to use health facilities for childbirth via government schemes may not guarantee safe delivery. </p...|$|R
40|$|In Victoria, {{hands free}} wash hand basins in food {{preparation}} areas were a regulatory requirement introduced under the 1984 Health (Eating House and Food Premises) Regulations.

Thirteen premises with manual hand basins and a comparison random sample of 19 premises with hands free basins were selected from the City of Yarra in Melbourne, Australia.

The impact of variables, including the temperature of water supplied to the wash hand basin, number of food handling employees, types of food handled, time the sample was taken and approximate number of meals sold per hour, were also investigated. The results indicated that the mean percentage {{reduction in the number of}} colonies compared for the manual and hands free hand basins showed no significant difference (Manual mean = 58 %, Hands free mean = 79 %, p = 0. 163). Overall, there was large variability in pre and post microbial counts for both basins and considerable variability in the temperature of water to wash hand basins. No clear association, however, was found between the number of employees, temperature of wash hand basin, meals served or use of either facility, with the percentage reduction in the microbial load. The pilot study has indicated that there is no difference between the use of either a manual or hands free wash hand basin for a small group of food retailers. Consideration should be given to a range of factors which might have impacted on this study, including frequency of hand washing, types of foods handled, length of mechanical wash, and number of manual wash hand basins available for the study. Education regarding the need to maintain the temperature of the wash hand basin water between 22 - 40 °C should also be investigated among food retailers as well as strategies for the correct washing of hands...|$|R
