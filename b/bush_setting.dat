This exhibition received a warm response from the Melbourne Herald art critic Allan McCulloch.

50|$|A {{drought in}} the area caused the family to move again, to Norwood. In 1885, the family moved again to a farm {{property}} in Harvey, Western Australia. At age eight, Gibbs was given a pony named Brownie by her father. May enjoyed exploring the bush riding her pony, and began to paint and write about the bush at this time. This period of her childhood, and her imaginative interpretation of the bush, was formative {{in the development of}} the anthropomorphic <b>bush</b> <b>setting</b> found in her work. When Gibbs was 10, the family moved to Perth, where she was educated at Amy Best's girls' school in Perth.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} well known {{projects}} of Bill and Ruth Lucas is the Castlecrag Glasshouse or simply known as [...] "Lucas House". The house is a realization of their idea of an architecture that is 'barely there', or otherwise maintaining their integration with the <b>bush</b> <b>setting.</b> Bill Lucas also {{emphasizes the importance of}} the frame as the main structure of the architecture, 'everything that goes on after that destroys the original structure'. The house was built for their family, constructed with economy in mind. It was designed to function both as a studio and residence but within 5 years had become too small for the expanding Lucas family.|$|E
50|$|The Suttor River Causeway, {{which is}} subject to flooding, is likely {{constructed}} of locally sourced stone. As the river is braided the causeway is in two sections, the southern section being longer and more intact than the northern. Flooding has dislodged some of the stonework, especially on the northern section. Two later concrete tyre tracks have been laid over the stone surface of the southern section, to accommodate motor vehicles. Timber posts remain on the downstream side of the crossing with an additional post on the upstream west side, possibly providing guidance during flooding. The causeway is flanked by indigenous Melaleuca sp. and Eucalyptus sp. and has an aesthetic value generated by the rustic materials and the <b>bush</b> <b>setting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chauncy {{was born}} Nancen Beryl Masterman in Northwood, Middlesex (now in London), and emigrated to Tasmania, Australia, {{with her family}} in 1912, when her {{engineer}} father was offered {{a job with the}} Hobart City Council. She attended St Michael's Collegiate School in Hobart. In 1914, the family moved to the rural community of Bagdad, where they grew apple trees. The <b>bush</b> <b>setting</b> of Bagdad, including a bushranger's cave, would inspire some of her future writing, and also a lifelong involvement with the Australian Girl Guides movement. Initially organising Guide meetings and camps at her brother's Bagdad property, Chauncy started her own Guide troop in Claremont where she worked as a women's welfare officer at the Cadbury's Chocolate Factory from 1925.|$|E

50|$|Retained local brigalow-belah {{vegetation}} {{provides a}} <b>bush</b> <b>setting</b> for the botanic garden. The garden comprises thousands of ex situ Australian arid, semi-arid and dry tropical plants, mostly indigenous {{to other parts}} of Queensland and Australia. While the aesthetic of the garden is reflective of an uncultivated inland bush landscape, there is an underlying formality in the layout. The garden is organised into approximately 72 divisions, defined by timber corner pegs. Within the original divisions laid out by David Gordon, plants are grown according to their species, in some instances on raised gravel beds, and are located adjacent to other divisions within their genus. More recent divisions established in the garden generally feature plants from different genera; this occurs in response to soil and climatic variables within the garden or for a particular educational or scientific focus.|$|E
50|$|The 1950s {{were the}} key decade of {{development}} for Myall Park. Gordon {{was able to}} invest more time and money in the garden because of a boom in wool value that saw prices triple between 1947 and 1951. By this time 26,000 sheep were being shorn annually and Gordon was able to leave much of {{the responsibility of the}} property's day-to-day operations with an overseer. A timber residence for the overseer and family (now known as Avochie Cottage) was constructed in the early 1950s, south of the shearer's quarters. One hundred and twenty-eight hectares were fenced to prevent livestock from entering the garden. While much of the fenced area was cleared for growing purposes, with the managed garden taking up about 90 hectares, some existing brigalow-belah vegetation was retained, providing a <b>bush</b> <b>setting</b> for the garden.|$|E

The event was held at Carisbrook's harness racing track site, which differed from its usual <b>bush</b> <b>setting.</b> Despite this, the 2011 event, {{was regarded as a}} success, with the numbers by this stage increasing to 2500, and attracting international attendees. The event was also held there in 2012. While regarded as a successful event, it did cause some issues with noise as it was centrally located.After two years, the council moved the Festival out of Carisbrook, largely because of noise complaints, but noted the loss of revenue. 2012 also saw the festival run at Carisbrook racecourse, and featured a range of artists including Ace Ventura, Nerso, Zen Mechanics, Liquid Ace, The Riddler and laughing Buddha.|$|E

5000|$|In 1940, Wall decided her {{priority}} {{was a new}} Blinky Bill book with Angus & Robertson. In a letter to her publisher, she wrote: [...] "I'll have to do my utmost {{to get a new}} Blinky book out for next Christmas. I could do a good story with Blinky on National Service, providing the war continues - but I am not that wicked to wish such a thing". In February 1940 she sent her publisher the completed text for Blinky Bill Joins the Army. The publisher was unimpressed by her story of Blinky as an enlisted soldier, calling it 'heavy going' and a too obvious exploitation of 'patriotic fervour'. Wall apparently tore up the manuscript and wrote an entirely new version where Blinky remains in his familiar <b>bush</b> <b>setting</b> until the final pages then goes off to join the army - as a mascot. The new version was finished by the end of April 1940, {{less than a month after}} the first had been rejected; it was published for Christmas 1940.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{aspects of}} the Griffins' houses in Castlecrag were unusual and {{unconventional}} such as the treatment of stonework, the window details and the flat roofs. [...] Flat roofs were favoured over pitched roofs as they prevented the obstruction of views, provided vantage points where one could experience {{a view of the}} landscape and allowed for a rooftop garden. [...] Another atypical feature of the Griffin/Mahony Griffin houses was the unusual location of the kitchens and bathrooms. [...] These rooms were situated {{at the front of the}} house even though convention was to have these rooms at the back of the house. [...] The houses were designed in such a way so that the living rooms located at the rear; faced a view or park on the inner side of the allotment. [...] Their houses did not have front fences and built structures were minimal within ten metres of each property. [...] This, in addition to many of the houses being single story and boasting colours of the natural surroundings exemplifies the Griffins' objective which did not involve establishing imposing and artificial built structures, but rather to have the buildings blend in with the environment; retaining the <b>bush</b> <b>setting.</b> [...] Thus, the Griffins' designs were remarkably different from the uniform designs at the time - houses with red, pitched roofs - which Walter Burley Griffin detested.|$|E
40|$|Her {{essay on}} 'Southern Steel' (1953), {{a novel by}} {{politically}} committed Australian writer Dymphna Cusack, is set in Newcastle. The writers's descriptions of life in this town are based on her own experience when she taught there from 1942 to 1943. Vuaille-Barcan presents {{a brief overview of}} Australian literature between {{the end of the nineteenth}} century and the 1940 s in order to situate this novel within its national, historical and literary context. She demonstrates that Cusack's particular brand of 'social realism' was ahead of its time, for example in the choice of an urban setting when her contemporaries were still nostalgically opting for the mythological <b>bush</b> <b>setting.</b> She highlights Cusack's contribution to the creation of a genuinely Australian literary canon and seeks to understand why this writer's work is frequently underrated today...|$|E
