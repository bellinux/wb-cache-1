5|$|Poisoning {{typically}} {{results from}} ingestion of {{food or water}} contaminated with lead, and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil, dust, or lead-based paint. Seawater products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters. Fruit and vegetables can <b>be</b> <b>contaminated</b> by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in. Soil can <b>be</b> <b>contaminated</b> through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint, and residual emissions from leaded gasoline.|$|E

5|$|Beef steak can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, {{does not need to be}} cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially <b>be</b> <b>contaminated</b> from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy fishing {{pressure}} {{within its}} range, the cloudy catshark remains common, {{perhaps because it}} may be more biologically productive than most other sharks. As a result, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Cloudy catsharks from a number of locations off Japan have been found to <b>be</b> <b>contaminated</b> with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDEs), which they acquire from their food. One likely source of these pollutants is the use of the pesticide DDT by developing nations in southern Asia.|$|E

Along with the neighbouring Ironworks site, it is owned by Norland Construction, a crane and plant company formerly known as Reeds Cranes and Plant, the building used as storage for their machinery. The site is thought to <b>be</b> <b>contaminated</b> with coal products, fuels and oils such as PCBs, as well as dioxins and furans. In 2003, Newcastle City Council released plans that they hoped to redevelop the site for heritage tourism in the future.|$|E
5|$|A February 2000 {{story about}} organic {{vegetables}} on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests {{had shown that}} neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food {{was more likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>contaminated</b> by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.|$|E
5|$|Mallard {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. Almost all domestic duck breeds derive from the mallard, {{with the exception of}} a few Muscovy breeds. Mallards are generally monogamous while domestic ducks are mostly polygamous. Domestic ducks have no territorial behaviour and are less aggressive than mallards. Domestic ducks are mostly kept for meat, as their eggs have a strong flavor. They were first domesticated in Southeast Asia at least 4000 years ago, during the Neolithic Age, and were also farmed by the Romans in Europe, and the Malays in Asia. It is also common for mallards to mate with domestic ducks and produce hybrid offspring that are fully fertile. Due to this, mallards have been found to <b>be</b> <b>contaminated</b> with the genes of the domestic duck.|$|E
