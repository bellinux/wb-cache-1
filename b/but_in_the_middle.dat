5|$|On August 2, 2008, Judah lost to Joshua Clottey by {{technical}} {{decision in}} a fight for the vacant IBF Welterweight title at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. Judah began the busier fighter, showing quick hands and throwing effective combinations behind a jab. Clottey began steadily closing the distance between himself and his opponent from the third round, landing {{an increasing number of}} punches that took their toll on Judah. In round four, Clottey landed an uppercut that caused Judah to lose his balance, {{and by the end of}} the round, Judah had blood running down his nose. Judah staged a comeback in the sixth round, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the seventh round, Clottey landed a right hand that hurt Judah and caused him to back into a corner. In round nine, Judah suffered a cut over his right eye and the fight was stopped after he said he could not see. The referee had ruled the cut was caused by an accidental clash of heads and so the fight went to the scorecards. Two judges scored the fight 86–85 and the other judge scored it 87–84, all in favor of Clottey.|$|E

Ginsberg took this advice and attempted to write a poem with no restrictions. He was under the immense influence of William Carlos Williams and Jack Kerouac and attempted to speak with his own voice spontaneously. Ginsberg began the poem in the stepped triadic form he took from Williams <b>but,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of typing the poem, his style altered such that his own unique form (a long line based on breath organized by a fixed base) began to emerge.|$|E

He placed first in both the short program and free skating with a total score of 286.86 points, earning him his third {{consecutive}} Japan National Championships title and the first spot for Japan at the 2015 World Championships. He withdrew from the gala following the competition due to abdominal pain. Hanyu {{was diagnosed with a}} bladder problem related to the urachus and had surgery. He was hospitalized for two weeks, and was expected to resume training a month afterwards. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of February, he sprained his right ankle and once again, suspended on-ice training for two weeks.

25|$|Asian cinema {{has also}} {{produced}} horror films about ghosts, {{such as the}} 1998 Japanese film Ringu (remade in the US as The Ring in 2002), and the Pang brothers' 2002 film The Eye. Indian ghost movies are popular not just in India, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East, Africa, South East Asia {{and other parts of}} the world. Some Indian ghost movies such as the comedy / horror film Chandramukhi have been commercial successes, dubbed into several languages. Generally the films are based on the experiences of modern people who are unexpectedly exposed to ghosts, and usually draw on traditional Indian literature or folklore. In some cases the Indian films are remakes of western films, such as Anjaane, based on Alejandro Amenábar's ghost story The Others.|$|E

Isidora's father finds a husband for her, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the wedding celebrations, Melmoth tries to abduct Isidora. Her brother tries to intervene, and Melmoth kills him. Isidora falls senseless and Melmoth escapes. Isidora reveals that she is already married, to Melmoth. She gives birth, but she and her baby daughter are imprisoned by the Inquisition. The inquisitors threaten {{to take away the}} child, but find that it is already dead. Isidora, dying of grief, remembers her island paradise, and asks if 'he' will be in the heavenly paradise.|$|E
25|$|Geonic responsa {{are written}} in three languages, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic. In the {{earliest}} period Aramaic, {{the language of the}} Gemara, prevailed exclusively, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the ninth century Hebrew began to appear in the responsa side by side with it. This innovation was due, on the one hand, to the study of Hebrew, which spread through rabbinical circles {{as a result of the}} Karaite movement, and, on the other, to the fact that the rulings of the Geonim were sent to distant lands, where the inhabitants were unfamiliar with Aramaic; it thus became necessary to write to them in Hebrew, the dialect of the Mishnah. When Arabic became the prevailing language of the Jews, questions were frequently addressed to the Geonim in that tongue, whereupon the scholars of the academies used the same language in reply.|$|E

500|$|Bedrock composes {{much of the}} {{streambed}} in {{the upper}} and lower reaches of the Kootenay, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> portion, alluvial sediments allow the river to meander over a broader valley floor. The sediments probably originated through heavy glaciation during the previous Ice Age. About 15,000 years ago, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet advanced southwards into present-day BC, Montana and Idaho, blocking the Kootenay River at the outlet of Kootenay Lake, which [...] did not yet exist. Glaciers covered most of the northern Kootenay River watershed and heavily shaped the peaks and valleys one sees today. The glacier that formed Kootenay Lake caused the river to back up into an enormous body of water that stretched all the way to Libby, Montana, near where the Libby Dam now stands, and possibly even connected to Lake Pend Oreille, which also was much enlarged at the time. Glacially deposited sediments buried the old streambed of the Kootenay River and created a natural dam where the Kootenay turns west out of Kootenay Lake. After the glaciers retreated, Kootenay Lake receded to its present level and the Kootenay Flats were formed.|$|E

2500|$|According to the programme, {{dogs were}} {{initially}} bred for practical {{functions such as}} hunting and guarding, <b>but,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 19th century they became a status symbol, and dog breeding became a sport.

2500|$|The name {{is already}} defined [...] in extant manuscripts of the Liber Coloniarum into Teramne, whence its modern form of Teramo. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages {{it appears to}} have been known also by the name of Aprutium, {{supposed}} to be a corruption of Praetutium, or rather of the name of the people Praetutii, applied (as was so often the case in Gaul) to their chief city. Thus the name Abrutium is present among the cities of Picenum enumerated by the Geographer of Ravenna (iv. 31); and under the Lombards a comes Aprutii is mentioned. The name has been retained in that of Abruzzo, now a region of Italy.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{legitimate}} scholarly arguments {{in favour of}} both the Insular Celtic hypothesis and the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis. Proponents of each schema dispute the accuracy and usefulness of the other's categories. However, since the 1970s the division into Insular and Continental Celtic has become the more widely held view (Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; Schrijver 1995), <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 1980s, the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis found new supporters (Lambert 1994), because of the inscription on the Larzac piece of lead (1983), the analysis of which reveals another common phonetical innovation -nm- > -nu (Gaelic ainm / Gaulish anuana, Old Welsh enuein [...] "names"), that is less accidental than only one.

2500|$|In late January 1164, {{the king}} summoned his major barons {{as well as}} the bishops to Clarendon Palace for a council. Once it assembled, the king demanded that the bishops and Becket swear to uphold without {{reservations}} the customs of the church as they had been in the king's grandfather's reign. At first, Becket refused, but threats and other arguments eventually persuaded him to support the customs, and Becket then ordered the remaining bishops to assent also. [...] The king then proposed to have a committee of barons and clerks compile these customs into a written document, which would be presented to the council. This was done, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the recitation of the customs, Becket asked for a postponement in order for him to consult with others about the customs. However, he eventually accepted these customs, and the bishops also swore to uphold these, which subsequently became known as the Constitutions of Clarendon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lounge suit}} was once only worn as smart leisure wear {{in the country}} or at the seaside, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 19th century started to rise rapidly in popularity. [...] It took {{on the role of}} a more casual {{alternative}} to the morning coat for town wear, moving the latter up in the scale of formality. The more the morning coat became fashionable as correct daytime full dress, the more the lounge suit became acceptable as an informal alternative, and finally the more the frock coat became relegated to the status of ultra-formal day wear, worn only by older men. [...] At the most formal events during the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, heads of government wore the frock coat, but at more informal meetings they wore morning coats or even a lounge suit. In 1926, George V hastened the demise of the frock coat when he shocked the public by appearing {{at the opening of the}} Chelsea Flower Show wearing a morning coat. The frock coat barely survived the 1930s only as an ultra-formal form of court dress, until being finally officially abolished in 1936 as official court dress by Edward VIII (who later abdicated to become the Duke of Windsor). [...] It was replaced by the morning coat, thus consigning the frock coat to the status of historic dress.|$|E
