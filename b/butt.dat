5|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} radical in his progressivism, Taft was {{hardened}} in his resolve to achieve re-nomination, {{as he was}} convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government. One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald <b>Butt,</b> one of the last links between the previous and present presidents, as <b>Butt</b> had formerly served Roosevelt. Ambivalent between his loyalties, <b>Butt</b> went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking, a death Taft found hard to accept as his body was not recovered.|$|E

50|$|Now again {{free from}} suspicion, Funderburke {{continues}} a decades long spree of sexually motivated murders. Shortly after World War II, violent Army veteran Sonny <b>Butts</b> is {{appointed to the}} post of assistant police chief in Delano {{because he is a}} war hero. When the serving chief dies of a heart attack, the city council appoints <b>Butts</b> to fill the vacancy. <b>Butts</b> figures out Funderburke's guilt, just as town father Holmes tells <b>Butts</b> he is about to take his badge due to a series of depredations culminating in Butts's murder of a Medgar Evers-like figure. Sure that solving the decades-long mystery will save his job, <b>Butts</b> goes to Funderburke's land and catches him in the very act of burying his latest victim. But as <b>Butts</b> chortles over his victory, letting down his guard, Funderburke strikes <b>Butts</b> with the shovel in his hands, shoots <b>Butts</b> with his own police revolver, and buries his body on the spot—along with his police motorcycle. No one makes the connection between the disappearance of <b>Butts</b> and the long-unsolved murders.|$|R

5|$|While blank {{variety is}} the {{defining}} demarcation between one Balabushka cue and another, {{there are some}} shared features spanning Balabushka's fleeting 16-year career. Cue forearms were characteristically made with straight-grained maple, based on Balabushka's belief that a single-direction maple grain provided superior integrity to that of curly maple or birdseye maple. He used stainless steel joints and delrin <b>butt</b> caps almost exclusively. A small number of his cues feature ivory joints and ivory <b>butt</b> caps, making them highly valued collector's items. Balabushka used a distinguishing reddish-brown bumper, and employed Cortland Irish linen for many of his wraps, with the highly sought after leather wrap a rare departure for him and a distinct value enhancer. Unless a different length was specified, Balabushka made all his cues to a standard 57½ inches in length.|$|E

5000|$|While {{coaching}} at Georgia, Griffith became {{embroiled in}} the controversy created when the Saturday Evening Post ran an article alleging that Wally <b>Butts</b> and Bear Bryant had conspired to fix games.

Griffith denied that he made the statement attributed to him and otherwise called the facts of the Post story into question. <b>Butts</b> and Bryant also vehemently denied the truth of the story. <b>Butts</b> eventually won the case.|$|R

5|$|After its closure the {{pumping station}} lay {{derelict}} {{until the late}} 1960s, when the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust proposed to the British Waterways Board that students from the University of Bath conduct a survey and report on the viability of returning the pumping station to working order. Work started in 1969 with engineering students from Bath providing the labour {{under the supervision of}} John <b>Butt,</b> and the Trust providing the funding. Within the building rotten woodwork was replaced and electric lighting installed. To work on the sluices and the waterwheel the leat was dammed. Specialist wood and metal work was undertaken by apprentices from the British Aircraft Corporation in Filton. By 1972 some progress had been made; John <b>Butt</b> retired and Derrick Dudden took over as restoration manager, with more volunteers from the Canal Trust helping to provide the labour. Silt was removed from the pond, hatches replaced and the waterwheel restored. The 408 oak teeth on the pitwheel were replaced and the pumps overhauled with new rope packing. By February 1976 all the machinery was working and water could be pumped from the river to the canal. The pumping station was formally re-opened in 1978.|$|E
5|$|By 1899, Waterloo had 16 {{platforms}} {{but only}} 10 numbers allocated in different {{sections of the}} station or on different levels; some numbers were duplicated.

It was criticised and satirised in several Punch cartoons.|$|E
5|$|Flock {{behaviour}} in sheep {{is generally}} only exhibited {{in groups of}} four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep. Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered. Cornered sheep may charge and <b>butt,</b> or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.|$|E

5|$|Like spot welding, {{seam welding}} relies on two {{electrodes}} to apply pressure and current to join metal sheets. However, instead of pointed electrodes, wheel-shaped electrodes roll along and often feed the workpiece, {{making it possible}} to make long continuous welds. In the past, this process was used in the manufacture of beverage cans, but now its uses are more limited. Other resistance welding methods include <b>butt</b> welding, flash welding, projection welding, and upset welding.|$|E
