Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

25|$|Allison {{never played}} another first team game for West Ham nor indeed any other First Division game as Moore became a regular. A {{composed}} central defender, Moore was admired for his {{reading of the}} game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Indeed, Moore's ability to head the ball or keep up with the pace was average at best, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he read the game, marshalled his team and timed his tackles marked him out as world class.|$|E
25|$|Franklin D.

Its winding, hilly route was designed by landscape architect Gilmore Clarke to offer scenic vistas of the Hudson Highlands, Catskills and Taconic regions.

25|$|Adolf Hitler {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the psychological tactics of warfare the British had employed during WWI, and attributed the defeat of Germany to the effects this propaganda had on the soldiers.

By calling his movement The Third Reich, he was able to convince many civilians that his cause was not just a fad, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of their future. Joseph Goebbels was appointed as Propaganda Minister when Hitler came to power in 1933, and he portrayed Hitler as a messianic figure for the redemption of Germany.

25|$|There {{is little}} openly {{published}} {{information on the}} device shipments of desktop and laptop computers. Gartner publishes estimates, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the estimates are calculated is not openly published. Another source of market share of various operating systems is StatCounter basing its estimate on web use (although {{this may not be}} very accurate). Also, sales may overstate usage. Most computers are sold with a pre-installed operating system (OS); some users replace that OS with a different one due to personal preference, or install another OS alongside it and use both. Conversely, sales underestimate usage by not counting unauthorized copies. For example, in 2009, approximately 80% of software sold in China were due to copyright infringement. In 2007, the statistics from an automated update of IE7 for registered Windows computers differed with the observed web browser share, leading one writer to estimate that 25–35% of all Windows XP installations were illegal.|$|E
25|$|The {{diplomatic}} unrest {{around this}} question disturbed De Witt no end. His initial relations with Louis {{had been very}} amicable. In 1662 he renewed the old alliance with France, as we have seen, and this alliance was helpful in the conflict with England and Munster, when the French sent auxiliary troops to help shore up the Dutch eastern defenses in 1665. Except for the Caribbean, France did not {{take part in the}} war with England. As a matter of fact the new French West India Company, formed in 1664, took Cayenne by force away from the WIC in 1665, but the Dutch were forced to grin and bear this, because of the ongoing war with England at the time. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Louis was acting in the matter of the Spanish Netherlands made De Witt anxious that the old partition treaty should not become operational. It offered a number of equally unpalatable prospects for the Dutch: unwanted incorporation of Antwerp (the blockade of which was now enshrined in the peace treaty of 1648 with Spain) would open up that city's trade; and a resurgent France as an immediate neighbor would necessitate the building up of the standing army, an expense the regents wanted to avoid at all costs.|$|E

[...] Likewise, Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan found Yaron's performance [...] "exceptional". By contrast, Peter Cavanese from Pleasanton Weekly disliked the idea of Shira marrying under the circumstances in the film and wrote that she [...] "comes across as temperamentally battered by her mother and her potential husband, who is himself slow to see the wisdom of marrying Shira".|$|E
