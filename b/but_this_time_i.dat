Further speaking with AMH TV, {{he went on to say}} that [...] "e spent two months...composing new stuff, composing new songs. And we feel very optimistic about the future. We're already enjoying a lot of the new stuff. We want to make the strongest album we can do. I mean, all the bands say they try to make the strongest album, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> think we will really do it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} interview, {{when asked whether}} the series had finished, both co-creators {{answered}} with a simultaneous [...] "Yes!". Morris expressed that [...] "I think the time is right. After the first film, I wanted to hear more from Jay, Will, Neil and Simon. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> feel there is enough. There {{is more than enough}} Jay in this world", and Beesley added [...] "The end of the story has always felt like the time where they go off and start living their adult life. And I think this film takes us up to that point".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in September 2008 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. Lovato recalled the experience, [...] "It was like, O.K., you've done it. You're no longer just succeeding because you're in a movie with the Jonas Brothers. These people bought your music for you." [...] Later in February 2009, Lovato's first headlining sitcom, Sonny with a Chance, premiered on Disney Channel. Don't Forget was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and spawned two singles, [...] "Get Back" [...] and [...] "La La Land". In January 2009, Lovato announced to MTV News that she had already begun writing songs for her second studio album, as well as revealing its approach: [...] "It's {{going to take a}} different sound, so hopefully it goes over well. I sing a lot of rock, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> want to do more John Mayer-ish type of songs. Hopefully I can write with people like him. I love their music — it would be amazing." ...|$|E

5000|$|Arnaz's {{determination}} to change scheduling formats went back several years, {{as far back}} as 1954. [...] "When I first suggested it, CBS wouldn't listen.

500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the Browns, the Braves were contenders {{all the way}} to the end of the 1948 season. In a {{game against}} the Philadelphia Phillies on 3 September, and with the Braves tied for the NL lead, Heath hit a two-run home run and the Braves went on to win the game, 3–1, and stayed in first place for the {{remainder}} of the regular season. With the Braves up five games in the NL standings and four games remaining on their regular season schedule, the Braves had a match-up with the Brooklyn Dodgers on 29 September but according to teammate Clint Conatser, Heath asked Braves manager Billy Southworth for the night off but his request was denied. During the game, Heath attempted to score from second base and slid towards home plate to try and beat the tag by Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella. As he slid, his foot got caught in the dirt which caused his ankle to twist. [...] "I began to slide about five feet from the plate. Funny thing, I generally get my spikes up off the ground, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> didn't. I looked at my foot, which was twisted all the way around, and honestly I thought it would come right off", Heath said the next day from a local hospital. After playing in the majors for parts of 12 years, he would be forced to miss the World Series as it was later diagnosed he fractured his ankle. He called the broken ankle [...] "the biggest disappointment of my life." [...] A widely published newspaper photograph of the play showed Heath sliding toward the plate, mouth open in shock, with his leg bent mid-ankle with the lower ankle rotated ninety degrees to the upper ankle. He was quoted asking himself [...] "Why did I slide?" [...] when he was carried off the field on a stretcher and later put in an ambulance. In 1964, Heath said: ...|$|E
2500|$|During a press release, Epic Records {{described}} the album as a deeply personal record; {{speaking about the}} concept and themes on the album, Ciara said [...] "I can sometimes be afraid of my own vulnerability, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> let myself face it. I let myself feel. I let myself be real. I let myself hurt and be healed." [...] Spin and Idolator {{described the}} album as [...] {{an updated version of}} crunk, a sound that Ciara was familiar with in 2004, and contained my pop moments. Ciara explained the influence behind the album's theme saying, ...|$|E

2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E
2500|$|Zander Hollander, {{who wrote}} The Complete Handbook of Pro Football, said about Gradishar, [...] "Not as nasty as Butkus, doesn't snarl like Lambert, but Gradishar {{makes all the}} plays. Hey, he can hit, too. Just ask Saints' Henry Childs, after Gradishar knocked his helmet off, [...] "It {{was the first in}} my career like that, in the open field". Gradishar's hitting ability was a {{sentiment}} echoed in Rick Korch's book, The Truly Great. In it, Tony Dorsett recalled the hit Gradishar gave him in a 1980 game, [...] "I ran a pass pattern and was wide open but Danny White did not see me. I go back to the huddle and tell Danny that I am wide open. I ran the same route again <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was almost decapitated. My eyes were only partially open when I hit the ground. Trainers and doctors came running onto the field. They thought I was dead. Hey, I thought I was dead, too." [...] Hall of Fame defensive lineman Dan Hampton remembers asking Walter Payton, [...] "Walter, who gave you the hardest hit you ever took in the NFL?". According to Hampton, Payton replied, [...] "Randy Gradishar, 1978". In 1981 SPORT magazine named Gradishar one of the Top 5 hardest hitters in the NFL, quoting the modest Gradishar, [...] "The chance for a real good shot comes very seldom, but when it's there I take full advantage of it".|$|E
2500|$|He {{was posted}} on {{attachment}} to the 3rd The King's Own Hussars, which was serving in the North African Campaign at the time, and joined the regiment {{just in time for}} the beginning of Operation Compass. This was a British offensive against Italian forces in North Africa, which began in December, 1940, and participated in the Battle of Sidi Barrani. In the aftermath of one battle, he was detailed to supervise a burial party and came across a damaged Italian tank, its entire crew dead; unable to recover the bodies, Farran set the tank's petrol tank on fire. After Operation Compass came to an end, the Hussars were transferred to the island of Crete, to reinforce the British and Commonwealth forces that were stationed there after their retreat from Greece. Farran was attached to the regiment's 'C' Squadron, which was located several miles west of Canea when the Germans began their invasion of Crete on 20 May 1941. Farran was ordered to take a troop of tanks and block a road that led from the village of Galatas, and shortly afterwards sighted and killed a number of German troops escorting a group of 40 captured hospital patients. The troop came under attack from Stukas and well hidden ground forces. Returning from this mission Farran's troop encountered several Germans who attempted to surrender; he ordered them shot, later writing that the incident occurred in the heat of the moment. [...] On 21 May, the 10th Infantry Brigade launched a successful assault on Cemetery Hill, in which Farran participated. German forces were eventually able to break through the British and Commonwealth positions around Galatas, and Farran was part of a counter-attack in an attempt to retake the village. He protested about the unsuitability of his light tanks for the task but was told that no heavy tanks were left. Farran later wrote of his guilt at allowing the dangerous lead position to be taken by a subordinate -"I did not care for orders when it suited me, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had chosen to obey them because I knew that I would be killed if I did not. I should have been in that leading tank. Instead, there was Skedgewell dead and his pretty young wife waiting at home. I felt as if I had murdered him." [...] During the action he was wounded in the right arm and both of his legs, and as a result he was captured by German forces. It was at this time that he was awarded the Military Cross, for gallantry during his service in Crete.|$|E

60|$|Poor Mrs. Tinkum--or, as {{she would}} have been apt to call herself, Miss Tinkum! She had betrayed one of the commonest {{weaknesses}} of human nature, in thus imputing pride to the Chainbearer's niece because the latter behaved differently from her and hers. How many persons in this good republic of ours judge their neighbors on precisely the same principle; inferring something unsuitable, because it seems to reflect on their own behavior! <b>But</b> by <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> had got to hear the name of Dus with some interest, and I felt disposed to push the subject further.|$|R

50|$|Louis I participated {{actively}} in foreign politics. On 21 May 1379, {{with his brother}} Wenceslaus I, he renewed his homage to King Wenceslaus IV. In exchange, the King promised the succession to the whole Duchy of Legnica-Brzeg only to the descendants of Bolesław III the Generous from then on, which saved this line of the House of Piast from further intrusions by their relatives. A second renewal of homage took place on 6 January 1383, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> Louis <b>I</b> had to renounce any claims over the duchies whose current holders were relatives of the King of Bohemia: Wroclaw, Schweidnitz and Jawor.|$|R
