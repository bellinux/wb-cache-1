2500|$|Newsgroup spam {{is a type}} of spam {{where the}} targets are Usenet newsgroups. Spamming of Usenet newsgroups {{actually}} pre-dates e-mail spam. Usenet convention defines spamming as excessive multiple posting, that is, the repeated posting of a message (or substantially similar messages). The prevalence of Usenet spam {{led to the development of}} the <b>Breidbart</b> <b>Index</b> as an objective measure of a message's [...] "spamminess".|$|E
50|$|The <b>Breidbart</b> <b>Index,</b> {{developed}} by Seth Breidbart, {{is the most}} significant cancel index in Usenet.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{hierarchy}} {{specific rules}} (see <b>Breidbart</b> <b>Index)</b> allow cancelbots to send third-party cancels to remove spam.|$|E
50|$|In {{hierarchy}} de.* the <b>Breidbart</b> <b>index</b> is {{used with}} a time range of seven days instead of 45. This is denoted by the abbreviation BI7.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Breidbart</b> <b>Index</b> {{of a set}} of {{articles}} is defined as the sum of the square root of n, where n is the number of newsgroups to which an article is cross posted.|$|E
50|$|A more {{aggressive}} criterion, <b>Breidbart</b> <b>Index</b> Version 2, has been proposed. The BI2 {{is defined as}} the sum of the square root of n, plus the sum of n, divided by two. A single message would only need to be crossposted to 35 newsgroups to breach the threshold of 20.|$|E

5000|$|The {{prevalence}} of Usenet spam {{led to the}} development of the <b>Breidbart</b> <b>Index</b> as an objective measure of a message's [...] "spamminess". The use of the BI and spam-detection software has led to Usenet being policed by anti-spam volunteers, who purge newsgroups of spam by sending cancels and filtering it out on the way into servers. This very active form of policing has meant that Usenet is a far less attractive target to spammers than it used to be, and most of the industrial-scale spammers have now moved into e-mail spam instead.|$|E
