5|$|Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) {{encourages}} Paul {{to start}} dating again, {{and he has}} a number of casual relationships using a dating app. He falls out with Daniel when he puts his romance with Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow) before work. After they argue, Daniel and Amber go out into a tornado that hits Erinsborough. Paul goes after them and his car is hit by a dislodged skip. Daniel and Amber rescue him. He suffers broken ribs and a cracked prosthetic. Paul decides he is ready to be mayor again and organises a media gathering at Sonya's Nursery, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> postponed when the nursery is vandalised. Paul discovers Jayden Warley (Khan Oxenham) was behind the vandalism, and he blackmails Jayden's mother Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) into stepping down as interim mayor. Dakota Davies (Sheree Murphy), a fling from Paul's time in Brazil, arrives in Erinsborough and tells Paul that he abandoned her without explanation to return to Australia in 2004. Paul's memories of this are unclear due to his brain tumour, but he agrees to help her set up a bar. Paul falls in love with Dakota, but he soon learn that she is involved in diamond smuggling. She leaves after asking him for money.|$|E

25|$|Direct skyglow {{is reduced}} by {{selecting}} lighting fixtures which {{limit the amount of}} light emitted above the horizontal (90° above the nadir). Indirect skyglow produced by reflections from illuminated surfaces is harder to manage; effective methods for limiting it include the use of low-impact lamp types (e.g. amber sources, see above), minimizing over-illumination and inefficient designs or fixtures that spread light where it is not needed. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken into account that, according to late 2010 publications, Italian regions using full cut off lighting only does not increase skyglow. Anyway, light reflected upwards by dark surfaces such as roads or buildings can be considered as minor, so debate about the contribution of indirect skyglow will continue.|$|E

500|$|Del Toro {{had never}} shot a film {{in less than}} 115 days, but had only 103 to shoot Pacific Rim. In order to achieve this, del Toro {{scheduled}} a splinter unit that he could direct early in the day, before main unit, and on his off-days. The director worked 17 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week, {{for much of the}} schedule. Del Toro took a new approach to directing actors, allowing [...] "looser" [...] movements and improvisation; the director maintained tight control over the production: [...] "Everything, 100% goes through me sooner or later. I do not delegate anything. Some people like it, some people don't, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done that way." ...|$|E

It all has to be different. And it is, but, again, with just enough 'sameness' to make us feel like we are at home again. I'm looking forward to wherever these movies are taking us". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is [...] "likely to draw in just about everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them". New York Magazines David Edelstein deemed the film a [...] "distinctly unmagical slog", remarking that the beasts [...] "aren’t especially fantastic and the effects are too blandly corporate to be exhilarating".|$|E
500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they can get {{a lot of people who}} think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word rock, people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." [...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work. [...] really loved the music we were doing, and it showed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Small's 1772 {{aggregate}} of 213 {{runs from}} six innings {{would give him}} an average of 35.50 if all his innings were completed (i.e., the scorecards in 1772 do not confirm the not out batsmen). This may seem low by modern standards <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> remembered that prevailing pitch conditions were such that [...] "the scoring potential of the 18th century batsman was only about 30% of the 20th or 21st century batsman". 18th century pitches were fully exposed to the elements, underwent rudimentary preparation and were not flat: Lumpy Stevens in particular was a master at selecting one {{in which there was}} a distinctive brow or ridge that would enable him to bowl [...] "shooters".|$|E
2500|$|In early January 2009, Romney {{supported}} the $750 billion federal {{economic stimulus package}} proposed by the incoming president, Barack Obama, {{who had not yet}} taken office. Romney said at the time: [...] "I frankly wish that the last Congress would have dealt with the stimulus issue and that the president [...] could assign that before leaving office. I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they'll be doing, and that's net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that up in a very difficult time.... I'd move quickly. These are unusual times. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> something which relieves pressure on middle-income families. I think a tax cut is necessary for them as well as for businesses that are growing. We'll be investing in infrastructure and in energy technologies." [...] However, as a candidate for president in May 2012, Romney said that the economic stimulus package that had been enacted in February 2009 (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) had been a waste of money that did little to jump-start the economy, and that the federal government had inflated the numbers of jobs that had been created or preserved by the various projects funded through the stimulus program.|$|E

When Belle suggests Gold, believing that he is no worse that Emma, everyone else turns a deaf ear saying its a risk they have to take if Gold gets hurt, and a furious Belle storms out. Out in the woods, Gold stares at the chipped tea cup in his hands and says [...] "Forgive Me, Belle," [...] then kisses it and breaks the glass in order to take the shards to free himself from the ropes. When Emma arrives to the spot to see if Gold has made any progress, they discovered Gold has escaped. Emma then forces Merida to find him, and threatens the archer by destroying her heart by having Merida kill Belle in order to turn Gold into the hero she needs to release Excalibur. As for Belle, she uses a street map to find out where Emma is keeping Gold, then hears a noise from the elevator, prompting her to take a weapon. She opens it and it's Gold, who warns Belle that Merida's after her by using Gold to turn him into a hero but {{in order to do that}} Emma has made Belle a target, and the two race back to the pawn shop to find magic.|$|E
