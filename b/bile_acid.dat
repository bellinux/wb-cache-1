5|$|Heterozygous FH is {{normally}} treated with statins, <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> sequestrants, or other lipid lowering agents that lower cholesterol levels. New cases are generally offered genetic counseling. Homozygous FH often {{does not respond}} to medical therapy and may require other treatments, including LDL apheresis (removal of LDL in a method similar to dialysis) and occasionally liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Given that FH {{is present}} from birth and {{atherosclerotic}} changes may begin early in life, {{it is sometimes}} necessary to treat adolescents or even teenagers with agents that were originally developed for adults. Due to safety concerns, many physicians prefer to use <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> sequestrants and fenofibrate as these are licensed in children. Nevertheless, statins seem safe and effective, and in older children {{may be used as}} in adults.|$|E
5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E
25|$|Lignin {{in fiber}} adsorbs <b>bile</b> <b>acids,</b> but the un{{conjugated}} {{form of the}} <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> are adsorbed more than the conjugated form. In the ileum where <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> are primarily absorbed the <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> are predominantly conjugated.|$|R
50|$|Colestyramine removes <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> {{from the}} body by forming {{insoluble}} complexes with <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> in the intestine, which are then excreted in the feces. As {{a result of this}} loss of <b>bile</b> <b>acids,</b> more plasma cholesterol is converted to <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> in the liver to normalise levels. This conversion of cholesterol into <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> lowers plasma cholesterol levels.|$|R
50|$|Cholic {{acid and}} chenodeoxycholic acid {{are the most}} {{important}} human <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> Other species may synthesize different <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> as their predominant primary <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Bile</b> <b>acid</b> {{sequestrants}} such as cholestyramine can {{be effective}} in chronic diarrhea due to <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> malabsorption. Therapeutic trials of these drugs are indicated in chronic diarrhea if <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> malabsorption cannot be diagnosed with a specific test, such as SeHCAT retention.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{action of}} some fibers {{is to reduce}} the reabsorption of bile acids in the ileum and hence the amount and type of <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> and fats reaching the colon. A reduction in the reabsorption of <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> from the ileum has several direct effects.|$|E

30|$|Gut {{microbiota}} {{can affect}} cardiovascular health via secondary <b>bile</b> <b>acids,</b> deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, {{both of which}} are the main ligand for TGR 5 (Fiorucci et al., 2010; Duboc et al., 2014). Primary <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> including chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid, with FXR as their the receptor, have distinct effects on cardiac health when compared to secondary <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> (Fiorucci et al., 2010). Consistently, the serum level of primary <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> were found decreased while ratios of secondary <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> to primary <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> were increased in cardiovascular disease patients compared to healthy controls (Mayerhofer et al., 2017).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bile</b> <b>acids</b> are steroid acids found {{predominantly}} in the bile {{of mammals}} and other vertebrates. Different molecular forms of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> can be synthesized {{in the liver}} by different species. [...] <b>Bile</b> <b>acids</b> are conjugated with taurine or glycine in the liver, and the sodium and potassium salts of these conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> are called <b>bile</b> salts.|$|R
40|$|This review {{makes an}} attempt to combine the {{insights}} gained into the biochemistry and physiology of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> with the elegant supramolecular systems designed from them. <b>Bile</b> <b>acids</b> are cholesterol-derived facial amphiphiles responsible for the solubilization of cholesterol and fat through mixed micelle formation with phospholipids. An intriguing aspect of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> is that their chemical structure has been postulated to correlate with vertebrate evolution. However, the etiology of molecular evolution of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> is still poorly understood. There has been a steady progress in the studies aimed at elucidating physiological functions and developing pharmacological applications of <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> In recent years, <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> and their analogues have been extensively utilized as supramolecular receptors for various types of guest molecules and ions. Under certain defined conditions, the supramolecular association of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> and their derivatives leads to gel formation. Thus, modified <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> might find use {{in the design of}} futuristic materials...|$|R
25|$|Other fibers, e.g., gum arabic, act as {{stabilizers}} {{and cause}} {{a significant decrease}} in serum cholesterol without increasing fecal <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> excretion.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{diarrhea}} can be {{the part}} of the presentations of a number of chronic medical conditions affecting the intestine. Common causes include ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, microscopic colitis, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome and <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> malabsorption.|$|E
25|$|Atorvastatin {{may be used}} in {{combination}} with <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> sequestrants and ezetimibe to increase the reduction in cholesterol levels. However, It is not recommended to combine statin drug treatment with certain other cholesterol-lowering drugs, particularly fibrates, because this may increase the risk of myopathy-related adverse effects.|$|E
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> bind to insoluble calcium phosphate at pH values beyond 5. 5. Significant binding occurs with glycine-conjugated dihydroxy <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> Results indicate that these <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> are bound in a micellar mode. Taurine conjugation almost completely inhibits the binding of these <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> to insoluble calcium phosphate. Since glycine-conjugated dihydroxy <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> are predominant in the rabbit, {{but not in}} the rat, our results suggest an explanation for the intriguing species-dependence of casein-induced hypercholesterolaemia, which is high in the rabbit but absent in the rat...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bile</b> <b>acids</b> {{have been}} implicated by {{epidemiologic}} evidence as causative agents in colon cancer. Previous {{studies have indicated}} that the <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> damage DNA. However, the conjugated forms of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> (eg. tauro conjugates) have not been tested for interaction with DNA. The present study compared the DNA-damaging ability of unconjugated and conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> using the E. coli SOS test system. The E. coli tester strain was incubated with the <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> and conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> Both cell survival and induction of the SOS response was measured. Among unconjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids,</b> deoxycholate, chenodeoxycholate, and lithocholic acid were confirmed as DNA damaging agents by a decrease in surviving fraction and increase of the fraction of blue colonies undergoing SOS induction with increasing doses. Cholate, however, did not cause DNA damage by these criteria. Among the conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids,</b> taurochenodeoxycholate caused as much DNA damage as chenodeoxycholate. Taurodeoxycholate caused DNA damage, but had less of an effect than deoxycholate. Taurocholate and taurolithocholate failed to show a DNA damaging effect...|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{secreting}} {{any of the}} <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> (primary or secondary, see below), liver cells conjugate {{them with}} one of two amino acids, glycine or taurine, to form a total of 8 possible conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> These conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> are {{often referred to as}} bile salts because of their physiologically-important acid-base properties. The pKa of the unconjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> are between 5 and 6.5, and the pH of the duodenum ranges between 3 and 5, so when unconjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> are in the duodenum, they are almost always protonated (HA form), which makes them relatively insoluble in water. Conjugating <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> with amino acids lowers the pKa of the bile-acid/amino-acid conjugate to between 1 and 4. Thus conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> are almost always in their deprotonated (A-) form in the duodenum, which makes them much more water-soluble and much more able to fulfil their physiologic function of emulsifying fats.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to its importance for animal cell structure, cholesterol {{also serves as a}} precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, <b>bile</b> <b>acid,</b> and vitamin D. Cholesterol is the principal sterol synthesized by all animals. In vertebrates, hepatic cells typically produce the greatest amounts. It is absent among prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), although there are some exceptions, such as Mycoplasma, which require cholesterol for growth.|$|E
25|$|Rapid {{weight loss}} {{increases}} risk of gallstones. Patients taking orlistat, a weight loss drug, {{may already be}} {{at increased risk for}} the formation of gall stones. Weight loss with orlistat can increase the risk of gall stones. On the contrary, ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA), a <b>bile</b> <b>acid,</b> also a drug marketed as Ursodiol, appears to prevent formation of gallstones during weight loss. A high fat diet during weight loss also appears to prevent gallstones.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol is {{susceptible}} to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives known as oxysterols. Three different mechanisms can form these: autoxidation, secondary oxidation to lipid peroxidation, and cholesterol-metabolizing enzyme oxidation. A great interest in oxysterols arose when they were shown to exert inhibitory actions on cholesterol biosynthesis. This finding {{became known as the}} “oxysterol hypothesis”. Additional roles for oxysterols in human physiology include their participation in <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis, function as transport forms of cholesterol, and regulation of gene transcription.|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological, {{laboratory}} and clinical {{studies have shown}} a good correlation between high serum cholesterol and increased risk for the incidence of coronary heart disease. Reduction in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic men reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Modification of diets such as ingestion of probiotic in the form offermented foods or lactic acid bacteria-containing foods is considered as a more natural way to decrease serum cholesterol in humans. Lactic acid bacteria isolated from dadih could reduce the total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic rats by deconjugation of bile salts. Deconjugation of bile salts by BSH of dadih LAB resulted in an increased production of deconjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> Deconjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> are less well absorbed from the small intestine than the conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> Thus, the amount of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> returned to the liver during enterohepatic circulation decreased. Deconjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> are also excreted more rapidly than conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> and they bind more easily to the dietary fiber and intestinal bacteria than conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> Loss of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> may indeed result in an increased requirement of cholesterol as a precursor for the synthesis of new <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> As a consequence, the total cholesterol levels in the body were decrease...|$|R
40|$|Effects of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> {{and their}} salts on {{absorption}} of other substances <b>Bile</b> <b>acids</b> and their salts increase intestinal absorption of lipids and transmembrane and paracellular transfer {{of small and}} endogenous and exogenous polar molecules. It has been established that they are good promotores of insulin absorption through skin and nasal mucose, and of blood-brain barrier transfer of salycilates and quinine. Effects of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> and their salts on absorption of other substances and their potential action It has been established that combination of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> with amphotericin B has potential Leishmanicideal effect and combination with ciprofloxacine has improved its antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro. <b>Bile</b> <b>acids</b> pharmacodynamic effects <b>Bile</b> <b>acids</b> have analgesic and hypoglycemic effect They also have anti-HIV effect probably suppressing virus transmission from cell to cell. Conclusion New studies of natural <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> and new synthetic <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> have revealed {{that they are not}} only adjuvants to existing active principles in pharmaceutical forms, but they can act as new therapeutic agents. However, it is necessary to study their possible mechanisms, but they are not crucial for their therapeutic application. Toxicological and pharmacological studies will determine the role of newly synthetized <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> and their salts in current therapy...|$|R
25|$|The enteric loss of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> {{results in}} {{increased}} synthesis of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> from cholesterol {{which in turn}} reduces body cholesterol.|$|R
25|$|Another {{possible}} cause of diarrhea is {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS), which usually presents with abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation and unusual stool (diarrhea or constipation) for at least 3 days a week over the previous 3 months. Symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS can be managed {{through a combination of}} dietary changes, soluble fiber supplements and medications such as loperamide or codeine. About 30% of patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS have <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> malabsorption diagnosed with an abnormal SeHCAT test.|$|E
25|$|Pharmaceutical {{residues}} {{that have}} been conjugated (bound to a <b>bile</b> <b>acid)</b> before being excreted from the patients may undergo de-conjugation in the STP, yielding higher levels of free pharmaceutical substance in the outlet from the STP than in its incoming water. Some pharmaceuticals with large sales volumes have not been detected in the incoming water to the STP, indicating that complete metabolism and degradation must have occurred already in the patient or during the transport of sewage from the household to the STP.|$|E
25|$|In {{people who}} have {{undergone}} gallbladder removal, the <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> sequestrant cholestyramine may help minor degrees of FI. Bulking agents also absorb water, so may be helpful for those with diarrhea. A common side effect is bloating and flatulence. Topical agents to treat and prevent dermatitis may also be used, such as topical antifungals when {{there is evidence of}} perianal candidiasis or occasionally mild topical anti-inflammatory medication. Prevention of secondary lesions is carried out by perineal cleansing, moisturization, and use of a skin protectant.|$|E
40|$|Objective-To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} twice-daily oral administration of hydrocortisone on the <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> composition of gallbladder bile in dogs. Animals- 6 placebo-treated control dogs and 6 hydrocortisone-treated dogs. Procedures-Dogs received hydrocortisone (median dose, 8. 5 mg/kg) or a gelatin capsule (control group) orally every 12 hours for 84 days. Gallbladder bile samples were obtained via percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis from each dog before (day 0 [baseline]), during (days 28, 56, and 84), and after (days 28 p, 56 p, and 84 p) treatment for differentiated quantification of unconjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> and taurine-conjugated and glycine-conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> via high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results-Treatment with hydrocortisone for 84 days resulted in significant and reversible increases in the concentrations of unconjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> (ie, cholic, chenodeoxycholic, and deoxycholic acids) and a significant and reversible decrease in the concentration of total taurine-conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids,</b> compared with baseline or control group values. Treatment with hydrocortisone {{had no effect on}} bile concentrations of glycine-conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-In dogs, hydrocortisone administration caused reversible shifts toward higher concentrations of the more hydrophobic unconjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> (chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid) and toward lower concentrations of the amphipathic taurine-conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> in gallbladder <b>bile.</b> These data suggest that similar <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> changes could cause major alterations in gallbladder structure or function over time in hypercortisolemic dogs...|$|R
50|$|Like cholestyramine, {{colestipol}} {{works in}} the gut by trapping <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> and preventing them from being reabsorbed. This leads to decreased enterohepatic recirculation of <b>bile</b> <b>acids,</b> increased synthesis of new <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> by the liver from cholesterol, decreased liver cholesterol, increased LDL receptor expression, and decreasing LDL in blood.|$|R
40|$|Faecal <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> {{and neutral}} sterols of {{cholesterol}} origin {{were decreased in}} patients with chronic liver disease, while urinary <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> were constantly, but never greatly, increased. Thus, production of cholesterol and its conversion to <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> was decreased in these patients. Faecal fat was only slightly increased, even in cases with a very low bile salt output, but it was negatively correlated with faecal <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> The reduced capacity of these patients to synthesize <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> was shown {{by the fact that}} cholestyramine treatment, although it decreased urinary <b>bile</b> <b>acids,</b> increased faecal <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> only slightly. The resin constantly increased faecal neutral sterols, while the increase of faecal fat was insignificant. Thus, the absorption of fats, as compared with that of sterols, was less strongly reduced by interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts. In one cirrhotic patient markedly increased faecal <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> apparently caused cholerrhoeic diarrhoea, which was easily controlled with cholestyramine. The latter consistently increased elimination of cholesterol in cirrhotic patients, but serum cholesterol was not consistently decreased, and in these patients, in contrast to the control subjects, it was difficult to detect changes in cholesterol synthesis with the acetate-mevalonate test and serum methyl sterols...|$|R
25|$|Elevated {{cholesterol}} levels {{are treated with}} a strict diet consisting of low saturated fat, trans fat-free, low cholesterol foods, often followed by one of various hypolipidemic agents, such as statins, fibrates, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, nicotinic acid derivatives or <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> sequestrants. Extreme cases have previously been treated with partial ileal bypass surgery, which has now been superseded by medication. Apheresis-based treatments are still used for very severe hyperlipidemias that are either unresponsive to treatment or require rapid lowering of blood lipids. There are several international guidelines on the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} IBS are not clear. Theories include {{combinations}} of gut–brain axis problems, gut motility disorders, pain sensitivity, infections including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, neurotransmitters, genetic factors, and food sensitivity. Onset may {{be triggered by}} an intestinal infection, or stressful life event. IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms {{in the absence of}} worrisome features. Worrisome features include onset at greater than 50 years of age, weight loss, blood in the stool, or a family history of inflammatory bowel disease. Other conditions that may present similarly include celiac disease, microscopic colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, <b>bile</b> <b>acid</b> malabsorption, and colon cancer.|$|E

40|$|Duodenal <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> {{have been}} {{estimated}} in three age groups in infancy {{from birth to}} 7 months, and age-related changes have been shown. The lowest concentrations of duodenal <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> occurred in the youngest infants, and increasing concentrations were found with increasing age. Taurine conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> predominated in early infancy, while in older infants <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> were mainly conjugated with glycine. The probable presence of taurolithocholic acid in the duodenal bil of 2 newborns before {{the establishment of a}} gastrointestinal microflora remains to be confirmed, but could result either from transplacental passage of secondary <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> or from endogenous synthesis by the fetal liver...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to their roles in facilitating lipid digestion and absorption, <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> are recognized as important regulators of intestinal function. Exposure to <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> can dramatically influence intestinal transport and barrier properties; in recent years, they have also become appreciated as important factors in regulating cell growth and survival. Indeed, few cells reside within the intestinal mucosa that are not altered to some degree by exposure to <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> The past decade saw great advances in the knowledge of how <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> exert their actions at the cellular and molecular levels. In this review, we summarize the current {{understanding of the role}} of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> in regulation of intestinal physiology...|$|R
40|$|Colon {{cancer is}} the second most common type of cancer in the United States. Its {{incidence}} is linked epidemiologically to high levels of <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> in the feces. <b>Bile</b> <b>acids</b> have been implicated as promoters and cocarcinogens in the etiology of colon cancer and as comutagens and mutagens in bacteria. These observations suggest the hypothesis that <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> may damage DNA. By using the DNA-damage inducible SOS system in Escherichia coli, this study shows that when bacteria are exposed to <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> there is induction of the SOS repair system and preferential survival of cells undergoing repair. Additionally, differential killing assays using repair defective bacteria show strains defective in recombinational repair or excision repair have lower survival when treated with <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> than their parental wild-type counterparts. Human fibroblasts were treated with <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> and unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) was measured. UDS is considered to represent the DNA synthesis step in excision repair. UDS, measured by autoradiography, was found to significantly increase in human fibroblasts upon treatment with <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> In addition, differential cytotoxicity assays with Chinese Hamster Ovary cells showed that different DNA-repair pathway defective cells were sensitive to different <b>bile</b> <b>acids.</b> Introduction of DNA damage and induction of DNA-repair by <b>bile</b> <b>acids</b> implicates them as possible direct carcinogens in the etiology of colon cancer...|$|R
