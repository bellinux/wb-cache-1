When a virion binds to the sex pilus {{of a host}} by protein 3 in its <b>beaded</b> <b>end,</b> the pilus retracts and the virus fuses with the host membrane. Several host {{proteins}} {{are involved in this}} step and the genome of the virus is released into the bacterial cytoplasm.|$|E
40|$|Title {{and artist}} from artists' website.; "This book {{refers to the}} origin of stories. Here the {{structure}} of the book aims to symbolically convey the oral tradition of passing on stories, long before the book as a structure came about. The illegibility of the 'mother' story births into being many other smaller stories, rich and intricate in detail. The stories spring about from the main story, escape and reach far, becoming independent tales, yet at this stage in the process are still attached to their roots. The leather cover of the book charts a visual map, a landscape in which the stories travel on. " [...] Artist's website.; Leaves of aquarelle paper, in accordion fold format. Twisted cords with <b>beaded</b> <b>ends</b> loop through each leaf and dangle from the book. Bound in goat-skin wrapper, which is stitched, beaded, and decorated in ink...|$|R

5000|$|... (Original {{description}} by Hedley & Petterd) The {{height of}} the shell attains 12 mm, its diameter 16 mm. The thin shell is rather large and regularly turbinate with an elevated spire. The base of the shell is flattened. The periphery is subangled. The seven whorls increase gradually in size. They are regularly rounded except a narrow flat step below the suture. Colour of the shell is white beneath, and above pale cinnamon with darker radial streaks on the body whorl. The entire surface is glossy, as if well oiled. The sculpture is closely scored by sharp spiral cuts, which are deepest about the periphery, fainter midway up the whorl and vanish from the base and from the first four whorls. On the penultimate whorl between the insertion of the lip and the suture, there are sixteen of these impressed spirals. The flat interspaces are obliquely ci'ossed by faint irregular growth lines. The aperture is very oblique ovate. Its upper insertion is carried far forward, connected with the lower by a thin dull film of callus. The lip is quite sharp, within a white edge {{is followed by a}} brown border anfl that again by a nacreous layer. This sequence again appears along the interior suture. The umbilicus forms a broad open funnel, penetrating to the initial whorl, margined by a <b>beaded</b> funicle which <b>ends</b> in an expansion on the columella base. The interior of the umbilicus is spirally scored like the periphery, and is undercut at the junction of each whorl.|$|R
