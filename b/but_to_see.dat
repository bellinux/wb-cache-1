25|$|After {{taking some}} time off to re-evaluate, Darchinyan knocked out Pakpoom Hammarach in one round on 10 March 2017. The fight was taken by Darchinyan not for the money, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if {{he still had the}} hunger and desire to {{continue}} his boxing career. Taking place in Perth, this would be his last fight in Australia. He has confirmed his next fight will be his last and expressed interest in one more big fight against Evgeny Gradovich in Russia or Carl Frampton in England.|$|E
25|$|In later years, Greg Chappell {{admitted}} that he had been exhausted and stressed after a demanding season of cricket and that, in hindsight, he was not mentally fit to be captain at the time. He had also been on the field through the majority of the match that had been played in stifling hot conditions. At the 40 over mark of the New Zealand innings, Chappell (who had scored 90 in the Australian innings and then bowled 10 overs to the New Zealanders) told wicketkeeper Rod Marsh that he wanted to leave the field. Marsh, who described Chappell as being physically spent and exhausted, said that wasn't possible and that Chappell had no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> out the match. Despite being captain and arranging bowling changes and field placings, Chappell spent several overs fielding on the boundary because he felt overwhelmed by the conditions and the pressure of the situation.|$|E
25|$|After {{being raised}} by Mukhtar Begum, Rani {{moved in with her}} mother with whom she was reconciled. After her initial success in late 60's, she married renowned {{director}} Hassan Tariq, of whom she had a daughter Rabia. Due to conflicts Hassan Tariq divorced Rani in the late 70's. She then married to producer Mian Javed Qamar, who divorced her when it was discovered that Rani had cancer. During her treatment in London, she met famous cricketer Sarfaraz Nawaz. Soon they developed a good relationship with each other and got married. Rani helped Sarfraz in his election campaign in late 80's. But their relationship also did not last long and they parted. After getting divorced for the third time, Rani was struck by the grief of loneliness. Cancer also struck back and this time with much more intensity as Rani did not have much desire to live <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her daughter married.|$|E

25|$|Cave di Cusa (The Quarries of Cusa) {{are made}} up of banks of {{limestone}} near Campobello di Mazara, thirteen kilometres from Selinus. They were the stone quarries from which the material for the buildings of Selinus came. The most notable element of the quarries is the sudden interruption of operations caused by the attack on the city in 409BC. The sudden departure of the quarrymen, stonemasons and other workers means that today it is possible not just to reconsturct, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> all the various stages of the quarrying process from the first deep circular cuts to the finished drums waiting to be transported. Along with the column drums, there are also some capitals and also square incisions for quarrying square blocks, all intended for the temples of Selinus. Of the drums that had already been extracted, some were found ready for transport and others, already on the way to Selinus were abandoned on the road. Some gigantic columns, definitely intended for Temple G, are found in the area west of Cave di Cusa, also in the state in which they were originally abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The Super Kings played Mumbai Indians in the Eliminator at Bangalore. After losing two early wickets, Hussey and Badrinath {{shared a}} 94-run third-wicket {{partnership}} {{to take the}} team to a respectable position. Then, the skipper MS Dhoni and Dwayne Bravo scored 73 runs {{in the last five}} overs to set up a score of 187/5 in 20 overs. Mumbai in their run-chase got off to a brisk start before a dramatic batting collapse. CSK spinners Ashwin and Jakati picked up one wicket each and bowled seven economical overs between them that proved decisive {{in the context of the}} match. CSK won the match by 38 runs and Dhoni was given the Man of the Match for his innings of 51* (20). The win took them to the second Qualifier at Chennai, a match against Delhi Daredevils, to decide who plays in the final. Daredevils won the toss and put Chennai into bat and this decision backfired. Opener Murali Vijay, who had a quiet season until then, came to his own striking a century (113 runs from 60 deliveries, 15 fours and four sixes) to take his team to 222/5. The bowlers backed up the good batting by bowling tight line and length and picking up wickets at regular intervals. Only Mahela Jayawardene showed some resistance for Delhi with a knock of 55 <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his team lose by 86 runs. The win booked CSK's place in the final at their home ground Chennai against the Kolkata Knight Riders. This was the fourth time in five seasons, that CSK had made it to the final of the IPL.|$|E

[...] At the fourth Nokia Music Connect video conference, Chopra said that the commercial numbers for [...] "In My City" [...] were all the more surprising, since the music sales in the Indian market is not that much. Universal Music MD, India, Saarc Devraj Sanyal said that the label was surprised with the instant sales of the song. [...] "We have been in the non-film music business for a while and I must admit to mounting engines across all platforms that have been fired like never before on Priyanka's global single debut. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> these results so quickly is beyond gratifying," [...] Sanyal said, before saying that the single debut would be followed by many promotional campaigns targeting different multimedia facets.|$|E
500|$|Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York {{referred}} {{to being a}} [...] "must-see danceumentary." [...] Rothkopf described Jackson as [...] "obviously" [...] having been [...] "shooting for the moon right before his death" [...] {{based on what he}} could tell from the [...] "stunning bits of concert spectacle" [...] of [...] "phalanxes of computer-generated dancers, tempo changes on a dime, a bombshell of a blond guitarist who plays Eddie Van Halen's [...] "Beat It" [...] solo flawlessly". Rothkopf stated that: [...] "But the true value of this raw rehearsal footage is its emphasis, less known, on MJ's laserlike attention to detail, as he works his band and troupe up to speed. A firm floor manager himself, he's often exposed — and probably wouldn't have approved of this film. (One on one, High School Musicals Kenny Ortega, meanwhile, treats him with kid gloves: [...] "I agree, Michael.") <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him sweetly lose himself in [...] "Human Nature" [...] ("I like living this way...") is to feel a creature of the stage finally returned home, and possibly on the cusp of redemption." [...] Peter Paras, of E! Online felt that watching Jackson and his performances in a positive aspect is the [...] "genius and the sadness of the entire film." [...] He did note that Jackson's performance of [...] "Earth Song," [...] which consists of using Jackson's voiceover to emphasize his environmental concerns while a bulldozer threatens to eat him, was well-intentioned — because it brought attention to environmental concerns — but felt it was a little over the top. Paras felt the film showed an [...] "exacting and refreshingly funny side of Jackson to be revealed" [...] and [...] "had Jackson lived, we never would have seen those moments" [...] and felt the film was a proper way to [...] "finally say goodbye" [...] to Jackson.|$|E

500|$|The medal's {{order of}} {{precedence}} was criticized by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The commander of this organization, John Hamilton, explained, [...] "It {{is very important to}} properly recognize all who faithfully serve and excel, but this new medal – no matter how well intended – could quickly deteriorate into a morale issue. Medals that can only be earned in direct combat must mean more than medals awarded in the rear." [...] The Military Order of the Purple Heart joined in condemnation, stating [...] "To rank what is basically an award for meritorious service higher than any award for heroism is degrading and insulting to every American Combat Soldier, Airman, Sailor or Marine who risks his or her life and endures the daily rigors of combat in a hostile environment. The Military Order of the Purple Heart strongly urges the newly appointed Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to either reconsider the precedence of the Distinguished Warfare Medal or develop another way to recognize the achievements of those whose indirect actions contribute greatly to the accomplishment of the mission without diminishing the sacrifice of life and limb by those who confront the enemy firsthand on the battlefield." [...] The Association of the United States Navy also expressed criticism of the medal's placement, stating [...] "While AUSN supports the medal itself, as well as the achievements and importance of the cyber warfare community, the concern lies with the ranking of the medal." [...] Doug Sterner, military medals expert and curator of the Military Times Hall of Valor, expressed confusion, saying, [...] "I understand the need to recognize the guys at the console who are doing some pretty important things. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it ranking above the Bronze Star (with) V?" [...] Nick McDowell, a member of the Orders and Medals Society of America said that an alternative to adding a new medal could be adding a new ribbon device to an existing medal, and said that [...] "The problem is that we're adding another non-valor personal decoration into a system that is already crowded with non-valor personal decorations." ...|$|E

[...] Erika Ramirez of the same publication placed the performance at number two on her list of Beyoncé's five biggest TV performances.

Morey admitted that she was [...] "shocked" [...] and [...] "stunned" [...] when the producers {{told her about the}} development for her character. She questioned how the storyline would come together, since there had never been any indication that Sonya was Callum's mother before. Morey explained [...] "Initially, I thought, 'How could this work – Sonya being Callum's mum?', but then I realised it does work. All of a sudden, it creates even more depth and complexity to Sonya and the decisions she's made and her motivations for things like forgiving Toadie for his and Steph's sham marriage. There's this whole other layer." [...] Morey called the storyline [...] "phenomenal" [...] and noted that it would change everything that viewers thought they knew about why Sonya became part of Toadie and Callum's lives. Morey researched how other people had reacted to similar situations and came to realise that the pieces fall into place, despite it being [...] "a leap." [...] She stated that Sonya had entered Callum's life, not to get him back, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if he was okay. However, she then fell in love with Toadie. The actress believed that it was not Sonya's intention to [...] "plant herself in their lives", but it just happened.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{as well as}} {{attacking the}} {{theories}} of empiricism, Blake also engages {{with the concept of}} natural religion. Northrop Frye argues that [...] "Theology distinguishes between [...] "natural" [...] and [...] "revealed" [...] religion, the former being the vision of God which man develops with his fallen reason, and the later the vision communicated to him by inspired prophets. To Blake, there is no natural religion. The only reason people believe in it is because they are unwilling to believe in the identity of God and Man." [...] For Harold Bloom, because Blake is able to see the identity of God and man, the rejection of Locke and the tenets of deism makes way for a system in which [...] "to see the infinite in all things is to see God because it is to see as God sees, which Blake believes {{is the only way to}} see God. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> as God sees, man must himself be infinite, a state to be attained only by the individual utterly possessed by the Poetic character." [...] Similarly, [...] "there is no natural religion, according to Blake, because no man reasoning from fallen nature can come to see that [...] "the real man, the imagination" [...] and God are the same. Religion must be [...] "revealed" [...] in the sense that Revelation means the consuming of natural appearance by a more imaginative vision." [...] Along these same lines, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi argue that, for Blake, natural religion is a [...] "contradiction in terms antithetical to religious belief. Natural religion is derived from experience provided by the fallen senses, not from the Poetic Genius. Thus it is not a religion and cannot be included in the 'all' of All Religions are One." ...|$|E
