The country was skipped {{for the next}} five tours until the singer {{released}} her thirteenth studio album, Rebel Heart (2015).

The show was billed as an intimate gig, and was described by the singer as a fusion of music, art and comedy. It was titled as Madonna: Tears of a Clown show and was created for the singer's Australian fans, who had waited for her to perform there for the last 23 years. During her promotional appearance at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April 2015, Madonna confessed that she is a [...] "kind of closet comedian" [...] and did a skit on the show; she added, [...] "I always do extravaganzas, they always cost a billion dollars to make ... nobody makes any money ... and sometimes I dream about simplicity."

According to newspaper reports, the tickets were non-transferable, and had the person's name printed on them. However, all of them were in the general admission category at Forum Theatre, which holds a maximum capacity of 1,500. With the production design and addition of catwalk, the space allocated became smaller than that. Prior to the show The Sydney Morning Herald reported that fans started queuing up in front of the venue, while Madonna rehearsed inside, as well as at Hisense Arena. Images and songs rehearsed were leaked to fan website Drownedmadonna.com, along with Madonna's manager Guy Oseary uploading pictures on Instagram.

40|$|In {{the spring}} of 2008, I was a senior who could almost taste the summer when I would have my bachelor’s degree in hand.

Since our program’s curriculum was so general, we discussed technology in only the broadest terms. One day, I ran across an article on a concept that I had never heard before: cloud computing. When I brought it up in class and explained it, my teacher dismissed the idea as juvenile because of course nothing would ever replace desktop applications! Nor did she see any reason as to why people would want their data to be stored externally. I kept my head down and did not bother to challenge her beliefs. In that program of study, she was probably correct; you cannot do advance video editing via streaming since we regularly crashed the <b>brand</b> <b>spanking</b> new Macs in our projects.
