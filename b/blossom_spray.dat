60|$|In {{the weather}} he had struck a cold wave, {{and the wind}} was bitter in the streets, but they were full of sun; he found the grass green in {{sheltered}} places, {{and in one of}} the Circles he plucked a <b>blossomed</b> <b>spray</b> from an adventurous forceythia. This happened when he was walking from Wormley's to the Arlington by a roundabout way of his own involuntary invention, and he had the flowers in his button-hole when Lafflin was pointed out to him in the reading room there, and he introduced himself. Lafflin had put his hat far back on his head, and was intensely chewing a toothpick, with an air of rapture from everything about him. He seemed a very simple soul to Dan's inexperience of men, and the young fellow had no difficulty in committing him to a fair conditional arrangement. He was going to stay some days in Washington, and he promised other interviews, so that Dan thought it best to stay too. He used a sheet of the Arlington letter-paper in writing his father of what he had done; and then, as Lafflin had left him, he posted his letter at the clerk's desk, and wandered out through a corridor different from that which he had come in by. It led by the door of the ladies parlour, and at the sound of women's voices Dan halted. For no other reason than that such voices always irresistibly allured him, he went in, putting on an air of having come to look for some one. There were two or three groups of ladies receiving friends {{in different parts of the}} room. At the window a girl's figure silhouetted itself against the keen light, and as he advanced into the room, peering about, it turned with a certain vividness that seemed familiar. This young lady, whoever she was, had the advantage of Dan in seeing him with the light on his face, and he was still in the dark about her, when she advanced swiftly upon him, holding out her hand.|$|R
50|$|Gibberellic acid is {{sometimes}} used in laboratory and greenhouse settings to trigger germination in seeds {{that would otherwise}} remain dormant. It is also widely used in the grape-growing industry as a hormone to induce the production of larger bundles and bigger grapes, especially Thompson seedless grapes. In the Okanagan and Creston valleys, it is also used as a growth replicator in the cherry industry. It is used on Clementine Mandarin oranges, which may otherwise cross-pollinate with other citrus and grow undesirable seeds. Applied directly on the <b>blossoms</b> as a <b>spray,</b> it allows for Clementines to produce a full crop of fruit without seeds.|$|R

Intraspecilic crosses and backcrosses made with susceptible Phaseolus vulgaris germplasm indicate that a single completely dominant gene governs this high level of resistance. The symbol Ws is proposed for this gene. The inoculation procedure used to evaluate bean germplasm simulated natural disease occurrence in commercial bean fields.

40|$|Competitive {{exclusion}} {{has been}} the mechanism hypothesized {{to account for the}} biological control of fire blight disease of pear and apple by the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens A 506 (A 506). Recent laboratory assays demonstrated, however, that A 506 produces an antibiotic that is toxic to the fire blight pathogen, Erwinia amylovora, when cultured on media amended with iron (Fe 2 or Fe 3). This study investigated this iron-dependent antibiosis by A 506 by: 1) examining bioavailability of iron to A 506 on blossom surfaces, 2) mutagenizing A 506 to disrupt genes involved in antibiotic production, and 3) evaluating suppression of fire blight by A 506 when co-treated with an iron chelate (FeEDDHA). Bioavailability of iron on blossoms was investigated with an iron biosensor [iron-regulated promoter (pvd) fused to an ice nucleation reporter gene (inaZ) ] in A 506. A 506 (pvd-inaZ) expressed high ice nucleation activity (INA) on blossoms indicating a low-iron environment unlikely to induce antibiosis by A 506.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} has been to investigate the efficiency of chemical preparations and their sustainability of apple cultivars against powdery mildew pathogen (Podosphaeraleucotricha). Three cultivars of apple (Jonathan, Idared and Vizajka-native cultivars) have been tested in experimental fields (in the municipality of Peja, Kosovo) during the two years of research (2013 - 2014). Fungicides that are used were: Webeton (triadimefon), Rubigan (fenarimol), Karathan EC (dinocap) and Kossan WG (sulfur). During the vegetation has been made eight spraying, three <b>spraying</b> before the <b>blossoming</b> and five <b>spraying</b> after the <b>blossoming,</b> within a period of 10 - 15 days between spraying and sprinkling. After that, there have been done three evaluations {{of the disease and}} the results obtained have been processed according to Mc Kinney index. Through the processed results has been seen that higher efficiency of chemical preparations has been in the Webeton and Karathan combination EC (variant- B 2) and in Rubigan and Karathan combination EC (variant- B 1), during the two years of the research. Whereas, regarding the suitability of cultivars to pathogen, cultivar “Vizajka ” (native cultivar) showed the highest sustainability against disease pathogen, where, the index in the first and second year of the research has been lower in all variants as well as to control compared to two other cultivars. While, the most sensitive cultivar against powdery mildew pathogen was Jonathan with the higher disease index compared with two other cultivars...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Competitive {{exclusion}} {{has been}} the mechanism hypothesized {{to account for the}} biological control of fire blight disease of pear and apple by the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens A 506 (A 506). Recent laboratory assays demonstrated, however, that A 506 produces an antibiotic that is toxic to the fire blight pathogen, Erwinia amylovora, when cultured on media amended with iron (Fe⁺² or Fe⁺³). This study investigated this iron-dependent antibiosis by A 506 by: 1) examining bioavailability of iron to A 506 on blossom surfaces, 2) mutagenizing A 506 to disrupt genes involved in antibiotic production, and 3) evaluating suppression of fire blight by A 506 when co-treated with an iron chelate (FeEDDHA). Bioavailability of iron on blossoms was investigated with an iron biosensor [iron-regulated promoter (pvd) fused to an ice nucleation reporter gene (inaZ) ] in A 506.

Transposon mutagenesis was used to generate and select mutants of A 506 exhibiting altered antibiotic production profiles. One antibiotic-deficient mutant, A 506 Ant⁻, was recovered; this mutant showed reduced epiphytic fitness on blossoms of apple and pear trees compared to the parent stain, A 506. Another mutant, A 506 Ant⁺, lost the characteristic fluorescent phenotype and exhibited iron-independent antibiotic production in defined culture media. A 506 Ant⁺ established high populations on blossoms of apple and pear trees, similar to populations attained by A 506, and reduced incidence of fire blight between 20 to 40...|$|R
6000|$|... § XXXII. Observe, however, {{and this}} is of the utmost {{possible}} importance, {{that the value of}} this type does not consist in the mere shutting of the ornament into a certain space, but in the acknowledgment by the ornament of the fitness of the limitation--of its own perfect willingness to submit to it; nay, of a predisposition in itself to fall into the ordained form, without any direct expression of the command to do so; an anticipation of the authority, and an instant and willing submission to it, in every fibre and spray: not merely willing, but happy submission, as being pleased rather than vexed to have so beautiful a law suggested to it, and one which to follow is so justly in accordance with its own nature. You must not cut out a branch of hawthorn as it grows, and rule a triangle round it, and suppose that it is then submitted to law. Not a bit of it. It is only put in a cage, and will look as if it must get out, for its life, or wither in the confinement. But the spirit of triangle must be put into the hawthorn. It must suck in isoscelesism with its sap. Thorn and <b>blossom,</b> leaf and <b>spray,</b> must grow with an awful sense of triangular necessity upon them, for the guidance of which they are to be thankful, and to grow all the stronger and more gloriously. And though there may be a transgression here and there, and an adaptation to some other need, or a reaching forth to some other end greater even than the triangle, yet this liberty is to be always accepted under a solemn sense of special permission; and when the full form is reached and the entire submission expressed, and every blossom has a thrilling sense of its responsibility down into its tiniest stamen, you may take your terminal line away if you will. No need for it any more. The commandment is written on the heart of the thing.|$|R
40|$|Sodium {{chlorate}} {{has proved}} {{the most effective}} herbicide for the eradication of leafy spurge. The following formula is effective when applied as a spray: Sodium chlorate, 1 pound; animal glue, 4 grams; sulfuric acid, 3 cubic centimeters; water, 1 gallon. The best kill was obtained when the chlorate solution was sprayed on actively growing plants in full foliage. In northwestern Iowa, sodium chlorate sprayed on the aerial parts has given better and more consistent results than when applied dry, directly to the soil. The highest percentage of kill of leafy spurge through sodium chlorate was produced when the spray was applied {{the latter part of}} May or when the plant was about to come into <b>blossom.</b> The second <b>spray,</b> applied the latter part of August or before killing frost, usually completed the eradication of leafy spurge. Sodium chlorate has proved more effective in killing leafy spurge when treated in small grain or millet than where growing alone. Leafy spurge was eliminated in a large pasture by spraying with sodium chlorate, the first application being made the latter part of May and the second the latter part of August. Pound for pound, the old Atlacide on the market in 1930 - 33 apparently was not as effective in killing leafy spurge as sodium chlorate. Dilute sulfuric acid and C. -K. (creosote-kerosene) killed the tops of leafy spurge with little injury to the roots. Heavy applications of ammonium thiocyanate may prove valuable as a herbicide for leafy spurge. Potassium chlorate was about as effective in eradicating leafy spurge as sodium chlorate. Residual soil effect was greater for potassium chlorate than for sodium chlorate. To insure complete elimination of leafy spurge by spraying with sodium chlorate, 2 years are necessary. Two applications the first year will destroy most of the spurge. Remaining plants must be given two treatments the second year. Kainite, a fertilizer, will exterminate leafy spurge when heavy applications are made. Applications of well rotted manure (3 tons to the square rod) were effective against leafy spurge. Straw had no effect. Plowing leafy spurge deeply (7 - 8 inches) in the fall and again in the spring materially reduced the amount of leafy spurge. Millet, sorghum and soybeans drilled in heavily about the middle of June after the ground had been plowed and fallowed proved to be good crops for infested areas of leafy spurge. Reduction in leafy spurge population is greater if the land is plowed the preceding fall and again the following spring, and cultivated until the smother crop is planted. Fallowing for 2 years, by cultivating 30 times each year from June 1 until Oct. 1, completely destroyed leafy spurge. A program of eradication with growing competitive crops may be shortened by giving leafy spurge one application of sodium chlorate the previous fall, shortly before killing frost. Leafy spurge population in corn was not reduced by four cultivations. Surface cultivation in corn following regular cultivation did not prove to be an effective procedure in eradicating leafy spurge. Alfalfa did not compete successfully with leafy spurge. Alfalfa was tolerant to sodium chlorate and may be used on ground where the leafy spurge has been killed with sodium chlorate or Atlacide. Barley was sensitive to sodium chlorate in the soil; soybeans are less tolerant than barley or oats...|$|R
