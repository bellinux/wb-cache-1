The temperatures induced in the components are here analysed with particular focus on the cooling influence from the rolling contact between the hot wheel and a cold rail. Controlled brake rig tests are reported, where the rolling contact is studied using a so-called rail-wheel {{in contact with the}} braked wheel, along with results from field tests. The data from these experimental studies are used for calibration of a simulation tool for calculation of wheel and block temperatures. The calibrated model analyses heat partitioning between <b>block,</b> <b>wheel</b> and rail and finds the resulting temperatures at braking. The rail chill is found to have a considerable influence on the wheel temperatures for long drag braking cycles.

40|$|The {{temperature}} rise of wheels and blocks due to frictional heating during railway tread braking {{along with the}} transfer of heat through the wheel–rail contact is studied in this paper. In particular, heat partitioning between <b>block,</b> <b>wheel</b> and rail for stop braking cycles is considered. The wheels are of interest because they are a limiting factor for railway tread braking systems. Two types of thermal models are employed to investigate the maximum temperatures over the wheel tread. In a circumferential (plane) model of wheel, block and rail, the heat transfer problem is studied by use of a finite element formulation of the two-dimensional time-dependent convection–diffusion equation. The hot spot phenomenon is simulated by introducing a prescribed wheel-fixed contact pressure distribution between wheel and block. In an axisymmetric (axial) model of wheel, block and rail, the lateral movements of the wheel–rail contact are studied. A general {{result is that the}} cooling effect provided by the rail is important when local temperatures on the tread are considered, but not when studying bulk temperatures created in a single stop braking event. Furthermore, it is found from the lateral movements of the wheel–rail contact that slow oscillations result in maximum temperatures over the wheel tread that are somewhat lower than for travelling on straight track (rolling at the rolling circle) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the cognitive levels of play and the child selected play activities of younger and older preschool children. Hypotheses were formulated to examine this relationship, and the age and sex differences in the cognitive levels of play and the child-selected play activities. The Play Activity Observation Instrument (PAOI) was developed by the researcher. From Smilansky's cognitive levels of play, the PAOI assessed functional, constructive, and dramatic play. Modifying Rubin' s list of the most frequently observed preschool play activities, the PAOI assessed family-work, art, <b>block,</b> <b>wheel</b> toy, table, sand-water, and climbing play. The subjects, twenty-two males and twenty-two females, were enrolled in two preschool programs at a midwestern university. The younger group had a mean age of 41. 8 months and the older group had a mean age of 54. 0 months. Agreement among the seven trained observers, using was. 7564. Data were collected three days a week for six weeks during thirty-minute observation periods. A multivariate analysis of variance used the sex and age of the subjects as the classification variables, and the cognitive levels of play exhibited in the child-selected play activities as the dependent variables. Post hoc analysis, using univariate techniques, was conducted to further interpret the results. Statistical analysis of the mean frequencies of cognitive levels of play exhibited in the child-selected play activities revealed the following results:Significant age differences were found for the cognitive levels of play (p<. 0450) : older children engaged in more dramatic play. No significant age differences were found for functional or constructive play. No significant age differences were found for the child-selected play activities (p. 1214). No significant sex differences were found for the cognitive levels of play (p<. 0889). Significant sex differences were found for the child selected play activities (p. 0001), and for the child selected play activities by cognitive levels of play interaction (p<. 0001). Sex differences could be interpreted only when examining specific child-selected play activities: (A) no sex differences were observed for family-work play; however, both sexes exhibited higher levels of dramatic family-work play and lower levels of functional and constructive family-work play; (B) females exhibited higher levels of constructive art play; (C) males exhibited higher levels of constructive and dramatic block play; (D) males exhibited higher levels of dramatic wheel toy play; (E) no sex differences wore found for table play or sand-water play; (F) males engaged in more dramatic climbing play. Significant differences were found for the overall child-selected play activities by cognitive levels of play interaction (p<. 0001). Post hoc analysis indicated that there was more dramatic family-work play than functional or constructive family-work play, more constructive table play than functional or dramatic table play, and more constructive sand-water play than functional or dramatic sand-water play. Several educational implications were presented, including the following:Dramatic play has been linked to later symbolic functioning in creativity, problem solving and reading. This study indicated that the greatest potential for dramatic play occurred in family-work play. Since art, <b>block,</b> <b>wheel</b> toy, and climbing play evoked sex differences in the cognitive levels of play, teachers should encourage cross-sex play behaviors in these activities.

40|$|Block braking is a {{commonly}} used braking system for freight wagons {{and other types}} of railway vehicles. One or several brake blocks are pressed against the tread (running surface) of the wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The kinetic energy of the running train is then transformed into heat, which is partitioned between block(s) and wheel and is conducted from block to block holder and from wheel to rail and also dissipated into the surroundings by convection and radiation. During the last decade, one aspect of block braking has become an environmental issue: the high rolling noise levels generated by trains with block braked wheels. A roughness (corrugation, waviness) develops on the wheel tread during the sliding contact between block and wheel, and this tread roughness (out-of-roundness) induces vibrations and noise when the train rolls. The roughness level strongly depends on the properties of the brake block material. Here cast iron blocks generate higher roughness levels than do composite and sinter blocks. In Europe, cast iron is presently the most commonly used brake block material on freight wagons, but composite and sinter materials are now gradually being introduced. In {{the first part of the}} present thesis, the thermomechanical interaction between brake block and wheel tread is studied to search for the mechanisms behind the growth of wheel roughness. The evolution of hot spots, i e areas on the wheel tread with significantly higher temperature than the rest of the tread, is believed to be a key phenomenon that can explain the differences between the different block materials. Results from full-scale tread braking experiments with forged wheels in an inertia dynamometer are reported. A numerical model for studying the thermoelastic contact between brake block and wheel tread demonstrates the principal phenomena. Also, results from field measurements of wheel roughness are presented. The tendency of cast iron brake blocks to generate high roughness levels on wheel treads has propelled a general shift away from cast iron to other materials which do not give disturbing roughness levels. However, this change of block material will affect the heat partitioning between wheel and block. Excessive heating of the wheel may cause damage and may result in problems with axial deflection of the wheel rim (change of wheelset gauge). High tensile stresses in the wheel rim after its cooling down can lead to initiation and growth of transverse cracks in the wheel rim. In the second part of the present thesis, a thermal model of railway tread braking is developed for use in routine calculations of wheel and block temperatures, including the cooling influence from the rail. Brake rig tests have been performed for drag braking at constant brake power for blocks made of cast iron and sinter and composite materials. Results on the influence of block configuration, brake power and brake speed on wheel and block temperatures are reported. Rolling contact heat transfer from wheel to rail is studied in the brake rig using a so-called rail-wheel in contact with the braked wheel, along with results from field tests. The model has been calibrated by using data from the experiments and can be employed to calculate temperatures and the heat partitioning between <b>block,</b> <b>wheel</b> and rail. The rail chill is found to have a considerable influence on the wheel temperature for long brake cycles. The present model can be used to efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains. It can handle stop braking, drag braking at constant brake power, and also intermediate periods of cooling. The temperature history during a full train route can thus be calculated...|$|E

40|$|Roughness (corrugation, waviness) having {{circumferential}} {{wavelengths of}} 20 to 200 mm on the tread {{surface of a}} running railway wheel leads to vibrations in wheels, bogies and superstructure and also in rails, sleepers and roadbed.

Two-dimensional finite-element models of <b>block(s)</b> and <b>wheel</b> are coupled via a contact interface that controls the heat generation and also the heat partitioning between <b>block</b> and <b>wheel</b> through thermal contact resistances. The surface temperature variations around the wheel circumference as caused by frictional heating and intermediate cooling are accounted for in a mean sense, assuming high-speed sliding conditions. The thermal power generated at the block-wheel interface during braking is determined from train braking data. A model for heat transfer from the rolling wheel into the rail is developed where a film with thermal contact resistance is placed at the wheel-rail contact interface. The present model {{can be used to}} efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains.

40|$|Aluminium {{die-casting}} {{is widely}} used in the automotive industry. Brackets, engine <b>blocks,</b> <b>wheels</b> and suspension arms etc. are typical applications. Due to the gases contained in the melt, more or less spherical pores arise in the cast components during the cooling procedure, usually with a higher concentration in the middle. The distribution of the pores depends both on the casting condition and on {{the form of the}} components and is stochastic. In the past, the simple way is often chosen for the fatigue life estimation of aluminium die-casting: The fatigue strengths of the material, e. g. in the form of S-N curves, are determined by an unnotched specimen which are then used in the fatigue calculation. However, the application of these data to real components with notches leads in many cases to fatigue life estimations which are by far too conservative. In the present paper a simple geometrical model of pores is presented. Using this model, the notch stress caused by a pore can be estimated. The behaviour of pores in a real component with notches will be treated. It will be shown that the mentioned conservative nature of the fatigue life prediction and the apparent notch insensitivity of aluminium die-casting {{can be explained by the}} facts that the stress distribution in a real component, contrary to an unnotched specimen, is inhomogeneous and that the porosity density on the surface is often low...|$|R
