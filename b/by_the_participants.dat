5|$|The {{programme}} included 22 participants, four of whom {{left the}} programme voluntarily whilst {{the fate of}} the others was decided by the public vote. The housemates were originally competing to win a £100,000 prize but, due to rule-breaking <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants,</b> this was reduced to £71,320. The series, which was sponsored by Lucozade, achieved significantly less media coverage and viewing figures, resulting in it becoming the least-watched series in Big Brother UK history until Big Brother 12 in 2011. This series also attracted controversy, with accusations of bullying between contestants drawing complaints and criticisms levelled at the welfare of housemates after they left the programme.|$|E

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that humour is {{associated}} with satisfaction and conflict management in dyadic relationships, such as friendships and romantic relationships. However, humour is not inherently positive or negative in itself. The function of humour depends on the style through which it is expressed. Adaptive uses of humour, especially affiliative humour, are positively correlated with relationship satisfaction and conflict management. Maladaptive uses of humour, particularly aggressive humour, have the opposite effect. The current study examined daily changes in humour use, relationship satisfaction, and conflict {{over a period of}} ten days in participants who were in a dating relationship. As hypothesized, affiliative humour, used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> partner as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant,</b> was positively correlated with relationship satisfaction on a day-to-day basis. Daily aggressive humour used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> partner as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> was negatively correlated with daily relationship satisfaction. However, no significant association was found between aggressive humour used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> and relationship satisfaction. Conflict was negatively correlated with relationship satisfaction on a daily basis. And finally, daily affiliative humour was found to have a moderating effect on the relationship between conflict and relationship satisfaction, though a moderating effect was not found for daily aggressive humour...|$|R

30|$|This {{observation}} made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> ties in {{well with}} Abor and Quartey (2010) revelation that the small-scale businesses in Ghana lack requisite finance or credit {{to do their}} businesses.

Lack of funds or credits for small businesses has been re-echoed by Todaro (1997) and Todaro and Smith (2009).

The human studies carried out in Holmesburg failed to follow Dow's original protocol and lacked proper informed consent <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants.</b> As a result of poor study design and subsequent destruction of records, the tests were virtually worthless even though ten inmates were exposed to 7,500μg of TCDD.|$|E
