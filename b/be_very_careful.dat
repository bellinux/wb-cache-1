5|$|The Wolds area {{takes the}} form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by {{numerous}} deep, steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys of glacial origin. The chalk formation of the hills provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys are dry. Surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. At Flamborough Head the Wolds rise up to form high chalk cliffs, where there are water-worn caves and stacks along the shore. Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. Coastal erosion around Flamborough Head has led to visitors being warned by the Humber Coastguard to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> on coastal paths.|$|E
25|$|During the {{majority}} of the year caribou roam the tundra in small herds, but twice a year large herds of caribou cross the inland regions. Caribou have excellent senses of smell and hearing so that the hunters must <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> when in pursuit. Often, Inuit hunters set up camp miles away from the caribou crossing and wait until they are in full view to attack. There are many ways in which the caribou can be captured, including spearing, forcing caribou into the river, using blinders, scaring the caribou, and stalking the caribou. When spearing caribou, hunters put the string of the spear in their mouths and the other end they use to gently spear the animal.|$|E
25|$|A much milder acid than tartaric and malic, {{lactic acid}} is often {{associated}} with “milky” flavors in wine and is the primary acid of yogurt and sauerkraut. It is produced during winemaking by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which includes three genera: Oenococcus, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus. These bacteria convert both sugar and malic acid into lactic acid, the latter through MLF. This process can be beneficial for some wines, adding complexity and softening the harshness of malic acidity, but it can generate off flavors and turbidity in others. Some strains of LAB can produce biogenic amines, such as histamine, tyramine and putrescine, which may be a cause of red wine headaches in some wine drinkers. Winemakers wishing to control or prevent MLF can use sulfur dioxide to stun the bacteria. Racking the wine quickly off its lees will also help control the bacteria, since lees are a vital food source for them. The winemakers must also <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> of what wine barrels and winemaking equipment to which the wine is exposed, because of the bacteria's ability to deeply embed themselves within wood fibers. A wine barrel that has completed one successful malolactic fermentation will almost always induce MLF in every wine stored in it from then on.|$|E

500|$|From early childhood, Shackleton was a {{voracious}} reader, a pursuit which {{sparked a}} passion for adventure. He was schooled by a governess {{until the age of}} eleven, when he began at Fir Lodge Preparatory School in West Hill, Dulwich, in southeast London. At the age of thirteen, he entered Dulwich College. The young Shackleton did not particularly distinguish himself as a scholar, and was said to be [...] "bored" [...] by his studies. He was quoted later as saying: [...] "I never learned much geography at school... Literature, too, consisted in the dissection, the parsing, the analysing of certain passages from our great poets and prose-writers... teachers should <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> not to spoil [...] taste for poetry for all time by making it a task and an imposition." [...] In his final term at the school he was still able to achieve fifth place in his class of thirty-one.|$|E
500|$|With {{an exaggerated}} and unusual batting style, Bagwell waited for each pitch {{in a low}} crouch, with legs wide open and knees bent nearly 90 degrees, {{appearing}} {{as if he was}} sitting on an invisible bench. [...] He stepped back with his front foot as he began his swing. [...] Next, he would rise from his stance and rotate his hands with the bat forward into his powerful, uppercut swing. [...] "That wide stance keeps him from over striding", Joe Torre observed, [...] "which can be your biggest problem when you’re trying to hit for power." [...] The low crouch also shrunk his strike zone, allowing him to walk more often. [...] Standing 6 feet tall (...) and weighing , he did not present the image of an imposing, home run-hitting giant that would cause pitchers to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> when he batted after he began his major league career.|$|E

500|$|During production, {{the film}} {{underwent}} two name changes. The project was initially titled Seven, which became Ek Bataa Saat and finally 7 Khoon Maaf. In the film, Chopra's character ages from 20 to 65, and prosthetic makeup {{was used for}} her looks at different ages. Bhardwaj hired Hollywood special makeup effects artist Greg Cannom, who did the makeup for 2008's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, to create seven looks for the character. Chopra found the most challenging period {{was that of the}} 65-year-old woman. The actress said, [...] "prosthetics had to play a heavy part but I’m happy that I pushed myself as the result is really fab. I had to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> of not doing things that would damage the make-up". To make Chopra look authentic, the makeup team used Chopra's mother's and grandmother’s photos to create her look. She had to gain five kg weight to fit her aging character.|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} day only 7,669 Allied {{soldiers}} were evacuated, {{but by the end}} of the eighth day, 338,226 of them had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 boats. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective mole onto 39 British Royal Navy destroyer, 4 Royal Canadian Navy destroyers, and a variety of civilian merchant ships, while others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what came to be known as the little ships of Dunkirk, a flotilla of hundreds of merchant marine boats, fishing boats, pleasure craft, yachts, and lifeboats called into service from Britain. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment.
