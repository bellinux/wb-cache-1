5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several <b>bottom-living</b> <b>fish</b> such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E

40|$|Lates calcarifer (Bloch), {{commonly}} known as giant sea perch or Asian seabass, is an economically important food fish in the tropical and subtropical regions in the Asia –Pacific. They are medium to large-sized <b>bottom-living</b> <b>fishes</b> occurring in coastal seas, estuaries and lagoons in depths between 10 and 50 m. They are highly esteemed food and sport fishes taken mainly by artisanal fishermen. Because of its relatively high market value, {{it has become an}} attractive commodity of both large to small-scale aquaculture enterprises. It is important as a commercial and subsistence food fish but also is a game fish. The most important commercial fish of Australia, and the most sought after game fish, generates millions of dollars per year in revenue for the sport fishing. Lates calcarifer, known as seabass in Asia and barramundi in Australia, is a euryhaline member of the family Centropomidae that is widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific region from the Arabian Gulf to China, Taiwan Province of China, Papua New Guinea and northern Australia. Aquaculture of this species commenced in the 1970 s in Thailand, and rapidly spread throughout much of Southeast Asia...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{neoplasms}} and nonneoplastic hepatic lesions {{have been noted}} in winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, from Boston Harbor, Massachusetts. Inflammatory lesions include cholangiitis, pericholangiitis, pericholangial fibrosis, hepatitis, and pancreatitis. Necrotic lesions consist essentially of focal coagulative necrosis and a distinctive vacuolated cell lesion of the hepatic parenchyma. The most conspicuous and numerous proliferative lesion is macrophage aggregate hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Preneoplastic lesions include principally basophilic foci of cellular alteration and hepatocellular adenoma. Carcinomas consist of several morphologic varieties: hepatocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and anaplastic adenocarcinoma. The pathogenesis of the lesions observed is discussed with respect to anthropogenically introduced chemical contaminants and the resistant hepatocyte model of hepatocarcinogenesis. This study, and others of <b>bottom-living</b> food <b>fish</b> with enzootic neoplastic disease, warrants further evaluation, {{particularly with respect to}} possible bioaccumulation of chemical contaminants in edible tissues...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{freshwater}} sculpins (genus Cottus) are small, <b>bottom-living</b> <b>fishes</b> {{widely distributed}} in North America and Europe. The taxonomy of European species has remained unresolved {{for a long}} time due to the overlap of morphological characters. Sound production has already been documented in some cottid representatives, with sounds being involved in courtship and agonistic interactions. Although the movements associated with sound production have been observed, the underlying mechanism remains incomplete. Here, we focus on two closely related species from Belgium: C. rhenanus and C. perifretum. This study aims 1) to record and to compare acoustic communication in both species, 2) to give further insight into the sound-producing mechanism and 3) to look for new morphological traits allowing species differentiation. Results: Both Cottus species produce multiple-pulsed agonistic sounds using a similar acoustic pattern: the first interpulse duration is always longer, making the first pulse unit distinct from the others. Recording sound production and hearing abilities showed a clear relationship between the sound spectra and auditory thresholds in both species: the peak frequencies of calls are around 150 Hz, which corresponds to their best hearing sensitivity. However, it appears that these fishes could not hear acoustic signals produced by conspecifics in their noisy habitat considering their hearing threshold expressed as sound pressure (~ 125 dB re 1 ␣Pa). High-speed video recordings highlighted that each sound is produced during a complete back and forth movement of the pectoral girdle. Conclusions: Both Cottus species use an acoustic pattern that remained conserved during species diversification. Surprisingly, calls do not seem to have a communicative function. On the other hand, fish could detect substrate vibrations resulting from movements carried out during sound production. Similarities in temporal and spectral characteristics also suggest that both species share a common sound-producing mechanism, likely based on pectoral girdle vibrations. From a morphological point of view, only the shape of the spinelike scales covering the body allows species differentiation. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|Bottom {{trawling}} is trawling (towing a trawl, {{which is}} a fishing net) along the sea floor. It is {{also referred to as}} [...] "dragging". The scientific community divides bottom trawling into benthic trawling and demersal trawling. Benthic trawling is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean and demersal trawling is towing a net just above the benthic zone.

40|$|The shorthorn sculpin Myoxoaephalus scorpius is not fished commercially in Newfoundland. Its biology, based {{primarily}} on year-round monthly samples from Bay Bulls and on direct observations in its natural environment while scuba diving, is presented. [...] The nomenclature of the species is reviewed briefly. [...] The length frequencies of males were normally distributed but those of the females were more evenly distributed throughout their range of lengths. Females attain larger sizes and, on the average, are larger than the males. [...] Various length-weight relationships, including whole, gutted and fillet weights, for each sex are given as well as seasonal changes in the coefficient of condition. [...] Average length-at-age data were fitted to the von Bertalanffy equation. Below age 4 the growth rates {{of males and females}} were little different but above age 4 the females grew much faster than the males. The difference between average length-at-age for males and females became progressively larger with age. Analysis of the age composition of the populations sampled showed definite year-class dominance. [...] Males were found to mature at a younger age and at a smaller size than females. In any age group where there were mature and immature specimens the mature ones, on the average, were larger. [...] Ripening ovaries were found to contain 3 generations of ova which were evenly distributed throughout the ovary. Oogenesis takes about 2 ½ years. Spawning starts in late November to early December and lasts for about one month. The eggs are deposited in clumps in crevices usually in about 20 - 35 ft of water and after spawning the females move away from the spawning area into deeper water. The mature males remain behind and guard the eggs until they hatch. At temperatures near 0. 0 °C embryonic development takes over 3 months. Hatching starts about mid-March, reaches a peak towards the end of March and is completed early in April. Newly- hatched larvae were observed to occupy all layers of the water column where the water was about 25 - 30 ft deep but were concentrated about 2 ft off the bottom. They were observed to swim upwards and to sink downwards in the water column. Mature females produced between 4000 and 61, 000 eggs depending on size. [...] Shorthorn sculpins are omnivorous carnivores and scavengers. The bulk of their food is benthic invertebrates, mainly crabs, but small, <b>bottom-living</b> <b>fishes</b> form a fairly large part of their diet. Feeding activity changes throughout the year and is considerably reduced before and during the spawning period. They have a rich parasitic fauna, including a variety of trematodes a and nematodes internally and amphipods and hirudineans externally...|$|R
50|$|On land, pelagic {{cormorants}} {{are rather}} clumsy and walk with the high-stepped waddling gait typical for all Sulae except darters; after landing they often scratch the ground, as is typical for cormorants. When they feel threatened, they will dart their bills at the intruder, and {{shake their heads}} and make a gargling noise. This bird forages by swimming to locate prey, then diving and going after it underwater, propelled by its feet and steering with the wings. It can dive as deep as 100 ft to feed {{on or near the}} seafloor. Typical hunting grounds are sheltered inlets and bays; especially outside the breeding season they can also be seen fishing out at sea. They prefer to hunt in the vicinity of kelp beds or among rocks. Typical prey are smallish, <b>bottom-living</b> non-schooling <b>fishes,</b> such as Ammodytes sand eels, sculpins (Cottidae), gunnels (Pholidae) and Sebastes (rockfish). Apart from fish, small crustaceans - in particular shrimp - are also often eaten. It has been observed to join mixed-species feeding flocks going after schools of young Pacific herrings (Clupea pallasii). Like all cormorants, due to their vestigial uropygial gland their plumage is not waterproof. Thus, the birds return to a safe place after foraging to preen and dry their feathers, typically adopting a spread-winged posture.The pelagic cormorant breeds on rocky shores and islands. They do not form large colonies, but smaller groups may nest together. In some cases these birds alternate between two or three nesting sites in a region from one year to another. The nest is built at the cliff face, usually on ledges, less often in crevices or caves. The nest is built from stringy plants, such as grasses or seaweed, and held together by the birds' own guano. Once the birds have found a nest site they like, they tend to remain faithful to {{it for the rest of}} their lives. The nest is repaired and improved in each season if need be; it can thus grow up to 5 ft (1.5 m) deep.|$|R
50|$|Gurnards {{are very}} {{distinctive}} <b>bottom-living</b> <b>fish</b> with large heads and eyes. The head {{is protected by}} large bony plates and strong spines. The lower three rays of the pectoral fins are separate, finger-like processes that contain sensory organs.

It {{is one of the}} smallest of the European gurnards reaching a maximum length of 40 cm. The coloration is bright red with pinkish-silver mottling on the sides and head. The protective bony plates on the head which are characteristic of all gurnards are very conspicuous in this species. Along the lateral line there is a row of large, plate-like scales. The divided dorsal fin has nine spines and seventeen to eighteen soft rays while the anal fin has no spines and sixteen to eighteen soft rays.|$|E
40|$|The 2004 {{breeding}} season {{was the least}} successful ever recorded for most seabirds on the Isle of May. Adult return rates of all the species followed were normal or above average, indicating that survival was generally high. European shags, black-legged kittiwakes and common guillemots all bred late. Most species appeared to find conditions difficult, with colony attendance being low. Problems were exacerbated by strong winds and prolonged heavy rain in late June, {{which resulted in the}} deaths of large numbers of young of shags and puffins.

40|$|Studies of the fine-scale use of {{foraging}} habitat {{are essential}} for understanding the role of seabirds in marine ecosystems. However, until recently, relationships between foraging and habitat usage were only possible at a coarse scale. We used miniaturized bird-borne digital still-picture camera loggers to obtain high-quality images of the foraging habitat used by 9 European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis. Underwater images revealed that shags are almost exclusively benthic feeders, but used 2 very distinct foraging habitats: sandy areas and rocky areas with brittlestars, soft corals and kelp. We {{found no evidence that}} individuals specialize on a particular habitat. Birds were recorded in rocky and sandy areas {{over the course of a}} day and in some cases within a trip. Foraging behaviour differed markedly between habitats. In rocky areas birds foraged solitarily, over a wide range of depths (10 to 40 m) and travelled along the bottom while searching for <b>bottom-living</b> <b>fish</b> such as butterfish Pholis gunnellus. In contrast, shags using sandy habitat frequently fed with conspecifics, foraged mainly at 2 depths (24 or 32 m) and spent the bottom phase of the dive probing into the sand with their bill, presumably to catch lesser sandeels Ammodytes marinus, the major prey item in the diet. This study highlights the flexible foraging strategy of European shags and illustrates how image and dive data can be combined to improve our understanding of the factors influencing the foraging success of benthic feeders...|$|E
