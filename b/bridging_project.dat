50|$|The {{tertiary}} sources report the following: One of Mandrocles' successors, not named by Herodotus (7.34-36), was Harpalos of Tenedos who, succeeding where Egyptian and Phoenician engineers had failed, built the {{bridge over the}} Hellespont (Hofstetter 1978, no. 130; on the bridge, see Hammond and Roseman 1996). It is important for a right estimate of Ionian science to remember the high development of engineering in these days. Mandrokles of Samos built the bridge over the Bosporos for King Dareios (Herod. iv. 88), and Harpalos of Tenedos bridged the Hellespont for Xerxes when the Egyptians and Phoenicians had failed in the attempt (Diels, Laterculi Alexandrini, Abh. der Berl.

40|$|N o one {{who reads}} Placenames Australia needs convincing that toponyms are important, that they form an {{integral}} part of our history and culture, and that they are worth studying and preserving. Learning the Bardi language has brought home to me just how vital a knowledge of placenames is to being fluent in a language and to being able to understand something about that culture. I have been working with the last speakers of Bardi since 1999, when I set to work on a book of traditional stories as a <b>bridging</b> <b>project</b> between honours at ANU and starting my PhD. As soon as I began transcribing stories I was grateful that Gedda Aklif had included a list of placenames in the Bardi Dictionary. In the European lexicographic tradition toponyms are not usually included in a dictionary; placenames, along with other proper names, are consigned to specialist dictionaries. But learners of Bardi using the dictionary need to know that Iwany is a placename just as they need to know that aamba means ‘man’ or iinalang means ‘island’. Placenames appear in many Bardi sentences, and are often used instead of directiona...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of public policies and schemes aim to foster integration dynamics by supporting immigrant development practices. The intent {{of this paper is}} to assess the effectiveness of this correlation through a comparison between two major immigrant Berber groups in France: the Algerian Kabyles and the Moroccan Chleuhs. While Moroccan organisations have become active development actors for the benefit of their origin area, Algerian ones, though sharing similar immigration and post-immigration trajectories, do not display the same level of commitment. Contrary to their Moroccan counterparts, Algerians, for historical and geopolitical reasons, have never been able to build an organisational level between hometown networks and funding bodies, i. e. a group of NGOs <b>bridging</b> <b>project</b> holders and host country organisations. This paper concludes with an attempt to distinguish the effects of development practices according to the definition given to integration. There is little evidence that development practices improve individual integration, not even the image of immigration in the host country. However, the study shows that commitment to development projects produces and is produc ed by functional integration of immigrant groups. The projects build up a cohesive interdependence between migrant actors and beyond, between immigrant and host country organisation...|$|E
40|$|The Grahamstown Tertiary Education <b>Bridging</b> <b>Project</b> (GRATEP) {{was formed}} in 1991 {{by a group of}} post-matriculants from Grahamstown who had not been {{accepted}} into any tertiary institution for 1991. The overall aim of GRATEP was to prepare these students for tertiary education. The Academic Skills Programme at Rhodes University offered a programme in English Language Development. The present study aimed to research the design, implementation and evaluation of the GRATEP English Language Development programme which was implemented from May through to October 1991. A multimethod approach has been used to assess the progress made by the students in terms of developing communicative competence in English and to evaluate the course itself. The data included writing samples, questionnaires, exercises in hierarchical organization, a clozetest, comments made by the students and the participant observers. The programme appeared to have been most effective in terms of building confidence, developing academic skills and encouraging the students to take greater responsibility for their own learning. Statistical comparisons of the first and final writing samples revealed no overall significant improvement in communicative competence in English. However, comparisons of the scores in the categories and sub-categories of communicative competence revealed that students had improved in their ability to structure and organize their writing. The research raised questions about the design, implementation and assessment of non-formal language courses of this kind and made suggestions for improvement and further research. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{project was}} {{originally}} conceived for 3 {{years with a}} budget of approximately US$ 1. 9 million. In order to expedite its early implementation, it was approved for an initial period of 18 months, with drastically reduced budget of US$ 946 916, although its objectives, outputs and activities were retained in full. While approving the first phase, {{an extension of the}} project was, however, clearly visualized. In order to ensure uninterrupted continuation of project activities after the end of Phase 1, FAO provided a <b>bridging</b> <b>project</b> of us$ 340 000 under its TCP programme. Because of drastic cut in its resources, UNDP was not able to finance Phase 2 of the Project; it, however, provided an additional sum of US$ 120 000 to continue project activities for a further period of 3 months, in order to locate an alternative funding source. Efforts are still being pursued to identify a possible donor. Despite the constraint of resources, the project succeeded in its objective of laying the foundations of an Early Warning and Food Information System, which is so vital for the food security of Sudan. The project's major achievements include its successful training programme, contributing to building up the technical capabilities of the local staff, introduction of crop forecasting with such innovative activities as the establishment of a Field Monitoring System, a Crop Weather and Watch Group and the launching of an entirely new Ten-Day Weather and crop Bulletin for dissemination of early warning information. The terminal report highlights the need for strengthening the government services and infrastructure for generating early warning and food information data for a comprehensive coverage of {{the country as a whole}} and for providing basic data/information up to the lowest level of geographical disaggregation. It is recommended that further training be provided to local staff to create adequate manpower to operate the Early Warning and Food Information System on a self- sustaining basis. Continuation of the project for at least 3 years is absolutely necessary to fully achieve this objective...|$|E
40|$|Following a {{dramatic}} expansion of tsetse {{distribution in the}} potentially agriculturally productive southwestern area of Ethiopia, assistance was sought to start a national tsetse control programme. The development and small-scale testing of suitably modified odour-baited and insecticide-treated attractive devices (tsetse targets) were successfully achieved through two TCP projects, TCP/ETH/ 4523 and TCP/ETH/ 6765. By the end of these operations in April 1988, tsetse {{had been reduced to}} below detectable levels and, concurrently, livestock and crop production significantly increased over a test area of approximately 50 km 2 in the Upper Didessa River ValleyThe purpose of this project was to consolidate the gains achieved and to assist in extending tsetse eradication over an adjacent 500 km 2 area where trypanosomiasis continued to constrain agricultural production severely. These activities have achieved considerable success. Some 400 kmý of previously infested area has been cleared of tsetse, and affected farmers have markedly increased production. The control technique has been proved to be effective for large-scale sustainable use under local conditions, and is suitable for implementation by farmers on a self-help basis. Subsidiary trials have also indicated that the strategic low-density placement of targets along the altitude limits of tsetse distribution can result in a market reduction in the seasonal incidence of trypanosomiasis in highland cattleFormal and in-service training provided by the project and supplemented by a one-month, in-country, practically-orientated course through the regional project RAF/ 85 / 015, Lusaka, has significantly strengthened the capability of national personnel in this specialized disciplineIn the light of the success achieved, it was recommended that vector control be expanded into a sustainable programme over the southwestern region in order to consolidate gains and increase further the area available for production. Such operations should be supported by further field trials to adapt the control techniques for use against other tsetse species. Consideration also should be given to the use of insecticide-treated livestock as an alternative to artificial baits. Both formal and in-service training should be continuedAny future operations should aim initially at continuing eradication along the Didessa River Valley and tributaries which, because of altitude separation, are largely protected from lateral re-invasion. A two-year <b>bridging</b> <b>project</b> to support this was presented to the World Bank for funding within the Fourth Livestock Development Programme. This recommendation was made to ensure the integration of tsetse control with the national development and settlement policy, which recognizes the production potential of this area as confirmed by land-use studie...|$|E
