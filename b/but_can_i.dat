6000|$|Chad {{could always}} {{take in the}} easiest {{way in the world}} any ingenious suggestion. [...] "I see. <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> help it? I'm too decent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, there's {{something}} wonderfully sound about Mills!" [...] he said. [...] "It's a ghoulish {{thing to}} ask for {{in the middle of}} the day, isn't it, Philippa, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> have some champagne?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Father,” said Rollo, “I can work. You thought I {{could not}} work, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> {{am going to}} work to-day while you are gone.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No treason; {{nothing of}} that kind. But I {{should like to}} make Buckingham Palace second-rate; and I'm not quite sure <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> dare say you don't quite {{understand}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|She looked pleased. [...] "How {{well you}} understand," [...] she wrote. [...] "Yes, I cannot speak or sing as other people <b>can,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make my violin say things for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> allow that?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "It would mean--for we {{must face}} it, Katharine--that we let our {{engagement}} {{stand for the}} time nominally; in fact, of course, your freedom would be absolute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you really}} mean it? <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>I?</b> Is it fair? How sweet of you! Come here {{and let me}} hug you all!" [...] cried Jill, in a rapture at the surprise, and the pretty {{way in which it}} was done.|$|E
6000|$|It was a downcast {{little man}} that {{followed}} him. [...] "Of course {{he is very}} clever, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> trust him in such a state?" [...] he asked himself. And when they were once more in a hansom, he took heart of grace.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O Mr. Audley! how <b>can</b> <b>I?</b> I know {{it must be}} very wrong, <b>but</b> how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> not care?' And verily {{the nervous}} {{sensitive}} girl was quivering with suspense.|$|R
6000|$|She {{threw down}} the saw. [...] "Well, that beats me; I can't saw, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> cook. <b>I</b> made them biscuits." [...] She {{challenged}} his opinion, as he well knew.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, I shall {{enjoy it}} very much if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get away. <b>I</b> have my doubts whether I shall be able to; <b>but</b> if <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> <b>I</b> will {{certainly}} avail myself of your offer.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mont. How {{gratitude}} and love divide my breast! Both ways alike my soul is robbed of rest. But--let him die--Can I his sentence give? Ungrateful, must he die, by whom I live? <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> then Almeria's tears deny? Should any live whom she commands to die? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do not understand," [...] she repeated. [...] "Ah, no! <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> {{make you}} understand? Will {{you listen to}} me for once as a human being? Will you {{remember}} that you are a man, and I a woman pleading for a little mercy--a little kindness?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're {{glad to see}} us. We mean {{something}} here. These people are satisfied. Why can't I be? <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> sit back all my life and be satisfied with 'Hey, folks'? They want shouts on Main Street, and I want violins in a paneled room. Why----?" ...|$|E
6000|$|LEXY. I know. (Rising wittily to the occasion.) <b>But</b> how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> {{watch and}} pray when I am asleep? Isn't that so, Miss Prossy? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you {{can help}} me, Richard. It was of this matter I wished to speak this evening. <b>But</b> now--how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> speak of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So am I," [...] said Valentin to Newman. [...] "The marquis and I are charmed. I can't marry, myself, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{understand}} it. <b>I</b> can't {{stand on}} my head, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> applaud a clever acrobat. My dear sister, I bless your union." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thus far, no doubt, her {{strange and}} {{touching}} {{position has been}} plainly revealed to you. <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> feel quite so sure that you understand how seriously she has {{been affected by the}} anxiety, disappointment, and suspense which have combined together to torture her at this critical interval in her life? ...|$|E
60|$|But I am case-hardened. And I am sick of shops. True, we {{have not}} been in a town for three months. <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> care for the innumerable fantasias in the drapery line? Every wretched bit of would-be-extra chic is called a fantasia. The word goes lugubriously to my bowels.|$|E
6000|$|Lewis. Alas! {{while each}} day blackens with fresh clouds, Complaints of ague, fever, {{crumbling}} huts, Of land thrown {{out to the}} forest, game and keepers, Bailiffs and barons, plundering all alike; Need, greed, stupidity: To clear such ruin Would task the rich prime of some noble hero-- <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> nothing do? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} to detain you at all, signore. <b>But</b> what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> do? The {{commissary}} is unhappily absent. He may be here soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|GLORIA (reassured by his withdrawal, and {{a little}} remorseful). I am sorry. I {{do not mean to}} be unsympathetic, Mr. Valentine; <b>but</b> what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> say? ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{jumped up}} at that. [...] "I {{have thought of}} it," [...] she {{answered}} [...] "I am always thinking about it, <b>but</b> how <b>can</b> <b>I,</b> oh, now <b>can</b> <b>I?</b> It would not be respectable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he {{said with}} a faint, remote playfulness in his tone which had not been heard in it lately, and which seemed to catch her ear pleasantly. [...] "I am grieved to say that I don't know. <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> do anything? What would you wish me to do? Pray command me." ...|$|E
6000|$|If you {{are good}} as you are fair, indeed, [...] Keep to {{yourself}} those sweet eyes, I implore! [...] A little flame burns under either lid [...] That might in old age kindle youth once more: [...] I am like a hermit in his cavern hid, [...] <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> look on you and not adore? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good! {{there is}} no good. <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> help it, if I love him? Can I make myself not love him by just wishing it? Oh, I would do it if I could. But now you will {{understand}} why I shake my head when you talk of my coming to your house. Your ways and my ways must be different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Nancy. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see that. <b>But</b> where <b>can</b> <b>I</b> go? Even {{that place}} in the woods, they're {{watching}} that, {{and they would have}} me if I tried to go back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The very same, Davie," [...] said he. [...] "One {{would think}} a colonel would have {{something}} better to attend to. <b>But</b> what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> say that make songs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Ant. Why, truly, {{conscience}} {{is something}} to blame for interposing in our matters: <b>but</b> how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> help it, if I have a scruple to betray my master? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Lovel, you are hurt--and, believe me, I sympathize in {{the pain}} which I inflict; <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>I,</b> in justice to myself, in {{fairness}} to you, do otherwise? Without my father's consent, I never will entertain the addresses of any one, and how totally impossible {{it is that he}} should countenance the partiality with which you honour me, you are yourself fully aware; and, indeed"-- ...|$|E
60|$|My chief occupation, {{to begin}} with the youngest, consists, in acting as steward on Owen's property. The routine of my duties has never lost its sober {{attraction}} to my tastes, for it has always employed me in watching the best interests of my brother, and of my son also, who is one day to be his heir. <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> expect our fair guest to sympathize with such family concerns as these? Clearly not.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} that," [...] replied Henry Warden; [...] "thou mayest indeed cast {{me into a}} dungeon, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> foretell that my Master hath not task-work for me to perform even in that dreary mansion? The chains of saints have, ere now, been the means of {{breaking}} the bonds of Satan. In a prison, holy Paul found the jailor whom he brought to believe the word of salvation, he and all his house." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Juhn, [...] "Kim Ki-duk {{always says}} that I must transcend him. It's an {{extremely}} burdensome task, <b>but</b> what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> do? All <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{do is just}} to strive forward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You promise, king Ithobal, that if I yield myself {{you will}} set the prince Aziel free; <b>but</b> how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> believe you who twice have tried to murder him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll try to be, if you like. I know I {{ought to}} take the lawyer; <b>but</b> what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> do if the major's {{daughter}} keeps running in my head?" ...|$|R
