5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties {{are more important than}} imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims about it <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could {{have anything to say about}} practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have to be careful not to get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, {{a set of}} {{pictures}} showing Padukone kissing the actor Siddharth Mallya at an Indian Premier League match were made available on the web. This led to wide speculation in the media {{about the nature of}} their relationship, which Padukone declined to talk about publicly. The following year there were reports about a break-up, to which she said: [...] "Just <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> seen together, it doesn't mean that we are not friends anymore." [...] She has since denied reports of her link-up to Ranveer Singh, stating that she is [...] "not in a frame of mind to be in a relationship." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} story, then titled [...] "The Shroud," [...] {{was written}} by Joseph Stefano, who had previously worked on The Outer Limits. Hannah Louise Shearer was given the task of re-writing the original take. The first draft had Yar's death occur earlier in the episode with {{the main focus of}} the episode being the Armus creature rather than her death. It was the show's creator, Gene Roddenberry who argued in favor of her sudden demise as he felt it was suitable for a security officer. Roddenberry also argued against killing Armus in retaliation. Shearer later described the decision, saying [...] "Gene felt we couldn't kill the creature, because it is not up to us as human beings to make a moral judgement on any creature that we encounter, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> God".|$|E
2500|$|The first voices seeking {{compromise}} {{have started}} {{to be heard in}} Skopje. The president of the republic, Branko Crvenkovski, announced: [...] "If during the ongoing talks we can reach a rational compromise, which from the one side will defend our ethnic identity, and from the other will enable us to receive the NATO invitation, {{while at the same time}} canceling our further EU accession obstacles, then I think that this is something that must be supported, and I personally side with the supporters. Some accuse me that with my stance I am undermining the negotiating position of the Republic of Macedonia, yet I do not agree, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> in the beginning, but in the final phase of the negotiations. The one who will tell me that the price is high, is obliged to address the public opinion and announce an alternative scenario on how Macedonia will develop in the next ten to fifteen years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Blake's ironic {{treatment}} of empirical doctrines and natural religion, {{a key element}} introduced in Series b is desire; [...] "the rational mind, merely a mechanical manipulation or [...] "ratio" [...] of sense experience, [...] "shall be" [...] transformed as spiritual enlightenment advances and we discover more than [...] "organic perceptions" [...] allow. If {{it were not for}} desires reaching beyond the sensate, Man would be trapped in a self-imposed empiricist prison. For Blake, expanding the prison or accumulating more will not bring any respite, as only the Infinite will satisfy Man. If we could not attain the infinite, we would be in eternal despair, but <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> Blake reasons that we thus must be able to attain the Infinite, and as such, Man becomes Infinite himself; [...] "Locke's principle of a reciprocal and mutually validating relationship among the mind, the sense organs, and their objects has been converted into a similarly structured reciprocity among infinite desire, its infinite object, and its infinite desirer." ...|$|E

60|$|I, who had plumed myself {{upon the}} fact that Simon Kenton {{was willing to take}} me with him as a scout, felt that almost {{anything}} was better than returning, and yet I knew it was my duty to push on up the stream to warn those who <b>were</b> descending, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> yet positive that the scout had taken away the boat.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the church}} began to collide and meld with {{cultures}} outside of Utah and the United States, the church began to jettison {{some of the}} parochialisms and prejudices that had become part of Latter-day Saint culture, but were not essential to Mormonism. In 1971, LDS General Authority and scholar Bruce R. McConkie drew parallels between the LDS Church and the New Testament church, who had difficulty embracing the Gentiles within Christianity, and encouraged members {{not to be so}} indoctrinated with social customs that they fail to engage other cultures in Mormonism. Other peoples, he stated, [...] "have a different background than we have, which is of no moment to the Lord.... It is no different to have different social customs than it is to have different languages.... And the Lord knows all languages". In 1987, Boyd K. Packer, another Latter-day Saint Apostle, stated, [...] "We can't move [...] with a 1947 Utah Church! Could it be that we are not prepared to take the gospel <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> prepared to take (and they are not prepared to receive) all of the things we have wrapped up with it as extra baggage?" [...] During and after the Civil Rights Movement, the church faced a critical point in its history, where its previous attitudes toward other cultures and people of color, which had once been shared by much of the white American mainstream, began to appear racist and neocolonial. The church came under intense fire for its stances on blacks and Native Americans issues.|$|E

30|$|Images of {{specimens}} {{were taken}} by an Olympus digital camera STYLUS TG- 4 Tough (Tokyo, Japan) using its microscope mode. Areas of white spots and black disks of eyespots in C. tasajera were measured using ImageJ v. 1.48 image analysis software (Schneider et al. 2012). <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> allowed to measure absolute values, which potentially damages the specimens, relative values within a single image were used for comparison in this study.|$|R
30|$|This {{study is}} limited by a small sample size, in {{particular}} of the organ measurements, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> able to analyze organs from all recipients due to logistic reasons.

Given that the standard of appropriate transfusion requires more than 75  % posttransfusion survival, the use of human RBCs in rodent recipients <b>are</b> <b>not</b> appropriate to study the efficacy of RBC transfusion.|$|R

5000|$|Behaviorist {{learning}} theory {{is based on}} studies of animal behaviors where animals such as pigeons learned to do tasks when they received rewards and extinguished (stopped) behaviors that <b>were</b> <b>not</b> rewarded or <b>were</b> punished. Most of us can point to things we continue to do <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> rewarded for doing them. Rewards can <b>be</b> the pay <b>we</b> get for jobs we do, desired recognition like [...] "A" [...] grades for doing excellent school work, and praise from our friends when they like what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing. Likewise, <b>we</b> can point to things <b>we</b> stopped doing <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> rewarded or <b>were</b> punished for them. Behaviorist {{learning theory}} tends to look at extrinsic rewards like money, grades, and gold stars rather than intrinsic rewards like feeling good about successfully accomplishing a difficult task.|$|R

So there was a place in Chicago that was chosen and/or the Roseland in New York. And <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> one of their big shoots, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> put on hold, so we had to wait until these other acts either agreed to play Chicago or New York, and then the truck with all of the {{equipment}} be there shooting 3-D material for PBS.

5000|$|In the 2000s many LGBT {{individuals}} {{began moving}} to Westbury and several began referring {{to it as}} [...] "Little Montrose". By 2009 some were also moving to Riverside Terrace. By 2011 many LGBT people moved to the Houston Heights and to suburbs in Greater Houston, and according to Hill, possibly less than 8% of Montrose's population was LGBT. Decentralization of Houston's LGBT population with the increasing LGBT acceptance in the city caused business at gay bars in Montrose to decline. Hill stated that [...] "Gay bars used to <b>be</b> places where <b>we</b> {{had to go to}} get refuge <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> welcome anywhere else. Well, guess what?
