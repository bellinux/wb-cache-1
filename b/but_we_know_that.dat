25|$|This {{frontier}} {{remained for}} about 100 years, {{and no doubt}} in that long period much was done to it to which precise dates are difficult to fix. It cannot even be absolutely certain when the frontier laid out by Pius was equipped with the manpitts and other special fortifications. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{the pressure of the}} barbarians began to be felt seriously in the later part of the 2nd century, and after long struggles the whole or almost the whole district east of the Rhine and north of the Danube was lost, seemingly all within one short period, about 250.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} some things {{for which it is}} not enough to state a single cause, but several, of which one, however, is the case. Just as if you were to see the lifeless corpse of a man lying far away, it would be fitting to list all the causes of death in order to make sure that the single cause of this death may be stated. For you would not be able to {{establish}} conclusively that he died by the sword or of cold or of illness or perhaps by poison, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there is something of this kind that happened to him.|$|E
25|$|The same {{argument}} for unification {{could be made}} for Latin and Cyrillic -- the American English encoding system known as ASCII never encoded the Cyrillic А (U+0410) differently from the Latin A (U+0041) -- <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> ASCII was never intended to display both Latin and Cyrillic in the same document. Similarly, Korean encoding standards never had the aim of displaying Korean and Japanese and Chinese and Cyrillic and Ethiopian all within a single document. Almost all of the variants that the PRC developed or standardized got unique codepoints owing simply to the fortune of the Simplified Chinese transition carrying through into the computing age. This privilege however, seems to apply inconsistently. While most simplifications performed in Japan and mainland China with codepoints in national standards, including characters simplified differently in each country, did make it into Unicode as unique codepoints.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed at the White Lodge, in Oxted, Surrey. The episode's burglars are {{played by the}} writers; the pair were quoted as saying [...] "we didn't want to {{dominate}} , so we sometimes play fairly minor characters. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> say, if we were writing something about two burglars, we'd be the burglars." [...] Pemberton suggested that a partial influence for the episode {{may have been the}} children's television series Brum. He said that he and Shearsmith had [...] "always wanted to be a couple of robbers in that, so that might be where the idea came from". Both writers agreed that their roles were [...] "great to perform", and Pemberton described the resulting episode by saying that it [...] "worked out better than [...] could have dreamed".|$|E

2500|$|Dr Bilal Philips on {{marriage}} with girls before puberty: [...] "The prophet Muhammad practically outlined the rules regarding marriage prior to puberty. With his practice, he clarified what is permissible, {{and that is}} why we shouldn't have any issues about an older man marrying a younger woman, which is looked down upon by this society today, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Prophet Mohammed practised it, it wasn’t abuse or exploitation, it was marriage." ...|$|E

[...] Many stanzas appeared to have been written between November 22 and 25, 1826. On March 23, 1828, the first separate edition of chapter 6 was published.|$|E
2500|$|... "At {{the present}} day (ca. 1872) the most usual {{argument}} {{for the existence of}} an intelligent God is drawn from the deep inward conviction and feelings which are experienced by most persons. But it cannot be doubted that Hindoos, Mahomadans and others might argue in the same manner and with equal force in favor of the existence of one God, or of many Gods, or as with the Buddhists of no God...This argument would be a valid one if all men of all races had the same inward conviction of the existence of one God: <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> this is very far from being the case. Therefore I cannot see that such inward convictions and feelings are of any weight as evidence of what really exists." [...] (p.91) ...|$|E

Presently the Doctor recommenced lazily, as if no interruption had occurred.|$|R
2500|$|Probably in July or August of 251, the Roman army {{engaged the}} Scythians under Cniva near Abritus. The {{strengths}} of the bellingerent forces are unknown, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Cniva divided his forces into three units, {{with one of these}} parts concealed behind a swamp. It seems that Cniva was a skilled tactician and that he was very familiar with the surrounding terrain. Jordanes and Aurelius Victor claim that Herennius Etruscus was killed by an arrow during a skirmish before the outset of the battle and that his father addressed his soldiers as if the loss of his son did not matter. He allegedly said, [...] "Let no one mourn. The death of one soldier is not a great loss to the Republic". However, other sources state that Herennius died with his father.|$|E
2500|$|Hephaestion {{was given}} a {{magnificent}} funeral. Its cost is variously given in the sources as 10,000 talents or 12,000 talents. It is difficult to give a modern equivalent for such a huge amount <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> in Hephaestion’s time, the daily wage of a skilled worker was two or three drachmas. In western Europe, 2008, that would be between £50 and £100, so the lowest possible value for 1 drachma in modern terms is £25. We know there were 6,000 drachmas in a talent, so even at the most conservative estimate, Hephaestion’s funeral would have cost £1,500,000,000. Alexander himself drove the funeral carriage {{part of the way}} back to Babylon with some of the driving entrusted to Hephaestion's friend Perdiccas. At Babylon funeral games were held in Hephaestion's honour. The contests ranged from literature to athletics and 3,000 competitors took part, the festival eclipsing anything that had gone before both in cost and in numbers taking part. Plutarch says that Alexander planned to spend ten thousand talents on the funeral and the tomb. He employed Stasicrates, [...] "...as this artist was famous for his innovations, which combined an exceptional degree of magnificence, audacity and ostentation...", to design the pyre for Hephaestion.|$|E
