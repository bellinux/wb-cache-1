The early Middle Ages was a period of climate deterioration, with a drop in temperature and an increase in rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. This was reversed in the period c. 1150 to 1300, with warm dry summers and less severe winters allowing cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and making land more productive. In the late Middle Ages, average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands.|$|E

These methods were focused on <b>blanket</b> bog <b>peat</b> but are suitable for other environments. In addition to group specific 16 S rRNA DNA sequences, specific functional gene probes based on methane coenzyme reductase sequences for methanogens and methane monooxygenase sequences for methanotrophs, were developed.

There was also significantly greater horizontal K parallel to the pipe's orientation compared with horizontal K perpendicular to the pipe. Determinations of the triaxial anisotropy of K, undertaken {{for the first time in}} peat soils, revealed substantial directional variations in K.

40|$|Stream- and soilwater at the 18. 7 ha {{pristine}} Ingabekken catchment, on gneiss bedrock at Høylandet, {{have been}} studied for three years, including intensive episode studies in spring and autumn. The site mainly consists of blanket bogs which are typical for these marine west coast climates. Water drains through the <b>blanket</b> <b>peats</b> by means of two major flowpaths. Each flowpath contributes to the stream with a distinct chemical fingerprint rendered by the soil/soil water interactions along the flowpath, i. e. they may be regarded as end-members. The soil water from the upper peat layers is the end-member representative of stormflow discharge whereas baseflow originates mainly from seepage of the other end-member, which is the mineral soil water from beneath the peat. The pHBaCl 2 of the soils that control the runoff chemistry during highflow conditions was as low as 2. 6, allowing for a substantial pH drop in streamwater {{in the case of}} a seasalt episode. pH in the stream varied from more than 7 at baseflow to 5 or slightly below at stormflow. The lowest pH (4. 8) was observed during early snowmelt due to release of meltwater highly enriched in seasalts. The fraction of exchangeable aluminum (AlS) was much higher in the surface layers of the lower reaches of the catchment than close to the water divide. This suggests a transport of Al, much like podzolisation, though downslope by a lateral flowpath.

The sampling area was largely covered by <b>blanket</b> bog <b>peat</b> together with small areas of red-brown limestone and peaty gley.

Purified DNA {{was subjected to}} PCR amplification with primers IAf and 1100 Ar, which specifically amplify 1. 1 kb of the archaeal 16 S rRNA gene, and ME 1 and ME 2, which were designed to amplify a 0. 75 -kb region of the alpha-subunit gene for methyl coenzyme M reductase (MCR). Amplification with both primer pairs was obtained only with DNA extracted from the two deepest sections of the <b>blanket</b> bog <b>peat</b> core. This {{is consistent with the}} notion that anaerobiosis is required for activity and survival of the methanogen population. PCR products from both amplifications were cloned, and the resulting transformants were screened with specific oligonucleotide probes internal to the MCR or archaeal 16 S rRNA PCR product. Plasmid DNA was extracted from probe-positive clones of both types and the insert was sequenced. The DNA sequences of 8 MCR clones were identical, as were those of 16 of the 17 16 S rRNA clones. One clone showed marked variation from the remainder in specific regions of the sequence. From a comparison of these two different 16 S rRNA sequences, an oligonucleotide was synthesized that was 100 % homologous to a sequence region of the first 16 clones but had six mismatches with the variant. This probe was used to screen primary populations of PCR clones, and all of those that were probe negative were checked for the {{presence of}} inserts, which were then sequenced. By using this strategy, further novel methanogen 16 S rRNA variants were identified and analyzed.

40|$|The Quaternary geology of Chatham Island {{has been}} {{investigated}} using several different techniques, including: tephrochronology, mineralogy, palynology and stratigraphy; {{in an attempt to}} draw together a Quaternary history for the Island. The Quaternary record of Chatham Island comprises mainly deposits from terrestrial environments, predominantly thick <b>blanket</b> <b>peats</b> and aeolian sand, all of which range from latest Castlecliffian to Haweran/Recent in age. Quaternary deposits that demonstratably predate this age range (i. e. > Oxygen Isotope Stage 12) have not been recognised anywhere on the Island. Their absence is, at this stage, attributed to a major marine transgression across much of the northern and central portions of the Island during Oxygen Isotope Stage 11. Two rhyolitic tephra produced during two of the largest eruptions from the Taupo Volcanic Zone are present on Chatham Island. The 27. 1 ka Kawakawa Tephra is well preserved across most of the Island, occurring within most pre-Holocene sequences. The 345 ka Rangitawa Tephra, not previously recognised on Chatham Island, is found in a few scattered coastal locations where older, late Castlecliffian sediments are preserved. In the absence of any other forms of radiometric age control these two tephras have provided the principal means for time control within and between stratigraphic sequences on the Island. Palynology has been used predominantly to determine climatic conditions at the time of sediment accumulation. Palynological investigations of seven sections of peat deposits have also demonstrated that cyclic changes in vegetation patterns have occurred throughout the Quaternary on Chatham Island. However these changes have not been as significant as those that occurred on mainland New Zealand over the Quaternary. It is concluded that this indicates climatic deterioration during glacials may not have been as pronounced on Chatham Island as on the mainland. Marine terraces created during former high sea level stands are preserved in several areas on Chatham Island. Quaternary terrace surfaces ranging in age from Last Interglacial (OIS 5 e) to OIS 11 occur at heights of 3 - 5 m, 9 – 10 m, 16 m, 20 m and 30 - 40 m above sea level. An exhumed surface of Late Pliocene age occurs at 7 – 14 m a. s. l [...] Terrace ages have been determined using cover-bed stratigraphy, and in particular {{the presence or absence of}} tephra marker beds. Height-age relationships of marine terraces have been used to develop preliminary rates of tectonic uplift on Chatham Island. The resulting values range between 0. 01 – 0. 13 mm/yr and are very low compared with more tectonically active areas of mainland New Zealand. However, there is considerable variation in these rates across Chatham Island, indicating that the tectonic history of the Island over the Quaternary may be complex. This thesis has also demonstrated that considerably more work is required to fully understand the Quaternary history of Chatham Island. In particular, better numerical age control on key deposits; more detailed, high-resolution pollen records from key locations; and obtaining stratigraphic records from a greater range of locations. This is particularly so for the southern uplands where older records are virtually inaccessible due to a thick <b>blanketing</b> of post-glacial <b>peat</b> deposits...|$|R
