5|$|Although {{at least}} some of the poems {{attributed}} to Narihira in imperial anthologies are dubious, there is a large enough <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work contained in the relatively reliable Kokinshū for scholars to discuss Narihira's poetic style. Narihira made use of engo (related words) and kakekotoba (pivot words).|$|E
5|$|The {{sadness of}} the harsh {{conditions}} {{of those days}} is captured by the simple epitaph on the gravestone of James Myers who is buried in the Methodist Cemetery at Yeadon behind the Town Hall. James was a married man just 22 years old who 'died by an accident in the Bramhope Tunnel on the 14th day of April, 1848'. Next to him lies the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 3 years old daughter who died two weeks later of some unspecified illness.|$|E
5|$|A more {{elaborate}} style known as decorated Gothic, applying ornamentation to vaults and pillars, particularly using curved motifs, {{began to be}} adopted {{in the thirteenth century}} and was characteristic of Scottish church building in the fourteenth century. It was used at Dunblane Cathedral, built in the thirteenth century, particularly to decorate the nave and East end. At Fortrose in the Highlands the elaborate decoration of this style is still visible in the south aisle. One of the finest examples is Sweetheart Abbey near Dumfries, a Cistercian monastery, named after the burial of John de Balliol's heart alongside the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife. The period of the Wars of Independence (1296–1357) saw a large number of ecclesiastical buildings ruined, including Melrose and Jedburgh Abbeys. Church building was largely confined to the parish churches in the relatively secure areas like Fife, as at St. Monans, originally a church of the Dominican friars.|$|E

5|$|Faramir first {{encountered}} the hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in Ithilien and recognized {{them to be}} the Halflings mentioned in his dreams. Faramir questioned Frodo of his quest, and Frodo revealed that he, along with eight other companions including Boromir, had set out from Rivendell. During the interrogation, Faramir asked often about Boromir, since he knew, although Frodo at that point did not, that Boromir was already dead. One night, while on guard, Faramir waded down to the Anduin river after seeing a boat there. It contained the dead <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother, {{who had been killed}} by Orcs after Frodo left the group.|$|E
5|$|John and Kanyenke {{then take}} their mercenaries {{in pursuit of}} Warwick's fleeing army, and ally with the French in the Seven Years' War against Warwick. When Colonel George Washington tells them that Warwick is a renegade and has been hunted by the British as well, John agrees to track him down for the British. John leads his mercenaries and Washington's forces and destroys Warwick's base in the Great Lakes region. The {{presence}} of the Circle of Ossus' Boneguard prove to John {{the existence of the}} Circle and that Warwick is the current Circle's leader. In the ruins of the Circle's base John finds the decapitated <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> uncle Stuart. John then demands that Nonahkee be kept at home while they pursue Warwick, who has again escaped and fled to the Rocky Mountains. Kanyenke agrees and reveals that he knows about John's relationship with Nonahkee. He tells him that he would not have chosen John as her husband, but he accepts it because he knows that she decides who she loves.|$|E

5|$|On 16 March, five {{companies}} from the Camel Corps and mounted infantry scouts, {{supported by a}} 12-pounder artillery battery and a Maxim machine gun battery, crossed the Darfur frontier and four days later occupied Um Shanga. Their only opposition was from a small observation post which was forced to withdraw. Unexpectedly, upon arrival the Anglo-Egyptian force found the water supply at Um Shanga scarce. With the main <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> force expected to arrive that evening, having only two days supply of water with them, Kelly considered withdrawing back to Sudan. Instead, he divided his force, forming a fast moving column, consisting of thirty mounted infantry scouts, 240 men from the Camel Corps, two artillery pieces and eight Maxims, which left for Jebel el Hella at dawn on 22 March.|$|E
5|$|The Marines {{withdrew from}} their {{positions}} {{to the interior}} of Noddle's Island, and Stark's men left Crooked Creek to join the main <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forces on Hog Island. Diana and the other vessels continued northeast up Chelsea Creek in pursuit. By sunset, hundreds of cattle, sheep, and horses had been driven from Hog Island to the mainland. Also around sunset, Diana turned about {{in an attempt to}} avoid being trapped in the shallows of the creek. However, Lieutenant Graves realized he would require assistance, and raised a signal. Vice-Admiral Graves ordered barges manned by marines into the creek to tow Diana out, along with the sloop Britannia, tender of HMS Somerset (under the command of another of Graves nephews, Lieutenant John Graves) to assist and provide additional firepower.|$|E
5|$|Through a {{sharp and}} skilful tack, HMS Bellerophon, {{one of the}} slowest ships in the British van, succeeded in {{bringing}} the Révolutionnaire to steady action at 18:00. The ships exchanged fire for twenty minutes, the weaker Bellerophon taking severe damage to her rigging, and falling back {{to be replaced by}} HMS Marlborough under Captain George Cranfield Berkeley. Marlborough was joined by HMS Russell and HMS Thunderer, and between them they shot away much of the Révolutionnaire's rigging, so that by 19:30 she was unmanageable. HMS Leviathan also joined the action, firing at an unidentified ship ahead of Révolutionnaire. Concerned about Pasley's squadron becoming cut off from the main <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fleet, Howe recalled them to the British line at 20:00. All complied except the newly arrived HMS Audacious under Captain William Parker. Audacious had engaged Révolutionnaire so closely that she could not safely withdraw, and although her gunnery eventually dismasted her huge opponent, Audacious took severe damage.|$|E

5|$|After {{the birth}} of their son, Johnny's wife Sarah falls into a coma. Johnny soon discovers her talisman, which she had {{previously}} used to make a deal with a demon {{to save the life of}} her sister Rachel, unbeknownst to Johnny. In order to save Sarah, Johnny also makes a deal with the demon, and is transported back to 1995, where he possesses the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> younger self. He meets a younger Sarah, who invites him to a party. As they travel to the party, Johnny informs Sarah of the situation, but she dismisses it as a pick-up attempt. When they arrive, Johnny sees Rachel with the talisman and tells her to dispose of it; without responding, she ends the party. After she leaves, Rachel is involved in a car accident, and is transported to the hospital. Sarah, who now believes Johnny's story, goes to make a deal with the demon in order to save Rachel. However, upon discovering that the demon demands the sacrifice of Johnny and Sarah's child, Sarah destroys the talisman, and Rachel dies. These events alter those of the present day: Sarah never fell into a coma and instead lives normally with Johnny and their son.|$|E
