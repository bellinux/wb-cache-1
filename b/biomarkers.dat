5|$|Since {{these first}} {{landmark}} GWA studies, {{there have been}} two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011, the largest sample sizes were in the range of 200,000 individuals. The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller odds ratios and lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of more narrowly defined phenotypes, such as blood lipids, proinsulin or similar <b>biomarkers.</b> These are called intermediate phenotypes, and their analyses may be of value to functional research into <b>biomarkers.</b> A variation of GWAS uses participants that are first-degree relatives of people with a disease. This type of study has been named genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX).|$|E
25|$|Guidelines {{outlining}} {{requirements for}} inclusion of soluble <b>biomarkers</b> in osteoarthritis clinical trials {{were published in}} 2015, but as yet, there are no validated <b>biomarkers</b> for osteoarthritis. A 2015 systematic review of <b>biomarkers</b> for osteoarthritis looking for molecules {{that could be used}} for risk assessments found 37 different biochemical markers of bone and cartilage turnover in 25 publications. The strongest evidence was for urinary C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type II (uCTX-II) as a prognostic marker for knee osteoarthritis progression and serum cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP) levels as a prognostic marker for incidence of both knee and hip osteoarthritis. A review of <b>biomarkers</b> in hip osteoarthritis also found associations with uCTXII.|$|E

40|$|What makes a {{high-quality}} <b>biomarker</b> experiment The success of personalised medicine {{hinges on the}} answer to this question. In this paper, I argue that judgment about the quality of <b>biomarker</b> experiments is mediated by the problem of theoretical underdetermination.

Drawing on a case-study in <b>biomarker</b> diagnostic development from neurooncology, I argue that this problem of underdetermination can be overcome with greater coordination across the <b>biomarker</b> research trajectory. I then sketch an account for how coordination across a research trajectory can be evaluated.

Effectiveness {{can be defined as}} an individual's potential to benefit from using the <b>biomarker.</b> This benefit includes the prevention of undesirable clinical outcomes and improvement in an individual's quality of life. Assessment of a <b>biomarker’s</b> effectiveness should include two sequential criteria. First, the <b>biomarker</b> should add prognostic value in relation to basic clinical and laboratory data. Second, the information provided by the <b>biomarker</b> should promote changes in medical conduct in a way that ultimately benefits the patient.

40|$|In this paper, we detail an {{approach}} to a very specific task of information extraction namely, extracting <b>biomarker</b> information in biomedical literature. Starting with the abstract of a given publication, we first identify the evaluative sentence(s) among other sentences by recognizing words and phrases in the text belonging to semantic categories of interest to bio-medical entities (i. e., semantic category recognition). For the entities like, protein, gene and disease, we determine whether the statement refers to <b>biomarker</b> relationship (i. e., assertion classification). Finally, we identify the <b>biomarker</b> relationship among the bio-medical entities (i. e., semantic relationship classification). The system, <b>Biomarker</b> Information Extraction Tool (BIET) implements Machine Learning-based <b>biomarker</b> extraction using support vector machines (SVM). The system is trained and tested on a corpus of oncology related PubMed/MEDLINE literatures hand-annotated with <b>biomarker</b> information.
