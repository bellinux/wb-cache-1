[...] Storm <b>Bolters</b> may jam under sustained firing, rendering the weapon useless {{for a few seconds}} until the malfunction is cleared. [...] Although the action unfolds in real-time, the player can pause the game by clicking the [...] "Freeze" [...] button and entering [...] "Freeze Time". [...] While in this mode, every unit stops its motion while a timer runs down; the player can freely issue and modify orders to the Marines. [...] Once the timer is depleted or the Freeze button is clicked again, every unit resumes its movement. [...] The timer for Freeze Time slowly replenishes, as long as the game stays in real-time.|$|E
500|$|Charles Dick, then Hanna's {{aide and}} later his {{successor}} as senator, recounted, [...] "The opposition developed {{immediately after the}} election. [...] I might say the plotting, {{so far as the}} <b>bolters</b> were concerned, began before the election... The fifteen majority melted away." [...] According to Horner, [...] "as men elected to the Ohio legislature who were pledged to support Hanna continued to turn up opposing him... the chances of Hanna retaining his seat began to look rather grim". [...] Kurtz disavowed the Toledo convention's endorsement of Hanna, describing the gathering as controlled by the senator's paid agents. He stated his case against Hanna: [...] "The returns of the recent election show that he is not wanted by the party. [...] The days of Mr. Hanna's bossism are over. [...] The people here are against him, and that settles it." ...|$|E

60|$|January 13, 1862.--Leased a {{prominent}} residence (the former incumbent being absent in arms against his country) for {{the term of}} one year, and wrote at once for Mrs. Brigadier-General Doke and the vital issues--excepting Jabez Leonidas. In the camp of treason opposite here there {{are supposed to be}} three thousand misguided men laying the ax {{at the root of the}} tree of liberty. They have a clear majority, many of our men having returned without leave to their constituents. We could probably not poll more than two thousand votes.

6000|$|The Nebraska {{men were}} very {{confident}} {{of the election}} of Matteson, though denying {{that he was a}} candidate, and we very much believing also that they would elect him. But they wanted first to make a show of good faith to Shields by voting for him a few times, and our secret Matteson men also wanted to make a show of good faith by voting with us a few times. So we led off. On the seventh ballot, I think, the signal was given to the Nebraska men to turn to Matteson, which they acted on to a man, with one exception. [...] . Next ballot the remaining Nebraska man and one pretended Anti went over to him, giving him 46. The next still another, giving him 47, wanting only three of an election. In the meantime our friends, with a view of detaining our expected <b>bolters,</b> had been turning from me to Trumbull till he had risen to 35 and I had been reduced to 15. These would never desert me except by my direction; but I became satisfied that if we could prevent Matteson's election one or two ballots more, we could not possibly do so a single ballot after my friends should begin to return to me from Trumbull. So I determined to strike at once, and accordingly advised my remaining friends to go for him, which they did and elected him on the tenth ballot.|$|E

50|$|Keston Mill has a three-storey body on a {{single-storey}} roundhouse. The roundhouse enclosed the trestle and {{the date}} 1716 is carved on the main post. It had four double Patent sails carried on a cast-iron windshaft. The mill is winded by a tailpole. The wooden brake wheel drives a cast-iron wallower, which drives a cast-iron great spur wheel with wooden cogs. This drives two pairs of underdrift millstones in the breast of the mill. The mill also has a flour dresser (<b>bolter).</b> The <b>bolter</b> in Keston mill {{has been used as}} the model for a reconstructed <b>bolter</b> in Lowfield Heath Windmill, Charlwood, Surrey.|$|R
5000|$|The British-developed angled {{flight deck}} {{solved the problem}} of {{aircraft}} that failed to engage an arrestor wire, and created the routine option for aircraft to [...] "bolter". By angling the landing area off the ship's axis, thus [...] "removing" [...] obstructions forward of the landing area, aircraft that failed to arrest - that <b>bolter</b> - simply accelerate down the landing area and become airborne again. <b>Bolter</b> aircraft then climb back to landing pattern altitude and sequence in with other landing aircraft to re-attempt the landing.
