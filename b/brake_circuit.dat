5|$|The Leslie is {{specifically}} designed, via {{reproduction of the}} Doppler effect, to alter or modify sound. As the sound source is rotated around a specific pivot point, it produces tremolo (the modulation of amplitude) and a variation in pitch. This produces a sequence of frequency modulated sidebands. To stop a Leslie's rotor, a special <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> {{was added to the}} Leslie motor controls, that incorporated an electronic relay by producing a half-wave of direct current.|$|E
50|$|The {{air brakes}} {{are driven by}} an engine powered {{compressor}} which also feeds the servo for the hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>circuit.</b> The compressor system also includes a filter, a 40-litre vessel with a drainage valve, its own anti-freeze system {{as well as a}} valve and a hose to be used for inflating the tyres.|$|E
50|$|The Meillerwagen’s {{pneumatic}} brakes drew {{air pressure}} from the towing vehicle, and were operated by the tractor driver {{as an extension of}} his vehicle’s <b>brake</b> <b>circuit.</b> A control valve handle on the Meillerwagen regulated the braking force it drew from the tractor, depending on whether the Meillerwagen was laden with a rocket or unladen.|$|E
50|$|A {{brake booster}} {{is used on}} {{virtually}} all vehicles which use hydraulic brakes for their primary <b>braking</b> <b>circuit.</b> Vacuum servos are not used on vehicles which use cables, rods (or other mechanical linkages), or pressurized air systems for their primary <b>brake</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Full triple circuit air [...] "S" [...] {{cam drum}} brakes acting on all wheels drums via slack adjuster, all brake {{cylinders}} were remotely vented. First <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> acts on front wheels, the second on rear wheels {{and the third}} controls trailer service brakes. Unique design feature was remotely mounted brake valve which was operated via hydraulic master and slave cylinder principle on the Hauler 6x6 or via mechanical linkage on 8x8 models.|$|E
50|$|The system {{employs a}} travel sensor and a {{pressure}} sensor at the pedal {{to measure the}} speed and force of the driver's command. The control unit processes this information and generates the control signals for the wheel pressure modulators. Normally, the master brake cylinder is detached from the <b>brake</b> <b>circuit.</b> A pedal travel simulator creates normal pedal feedback. If ESP intervenes, the high-pressure reservoir supplies the required brake pressure quickly and precisely to selected wheels, without any driver involvement.|$|E
5000|$|Air line {{couplings}} {{are easier}} to attach and detach than hydraulic lines eliminating the risk of air getting into hydraulic fluid {{since there is no}} hydraulic fluid. Air <b>brake</b> <b>circuits</b> on trailers can be easily attached and removed by operators with appropriate training.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This Recommended Practice {{provides}} a common design {{basis for the}} control and configuration of blended brake systems. This recommended practice {{does not address the}} design and functionality of dynamic <b>braking</b> <b>circuits</b> as such, nor the protective features required by the dynamic braking function...|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} 15 inch wheels as against the 16 inch size found on {{previous}} Bristols, and the disc braking system {{dating back to}} the 406 was revised {{for the first time since}} then, with a greatly updated system of <b>braking</b> <b>circuits</b> being introduced.|$|R
50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service brake {{circuits}}, the parking <b>brake</b> <b>circuit,</b> and the trailer <b>brake</b> <b>circuit.</b> The dual service brake circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer service brake hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|E
5000|$|Interference {{is known}} as 'pulsating brakes' which may occur when braking while also having the turn {{indicator}} flashing. There are different ways to minimize this problem, and it ranges from using a special pulse preventer to having a separate electric brake trailer connector with a <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> completely separated {{from the rest of}} the trailer wiring. Be aware that if you do a completely separate wiring the brake ground must be separated from the lighting ground. That includes the breakaway protection circuits and battery. (Think of what Kirchhoff's circuit laws says).|$|E
5000|$|A {{reservoir}} above each {{master cylinder}} supplies the master cylinder with enough brake fluid to avoid air {{from entering the}} master cylinder (even the typical clutch uses brake fluid, {{but it may also}} be referred to as [...] "clutch fluid" [...] in a clutch applr). Each piston in a master cylinder operates a <b>brake</b> <b>circuit,</b> and for modern light trucks and passenger cars, usually a <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> leads to a brake caliper or shoe on only two of the vehicle's wheels, and the other <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> provides brake-pressure to slow down and stop the other two wheels. This is done in a diagonally split hydraulic system. If there is a hydraulic failure in the brake lines served by the master cylinder's secondary piston both pistons will move forward when the brakes are applied, but there is nothing to resist piston travel except the secondary piston spring. This lets the primary piston build up only a small amount of pressure until the secondary piston bottoms in the cylinder bore. Then the primary piston will build enough hydraulic pressure to operate the brakes served by this half of the system. In case of a hydraulic failure in the brake system served by the primary piston, the primary piston will move forward when the brakes are applied but will not build up hydraulic pressure. In this case very little force is transferred to the secondary piston through the primary piston spring until the piston extension screw comes in contact with the secondary piston. Then, pushrod force is transmitted directly to the secondary piston and enough pressure is built up to operate its brakes. Usually the 2 systems are split into left front and right rear comprising one system and right front and left rear comprising the other system. For safety, this is done so that usually only two wheels lose their braking ability {{at the same time and}} that both sides of the car have at least one braking system working and both ends of the car have at least one system working. With only 1 system working there is longer stopping distances and repairs should be done before driving again.|$|E
50|$|An {{advantage}} of a negative scrub radius is that the geometry naturally compensates for split µ (mu) braking, or failure {{in one of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>circuits.</b> It also provides center point steering {{in the event of a}} tire deflation, which provides greater stability and steering control in this emergency.|$|R
50|$|Also {{inherited}} from the previous model was the combination of disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear, but now with twin <b>braking</b> <b>circuits</b> as an additional safety feature, and servo-assistance. The 26M received enlarged front brake discs to complement its power-assisted steering, twin halogen headlights, and twin exhaust pipes.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic {{pressure}} switches have various uses in automobiles, for example, to warn if the engine´s oil pressure falls below a safe level, or to control automatic transmission torque converter lock-up. Prior to the 1960s, a pressure switch {{was used in}} the hydraulic <b>braking</b> <b>circuit</b> to control power to the brake lights; more recent automobiles use a switch directly activated by the brake pedal.|$|R
50|$|Valve and Pump SystemsThe {{main parts}} which {{are part of}} the {{pressure}} modulation system are solenoid inlet and outlet valves, a pump, motor and accumulators/reservoirs. The number of the valves differs from model to model due to additional functionalities and the number of brake channels. Based on the input of the ECU, coils operate the in- and outlet valves. During pressure release the brake fluid is stored in accumulators. In this open system approach the fluid is then brought back in the <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> via a pump operated by a motor which is felt through pulsation on the brake lever.|$|E
50|$|The S4-E {{incorporated}} the technically advanced {{features of the}} S4 DA such as an engine with twin overhead camshaft, hemispherical piston heads with the centrally positioned spark plugs. The chassis featured rack and pinion steering, with independent suspension at the front. However, the front suspension was now refined through the addition of longitudinal torsion bars, an approach probably copied from the Citroën Traction that had appeared the year before. Commentators noted that the new engine and suspension enhancements {{gave rise to a}} combination of performance and road-holding that was among the best in class for the time. Another novelty for the S4-E was a hydraulically controlled <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> in place of the then conventional mechanical linkage.|$|E
5000|$|The six {{cylinder}} engines were {{fitted with}} a new Carter carburetor. A vacuum operated “Fuel Pacer” was offered as an option, the device using a flashing light to assist the driver in avoiding fuel wastage. This light was initially on the right-hand guard, but was later fitted to the instrument panel. Additional safety features included a pressure proportioning valve in the rear <b>brake</b> <b>circuit,</b> power-boosted brakes and hazard warning lights. Indicator, headlight dipping, headlight flashing and windscreen wiper controls were now housed in a steering column stalk. This was the first multi-purpose stalk control to be fitted {{by any of the}} “big three" [...] manufacturers, the other two being Ford Australia and General Motors-Holden's.|$|E
50|$|To {{minimize}} interference between vehicle {{lighting and}} <b>brakes</b> the <b>circuits</b> shall be as separated as possible.|$|R
50|$|Also {{inherited}} from the previous model was the combination of disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. September 1967 saw the introduction of twin <b>braking</b> <b>circuits</b> as an additional safety feature, and in February 1968 servo-assistance for the braking system was introduced as an option on most models and included in the price for the more expensive versions of the car.|$|R
50|$|Triumph {{had been}} moving {{progressively}} upmarket during the 1930s, and the 1938 Dolomites were very well equipped, with winding {{windows in the}} doors, automatic chassis lubrication, a leather-bound steering wheel adjustable for rake and reach, dual hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>circuits,</b> twin trumpet horns, and spot lamps included in the price. There was even a tray of fitted tools slotted beneath the driver's seat cushion, and for an extra 18 guineas buyers could specify a radio.|$|R
50|$|The air {{compressor}} {{is driven by}} the engine either by crankshaft pulley via a belt or directly from the engine timing gears. It is lubricated and cooled by the engine lubrication and cooling systems. Compressed air is first routed through a cooling coil and into an air dryer which removes moisture and oil impurities and also may include a pressure regulator, safety valve and smaller purge reservoir. As an alternative to the air dryer, the supply system can be equipped with an anti-freeze device and oil separator. The compressed air is then stored in a reservoir (also called a wet tank) from which it is then distributed via a four way protection valve into the front and rear <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> air reservoir, a parking brake reservoir and an auxiliary air supply distribution point. The system also includes various check, pressure limiting, drain and safety valves.|$|E
50|$|This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, {{operated}} by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever {{behind the steering wheel}} to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch, engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the camshaft by a belt, the position of the butterfly valve in the carburettor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the <b>brake</b> <b>circuit.</b> When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to standstill.|$|E
5000|$|For the 1987 model year, the 944S [...] "Super" [...] was introduced. The 944S {{featured}} a high performance naturally aspirated, dual-overhead-cam 16-valve [...] {{version of the}} 2.5 L engine (M44/40) featuring a self-adjusting timing belt tensioner. This marked the first use of four-valve-per-cylinder heads and DOHC in the 944 series, derived from the 928 S4 featuring a redesigned camshaft drive, a magnesium intake tract/passages, magnesium valve cover, larger capacity oil sump, and revised exhaust system. The alternator capacity was 115 amps. The wheel bearings were also strengthened and the brake servo action was made more powerful. Floating 944 calipers were standard, but the rear wheel <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> pressure regulator from the 944 turbo was used. Small '16 Ventiler' script badges were added on the sides {{in front of the}} body protection mouldings. Performance was quoted as 0 - 100 km/h in 6.5 seconds (Best) and a 232 km/h top speed due to a 2857 lb weight. It also {{featured a}}n improved programmed Bosch Digital Motronic 2 Computer/DME with dual knock sensors for improved fuel performance for the higher 10.9:1 compression ratio cylinder head. Like the 944 Turbo, the 944S received progressive springs for greater handling, Larger front and rear anti-roll bars, revised transmission and gearing to better suit the 2.5 L DOHC higher 6800 rpm rev limit. Dual safety air bags, limited-slip differential, and ABS braking system were optional on the 944S.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, BMW {{introduced}} an electronic/hydraulic ABS for motorcycles, {{ten years after}} Daimler Benz and Bosch released the first four-wheel vehicle ABS for series production. Motorcycles of BMW K100 series were optionally equipped with the ABS, which added 11 kg to the bike. It was developed together with FAG Kugelfischer and regulated the pressure in the <b>braking</b> <b>circuits</b> via a plunger piston. Japanese manufacturers followed with an ABS option by 1992 on the Honda ST1100 and the Yamaha FJ1200.|$|R
50|$|In September 1967 servo-assistance for {{the brakes}} became an option, {{the brakes on}} all but the basic model now being {{controlled}} using twin <b>braking</b> <b>circuits,</b> and by (in Germany) the final months of 1968 the range had settled down to three models, with the entry level Audi 60 powered by a 55 PS motor, the less basic Audi 75 producing 75 PS and the Audi Super 90 with 90 PS, able to challenge the performance image {{of some of the}} smaller BMWs.|$|R
50|$|The Appia Berlina used unibody construction. Front {{suspension}} was of Lancia's sliding pillar type, with hydraulic dampers.At {{the rear}} {{there was a}} solid axle on leaf springs, with hydraulic dampers; the axle had an aluminium differential housing and a stamped steel structure.All Appias were equipped with hydraulic brakes, and drums an all four wheels. Series three cars gained a dual <b>braking</b> <b>circuit</b> and twin leading shoe, finned aluminium front drums with cast iron wear rings; the rears remained solid cast iron.When leaving the factory they would originally fit Pirelli Cinturato 155HR15 tyres (CA67).|$|R
50|$|Another {{excellent}} and long-term {{example of this}} principle being put into practice is the braking system: whilst the actual brake mechanisms are critical, they are not particularly prone to sudden (rather than progressive) failure, and are in any case necessarily duplicated to allow even and balanced application of brake force to all wheels. It would also be prohibitively costly to further double-up the main components and they would add considerable weight. However, the similarly critical systems for actuating the brakes under driver control are inherently less robust, generally using a cable (can rust, stretch, jam, snap) or hydraulic fluid (can leak, boil and develop bubbles, absorb water and thus lose effectiveness). Thus in most modern cars the footbrake hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> is diagonally divided to give two smaller points of failure, the loss of either only reducing brake power by 50% and not causing as much dangerous brakeforce imbalance as a straight front-back or left-right split, and should the hydraulic circuit fail completely (a relatively very rare occurrence), there is a failsafe {{in the form of}} the cable-actuated parking brake that operates the otherwise relatively weak rear brakes, but can still bring the vehicle to a safe halt in conjunction with transmission/engine braking so long as the demands on it are in line with normal traffic flow. The culmulatively unlikely combination of total footbrake failure with the need for harsh braking in an emergency will likely result in a collision, but still one at lower speed than would otherwise have been the case.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{electromechanical}} {{characteristics of}} a regenerative brake for electric vehicle are analyzed by numerical calculation means. For this purpose, the problem is formulated according {{to the idea that}} the electric vehicle is a electromechanical interaction system. Proposing a method of applying the repetition calculation method to this formulation, the concrete application technique is shown. Numerical analysis results show that for this <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> the deceleration of about 0. 2 G can be expected in a high-speed region, and the performance decreases in a low-speed region. Moreover, in case of the condition of using the machine brake together in a low-speed region, it is clarified that this <b>brake</b> <b>circuit</b> is a practicable one...|$|E

50|$|The Kadett B was {{the first}} Kadett to offer disc brakes on the front wheels. 238 mm {{diameter}} disc brakes at the front came included as standard fittings on all but the cheapest versions, complemented by 200 mm diameter drum brakes at the back. The brakes were controlled hydraulically. From February 1967 the single hydraulic <b>braking</b> <b>circuit</b> {{was replaced by a}} dual <b>circuit</b> <b>braking</b> system: this built in reserve of redundancy in the braking control system reflected a growing interest in primary and secondary safety which was becoming a feature of German auto-design in the 1960s. Whether as an option on the base model or as a standard feature across the rest of the range, where disc brakes were fitted Opel also included servo-assistance in the braking system from February 1967.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} cabin contains {{seating for}} driver and two passengers. An extended cabin with a bed was available as an option. The cabin includes upholstery and insulation. The heating system incorporates air nozzles to provide, in particular, windscreen demisting. Dashboard instruments include a speedometer and odometer {{along with an}} ammeter and gauges showing water temperature, oil pressure, fuel levels and, separately {{for each of the}} two <b>braking</b> <b>circuits,</b> air pressure. The braking system also has a separate alarm light triggered by low air pressure in the circuits or a too long stroke of the air brake actuators.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the regulations pertain to safety. Cars must have two steel roll hoops of designated thickness and alloy, regardless of {{the composition of the}} rest of the chassis. There must be an impact attenuator in the nose, and impact testing data on this attenuator must be submitted prior to competing. Cars must also have two hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>circuits,</b> full five-point racing harnesses, and must meet geometric templates for driver location in the cockpit for all drivers competing. Tilt-tests ensure that no fluids will spill from the car under heavy cornering, and there must be no line-of-sight between the driver and fuel, coolant, or oil lines.|$|R
