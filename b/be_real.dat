5|$|A {{vector space}} (also called a linear space) is a {{collection}} of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars. Scalars are often taken to <b>be</b> <b>real</b> numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms, listed below.|$|E

5|$|Late {{one night}} in 1997, Boston Herald {{reporter}} Tom Mashberg was driven to a warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn by William Youngworth {{to see what was}} purported to be The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. Youngworth was a career criminal and associate to New England art thief Myles Connor Jr. Mashberg had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the painting with a flashlight. He was given a vial of paint chips for authenticity. These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th-century origin—but not from the stolen painting. It was never concretely determined to <b>be</b> <b>real</b> or fake, and the FBI quit speaking to Youngworth after not making any progress. The painting has since disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner product}} between two state vectors {{is a complex}} number known as a {{probability}} amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical system, {{the probability that a}} system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate is given by the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator—which explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must <b>be</b> <b>real.</b> The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} three days, the group {{undertook}} a series of tasks by which they could earn the right to become housemates. The remaining non-housemates were instructed to change into a special uniform. Anyone not obeying would lose {{the opportunity to become}} a housemate. Lisa gained housemate status {{in the early hours of}} Day 2 when she answered a ringing phone in the living room. Given 15 minutes to select the fourth housemate, she chose Kris. Charlie and Saffia later became housemates after walking barefoot over broken sugar glass, believing it to <b>be</b> <b>real</b> glass, and Karly became the seventh housemate after being tricked into believing that she had a motorbike ridden over her stomach. Freddie and Sophie became housemates after changing their names, documented by deed poll to Halfwit and Dogface respectively. On Day 3 Cairon earned housemate status by dunking a biscuit in a cup of tea for 25.5 seconds without it disintegrating. Remaining non-housemates Angel, Beinazir, Marcus, Siavash, Sophia and Sree faced the public vote on Day 4 to determine which five would become housemates and which one would be evicted. With 6.8% of a vote to save, Beinazir became the first evictee without ever becoming a housemate.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{portrayed as}} an {{imaginary}} {{character in a}} schizophrenia storyline, Rae was later revealed to <b>be</b> <b>real</b> when she arrived to study in Hollyoaks. She was central to a controversial suicide storyline, and {{was part of a}} love triangle with Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), which left her pregnant by Ste. She miscarried during an argument with Brendan and subsequently feuded with him; Barlow praised her character for being {{one of the few who}} dared to oppose the Hollyoaks villain. Rae was originally characterised as a chav with a feisty persona, but underwent a transformation when she attempted to embrace domestic life with Ste. During series four of the post-watershed spin-off Hollyoaks Later, Rae was murdered by a serial killer, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle). The late broadcast slot allowed an explicit depiction of her death. Barlow hoped that Rae would be remembered for her strong-willed nature, and that her exit would be considered one of the best in the programme's history.|$|E
5|$|Following Voyager's {{encounters}} with Enceladus {{in the early}} 1980s, scientists postulated {{that it may be}} geologically active based on its young, reflective surface and location near the core of the Ering. Based on the connection between Enceladus and the Ering, scientists suspected that Enceladus was the source of material in the Ering, perhaps through venting of water vapor. Readings from Cassini's 2005 passage suggested that cryovolcanism, where water and other volatiles are the materials erupted instead of silicate rock, had been discovered on Enceladus. The first Cassini sighting of a plume of icy particles above Enceladus's south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images taken in January and February 2005, though the possibility of a camera artifact delayed an official announcement. Data from the magnetometer instrument during the February 17, 2005, encounter provided a hint that the feature might <b>be</b> <b>real</b> when it found evidence for a planetary atmosphere. The magnetometer observed an increase in the power of ion cyclotron waves near Enceladus. These waves are produced by the interaction of ionized particles and magnetic fields, and the waves' frequency can be used to identify their composition, in this case ionized water vapor. During the two following encounters, the magnetometer team determined that gases in Enceladus's atmosphere are concentrated over the south polar region, with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower. The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) confirmed this result by observing two stellar occultations during the February 17 and July 14 encounters. Unlike the magnetometer, UVIS failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it looked over the equatorial region, but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the south polar region during the July encounter.|$|E
