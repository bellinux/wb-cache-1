George's clothing, which had been torn when he was seized in the bluff, had further suffered during the deluge. He looked a weary, ragged outcast.|$|E

Four fingers on Mary's left hand, broken during a move, were restored in 1736 by Giuseppe Lirioni, and scholars are divided {{as to whether}} the restorer took liberties to make the gesture more 'rhetorical'. The most substantial damage occurred on May 21, 1972, (Pentecost Sunday) when a mentally disturbed geologist, the Hungarian-born Australian Laszlo Toth walked into the chapel and attacked the sculpture with a geologist's hammer while shouting [...] "I am Jesus Christ; I have risen from the dead!" [...] With fifteen blows he removed Mary's arm at the elbow, knocked off a chunk of her nose, and chipped one of her eyelids. Onlookers took many of the pieces of marble that flew off.

40|$|Abstract: Three {{dimensional}} {{seismic survey}} {{carried out in}} the western Nankai Accretionary Prism off Muroto succeeded in imaging of clear geologic structure and detailed distribution of BSR. Topography and geologic structure influence the distribution of BSR in the survey area. Especially, depths of BSRs obviously change along out-of-sequence thrusts. In large thrust zone, BSR in the hanging wall of a large thrust reaches down to the thrust, while the footwall does not have clear BSR. Heat flow values calculated from depth of BSR indicate that more intensive fluid convection occurs toward the toe of the Nankai prism. Heat flow increases seaward in each faults unit bounded by out-of-sequence thrusts, and the heat flow drops down at the out-of-sequence thrusts. The same seaward increase and the drop are duplicated at each fault <b>block</b> <b>cut</b> by minor scale thrust. These features give rise to more speculation related to an interaction between geologic structure, fluid migration, and development of BSR and gas hydrate deposits. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} observe {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) expression patterns of genes in whole animals, whole organs, or whole tissues, {{in situ hybridization}} (ISH) of many sections {{must be carried out}} and then used to construct a 3 D image. For this purpose, we have developed an automatic microtome to prepare tissue sections with an adhesive film. We used commercially available film suitable for sectioning and ISH. We constructed a microtome and, after adherence of the film to a paraffin-embedded tissue <b>block,</b> <b>cut</b> the block with a blade to prepare sections on film. Then, the sections-on-film were automatically set in a plastic frame that was the same size as a conventional glass slide. With this automatic microtome, tissue sections can be made for ISH or immunohistochemistry in addition to conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining without specific training. We demonstrate that we can construct 3 D images of gene expression patterns obtained by ISH on sections prepared with this automatic microtome. We have designated this method as ‘Film Tomography (FITO) ’. Key words: 3 D images, adhesive film, automatic microtome, film tomography, in situ hybridization...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the cutting efficiency of 2 new reciprocating instruments, Reciproc and WaveOne. Methods: Twenty-four new Reciproc R 25 and 24 new WaveOne Primary files were activated by using a torque-controlled motor (Silver Reciproc) and divided into 4 groups (n = 12) : group 1, Reciproc activated by Reciproc ALL program; group 2, Reciproc activated by WaveOne ALL program; group 3, WaveOne activated by Reciproc ALL program; and group 4, WaveOne activated by WaveOne ALL program. The device used for the cutting test consisted of a main frame to which a mobile plastic support for the handpiece is connected and a stainless steel block containing a Plexiglas block (inPlexiglass, Rome, Italy) against which the cutting efficiency of the instruments was tested. The length of the <b>block</b> <b>cut</b> in 1 minute was measured in a computerized program with a precision of 0. 1 mm. Means and standard deviations of each group were calculated, and data were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni test (P. 05).

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{introduce}} a new device specifically designed to evaluate the cutting efficiency of mechanically driven endodontic instruments. Material/Methods: Twenty new Reciproc R 25 (VDW, Munich, Germany) files were used to be investigated in the new device developed to test the cutting ability of endodontic instruments. The device consists of a main frame to which a mobile plastic support for the hand-piece is connected and a stainless-steel block containing a Plexiglas block against which the cutting efficiency of the instruments was tested. The length of the <b>block</b> <b>cut</b> in 1 minute was measured in a computerized program with a precision of 0. 1 mm. The instruments were activated by using a torque-controlled motor (Silver Reciproc; VDW, Munich, Germany) in a reciprocating movement by the "Reciproc ALL" program (Group 1) and in counter-clockwise rotation at 300 rpm (Group 2). Mean and standard deviations of each group were calculated and data were statistically analyzed with a one-way ANOVA test (P 0. 05). Conclusions: The cutting testing device evaluated in the present study was reliable and easy to use and may be effectively used to test cutting efficiency of both rotary and reciprocating mechanical endodontic instruments. © Med Sci Monit...|$|E
40|$|The {{initiation}} {{and growth}} of electrical trees under high electric stress have been studied in XLPE to explore {{the effects of the}} internal mechanical stress. Treeing tests were carried out under an applied voltage of 7 kVrms and both tree initiation and growth were monitored. The needle with a tip radius around 5 mm was inserted into a XLPE <b>block</b> (<b>cut</b> from a XLPE power cable) at elevated temperature. Two types of samples have been prepared, one with a significant internal mechanical stress around the tip of the needle and the other without. It was found that {{in the presence of the}} mechanical stress around the tip the tree initiation time is significantly shorter and growth rate is faster compared with those without. The combined effects of the internal mechanical stress and the frequency of the applied voltage on the structure of electrical tree during the growth stage have also been investigated. For example, in the presence of the internal mechanical stress, the results showed that the tree has a mixture of branch-like and bush-like structure at low frequency. In the absence of the mechanical stress, the results indicated that the tree at the early stage has many thicker branches at high frequency and thinner branches at low frequency...|$|E
