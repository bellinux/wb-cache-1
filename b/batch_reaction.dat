50|$|Geochemical models, on {{the other}} hand, have been {{developed}} to provide thermodynamic descriptions of multicomponent systems without regards to transport. Reaction path models were created, for instance, to describe the sequence of chemical reactions resulting from chemical weathering or hydrothermal alteration in batch systems, in terms of the overall reaction progress. By adopting the reference frame of a packet of fluid and treating reaction progress as travel time (or distance along a flowpath), however, a <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> path model could be thought of as describing advective transport through an aquifer.|$|E

Using the enzymatic ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone as a model, effects of organic solvents and reaction temperature on the monomer conversion and product molecular weight were systematically investigated. After the optimization of reaction conditions, products were obtained with  100 % monomer conversion and Mn values lower than 1010 g/mol.

50|$|Increased rate of {{reactions}} using microdroplets {{is seen in}} the aldol reaction of silyl enol ethers and aldehydes. Using a droplet-based microfluidic device, reaction times were shortened to twenty minutes versus the twenty-four hours required for a batch process. Other experimenters were able to show a high selectivity of cis-stilbene to the thermodynamically favored trans-stilbene compared to the <b>batch</b> <b>reaction,</b> showing the high degree of control afforded by microreactor droplets. This stereocontrol is beneficial to the pharmaceutical industry. For instance, L-Methotrexate, a drug used in chemotherapy, is more readily absorbed than the D isomer.|$|E
50|$|Instead {{of solving}} all the {{relevant}} equations together, the transport and chemical reaction equations can be solved separately. Operator splitting, as this technique is known, uses appropriate numerical techniques to solve the reaction and transport equations at each time step. Various methods exist, including the sequential non-iterative approach (SNIA), Strang splitting, and sequential iterative approach (SIA). Since the reaction and transport terms are handled separately, separate programs for <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> and transport can be linked together. Cross-linkable re-entrant software objects designed for this purpose readily enable construction of reactive transport models of any flow configuration.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the removal of dissolved arsenite (As(III)) using a 100 - mesh zero valent iron (Fe??) material with millimeter in <b>batch</b> <b>reactions.</b> Several experiments were performed {{using a variety of}} techniques for both liquid and solid phase analysis. The objective was to carry out a basic, a systematic investigation of the reaction of As(III) with a well-characterized Fe?? material with a low surface area compared with nanometer-scale materials. <b>Batch</b> <b>reactions</b> and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) revealed that the initial rate of As(III) uptake (removal) was a slow process compared with smaller Fe?? particle materials. Total As(III) removal reached a maximum at 14. 84 mg/g. Solid phase analysis of the products by X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed magnetite (Fe 3 0 4). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed needle-like surface structures due to magnetite. The removal of dissolved As(III) and the surface reactivity of Fe?? are closely dependent on the total As(III) concentration. Therefore a complete understanding of As(III) contaminant removal will require measurement and monitoring...|$|R

This showed that the nitrilase of N. globerula NHB- 2 was stable at 35 °C and could be recycled through suitable immobilization techniques. Theoretically {{it was possible to}} utilize the recovered nitrilase to produce 0.6 moles of INA (86 % of 0.7 moles). Thus, the total theoretical yield of INA through recycling the biocatalyst derived to be 1.3 moles (0.7 [*]+[*] 0.6 mole).|$|E

50|$|Another green {{approach}} is a modification to the Turkevich citrate reduction making use of flow chemistry, reported by Bayazit et al. Flow chemistry is an appealing replacement for many heated <b>batch</b> <b>reactions.</b> By exposing more surface area of {{the reaction to the}} heating element, flow reactors heat a reaction faster and more evenly than a batch reactor can, promoting rapid nucleation and smaller particle sizes with higher monodispersity.|$|R

30|$|Isonicotinic acid (INA) is an {{important}} pyridine derivative used {{in the manufacture of}} isoniazid (antituberculosatic drug) and other pharmaceutically important drugs. Nitrilase catalysed processes for the synthesis of pharmaceutically important acids from their corresponding nitriles are promising alternative over the cumbersome, hazardous, and energy demanding chemical processes. Nitrilase of Nocardia globerula NHB- 2 (NitNHB 2) is expressed in presence of isobutyronitrile in the growth medium (1.0 % glucose, 0.5 % peptone, 0.3 % beef extract, and 0.1 % yeast extract, pH 7.5). NitNHB 2 hydrolyses 4 -cyanopyridine (4 -CP) to INA without accumulation of isonicotinamide, which is common in the reaction catalysed via fungal nitrilases. The NitNHB 2 suffers from substrate inhibition effect and hydrolysing activity up to 250 mM 4 -CP was recorded. Complete conversion of 200 mM 4 -CP to INA was achieved in 40 min using resting cell concentration corresponding to 10 U mL- 1 nitrilase activity in the reaction. Substrate inhibition effect in the fed <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> (200 mM substrate feed/ 40 min) led to formation of only 729 mM INA. In a fed <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> (100 mM 4 -CP/ 20 min), substrate inhibition effect was encountered after 7 th feed and a total of 958 mM INA was produced in 400 min. The fed <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> scaled up to 1 L and 100 % hydrolysis of 700 mM of 4 -CP to INA at 35 °C achieved in 140 min. The rate of INA production was 21.1 g h- 1 mgDCW- 1. This is the fastest biotransformation process ever reported for INA production with time and space productivity of 36 g L- 1 h- 1 using a bacterial nitrilase.|$|E
40|$|The {{bench scale}} Novozym 435 ? catalysed {{esterification}} of 4 -methyloctanoic acid with ethanol was studied at 35 °C. Esterification in a batch reactor (molar ratio of 1 : 8 (acid:EtOH)) {{resulted in the}} isolation of the enantiomerically enriched product (eep= 81 percent and substrate (ees= 93 percent) In order to integrate reaction and separation, liquid-vapour equilibria calculations were performed showing that an excess of ethanol results in a very low ester fraction in the vapour phase. Since this is undesirable for an integrated process of reaction and product removal, a repeated <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> was performed using a molar ratio of 10 : 1 (acid:EtOH). After six cycles (45 percent conversion) the ee of 4 -methyloctanoic acid ethyl ester turned out to be 80 percent. For different E values the eep was calculated for batch and repeated batch reactions. It was shown that in all cases the eep was higher for the repeated <b>batch</b> <b>reaction.</b> However, the product is not enantiopure since the E value of the reaction is rather low at the low ethanol concentration used. An alternative approach would be the continuous separation of the product during the reaction. A mathematical model was developed to describe esterification in a packed bed reactor integrated with product separation. This model shows that integration of reaction and product removal in advance is not suitable either to obtain an enantiomerically pure product. Since the optimal reaction conditions (high ethanol concentration) and the optimal separation system (low ethanol concentration) do not match in this reaction, the preference is given to the <b>batch</b> <b>reaction</b> at high ethanol concentrations because in that case the highest enantioselectivity of the enzyme is obtained...|$|E

40|$|Glass batch melting {{has been}} studied by many {{researchers}} on various scales and under various conditions but no comprehensive understanding has been reached. In view of this situation, {{a major part of}} this work was devoted to the improvement of five new experimental methods suitable for the investigation of batch melting. These are: conductometry, thermal diffusivity, heating microsopy, batch free time (BFT) and weight loss measurement. Firstly, as for the development of conductometry, three meaningful ways to present <b>batch</b> <b>reactions</b> in terms of "DTA", "voltage drop", and "electrical conductivity" were concluded. It was also possible to determine the duration of stages characterized by foaming. Secondly, for thermal diffusivity, an optimized output signals at a frequency of 50 Hz with time interval of 150 s was applied. It showed good measurment results. As a conclusion, the grain-to-grain contact in model calculations should be taken into account by a dimensionless shape factor of 2. 5 to 3. 5. Local conductometry combined with temperature measurement allowed to measure simultaueously the electrical conductivity and the local temperature in a melting batch. The measurement of the local thermal diffusivity was performed by an evaluation of the runtime of a periodically generated heat pulse. Thirdly, for the heating microscope, a new way to present the effect of gas release from glass batches prior to refining was developed. It was found that minor batch additions additions have a large influence. Fourthly, the BFT results show that the reaction behavior of container flint and green glass batches was more sluggish than that of crystal glass batches. By observation through a silica tube furnace, the beginning of <b>batch</b> <b>reactions</b> with cullets at the surface deep into the glass melt were observed. After 2 minutes foam was formed and decreaed within 10 minutes. Finally, weight loss determination for samples up 200 g was developed. It was found that the mass loss of soda ash detected in a vertical tube furnace started at a lower temperature and was completed at a higher temperature than suggested by the results measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These new characterization methods not only open concepts for the presentation and interpretation of <b>batch</b> <b>reactions,</b> but also close the experimental gap between conventional lab scale characterization and the behavior actually observed in industrial production...|$|R
