40|$|TypescriptIncludes bibliographical referencesM. S. University of Missouri 1910 A {{great many}} {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} on with swine, which have determined the amount of feed necessary and the cost to produce a pound of gain during periods of fattening, with various kinds and combinations of foodstuffs; {{but there is a}} decided lack of knowledge regarding the cost of maintaining the <b>brood</b> <b>sow</b> throughout the year and the cost of producing the pig to weaning time. Such lack of data has helped to retard the placement of Agriculture upon a business basis. There have been no data available by which a charge could be made against the "feeder hog" at time of weaning. Such factors along with the difficulty of division of labor have prevented the farmer from applying business principals to his profession; and the lack of application of business principles to farming has resulted in depressing the net profits that might accrue from the profession. From November 18, 1908 to March 2, 1910 - a period of 469 days - the following experiment was conducted with the hope of furnishing to the feeder and others interested material from which the real cost of the pig at weaning time could be ascertained. The object was to collect such data as would warrant the debiting of the pig at weaning time with certain chargers. In order to do this it was necessary to determine the cost of maintenance of the <b>brood</b> <b>sow</b> throughout the year, including the cost of maintenance while farrow and suckling pigs.

40|$|Citation: Fields, James William. The <b>brood</b> <b>sow.</b> Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1903. Introduction: FEEDING. [...] The little sow {{should not}} be allowed to stop growing after weaning but to the contrary, should be made to grow as rapidly as {{possible}} all the time. She {{should not be}} kept fat but in good flesh, nor should she be fed concentrates but to the opposite she should have a bulky food which will keep her digestive tract distended making her capable of handling a great amount of food when she gets to be a year old. Clover or alfalfa pasture in the summer and wheat or rye pasture in winter should be provided for the <b>brood</b> <b>sow</b> all their lives. Clover and alfalfa hay are relished in the winter. About an acre per sow would be the right amount of pasture. A very desirable grain is oats or a mixture of oats and corn ground up together make an excellent feed for young sows. Some bran and shorts mixed in the slop is very good. This keeps the young sow growing well and the slop gives bulk as does the pasture. It is poor policy to put the young sow you intend for breeding purposes in the fattening pen with the hogs intended for market. This makes her lazy and reduces her power to convert food consumed into feed for the fetus and little pigs as she has not the capacity. She will have need of a good digestive apparatus when through it she has to furnish food for eight or twelve pigs for from five to twelve weeks. The place where the grain is fed to the sows should be dry and exceedingly clean as it is conducive to good health and pigs are clean animals if you will give them a chance to be such. The dust on the feeding floor is injurious to their lings and by or with dust a great many disease germs are transmitted. The sow should have plenty of clean water to drink and slop at meal time. The trough should never be allowed to become sour...|$|E
40|$|Successful pork {{production}} depends first upon {{selection of}} good breeding stock. The {{ability to produce}} and nurse a large litter well and impart to the litter efficiency {{in the use of}} feed is essential in the inheritance of the breeding stock selected. Equally important are proper feeding and management of the <b>brood</b> <b>sow</b> and her litter. It is a good plan to separate the gilts from the fattening hogs at 4 to 5 months of age and feed them a growing ration. Whole oats or a mixture of one-half oats and barley or wheat coarsely ground, self-fed, constitute a good foundation for a ration. Enough corn should be fed, probably a couple of ears daily, to each gilt to keep her gaining. One-half gallon of skimmilk daily or 1 / 4 pound of protein concentrate will furnish sufficient protein for one gilt in addition to what she obtains from grain and pasture. (The protein concentrate may be hand-fed or mixed with the grain on the basis of 5 pounds to each 100 pounds of grain. ...|$|E
40|$|Approved, F. B. MumfordTypescriptIncludes bibliographical referencesM. A. University of Missouri 1913 There is no animal {{contributing}} {{directly to}} the food supply of the people {{which is at the}} same time so genera 1 ly kept and so little understood as the pig. Nor is there one which, intimately associated as it is with their welfare, is so generally appreciated by the rural classes. While some farmers formerly bred and fed pigs for the purpose of consuming inferior and waste stuff and the production of manure, the farmer of to-day keeps a sow for the profit and satisfaction which she returns him in addition to the above. There are few farms in the United States today upon which there is not a <b>brood</b> <b>sow.</b> The sow occupies a high position with the farmer and contributes more to his prosperity than almost anything to which he devotes attention. America has long been known as a swine-producing country of surpassing excellence, and claims to produce and consume more pork than any other nation. Missouri alone, in 1907. sent to market 3, 878, 863 head of hogs valued at $ 38, 788, 630, and at that time Missouri ranked as fifth state in the Union in swine production.

40|$|Records on {{the farm}} {{business}} obtained from 233 herds of hogs in Humboldt County {{during the period from}} 1922 to 1925 showed that the hogs on these farms provided a means of marketing about half the corn raised and provided between 35 and 40 percent of the total farm income. On the medium sized farms in this county between 15 and 20 <b>brood</b> <b>sows</b> were kept per farm. The number seldom ran over 20, because on a one-family farm it was limited to the number one man could look after at farrowing time. One hundred fifty-nine detailed records were obtained on the hog enterprise. These showed a wide range each year in costs and profits. The hog producer’s problem is to obtain the largest net return from his resources. This involves caring for his breeding herd so as to obtain thrifty pigs at the lowest cost per pig at weaning and, second, obtaining the most economical gains on the fattening pigs. The high costs of pigs weaned were usually associated with inadequate rations, poor care of the breeding herd and preventable losses after farrowing. It was found that where litters farrowed one additional strong pig, the number weaned was increased by six-tenths pig per litter on an average, while more than the average number of weak pigs farrowed meant smaller than average litters weaned...|$|R
5000|$|Murphy {{published}} his first collection of poetry, The Deed Of Gift, in 1998; the collection represents all of Murphy's {{work as a}} poet through about 1996. In a contemporary review of the volume, Gerry Cambridge summarized Murphy's accomplishment: [...] "There are outstanding poems here, including ‘Harvest of Sorrows’, ‘Sunset at the Getty’, and ‘The Quarrel’, {{as well as a}} great number of very likeable, individual, and tautly-made pieces. It would be hard to confuse Murphy with any other contemporary poet. No one else writing poetry in English sounds quite like him." [...] As poet Dick Davis has noted, this distinctive style owes much to Murphy's use of traditional meter and rhyme, unusual among poets today: [...] "His poems are wholly his own, and yet the voice in them lives in and through his mastery of traditional metre, which is so thorough as to seem indivisible from the poems’ sensibility and meaning." [...] This focus on rhyme and meter is exemplified in the following excerpt from [...] "Harvest of Sorrows": :When swift brown swallows:return to their burrows:and diamond willows:leaf in the hollows,:when barrows wallow:and <b>brood</b> <b>sows</b> farrow,:we sow the black furrows:behind our green harrows. excerpt from [...] "Harvest of Sorrows" [...] Murphy’s publications are now the province of The North Dakota State University Press. Their first publication is Devotions, a substantial (160 page) selected poems that gathers poems from his return to the Catholic Church in 2005 through 2012. Dana Gioia concludes his introduction: “These are genuine poems rooted in a passionate encounter with the divine. I predict they will find many devoted readers.” Later in 2017 they will publish Hunter’s Log, Volumes II and III, twice the length of Volume I, which will again feature illustrations by the great Eldridge Hardie. Murphy jokes that he has more inventory than Ford Motor Company, and he has eight more individual collections in queue at his hometown press. Like Mortal Stakes/Faint Thunder they will appear as four double volumes. They are Miles to Go/Winter in the Woods, Works and Days/Travels with Chucky, Creature of the Wild/Fall Ploughing, and Grave Grandeur/Songs and Sonets. When these appear they will bring his twelve individual collections to more than 1000 pages.|$|R
