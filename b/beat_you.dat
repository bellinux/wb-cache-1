500|$|Interest in {{adapting}} Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? developed {{shortly after}} its 1968 publication. Director Martin Scorsese {{was interested in}} filming the novel, but never optioned it. Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: [...] "Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project. And the first thing I said {{to him when he}} got off the plane was, 'Shall I <b>beat</b> <b>you</b> up here at the airport, or shall I <b>beat</b> <b>you</b> up back at my apartment? ...|$|E

Gordon was fifth with 65 points. Ford maintained their lead in the Manufacturers' Championship with 12 points.

[...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E

500|$|A preview {{screening}} of Sweet Smell of Success was poorly received, as Tony Curtis fans were {{expecting him to}} play one of his typical nice guy roles and instead were presented with the scheming Sidney Falco. Mackendrick remembered seeing audience members [...] "curling up, crossing their arms and legs, recoiling from the screen in disgust". Burt Lancaster's fans were not thrilled with their idol either, [...] "finding the film too static and talky". The film was a box office failure, and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill. [...] "The night of the preview, Harold said to me, 'You know you've wrecked our company? We're going to lose {{over a million dollars}} on this picture,'" [...] Hill recalled. However, Lancaster blamed Lehman, who remembers a confrontation they had: [...] "Burt threatened me at a party after the preview.

500|$|Reviewers {{have criticized}} the game for its high and unforgiving {{difficulty}} level especially late in the game, {{and it has been}} considered an example of [...] "Nintendo Hard" [...] video games. A review from 1UP.com referred to the latter levels as an [...] "unfair display of intentional cheapness". In his review of the Virtual Console version, GameSpot's Alex Navarro said [...] "the game will <b>beat</b> <b>you</b> to a pulp" [...] and that it [...] "assaults you time and time again with its punishing difficulty, insidiously placed enemies, and rage-inducing boss fights". According to his review, the game starts easy, but the difficulty starts to increase halfway through the second Act and continues through the sixth Act; Navarro describes the sixth Act's difficulty as being [...] "one of the bottom levels of gaming hell". IGN said that this game {{was one of the most}} difficult video games of all time, setting the trend for the rest of the series; however, they pointed out that its difficulty and graphics are [...] "defining characteristics [...] have carried over through the years into modern day [...] Gaiden sequels".
