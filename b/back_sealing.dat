500|$|Following this, the division's {{next major}} {{engagement}} came on 4 October 1917 when it {{took part in}} the Battle of Broodseinde Ridge. This time the 9th Brigade was held back in reserve, while the 10th and 11th Brigades led the division forward. Attacking on the left of the Australian 2nd Division and the right of the New Zealand Division, early {{on the morning of the}} scheduled start of the attack the German artillery opened up on the division's eight assaulting infantry battalions as they stood to in the open ready to step off. Conserving their artillery for the main attack, the supporting Allied artillery only provided limited counter-battery fire and the division suffered heavily as they were forced to endure an hour-long barrage before zero hour came at 6am. As the 37th and 43rd Battalions led the advance towards the German lines, supported by small teams of mortarmen and machine gunners, the Germans launched their own attack, however, the Australian assault had taken them by surprise and after some initial resistance, the German assault troops began to fall back or surrender. As the follow-on battalions exploited the ground gained in the initial assault the advance continued and by 9:15am the 3rd Division had carried the ridge and begun to dig in, having advanced [...] A counterattack late in the day on the 11th Brigade's position was turned <b>back,</b> <b>sealing</b> a stunning success for the 3rd Division. Nevertheless, the division's casualties were high, with over 1,800 men killed or wounded. For his actions during the attack, Walter Peeler, a Lewis-gunner from the 3rd Pioneer Battalion who was attached to 37th Battalion for anti-aircraft duties received the Victoria Cross after he personally led the assault on a number of German positions.|$|E
50|$|Craft's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:He was a rifleman {{when his}} platoon spearheaded {{an attack on}} Hen Hill, the tactical position on which the entire Naha-Shuri-Yonaburu line of Japanese defense on Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands, was hinged. For 12 days our forces had been stalled, and repeated, heavy assaults by 1 battalion and then another had been thrown back by the enemy with serious casualties. With 5 comrades, Pfc. Craft was dispatched in advance of Company G to feel out the enemy resistance. The group had proceeded only a short distance up the slope when rifle and machinegun fire, coupled with a terrific barrage of grenades, wounded 3 and pinned down the others. Against odds that appeared suicidal, Pfc. Craft launched a remarkable 1-man attack. He stood up {{in full view of}} the enemy and began shooting with deadly marksmanship wherever he saw a hostile movement. He steadily advanced up the hill, killing Japanese soldiers with rapid fire, driving others to cover in their strongly disposed trenches, unhesitatingly facing alone the strength that had previously beaten back attacks in battalion strength. He reached the crest of the hill, where he stood silhouetted against the sky while quickly throwing grenades at extremely short range into the enemy positions. His extraordinary assault lifted the pressure from his company for the moment, allowing members of his platoon to comply with his motions to advance and pass him more grenades. With a chain of his comrades supplying him while he stood atop the hill, he furiously hurled a total of 2 cases of grenades into a main trench and other positions on the reverse slope of Hen Hill, meanwhile directing the aim of his fellow soldiers who threw grenades from the slope below him. He left his position, where grenades from both sides were passing over his head and bursting on either slope, to attack the main enemy trench as confusion and panic seized the defenders. Straddling the excavation, he pumped rifle fire into the Japanese at pointblank range, killing many and causing the others to flee down the trench. Pursuing them, he came upon a heavy machinegun which was still creating havoc in the American ranks. With rifle fire and a grenade he wiped out this position. By this time the Japanese were in complete rout and American forces were swarming over the hill. Pfc. Craft continued down the central trench to the mouth of a cave where many of the enemy had taken cover. A satchel charge was brought to him, and he tossed it into the cave. It failed to explode. With great daring, the intrepid fighter retrieved the charge from the cave, relighted the fuse and threw it <b>back,</b> <b>sealing</b> up the Japs in a tomb. In the local action, against tremendously superior forces heavily armed with rifles, machineguns, mortars, and grenades, Pfc. Craft killed at least 25 of the enemy; but his contribution to the campaign on Okinawa was of much more far-reaching consequence for Hen Hill was the key to the entire defense line, which rapidly crumbled after his utterly fearless and heroic attack.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{ageing effects}} in c-Si PV cells either naturally evolved or induced by external agents, which are shown {{to lead to}} performance degradation of the PV cells and modules. PV modules operating in field conditions for 13, 18 and 22 years are examined. Ageing effects including EVA browning, delamination, corrosion, damage in the <b>back</b> <b>sealing</b> surface, etc., are identified by means of visual observation. Hot spots and hot areas identified by means of IR thermography indicate the location and source of defects. The PV performance degradation is measured through {{an analysis of the}} I-V curves and the electrical characteristics of the modules, and has shown the naturally aged module to be less degraded in terms of its power output than the module which experienced induced ageing effects...|$|E

40|$|Case StudyA 2500 HP {{integral}} gear compressor in an {{air separation}} plant experienced an impeller failure {{in the first stage}} of compression. The failure was extensive and took the dry air compressor off-line. Plant production was curtailed for several weeks. Initial investigation focused on the 1 st stage centrifugal compressor impeller and upstream dust filter. Most of the aluminum impeller was missing and portions of the air filter element had melted. With the sequence and cause unclear, a formal root cause analysis (RCA) was undertaken. The RCA process ultimately revealed that an unexpected thermite reaction occurred and consumed most of the aluminum impeller. During compressor shutdown, products of the intensely exothermic thermite reaction backflowed into the upstream dust filter causing the element to partially melt. The thermite reaction initiated in the impeller <b>back</b> disk <b>seal</b> area where metal oxides and fuel (debris) had collected. Viscous heating and temperatures greater than expected allowed the rotating labyrinth seal to creep. Contact with the babbitted stationary seal generated additional heat and further accelerated the creep process. Frictional heating in the impeller <b>back</b> disk <b>seal</b> initiated the reaction. Corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence included a creep resistant impeller <b>back</b> disk <b>seal</b> and a passive debris removal system to prevent debris particles from collecting in the impeller <b>back</b> disk <b>seal</b> area. This compressor and a twin have operating reliably since 2003. Recent inspection revealed neither <b>back</b> disk <b>seal</b> creep no the collection of debris particles. These facts have verified the effectiveness of the solution...|$|R
30|$|The fluid {{within the}} flow core {{zone of the}} hub plate crown of a {{centrifugal}} pump was regarded as the research object in this study. Based on a comparative analysis of the numerical results on pump performance and the test results, investigations were conducted on {{the flow of the}} hub plate crown at the 0.6 Qsp, 0.8 Qsp, 1.0 Qsp, and 1.2 Qsp operational points to map the axial center fluid of the back shroud and hub cavities and the radial distribution curves of dimensionless tangential and radial velocities at the four different angular positions (0 °, 90 °, 180 °, and 270 °). The study was also aimed to analyze the radial distribution of the dimensionless tangential and radial velocities of the flow field in the back shroud and hub cavities. The test results of <b>back</b> <b>sealing</b> ring leakage of clearance are utilized to verify the accuracy and feasibility of the numerical research (Additional file 1).|$|E
30|$|Figure  7 {{shows that}} the leakage rate {{obtained}} by numerical calculation is in agreement with that obtained by test deduction {{in terms of the}} changing tendency. When the flow rate increases, the pump head decreases, leading to a reduction of both the pressure difference at the inlet and outlet of the <b>back</b> <b>sealing</b> ring and the fluid leakage rate through the clearance. Given that the effect on vortex flow and fluid viscosity is neglected in the theoretical calculation formula, the results obtained by numerical calculation in the same flow operational point are always larger than those obtained by test deduction. However, the relative difference value remains basically unchanged. The relative difference between dimensionless simulation leakage rate and dimensionless test leakage rate is 0.19 % in the flow rate, 1.0 Qsp, at the design operational point. For this reason, the numerical calculation results are in accordance with the test deduction results, thus proving that the research results of this study are accurate, and the numerical calculation method is feasible.|$|E
40|$|With {{crystalline}} silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules {{being on}} the market for over 3 decades, investigation into usual causes and extent of module degradation after prolonged exposure in field conditions is nowadays possible. Degradation phenomena vary significantly between cells, modules and installations, giving rise to different power degradation rates reported. The main defects that have been observed in field aged PV modules, include EVA browning, degradation of the anti-reflective coating, delamination between the glass-encapsulant and the cell-encapsulant interfaces, humidity ingress, corrosion of busbars and contacts, shunt paths, cracks/ micro-cracks in the cell, damage of the glass and the <b>back</b> <b>sealing,</b> and bypass diode failure. This study presents severe degradation effects observed in PV modules operating outdoors for over 20 years. In many of the cases investigated different defects were seen to coexist within the same cell or module, leading to more severe effects of optical/physical, thermal, and electrical degradation phenomena significantly reducing the PV power output. Other modules which exhibited extensive optical/physical degradation showed milder degradation in performance. Detection of module degradation was carried out in this study first through visual inspection and I-V curve analysis. Further non-destructive diagnostic techniques were used such as infrared thermography for the identification of hot spots, that were seen to be mainly linked to resistive busbars and contacts, and electroluminescence imaging for the identification of shunts and other defects. The detection, diagnosis and monitoring of such defects is of great importance for {{a deeper understanding of the}} complex ageing mechanisms that take place after prolonged PV exposure in field conditions, and the identification of underlying causes, assisting the early identification of defects and the extension of the energy life of PV systems...|$|E

30|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{understanding}} in the flow mechanism of the hub plate crown, the current calculation of the disc friction loss and the axial thrust in the centrifugal pump often uses empirical formulas. Research on the flow characteristics of the hub plate crown is of practical significance. The shroud and hub cavities are respectively studied with regard to tangential and radial velocities at the four different angular positions (0 °, 90 °, 180 °, and 270 °) at the four different operational points (0.6 Qsp, 0.8 Qsp, 1.0 Qsp, and 1.2 Qsp). Results indicate that at the same operational point, the smaller the volute chamber sectional area is, the higher the tangential velocity of the fluid core zone of the shroud cavity is. Radial leakage flow from the volute to the seal ring at the same operational point appears in 0 ° and 90 ° direction; when the flow is large, the tangential and radial velocities of the shroud and hub cavities with the same radius tend to be equal with axial symmetry. The axial leakage flow through the balance holes significantly affects the radial distribution of both tangential and radial velocities of fluid flow in the hub cavity. The numerical calculation results of fluid leakage through the clearance of <b>back</b> <b>sealing</b> ring are in good agreement with the test results. Accordingly, the magnitude of leakage is closely related to the fluid pressure and velocity distribution in the hub plate crown of the centrifugal pump. The analysis of the flow characteristics in the hub plate crown of the centrifugal pump could reveal the cause of the disc friction loss from the mechanism, providing a significant guidance for improving the accuracy of calculation and balancing the axial thrust in the centrifugal pump.|$|E
