50|$|On October 30, 2014, ABC {{announced}} that responsibilities for production oversight on The View would shift from ABC's daytime entertainment division to ABC News, where {{the show will}} be grouped under the division's non-fiction programming umbrella, which produces NY Med for the network as well as content for other networks including National Geographic Channel and Discovery Networks. The move in oversight will likely not generate any noticeable changes in The View's content (in recent years, the remainder <b>of</b> <b>ABC's</b> <b>news</b> content has become similarly slanted towards soft news, entertainment, and popular culture); it will, however, allow the show to leverage <b>ABC</b> <b>News's</b> resources more frequently than before, as well as create the possibility of making deals to land big-name guests (something generally forbidden on the newsgathering side). Walters left her role as co-executive producer {{at the end of}} the show's eighteenth season.|$|R

50|$|As {{one article}} {{at the time}} put it, Catterns was {{offering}} something different to the dominant 2GB and 2UE breakfast shows, and appealed to a younger demographic of 30- to 59-year-olds: “702’s mix of warm, intelligent Sydney talk and good music, uninterrupted by advertising and wrapped around a solid digest <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>news</b> and current affairs, is a hard combination to beat”.In 2001, Catterns and the marketing department <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> Local Radio conceived and initiated an event called the KNIT IN. Because she was making scarves for her father and daughter, Catterns had been discussing knitting on her breakfast show.
