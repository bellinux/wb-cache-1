25|$|High-strength {{aluminium}} alloys have the tensile strength of medium strong steel alloys while providing significant weight advantages. Therefore, aluminium forged parts are mainly used in aerospace, automotive industry {{and many other}} fields of engineering especially in those fields, where highest safety standards against failure by abuse, by shock or vibratory stresses are needed. Such parts are for example chassis parts, steering components and <b>brake</b> <b>parts.</b> Commonly used alloys are AlSi1MgMn (EN AW-6082) and AlZnMgCu1,5 (EN AW-7075). About 80% of all aluminium forged parts are made of AlSi1MgMn. The high-strength alloy AlZnMgCu1,5 is mainly used for aerospace applications.|$|E

The {{distribution}} and dimension of contacting pressure and contacting area between friction linings and brake drum have important influence on braking performance. Entire contact theory in this article was found based on the conditions that the outside radius of linings was equal to the inside radius of drum. The relation between the corresponding points on contact surface and the angle which lining rotated around support pin axis was calculated based on entire contact theory. The radial deformation, pressure distribution, contact area of linings and the brake performance were analyzed in the condition of entire contact theory...|$|R

5000|$|In 1975, Cubana's Bristol Britannias were {{pressed into}} service to ferry elite Cuban {{military}} units to Angola, as part of Operation Carlota. The Britannias were modified (with additional fuel tanks placed inside the passenger cabins) by Cubana's technicians, to allow non-stop flights from Cuba to Africa (with a reduced passenger load). This occurred when the U.S. government started to pressure Barbados to cancel Cubana's landing rights for those flights. Modifications to the Britannias included providing access to the cargo bay from the passenger cabins, to facilitate the rapid deployment of weapons and ammunition upon arrival. Nobel Prize winning author Gabriel García Márquez wrote articles in 1977 (and a book) that included narrations about Cubana's Britannias and its pilots flying the first contingent of elite Cuban troops to Angola. [...] The route for those very urgent flights often involved a brief stop at Brazzaville for refueling and information on developments in Luanda. Arrivals in Brazzaville and Luanda were scheduled for nighttime, and the aircraft's exterior and interior lights were turned off before landing, on the ground, and during takeoff to avoid attracting attention. The initial flights were undertaken in secrecy, and helped prevent apartheid South Africa's army from occupying Luanda when Angola gained independence. In all, Cubana's Britannias performed over 100 flights between Cuba and Angola during several months, as part of Operation Carlota. Because spare parts were no longer made or marketed, Cubana's technicians had to manufacture them, and <b>brake</b> <b>parts</b> from Ilyushin IL-18 aircraft were adapted to fit the Britannias. [...] Maintenance time was reduced by half to keep the aircraft operating continuously, {{despite the lack of}} weather reports along the sparsely travelled route. Each flight carried two pilot crews, taking turns at the controls, but pilots often flew beyond their flight-time limits. Shortly after this operation, Cubana established scheduled services between Havana and Luanda. Cubana's Britannias served in the airline's fleet for over three decades (they were retired in 1990), and never experienced any accident.|$|E

First an investigation of correlation problems from tests is proposed. Tools based on the modal assurance criterion are presented to provide a deeper analysis of correlation and results improvement. In a second part, the need of FEM topology correlation and update is demonstrated, using an efficient morphing technique. Tolerances in the manufacturing process that are well accepted in design and production stages are shown to lead to significant degradation of the test/analysis correlation. An application to an industrial <b>brake</b> <b>part</b> is eventually presented, in an approach of correlation procedure automatization for recurrent use...|$|R
