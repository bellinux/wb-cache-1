5|$|In 1907 the A2 class steam {{locomotive}} was introduced. There were 185 locomotives {{in this class}} and they were Victorian Railway's main passenger locomotive until {{the arrival of the}} diesel electric <b>B</b> <b>class</b> in 1952. On 20 April 1908 the Sunshine train disaster occurred, killing 44 passengers in the worst Victorian railway accident.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the opening}} of the line, 17 trains per weekday ran in each {{direction}} at intervals of one hour from around 7am to around 11pm. The initial trains were drawn by Metropolitan Railway A and <b>B</b> <b>Class</b> locomotives. Most trains stopped at all stations, but a fast trains each morning ran between Chesham and Baker Street, taking 50 minutes from start to finish. On Sundays, trains again ran at hourly intervals, but only 12 trains per day ran and there was a three-hour gap in services in the morning to allow the railway's staff to attend church.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} a long-held {{assumption}} {{that the majority of}} stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and <b>B</b> <b>class</b> stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be part of multiple-star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.|$|E

5|$|On opening, the Metropolitan Railway's trains were {{provided}} by the Great Western Railway, but these were withdrawn in August 1863. After a period hiring trains from the Great Northern Railway, the Metropolitan Railway introduced its own, Fowler designed, 4-4-0 tank engines in 1864. The design, known as the A class and, with minor updates, the <b>B</b> <b>class,</b> was so successful that the Metropolitan and District Railways eventually had 120 of the engines in use and they remained in operation until electrification of the lines in the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|The first Royal National Lifeboat {{was funded}} by the town of Cheltenham, and arrived in 1866. The {{lifeboat}} was removed in 1930 because of the difficulty in getting a full crew, and because the launching arrangements were not suitable for a powered boat. The current Burnham-on-Sea Lifeboat Station is the base for Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) search and rescue operations. The present station was opened in 2003. It operates two inshore lifeboats (ILBs), a <b>B</b> <b>Class</b> rigid-hulled boat and an inflatable D Class.|$|E
5|$|From 1879, more {{locomotives}} were needed, and {{the design}} was updated and 24 were delivered between 1879 and 1885. Originally they were painted bright olive green lined in black and yellow, chimneys copper capped with the locomotive number in brass figures at the front and domes of polished brass. In 1885, the colour changed to a dark red known as Midcared, and this was to remain the standard colour, taken up as the colour for the Metropolitan line by London Transport in 1933. When in 1925 the Met classified its locomotives by letters of the alphabet, these were assigned A Class and <b>B</b> <b>Class.</b> When the M was being built, it was considered that they would struggle on the gradients and five Worcester Engine 0-6-0 tank locomotives were delivered in 1868. It was soon found that A and B Classes could manage trains without difficulty and the 0-6-0Ts were sold to the Taff Vale Railway in 1873 and 1875.|$|E

5|$|On 14 July 1952 the VR {{entered the}} diesel era, with the {{delivery}} of the first <b>B</b> <b>class</b> mainline locomotive, with the commissioning of the first mainline electrification scheme in Australia in July 1954 to Warragul. March 1954 saw Queen Elizabeth II tour Victoria by Royal Train, {{the first time a}} reigning monarch had travelled on the VR, 1954 also saw the last steam locomotive to enter service, J class 559, as well as the last four wheeled open wagons being built. The fifties also saw the loss of a number of short branch lines, particularly country where the only traffic had been timber or livestock.|$|E
5|$|These {{ships were}} based on the {{preceding}} <b>B</b> <b>class,</b> but were enlarged to increase their endurance and to allow for the inclusion of a QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun. This class introduced a director control tower for British destroyers. The 'C' class were unique in having a split bridge, with the compass platform and wheelhouse separated from the chartroom and director tower. This unusual layout was not repeated. As per Admiralty policy in alternating Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear and ASDIC (sonar) capability between destroyer flotillas, the C class lacked ASDIC and were designed to carry only six depth charges. The D class were repeats of the C's, except that the TSDS was replaced by storage for up to 30 depth charges and ASDIC.|$|E

25|$|From 1952 {{deliveries}} of <b>B</b> <b>class</b> {{diesel locomotives}} commenced {{and the new}} locomotives quickly proved their superiority to steam traction in availability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of operation. Following successful trials, the <b>B</b> <b>class</b> locomotives replaced the S class locomotives on the Spirit of Progress roster from April 1954. None of the iconic streamlined steam locomotives were saved for preservation, all were withdrawn and scrapped by September 1954.|$|E
25|$|While the <b>B</b> <b>class</b> {{locomotives}} {{were highly}} successful on the expensively-engineered 1860s mainlines {{for which they}} were designed, they were less suited for the more cheaply built extensions to the VR system. Future VR express passenger locomotives were to use a four-wheel leading bogie to steer the locomotive, and from 1884 a class of 4-4-0 locomotives (later classed 'Old A') began to supplement, and eventually supersede the <b>B</b> <b>class.</b> Despite the delivery of the Old A, and the later and increasingly larger 'New A' and AA class 4-4-0s of 1889 and 1900 respectively, the entire <b>B</b> <b>class</b> (other than a couple of accident write-offs) lasted into the Twentieth century, with their roles ranging from double heading on express passenger trains down to shunting duties.|$|E

The Gippsland line, which was electrified to Traralgon by 1955, was the first line to see the complete withdrawal of the R class from service. On 18 May 1964, R 703 worked the last regular steam-hauled passenger train out of Melbourne, the 6:05pm Geelong service.|$|E
