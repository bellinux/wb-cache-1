5|$|Baseball {{has also}} {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and <b>biographical</b> <b>data.</b> Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, {{the scale}} of psychiatric abuses in the past, the use of psychiatric doctrines by the totalitarian state have been thoroughly concealed. The archives of the Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Health (USSR Health Ministry), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, which between them hold evidence about the expansion of psychiatry and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky. Dan Healey shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: {{the contents of the}} main archives are still classified and inaccessible. Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement where Gluzman saw them in 1989. All are marked by numbers without names or surnames, and any <b>biographical</b> <b>data</b> they contain is unresearched and inaccessible to researchers.|$|E

25|$|Personnel {{selection}} is the systematic process of hiring and promoting personnel. Personnel selection systems employ evidence-based practices {{to determine the}} most qualified candidates. Personnel selection involves both the newly hired and individuals who can be promoted from within the organization.

25|$|Recently, {{scholarship}} {{dealing with}} 17th-century female writers has increased.

They all situate Makin within a rich body of historical women, although these texts provide <b>biographical</b> <b>data</b> on Makin that is now viewed as incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the lack}} of {{accurate}} <b>biographical</b> <b>data,</b> there has been some controversy over the veracity of Marie de Romieu’s authorship of her Discourse over the superiority of women over men, which appeared on her Les Premières Oeuvres Poétiques (1581), as well of the translation Instruction for Young Women (1572). Discourse, published by her brother Jacques de Romieu, has been attributed to Jacques himself by some critics. However, according to French poet Guillaume Colletet, Marie’s style on her Premières Oeuvres is more refined than that of her brother’s, which was “rough and hard” in his own work. In translation of Instruction for Young Women, the only reference to an author refers to the initials M.D.R., which could belong to her, but also to other French authors of the time besides Marie, such as Madeleine des Roches.|$|E

25|$|In 1955 Krätschmer {{published}} the book Rtterkreuzträger der Waffen-SS. Featuring a foreword by Paul Hausser, formerly {{one of the}} highest ranking commanders of the Waffen-SS, Krätschmer's work was one of the earliest attempts to shape a positive image of the Waffen-SS after the war. Historians note that Krätschmer uncitically presented perpetrators like Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, Oskar Dirlewanger, Theodor Eicke, Curt von Gottberg and Bruno Streckenbach as honest soldiers and claimed that war criminals like Walter Reder, Fritz Knöchlein, Bernhard Siebken and Jochen Peiper were victims of victor's justice. On persons who had been actively and decisively involved in the planning and execution of the Nazi policy of extermination, like Friedrich Jeckeln, Friedrich Wilhelm Krüger, Streckenbach and Dirlewanger, only basic <b>biographical</b> <b>data</b> were given. Jens Westemeier points to erroneous claims by Krätschmer about Jochen Peiper's career, by which Peiper's involvement with Heinrich Himmler was minimized, and to Krätschmer's denial of war crimes.|$|E

However, {{little attention has been}} paid to how subjects interpret and construct waste in their daily lives.

500|$|Francis Galton (1822–1911) was {{a pioneer}} in {{investigating}} both eminent human achievement and mental testing. In his book Hereditary Genius, writing before the development of IQ testing, he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong, and that eminence is rare in the general population. Lewis Terman chose near' genius or genius" [...] as the classification label for the highest classification on his 1916 version of the Stanford–Binet test. By 1926, Terman began publishing about a longitudinal study of California schoolchildren who were referred for IQ testing by their schoolteachers, called Genetic Studies of Genius, which he conducted {{for the rest of}} his life. Catherine M. Cox, a colleague of Terman's, wrote a whole book, The Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses, published as volume 2 of The Genetic Studies of Genius book series, in which she analyzed <b>biographical</b> <b>data</b> about historic geniuses. Although her estimates of childhood IQ scores of historical figures who never took IQ tests have been criticized on methodological grounds, Cox's study was thorough in finding out what else matters besides IQ in becoming a genius. By the 1937 second revision of the Stanford–Binet test, Terman no longer used the term [...] "genius" [...] as an IQ classification, nor has any subsequent IQ test. In 1939, Wechsler specifically commented that [...] "we are rather hesitant about calling a person a genius on the basis of a single intelligence test score." ...|$|E
