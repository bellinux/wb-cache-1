The family owned several shops in Jakarta, including one in Blok M and another in Tanah Abang. <b>Beginning</b> <b>when</b> he was {{in junior high school}} Arnada helped the family with the shops, using his free time to read. Arnada was raised in a Muslim family and has remained a devout Muslim.|$|E
5|$|An {{understanding}} of the artistic personality of Gasparo Cairano has to be mediated by a proper contextualization of the contemporary art scene of Brescia. He {{can be referred to}} as a novice artist at the <b>beginning,</b> <b>when</b> the Lombard migrant, like many of his contemporaries, arrived in Brescia during the innovative construction of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli and started a successful career. That historic moment, with the municipality in search of innovating artists, was also beneficial: he proved able to interpret in stone the boastful self-celebration of the high offices, public and private, of renaissance Brescia. He quickly became the leading innovator of sculptural practice in the region, continually outperforming the already weak competition, which appeared mainly in the shape of Sanmicheli and Antonio della Porta.|$|E
5|$|The {{bibliography}} of Fyodor Dostoyevsky comprises novels, novellas, short stories, essays and other literary works. Raised by a literate family, Dostoyevsky discovered literature {{at an early}} age, <b>beginning</b> <b>when</b> his mother introduced the Bible to him. Nannies near the hospitalsin the grounds {{of which he was}} raisedintroduced Dostoyevsky to fairy tales, legends and sagas. His mother's subscription to the Library of Reading gave him access to the leading contemporary Russian and non-Russian literature. After his mother's death, Dostoyevsky moved from a boarding school to a military academy and despite the resulting lack of money, he was captivated by literature until his death.|$|E

5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy to have someone in the {{orchestra}} slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring {{the hell out of}} everyone. The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the <b>beginning,</b> <b>when</b> Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1824 Heber {{set out on}} a tour of {{northern}} India, accompanied by his personal chaplain, Martin Stowe, and Daniel Corrie, the Archdeacon of Calcutta. Amelia remained in Calcutta; earlier in the year she had given birth to her third daughter, Harriet. The general plan was to travel by boat to the upper waters of the River Ganges, then overland into the foothills of the Himalayas before turning south and west, crossing Rajputana to reach Bombay. The journey was almost aborted near to its <b>beginning</b> <b>when</b> Stowe fell ill in Dacca and died there; after some hesitation, Heber decided that the tour should continue. Early in August the party reached Benares (now Varanasi), the largest of the cities in the Ganges plain, where Heber spent several weeks. It was a wholly Indian city without a European population, sacred to Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists but with a well-established CMS school and a substantial Christian minority. Heber consecrated a new church, and when he conducted a Holy Communion service in both English and Hindustani, a large congregation of Christians and Hindus thronged the church.|$|E
5|$|The African {{species is}} a partial migrant, but its {{movements}} are complex, seasonal and poorly studied. It is mainly a wet-season breeder, and many birds {{move away from}} the equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow them to breed elsewhere. Southward movement is mainly from November to April, the return north <b>beginning</b> <b>when</b> burning or drought reduces the grass cover again. This species is present throughout the year in some West African countries, and in equatorial regions, but even in those areas numbers vary seasonally due to local movements; internal north–south migration has been noted within countries including Nigeria, Senegal, The Gambia, Côte d'Ivoire and Cameroon. This crake has also wandered further afield. It is rare on Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea), and there have been two records each for São Tomé and Tenerife, the Canary Islands birds being the first records for the Western Palaeartic.|$|E

5|$|This crake is {{a partial}} migrant, but {{although}} it is less skulking than many of its relatives, its movements are complex and poorly studied; the distribution map is therefore largely hypothetical. It is mainly a wet-season breeder, and many birds {{move away from the}} equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow them to breed elsewhere. Southward movement is mainly from November to April, the return north <b>beginning</b> <b>when</b> burning or drought reduces the grass cover again. This species is present throughout the year in some West African countries, and in equatorial regions, but even in those areas numbers vary seasonally due to local movements; north-south migration has been noted within countries including Nigeria, Senegal, The Gambia, Ivory Coast and Cameroon. Migration takes place at night and involves small groups of up to eight birds; It may be one or two months after the rains begin before the grass is sufficiently high for breeding birds to arrive. Even in southern Africa, some birds may stay after breeding if enough usable habitat remains.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, which were more typical action role-playing games, Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler, {{and the majority of}} the gameplay takes place in selected locations rather than on an open world map. The player selects these areas on the world map to reach them. The primary objective in each location is to clear the dungeon of monsters. Each dungeon is divided into different randomly generated floors, and to progress between each zone, the player must find an item called a Gleamdrop, then carry it to a pillar of light called a Gleamwell. The player must repeat this process on each floor of the dungeon until the last floor is reached, where a boss monster lies. The player can not return to previous floors unless they die or leave the dungeon; upon returning, they start the dungeon over at the <b>beginning.</b> <b>When</b> not clearing dungeons, the player stays in the Mana Village, which contains shops to purchase equipment. Dungeons can be returned to later by accepting quests from townsfolk in the Dudbear shop. During these quests, the dungeon itself is slightly altered: the player's starting position may be different, the number of floors can change, and the monsters and boss monster contained may change. Like the main quests, Dudbear quests involve clearing the dungeon of monsters, sometimes to acquire an item {{from the end of the}} dungeon.|$|E
