50|$|Hence, {{this school}} argues {{that there are}} faster impact {{measurement}} technologies that can account {{for a range of}} publication types as well as social media web coverage of a scientific contribution to arrive at a complete evaluation of how impactful the science contribution was. The gist of the argument for this school is that hidden uses like reading, <b>bookmarking,</b> <b>sharing,</b> discussing and rating are traceable activities, and these traces can and should be used to develop a newer measure of scientific impact. The umbrella jargon for this new type of impact measurements is called altmetrics, coined in a 2011 article by Priem et al., (2011). Markedly, the authors discuss evidence that altmetrics differ from traditional webometrics which are slow and unstructured. Altmetrics are proposed to rely upon a greater set of measures that account for tweets, blogs, discussions, and bookmarks. The authors claim that the existing literature has often proposed that altmetrics should also encapsulate the scientific process, and measure the process of research and collaboration to create an overall metric. However, the authors are explicit in their assessment that few papers offer methodological details as to how to accomplish this. The authors use this and the general dearth of evidence to conclude that {{research in the area of}} altmetrics is still in its infancy.|$|E

This study discussed the feasibility of the integration of learning theories and social bookmarking service through some cases. The possible aims of social bookmarking service emphasize the use of web 2. 0 technology in learning; the collection, and sharing of information; discussions with peers; and construction of learning communities. In this study, we have illustrated the social bookmarking service and the possible learning opportunities successfully. Further study should examine the effectiveness of social bookmarking service in different fields, forms of learning (e. g., alone or group), tasks (e. g., structured or ill-structured), forms of evaluation (e. g., summative or formative), and forms of community (e. g., community of practice or community of knowledge creation) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRecently, social {{bookmarking}} systems have received surging attention in academic and industrial communities. In fact, social <b>bookmarking</b> systems <b>share</b> with the Semantic Web vision {{the idea of}} facilitating the collaborative organization and sharing of knowledge on the web. The reason for the apparent success of the upcoming tools for resource <b>sharing</b> (social <b>bookmarking</b> systems, photo <b>sharing</b> systems, etc.) lies mainly {{in the fact that}} no specific skills are needed for publishing and editing, and an immediate benefit is yielded to each individual user, e. g., organizing one's bookmarks in a browser-independent, persistent fashion, without too much overhead. As these systems grow larger, however, the users address the need of enhanced search facilities. Today, full-text search is supported, but the results are usually simply listed decreasingly by their upload date. The challenging research issue is, therefore, the development of a suitable prediction framework to support users in effectively retrieving the resources matching their real search intents. The primary focus of this chapter is to propose a new, context aware tag query prediction approach. Specifically, the authors adopted Hidden Markov Models and formal concept analysis to predict users' search intentions based on a real folksonomy. Carried out experiments emphasize the relevance of the proposal and open many issue...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we give an {{overview}} of the int. ere. st for a social tagging, <b>bookmarking,</b> and <b>sharing</b> service. It is based on the SCOT ontology. The SCOT ontology can represent the structure and semantics for social tagging data and provide methods for sharing and reusing them. We describe how it enables users to participate in a semantic social tagging from functional point of view and show how int. ere. st allows users to save, tag, and search SCOT ontologies. All kinds of user contributions in the system will be exposed as RDF vocabularies that connect them. We believe it is a good starting point to build Semantic Web based society using tagging data. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWeb co-{{discover}}y, {{which means}} a certain group members collaboratively discover web resources for learning, has become imperative in authentic, open-ended learning environment. Group members may select, organize and further construct their own knowledge via web co-discovery activities. Current groupwares support web co-search, providing <b>bookmark</b> <b>sharing,</b> social tagging of bookmarks, and labor management functions. These groupwares efficiently facilitate distance Web co-discovery, however, face-to-face Web co-discovery is not supported. A framework to assist group members to integrate materials and ideas is not emphasized as well. In addition, a lack of a shared-focus may lead to barriers to social communications. Concept map, featuring linking related contributions, enables students to link, coordinate, organize and further integrate different ideas and discussion that reflect their reasoning. CELL (Contribution of Exchanging for Linking & Learning) is a groupware used concept map as the framework to facilitate group members to construct their collective knowledge (Liu and Kao, 2007). Therefore, this study implements CELL in a Web co-discovery activity and further explores whether 1 : 1 (1 mobile device for 1 person) better benefit members’ communication and interaction. Nine graduate students {{participated in this study}} and were divided into three groups. Every group was asked use CELL to achieve Web co-discovery tasks in two settings both equipped with one shared-display, 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 (1 mobile device for 3 persons). The whole process was videotaped and transcribed in terms of interaction, conversation and users’ operation behaviors. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed to evaluate time ration of operate screen, classification of conversation and knowledge management. The result shows different environment may change group exploration strategy. 1 : 1 environment better supports the members’ coordination and interaction and enrich the artifact of group exploration. However, participants in 1 : 1 environment may focus on personal device and thus show less oral communication than 1 : 3 environment. Future studies should be alerted to the limitation of 1 : 1 environment...|$|R
