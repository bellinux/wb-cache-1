5|$|By 1934, {{there was}} a large system of {{interconnected}} bridle paths along trails and park roads. One <b>bridle</b> <b>path</b> ran close by to the lake, intersecting with Mosholu Avenue, before looping around the Parade Ground and diverging in the Northwest Woods. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course also had trails, as did the Old Croton Aqueduct and near Jerome Avenue and Holly Lane. However, as the primary roads through the park such as Jerome, Grand, and Mosholu Avenues were constantly maintained and upgraded, secondary roads fell into a state of neglect. One such road was Rockwood Drive, which was closed in 1936 and became a <b>bridle</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
5|$|A geology party, {{headed by}} Manasseh Cutler, named the {{mountain}} in 1784. The Crawford Path, the oldest mountain hiking trail in the United States, was laid out in 1819 as a <b>bridle</b> <b>path</b> from Crawford Notch to the summit {{and has been in}} use ever since. Ethan Allen Crawford built a house on the summit in 1821, which lasted until a storm in 1826.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Brittan had varied {{interests}} and immediately upon arrival in Christchurch, joined others in various activities. He played cricket in Hagley Park within a fortnight of reaching Christchurch, and later helped improve the grounds and {{raised money for}} fencing the area. He was into horse racing, later bred horses, and Canterbury's first steeplechase was held on his Linwood farm. The Brittans were into music and his wife Sophia Brittan brought her piano from England. Joseph Brittan had a portable harmonium and as in the early years, Lyttelton was culturally more important than Christchurch, he joined a musical group in the port town. For performances, he walked over the <b>Bridle</b> <b>Path</b> with the instrument strapped to his back. Musical evenings were also held at the Brittan home.|$|E
50|$|Apartments {{began to}} replace older {{homes in the}} {{vicinity}} of the parkway after World War II. Horse racing took place on the parkway until 1908, when a ban on open betting took effect. Until the parkway zoning was changed and restoration was carried out in the 1970s, <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> existed as well. The <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> were on the eastern side of Ocean Parkway; equestrians could rent horses near Prospect Park and ride them on Ocean Parkway as far as Coney Island. Although one can still rent horses at the nearby Kensington Stables, the <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> on Ocean Parkway have since been paved over and are no longer in use.|$|R
50|$|Several {{good public}} {{footpaths}} give {{access to the}} countryside & there are <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> for horse riders & cyclists.|$|R
50|$|Rge forest {{contains}} {{a network of}} <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> for horseback riding {{as well as a}} trail for mountain biking.|$|R
5|$|The notch first {{appears in}} {{recorded}} history in 1784, when an expedition led by Jeremy Belknap camped in the notch before ascending {{to the summit}} of Mount Washington through Huntington Ravine. Pinkham Notch was far more isolated than neighboring Crawford Notch; as a result, the first settler of Pinkham Notch came in 1827, 43years after habitation of Crawford Notch. The first settler, Hayes Copp, built a homestead in the then-uninhabited area, near where the Dolly Copp campground stands today. Copp and his wife lived alone in the wilderness until Daniel Pinkham completed the first road through the notch between in 1836, finally providing {{a link between the}} Copp homestead and civilization. In 1851, a railroad was built to Gorham, and a hotel, the Glen House, was constructed to accommodate passengers. Mount Washington was the main attraction in the area; a <b>bridle</b> <b>path</b> was constructed from the Glen House to hotels on the summit, which was later improved into what would become the Mount Washington Auto Road. Completion of the road in 1861 led to a massive increase in tourism.|$|E
25|$|Thoroughbred: pulled {{with short}} <b>bridle</b> <b>path.</b> May be braided {{depending}} on discipline.|$|E
25|$|Harness racing: pulled or natural, Standardbreds {{often with}} a long <b>bridle</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
50|$|Richmond Park {{also has}} <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> and horses can be rented {{from a number}} of stables around the {{perimeter}} of the park.|$|R
5000|$|Urban <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> {{exist in}} Philadelphia's Fairmount Park (most notably Forbidden Drive along the Wissahickon Creek) and New York City's Central Park ...|$|R
50|$|Horse riding: It is a {{sport of}} big emotions. It is practiced on <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> with Peruvian horses that {{were raised in}} the Callejón de Huaylas.|$|R
25|$|Icelandic horse: {{nowadays}} manes {{are left}} untrimmed, <b>bridle</b> <b>path</b> clipping is inappropriate. Thick and long manes are preferred.|$|E
25|$|The park is also traversed by a <b>bridle</b> <b>path.</b> That path circumscribes both golf courses, with a spur to the Bronx Equestrian Center.|$|E
25|$|Regina's early promise soon failed {{with the}} stock market crash of 1929 and the long years of prairie drought which followed; the {{neighbourhood}} remains the closest approximation in Regina to Toronto's Forest Hill and <b>Bridle</b> <b>Path.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The street's name is {{frequently}} misspelled as [...] "The Bridal Path" [...] {{by those who}} are unfamiliar with the history of the area. The actual [...] "Bridle Path" [...] name came about as early plans for the neighbourhood included an elaborate system of equestrian <b>bridle</b> <b>paths,</b> as most of the estate owners in the area preceding its development were horse-owners. While the paths have since been paved over, their legacy remains in the <b>Bridle</b> <b>Path's</b> wide streets and in the name of this elite community.|$|R
25|$|Mosholu and Pelham Parkways, with Bronx Park between them, Van Cortlandt Park to {{the west}} and Pelham Bay Park to the east, are also linked by <b>bridle</b> <b>paths.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pierce Meadow was {{formerly}} {{part of a}} private estate belonging to Harry W. Pierce circa 1900. Pierce's estate once featured [...] "a twenty-nine-room stucco mansion with a ballroom and conservatory, a matching stable, extensive horse paddocks, Pierce Pond, and an extensive system of <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> through woodland and around the pond." [...] 10 acre of Pierce's estate have been restored as a community park; the pond and <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> {{are not part of}} the current reservation. Trees and shrubs on the property are part of the estate's original plantings.|$|R
25|$|The <b>bridle</b> <b>path</b> is clipped or pulled, {{usually only}} 1–2inches. The animal's coat may be trimmed. American stables almost always trim the muzzle, face, ears, and legs, while European stables {{do not have}} such a strict {{tradition}} and may leave different parts untrimmed.|$|E
25|$|The Simeon {{family with}} five children, a housekeeper, a governess, a lady's maid, a housemaide, a nurse, a cook and a footman left England from the East India Docks on 18 June 1851 {{on the ship}} Canterbury and arrived on 21 October in Lyttelton. Lyttelton {{inhabitants}} were amazed {{about the size of}} the party. The children and servants were put up at the Mitre in Lyttelton at a cost of £4 10s per day until he had found a town house to rent on the <b>Bridle</b> <b>Path.</b> He bought town section 102 in Lyttelton's Coleridge Street (today Coleridge Terrace), not far from the rented house, and built a substantial house with eight rooms near where the <b>Bridle</b> <b>Path</b> goes over the hill to Christchurch. This latter house is still standing and is registered as a Category II historic place by Heritage New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Saddle seat: Natural, {{although}} a few long braids (usually forelock and 1 or 2 in the mane) are permitted on gaited breeds and on American Saddlebreds, usually with a colorful ribbon attached that complements the rider's clothing. Three-gaited Saddlebreds have roached manes; in five-gaited Saddlebreds the mane is left long, with a long <b>bridle</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{hiking and}} <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> {{have already been}} {{established}} with the park, {{one of which is}} a spectacular 39 km trail linking the Ts'ehlanyane National Park with the Bokong Nature Reserve.|$|R
6000|$|It {{is quite}} true that if <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> can be {{described}} as highways, [...] there may be said to be a meeting-point of these close at the [...] north-eastern side of the crag.|$|R
5000|$|On longer trails, like <b>bridle</b> <b>paths,</b> rail trails, {{farm and}} forest roads and towpaths. The South Downs Way in England and the Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath Trail, in the USA would be examples.|$|R
25|$|Though very {{interested}} in the American Civil War and Mathew Brady's battlefield photographs, Hopper made only two historical paintings. Both depicted soldiers on their way to Gettysburg. Also rare among his themes are paintings showing action. The best example of an action painting is <b>Bridle</b> <b>Path</b> (1939), but Hopper's struggle with the proper anatomy of the horses may have discouraged him from similar attempts.|$|E
25|$|Quite late, {{compared}} to other pass routes through the Alps on a north-south axis (e.g. Simplon, San Bernardino, Brenner), namely in 1822, the first Saint-Gotthard Pass road was established after centuries-long usage of a <b>bridle</b> <b>path.</b> From 1842 onwards, a daily course by the Gotthard Post, a stagecoach drawn by five horses with ten seats, still took about 23 hours from Como to Flüelen.|$|E
25|$|Arabian and part-Arabian: long, unbraided, {{and natural}} in all events, {{with a long}} <b>bridle</b> <b>path,</b> except for horses shown in hunt seat classes. If the horse shows in {{multiple}} disciplines where a long mane is generally mandatory, the mane is French braided for dressage, show hack, or hunt seat competition, but if the animal is shown only as a hunter, jumper or in dressage, the mane may be pulled and braided.|$|E
60|$|Noblesse oblige? Surely. So {{out along}} the {{driveways}} and <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> trots Hudson Van Sweller in the uniform of his incapacitated comrade, as like unto him as one French pea is unto a petit pois.|$|R
50|$|A {{system of}} <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> forms a picturesque {{labyrinth}} of walks connecting the different bungalows. Indian penal servitude prisoners shipped from Bencoolen, Sumatra to Penang {{during the second}} half of the 19th century built these by-paths.|$|R
50|$|Common {{features}} of municipal parks include playgrounds, gardens, hiking, running and fitness trails or <b>paths,</b> <b>bridle</b> <b>paths,</b> sports fields and courts, public restrooms, boat ramps and/or picnic facilities, {{depending on the}} budget and natural features available.|$|R
25|$|Banbury {{stands at}} the {{junction}} of two ancient roads: Salt Way (used as a <b>bridle</b> <b>path</b> {{to the west and}} south of the town), its primary use being transport of salt; and Banbury Lane, which began near Northampton and is closely followed by the modern 22-mile-long road. It continued through what is now Banbury's High Street and towards the Fosse Way at Stow-on-the-Wold. Banbury's mediæval prosperity was based on wool.|$|E
25|$|The site {{lies within}} a private estate on Phillip's Hill, and within Bussock Wood. There are various lanes and paths {{running through the}} wood, however none of them appear as public rights of way. There is a public <b>bridle</b> <b>path</b> that runs east to west, {{slightly}} {{to the south of}} the site. Apparently the site is accessible in May, when the woods are opened to the public to view the fine display of bluebells.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the early}} {{industries}} to establish itself in Johnstown was the Knox gelatine plant. It was built in 1890 by Charles B. Knox, a prominent Johnstown resident, who developed the granulated, unflavored gelatin still used in food preparation today. When Knox died in 1908, his wife Rose Knox assumed management of the business. She {{became one of the}} earliest successful American businesswomen. The Knox family and its philanthropic foundation were generous to the city. Results of their philanthropy can still be found there today. They gave the city the block of land known as Knox Field, where the playgrounds, athletic fields, and <b>bridle</b> <b>path</b> are located. Knox Junior High School was named in honor of the family. The Knox Gelatin plant, once a major employer in Johnstown, closed in 1975 following the sale of the company to the Lipton Tea Company.|$|E
50|$|The Byways and Bridleways Trust (BBT) is a {{charitable}} trust that looks after horses' <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> in the UK. It {{was formed in}} 1979 and takes the side of British walkers when footpaths are being threatened.|$|R
50|$|In 1927 the Claremont Stables {{became a}} riding school, {{in part to}} {{encourage}} the employment of the <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> in nearby Central Park. In December 1943, Irwin J. Novograd, a Polish immigrant employed as a bookkeeper for Claremont, purchased the building.|$|R
50|$|There are 13 mi {{of hiking}} trails in Mohican State Park, plus an {{additional}} 32 mi of hiking trails {{in the adjacent}} State Forest. The designated mountain bike trails and <b>bridle</b> <b>paths</b> are also available for the hiker to use.|$|R
