50|$|The lesser <b>broad-bordered</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> or Langmaid's {{yellow underwing}} (Noctua janthina) is a moth {{of the family}} Noctuidae. It is {{distributed}} throughout southern and central Europe, and southern Sweden.|$|E
50|$|Noctua janthe, {{the lesser}} <b>broad-bordered</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> is a moth {{of the family}} Noctuoidea. Some authors {{consider}} Noctua janthe and Noctua janthina {{to be the same}} species. It is found in Europe and North Africa.|$|E

50|$|Viola {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the giant leopard moth, large yellow underwing, lesser <b>broad-bordered</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary, pearl-bordered fritillary, and Setaceous Hebrew character.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Broad-bordered</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> (N. fimbriata) - rare, one on 29 September 1994 {{was a new}} Isles of Scilly record. A {{second was}} caught on 29 September 1995 and a third on 9 July 2001; all on St Agnes.|$|E
50|$|Noctua fimbriata, the <b>broad-bordered</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae. It is found in Europe, North Africa, Anatolia, the Caucasus, Turkey, Caucasus, Transcaucasia, Armenia, Turkmenistan and Novosibirsk Oblast. The border of its {{southern}} range is unclear because of the similar looking species Noctua tirrenica.|$|E
50|$|The lesser <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> (Noctua comes) is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae.|$|R
5000|$|Lesser <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> (N. comes) - common, {{about half}} of {{specimens}} are ab. sagittifer Cockane.|$|R
50|$|Freesias {{are used}} as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Large <b>Yellow</b> <b>Underwing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nettles are the {{exclusive}} larval food plant for {{several species of}} butterflies, such as the peacock butterfly or the small tortoiseshell, and are also eaten by the larvae of some moths including angle shades, buff ermine, dot moth, the flame, the gothic, grey chi, grey pug, lesser <b>broad-bordered</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> mouse moth, setaceous Hebrew character, and small angle shades. The roots are sometimes eaten by the larva of the ghost moth Hepialus humuli.|$|E
50|$|The foliage is {{sometimes}} eaten by the larvae of Lepidoptera, including emperor moth, willow beauty, white-pinion spotted, common emerald, November moth, pale November moth, mottled pug, green pug, brimstone moth, feathered thorn, brown-tail, yellow-tail, short-cloaked moth, lesser yellow underwing, lesser <b>broad-bordered</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> double square-spot, black and brown hairstreaks, hawthorn moth (Scythropia crataegella) and the case-bearer moth Coleophora anatipennella. Dead blackthorn wood provides {{food for the}} caterpillars of the concealer moth Esperia oliviella.|$|E
50|$|Ivies are {{of major}} {{ecological}} importance for their nectar and fruit production, both produced {{at times of}} the year when few other nectar or fruit sources are available. The ivy bee Colletes hederae is completely dependent on ivy flowers, timing its entire life cycle around ivy flowering. The fruit are eaten by a range of birds, including thrushes, blackcaps, and woodpigeons. The leaves are eaten by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera such as angle shades, lesser <b>broad-bordered</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> scalloped hazel, small angle shades, small dusty wave (which feeds exclusively on ivy), swallow-tailed moth and willow beauty.|$|E
50|$|Noctua interjecta, {{the least}} <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> is a moth {{of the family}} Noctuoidea. It is found in Europe.|$|R
50|$|Noctua orbona, {{the lunar}} <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> is a moth {{of the family}} Noctuoidea. It {{is found in the}} Palearctic.|$|R
50|$|Gladioli {{are used}} as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} the Large <b>Yellow</b> <b>Underwing,</b> and gladiolus thrips.|$|R
5000|$|Least <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> (N. interjecta caliginosa) - rare, one on St Agnes (12 August 1994) was {{the first}} Scillonian record since the 1880s.|$|R
50|$|Calendulas {{are used}} as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Cabbage moth, Gothic moth, Large <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> and Setaceous Hebrew character.|$|R
50|$|It {{is smaller}} in size, with clearer plumage pattern: no {{scalloping}} on breast, underparts brighter <b>yellow,</b> <b>underwing</b> lighter. The {{base of the}} maxilla is dark.|$|R
50|$|Rheum {{species have}} been {{recorded}} as larval food plants for some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, buff ermine, cabbage moth, large <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> and nutmeg moth.|$|R
50|$|Larvae of the {{foxglove}} pug, a moth, {{consume the}} flowers {{of the common}} foxglove for food. Other species of Lepidoptera eat the leaves, including the lesser <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing.</b>|$|R
50|$|This species {{generally}} has {{the appearance of}} a smaller (wingspan 38-48 mm) version of the large <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> Noctua pronuba. The forewings are equally variable in pattern and colour, from pale clay to reddish clay, light brown to almost black. The stigmata are dark and outlined with pale yellow. The crosslines are weak. The wavy line flows on to the front edge as a no more than dark brown (never black) stain, which is sometimes extended down the enire wavy line. The hindwings are orange-yellow with a broad black sub-terminal band and central discal lunule (usually absent in Noctua pronuba). It is also similar to the lunar <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> Noctua orbona. In the overall impression a broad-winged species.|$|R
50|$|Catocala nymphagoga, the oak <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> is a moth of the Erebidae family. It {{is found}} in Southern Europe, from Bulgaria up to the Iberian Peninsula and {{sometimes}} further north as a migrant. It {{is also found in}} North Africa and Asia Minor.|$|R
50|$|Dianthus {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Cabbage Moth, Double-striped Pug, Large <b>Yellow</b> <b>Underwing</b> and The Lychnis. Also three species of Coleophora case-bearers feed exclusively on Dianthus; C. dianthi, C. dianthivora and C. musculella (which feeds exclusively on D. superbus).|$|R
50|$|Noctuid moths {{commonly}} {{begin the}} reproductive season from spring to fall, and mostly are multivoltine, {{such as the}} Eastern Panthea moth (Panthea furcilla), which reproduces over the year. Nevertheless, some species have just one brood of offspring (univoltine); among the best known is the Lesser <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> (Noctua comes).|$|R
50|$|The Small Dark <b>Yellow</b> <b>Underwing</b> (Coranarta cordigera) is a moth of the Noctuidae family. It can {{be found}} in parts of Europe, mainly in the North. In Central and Southern Europe it is only found in mountainous areas. In the Alps for instance, it is found up to heights of 2,200 meters.|$|R
50|$|The large <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> (Noctua pronuba) is a moth, {{the type}} species {{for the family}} Noctuidae. It is an {{abundant}} species throughout the Palearctic ecozone, {{one of the most}} common and most familiar moths of the region. In some years the species is highly migratory with large numbers appearing suddenly in marginal parts of the range.|$|R
50|$|Various Allium {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of the leek moth and onion fly {{as well as some}} Lepidoptera {{including}} cabbage moth, common swift moth (recorded on garlic), garden dart moth, large <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> moth, nutmeg moth, setaceous Hebrew character moth, turnip moth and Schinia rosea, a moth that feeds exclusively on Allium species.|$|R
