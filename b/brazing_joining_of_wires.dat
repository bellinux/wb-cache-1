40|$|Recently {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} {{interest}} in research development and commercialization of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Joining and sealing are critical issues that will need to be addressed before SOFCs can truly perform as expected.

40|$|The unusual wetting {{phenomenon}} of liquid Bi on surface-porous copper has been studied. A porous layer was prepared {{at the surface}} of a copper substrate and the wetting behavior of liquid Bi on this layer was investigated and compared with that on a flat solid copper substrate. A surface-oxidized copper substrate was reduced at 473 K in H 2 to prepare a porous layer at the surface. Since the contact angle of liquid Bi on the flat solid copper substrate was gradually declining with increasing temperature, the behavior of liquid Bi on solid copper was shown to have good-wettability. In addition, the unusual wetting behavior of liquid Bi was observed on surface-porous copper substrate. This result is evidence that the pores in the porous layer are 3 -dimensionally inter-connected. This usual wetting {{phenomenon of}} liquid Bi was then applied in the <b>joining</b> <b>of</b> copper <b>wire</b> with the surface-porous copper substrate.

The first phase involved the screening of platinum-base, vanadium-base and vanadium-niobium base <b>brazes</b> for the <b>joining</b> <b>of</b> Cb- 1 Zr or T- 111 alloys to high purity alumina. The second phase involved studies of the performance of sealed capsule samples during 5000 -hour aging tests at 800, 1000, and 1200 C in high vacuum. Sealed capsules which were made using pure vanadium braze, and were brazed at 1850 C for one minute, survived 64 thermal cycles to 1200 C at the heating/cooling rate of 100 C/minute. Vanadium braze samples survived 5000 -hour aging tests at 800, 1000, and 1200 C. One thermally cycled sample survived a subsequent 5000 -hour aging period at 1000 C, but another, at 1200 C, did not survive. It was concluded that a pure vanadium braze used to bond high purity alumina to Cb- 1 Zr alloy is the best of the systems studied, but that additional studies must be performed to establish its service temperature limitations for the desired three to five years' service...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{mechanical}} strength of different joints made by conventional brazing, TIG and laser welding with and without filling material. Five standardized <b>joining</b> configurations <b>of</b> orthodontic <b>wire</b> in spring hard quality were used: round, cross, 3 mm length, 9 mm length and 7 mm to orthodontic band. The joints were made by five different methods: brazing, tungsten inert gas (TIG) and laser welding with and without filling material. For the original orthodontic wire and for each kind of joint configuration or connecting method 10 specimens were carefully produced, totalizing 240. The fracture strengths were measured with a universal testing machine (Zwick 005). Data were analyzed by ANOVA (p= 0. 05) and Bonferroni post hoc test (p= 0. 05). In all cases, brazing joints were ruptured on a low level of fracture strength (186 - 407 N). Significant differences between brazing and TIG or laser welding (p< 0. 05, Bonferroni post hoc test) were found in each joint configuration. The highest fracture strength means were observed for laser welding with filling material and 3 mm joint length (998 N). Using filling materials, there was a clear tendency to higher mean values of fracture strength in TIG and laser welding. However, statistically significant differences were found only in the 9 -mm long joints (p< 0. 05, Bonferroni post hoc test). In conclusion, the fracture strength of welded joints was positively influenced by the additional use of filling material. TIG welding was comparable to laser welding except for the impossibility <b>of</b> <b>joining</b> orthodontic <b>wire</b> with orthodontic band...|$|R
50|$|Brazing is {{a thermal}} joining {{process in which}} two pieces of base metal are joined by a molten brazing filler metal which is drawn between them by {{capillary}} action.

A brazing filler metal has a high melting temperature, which is nevertheless lower than the melting point of the metals being <b>joined.</b> <b>Brazing</b> can <b>join</b> pipes, rods, and metal pieces which fit tightly against each other without large gaps; it can even join tungsten carbide, ceramics, and similar non-metallic materials.|$|R
50|$|Brazed {{hard metal}} joints are {{typically}} two to seven mils thick. The <b>braze</b> alloy <b>joins</b> {{the materials and}} compensates for the difference in their expansion rates. It also provides a cushion between the hard carbide tip and the hard steel, which softens impact and prevents tip loss and damage—much as a vehicle's suspension helps prevent damage to the tires and the vehicle. Finally, the <b>braze</b> alloy <b>joins</b> the other two materials to create a composite structure, much as layers of wood and glue create plywood. The standard for braze joint strength in many industries is a joint that is stronger than either base material, so that when under stress, one or other of the base materials fails before the joint.|$|R
5000|$|The {{meaning of}} the term [...] "mobile" [...] as applied to {{sculpture}} has evolved since it was first suggested by Marcel Duchamp in 1931 to describe the early, mechanized creations of Alexander Calder. [...] At this point, [...] "mobile" [...] was synonymous with the term [...] "kinetic art", describing sculptural works in which motion is a defining property. While motor or crank-driven moving sculptures may have initially prompted it, the word [...] "mobile" [...] later came to refer more specifically to Calder's free-moving creations. Influenced by the abstract work of Piet Mondrian, Joan Miró and Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Calder in many respects invented an art form where objects (typically brightly coloured, abstract shapes fashioned from sheet metal) are connected by wire much like a balance scale. By the sequential attachment of additional objects, the final creation consists of many balanced parts <b>joined</b> by lengths <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> whose individual elements are capable of moving independently or as a whole when prompted by air movement or direct contact. Thus, [...] "mobile" [...] has become a more well-defined term with its origin in the many such hanging constructs Calder produced in a prolific manner between the 1930s until his death in 1976.|$|R

In the experiments of self-producing heat <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> 6 types <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> are used under {{the situation of}} overloading. The {{results show that the}} effect of the temperature rise <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> on insulating property <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> is remarkable. Under the situation of having electric current wired to produce heat by itself, the insulation resistance <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> decreases and the leakage of electricity electric current enhances. Under the situation that electric current is relatively stable, the temperature becomes stable when rising to a certain value, conducting wire heat dissipating and fever heat are in an equilibrium state. In the experiments of external radiation, such as the situation of building fire, RV sheathed wires present a similar regulation to the self-producing heat experiments. The difference is that the effect of external factor (such as air flow, voltaic instability, etc.) on temperature <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> is more obvious than that on the insulation resistance <b>of</b> <b>wire.</b> When external factor makes the wire temperature decrease to a certain value, the insulation resistance value is higher than that out of the effect...|$|R
