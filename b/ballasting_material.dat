40|$|High {{abundance}} of aggregates {{has often been}} related to high primary production and phytoplankton blooms. Especially in shallow and turbid coastal regions the formation of aggregates and their sinking velocities also depends on the interaction between primary produced organic matter and lithogenic particles. Nine roller tank experiments were conducted during spring 2012 in the Northern Wadden Sea (Germany) to determine temporal dynamics of formation, composition, and sinking velocity of aggregates, {{in relation to the}} wax and wane of the phytoplankton bloom. Highest sinking velocities (June-July) did not coincide with highest SPM concentrations (January-March). After the diatom bloom almost 80 % of SPM was rapidly settling in aggregates but only 10 % rapidly settled during the subsequent Phaeocystis bloom. The results suggest interactive effects of particle size, specific density and the availability of organic and inorganic particulate matter.

Separation is inefficient and the unit experiences loss of ballast at 7 to 14 lbs per million gallons of treated water through the overflow of the hydrocyclone. Currently, ballast must be added at the loss rate to maintain the proper concentration to remove TSS. This requires that water treatment plants must provide storage space for <b>ballast</b> <b>material,</b> manpower to add the ballast, and a method to measure ballast concentration. To recover <b>ballast</b> <b>material,</b> a scale model of the overflow of the hydrocyclone was constructed and an angled pipe was added to settle the ballast into a collection sump.

The maximum linear velocity in the settling pipe to settle ballast was also determined and used as the design criteria for the pilot scale.

But the selection of <b>ballast</b> <b>material</b> has appeared to be based on limited information without full regard to the effect of ballast particle characteristics on the ability of ballast to fulfill its functions in track. This will result in some misjudgments in the <b>ballast</b> <b>material</b> selection. ^ The developed model can quantify the ballast suitability with a ballast quality index which has taken the basic ballast particle characteristics and the main ballast field functions into consideration. The basic ballast particle characteristics included are shape, angularity, surface texture, gradation, and specific gravity. The main ballast field functions for track are providing resistance forces, resiliency, void storage, drainage, and facilitating maintenance. The ballast particle characteristics are numerically related to the ballast field functions based on available data from field and laboratory tests on granular materials and some assumptions. Weighting factors are used to represent the relative importance of the basic ballast particle characteristics to each ballast function and then the relative importance of the main ballast functions to the overall ballast field performance. ^ The developed model is evaluated using the ballast field data related to the track performance. The verification results show that the developed ballast quality index can reflect the ballast quality. ...|$|R

40|$|Fecal pellets {{and marine}} snow {{aggregates}} drive the biological carbon pump via sedimentation {{of organic matter}} from the surface ocean to the deep ocean where carbon can be sequestered for hundreds to thousands of years. However, the controlling mechanisms for carbon export from the surface ocean are still unclear. Studies of fecal pellet fluxes and retention have revealed that most pellets are degraded within the surface waters. However, the key degraders are poorly known. We observed copepods (Danish coastal waters) rejecting pellets immediately after capture, in some cases with pellet fragmentation as outcome. Therefore, coprorhexy (pellet fragmentation) seems the main impact by copepods, {{and they are not}} the key degraders. From size fractionation of a plankton community (Öresund, Denmark), we identified large heterotrophic dinoflagellates as major pellet degraders in the upper ocean. In deeper waters bacterial degradation dominates, only limited by pellet residence time, which is hypothesized to be dependent on ballast minerals. Bacterial degradation (laboratory) was independent of <b>ballast</b> <b>material</b> whereas sinking velocity increased with denser diet, leading to < 10 -fold higher pellet carbon flux with coccolithophorid and diatom diets than with flagellate diet. We calculated vertical carbon fluxes from in situ profiles of marine snow and aggregate size-specific abundance measured during a ship cruise off Cape Blanc (Mauritania), using estimated sinking speeds and aggregate masses. Calculated fluxes agreed well with sediment trap data for the same area and period. We estimated carbon consumption from the fluxes and used consumption changes to identify degradation processes at different depths. Calculated copepod abundances needed to remove the majority of carbon in the upper 75 meters were consistent with previous observations. In deeper waters carbon consumption fit measured bacterial degradation rates. Highest degradation rates were in the upper 200 meters and limited by aggregate residence time (sinking speed), which we argue depends on <b>ballast</b> <b>material.</b> We observed high sinking speeds for the aggregates formed on material from Cape Blanc due to presence of liths from coccolithophorids and high input of dust. In laboratory experiments bacterial carbon specific degradation was independent of <b>ballast</b> <b>material</b> whereas sinking speed increased with denser aggregate constituents.

40|$|Ballasted flocculation, {{also known}} as high rate clarification, is a physical-chemical {{treatment}} process that uses continuously recycled media {{and a variety of}} additives to improve the settling properties of suspended solids through improved floc bridging. The objective of this process is to form microfloc particles with a specific gravity of greater than two. Faster floc formation and decreased particle settling time allow clarification to occur up to ten times faster than with conventional clarification, allowing treatment of flows at a significantly higher rate than allowed by traditional unit processes. Ballasted flocculation units function through the addition of a coagulant, such as ferric sulfate; an anionic polymer; and a <b>ballast</b> <b>material</b> such as microsand, a microcarrier, or chemically enhanced sludge. When coupled with chemical addition, this <b>ballast</b> <b>material</b> {{has been shown to be}} effective in reducing coagulation-sedimentation time (Liao, et al., 1999).

Most of the <b>ballast</b> <b>material</b> used in Sri Lanka is obtained from biotite gneiss rock which is available in abundance. However, ballast is constantly subjected to degradation throughout its service due mainly to ballast breakage and migration of fine particles from the subgrade into the ballast layer, which is known as mud pumping.

The study is mainly based on the information gained from a number of studied reference projects. The <b>ballast</b> <b>material</b> removed is, on average, ca 0. 5 m 3 /track metre in ballast cleaning and ca 1 m 3 /track metre in banquette cleaning. The introduction of the Environmental Code resulted in a tightening of requirements with regard to e. g. the way in which this surplus material is to be disposed of.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the origin of “shakedown cruise” comes from the need to settle (or literally shake down) the ballast in the hold of a ship to ensure it is level in the water. However, this would only apply to very granular <b>ballast</b> <b>material</b> such as sand. The term is more likely to have arisen due to the transition from sail to power. The advent of engines within the hull of a ship caused severe vibration. Such vibration would be aggravated by uneven running and different sea conditions.

The resilient moduli of the subgrades were determined from repeated load triaxial tests and site-specific correlations with the standard and Dutch cone penetration tests. ^ A three dimensional, nonlinear, elastic, multilayer model, GEOTRACK, was used to estimate the stresses and deformations in the track foundations. The model was validated by comparing the predicted elastic foundation responses with those measured at FAST. Comparisons of measured and predicted track modulus were also made for the revenue field sites. ^ The inelastic behavior of the soil was investigated using repeated load triaxial tests and a ballast box device for simulating field conditions.

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{comprehensive}} investigation to find to what extent simple laboratory tests e. g. Los Angeles abrasion and micro-Deval might be suitable for predicting real railway ballast performance with respect to deformation and degradation. A number of tests to measure essential properties of ballast aggregate have been performed in addition to advanced material testing. Large cyclic triaxial loading test and full scale railway track model test were employed to simulate the effects of train loading and tamping, and to study settlement, stiffness and degradation {{of a range of}} <b>ballast</b> <b>materials.</b> The testing programme included both wet and dry testing conditions. All the rock types tested were mainly composed of combinations of principal rock-forming silicate minerals. They represent all together a wide variety of igneous, metamorphic and consolidated/metamorphosed sedimentary rocks mainly fine to very fine grained. Mechanical properties Change in the ballast grading proved to affect the ballast breakage development over time. However, the abrasion property expressed by the micro-Deval value did not show any association with the degradation of ballast under repeated load testing. Simulation of repeated tamping seemed to be the main source of ballast breakage. Most rocks showed high frost resistance after long term impact, but samples with high content of amphibole were less frost resistant. The rocks’ mechanical strength in terms of the Los Angeles abrasion or micro-Deval value did not show any correlation with either the amount of microcracks or the rocks’ average mineral grain size. A new method to measure the amount of microcracks based on luminescence measurements was developed. It is suggested that micro-cracks represent open channels for water to penetrate into the aggregate, which was confirmed by good correlation between water absorption and the amount of micro-cracks. Moisture had generally a negative effect on rocks’ mechanical strength according to Los Angeles abrasion and Point Load strength results. On the other hand, dry and wet triaxial tests with cyclic loadings did not confirm this effect. Neither did mineral grain size distribution show any correlation with mechanical strength, but the range of coefficient of conformity (Cu = D 60 /D 10) was probably too narrow to obtain a reliable conclusion. A new method to quantify the mineral grain size distribution was developed under these test series. Functional properties Both resilient modulus of the ballast layer and the stiffness of the track were governed by the materials’ grading curve and specific density. A possible relation between the amount of microcracks in the aggregate and resilient modulus as well as ballast breakage is suggested. The permanent vertical strain during repeated load testing was affected by both the micro-Deval value, the grading curve of the ballast and the aggregate’s content of soft minerals. Improvements of test methods The Los Angeles abrasion test distinguished clearly between the superior quality material and the very poor material. The Los Angeles abrasion value is, however, a poor parameter to indicate how the intermediate material will behave in service regarding ballast breakage. This study proposes to improve the ranking of <b>ballast</b> <b>materials</b> by introducing two additional methods. One which is able to measure some rocks’ ability to recover mechanical strength after repeated crushing, and one which measures the production of fines (0 / 0. 125 mm) during crushing. Saturation of <b>ballast</b> <b>material</b> before micro-Deval testing did not have any significant effect on degradation. Neither did the use of 1 % sodium-chloride solution have any effect.

40|$|AbstractTraffic {{congestion}} of highways in {{many countries}} around the world has led railways to become the most popular means of public transportation, which increased the demand for faster and heavier trains. High- speed trains and heavy train loads are normally accompanied with strong vibrations in the track-ground system, which increases the risk of train derailment and track damages. Therefore, to allow for safer and reliable operation of high-speed trains, an investigation into the behavior of ballasted railway track foundations subjected to train moving loads at various speeds is a subject of prime importance in design of railway tracks. In the current study, sophisticated three dimensional (3 D) finite elements (FE) numerical modelling was developed to investigate the impact of train speed on the dynamic response of track-ground system. In addition, some factors of the track-ground system affecting the critical speed including the modulus and thickness of track subgrade and <b>ballast</b> <b>materials,</b> and amplitude of train loading were investigated. The results were analyzed and presented, and their practical implications were discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a {{numerical}} model capable {{to predict the}} electromagnetic response of railway ballast aggregates under different physical conditions has been calibrated and validated by a simulation-based approach. The ballast model {{is based on the}} main physical and geometrical properties of its constituent material and it is generated by means of a random-sequential absorption (RSA) approach. A finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulator is then employed to calculate the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) signal response to the scenario. The calibration of the model has been performed by taking into account the main physical properties and the grain size characteristics of both the reference <b>ballast</b> <b>material</b> and a fine-grained pollutant material, namely, an A 4 soil type material, according to the AASHTO soil classification. The synthetic GPR response has been generated by using the gprMax freeware simulator. Several scenarios have been considered, which in turn were reproduced in laboratory environment and used for the validation of the model. Promising results have demonstrated the high potential of such approach in characterizing the simulated response of complex coarse-grained heterogeneous materials...|$|R
