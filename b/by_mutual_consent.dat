60|$|The third article {{relates to}} the future of the freed people. It does not oblige, but merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent.

50|$|It was Peter Lombard who {{introduced}} {{the distinction between}} a sponsalia de praesenti and a sponsalia de futuro. While the former, a promise of an immediately effective marriage, created a marriage {{that could not be}} dissolved, the latter concerned only a future marriage and as such was seen as a betrothal dissoluble <b>by</b> the <b>mutual</b> <b>consent</b> of the involved parties. It was presumed that the consummation of marriage included the sponsalia de praesenti and thus rendered the sponsalia de futuro a valid marriage.|$|R
5|$|Ryan John Crowther (born 17 September 1988) is an English semi-professional footballer {{who plays}} for Ashton United as a winger.

5|$|York {{achieved}} three successive wins for {{the first}} time in 2013–14 after beating Northampton 2–0 away, with Bowman and Fletcher scoring in three-second half minutes. Defender John McCombe was signed on a two-and-a-half-year contract following his release from Mansfield, before Clay and Jamal Fyfield left York <b>by</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>consent.</b> Pope returned to York on loan from Charlton for the remainder of the season. York's run of wins ended with a 0–0 draw at home to Bristol Rovers, before their first defeat of the year came after losing 2–0 away to Hartlepool. Preston winger Will Hayhurst, a Republic of Ireland under-21 international, was signed on a one-month loan.

5000|$|In the New South Wales Legislative Council {{election}} in 1937, Labor's group featured four candidates named Amour, Ashley, Armstrong and Arthur—all of the [...] "Four A's" [...] were duly elected. This prompted the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1940, which replaced that ballot paper layout with one {{closer to the}} present layout where the order of candidates' names within each group was determined <b>by</b> those candidates' <b>mutual</b> <b>consent,</b> which in practice means it {{is determined by the}} party organization.|$|R
60|$|As to {{the second}} article, I {{think it would be}} {{impracticable}} to return to bondage the class of persons therein contemplated. Some of them, doubtless, in the property sense belong to loyal owners, and hence provision is made in this article for compensating such. The third article relates {{to the future of the}} freed people. It does not oblige, but merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent. This ought not to be regarded as objectionable on the one hand or on the other, insomuch as it comes to nothing unless <b>by</b> the <b>mutual</b> <b>consent</b> of the people to be deported and the American voters, through their representatives in Congress.|$|R
5|$|Allardyce {{departed}} {{the club}} on in January 2008 <b>by</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>consent</b> after a bad {{start to the}} 2007–08 season, and Kevin Keegan was reappointed as Newcastle manager. Mort stepped down as chairman in June {{and was replaced by}} Derek Llambias, a long-term associate of Ashley. Newcastle finished the 2007–08 season in twelfth place, but as the season drew to a close, Keegan publicly criticised the board, claiming they were not providing the team enough financial support.|$|E
5|$|Having been released, Rhodes {{returned}} to the Conference by joining Oxford United on a free transfer in May 2009.

6000|$|... "Now look here! It's {{time you}} should {{understand}} me and yourself. Three years ago, when our partnership was dissolved <b>by</b> accident, or <b>mutual</b> <b>consent,</b> we will say, we started afresh, each {{on our own}} hook.

50|$|The 1918 Decree on Divorce {{eliminated}} the religious {{marriage and the}} underlying ecclesiastical law, replacing them with civil marriage sanctioned by the state. Divorce was obtained <b>by</b> filing a <b>mutual</b> <b>consent</b> document with the Russian Registry Office, or by the unilateral request of one party to the court. The divorce law under the Bolsheviks did not penalize the husband with alimony, child support, or debtor's prison for non-payment, as every individual was {{to be provided for}} by the state anyway. The two partners were entirely free of legal obligations to each other after divorce.|$|R
60|$|As on {{a former}} occasion, his wife wished {{to speak to}} him alone about the girl's future, the time now drawing nigh at which Reynard was {{expected}} to come and claim her. He would have done so already, but he had been put off by the earnest request of the young woman herself, which accorded with that of her parents, on the score of her youth. Reynard had deferentially submitted to their wishes in this respect, the understanding between them having been that he would not visit her before she was eighteen, except <b>by</b> the <b>mutual</b> <b>consent</b> of all parties. But this could not go on much longer, and there was no doubt, from the tenor of his last letter, that he would soon take possession of her whether or no.|$|R
5|$|His {{last game}} for the club came on 22 August 2015 against Bournemouth. Starting the game, Nolan was {{substituted}} for Matt Jarvis at half-time with his side already 2–0 behind in an eventual 4–3 home loss. Five days later, Nolan left West Ham United <b>by</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>consent</b> after four years at the club. He had played 157 games for West Ham in all competitions, scoring 31 goals.|$|E
5|$|In the past, a Deshastha widow {{was never}} allowed to remarry, while it was {{acceptable}} for Deshastha widowers to remarry, and the widows had to lead a very austere life with little joy. Divorces were non-existent. All of these practices have gradually fallen by the wayside over the last hundred years, and modern Deshastha widows lead better lives and younger widows also remarry. Divorce takes place <b>by</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>consent</b> and legal approval is sought.|$|E
5|$|Myrie-Williams {{rejected}} {{a contract with}} Port Vale to sign a two-year deal with newly promoted League One club Scunthorpe United in June 2014. He went on loan to League Two side Tranmere Rovers in January 2015, after being signed by his former Port Vale boss Micky Adams. Rovers were relegated out of the Football League {{at the end of}} the 2014–15 season, and Myrie-Williams became a free agent in the summer after his contract with Scunthorpe was cancelled <b>by</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>consent.</b>|$|E
50|$|Traian and Profuturus arrived leading {{troops of}} Armenians but Frigeridus, leading the Pannonian and the transalpine auxiliaries, fell ill from gout. Richomeres, having led a force cut from Gratian's palatine army, <b>by</b> the <b>mutual</b> <b>consent</b> {{of the other}} leaders took command of the {{combined}} forces, probably at Marcianople. The Goths withdrew north of the Haemus mountains and the Romans moved to engage. At a place called Ad Salices ("The Willows"), they fought the Battle of the Willows. The Romans were outnumbered and during the battle their left wing began to collapse. Only with hasty reinforcements and Roman discipline was the situation retrieved. The battle lasted until dusk when the opposing armies broke off, the Goths withdrawing into their wall of wagons, leaving the battle a bloody draw. Both sides counted heavy losses, including Profuturus who was slain on the battlefield.|$|R
5000|$|In Japan, diners who are {{strangers to}} each other will {{generally}} be seated together only <b>by</b> their <b>mutual</b> <b>consent.</b> In Canada, advice columnist Mary Beeckman pointed out in 1948 that the head waiter would generally ask a patron before seating a stranger {{at his or her}} table, but that refusal to do so would be regarded as [...] "stuffy and selfish". South Korean McDonald's customers tended to feel awkward asking for permission to sit at a stranger's table, and were more comfortable being conducted to a seat by an employee. Being asked by the waiter to share a table may or not may be a function of party size. For example, in restaurants with tables seating four to six people, a party of two or three may be requested to share a table, as one author pointed out in the context of Belarusian etiquette.|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} past, an {{agreeable}} practice, known since times ever so ancient, by which {{brothers and sisters}} are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another, and in which Pen and his little sister Laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days, had been given up <b>by</b> the <b>mutual</b> <b>consent</b> of those two individuals. Coming back from college after an absence from home of some months, {{in place of the}} simple girl whom he had left behind him, Mr. Arthur found a tall, slim, handsome young lady, to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which {{he had been in the}} habit of administering previously, and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand, and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek, just upon the very spot which young Pen had been used to salute.|$|R
