60|$|The agile, broad-chested lieutenant, {{without a}} change of {{expression}} in his smooth, yellow-brown, melancholy face, shot the <b>belt</b> <b>strap</b> through the guard of the buckle, hefted his sixes in their holsters as a belle gives the finishing touches to her toilette, caught up his Winchester, and dived for the door. There he paused long enough to caution his comrades to maintain their watch upon the bridge, and then plunged into the broiling highway.|$|E
5000|$|Brails, in a sailing ship, {{are small}} lines used {{to haul in}} or up the edges (leeches) or corners of sails, before furling. On a ship rig, these brails are most often found on the mizzen sail. The command is, hale up the brails, or, brail up the sails. The word brail comes from Middle English brayle, from Anglo-French braiel <b>belt,</b> <b>strap,</b> brail, {{alteration}} of Old French braiuel belt, probably ultimately from Latin braca pant.|$|E
50|$|From the PRR station {{during the}} Gettysburg Campaign of the Civil War, Union scout Stephen W. Pomeroy telegraphed the vital news to Governor Andrew Curtin that Robert E. Lee was concentrating the Army of Northern Virginia at Gettysburg. This was how state {{officials}} {{came to know}} of this vital intelligence, which Pomeroy had carried for nearly sixty miles from near Lee's headquarters in Chambersburg. He had sewn the message into his <b>belt</b> <b>strap</b> of his pants.|$|E

5000|$|Beltbags: The beltbag is an {{inflatable}} seat-belt strap that {{is able to}} reduce the risk of injury to passengers in the rear in a head-on collision by lessening the strain placed on the ribcage. Should the crash sensors detect a severe frontal impact, the airbag control unit will trigger deployment and inflation of the beltbag. A gas generator then inflates the multi-layered <b>belt</b> <b>strap</b> with Velcro seams to nearly three times its normal width. The resulting larger surface area is able to better distribute the force acting on the seat occupant, thereby reducing the risk of injury.|$|E
50|$|The daughter's and mother's arms {{represent}} {{the two parts}} of a seat belt. The film was made for a British audience; cars are driven on the left hand {{side of the road}} in the UK and so the positioning of the mother's arms reflects the position of the upper seat <b>belt</b> <b>strap</b> for a driver in the UK. Similarly, the father turns the wheel to the left (the shoulder part of the road in the UK) to avoid the oncoming danger. If the film was shown in mirror image, it would correct these apparent inconsistencies for audiences in those parts of the world where cars are driven on the right hand side.|$|E
50|$|A vehicle-sensitive lock {{is based}} on a {{pendulum}} swung away from its plumb position by rapid deceleration or rollover of the vehicle. In the absence of rapid deceleration or rollover, the reel is unlocked and the <b>belt</b> <b>strap</b> may be pulled from the reel against the spring tension of the reel. The vehicle occupant can move around with relative freedom while the spring tension of the reel keeps the belt taut against the occupant. When the pendulum swings away from its normal plumb position due to sudden deceleration or rollover, a pawl is engaged, the reel locks and the strap restrains the belted occupant in position. Dual-sensing locking retractors use both vehicle G-loading and webbing payout rate to initiate the locking mechanism.|$|E

5000|$|In March 1937, {{under a new}} Tătărescu government, the FR's black {{insignia}} and uniforms were outlawed, alongside {{those of}} other paramilitary movements (including the Guard and the PNC). The party continued to be identified by its main electoral logo, [...] "two concentric circles with a single dot at the center", under which it ran in the local elections of June. Called [...] "target" [...] or [...] "wheel" [...] in party documents, it symbolized Greater Romania as an outside circle, and, within, [...] "the <b>belt</b> <b>strap</b> tightening around The Black Dot, namely the xenophile". According to Gazeta de Transilvania, this symbol was poorly understood by illiterate sympathizers, who mistakenly voted with the PNȚ's circle (which had been intensely popularized by Ioanițescu before his defection). Later that year, with the PNȚ ready to assume power, but depending on the royal prerogative, Carol II ordered it to accept Vaida-Voevod at Internal Affairs, knowing he would be refused, and hoping to alienate the PNȚ's left. Indeed, this situation renewed the tensions within the PNȚ: Armand Călinescu, who had served under Vaida, criticized the party leadership for not sealing {{a deal with the}} FR.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the more common forms of sledding, back country sledding involves four important elements in combination: {{a great amount of}} directional control, flotation, a binding system, and padding. First, back country sleds are made of strong plastic material, with the snow-side surface possessing various grooves and chines for directional control. Second, the plastic construction, with a large amount of snow-side surface area keeps the sled afloat in deeper snow conditions (the same principle behind wider powder skis or snowboards). Though the original runner sleds possessed directional control, their thin runner blades bogged down in anything but icy or thin snow conditions. Disk sleds, on the other hand, possessed floatation but no directional control. Third, modern back country sleds have a binding system, which usually consists of a simple <b>belt</b> <b>strap</b> that attaches to the sides of the sled. With the sledder in the kneeling position, the strap may go over the sledder's thighs or calves before connecting with the strap {{from the other side of}} the sled with some sort of buckling device. Finally, back country sleds have foam pads glued for the sledder to kneel on for shock absorption. One such sled is the Mad River Rocket.|$|E
30|$|The {{soil block}} we {{analysed}} was extracted in the necropolis of Villalfonsina, {{discovered in the}} province of Chieti (Abruzzo, Italy) and probably dating back to the VI-IV century B.C. [22]. It is one among several other blocks excavated in the same and surrounding areas and containing artefacts of very different use (weapons, finely decorated objects, clothing accessories). This block contained a decorative, elegant and wide bronze belt for men, worn by the deceased. It is composed of two engraved buckles and a continuous metal <b>belt</b> <b>strap,</b> perforated on both upper and lower edges to fasten a leather strip.|$|E
50|$|Tablet Weaving (often card weaving in the United States) is a weaving {{technique}} where tablets or {{cards are}} used to create the shed through which the weft is passed. As the materials and tools are relatively cheap and easy to obtain, tablet weaving is popular with hobbyist weavers. Currently most tablet weavers produce narrow work such as <b>belts,</b> <b>straps,</b> or garment trims.|$|R

5|$|Sasuke {{was also}} the most {{difficult}} character for Kishimoto to draw. He felt that his drawings tended to make Sasuke look too old, {{a result of his}} inexperience in drawing younger characters mature beyond their years. Sasuke's hair, originally kept short to save Kishimoto time, slowly grew longer as the series has progressed. Midway through Part I, Kishimoto drew a new costume for Sasuke featuring a number of <b>belts</b> <b>strapped</b> around his arms and legs, but because it took too long to draw, he returned to Sasuke's original costume design. Despite the time and energy Kishimoto spends drawing Sasuke, he has become his favorite character to draw. He ranked Sasuke alongside Sakura in terms of drawing difficulty. In some cases, his superiors even asked Kishimoto to redraw parts of the manga that did not illustrate Sasuke well.|$|R
