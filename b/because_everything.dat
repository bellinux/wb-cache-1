25|$|The fourth item is {{the common}} eastern idea of Maya. Blavatsky states that the entire {{universe}} is called illusion <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> in it is temporary, i.e. has a beginning and an end, and is therefore unreal {{in comparison to the}} eternal changelessness of the One Principle.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally in winter, jams, preserves, and pickles {{are brought}} to the table. Gathering and conserving fruits, mushrooms, and {{vegetables}} for winter has always been popular, but today gathering and conserving is becoming less common <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> can be bought from stores. However, preparing food for winter is still very popular in the countryside.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} epithets has been {{interpreted}} by Wissowa (and his followers) {{as a reflection of}} the agricultural or warring nature of the god, some of which are also in the list of eleven preserved by Augustine. The agricultural ones include Opitulus, Almus, Ruminus, Frugifer, Farreus, Pecunia, Dapalis, Epulo. Augustine gives an explanation of the ones he lists which should reflect Varro's: Opitulus because he brings opem (means, relief) to the needy, Almus because he nourishes everything, Ruminus because he nourishes the living beings by breastfeeding them, Pecunia <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> belongs to him.|$|E

2500|$|After a scene break, we see Alison's father, Colonel Redfern, who {{has come}} to collect her to take {{her back to her}} family home. The playwright allows the Colonel to come across as quite a {{sympathetic}} character, albeit totally {{out of touch with the}} modern world (as he himself admits). [...] "You're hurt <b>because</b> <b>everything's</b> changed", Alison tells him, [...] "and Jimmy's hurt <b>because</b> <b>everything's</b> stayed the same".|$|R

25|$|Van Heijenoort {{was spared}} {{the ordeal of}} McCarthyism <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> he {{published}} in Trotskyist organs appeared under one or other {{of more than a}} dozen pen names. Moreover, Feferman (1993) states that van Heijenoort the logician was quite reticent about his Trotskyist youth, and did not discuss politics. Nevertheless, in the last decade of his life he contributed to the history of the Trotskyist movement by writing the monograph With Trotsky in Exile (1978), editing a volume of Trotsky's correspondence (1980), and advising and working with the archivists at the Houghton Library in Harvard University, which holds many of Trotsky's papers from his years in exile.|$|E
25|$|José Arcadio Buendía's {{second son}} and {{the first person to}} be born in Macondo. He was thought to have premonitions <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> he said came true. He {{represents}} not only a warrior figure but also an artist due to his ability to write poetry and create finely crafted golden fish. During the wars he fathered 17 sons by unknown women, all named Aureliano. Four of them later begin to live in Macondo, and in the span of several weeks all of them but one (including those who chose not to remain in Macondo) are murdered by unknown assassins, before any of them had reached thirty-five years of age.|$|E
25|$|The Turbo name {{alluded to}} the speed of {{compilation}} and of the executables produced. The edit/compile/run cycle was fast compared to other Pascal implementations <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> related to building the program was stored in RAM, {{and because it was}} a one-pass compiler written in assembly language. Compilation was much faster than compilers for other languages (even Borland's own later compilers for C), and other Pascal compilers, and programmer time was also saved since the program could be compiled and run from the IDE. The execution speed of these COM-format programs was a revelation for developers whose only prior experience programming microcomputers was with interpreted BASIC or UCSD Pascal, which compiled to p-code which was then interpreted at runtime.|$|E
5000|$|I had {{to really}} {{research}} {{and get into}} the mind of somebody with a disability like that. So I spent a few days at a home for mentally retarded teens. We just talked and I watched their mannerisms. People have these expectations that mentally retarded children are really crazy, but its not so. Its refreshing to see them <b>because</b> <b>everythings</b> so new to them.|$|R

25|$|A new Latina group, called Soluna, {{had just}} lost a member and {{was looking for a}} replacement. T Lopez quickly auditioned, and was whisked away on tour. T Lopez {{explained}} that touring with Marc Anthony and Enrique Iglesias was a crazy roller coaster ride for her <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> happened so fast. But she had a great time, T Lopez said. Latina group Soluna released their 2002 debut album, For All Time, under the Dreamworks Records label. Paramount and UPN quickly took interest in the group and developed a TV pilot based on their lives, co-starring Mario Lopez & Tony Plana. After filming the pilot, Soluna reconvened for a second album but realized they had grown apart musically. The group said that they wanted it to work so bad that they were forcing it and they finally just gave up and wished each other well in their individual journeys.|$|E
25|$|The German Army {{struggled}} {{to maintain the}} pockets when it did succeed in encircling Soviet formations. Often, the Red Army broke out at night, through gaps. In the day, small groups broke out, avoiding roads and obvious routes. The Luftwaffe failed to interdict because reconnaissance aircraft warned the Soviets. Richthofen developed ad hoc tactics; armed reconnaissance. His commanding officer, Kesselring, ordered Luftflotte 2 to fly armed reconnaissance missions, using bombers and Henschel Hs 123s from LG 2, to suppress the Soviet ground forces being encircled by the Second and Third Panzer Armies. The Red Army eased German operations. They did not trust the radio transmissions, so they used the telephone lines, which had been damaged by air attacks causing chaos in Soviet communications. Dmitriy Pavlov, commander of the Western Front, complained {{that he could not}} locate his units <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> had to be hidden from enemy aviation. But the Red Army's standing instructions to fire with all weapons on close support aircraft caused a rise in German losses. Luftflotte carries out 458 sorties on the 28 June, half that of the 26 June. On 29 June just 290 sorties were flown. The proximity of German forward airfields prevented even more aircraft being lost.|$|E

500|$|Icke's audiences {{consist of}} all ages and {{political}} persuasions, from the far-right Christian Patriots to New Agers. Barkun categorizes Icke as a New Age conspiracist, describing his work as [...] "improvisational millennialism", with an end-of-history scenario involving a final battle between good and evil. Barkun defines improvisional millennialism as an [...] "act of bricolage": <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> is connected in the conspiracist world view, every source can be mined for links.|$|E
500|$|The fashion was {{extremely}} {{important in this}} video <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> was so minimal ... With the choreography, we really focused on hitting all of the accents in the drum beat. What makes this choreography so interesting is that in one instance, it is very staccato and hard... And the next instance; the movement is very smooth {{and there are lots}} of melts with inter-kit movement in the fingers and hands.|$|E
500|$|Fazekas {{called him}} [...] "a comedy guy, {{who plays the}} lab tech who is kind of disgruntled. He feels like, 'You agents, you just look down your nose at the lab techs,' and he’s a thorn in Sousa’s side. He’s so funny <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> he says is {{completely}} earnest, but hilarious. He just annoys everyone ... he also has his little hero moments as well." [...] Butters called Braunger [...] "a great comic addition to our cast." ...|$|E

500|$|... "It wasn't a {{question}} of doing everything differently, although they changed the ending; it was mostly a matter of doing everything wrong. They said the lines...mostly...but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong that they could possibly do. There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> that they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script, and people assume that, if I hated it, then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed {{it in such a}} ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." ...|$|E
500|$|This [...] "70/30 Law" [...] was {{not only}} applied to the visual designs for the film, {{but also for the}} sound effects and music. Sound {{designer}} Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team [...] "scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms" [...] in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to [...] "avoid sounding slick or sci-fi". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> they tried [...] "affected his comedy", and [...] "the {{last thing you want to}} do in a story like this is affect performances".|$|E
500|$|To play Tracy, Witherspoon {{developed}} a distinct speech pattern combining strident intonations with a chipper Midwestern accent. She also worked on clenching her facial muscles {{and maintaining a}} clipped walking pace. [...] "That was just Tracy, it so escapes me how it came out!" [...] she said. [...] "I just imagined how uptight people carry themselves, and they grind their teeth at night and they clench their jaw <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> has to be just perfect." [...] Praising her performance, her co-star Matthew Broderick said, [...] "From the first she knew exactly what she wanted—a very aggressive person in a small and cute package... she comes out very funny and very scary at the same time." ...|$|E

Discussing these failed relationships, Lister commented during an interview in June 2009 that she believed her character was having a break from men in order to sort out her problems: [...] "I think she's {{been in and out}} of so many relationships and her life is at a bit of a juncture; she probably needs to sort her head out, sort her career, knuckle down really and not get bogged down into a relationship <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> takes a backseat when you're in one." ...|$|E
500|$|Taking Back Sunday {{released}} its debut album, Tell All Your Friends, in March 2002 and {{spent most of}} the year and 2003 touring. Guitarist John Nolan left the band, citing exhaustion from touring, and bassist Shaun Cooper followed shortly afterwards. According to vocalist Adam Lazzara, Nolan and Cooper were, [...] "having trouble <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> was happening so fast. Going from being home... to being gone all the time and having your whole life consumed and almost defined by the band that you’re in is a lot to handle." [...] The group briefly considered breaking up. Guitarist Eddie Reyes contacted his friend, Breaking Pangaea frontman Fred Mascherino, who auditioned for Nolan's spot; bassist Matt Rubano, who grew up with drummer Mark O'Connell, then joined the group. They joined {{just in time for the}} band's fall 2003 tour.|$|E
500|$|He {{graduated}} in 1960 {{and became a}} research student in the university's Mond Laboratory on the old Cavendish site, where he was supervised by Brian Pippard. American physicist Philip Anderson, also a future Nobel Prize laureate, {{spent a year in}} Cambridge in 1961–1962, and recalled that having Josephson in a class was [...] "a disconcerting experience for a lecturer, I can assure you, <b>because</b> <b>everything</b> had to be right or he would come up and explain it to me after class." [...] It was during this period, as a PhD student in 1962, that he carried out the research that led to his discovery of the Josephson effect; Cambridge unveiled a plaque on the Mond Building dedicated to the discovery in November 2012. He was elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1962, and obtained his PhD in 1964 for a thesis entitled Non-linear conduction in superconductors.|$|E
