40|$|A Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) is {{composed}} of Mobile Nodes (MNs) without any infrastructure. MNs selforganize to form a network over radio links. Multicast routing {{plays a significant role}} in MANETs. Due to unique characteristics, such as dynamic network topology, limited bandwidth, and limited battery power, routing in MANETs is a particularly challenging task compared to conventional networks. At present, several efficient routing protocols have been proposed for MANETs. Most of these protocols assume a trusted and cooperative environment. However, in the presence of malicious nodes, the network is vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. The success of Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANETs) strongly depends on peopleâ€Ÿs confidence in its security. In large and dense Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork, location-based routing protocols can offer significant performance improvement over topology-based routing protocols. The objective {{of this paper is to}} prevent possible types of routing attacks like <b>backhole,</b> flooding and wormhole attack on location- based geocasting and forwarding (LGF) routing protocol in Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET). However, there are several potential security issues for the development of position-based routing protocols. The routing attacks against location-based geocasting and forwarding is eliminated by Trust based solution and Shamir Secret Key Sharing Scheme. It has been proved that Shamir Secret Key Sharing Scheme is best solution compared with trust based solution on the metrics packet delivery ratio, control overhead and total overhead...|$|E
