In many countries a red flag is flown to signify that an outdoor shooting range is in use. The United States Air Force refers to its largest annual exercise as red flag operation. Red flags are used for various signals in team sailing races (see Racing Rules of Sailing). A red flag warning is a signal of high wildfire danger and a red flag on the beach warns of dangerous water conditions (double red flags indicate <b>beach</b> <b>closure).</b> Red flags of various designs indicate dangerous wind and wave conditions for mariners.

Temporary Beach Closures, comprized of a 50 x 25 m exclusion zone around a shorebird nest, represent a promising technique for altering human behaviour by reducing both disturbance to birds and inadvertent crushing of eggs by beach visitors. We assessed whether three commonly employed configurations of Temporary Beach Closures (sign, fence, and warden) were effective at: (1) achieving compliance among beach visitors, and (2) reducing egg-crushing rates. Overall, 93. 7 % of beach visitors complied with all Temporary Beach Closures, {{resulting in a}} reduction in egg-crushing rates within, as opposed to adjacent to, Temporary Beach Closures. Levels of compliance were high in all Temporary <b>Beach</b> <b>Closure</b> configurations (88. 0 - 99. 4 %), and similar levels of compliance were achieved within the three configurations. Human compliance was highest for females and when the density of beach-users was higher, while individuals aged 61 years {{were less likely to}} comply with Temporary Beach Closures. Despite an increased probability of compliance on high density beaches, this did not translate into a reduction in egg crushing rates on such beaches, because the overall number of noncompliant individuals remained higher. We conclude any Temporary <b>Beach</b> <b>Closure</b> configuration is meritorious, and that their use on high and low-use recreational beaches will benefit breeding shorebirds by reducing the rate of egg-crushing.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impact on beach {{attendance}} of <b>beach</b> <b>closures</b> and the intersite and intertemporal substitution that may follow <b>beach</b> <b>closures.</b> A model of beach attendance is developed that builds on a model constructed by Paul Ruud to support the State of California's claim to damages after the American Trader oil spill {{off the coast of}} Orange County, southern California. Newly gathered data on <b>beach</b> <b>closures</b> is combined with data on daily attendance from 1985 - 1993. Variables are constructed to test for intersite substitution (the shifting of beach recreation in space, i. e. from a closed beach to another beach) and intertemporal substitution (the shifting of demand for recreation at a particular beach over time). The method of non-linear least squares is used to estimate a system of five seemingly unrelated regression equations. For each equation, Breush-Pagan tests for heteroskedasticity fail to reject the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity and modified Breush-Godfrey tests for autocorrelation fail to reject the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation. The analysis produces only weak evidence to support rejection of null hypotheses that there are no effects due to <b>beach</b> <b>closures,</b> intertemporal substitution, or intersite substitution. For example, just two of six coefficients on closure variables are statistically significant. The lack of stronger evidence of casual effects likely reflects at least in part the fact that (1) the attendance data that form the foundation for analysis only extend from December to March and (2) people can still visit the beach when it is "closed" since the closures considered here pertain only to water contact. Such closures will likely have a greater effect during summer when air and water temperatures are higher and more people will want to engage in water-based recreation...|$|R

40|$|In Southern California, {{terrestrial}} runoff pollution often drains {{directly onto}} the beach, degrading water quality and leading to increased <b>beach</b> <b>closures</b> each year. <b>Beaches</b> are a significant piston in California’s economic engine and <b>beach</b> <b>closures</b> can have significant economic impact on local communities.

Illness rates were calculated by applying previously reported relationships between enterococcus density and HCGI risk to the exposure data. Peak enterococcus concentrations occurred in late winter and early spring, but model results showed that most HCGI cases occurred during summer, attributable to elevated number of exposures. Approximately 99 % of the 95, 010 illness cases occurred when beaches were open. Model runs were insensitive to 0 – 10 % swimming activity assumed during <b>beach</b> <b>closure</b> days. Comparable illness rates resulted under clustered and uniform bather distribution scenarios. HCGI attack rates were within federal guidelines of tolerable risk when averaged over the study period. However, tolerable risk thresholds were exceeded for 27 total days and periods of at least 6 consecutive days.

40|$|As {{summer months}} approach, {{excitement}} for the warm sun and water trigger families to solidify {{plans for a}} trip to the beach. Parents worry about packing for the kids, affording travel expenses, finding lodging, and making sure there is enough sunscreen for everyone. Does anyone ever worry about the condition of the ocean water they will be swimming in? In America, the Environmental Protection Agency monitors the health of coastal recreational waters and has the authority to close beaches that do not meet their safety standards. Bodies of water may contain pathogenic bacteria, protozoa, and viruses found in animal waste. These fecal pathogens contaminate our waterways through coastal and shoreline development, wastewater collection and treatment facilities, septic tanks, urban runoff, disposal of human waste from boats, bathers themselves, animal feeding operations, and natural animal sources like wildlife. Humans that swim in these infected waters risk diseases as mild as ear infections and sore throats, to more serious diseases such as dysentery, typhoid fever, and Hepatitis A. However, instead of testing for a variety of diseases, the EPA uses indicator organisms, E. coli and enterococci, to monitor fecal contamination in coastal recreational waters. If E. coli counts in freshwater rise above 126 organisms per 100 ml or if Enterococci counts in saltwater rise above 35 organisms per 100 ml, a sign posting or <b>beach</b> <b>closure</b> is necessary. E. coli and Enterococci, referred to as indicator organisms or fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), are two of the many organisms that live in the intestinal tracks of mammals and birds. Everyday one human will pass approximately 100 billion to 10 trillion individual E. coli bacteria in their feces. These indicators do not normally harm humans. However, {{there has been a lot}} of press about E. coli infecting the public through food. This particular strain of E. coli, E. coli 0157 :H 7, is a rare but dangerous strain which causes hemorrhaging in the intestines. Because these indicators are relied on so heavily to determine safety of water, it is imperative to determine if these are suitable indicators, understand the environmental factors that allow them to thrive, and ways to eliminate them from the waters. Some of these factors include temperature, light, salinity, rainfall, predation, available nutrients and environmental pollutants...|$|E
40|$|The Pacific/North American plate {{boundary}} is undergoing predominantly right-lateral strike–slip motion along the Queen Charlotte and Fairweather transform faults. The Queen Charlotte Fault (QCF) hosted the largest historical earthquake in Canada, the 1949 M_S 8. 1 strike–slip earthquake, which ruptured from offshore northern Haida Gwaii several hundred kilometers northwestward. On January 5, 2013 an M_w 7. 5 strike–slip faulting event occurred near {{the northern end}} of the 1949 rupture zone. Along central and southern Haida Gwaii the relative plate motion has ∼ 20 % oblique convergence across the left-stepping {{plate boundary}}. There had been uncertainty in how the compressional component of plate motion is accommodated. The October 28, 2012 M_w 7. 8 Haida Gwaii earthquake involved slightly (∼ 20 °) oblique thrust faulting on a shallow (∼ 18. 5 °) northeast-dipping fault plane with strike (∼ 320 °) parallel to the QCF, consistent with prior inferences of Pacific Plate underthrusting beneath Haida Gwaii. The rupture extended to shallow depth offshore of Moresby Island beneath a 25 – 30 km wide terrace of sediments that has accumulated in a wedge seaward of the QCF. The shallow thrusting caused seafloor uplift that generated substantial localized tsunami run-up and a modest far-field tsunami that spread across the northern Pacific, prompting a tsunami warning, <b>beach</b> <b>closure,</b> and coastal evacuation in Hawaii, although ultimately tide gauges showed less than 0. 8 m of water level increase. The mainshock rupture appears to have spread with a ∼ 2. 3 km/s rupture velocity over a length of ∼ 150 km, with slip averaging 3. 3 m concentrated beneath the sedimentary wedge. The event was followed by a substantial aftershock sequence, in which almost all of the larger events involve distributed intraplate normal faulting extending ∼ 50 km oceanward from the QCF. The highly oblique slip partitioning in southern Haida Gwaii is distinctive in that the local plate boundary-parallel motion on the QCF may be accommodated either by infrequent large strike–slip ruptures or by aseismic creep, as {{seems to be the case}} for deeper oblique relative plate motion beneath Haida Gwaii, while the sedimentary terrace accumulates plate boundary-perpendicular compressional strain that releases in almost pure thrust faulting earthquakes, seaward of the QCF...|$|E

40|$|A <b>beach</b> <b>closure</b> {{during the}} height of the summer can cost a coastal {{community}} approximately $ 37, 000. In 2006, 349 beach closures in Rhode Island were due to presumed human fecal contamination. Fecal contamination is determined based on enumeration of fecal indicator bacteria. Fecal enterococci (FE) are the commonly used indicator bacteria for human fecal contamination in fresh and coastal waters. The EPA has suggested that FE is the best indicator of human health risk in salt water used for recreation and shell fishing activities. Recently, molecular analysis of Bifidobacterium adolescentis has been introduced as a more reliable, specific indicator of human fecal contamination. To be useful, bacterial indicators must die soon after entering a water body, so that their presence can be related to a specific contamination event. Some studies have suggested that FE may survive for long periods after entering receiving waters. We assessed the potential role of subaqueous soils and eelgrass (Zostera marina) as refugia for B. adolescentis and FE in a coastal marine environment. Subaqueous soils are mineral soils that exist in shallow water and support rooted vegetation. Eelgrass is a submerged aquatic plant in the shallow water areas of Narragansett Bay. It provides critical habitat for fish, shellfish and crustaceans and conservation concerns have arisen in the past few years due to its marked decline. The study was conducted in Bluff Hill Cove, Point Judith, Rhode Island. Subaqueous soil samples were extracted using a vibracore and eelgrass sampled from the soil extraction sites. FE was analyzed using the Enterolert method and B. adolescentis was detected using nucleic acid analysis. Particle size distribution of each sample was determined to assess relationships between FE and B. adolescentisn concentration and soil texture. FE were present in both the eelgrass and subaqueous soil samples, with a higher concentration found in the latter. By contrast, B. adolescentis was not detected in either soil or eelgrass samples. These results suggest that FE bacteria may not be a reliable indicator of recent human fecal contamination, since soil and plants both appear to serve as refuge for these organisms in coastal environments, and thus a potential source of these bacteria to the water column. Re-evaluation of FE bacteria as an indicator of human fecal contamination in coastal wasters appears to be warranted...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses {{a finite}} mixture logit (FML) model to {{investigate}} the heterogeneity of preferences of beach users for water quality at beaches in Southern California. The results are compared with conventional approaches based conditional logit (CL) and random parameters logit (RPL). The FML approach captures variation in preferences by modeling individual recreator choices using a mixture of several distinct preference groups, where group membership {{is a function of}} individual characteristic and seasonal variables. The FML parameter estimates are used to calculate welfare measures for improvements in beach quality through a reduction of water pollution. The FML segment specific welfare measures bound the traditional CL and RPL mean welfare estimates, and have the advantage of highlighting the distribution of the population sample’s preferences. Analysis of beach recreation site choice data indicates the existence of four representative preference groups within the survey respondent sample. As a result, willingness to pay measures for improvements in water quality and other beach site attribute changes can be weighted across individuals to calculate the distribution of individual welfare measures. One group of recreators is characterized as people who go to the beach and engage in water recreation with children. An interesting finding is that this group has a lower meanWTP for improving water quality than groups who go without children. This may well be an example of cognitive dissonance: parents find they go to the beach more often than others who don’t have children, since that keeps the children occupied and happy, and they adapt their perception of the water quality to be consistent with their behavior. Previous environmental and resource economic applications of the FML have been limited to applications with small choice sets (6) and group membership variables (4). This paper extends the FML model through the estimation of a large (51) choice set with 9 membership variables. This application is the first to incorporate seasonal variables into the group membership function to capture seasonal heterogeneity. Estimated welfare changes are calculated using the compensating variation measure for several hypothetical <b>beach</b> <b>closure</b> and water quality degradation scenarios. Estimation results indicate that the FML welfare estimates differ from those calculated using the traditional logit or RPL models. The FML model sheds light onto which subsets of beach recreators are likely to be impacted by different scenarios of resource change...|$|E
40|$|Beaches are {{of immense}} recreational, {{societal}} and economic value. This value, however, is considerably diminished by poor water quality. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are measured at recreational beaches worldwide {{to assess the}} water quality. A <b>beach</b> <b>closure</b> or advisory is issued if FIB concentrations in surface water exceed recreational water quality standards. Due to the lengthy time required to enumerate FIB (24 – 96 hours), statistical and mechanistic models {{have been developed to}} predict water quality exceedances a priori and to better understand why and under what conditions water quality exceedances occur. These models as well as beach water quality management strategies are often based on limited mechanistic understanding of the fate and transport of FIB in the beach environment. For instance, FIB are known to accumulate at very high concentrations in foreshore sand and porewater at beaches (herein referred to as the foreshore reservoir). The dynamics of FIB accumulation in the foreshore reservoir and its subsequent release, including the impact on surface water quality exceedances, is unknown. It is also unclear how to best quantify the abundance of FIB in the reservoir including its partitioning between the sand and pore water. An increased understanding of the behavior of FIB at beaches is needed to improve the accuracy of predictive water quality models, develop effective measures to reduce water quality exceedances, improve water quality monitoring strategies, and ultimately to better protect human health at recreational beaches. This thesis focuses on addressing key knowledge gaps regarding the behavior and quantification of FIB in the foreshore reservoir. In the first study, seasonal and daily variabilities in FIB concentrations in the foreshore reservoir and surface water are evaluated including determining the influence of environmental factors, such as temperature, waves, and rainfall. In this study, seasonal variability in FIB concentrations in the surface water and foreshore reservoir were found to depend on environmental factors, with some beaches showing a gradual increasing trend through the summer, then decreasing towards the beginning of fall. However, daily variation showed that FIB variability is much more complex and FIB may not simply accumulate over the summer months as previously thought. Further, this study showed {{for the first time that}} FIB may be able to replicate in unseeded natural foreshore beach sand not subjected to external stimuli. The second study uses experimental and field data to evaluate the behavior of FIB in the beach environment during intensified wave conditions including the transfer of FIB from the foreshore reservoir to the surface water. This study showed that as wave height increased foreshore sand erosion resulted in elevated E. coli concentrations in surface water, as well as depletion of E. coli from the foreshore sand and pore water. E. coli initially attached to foreshore sand rather than initially residing in the pore water was found to be the main contributor to elevated surface water concentrations. Surface water E. coli concentrations were a function of not only wave height (and associated sand erosion) but also the time elapsed since a preceding period of high wave intensity. This finding is important for statistical regression models used to predict beach advisories. While calculations suggested that foreshore sand erosion may be the dominant mechanism for releasing E. coli to surface water during intensified wave conditions at a fine sand beach, comparative characterization of the E. coli distribution at a coarse sand-cobble beach suggested that interstitial pore water flow and discharge may be more important for coarser sand beaches. The third study compared the partitioning of FIB in the foreshore reservoir between the sand and pore water and evaluated different sampling methods for quantifying FIB in the foreshore reservoir at beaches with varying grain sizes. This study showed that the collection of the top 1 cm of unsaturated sand resulted in higher and more variable concentrations than the top 5 cm of sand. There were no statistical differences in E. coli concentrations when using different methods to sample the saturated sand. Overall, the unsaturated sand had the highest amount of E. coli when compared to saturated sand and pore water (considered on a bulk volumetric basis). Pore water sampled with a shovel resulted in the highest observed E. coli concentrations (only statistically significant at fine sand beaches) and lowest variability compared to other sampling methods. These findings presented will help determine the appropriate sampling strategy for characterizing FIB abundance in the foreshore reservoir as a means of predicting its potential impact on nearshore surface water quality and public health risk. Overall, this thesis presents valuable information to health departments, beach managers, and scientists interested in improving water quality and water quality predictions at recreational beaches. Findings from this thesis increase understanding of FIB behavior, especially in the foreshore reservoir, and can be used to improve predictive water quality models, develop strategies to reduce FIB levels at beaches, and identify where and when a foreshore reservoir may be an important source of FIB to the surface water at a beach...|$|E

The plan has been implemented since 1989 and is supposed to curtail floatable debris wash-ups by intercepting debris slicks within the Harbor. With this plan, the extent of <b>beach</b> <b>closures</b> declined from over 70 mi in 1988 to fewer than 4 mi in 1989, and closures have remained at a low level in later years. The Short-term Floatables Action Plan has four key elements: ...|$|R

Additional human impacts include <b>beach</b> <b>closures,</b> swimming restrictions and prohibition of the consumption of certain aquatic animals (particularly certain molluscs) after overflow events. Ecological consequences include fish kills, harm to plankton and other aquatic microflora and microfauna. Turbidity increase and dissolved oxygen decrease in receiving waters can lead to accentuated effects beyond the obvious pathogenic induced damage to aquatic ecosystems. It is possible that higher life forms such as marine mammals can be affected since certain seals and sea lions are known to experience peaks in pathogenic harm.|$|R
