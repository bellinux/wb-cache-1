The first step is weaning, when the morphology of calves and the known qualities of their parents are used to make an initial {{selection of}} animals that receive the qualification Reproductive Hope (in French Reproducteur Espoir, abbreviated to Espoir). Annually in excess of about 700 bull calves are then selected to enter the national evaluation station at , close {{to the city of}} Limoges in central France, just after weaning, when they are about seven months old. At Lanaud the animals are grouped together to compare their performance under identical feeding and environmental conditions to the age of 13–14 months. The differences observed between the animals are then related principally to their genetics, which is of interest to breeders <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> is transmitted to a bull's progeny.|$|E

[...] (The Chinese character [...] means [...] "hallux, big toe".) The Ciyuan disputed this: [...] The meaning of the word Jiaozhi cannot be understood literally, but the ancient Greek method of [...] "opposite pillar" [...] and [...] "connecting pillar" [...] to label humans on earth—where [...] "opposite pillar" [...] stood for the South side and its logical opposite the North side, whilst [...] "connecting pillar" [...] stood for the East side with the West side connected to it—could provide a suggested origin. If Jiaozhi was intended to characterize [...] "opposite pillar" [...] <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> people of the North called the people of the South, then the feet of the North side (...) and feet of the South side (...) must oppose each other, therefore rendering it impossible for the feet of a person to cross or intersect each other (...)

30|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} this kind of morality, we will experience difficulties if {{we are committed to}} general and absolute norms that are valid for everybody at all times, norms that say each person has to respond to his/her responsibilities by orienting his/her behavior according to rules of conduct in agreement with these norms. In the wayang, we see that every group - the gods, the brahmans, the warriors, the servants, and others – has its own norms. In addition, every individual, whether he be Bima, Kresna, Karna, Bisma, Destarata or Sengkuni, has his or her own duties that have been determined by the gods.
