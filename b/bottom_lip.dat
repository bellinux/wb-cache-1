This {{was the second}} iteration of the modified rear-wheel-drive platform developed by MG Rover and already receiving plaudits from the media. The car also boasted a new grille stretching down from the bonnet shut-line to the <b>bottom</b> <b>lip</b> of the bumper—a style that had also just appeared on Audi's A6, which {{was not lost on}} the press.|$|E
25|$|Chewing {{tobacco is}} the oldest way of {{consuming}} tobacco leaves. It is consumed orally, in two forms: through sweetened strands, or in a shredded form. When consuming the long, sweetened strands, the tobacco is lightly chewed and compacted into a ball. When consuming the shredded tobacco, small amounts are placed at the <b>bottom</b> <b>lip,</b> between the gum and the teeth, where it is gently compacted, thus it can often be called dipping tobacco. Both methods stimulate the salivary glands, {{which led to the}} development of the spittoon.|$|E
25|$|Her {{battered}} {{body was}} found 18 March 2004, in a rolled-up carpet {{on the grounds of}} Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire. It weighed only six stone (84 lb or 36kg), and was covered with burns and bruises. There were a total of 60 separate injuries. Her ear was scarred and swollen, had split in half, and become infected; her mouth was injured so much that her <b>bottom</b> <b>lip</b> had detached. She had eleven broken ribs. The ultimate cause of death had been thrombosis from a blood clot in her brain, brought on by septicaemia, dehydration and repeated assaults. The injuries were such that police at first thought they had found the body of a young boy. Police took weeks to identify her, launching an appeal on the BBC TV programme Crimewatch and consulting Interpol. She was 20 years old.|$|E

2500|$|Foreman's title {{challenge}} against Moorer {{took place}} on November 5 in Las Vegas, Nevada, with Foreman wearing the same red trunks he had worn in his title loss to Ali 20 years earlier. This time, however, Foreman was a substantial underdog. For nine rounds, Moorer easily outboxed him, hitting and moving away, while Foreman chugged forward, seemingly unable to [...] "pull the trigger" [...] on his punches. Entering the tenth round, Foreman was trailing on all scorecards. However, Foreman launched a comeback in the tenth round and hit Moorer {{with a number of}} punches. Then a short right hand caught Moorer on the tip of his chin, gashing open his <b>bottom</b> <b>lip</b> and he collapsed to the canvas. He lay flat on the canvas as the referee counted him out.|$|E
2500|$|In {{its most}} basic form, a flute is an open tube which is blown into. After focused study and training, players use {{controlled}} air-direction to create an airstream in which the air is aimed downward into the tone hole of the flute's headjoint. There are several broad classes of flutes. With most flutes, the musician blows directly across {{the edge of the}} mouthpiece, with 1/4 of their <b>bottom</b> <b>lip</b> covering the embouchure hole. However, some flutes, such as the whistle, gemshorn, flageolet, recorder, tin whistle, tonette, fujara, and ocarina have a duct that directs the air onto the edge (an arrangement that is termed a [...] "fipple"). These are known as fipple flutes. The fipple gives the instrument a distinct timbre which is different from non-fipple flutes and makes the instrument easier to play, but takes a degree of control away from the musician.|$|E
2500|$|Coloured Balls' second album, Heavy Metal Kid {{spawned the}} Top40 hit, [...] "Love You Babe" [...] in June 1974. Along with Thorpe, Madder Lake, Buster Brown and Chain, they were {{supported}} by suburban-based sharpie gangs. Coloured Balls had fully adopted the Melbourne 1970s sharpies' culture which included wearing chisel toed shoes, jeans, tight-fitting cardigans (expensive hand-made designs by Conti or Stag), crew-cut hair style with 'rats' tails' and most sported tattoos with a spider's web on the neck being popular. Their music was influenced by U.S. bands, MC5 and The Flamin' Groovies. Pubs and town halls became battlegrounds between rival sharpie gangs. Available venues became rare and media reports accused Loyde of encouraging the violence of some sharpies. Nick Ellenford, {{a member of the}} Heidelberg sharps, recalled [...] " [...] played with a cigarette stuck permanently to his <b>bottom</b> <b>lip</b> and always appeared to be drunk or stoned ... he casually walked behind a speaker midsong, threw up, then returned {{to the front of the}} stage without missing a beat". Coloured Balls disbanded at the end of 1974 and Loyde returned to solo work.|$|E

40|$|During the {{starting}} transient of {{a note on}} a brass instrument it can take several cycles of lip vibration before acoustics reflections {{from the end of}} the instrument can influence the lip frequency. Under certain conditions the lip may fail to oscillate at the pitch of the air column resulting in an unwanted pulse-like waveform with relatively low repetition rates (similar to the vocal fry register of phonation in the human voice). This is often observed in the playing of beginners if the lips are insufficiently tense or if the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>lips</b> overlap to a large extent. In this study the reasons for this behavior will be investigated using modeling techniques with the aim of improving the agreement between physical models and measured transients by including the forces responsible for this effect.

2500|$|Some {{time after}} {{getting up and}} being {{attended}} to again by the aforementioned personnel, TV cameras showed a lingering shot of Foley smiling through his profusely bleeding mouth and lips, with a loose tooth hanging beneath his nose; the tooth having been knocked out due to being struck by the chair which had fallen through the cage and landed on his face, dislocating his jaw. Foley was actually trying to show {{a hole in his}} <b>bottom</b> <b>lip</b> by sticking his tongue through it, but it could not be seen clearly through his beard. The match continued for a while longer, ending with Foley receiving the Tombstone Piledriver after being slammed by The Undertaker onto hundreds of thumbtacks, which Foley himself had strewn onto the ring canvas. Although Foley lost, both wrestlers received a standing ovation for the match, and the event is often said to have jump-started Foley's main event career (Foley has said that although this match grew in legend, the reality was that his career remained [...] "somewhat sluggish" [...] for sometime afterwards until Foley further developed the Mankind character, and fans began to catch on). Many future matches attempted to replicate some of the spots from this match. In his autobiography Have a Nice Day! A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks, Foley wrote that he could not remember much of what happened, and he had to watch a tape of the match to write about it. The match was voted Pro Wrestling Illustrateds Match of the Year for 1998. Although many fans regard the match as a classic, it has generated controversy as well. Critics charge that the falls in the match were so extreme and they set the bar for further bumps so high that the inevitable attempts to equal or surpass them would be very dangerous for any wrestlers involved.|$|E

5000|$|Callet's {{method of}} brass embouchure {{consists}} of the tongue remaining forward and through the teeth at all times. The corners of the mouth always remain relaxed, and {{only a small amount}} of air is used. The top and <b>bottom</b> <b>lips</b> curl inward and grip the forward tongue. The tongue will force the teeth, and subsequently the throat, wide open, supposedly resulting in a bigger, more open sound. The forward tongue resists the pressure of the mouthpiece, controls the flow of air for lower and higher notes, and protects the lips and teeth from damage or injury from mouthpiece pressure. Because {{of the importance of the}} tongue in this method many refer to this as a [...] "tongue-controlled embouchure". This technique facilitates the use of a smaller mouthpiece, and larger bore instruments. It results in improved intonation and stronger harmonically related partials across the player's range.|$|R

[...] The Guardians Michael Hann stated that song's [...] "pulsing synths and electronic percussion manage to sound both jackbooted and ineffably melancholy." [...] Jer Fairall wrote for PopMatters that [...] "he aggressive stun-gun rhythm of 'Dancing on My Own' can't hide a classic drama-played-out-on-the-dancefloor scenario inherited from standard bearers like ABBA's 'Dancing Queen' and Madonna's 'Into the Groove', nor is it cold enough not to melt at the touch of Robyn's warm, yearning vocals or the song's shimmering keyboard chime."

50|$|Males have {{a broader}} head than females do. Males may have longer {{extensions}} of their <b>bottom</b> <b>lips.</b> Females have smaller heads and their ovipositor (egg tube) may protrude slightly from their vent. Females'ovaries {{might also be}} visible via spotlighting. One might mistake similar species {{that would be the}} unimaculata complex members. Gladiator is a paternal mouthbrooder and the male should incubate from 12 to 18 days with 14 days being very consistent. Incubation time can vary with water temperature. Females normally initiate spawning. Eggs and milt are released in small batches during an ‘embrace’ typical of osphronemids in which the male wraps his body around that of the female, and there may be several ’dummy’ attempts before spawning commences. Both adults have been observed to collect fertilized eggs. Once the male has all the eggs in his mouth, the cycle is repeated until the female is spent of eggs, a process which can take some time.After spawning, {{it is very important to}} give the male as much peace and quiet as possible. Males of this species are notorious for swallowing broods of eggs after a few days, and the chances of this happening increase if the male is unduly disturbed. The incubation period appears to be capable of varying tremendously with reports suggesting a range of 14 - 35 days at the end of which the male will begin to release fully formed, free-swimming fry.|$|R

40|$|To date, {{the method}} for astronauts to drink liquids in {{microgravity}} or weightless environments is to suck the liquid from a bag or pouch through a straw. A new beverage cup works in microgravity and allows astronauts to drink liquids from a cup {{in a manner}} consistent with that on Earth. The cup is capable of holding beverages with an angled channel running along the wall from the <b>bottom</b> to the <b>lip.</b> In microgravity, a beverage is placed into the cup using the galley dispenser. The angled channel acts as an open passage that contains only two sides where capillary forces move the liquid along the channel until it reaches the top lip where the forces reach an equilibrium and the flow stops. When one sips the liquid at the lip of the channel, the capillary force equilibrium is upset and more liquid flows to the lip from the reservoir at the bottom to re-establish the equilibrium. This sipping process can continue until the total liquid contents of the cup is consumed, leaving only a few residual drops about the same quantity as in a ceramic cup when it is drunk dry on Earth...|$|R
40|$|The F/A- 18 A {{aircraft}} {{has experienced}} engine stalls at high angles-of-attack and yaw flight conditions which were outside of its flight envelope. Future aircraft may {{be designed to}} operate routinely in this flight regime. Therefore, {{it is essential that}} an understanding of the inlet flow field at these flight conditions be obtained. Due to the complex interactions of the fuselage and inlet flow fields, a study of the flow within the inlet must also include external effects. Full Navier-Stokes (FNS) calculations on the F/A- 18 A High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) inlet for several angles-of-attack with sideslip and free stream Mach numbers have been obtained. The predicted forebody/fuselage surface static pressures agreed well with flight data. The surface static pressures along the inlet lip are in good agreement with the numerical predictions. The major departure in agreement is along the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>lip</b> at 30 deg and 60 deg angle-of-attack where a possible streamwise flow separation is not being predicted by the code. The circumferential pressure distributions at the engine face are in very good agreement with the numerical results. The variation in surface static pressure in the circumferential direction is very small with the exception of 60 angle-of-attack. Although the simulation does not include the effect of the engine, it appears that this omission has a second order effect on the circumferential pressure distribution. An examination of the unsteady flight test data base has shown that the secondary vortex migrates a significant distance with time. In fact, the extent of this migration increases with angle-of-attack with increasing levels of distortion. The effects of the engine on this vortex movement is unknown. This implies that the level of flow unsteadiness increases with increasing distortion. Since the computational results represent an asymptotic solution driven by steady boundary conditions, these numerical results may represent an arbitrary point in time. A comparison of the predicted total pressure contours with flight data indicates that the numerical results are within the excursion range of the unsteady data which is the best the calculations can attain unless an unsteady simulation is performed...|$|R
