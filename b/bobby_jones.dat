5|$|Because {{the tournament}} was {{established}} by an amateur champion, <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones,</b> the Masters {{has a tradition of}} honoring amateur golf. It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world.

50|$|In 1930, Compston nearly derailed <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones's</b> {{bid for the}} Grand Slam at Hoylake - {{his third}} round of 68 took the lead from Jones, but inexplicably his form deserted him in the final round, and Compston shot 82 to finish down the field.|$|R
50|$|The {{signature}} hole, however, {{remains the}} par 3 16th, which, legend has it, served as <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones's</b> {{inspiration for the}} 12th hole at Augusta National Golf Club. From one of three tee boxes, the hole plays to a very long, narrow green with three distinct levels that is guarded completely along the front by a large pond. Complicating matters are two pot bunkers, one {{in front of the}} green and one behind. The hole has been consistently rated {{among the best in the}} area, and was ranked by Washingtonian magazine locally.|$|R
5000|$|Sarazen had {{previously}} struggled with his sand play {{and there had}} been earlier sand-specific clubs. But <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones's</b> sand club, for example, had a [...] face, which actually contacted the ball twice during a swing; this design was later banned. Sarazen's innovation was to weld solder onto the lower back of the club, building up the flange so that it sat lower than the leading edge when soled. The flange, not the leading edge, would contact the sand first, and explode sand as the shot was played. The additional weight provided punch to power through the thick sand. Sarazen's newly developed technique with the new club was to contact the sand a couple of inches behind the ball, not actually contacting the ball at all on most sand shots.|$|R

5|$|In the club's {{early history}} the {{appearance}} record {{was held by}} goalkeeper Arthur Cartlidge, who played in 258 Southern League games between 1901 and 1909. His record stood until it was broken by another goalkeeper, Jesse Whatley, who played 14 times in the Southern League and a further 372 in The Football League, making a total of 386 overall. Following the Second World War the Bristol Rovers board introduced a no-buy/no-sell policy, which remained in force until {{the abolition of the}} maximum wage in football in 1961; as a result some players in that era had a high number of appearances for the club. Eight of the top nine most-used players played during this time, each making over 400 appearances. These eight were <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones</b> (421 appearances), Alfie Biggs (424), Ray Warren (450), Harold Jarman (452), George Petherbridge (457), Geoff Bradford (462), Jack Pitt (466), and Harry Bamford (486). The club's all-time leading appearance maker, Stuart Taylor, played in 546 League games between 1965 and 1980. The club's highest scorer by a wide margin is Geoff Bradford, who scored 242 times in The Football League, exceeding the next-highest scorer Alfie Biggs by 64 goals.|$|E
40|$|This text {{is based}} on the {{hypothesis}} that in the representation of sport the main assumptions and categories of Romanticism form its dominant narratives. The Romanticism used the language not only to talk about sport but also to generate feelings about it. In this case, we will take this particular narrative of the movie "Bobby Jones - Stroke of Genius" in order to locate and interpretate the assumptions and cores of the romantic conception. In <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones's</b> filmed biography the basic aspects of Romanticism such as the notion of the Genius; the anguish of the division; the importance given to pleasure; the search for unity; the authenticity and the high value put on nature as well as its organic aspect are presented organizing the narrative. The movie develops its ideas from the perspective of enchanting the world again by setting a higher value on aspects of sensibility rather than on utilitarian ones. Sport, Golf especially in this case, presents itself as the greatest means as well as the greatest end of our whole realization as human beings, in patterns that are familiar to Romanticism...|$|R
5000|$|The majors {{originally}} {{consisted of}} two British tournaments, The Open Championship and The Amateur Championship, and two American tournaments, the U.S. Open and the U.S. Amateur. With {{the introduction of the}} Masters Tournament in 1934, and the rise of professional golf in the late 1940s and 1950s, the term [...] "major championships" [...] eventually came to describe the Masters, the U.S. Open, the Open Championship, and the PGA Championship. It is difficult to determine when the definition changed to include the current four tournaments, although many trace it to Arnold Palmer's 1960 season. After winning the Masters and the U.S. Open to start the season, he remarked that if he could win the Open Championship and PGA Championship to finish the season, he would complete [...] "a grand slam of his own" [...] to rival <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones's</b> 1930 feat. Until that time, many U.S. players such as Byron Nelson also considered the Western Open and the North and South Open as two of golf's [...] "majors," [...] and the British PGA Matchplay Championship was as important to British and Commonwealth professionals as the PGA Championship was to Americans.|$|R

25|$|Palmer is also {{credited}} by {{many for}} securing {{the status of}} The Open Championship (British Open) among U.S. players. Before Ben Hogan won that championship in 1953, few American professionals had traveled to play in The Open, due to its extensive travel requirements, relatively small purse, and the style of its links courses (radically different from most American courses). Palmer wanted to emulate the feats of his predecessors <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones,</b> Sam Snead and Hogan in his quest to become a leading American golfer.|$|E
25|$|With the win, Spieth {{became the}} sixth to win both the Masters and U.S. Open {{in the same}} year and the first since Tiger Woods in 2002. He also became the first to win two majors before the age of 22 since Gene Sarazen in 1922, and the {{youngest}} U.S. Open champion since <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones</b> in 1923. After opening with a round of 77 (+7), Oosthuizen shot 199 over his last three rounds, tying the U.S. Open record for lowest 54-hole score. His score of 29 on the back-nine also tied a tournament record.|$|E
25|$|Jones is {{considered}} one of the five giants of the 1920s American sports scene, along with baseball's Babe Ruth, boxing's Jack Dempsey, football's Red Grange, and tennis player Bill Tilden. He was the first recipient of the AAU's Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. He is the only sports figure to receive two ticker-tape parades in New York City, the first in 1926 and the second in 1930. Jones is memorialized in Augusta, Georgia, at the Golf Gardens and has the <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones</b> Expressway, also known as Interstate 520, named for him.|$|E
25|$|Each year, {{the tournament}} selects {{one or more}} {{individuals}} as honorees who have made a significant impact to the game. The inaugural tournament in 1976 paid tribute to the late <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones,</b> while the 25th edition in 2000 honored Nicklaus, himself. This concept was Nicklaus' idea as a contribution to perpetuating achievements of the game's greatest individuals. The honoree is selected by the Captain's Club, a group that acts independently of the tournament organization, but also advises on player invitations and the general conduct of the event. Members of the Captain's Club include Peter Alliss, Peggy Kirk Bell, George H.W. Bush, Sean Connery, Arnold Palmer, and Gary Player among others.|$|E
25|$|McIlroy won the U.S. Open held at Congressional in Bethesda, Maryland on 19 June winning {{by eight}} strokes over Jason Day. McIlroy set several records in his victory, most notably, his 72-hole {{aggregate}} score of 268 (16-under) {{was a new}} U.S. Open record. The 268 aggregate beat the previous record of 272 held by Jack Nicklaus (Baltusrol, 1980), Lee Janzen (Baltusrol, 1993), Tiger Woods (Pebble Beach, 2000), and Jim Furyk (Olympia Fields, 2003). The 16-under in relation to par beat Tiger Woods' 12 under at Pebble Beach Golf Links in 2000. He became the youngest winner since <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones</b> in 1923. The victory lifted McIlroy's position in the Official World Golf Ranking to a then career high of number four.|$|E
25|$|A {{runner up}} in the Amateur Championship twice (1928 and 1930), Wethered won the President's Putter five times. Furthermore, he was capped by England {{numerous}} times in competition against Scotland and in the Walker Cup against the United States, emerging victorious with regularity. In singles competition he beat all-comers, losing only to American golfer <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones.</b> He continued {{to be involved in}} golf, however, working with the committee at The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. He was elected captain of the club in 1939 and finally took office in 1946. He was successful as an investor and upon his retirement he returned to the golf courses to play out his remaining days. At the age of 74 he scored a remarkable round of 74 at the Royal Wimbledon Golf Club. He died at his home at Garnet House, Wimbledon.|$|E
25|$|For the 1995–96 season, the Bulls were {{bolstered by}} both Jordan's return to full {{form and the}} offseason {{acquisition}} of exceptional rebounder Dennis Rodman. With Pippen still at small forward, coach Phil Jackson saw it best to have Kukoč {{continue to be a}} bench player. Kukoč was third on the team in scoring (behind Jordan and Pippen) and was rewarded for his efforts with the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award. He also assisted the Bulls to a 25-game turnaround and the best record in league history at the time at 72–10 (later surpassed by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors), as well as the fourth championship in team history. Kukoč was the 4th and is currently the last player to win the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award and the NBA title in the same year having joined Kevin McHale, Bill Walton, and <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones</b> in accomplishing that feat.|$|E
25|$|St Andrews' {{historical}} {{links with}} the United States predate the country's independence. One of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence attended (but did not graduate from) St Andrews. James Wilson was one of six original justices appointed by George Washington to the Supreme Court of the United States {{and founder of the}} University of Pennsylvania Law School. Other prominent American figures associated with St Andrews include Scottish American industrialist Andrew Carnegie, who was elected Rector in 1901 and whose name is given to the prestigious Carnegie Scholarship, and Edward Harkness, an American philanthropist who in 1930 provided for the construction of St Salvator's Hall. American <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones,</b> co-founder of the Augusta National Golf Club and the Masters Tournament, was named a Freeman of the City of St Andrews in 1958, becoming only the second American to be so honored, the other being Benjamin Franklin in 1759. Today a highly competitive scholarship exchange, The Robert T. Jones Scholarship, exists between St Andrews and Emory University in Atlanta.|$|E
25|$|Malone {{became a}} {{restricted}} {{free agent after}} the 1981–82 season. He signed an offer sheet of six-years for $13.2million with Philadelphia on September 2, 1982. The 76ers were coming off a 4–2 loss in the Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers, whose center, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, dominated their big-man duo of Darryl Dawkins and Caldwell Jones. The Rockets were changing ownership and decided that Malone's $2million annual salary did not fit their plans. Houston matched the offer and agreed to trade Malone to the 76ers for Jones and their first-round pick in the 1983 NBA draft on September 15. With Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, Andrew Toney, and <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones,</b> the Sixers won the NBA championship. Malone was named the league MVP {{for the second straight}} year, becoming the only NBA player ever to win the award in consecutive seasons with two different teams, a feat matched only by Barry Bonds (1992–1993) in the four major American sports leagues.|$|E
25|$|Nicklaus won {{the first}} two major championships of 1972 by three shots each in wire-to-wire fashion. He won the Masters and the U.S. Open, {{creating}} talk of a calendar-year Grand Slam. Nicklaus opened with a four-under par 68 at Augusta National and never looked back. He was the only player under par for the week as he and the field battled difficult scoring conditions. In the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach again under severe scoring conditions, Nicklaus struck a one-iron on the 218-yard par-three 17th hole during the final round into a stiff, gusty ocean breeze that hit the flagstick and ended up three inches from the cup. The U.S. Open was Nicklaus' 13th career major and tied him with <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones</b> for career majors (although a different group of tournaments had been considered majors in Jones's time). This victory was also Nicklaus' 11th professional major, tying him with Walter Hagen, and made him {{the first player to}} win the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open championships on the same golf course.|$|E
25|$|The Bills next drive {{resulted}} in Ferguson's 4th consecutive interception, this one thrown to Jerry Holmes, but the Jets {{were forced to}} punt, and Lou Piccone returned Chuck Ramsey's 29-yard punt 5 yards to the New York 45-yard line. Then with just over 10 {{minutes left in the}} game, Cribbs ran for a 45-yard touchdown, increasing the Bills lead to 31–13. Todd then led the Jets 80 yards in eight plays and completed a 30-yard touchdown pass to <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones.</b> Then after forcing a punt that Harper returned 6 yards to his own 42, New York drove for another score, aided by a pass interference call against Bills defensive back Mario Clark that nullified an interception. Kevin Long finished the 58-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run to cut the score to 31–27. The Jets got the ball back with 2:36 remaining and then drove 69 yards to the Buffalo 11-yard line, aided by a holding penalty that wiped out an interception by defensive back Steve Freeman. Todd also made several key completions, including a 29-yarder to Shuler and a 26-yard pass to Derrick Gaffney on third and 20. However, Simpson's interception at the 1-yard line halted New York's comeback with two seconds left.|$|E

25|$|Leading {{centers of}} the late 1970s and early 1980s include Wes Unseld of the Baltimore/Washington Bullets, Artis Gilmore of the ABA Kentucky Colonels, Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs; Moses Malone of the Houston Rockets and Philadelphia 76ers; Mark Eaton of the Utah Jazz and Robert Parish of the Boston Celtics, who was {{acquired}} from the Golden State Warriors in 1980 for the top overall pick in the NBA Draft. Unseld led the Bullets to four NBA finals appearances and one championship, in 1978. Using his strength and determination to compensate for his lack of size (6'7", i.e. 2.00 m), he was famous for his rebounding, shotblocking, and bone-jarring picks. Artis Gilmore, often overlooked because of the mediocrity of his teams, established himself as the best low-post scorer in the league. He set the NCAA Division I record for career average in rebounds (25.2) at tiny Jacksonville University, and enjoyed an illustrious ABA career before joining the NBA's Chicago Bulls in 1976, playing there until he was traded to San Antonio in 1982, for whom he played {{until his retirement in}} 1987. He remains the NBA's career leader in field goal percentage (minimum 2000 shots made) with a 59.9 percentage. Malone, the first high school player to turn professional, was drafted by the Houston Rockets after several years in the ABA, and won two MVP Awards and led Houston to its first NBA Finals in 1981, before joining the Philadelphia 76ers, where, teamed with Julius Erving and <b>Bobby</b> <b>Jones,</b> he won an NBA Championship in 1983, as well as a third League MVP.
