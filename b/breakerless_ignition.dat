50|$|The 124-series engine {{has five}} main bearings, an iron block and an alloy head. Intake and exhaust are both {{located on the}} {{right-hand}} side of the engine. The Brazilian engine was the first overhead cam version developed, first shown in autumn of 1976. It took nearly five years before the Italian-built engines were changed to such a design. The Brazilian engine, which first appeared in a 1.05-litre version, has chrome-treated exhaust valves with stellite seats, for increased durability. It also received <b>breakerless</b> <b>ignition</b> (electronic) and the camshaft is driven by a toothed belt.|$|E
2500|$|The Tempest line, {{including}} the GTO, was restyled for the 1965 model year, adding [...] {{to the overall}} length while retaining the same wheelbase and interior dimensions. It had Pontiac's characteristic vertically stacked quad headlights. Overall weight increased about [...] The brake lining area increased nearly 15%. Heavy-duty shocks were standard, as was a stronger front antisway bar. The dashboard design was changed, and an optional rally gauge cluster ($86.08) added a more legible tachometer and oil pressure gauge. An additional option was a <b>breakerless</b> transistor <b>ignition.</b>|$|R
50|$|As an {{automobile}} manufacturer, BMW had about {{twenty years of}} experience with liquid cooled overhead camshaft inline engines. This was carried over to the K100 engine, which used a Bosch LE-Jetronic fuel injection similar to that being introduced on their second generation 3 Series cars. Replacing the Bing carburettors traditionally used on BMW motorcycles, the fuel injection system increased power, broadened and smoothed the powerband, and reduced fuel consumption, partly by shutting off fuel under deceleration to 2000 rpm. The engine also featured a <b>breakerless</b> electronic <b>ignition</b> system.|$|R
50|$|The Tempest line, {{including}} the GTO, was restyled for the 1965 model year, adding 3.1 {{in to the}} overall length while retaining the same wheelbase and interior dimensions. It had Pontiac's characteristic vertically stacked quad headlights. Overall weight increased about 100 lb. The brake lining area increased nearly 15%. Heavy-duty shocks were standard, as was a stronger front antisway bar. The dashboard design was changed, and an optional rally gauge cluster ($86.08) added a more legible tachometer and oil pressure gauge. An additional option was a <b>breakerless</b> transistor <b>ignition.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The range {{added an}} option of a five-door fastback/hatchback bodystyle, named CC {{in a few}} markets. The five-door fastback/hatchback model was shorter than the saloons, with a {{marginally}} smaller luggage compartment and 5 cm less head space in the backseat. All engines were now SOHC crossflow designs with a <b>breakerless</b> <b>ignition</b> system and hydraulic tappets. The base model was the 1.3 L introduced in 1978 in the Ascona B, with 60 PS (44 kW), followed by a 1.6 L with 75 PS (55 kW). [...] "S" [...] versions with higher compression ratio had power increased {{by as much as}} twenty percent. The top of the line was the sporty GTE model, with electronic fuel injection, pushing power to 130 PS (96 kW) in the last two model years. Diesel power came from an Isuzu-developed block, with 1.6 litres. Catalytic converters were optional in the larger petrol units starting from 1986.|$|E
50|$|A major {{mid-cycle}} refresh débuted at the April 1986 Turin Motor Show. Changes {{were made}} to the exterior and interior of the car. Outside there were more modern, enveloping bumpers—the front one with provisions for integrated fog lights; the redesigned grille and bonnet bore a family resemblance to the flagship Thema. Also new were the ventilation grille on the C-pillar and full-wheel hubcaps. Inside new seats, new instrumentation and air conditioning system.The 1986 range included seven models, two of them all-new: 1.3, 1.5, 1.5 Automatica, 1.6, 1.6 i.e., 4WD, diesel and turbo ds. 1.3 and 1.5 models had revised intake and exhaust system, fuel cut-off, a new carburettor and <b>breakerless</b> <b>ignition.</b> The diesel versions had also received some minor engine updates, and the turbo diesel had been renamed turbo ds.The new Prisma 1.6 i.e. used a version of the 1585 cc twin-cam engine equipped with Weber-Marelli IAW integrated electronic ignition and fuel injection system, developing 108 PS. In comparison to the carburetted Prisma 1600—which remained on sale as Prisma 1.6—further changes had been made: the cylinder head had been rotated 180°, bringing the exhaust side to the front for better cooling, and the whole engine was canted forward 18° to lower its centre of gravity.|$|E
50|$|The HF turbo soon {{lost its}} crown as {{top-of-the-range}} Delta, as the turbocharged 2.0-litre and four-wheel drive Delta HF 4WD was unveiled at the April 1986 Turin Motor Show.Some {{of the features}} of the HF 4WD previewed a major mid-cycle refresh for the entire Delta range, announced in May 1986 and put on sale in June.New enveloping bumpers—the front one with provisions for integrated fog lights—gave the car a more modern look; the entire front end was changed with a new grille and new headlight covers, which were slanted forward and protruded from the bodywork {{in an effort to make}} the car more aerodynamic. The roof spoiler introduced in 1982 was removed.Seven models composed the 1986 range: 1.3, LX 1.3, 1.5 Automatica, GT i.e., HF turbo, HF 4WD and turbo ds.Entry-level model was the 1.3; the 1,301 cc engine had revised intake and exhaust system, fuel cut-off, a new carburettor and <b>breakerless</b> <b>ignition.</b> It was also available on the more upscale LX 1.3. Similar changes were made to the powertrain of the Delta 1.5 Automatica.The Delta GT and HF turbo were given Weber IAW integrated electronic ignition and fuel injection system to become the Delta GT i.e. and the Delta HF turbo i.e., with 108 PS and 140 PS respectively. Deeper changes had been made to the GT i.e. engine: the cylinder head had been rotated 180°, bringing the exhaust side to the front for better cooling, and the whole engine was canted forward 18° to lower its centre of gravity. Delta HF turbo was updated to HF 4WD looks and interior, from which it differed mainly for the square headlights and single exhaust.Delta turbo ds marked the introduction of the first diesel engine on the Delta. This was a 1,929 cc 8-valve four-cylinder from the Prisma, with an output of 80 PS; it used a KKK turbocharger with wastegate valve, an intercooler and an oil cooler. The turbo ds was positioned on the market like the GT i.e., and given similarly complete standard equipment comprising such features as an oil pressure gauge, boost pressure gauge and power steering.|$|E
5000|$|The Rotax 447 is a {{development}} of the Rotax 377, increasing the power output from [...] to [...] by increasing the cylinder bore from 62 mm to 67.5 mm and the maximum rpm from 6500 to 6800. The modern 447 has a single <b>breakerless,</b> magneto capacitor-discharge <b>ignition</b> (CDI) system. Early (ca. 1988) models use a breaker point ignition system.|$|R
25|$|The Rotax 503 {{features}} piston ported, air-cooled {{cylinder heads}} and cylinders, utilizing either a fan or free air for cooling. Lubrication is either {{by use of}} pre-mixed fuel and oil or oil injection from an externally mounted oil tank. The 503 has dual independent <b>breakerless,</b> magneto capacitor-discharge <b>ignition</b> (CDI) systems and can be equipped with either one or two piston-type carburetors. It uses a manifold-driven pneumatic fuel pump to provide fuel pressure. An optional High Altitude Compensation kit is available.|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{two-stroke}} spark-ignition (SI) engines {{have difficulty}} meeting the ignition requirements of lean fuel-air mixtures and high compression ratios, {{due to their}} breaker operated, magneto-coil ignition systems. In the present work, a <b>breakerless,</b> high-energy electronic <b>ignition</b> system was developed and tested with and without a platinum-tipped electrode spark plug. The high-energy ignition system showed an improved lean-burn capability at high compression ratios relative to the conventional ignition system. At a high compression ratio of 9 : 1 with lean fuel-air mixtures, the maximum percentage improvement in the brake thermal efficiency was about 16. 5 % at 2. 7 kW and 3000 rpm. Cylinder peak pressures-were higher ignition delay was lower, and combustion duration was shorter at both normal and high compression ratios. Combustion stability {{as measured by the}} coefficient of variation in peak cylinder pressure was also considerably improved with the high-energy ignition system...|$|R
