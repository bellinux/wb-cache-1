Although the Concise Guide represents approximately 400 pages, the material presented is substantially reduced compared to information and links presented on the website. It provides a permanent, citable, point-in-time record that will survive database updates. The full contents of this section can be found at [URL] In addition to this overview, in which are identified 'Other protein targets' which fall outside of the subsequent categorisation, there are eight areas of focus: G protein-coupled receptors, ligand-gated ion channels, voltage-gated ion channels, other ion channels, nuclear hormone receptors, catalytic receptors, enzymes and transporters. These are presented with nomenclature guidance and summary information on the best available pharmacological tools, alongside key references and suggestions for further reading. The landscape format of the Concise Guide is designed to facilitate comparison of related targets from material contemporary to mid- 2017, and supersedes data presented in the 2015 / 16 and 2013 / 14 Concise Guides and previous Guides to Receptors and Channels.

50|$|He {{was born}} Giuseppe Pivato in Tezze sul Brenta, a town about 40 km north of Venice, Italy. His mother, Meri Sabucco, was from Udine in the Friuli region east of Venice.

The family emigrated to Toronto, Canada, in 1952 where the Catholic nuns changed his name to Joseph. He attended St. Michael's College School, an academic high school for boys, where he studied languages and literature. He enrolled at York University where he studied with modernist scholar, D.E.S. Maxwell, feminist and medievalist, Beryl Rowland, Canadian writer, Irving Layton, met French poet Hedi Bouraoui and poet-critic, Eli Mandel. With D.E.S. Maxwell he enrolled in the first course in African Literature (1969). In the summers he worked with Italian bricklayers to help pay for his university fees. In 1968 he founded and edited the first literary magazine at York, Voodoo Poetry at Vanier College.

His 1971 M.A. thesis was on Dante and Baudelaire. Writer and academic E.D. Blodgett was his advisor for his Ph.D. thesis on hermetic poetry. He also met Canadian writers Henry Kreisel and Sheila Watson and began to work on Canadian authors publishing his first critical essay in Canadian Literature (1973, editor George Woodcock) while he was still a graduate student. At the end of his doctoral program (1977) he began to work at Athabasca University, a distance education institution modeled after the British Open University. At Athabasca he helped to develop the first courses in English literature, Canadian Literature, Comparative Literature and theory. He was promoted to Full Professor in 1986. He was founding president of the Association of Italian-Canadian Writers(1986) which advances the work of these ethnic minority authors through critical <b>publications,</b> <b>biennial</b> conferences, book launches and literary readings across Canada and in Italy.

The Report begins by providing a much-awaited review of the place of the social sciences on a world scale. What has been their historical trajectory over the twentieth century, and what are their prospects for the coming decades? How are the social sciences currently organized, financed and practised in different parts of the world – East and West, developed or developing? Where do the data come from, and how are they processed, analysed and transmitted? How does social science research relate to policy, politics, ethics and the media? The second part of the Report takes up certain major issues facing the world, asking what solutions the social sciences have been able to bring. What are the social implica-tions of the onrush of computer technology and the life sciences? What light can be cast by economics, political science and sociology on the stakes of development?

40|$|ECLAC Economic Commission for Latin American Countries has {{established}} a statistical database {{on a wide variety}} of economic and social subjects for the CDCC countries of the Caribbean in recognition of the vital role played by statistics in the decision-making process. This now includes a special sub-sector on agricultural statistics. The CDCC countries, which embrace several ACP states, work together to break cultural and linguistic barriers and to foster economic and social develop ment through mutual self-help. They include: Bahamas, Barba dos, Belize, Cuba, Dominica Dominican Republic, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, The Netherlands Antilles, Saint Kitts Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent, Suriname, the British Virgin Islands, the US Virgin Islands and Trinidad and Tobago. The first objective of the compilers was to collate, store and disseminate statistics of government departments and statutory boards with the intention of providing only single-source data. The second was to make an inventory of major statistical publicabons of the various countries, and to prepare abstracts of their contents so that the resulting document could be searched for subject matter or tabular content. The constructors of the database used elements of the meta-data system that guides researchers to the tables, and allows them to understand more fully the numbers as stored in the time series that form the core of the database. A Directory of Major Statistical Publications was prepared and published, and eventually Major Statistical Publications - Abstracts was also brought out. This provides a fuller bibliographic treatment of the documents cited in the Directory, and is one component of a three-part document consisting of Publisher/Title index; Abstracts; and Series Index. The Abstracts is intended to provide bibliographical coverage for a select number of statistical publications generated periodically within the Caribbean region and which give statistical data for a number of social and economic factors. The records entered in the abstracts have been structured to convey the following informabon: country to which the data relate; name of the agent responsible for the publication, title; a source number code which denotes country, publisher, and numeric sequence; frequency or periodicity, publishing dates of those entries held in the Caribbean Documentation Centre; and content. All statistics published are provisional, and revisions are numerous. A record of requests for information is kept; note is taken of the series requested for which no coverage is held and attempts are made to expand the scope of the database in the light of these. The special agricultural statisbcs sub-sector puts out a <b>biennial</b> <b>publication</b> giving information on production, land use and tenure, land area and area under cultivation, population (including agricultural population) and the contribution of agriculture to Gross Domestic Product.
