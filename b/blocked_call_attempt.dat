50|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of step-by-step and other early systems {{is that the}} preference for choosing trunks or selector links is fixed, and the most preferred links are used more often, {{with the result that}} the same faulty hardware <b>blocks</b> repeated <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> until it is removed from service. 5XB markers were designed to rotate preferences {{in such a way that}} it is highly unlikely that the same circuit elements will be used in the next call. Thus, if a call encounters an equipment problem, a second try will probably succeed.|$|R

40|$|A new PCS {{hand-off}} {{scheme is}} proposed. This scheme provides for hand-off to radio ports on {{which there is}} no free channel by "sub-rating" an existing connection. With sub-rating, an occupied full-rate channel is temporarily divided into two half-rate channels: one to serve the existing call and the other to serve the hand-off request. The blocking probabilities (combined forced terminations of existing <b>calls</b> and <b>blocking</b> of new <b>call</b> <b>attempts)</b> of this new scheme compare favorably with the standard (non-prioritizing) schemes and the previously proposed prioritizing schemes. The "costs" for this scheme are presented and discussed, as well as the additional procedural complexity to implement on-the-fly sub-rating, and the impact of continuing the conversation on a lower rate channel (which may have lower speech quality or increase battery drain). Analytical models and simulations investigating the traffic impacts are presented, as are the results which show that even in the highest offere [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The study {{presents}} {{a determination of}} traffic load and traffic performance parameters (indicators) in mobile communication network, using Nigeria (Lagos) as a case study. The operation and maintenance unit which is in-built with the mobile communication network {{was used as a}} measuring device. The traffic data obtained from the mobile network are; number of complete call, number of <b>calls</b> <b>attempts</b> and service time (calls duration) for the period of one year. These traffic parameters was used to determine the offered traffic, block traffic (loss traffic) and other traffic performance parameters also called Traffic Key Performance Indicator (KPI). They are Calls Completion Rate (CCR), Busy Hour <b>Call</b> <b>Attempt</b> (BHCA), Grade of Service (GOS) and Channels Utilization Percentage (CUP). It was discovered that route 9 and 10 Call Completion Rate (CCR) was not in accordance with Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC, 2008) regulation. The Grade of Service (GOS) of route 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 18 are not in accordance with NCC regulation. Also, the channel utilization percentage is above 60 % stated by NCC. These will result in loss of <b>calls</b> or <b>block</b> <b>calls</b> in affected routes. Effort should be made by operators to provide good quality of service (QOS) and monitoring agency (NCC) should ensure that they conform to recommended standard to avoid <b>block</b> <b>calls</b> during the busy hour...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of the spectral resources and mobility of the portables, the <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> may be <b>blocked</b> during <b>call</b> initiation or terminated during the hand-off process. When the blocking ratio exceeds some grade of service level, {{the capacity of the}} congested cell must be replanned using the <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> data. However, most of the time, the measurements are inflated by the redials and the retrials. During the replanning process, the first step should be to calculate the effective load from the measured cumulative call statistics. In this paper, we provide simpleto-implement analytical models that compute the average number of retrials and redials per original <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> using only the operations and maintenance center (OMC) measurements. The effective load is then determined through appropriate scaling. That way, unnecessary waste of channels to sustain retrials and redials is avoided during the cellular capacity replanning phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{soft handoff}} call {{requests}} of real-time services in third-generation (3 G) direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) and first- and second-generation cellular systems {{are more important}} than new call requests from the viewpoint of quality of service (QoS). Rejection of soft handoff requests causes forced termination of an ongoing real-time call, which is a severer problem than <b>blocking</b> of new <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> An admission control scheme that can guarantee a higher QoS for the soft handoff requests of real-time services in 3 G DS-CDMA systems is proposed for delay-sensitive voice and delay-tolerant stream-type data services. The proposed scheme (P-Scheme) accommodates both voice and data services by utilizing the full bandwidth. However, voice soft handoff call requests are given priority over new voice call and stream-type data packet requests by suppressing interference from stream-type data services according to voice soft handoff requests, and by varying interference levels. Performance of the P-Scheme is evaluated using a Markovian model. Results are compared with a conventional reservation scheme (C-Scheme) that reserves resources exclusively for voice soft handoff requests. Numerical results show that system performance can be significantly improved using the proposed P-Scheme, compared with the conventional C-Scheme, when various types of service are supported in third-generation DS-CDMA systems...|$|R
30|$|The maximum Erlang {{capacity}} is computed as the maximum {{value of the}} offered traffic for which all the QoS requirements are still met. Maximum Erlang {{capacity is}} obtained by optimizing the number of reserved channels to prioritize intra- and inter-cell handoff <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> over new <b>call</b> requests. The optimal value {{of the number of}} reserved channels is systematically searched by using the fact that new <b>call</b> <b>blocking</b> (handoff failure) probability is a monotonically increasing (decreasing) function of the number of reserved channels. Once a value of the number of reserved channels for which the new <b>call</b> <b>blocking</b> probability and/or handoff failure probability achieves its maximum acceptable value is found, another offered traffic load is tested. The capacity maximization procedure ends when both the new <b>call</b> <b>blocking</b> probability and forced call termination probability achieve their maximum acceptable values.|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> in a {{telephone}} survey is an important decision. A large number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> makes the data collection costly and time-consuming; and {{a small number of}} attempts decreases the response set from which conclusions are drawn and increases the variance.

In this paper we study the effects of number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> on the nonresponse rate and the nonresponse bias in two surveys conducted by Statistics Sweden: The Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Household Finances (HF). By use of paradata we calculate the response rate as a function of the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> To estimate the nonresponse bias we use estimates of some register variables, where observations are available for both respondents and nonrespondents. We also calculate estimates of some real survey parameters as functions of varying number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> The results indicate that it is possible to reduce the current number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> without getting an increased nonresponse bias...|$|R

40|$|In {{telephone}} surveys, several <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> {{are often}} needed {{to establish contact}} with selected individuals. We consider the problem of choosing {{the maximum number of}} <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> to be made to each selected individual before he or she is classified as unavailable. This is an important question since a large number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> makes the data collection costly and time-consuming; a small number of attempts decreases the response set from which conclusions are drawn. We start from the assumptions that the survey goal is to estimate a population total, that the sample can be divided into response homogeneity groups, and that the direct weighting estimator is to be used. We suggest a strategy for choosing the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> that takes the survey design, non-response, measurement errors and costs of data collection into account. The strategy relies on models for non-response and measurement errors. In our models, the impact of the error sources on the estimator may differ for different numbers of <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> According to our strategy, the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> is decided through a comparison of the estimator’s standard error for different numbers of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> but the same cost. Next we study the case when the response homogeneity groups do not work properly but there remains a non-response bias.

This letter presents dynamic algorithms which randomly <b>block</b> some <b>calls</b> at their origination points, thus reducing traffic in the network.

The algorithms reduce <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> by 50 % during periods of 80 % blocking, with little disruption in blocking levels to the dialing customers (blocking increases by less than 1 %). We also derive an improved blocking heuristic which is more effective under periods of heavier congestion. Index Terms—Communication systems, information rates, traffic control (communication).
