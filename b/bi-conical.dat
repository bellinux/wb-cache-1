50|$|Many of {{the late}} Bronze Age grave goods {{come in the form}} of <b>bi-conical,</b> lens-like urns. Typical of the Golasecca era, most graves have one or more ceramic vessels (urns, bowls, mugs and more rarely jugs) along with {{ornaments}} made of bronze (brooches, earrings, pendant, belt buckles) and amber (necklaces, earrings and beads). Some of the bronze vessels are situlas (bucket-like containers), but the other typical vessels of the Golasecca culture (such as beak jugs) have not been found. Particularly noteworthy is a bucket (from the turn of the 6th to the 5th century BC) carved with characters in the Lugano or Lepontic.|$|E

In 2003, Rammellzee released his debut album, This Is What You Made Me, and performed at the Knitting Factory in New York with the newly reformed Death Comet Crew. Subsequently Troubleman Unlimited re-released recordings made by DCC between 1982 and 1984. Their single for Exterior St was featured on the compilation Anti-NY with Ike Yard, Sexual Harassment, and Vivien Goldman, among others. In 2004, Rammellzee released his second album <b>Bi-Conicals</b> of the Rammellzee, produced by Gomma Records.

50|$|The oldest {{phases of}} the Etruscan Bologna (Villanovan and Orientalising, from the 9th {{to the middle of}} the 6th century B.C.) are {{illustrated}} by the vast selection from the approximately 4,000 tomb kits discovered: vases characterised by a <b>bi-conical</b> form (for the deposition of the ashes of the dead), objects for personal use and bronze tools, pottery and bronze vases. Among the many pieces on display one may find: the Benacci askos, a very rare vase typology used to contain the oil for the lanterns and the “closet of Saint Frances” i.e. the deposit of a foundry made of a big vase (dolium) containing more than 14,000 bronze pieces.|$|E
5000|$|The ovate {{shell is}} thick, solid and <b>bi-conical.</b> It is whitish, {{covered with a}} reddish epidermis. It shows nine or ten {{longitudinal}} folds, more strongly marked upon the body whorl, rarely prolonged {{as far as the}} base, and regularly divided into tubercles by more prominent transverse striae, the interstices of which are furnished with other much finer and very approximate striae. The spire is obtuse at its summit. It is composed of five or six slightly distinct whorls. The lowest is very broad, flattened at its upper part, and subangular. The aperture is white, ovate, narrowed at its base, canaliculated at its upper part, at its union with the outer lip which is thin and denticulated at the edge, striated within. Externally, in adult shells, a pretty prominent varix is observed. The columella is slightly bent, furnished throughout its whole length with small nodules.|$|E
50|$|In 1894 C. B. Moore {{described}} the mound {{as being a}} truncated cone mound 8.1 m in height, with a base diameter of 65.8 m a summit diameter of 7.3 m. When he excavated the mound he found {{a large number of}} graves and many artifacts, although all of the artifacts {{do not seem to be}} associated with burials as grave goods. The artifacts were of both local and nonlocal manufacture and included 147 polished stone celts, chipped stone tools, soapstone smoking pipes, shell drinking cups of the type used for the black drink ritual, bone pins, pottery and a variety of items made from or covered with copper. The copper items included embossed plaques, beads, two <b>bi-conical</b> ear spools and two long-nosed god maskettes. Both the copper covered earspools and long-nosed god maskettes are rare items that have associations with the Cahokia site in western Illinois and the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex.|$|E
5000|$|Rammellzee {{revealed}} in a 2008 {{interview that he}} saw the single as [...] "just simply a test pressing" [...] {{and that he had}} no specific expectations. However, he admitted that its surprise success changed the direction of his life, allowing him to tour around the world instead of being a dentist as he originally intended. The single has sold more than 150,000 copies, though Rammellzee insists that he has received no money from it. On his 2004 debut full-length release, <b>Bi-Conicals</b> of the Rammellzee, Rammellzee reunited with K-Rob to record [...] "Beat Bop Part 2". Though K-Rob was now a [...] "full fledged Muslim", devoting his time to prayers and preaching rather than music, Rammellzee was happy with the result: [...] "I thought it was fantastic the second time around... this time me and K-Rob were doing fine without crushing up papers and being stalled by a person who wanted things to be done his way." [...] "Beat Bop Part 2" [...] is a decidedly retrospective track, a throwback to early 1980s rap, with Rammellzee commenting in its first verse: [...] "I know it's been a while since you heard me rap, but I had to bring it back since the shit got wack." ...|$|R

A 3. 5 dB improvement in return loss for the band, (0. 5 - 2. 0) GHz, is predicted for the modified <b>bi-conical</b> antenna over the conventional <b>bi-conical</b> antenna.

30|$|<b>Bi-conical</b> {{reflectance}} {{measurements were}} taken in vacuum with an A 513 accessory unit, setting incidence angle to the minimum possible (i =  13 °) and varying the emission angle between 13 ° and 80 °. In a recent paper, we show that <b>bi-conical</b> reflectance spectra of samples measured at PEL under purging or under vacuum conditions are identical (Maturilli et al. 2015).|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that only {{hemispherical}} reflectance measurements can be directly compared with emissivity measurement of samples under thermal equilibrium with the surrounding medium (Salisbury and Walter 1989). Therefore, strictly speaking our <b>bi-conical</b> reflectance measurements (with angles incidence = emission =  13 °, no correction for grazing angles needed) can only qualitatively be compared to our emissivity measurements made under vacuum (where the lack of air between the grains gives rise to vertical thermal gradients). However, <b>bi-conical</b> reflectance measurements are more representative of the way spacecraft instruments obtain reflectance measurements than hemispherical reflectance measurements. Therefore, data obtained by combining <b>bi-conical</b> reflectance and emission measurements can be applied directly to the analysis of data returned by NIR/TIR instruments.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSingle nanoconstriction per {{magnetic}} wire is obtained by <b>bi-conical</b> track etching and electrodeposition. Magnetoresistance measurements at various angles result in irreversible jumps.

We show that in a magnetic device composed of two conical nanowires connected by a nanosized constriction, a DW can be trapped and detrapped. The magnetoreistance and the relaxation processes of the DW exhibit a specific behavior. Such a device has been fabricating by Ni electrodeposition in <b>bi-conical</b> tracks polymer membrane made of Swift Heavy Ions bombarded poly(VDF-co-TrFE) copolymer and poly(ethylene terephtalate) PET thin films.

40|$|We {{present results}} of HST {{observations}} of the radio galaxy 3 C 299. The broad-band F 702 W (R) and F 555 W (V) images (WFPC 2 /PC) show an elliptical galaxy, with a comet-like structure extending to the NE in the radio jet direction. The [OIII]λ 5007 emission line map, shows a <b>bi-conical</b> structure centered on the nucleus, that overlaps the structure found in the broad-band filters. The radio core coincides with {{the center of the}} <b>bi-conical</b> structure and the radio axes are aligned with the direction of the cones. These data show clear evidence of a strong interaction between the radio jet and the NE morphology of the galaxy. We show evidence that this NE region is an ENLR; the line-ratio diagnostics show that models involving gas shocked by the radio-jet plus ionization from a precursor HII region, produced itself by the ionizing photons of the postshocked gas on the preshocked gas provide a good match to the observations.

40|$|The IUE {{data base}} {{is used to}} analyze the UV line shapes of cataclysmic {{variables}} RW Sex, RW Tri, and V Sge. Observed lines are compared to synthetic line profiles computed using a model of rotating <b>bi-conical</b> winds from accretion disks. The wind model calculates the wind ionization structure self-consistently including photoionization from the disk and boundary layer and treats 3 -D line radiation transfer in the Sobolev approximation. It is found that winds from accretion disks provide a good fit for reasonable parameters to the observed UV lines which include the P Cygni profiles for low inclination systems and pure emission at large inclination. Disk winds are preferable to spherical winds which originate on the white dwarf because they (1) require a much lower ratio of mass loss rate to accretion rate and are therefore more plausible energetically, (2) provide a natural source for a <b>bi-conical</b> distribution of mass outflow which produces strong scattering far above the disk leading to P Cygni profiles for low inclination systems, and pure line emission profiles at high inclination with the absence of eclipses in UV lines, and (3) produce rotation broadened pure emission lines at high inclination...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} the dominant nuclear outflow mechanisms in Active Galactic Nuclei, we have undertaken deep, high resolution observations of two compact radio sources (PKS 1549 - 79 and PKS 1345 + 12) with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Not only are these targets known to have powerful emission line outflows, but they also contain all the potential drivers for the outflows: relativistic jets, quasar nuclei and starbursts. ACS allows the compact nature (< 0. ′ ′ 15) of these radio sources to be optically resolved for the first time. Through comparison with existing radio maps we have seen consistency in the nuclear position angles of both the optical emission line and radio data. There is no evidence for <b>bi-conical</b> emission line features on the large-scale {{and there is a}} divergance in the relative position angles of the optical and radio structure. This enables us to exclude starburst driven outflows. However, we are unable to clearly distinguish between radiative AGN wind driven outflows and outflows powered by relativistic radio jets. The small scale <b>bi-conical</b> features, indicative of such mechanisms could be below the resolution limit of ACS, especially if aligned close to the line of sight. In addition, there may be offsets between the radio and optical nuclei induced by heavy dust obscuration, nebular continuum or scattered light from the AGN...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether alternative HDR prostate brachytherapy catheter patterns {{can result in}} improved dose distributions while providing better access and reducing trauma. Methods: Prostate HDR brachytherapy uses a grid of parallel needle positions to guide the catheter insertion. This geometry does not easily allow the physician to avoid piercing the critical structures near the penile bulb nor does it provide position flexibility {{in the case of}} pubic arch interference. On CT data from ten previously-treated patients new catheters were digitized following three catheter patterns: conical, <b>bi-conical,</b> and fireworks. The conical patterns were used to accommodate a robotic delivery using a single entry point. The <b>bi-conical</b> and fireworks patterns were specifically designed to avoid the critical structures near the penile bulb. For each catheter distribution, a plan was optimized with the inverse planning algorithm, IPSA, and compared with the plan used for treatment. Irrelevant of catheter geometry, a plan must fulfill the RTOG- 0321 dose criteria for target dose coverage. Results: Thirty plans from ten patients were optimized. All non-standard patterns fulfilled the RTOG criteria when the clinical plan did. In some cases, the dose distribution was improved by better sparing the organs-at-risk. Conclusion: Alternative catheter patterns can provide the physician with additional ways to treat patients previously considered unsuited for brachytherapy treatment (pubic arch interference) and facilitate robotic guidance of catheter insertion. In addition, alternative catheter patterns may decrease toxicity by avoidance of the critical structures near the penile bulb while still fulfilling the RTOG criteria.
