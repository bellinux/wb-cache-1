There are 365×12 + 3 = 4383 {{days in the}} 12 years before 2012, so this is day 185 of the year. This day number begins at 0 on January 1, rather than 1 like the <b>BCD</b> <b>time</b> <b>code,</b> so it encodes the same date.|$|E

40|$|A {{high quality}} <b>time</b> <b>code</b> and word clock {{synchronization}} {{is essential to}} prevent audio drop outs and flutters in sound studios. A bad adjustment of <b>time</b> <b>code</b> generators respectively word clock synchronizers requires extensive error checks in synchronization networks. For this reason, a new measurement method is presented which enables sound engineers to measure longitudinal <b>time</b> <b>code</b> jitter and to check <b>time</b> <b>code</b> / word clock synchronization.

40|$|WO 2004105034 A UPAB: 20050124 NOVELTY - To {{synchronize}} {{sound and}} film, a detection unit (10) registers the <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> for each separate {{image in the}} film sequence. A <b>time</b> <b>code</b> generator (12) gives a sequence of synthesis <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> from a starting value, provided by a decoder (14) which processes the detected <b>time</b> <b>codes.</b> The detected and synthesis <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> are compared (16) to establish any phase deviations which require a manipulation (20) of the synthesis <b>time</b> <b>codes.</b> The synthesis <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> are fed to an audio processing unit (24), to allocate the sampled audio signal values to each image from detected synthesis <b>time</b> <b>codes,</b> under <b>time</b> control.

50|$|Because {{a single}} <b>time</b> <b>code</b> {{is made up}} of 40 {{consecutive}} bits, read errors can cause a timecode to be unreadable even if a single bit is misread.

40|$|The {{availability}} of multiple transmit antennas allows for two-dimensional channel codes that exploit the spatial transmit diversity. These codes {{were referred to}} as space [...] <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> by Tarokh et al. Most prior works on space [...] <b>time</b> <b>code</b> design have considered quasi-static fading channels.
