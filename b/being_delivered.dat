5|$|Although {{existing}} sources do not record {{when the}} Mk. XIV went into {{production in the}} UK, they do record that operational testing started in January 1942 and production examples started reaching squadrons in March. It was manufactured by small machine shops and instrument makers, such as the Aron Meter Company. Production was too slow to meet the demand; between July and October, fewer than a hundred a month were <b>being</b> <b>delivered.</b> As the design was finalized, automated production was undertaken and by mid-1943, 900 a month were available. This was enough to equip the heavy bombers as they arrived from the production lines and by late 1942 the Handley Page Halifax was <b>being</b> <b>delivered</b> with the sight head already installed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{operational}} Hotspur {{arrived at}} the Central Landing Establishment between February and April 1941, with 15 <b>being</b> <b>delivered</b> by 22 August. Towing trials began in February 1941 with a Boulton & Paul Overstrand bomber.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} seven years {{following}} 1988, when the CF-18 was <b>being</b> <b>delivered,</b> the squadron ran six-month full-squadron courses from which the graduating pilots formed new CF-18 squadrons. Following this initial cadre of courses, No.410 Squadron trained CF-18 pilots {{at a rate of}} approximately 50 per year. In 1992, with the closure of three squadrons in Germany, this was reduced to 25. With the recent reduction in size of the remaining operational squadrons, No.410 Squadron now trains approximately 20 fighter pilots annually.|$|E

5|$|On 13 July 2002, the {{regiment}} {{was presented with}} its current Standard by the then Governor General, Dr. Peter Hollingworth. On 26 July 2007, after 31 years of service the Leopard was replaced by 59 M1A1 Abrams AIM, with 41 <b>being</b> <b>delivered</b> to {{the regiment}} and the remaining vehicles issued to the School of Armour for use for training purposes. Seven M88A2 Hercules Armoured Recovery Vehicles were also acquired, two <b>being</b> <b>delivered</b> to the regiment. The Leopards never saw operational service, although during the 1999 East Timor crisis the regiment was placed on standby to deploy in the event the conflict escalated, while the regiment was not deployed during Australia's involvement in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Members of the unit later deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan as Bushmaster PMV crews, while others have also served in East Timor and the Solomon Islands. During this period the regiment was the only main battle tank unit in the Australian Army and was based at Robertson Barracks, in Darwin. Until 2013 it {{provided the basis for}} one of three battlegroups within the mechanised 1st Brigade, which included two mechanised infantry battalions, one cavalry regiment, one tank regiment, and a medium artillery regiment.|$|E

Peirse raised the Night Interception Unit at RAF Tangmere on 10 April 1940; it was later renamed the Fighter Interception Unit (FIU).|$|E

5|$|As {{an interim}} measure, 18 Royal Air Force Jaguars were loaned to the Indian Air Force, {{with the first}} two loaned {{aircraft}} operational with Western Air Command on 27July1979. The second batch of aircraft for the Indian Air Force were 40 Jaguar Internationals built at Warton, the first aircraft <b>being</b> <b>delivered</b> in March 1981.

5|$|Bjarne Sortland was {{appointed}} managing director. The first helicopter was delivered in May, {{with a new}} helicopter <b>being</b> <b>delivered</b> each month. They were named Havsulen, Havhesten, Havørn and Havsvale. Owner Bjørn G. Braathen stated that his goal was that the airline would reach a 50% market share. In 1990, another challenger, Mørefly, had also established themselves in the market. For the start of operations, Braathens Helikopter hired 22 pilots, most of them previously working for the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The company had 70 employees in total. Services started on 1 September 1990, where the initial contract involved flying 10,000 passengers per year.|$|E

5|$|The first {{component}} of the space station was the Zarya module, which was launched unmanned in November 1998. Following this launch, and prior to Expedition 1, there were five manned Space Shuttle flights and two unmanned Russian flights to the ISS. Some of these flights delivered large modules, such as the pressurized Unity and Zvezda modules, and {{the first piece of}} the Integrated Truss Structure. The manned flights were used for partial assembly of the ISS, as well as to start unpacking the supplies and equipment that were <b>being</b> <b>delivered.</b> Prior to Expedition 1, Krikalev expected the ISS to be very similar to his experience on Mir ten years previous, due to the physical similarities of the stations' components.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the Valiant fleet because of metal fatigue in December 1964 meant that the RAF had no front line tanker aircraft, so the B.1/1A aircraft, now judged to be surplus in the strategic bomber role, were refitted for this duty. To get some tankers into service as quickly as possible, six B.1A aircraft were converted to B(K).1A standard (later redesignated B.1A (K2P)), receiving a two-point system with a hose and drogue carried under each wing, while the bomb bay remained available for weapons. Handley Page worked day and night to convert these six aircraft, with the first <b>being</b> <b>delivered</b> on 28 April 1965, and 55 Squadron becoming operational in the tanker role in August 1965.|$|E
