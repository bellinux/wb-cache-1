500|$|... "The Juice Is Loose" [...] is {{the ninth}} {{episode of the}} seventh season of the American {{animated}} television series Family Guy. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on March 15, 2009. In the episode, Peter cashes in an old raffle ticket from 1989 and wins a golf outing with O. J. Simpson. When he befriends Simpson and brings him home to meet the family, the residents of Quahog are not as welcoming of the infamous running <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> force him out of town.|$|E
500|$|After half time, Dortmund {{were handed}} a {{way back into}} the match when Márcio Amoroso was brought down by Patrick Paauwe. Paauwe was spared Kohler's fate as he only {{received}} a yellow card. Amoroso scored the following penalty and the score was 2–1. Two minutes later, Amoroso was cautioned for diving in an attempt to win another spot kick. Just three minutes after Dortmund scored, Jon Dahl Tomasson who was playing his last game for Feyenoord before his move to Milan, [...] scored after beating the offside trap, and being put through by Shinji Ono. Dortmund once again found a {{way back into the}} match when Jan Koller volleyed home his shot from 25 metres on 58 minutes, after capitalizing on a weak defensive header. [...] Dortmund now assumed the ascendancy with attack after attack, whilst Feyenoord seemed content to sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> see the game out. Dortmund tried everything to find the equaliser replacing Lars Ricken with Jörg Heinrich, and Ewerthon was replaced by Otto Addo, however it was to no avail as Feyenoord saw the game out to win 3–2 and continue their streak of never losing a European final.|$|E

5000|$|After the 2007 Orange Bowl, Brohm {{stated that}} [...] "Right now, coming <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> win a {{national}} title looks very appealing."Rivals.com named Brohm {{as one of the}} top 10 quarterbacks going into the 2007 season.|$|R
2500|$|... "Get Along" [...] {{deals with}} the damage inflicted by religious, racial and {{cultural}} intolerance, asking why the world can't just get along. It is a stripped back track with minimal instrumental accompaniment. Sebastian explained why he wrote the song, [...] "It sends your brain into overload when you are expecting your first child. It definitely makes you take a step <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> gain some perspective on this world we live in". [...] "Big Bad World" [...] was written for his son Hudson {{who was born in}} March 2012. He said, [...] "It's about that promise we all make to our kids, but realise we don't have as much control as we think. We want to protect them from the big bad world, but the promise matters the most." [...] "Used to You" [...] is a song Sebastian wrote for his wife Jules. He said, [...] "I always say to her, 'I don't get used to you'. I still get back from tours and I'm still excited to see her. [...] We've been friends for 18 years, together for 13 years. I'm lucky".|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] murmured Jessy, [...] "you are {{the kind}} we don't mind taking in. The others go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> forget us, or abuse us. But you haven't given me very much {{information}} yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Betts, {{not more}} than a day or so. Now, do not look so distressed. I do not go back as a prisoner. Myeerah and I can often come and visit you. But just now I want to get <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> prevent the Delawares from urging Tarhe to war." ...|$|E
60|$|Amyas was unjust in {{his last}} words. Don Guzman, as if by miracle, had been only {{slightly}} wounded; and seeing his men run, had rushed <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> rally them, but was borne away by the fugitives.|$|R
60|$|Billy complied, {{touching}} {{the point of}} her chin with his knuckles. With both {{her hands on his}} arm, she shored it <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> draw it forward sharply in similitude of a punch. But Billy withstrained her.|$|R

6000|$|... "It's possible. All the same, I haven't tried {{my power}} and don't trust myself. Dick and I would jar, and when I couldn't move him I expect I'd get savage and {{turn down the}} job. When I have done some useful work, for example, cleared a ranch, got {{confidence}} and know my strength, I'll go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> take my proper part." ...|$|E
60|$|But having again {{cleared my}} {{conscience}} of my merely political and possibly unpopular opinion, I will again cast <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> treat {{the matter in}} a slower and more sympathetic style; attempt to trace the real roots of woman's position in the western state, and the causes of our existing traditions or perhaps prejudices upon the point. And for this purpose it is again necessary to travel far from the modern topic, the mere Suffragette of today, and {{to go back to}} subjects which, though much more old, are, I think, considerably more fresh.|$|E
60|$|The {{next moment}} {{they were gone}} round the corner, and he was left {{standing}} before the provision man's, with his packages in his hand. It {{did not come to}} him till he had transacted his business within, and was on his way home, that he had been very impolite not to ask if he might not see them home. He did not know but he ought to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find them, and apologise for his rudeness, and yet he did not see how he could do that, either; he had no excuse for it; he was afraid it would seem queer, and make them laugh. Besides, he had those things for Miss Vane, and the cook wanted some of them at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, mother," [...] said Dickory, [...] "I shall {{fight for}} her; I shall show her that I am worthier {{than he is}} and that I love her better. I shall even strive for her if that mad pirate comes <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> overset everything." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{was still}} saying it, over and over,--demanding, entreating, threatening, {{to know if}} it wanted any more,--when he felt the fellows of his gang laying hands on him, patting him on the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> put his coat on him. And then came a sudden rush of {{blackness}} and oblivion.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{curse of}} New York,' he said, mournfully, 'is the way {{everything}} changes in it. You can't take your eyes off {{it for a}} minute. The population's always shifting. It's like a railway station. You go away for a bit and come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find your old pals, and they're all gone: Ike's in Arizona, Mike's in a sanatorium, Spike's in jail, and nobody seems {{to know where the}} rest of them have got to. I came up from the country two days ago, expecting to find the old gang along Broadway the same as ever, and I'm dashed if I've been able to put my hands on one of them! Not a single, solitary one of them! And it's only six months since I was here last.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, dear. You {{must have}} seen last night; that's impossible. Please don't argue about it now; I'm too tired. I {{just wanted to tell}} you I appreciated--And when you get back to America you won't be any the worse for playing around with poor Istra because she told you about {{different}} things from what you've played with, about rearing children as individuals and painting in tempera and all those things? And--and I don't want you to get too fond of me, because we're--different.... But we have had an adventure, even if it was a little moist." [...] She paused; then, cheerily: [...] "Well, I'm going to beat it <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> sleep again. Good-by, Mouse dear. No, don't come back to the Cara-advanced-serai. Play around and see the animiles. G'-by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} Abdool got away safely. I {{think that if}} he did, he was likely, when he had once shaken off pursuit, to come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find out {{what had become of}} me. His face could not have been {{particularly}} noticed, for I expect the troopers were attacked as soon as I entered that scoundrel's house; and if he took off his uniform, and went in in native dress, there would be little chance of his being recognized. When he finds out where I have been taken, he will no doubt go back to Delhi, and report; but with Holkar within two miles, they have too much on their hands to think of sending to demand my release. If Holkar fails to take the place, and retires as Lake approaches, there will no doubt be a hot pursuit; and certainly they could not send two or three hundred men here. Less than that would be of no good, whatever. The rajah has committed himself, by the murder of my troopers and, as he cannot hope for forgiveness, he would either fly to Oude, or else move in here with his force, with which he would think himself safe from anything short of an army.|$|E
5000|$|At first, Sam {{also does}} not believe that Dean is <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> attack him. After {{confirming}} that Dean is really back, the brothers hug and reunite. However, Sam swears that he did not bring Dean <b>back</b> from hell <b>and</b> states that he is upset because he [...] "was unable to save Dean".|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I {{went back}} to Babbicombe," [...] Jack continued, [...] "and, lest my heart should break for want of human sympathy, I confided every word of my terrible story to Elsie. Elsie can trust me; and Elsie {{believed}} me. Gradually, as you began to recover, I realised the soundness of your doctor's idea {{that you should be}} allowed to come back to yourself by re-education from the very beginning, without any too early intrusion of reminiscences from your previous life to confuse and disturb you. But I couldn't go on with my profession, all the same, while I waited. I couldn't attend as I ought to my patients' wants and ailments: I was too concentrated upon you: the strain was too great upon me. So I threw up my practice, came out to Canada, bought a bit of land, and began farming here, and seeing a few patients now and again locally, just to fill up my time with. I felt confident in the end you would recover and remember me. I felt confident you would come to yourself and marry me. But still, it was very long work waiting. Every month, Elsie got news indirectly from Minnie Moore or someone of your state of health; and I intended to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> see you as soon as ever you were in a condition to bear the shock of re-living your previous life again.|$|E

5000|$|Bowra {{had learned}} the value of verse during the First World War. Cyril Connolly wrote that Bowra [...] "saw human life as a tragedy in which great poets were the heroes who fought <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> give life a meaning".

5000|$|In 1885, {{about 40}} Boer {{families}} from the north-west of South Africa settled at Grootfontein.
