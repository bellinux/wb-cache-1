5|$|John Gosse Freeze {{gives the}} name Mud Creek as the east branch of Chillisquaque Creek in his 1888 book A History of Columbia County, Pennsylvania: From the Earliest Times, <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> that the creek's name is more {{correctly}} the East Branch of the Chillisquaque. Mud Creek {{is named for}} its muddiness, which is especially pronounced following storms.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 the State Historic Preservation Board {{considered}} a boundary adjustment that removes {{a small area}} at the northeast corner <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> far more, primarily at the southeast. It would include a total of 200 new contributing properties and extend the district's period of significance to 1978, {{to take into account}} the city's urban renewal era. Most of the new areas had been found to be consistent with those already included in the district or accidentally excluded when the district was originally designated. Two years later the National Park Service officially approved the expansion.|$|E
5|$|The film is both {{a parody}} and tribute {{to many of the}} science fiction and horror movies from the 1930s up to the 1970s. The film {{production}} retains many aspects from the stage version such as production design and music, <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> new scenes not featured in the original stage play. The film's plot, setting, and style echo those of the Hammer Horror films, which had their own instantly recognizable style (just as Universal Studios' horror films did). The originally proposed opening sequence was to contain clips of various films mentioned in the lyrics, as well as the first few sequences shot in black and white, but this was deemed too expensive and scrapped.|$|E

5|$|The four {{difficulty}} {{levels for}} each song afford the player a learning curve {{in order to}} help him or her progress in skill. The first difficulty level, Easy, only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced amount of notes for the player to play. Medium introduces a fourth fret button while adding more notes, and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes. Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn, <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player.|$|E
5|$|The second idea {{means that}} {{processes}} can offer their services to other processes by providing virtual files {{that appear in}} the other processes' namespace. The client process's input/output on such a file becomes inter-process communication between the two processes. This way, Plan 9 generalizes the Unix notion of the filesystem as the central point of access to computing resources. It carries over Unix's idea of device files {{to provide access to}} peripheral devices (mice, removable media, etc.) and the possibility to mount filesystems residing on physically distinct filesystems into a hierarchical namespace, <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> the possibility to mount a connection to a server program that speaks a standardized protocol and treat its services as part of the namespace.|$|E
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both The Colbert Report and The Daily Show {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and The Daily Show viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that The Daily Show comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E

5|$|Suspension bridge using iron chains: Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that many early cultures employed the use of suspension bridges with cabled ropes, the first written evidence of iron chain suspension bridges comes from a local history and topography of Yunnan written in the 15th century, which describes the repair of an iron chain bridge during the reign of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424); although it is questionable if Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) Chinese claims that iron chain suspension bridges existed since the Han Dynasty, their existence in the 15th century predates that of anywhere else. K.S. Tom mentions this same repaired Ming suspension bridge described by Needham, <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> that recent research has revealed a document which lists the names of those who allegedly built an iron chain suspension bridge in Yunnan around the year 600 AD.|$|E
5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E
5|$|The four {{difficulty}} {{levels for}} each song afford the player a learning curve {{in order to}} help him/her progress in skill. The first difficulty level, Easy, only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced number of notes for the player to play. Medium introduces the fourth (blue) fret button, and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes. The addition of the orange fret button forces players to move their fingers up and down the neck. Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn, <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player and to simulate the player's hands to move in a sequence similar to a real guitar. A difficulty added in World Tour is Beginner, which only requires the player to strum to the basic rhythm; holding the fret buttons becomes unnecessary. Another new difficulty only for drums was added to Metallica known as Expert+, which uses the double bass pedal.|$|E

25|$|The Tongyong Pinyin {{system also}} {{exists in a}} Taiwanese Hokkien phonetic symbol version, Daighi tongiong pingim, which lacks f <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> bh. However, in 2006, the Ministry of Education {{rejected}} the use of Daighi tongiong pingim for the Taiwanese dialect and preferred the Taiwanese Romanization System.|$|E
25|$|A more {{sophisticated}} system of evaluating petroleum accumulations was adopted in 2007 by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), World Petroleum Council (WPC), American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG), and Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (SPEE). It incorporates the 1997 definitions for reserves, <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> categories for contingent resources and prospective resources.|$|E

25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{aspect of}} the song is {{the timing of the}} lead-up to the famous guitar solo. While staying in 4/4 throughout this section, most of the accents shift to the eighth notes. This makes the rhythm figure challenging for some musicians, <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> a feeling of anticipation to the approaching guitar solo.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps are a {{non-linear}} {{load and}} generate harmonic currents in the electrical power supply. The arc within the lamp may generate radio frequency noise, {{which can be}} conducted through power wiring. Suppression of radio interference is possible. Very good suppression is possible, <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> {{to the cost of}} the fluorescent fixtures.|$|E
25|$|Spring Landscape {{features}} {{a full moon}} shining above a solitary cherry tree in full bloom planted on the slope of a mountain. It retains the monochrome style with its refined Chinese associations, <b>but</b> <b>adds</b> sparing use of colour in the slight pink of the cherry blossoms, symbolic of spring, of transience and of Japan itself.|$|E
