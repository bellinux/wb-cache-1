50|$|On September 27, 2012, Goggins {{went on the}} Today Show {{to attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> world <b>record</b> for <b>the</b> most pull-ups done in 24 hours. The main aim of the {{challenge}} was {{to raise money for}} the Special Operations Warrior Foundation. After 6 hours and 30 minutes in, David had completed 2011 pullups (halfway <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>record).</b> By 9:15 pm, after 13.5 hours David completed pull-up 2588. He had been in considerable pain for hours as a severe bulge burst through the skin of his right wrist. A medical x-ray at 10:30pm confirmed a right extensor polycis complex partial tear. The reason for the injury and the failure in the attempt is thought to be the David's use of a portable pull-up bar that was not bolted down, as opposed to the sturdier equipment he used during the months of training prior to this event. Despite not <b>beating</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> Goggins managed <b>to</b> raise more than $20,000 for his chosen charity.|$|R
60|$|To {{walk away}} {{would be the}} more exact term, for his {{favourite}} method of exorcising this lady was to rise {{from his chair and}} take a long walk with Grizel. Occasionally if she was occupied (and a number of duties our busy Grizel found to hand!) he walked alone, and he would not let himself brood. Someone had once walked from Thrums {{to the top of the}} Law and back in three hours, and Tommy made several gamesome attempts <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> <b>record,</b> setting out <b>to</b> escape that willowy woman, soon walking her down and returning in a glow of animal spirits.
