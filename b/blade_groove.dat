40|$|Abstract. Blade {{roots and}} <b>blade</b> {{attachment}} <b>grooves</b> are highly stressed areas of steam turbine rotors. An unknown crack in blade roots or blade attachments {{can lead to}} a serious failure of the complete turbo generator set. Due to the high demand of power energy worldwide there is a strong demand to extend the calculated life of turbo generator sets. The extended operation cycle of turbines leads to the demand of advanced NDT methods, especially for highly stressed areas of turbine and generator rotors. The most critical ranges of a turbine rotor are the turbine blade roots as well as the turbine <b>blade</b> attachment <b>grooves.</b> The individual design of the turbine manufacturer require separate NDT methods for each blade root or blade attachment to be inspected. Phased Array Ultrasonic Inspection offers a reliable inspection without dismantling the parts for inspection. This paper describes examples of development of new Phased Array probes and the qualification of the inspection techniques for selected application in steam turbine field-service. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a volute angle of scroll casing and a groove on the suction surface of blades were {{investigated}} relating to the characteristics of aerodynamics and noise of a multi-blade centrifugal fan with forward swept blades. It was shown that in the aerodynamic characteristics, the optimal volute angle existed between 4. 8 and 7. 2 degrees, and in the characteristics of noise, {{that existed in the}} near 7. 2 degrees. The wake width of <b>grooved</b> <b>blade</b> fan became narrower than that of the ordinary blade fan. Therefore, the <b>grooved</b> <b>blade</b> fan was superior in noise characteristics to the ordinary blade fan. Using the method of predicting width of wake and the formulae to estimate the turbulent noise level which we proposed in this paper, the sound pressure level can be predicted with the accuracy of about ± 3 dB within these experiments...|$|R

Use of this device in our laboratory {{during the summer}} has proven highly satisfactory {{and at the same}} time it suggested to us the idea of using the same principle for keeping the knife blade cool while cutting. Accordingly, a copper box was made 12 x 6 x 4 inches, as shown in the accompanying figure. A suitable lid should be made from the same material. On the back of this box was soldered a narrow strip of copper, which was allowed to project approximately seven inches beyond the end of the box. This projecting strip should be just wide enough to fit into the groove on the back of the blade holder of the microtome, which happens to be just one-half inch in the case of the blade holder used in our laboratory. It should be soldered to the back of the box just high enough from the bottom to permit it to slide easily into the <b>blade</b> holder <b>groove</b> when the holder is in place on the microtome.

The upstream groove was located at the casing wall of the suction pipe and the downstream groove was located at the shroud casing wall near {{the leading edge of}} the splitter <b>blades,</b> where both <b>grooves</b> were connected by an annular bypass. According to the numerical results by using ANSYS-CFX, it becomes clear that the ring groove arrangement is effective for suppression of separation at the leading-edge of main blade even in small flow rates. The reverse flow zone on the shroud casing is sucked out from downstream groove and the flow incidence at the main blade leading edge is reduced successfully by about 5 degrees due to the increased incoming flow rate...|$|R

5000|$|The Yakutian knife (саха быһаҕа, якутский нож), {{sometimes}} called the Yakut knife, is traditional knife of Yakuts (an ethnic group from the Sakha Republic (or Yakutia), region of Siberia), used for working with wood, hides, skins, fish and meat. The knife {{has been used in}} Yakutia for hundreds of years without significant changes in its design. [...] Typical Yakutian knives have a blade length of 4 - 7 in, and 1 - 1+1⁄2 in wide. The unique feature of this knife is that the blade is asymmetrical; one side of the <b>blade</b> has a <b>groove</b> in it and a chisel grind, while the other side has no groove and is basically a convex edge (meaning it rounds down to the edge, rather than having a straight bevel).The blade is traditionally forged from locally sourced iron ore smelted by Yakutian blacksmiths. The knife handle is traditionally made from birch burl and is thick and egg-shaped in cross-section. It fits the hand and can also be used wearing gloves. The birch also protects the hand from the cold effects of the knife steel in extreme cold, a common condition in Siberia during winter months.

30|$|The first {{ultrasonic}} scalpel {{was introduced}} in 1991. Traditionally, the older shears such as the harmonic scalpel have applied longitudinal ultrasound waves down the shaft of the instruments. This invariably concentrates the energy {{at the tip of}} the instrument instead of between the blades, thereby reducing efficacy. The acronym LOTUS stands for laparoscopic operation by torsional ultrasound. The LOTUS shears (SRA Developments, Devon, UK) are the first ultrasonic scalpel to use torsional rather than longitudinal mode ultrasound to produce a cutting and haemostatic effect. They achieve focussed energy transmission into the target tissue; torsional waves are applied directly to the target tissues, thereby enhancing the efficacy of the shears. The torsional mode is a rotational oscillation whereby the tip (and equally spaced points along the waveguide) vibrates back and forth in a short arc around the waveguide axis. It is generated by applying a harmonic torque about the proximal end of the waveguide axis. The unique <b>blade</b> comprises two <b>grooves</b> side by side in the edge of the waveguide, at the distal end. The sides of the grooves are in fact planar, near-radial facets that lie normal to the direction of torsional vibration. Any tissue contacting these facets experiences a direct mechanical force. The waves cause denaturation of proteins by the breakage of hydrogen bonds in tissue, cutting and coagulating them with maximum efficiency.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} miles of portland cement {{concrete}} pavement in Iowa {{that due to}} normal wear, {{and in some cases}} accelerated wear from studded tires, the surface has become polished resulting in less than desirable friction values. Retexturing the surface may be an economical way to re-establish desirable friction values. Retexturing by grinding with diamond <b>blades</b> and transverse <b>grooving</b> with diamond <b>blades</b> are two methods of rehabilitating p. c. c. surfaces. MU Inc. of Lebanan, Tennessee proposed to provide without charge to the Iowa Department of Transportation, one 1500 ft x 12 ft section each of three methods of texturing. They are longitudinal grinding, transverse grooving and longitudinal grinding followed by transverse grooving. A section of 1500 feet is needed to properly evaluate a texturing method. It was decided by Iowa DOT personnel that due to possible differential friction it would be undesirable to texture only one lane. The decision was made to do test sections of 1500 ft x 24 ft with the cost of the additional texturing paid by the Iowa DOT. Iowa also has areas where the p. c. c. pavement has faulted at the joints and cracks which results in poor riding quality. Methods of correcting the faulting are to underseal the pavement where needed and/or grinding the surface to eliminate the faulted areas. It was decided to include in this research project a section for profiling by grinding...|$|R
40|$|Significant airport {{pavement}} {{research and}} development is being progressed {{around the world with}} the USA being the focal point of such efforts. This has led to a number of new and emerging technologies. There is a strong desire to improve the ability to predict pavement issues and failures prior to their occurrence. To support that desire, the ability to construct instrumented pavements has advanced significantly in recent years. It is now not only technically viable but is also becoming increasingly cost effective and allows the gathering of real time data from within pavement structures. There is also a desire for improved pavement analysis and design. It is expected that as each of the pavement system elements becomes better understood, finite element methods will be implemented to allow a broader range of potential failure modes to be considered by the designer. There has also been a significant increase in internal shear and other stresses in the airport's upper layers, which has led to shear creep type failures. This must be addressed by improved understanding of near-surface stresses and interface durability. In terms of runway friction, a <b>grooving</b> <b>blade</b> has recently been developed and patented in the USA to allow trapezoidal grooves to be cost effectively constructed.

40|$|SUMMARY: The self-etch {{approach}} provides dentists with {{a generation}} of user-friendly and less technique-sensitive adhesives. Nevertheless, some concern has been raised regarding their bonding effectiveness to enamel, in particular when so-called 'mild' self-etch adhesives are employed. OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that the two-step self-etch adhesive Clearfil SE Bond (C-SE; Kuraray, Osaka, Japan) bonds equally effective to enamel/dentin either with or without prior etching with phosphoric acid. METHODS: Bur-cut enamel/dentin surfaces prepared from human molars were partially split in two halves by cutting a shallow groove. One half was first etched with 40 % phosphoric acid (K-etchant), while protecting the other half by holding a razor <b>blade</b> in the <b>groove.</b> Next, C-SE was applied strictly following the manufacturer's instructions, after which the surface was built up using Z 100 (3 M Espe). After 24 -h water storage, micro-specimens were prepared with the interface circularly constricted using a Micro-Specimen Former, prior to micro-tensile bond strength (MPa) measurement. In addition, interfaces of C-SE with enamel/dentin prepared with and without beforehand acid etching were examined by Feg-SEM and TEM. RESULTS: Beforehand etching significantly increased the bonding effectiveness of C-SE to enamel. A clearly more micro-retentive surface was revealed by TEM and Feg-SEM when enamel was etched. Phosphoric-acid etching prior to C-SE application on dentin significantly decreased the muTBS to dentin. TEM provided indications of a low-quality hybrid layer after beforehand phosphoric-acid etching. CONCLUSION: Using C-SE, additional etching with phosphoric acid to improve bonding effectiveness should be limited to enamel. status: publishe...|$|R
