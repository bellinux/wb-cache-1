25|$|A barrel vault, {{also known}} as a tunnel vault or a wagon vault, is an {{architectural}} element formed by the extrusion of a single curve (or pair of curves, {{in the case of a}} pointed barrel vault) along a given distance. The curves are typically circular in shape, lending a semi-cylindrical appearance to the total design. The barrel vault is the simplest form of a vault: effectively a series of arches placed side by side (i.e., one after another). It is a form of <b>barrel</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
2500|$|St Peter's Church is a flint {{building}} {{dressed with}} stone {{and with a}} roof of tiles, standing in a prominent position next to Preston Manor on higher ground {{than the rest of}} Preston Village. [...] Built in the Early English style, it has a series of broad lancet windows—three {{on each side of the}} nave, and also in the chancel. [...] Most have been restored from their original state. [...] The tower at the west end is narrow and relatively short; it has much narrow lancet windows and contains three bells, one of which may be 15th-century. [...] In its present form, the church consists of a chancel with <b>barrel</b> <b>roof</b> and chamfered arch, nave with no aisles, vestry with an elaborate chimney, and a timber-framed, hipped-roofed porch. [...] Ewan Christian's renovations in 1878 added a set of intricately carved choir stalls; one of the carvings represents a Native American. [...] There are memorial tablets and stained glass windows commemorating members of the Stanford family. [...] A reredos was added after the 1907 restoration. [...] The altar is formed from a table-tomb—the burial place of Edward Eldrington (or Elrington), the lord of the Preston Manor who died in 1515.|$|E
60|$|Henchard {{returned}} to his house, had tea {{with his wife and}} daughter, and then walked out. It was now dusk. He soon saw that the tendency of all promenaders was towards a particular spot in the Walks, and eventually proceeded thither himself. The notes of a stringed band came from the enclosure that Farfrae had erected--the pavilion as he called it--and when the Mayor reached it he perceived that a gigantic tent had been ingeniously constructed without poles or ropes. The densest point of the avenue of sycamores had been selected, where the boughs made a closely interlaced vault overhead; to these boughs the canvas had been hung, and a <b>barrel</b> <b>roof</b> was the result. The end towards the wind was enclosed, the other end was open. Henchard went round and saw the interior.|$|E

Arches and <b>barrel</b> <b>roofs</b> are completely absent. Gable and eave curves are gentler than in China and columnar entasis (convexity at the center) limited.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the church}} is now deconsecrated and in private {{ownership}} {{the use of the}} site for worship goes make many years. There are references to the church in a 9th/10th century poem and was probably rebuilt by the Cistercians in the late 12th century. Much of what remains (particularly the saddleback west tower and the <b>barrel</b> <b>roofs)</b> suggests more rebuilding around 1500. Further refurbishment was completed in 1888-91.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} accuracy of computer programmes to simulate the illuminance level in atrium buildings compare to the measurement of those in physical models. The case was taken in atrium building with 4 types of roof i. e. pitched <b>roof,</b> <b>barrel</b> vault <b>roof,</b> monitor pitched roof (both monitor pitched <b>roof</b> and monitor <b>barrel</b> vault <b>roof),</b> and north light roof (both with north orientation and south orientation). The results show that both methods have agreement and disagreement. They show {{the same pattern of}} daylight distribution. In the other side, in terms of daylight factors, computer simulation tends to underestimate calculation compared to physical model measurement, while for average and minimum illumination, it tends to overestimate the calculation...|$|R
