It is only necessary that he should be able to refer to a fixed point of origin, when the form of the shaft was first perfected. But it may be incidentally observed, that if the Greeks did indeed receive their Doric from Egypt, then the three families of the earth have each contributed their part to its noblest architecture: and Ham, the servant of the others, furnishes the sustaining or <b>bearing</b> <b>member,</b> the shaft; Japheth the arch; Shem the spiritualisation of both.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of pullout tests on five {{different}} geosynthetics embedded in two different granular soils. Soil and geosynthetic properties are described and soil-geosynthetic interaction behaviour is studied. Based on {{the results of}} pullout tests, the influence of soil particle size, geosynthetic structure, and the role of geogrid <b>bearing</b> <b>members</b> are discussed. The main conclusion is that the influence of soil particle size on soil-geosynthetic interaction is important, but its significance depends on several factors. With geogrids, the relative sizes of soil particles and geogrid apertures, and the thickness of the geogrid <b>bearing</b> <b>members,</b> determine soil-geogrid interface shear resistance. A marked increase in soil-geogrid interface shear resistance was observed when the soil contained a significant percentage of particles with sizes slightly greater than the thickness of the geogrid <b>bearing</b> <b>members,</b> but smaller than the geogrid apertures. Tests, on geogrids in which the <b>bearing</b> <b>members</b> had been cut, show a significant decrease in soil-geogrid interface shear resistance. The influence of soil particle size is less important for geotextiles and geocomposites. Although the structure of geotextiles and geocomposites has an effect on soil-reinforcement interface behaviour, mobilised pullout resistance is also affected by the axial tensile stiffness of geotextiles and geocomposite...|$|R

50|$|Toyota {{introduced}} its Valvematic technology in 2008. Valvematic employs an intermediate shaft to achieve continuous variable valve lift. The intermediate shaft has an actuating member for each cylinder. Each actuating member {{is made of}} two finger followers {{on either side of}} a roller <b>bearing</b> <b>member.</b> The followers can rotate in relation to the roller member by means of internal gear threads and an electric motor attached {{to the end of the}} intermediate shaft. The gear threads of the roller member and finger followers are in opposing directions. This means when the shaft swivels, the roller member and finger followers will move in opposing directions, moving either apart or closer together. In this way, the axle angle between them can be varied infinitely by the electric motor. The intake valve is actuated by camshaft via the intermediate shaft. Specifically, the camshaft acts on the roller member of intermediate shaft, transferring the movement to both finger followers, then towards the roller rocker arms and ultimately to the intake valves. When the angle of the finger followers is narrow with respect to the roller member, valve lift is low. As the angle increases, so does valve lift. In this way, Valvematic can vary valve lift by adjusting the angle of the finger followers in relation to the roller <b>bearing</b> <b>member.</b>|$|E

The wonderful shapes,the smooth and gradual slidings,the underlying theme being anchored in the background,the music-all make Punt Formation a Visual treat for the audience. It takes place in dark, so generally it is the final or penultimate event. It consists of extremely stable boats, known as punts. These are usually wide {{at one end and}} somewhat narrow at the other. A single punt can accommodate up to 7 members. Participants are seated in a typical fashion in this event : the two 'big' tips at the wide end, a small 'tip' at the narrow end, and 3 or 4 middle members. The big tips are principally responsible for driving the boat, while small tip is responsible for directionally guiding the Punt. The middle members mainly assist in the activities after the shapes are formed.The edges of the Punts are illuminated with the 'NAWARs'(Traditional name for the Electric circuit). Small bulbs are fitted in the holders.A middle member is responsible for the switching of specific colours(generally 3 colours).The <b>bearing</b> <b>member</b> of a punt is the middlemost member, who provides direction to the other members (essentially small tips and big tips), about alignment of the boat in the right direction.

Also featured is a magnetic bearing having such an actuator. The actuator includes an inner member, a magnetic member and a pole assembly having a ring member and four pole extending therefrom. The poles are equi-angular spaced {{from each other and}} radially spaced about the Z-axis. The inner member extends along the Z-axis and is a highly magnetic permeable material. The magnetic member is formed about the inner member outer surface, extends along the Z-axis and is configured so one magnetic pole polarity is located at its outer surface and the other polarity pole is located at its inner surface. Preferably, the magnetic member is a radially magnetized permanent magnet. The inner surface of the ring member is magnetically coupled to the magnetic member and a face of each pole is coupled to the <b>bearing</b> <b>member.</b> The magnetic member, the pole assembly, the inner member and the <b>bearing</b> <b>member</b> cooperate to generate a magnetic field that radially and rotatably supports a rotating member secured to the <b>bearing</b> <b>member.</b> The actuator further includes a plurality of electromagnetic coils.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} of recertifying a loaded <b>bearing</b> <b>member</b> using ultrasound testing {{to compensate for}} different equipment configurations and temperature conditions. The standard frequency F 1 of a reference block is determined via an ultrasonic tone burst generated by a first pulsed phased locked loop (P 2 L 2) equipment configuration. Once a lock point number S is determined for F 1, the reference frequency F 1 a of the reference block is determined at this lock point number via a second P 2 L 2 equipment configuration to permit an equipment offset compensation factor Fo 1 =((F 1 -F 1 a) /F 1) (1000000) to be determined. Next, a reference frequency F 2 of the unloaded <b>bearing</b> <b>member</b> is determined using a second P 2 L 2 equipment configuration and is then compensated for equipment offset errors via the relationship F 2 +F 2 (Fo 1) / 1000000. A lock point number b is also determined for F 2. A resonant frequency F 3 is determined for the reference block using a third P 2 L 2 equipment configuration to determine a second offset compensation factor F 02 =((F 1 -F 3) /F 1) 1000000. Next the resonant frequency F 4 of the loaded <b>bearing</b> <b>member</b> is measured at lock point number b via the third P 2 L 2 equipment configuration and the bolt load determined by the relationship (- 1000000) CI(((F 2 -F 4) /F 2) -Fo 2), wherein CI is a factor correlating measured frequency shift to the applied load.

40|$|Disproportionate {{collapse}} {{occurs when}} the removal of load <b>bearing</b> <b>members</b> (one or more columns, or load bearing walls) results in localized structural damage which leads to further loss of load <b>bearing</b> <b>members</b> and, ultimately, {{to the collapse of}} whole or part of the structure. It is often necessary to design critical load bearing elements to resist the effects of blast if a structure is considered at risk from attack. This necessitates the estimation of blast load and its effects on load bearing elements. This paper discusses the assessment of blast load and its effect on building frames. It also briefly introduces a method for evaluating the strength of reinforced concrete structures, subjected to intense blast loading. As a case study, the Murrah Building collapse is considered, in which direct blast pressure resulted in the brisance failure of a column and the shearing of two columns. This local failure of load bearing elements resulted in a progressive collapse that destroyed half the floor area of the building, with the loss of 168 lives. This building frame reanalyzed without the use of a transfer girders that have been cited as partly responsible for the extent of the collapse...|$|R

40|$|Phagosomal {{transporters}} (Phts), {{required for}} intracellular growth of Legionella pneumophila, comprise a novel family of multispanning a-helical proteins within the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). The {{members of this}} family derive exclusively from bacteria. Multiple paralogues are present in a restricted group of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, but single members were also found in Chlamydia and Cyanobacteria. Their protein sequences were aligned, yielding a phylogenetic tree showing the relations of the proteins to each other. Topological analyses revealed a probable 12 a-helical transmembrane segment (TMS) topology. Motif identification and statistical analyses provided convincing evidence that these proteins arose from a six TMS precursor by intragenic duplication. The phylogenetic tree revealed some potential orthologous relationships, suggestive of common function. However, several probable examples of lateral transfer of the encoding genetic material between bacteria were identified and analysed. The Pht family most closely resembles a smaller MFS family (the UMF 9 family) with no functionally characterized members. However, the UMF 9 family occurs in {{a broader range of}} prokaryotic organism types, including Archaea. These two families differ in that organisms <b>bearing</b> <b>members</b> of the Pht family often have numerous paralogues, whereas organisms <b>bearing</b> <b>members</b> of the UMF 9 family never have more than two.

40|$|Disproportionate {{collapse}} {{occurs when}} the removal of load <b>bearing</b> <b>members</b> (one or more columns, or load bearing walls) causes localized structural damage which leads to further loss of load <b>bearing</b> <b>members</b> and, ultimately, {{to the collapse of}} whole or part of the structure. The accidental load, carried by the removed column can be transferred to nearby columns either by beam action or by catenary action. Simple connections such as fin plate, double angle web cleat and flexible end plate connections are routinely assumed to be com-pliant with the tying force design method, which aims to ensure that column loads are redistributed via cate-nary action in the event of damage. This is feasible only if the joints have sufficient ductility as well as tensile strength. Semi-rigid and rigid connections redistribute the column loads through beam action, provided that the connections have sufficient rotation capacity. This investigation demonstrates that the beam-column joints (simple and semi-rigid connections) in many designs have insufficient ductility to successfully bridge dam-aged columns. In simple (nominally pinned) connections, a couple can develop between beam flange and col-umn due to insufficient joint ductility. The resulting prying action is shown to cause early joint fracture and subsequently to lead to progressive failure. In semi-rigid connections, the beam remains elastic and the con-nections plastify, leading to early joint failure...|$|R
