40|$|Oral {{administration}} (3 mg/day) of thalidomide {{during the}} dedifferentiation and early limb-bud stages of newt forelimb regeneration produced {{a variety of}} specific limb deformities. Proximal and preaxial skeletal elements were the most severely malformed, e. g., preaxial hemimelia, severe proximal deformities, and preaxial polydactyly. Likewise, oral, daily doses (3 mg) of the teratogenic analogue, EM 12, on days 7 and 8 following <b>bilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> caused the same incidence and type of forelimb abnormalities as did thalidomide. Conversely, the non-teratogenic analogue, EM 87, when orally administered (3 mg/day) on days 7 and 8 post-amputation resulted in a low rate of limb deformities, similar in type to those seen in control regenerates. The type of limb deformities observed in the regenerating newt forelimb following thalido-mide treatment nearly mimic those seen in the human and monkey syndromes.

Case presentation We treated a 37 -year-old Chinese woman with bilateral lower limb crush injuries sustained in a traffic accident. Her lower limb injuries were at different anatomic levels. We performed emergency <b>bilateral</b> <b>amputations</b> followed by crossover replantation. Five years later, the woman had recovered well, and had perfect movement and stability in her replanted leg.

40|$|The {{results of}} below-knee amputations in 36 war wounded (mean age 35, 42) were reviewed. The {{majority}} of the patients was wounded by land mines (94. 4 %). Most of them were between 25 and 35 years old. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> was done in 2. 8 % of cases. The amputation {{was performed on the}} day of wounding (primary below-knee amputation) in 30 (83. 3 %) amputees. Secondary amputation after the attempt to save the severely injured lower-limb was performed in 6 patients (16, 7 %) average 4. 61 ± 11. 67 days after wounding. Reamputation was necessary in 6 cases (16. 7 %). Time period from the beginning of rehabilitation to the fitting of prosthesis, was 36. 25 ± 14. 97 days for primary amputations, 32 ± 17. 8 days for secondary amputations and 68. 66 ± 33. 52 days for reamputations.

40|$|Objective:To {{assess the}} quality of life after {{treatment}} for limb-threatening ischaemia. Design:An open, prospective, observational study in a Vascular Unit of a University Hospital. Materials:One hundred and fifty consecutive patients presenting with actual or threatened tissue loss of the leg. Methods:A single, experienced observer assessed the patients for pain, mobility, anxiety, depression, self-care and lifestyle at presentation, 6 and 12 months later. Results:Six different treatment outcomes were recognised: successful angioplasty, successful thrombolysis/thrombectomy, successful surgical bypass, amputation after failed revascularisation, primary unilateral amputation and primary <b>bilateral</b> <b>amputation.</b> Pain was significantly improved in all groups (p< 0. 05) except for patients after failed revascularization (p = 0. 08). Mobility improved in patients who underwent angioplasty (p = 0. 05) or a successful surgical bypass (p = 0. 001). Anxiety and depression both improved significantly only after surgical reconstruction (p< 0. 02). Self-care ability improved significantly after angioplasty (p< 0. 05), surgical reconstruction (p< 0. 005) and unilateral primary amputation (p< 0. 05), but was unaltered in the other groups. Lifestyle significantly deteriorated following thrombolysis/thrombectomy and failed surgical reconstruction (p< 0. 05), but was maintained in all other groups. Conclusions:The treatment of limb-threatening ischaemia should aim to maintain pre-morbid lifestyle, an aim which is best achieved by limb-salvage.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Objective of {{this study}} was to analyze fifteen months after surgery the {{sensorimotor}} recovery of the first human double hand transplantation. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: As for any organ transplantation the success of composite tissue allografts such as a double hand allograft depends on prevention of rejection and its functional recovery. METHODS: The recipient was a 33 -year-old man with <b>bilateral</b> <b>amputation.</b> Surgery included procurement of the upper extremities from a multiorgan cadaveric donor, preparation of the graft and recipient's stumps; then, bone fixation, arterial and venous anastomoses, nerve sutures, joining of tendons and muscles and skin closure. Rehabilitation program included physiotherapy, electrostimulation and occupational therapy. Immunosuppressive protocol included tacrolimus, prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil and, for induction, antithymocyte globulins and then CD 25 monoclonal antibody were added. Sensorimotor recovery tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were performed to assess functional return and cortical reorganization. All the results were classified according to Ipsen's classification. RESULTS: No surgical complications occurred. Two episodes of skin acute rejection characterized by maculopapular lesions were completely reversed increasing steroid dose within 10 days. By fifteen months the sensorimotor recovery was encouraging and the life quality improved. fMRI showed that cortical hand representation progressively shifted from lateral to medial region in the motor cortex. CONCLUSION: Even though at present this double hand allograft, treated using a conventional immunosuppression, allowed to obtain results at least as good as those achieved in replanted upper extremities, longer follow-up will be necessary to demonstrate the final functional restoration...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the construct validity}} and test-retest reliability of the Walking Questionnaire, a patient-reported measure of activity limitations in walking in people with a lower limb amputation. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Outpatient department of a rehabilitation center. Participants: People with a lower limb amputation (N = 172; mean age +/- SD, 65 +/- 12 y; 71 % men; 82 % vascular cause) participated in the study, 33 of whom also participated in the reliability study. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Construct validity was investigated by testing 11 hypotheses: limitations in walking according to the Walking Questionnaire will be greater in people with a lower limb amputation who (1) are older, (2) have a <b>bilateral</b> <b>amputation,</b> (3) have {{a higher level of}} amputation, (4) underwent their rehabilitation treatment in a nursing home, (5) walk less (in terms of time), and (6) walk shorter distances. Furthermore, limitations in walking will be positively related to activity limitations according to the (7) Locomotor Capabilities index, (8) "distance walked" question on the Prosthetic Profile of the Amputee Questionnaire, (9) Questionnaire Rising and Sitting Down, (10) Climbing Stairs Questionnaire, and (II) Special Interest Group on Amputation Medicine/Dutch Working Group on Amputations and Prosthetics mobility scale. Construct validity was quantified by using the Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlation coefficient. Test-retest reliability was assessed with a 3 -week interval and quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: Construct validity (10 of 11 hypotheses not rejected) and test-retest reliability were good (intraclass correlation coefficient =. 73; 95 % confidence interval,. 43 -. 88). Conclusions: The Walking Questionnaire has good construct validity and test-retest reliability in people with a lower limb amputation.

40|$|Multiple {{levels of}} aortoileofemoral {{occlusive}} disease may necessitate profundoplasty or {{extension of the}} outflow anastomosis to insure pelvic and distal arterial perfusion. During the period 1978 through 1988, 1637 patients underwent elective aortic reconstruction for aneurysmal or occlusive disease. One hundred forty-five had profundoplasty performed to ensure adequate outflow. Associated disease was common with 88 (60 %) patients having arteriosclerotic heart disease and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) present in 89 (61 %) patients. Hypertension and extracranial occlusive disease was found in 68 (46 %) and 56 (38 %) patients, respectively. The superficial femoral artery was occluded in 108 (74 %) patients, while in 17 (12 %) the profunda femoris was the only patent artery in the groin. Death occurred in nine patients (6. 2 %). Three were due to arrhythmias or myocardial infarction and ischemic colitis was the cause of death in two. Renal failure, sepsis, aspiration and cerebral anoxia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy accounted for one each. Five graft limbs failed. Amputation was required in one patient, while thrombectomy or distal bypass restored flow in four patients. Seventeen graft limbs in 136 patients occluded during the follow-up period. Distal bypass was successful in four and amputation was required in the fifth patient.

To our knowledge, {{there has been little}} evidence reporting the impact of different surgical decisions on functional and mental health outcomes following intensive rehabilitation that might inform decision-making. Methods: This study is a retrospective, independent-group comparison of rehabilitation outcomes from a U. K. military complex trauma rehabilitation center. There were 100 procedures examined: 36 unilateral amputations (11 immediatebelow- the-knee amputations, 15 delayed below-the-knee amputations, and 10 immediate above-the-knee amputations), 43 bilateral amputations, and 21 single-limb salvages (including 13 below-the-knee limb salvages); the patients had a mean age (and standard deviation) of 29 ± 6 years and a mean New Injury Severity Score of 34 ± 15 points. The outcome measures at completion of rehabilitation included a 6 -minute walk test (6 MWT), Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre mobility and activities of daily living scores, screening for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ- 9]) and general anxiety disorder (General Anxiety Disorder 7 -item scale [GAD- 7]), mental health support, and pain scores. Results: On completion of their rehabilitation, the unilateral amputation group walked significantly farther in 6 minutes (564 ± 92 m) than the limb-salvage group (483 ± 108 m; p 0. 05). The limb-salvage group was less capable of running independently compared with all amputee groups. No significant differences (p > 0. 05) were reported in mean mental health outcomes between the below-the-knee injury groups, and depression and anxiety scores were comparable with population norms. At discharge, 97 % of all patients were able to control their pain. Conclusions: After completing a U. K. military interdisciplinary rehabilitation program, the unilateral amputation group demonstrated a significant functional advantage over the limb-salvage and <b>bilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> groups. We found that patients electing for delayed amputation below the knee after attempted limb salvage achieved superior functional gains in mobility compared with patients who underwent limb salvage below the knee and experienced no functional disadvantage compared with patients who underwent immediate amputation. The mental health outcomes were comparable with general population norms, optimizing the prospect of full integration back into society...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesIn {{spite of}} {{recommendations}} advocating conservative best medical treatment, many patients with infrainguinal intermittent claudication (IC) are treated by invasive open and endovascular methods. This study aims {{to evaluate the}} incidence and 1 -year results of all such treatments during 2009 in Sweden. MethodsThe design was a one-year follow-up through the Swedish Vascular Registry (Swedvasc) of all 775 patients from the Swedish population of 10 million inhabitants in whom 843 invasive infrainguinal procedures (796 index procedures and 47 secondary procedures) were performed for IC in 2009. Index procedures were open surgery in 290 (37 %) patients, bilateral in nine cases, giving a total of 299 limbs, endovascular treatment in 447 (58 %) patients, bilateral in 10, giving a total of 457 limbs, and hybrid treatment in 38 (5 %) patients, bilateral in two cases, giving a total of 40 limbs. Data were analysed both {{with regard to the}} number of patients (775) and the number of procedures (843). Clinical outcome was calculated from patient-reported leg function (unchanged, improved, deteriorated) and whether amputation had been necessary or death had occurred. Patent reconstruction at 1 year was also counted as improvement. ResultsImprovement at 1 year was seen in 567 (73. 2 %) patients, (225 [77. 6 %] in the open surgery group, 320 [71. 6 %] in the endovascular treatment group, and 22 [57. 9 %] in the hybrid treatment group). No significant difference was found between the open surgery and endovascular treatment groups comprising 737 / 775 patients (p = . 350). Hybrid treatment gave significantly worse results (p = . 046). Fifty-seven (7. 3 %) patients reported unchanged limb function and 32 (4. 1 %) patients reported deterioration. Within 30 days two patients died and one patient underwent amputation. Within 1 year 10 patients underwent 11 amputations: five (1. 7 %) in the open surgery group, three (0. 6 %) in the endovascular treatment group, and two (7. 5 %) in the hybrid treatment group; one underwent <b>bilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> (p = . 07). Twenty-two patients died: 10 (3. 4 %) in the open surgery group, 12 (2. 7 %) in the endovascular treatment group and none in the hybrid treatment group (p = . 465). ConclusionsReported improvement at 1 year was 73. 2 % in patients invasively treated for infrainguinal IC.

40|$|Background: Adipose-derived stromal {{vascular}} fraction (ADSVF) can {{be applied}} to repair tendon and ligament tears. ADSVF treatment has a better therapeutic potential than adipose stem cells alone in promoting the healing of connective tissue injury in rabbit models. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biomechanical testing were used in this study to evaluate the efficiency of SVF in the healing of tendon-bone interface of a rotator cuff injury after reattachment. Methods: A total of 36 rabbits were studied between March and June 2016, 18 rabbits received the SVF-fibrin glue (SVF-FG) treatment and the other 18 formed the control group. ADSVF was isolated from each rabbit. A <b>bilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> of the supraspinatus tendon and parallel reconstruction was also performed on all the 36 rabbits. Then, a mixture of SVF and FG was injected into the tendon-bone interface of the SVF-FG group, whereas the control group only received FG. The animals were randomly sacrificed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery (n = 6 per group), respectively. The shoulders were prepared for MRI scanning and analysis of biomechanical properties. Analyses of variance were performed using SPSS 13. 0. Results: MRI scanning showed that the signal-to-noise quotient of the SVF-FG group was not significantly higher than that of the control group at either 4 (20. 1 ± 3. 6 vs. 18. 2 ± 3. 4, F = 1. 570, P = 0. 232) or 8 weeks (20. 7 ± 3. 3 vs. 18. 0 ± 3. 0, F = 2. 162, P = 0. 117) posttreatment, and only became significant after 12 weeks (27. 5 ± 4. 6 vs. 22. 1 ± 1. 9, F = 4. 968, P = 0. 009). Biomechanical properties such as the maximum load, maximum strength, and the stiffness for the SVF-FG group were significantly greater than that for the control group at 8 weeks' posttreatment (maximum load: 166. 89 ± 11. 62 N vs. 99. 40 ± 5. 70 N, P < 0. 001; maximum strength: 8. 22 ± 1. 90 N/mm vs. 5. 82 ± 0. 68 N/mm, P < 0. 010; and the stiffness: 34. 85 ± 3. 00 Pa vs. 24. 57 ± 5. 72 Pa, P < 0. 010).

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTo {{assess the}} 5 -year and 10 -year {{survival}} rates of major (above ankle disarticulation level) dysvascular lower limb amputees attending a sub-regional Disablement Services Centre (DSC) specialising in amputee rehabilitation. Also {{to investigate the}} association between survival rates, cause of dysvascularity, level of amputation, smoking status and occupational status. SettingThe study was undertaken in sub-regional DSC for amputee rehabilitation covering a base population of about 3. 5 million people. Over 80 % of lower limb amputations were done for dysvascularity (peripheral vascular disease, diabetic or combination). All these patients were followed up in the DSC for their prosthetic/amputee rehabilitation. Modular case records of 201 consecutive patients from 1994 to 1995 who had diagnosis of dysvascularity {{as the cause of}} major lower limb amputations, were scrutinised regarding their 10 -year survival; demographic details, level of lower limb amputations, Above Knee (AK=Transfemoral), Below Knee (BK=Transtibial), smoking status, occupational status, healing of the stump at first assessment, cause of amputation and association of these factors with survival rates. ResultsOf 201 individuals with either AK or BK amputations, 60 % (121) had AK amputations and 67 % (134) were males, the mean age was 69 years of age. Sixty-seven percent (97) had history of smoking, either current 43 % (62) or prior 24 % (35) smoking, and 59 % (68) were skilled or non-skilled manual workers. Fifty-one percent (99) had diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease, whilst 34 % (65) had combination of peripheral vascular disease and diabetes, diabetes on its own in 4 % (7). In 12 % (23) other causes were noted such as embolism, acute ischaemia, venous ulcers, etc. Regarding stumps healing at first assessment, healing was noted in 54 % (109) whilst stump was unhealed in 46 % (92). The median survival was 48 months. Using Cox proportional hazards regression to identify association with survival, the hazard ratio (HR) was significant regarding level of amputation: HR 2. 34; 95 % confidence interval (CI) (1. 58, 3. 47), P< 0. 001 (a recent BK amputation increases the risk by 2. 3 compared to a recent AK amputation in diabetic cohort and also in the peripheral vascular disease/diabetes cohort). Hazard ratio was less than 1. 0 in bilateral amputees: HR 0. 35, 95 % CI (0. 21, 0. 60), P< 0. 001 (<b>bilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> decreases risk by 0. 35). ConclusionOur study indicates that the median survival remains at 4 years, which is similar to the previously published evidence in the Finish study of 1998 and the earlier study from Scotland in 1992. Unlike the previous data, our study indicates that patients with BK amputations have a higher hazard ratio than the AK amputees, and an association with diabetes has poorer prognosis regarding survival...|$|E

(Physiotherapy)), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, 2009 Background: The {{impact of}} non-traumatic lower limb {{amputation}} on participant’s {{quality of life}} (QOL) is unknown. In an effort to provide better care for people with lower limb amputation, {{there is a need}} to first know the impact of this body changing operation on people’s quality of life. Aim of the study: To determine the impact of lower limb amputation on QOL in people in the Johannesburg metropolitan area during their reintegration to their society/community of origin. Objectives: 1. To establish the pre-operative and post-operative:  QOL of participants (including the feelings, experiences and impact of lower limb amputation during the time when they have returned home and to the community).  The functional status of participants.  Household economic and social status of these participants. 2. To establish factors influencing QOL. Methods: A longitudinal pre (amputation) test –post (amputation) test study utilized a combination of interviews to collect quantitative data and in-depth semistructured interviews to gather qualitative data. Consecutive sampling was used to draw participants (n= 73) for the interviews at the study sites pre-operatively. The three study sites were Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg General Hospital and Helen Joseph Hospital. Participants were then followed up three months later for post-operative interviews and key informants were selected for in-depth interviews (n= 12). Inclusion criteria: Participants were included if they were scheduled for first time unilateral (or <b>bilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> done at the same time) lower limb amputation. The participants were between the ages of 36 - 71 years. Exclusion criteria: Participants who had an amputation as a result of traumatic or congenital birth defects were excluded from the study. Participants with comorbidities that interfered with function pre-operatively were not included. Procedures: Ethics: Ethical clearance was obtained from the Committee for Research on Human Subjects at the University of the Witwatersrand and permission was obtained from the above hospitals. Participants gave consent before taking part in the study. Instrumentation: A demographic questionnaire, the EQ- 5 D, the Modified Household Economic and Social Status Index (HESSI), the Barthel Index (BI) and semi-structured in-depth interviews were used. Data collection: Participants were approached before the operation for their preoperative interviews using the above questionnaires and then followed up postoperatively using the same questionnaires and some were selected to participate in semi-structured in-depth interviews three months later.

The purpose, therefore, {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between a variety of preoperative clinical characteristics and postoperative functional outcomes in order to formulate treatment recommendations for patients requiring major lower limb amputation. MethodsFrom January 1998 through December 2003, 627 major limb amputations (37. 6 % below knee amputations, 4. 3 % through knee amputations, 34. 5 % above knee amputations, and 23. 6 % bilateral amputations) were performed on 553 patients. Their mean age was 63. 7 years; 55 % were men, 70. 2 % had diabetes mellitus, and 91. 5 % had peripheral vascular disease. A retrospective review was performed correlating various preoperative presenting factors such as age at presentation, race, medical comorbidities, preoperative ambulatory status, and preoperative independent living status, with postoperative functional endpoints of prosthetic usage, survival, maintenance of ambulation, and maintenance of independent living status. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed and compared by using the log-rank test. Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals were constructed by using multiple logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazards models. ResultsStatistically significant preoperative factors independently associated with not wearing a prosthesis in order of greatest to least risk were nonambulatory before amputation (OR, 9. 5), above knee amputation (OR, 4. 4), age > 60 years (OR, 2. 7), homebound but ambulatory status (OR, 3. 0), presence of dementia (OR, 2. 4), end-stage renal disease (OR, 2. 3), and coronary artery disease (OR, 2. 0). Statistically significant preoperative factors independently associated with death in decreasing order of influence included age ≥ 70 years (HR, 3. 1), age 60 to 69 (HR, 2. 5), and the presence of coronary artery disease (HR, 1. 5). Statistically significant preoperative factors independently associated with failure of ambulation in decreasing order of influence included age ≥ 70 years (HR, 2. 3), age 60 to 69 (HR, 1. 6), <b>bilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> (HR, 1. 8), and end-stage renal disease (HR, 1. 4). Statistically significant preoperative factors independently associated with failure to maintain independent living status in decreasing order of influence included age ≥ 70 years (HR, 4. 0), age 60 to 69 (HR, 2. 7), level of amputation (HR, 1. 8), homebound ambulatory status (HR, 1. 6), and the presence of dementia (HR, 1. 6). ConclusionsPatients with limited preoperative ambulatory ability, age ≥ 70, dementia, end-stage renal disease, and advanced coronary artery disease perform poorly and should probably be grouped with bedridden patients, who traditionally have been best served with a palliative above knee amputation. Conversely, younger healthy patients with below knee amputations achieved functional outcomes similar to what might be expected after successful lower extremity revascularization. Amputation in these instances should probably not be considered a failure of therapy but another treatment option capable of extending functionality and independent living...|$|E
40|$|We {{retrospectively}} reviewed 61 {{cases of}} <b>bilateral</b> lower limb <b>amputations</b> in patients {{admitted to a}} regional amputee rehabilitation program. Of the 61 cases, 41 were analyzed as to functional outcome on discharge, at 1 month, and at 3 months; 20 were not included owing to transfers to acute care or loss to follow-up. There were 41 men and 20 women, the average age was 61. 5 years, and 47 patients (77 %) were discharged to home. There were 25 bilateral below-knee, 14 above-knee and below-knee, 12 bilateral above-knee, 5 below-knee and partial-foot, 3 above-knee and partial-foot, and 2 <b>bilateral</b> partial-foot <b>amputations.</b> The average length of stay for all levels was 24. 2 days. Most of the patients {{at the time of}} discharge achieved a level of limited household walking with the exception of those with <b>bilateral</b> above-knee <b>amputations.</b> A significant improvement in function was noted for all patients at 3 -month follow-up, with most patients achieving household ambulation level, but 10 remained independent at wheelchair level for mobility...|$|R
40|$|Prosthetic {{rehabilitation}} {{of patients with}} severe contractures of the remaining joints of the affected lower extremity has been generally viewed as being difficult due to biomechanical problems in fitting, increased energy costs of ambulation and poor cosmesis of the prosthesis. As a result, attempts are often made to "stretch out the contracture " with minimal success, or suggestions are made to the patient {{to remain in the}} wheelchair. Our experiences with a number of patients who presented with "irreversible " contractures, indicate that another choice may be available. In 1965 (1) we reported our experience in the manage ment of a 59 year old man who had undergone <b>bilateral</b> <b>amputations</b> (BK and AK). Following a herniorrhaphy, he developed occlusions of both iliac arteries an...|$|R
