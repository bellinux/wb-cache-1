5|$|I've had to {{deal with}} some hard truths... People don't like to hear we've got only 18 percent of the electorate. They pretend it's not {{important}} that our following among blacks, and young people, and urban communities is not what it should be... <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> it's of the greatest importance that if there's to be a Republican Party, we look these facts in the face.|$|E
5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears to}} me that the {{developers}} have been completely indifferent to, or perhaps have even welcomed, this deterioration in the condition of the building, and have done virtually nothing to halt it. I feel the developers have shown a complete disregard for the moral obligations which arose from their course of dealing with the corporation or the planning applications; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> the corporation have also been extremely remiss to exercising whatever statutory powers were open to them to cope with the situation.|$|E

5000|$|One {{sample of}} his {{authentic}} jottings is this passage contributed {{by a man}} reporting for help at sick call. “Are you sick, soldier?” And the trooper says, “No sir, <b>I</b> ain't sick, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feels</b> powful unnecessary down around my mess kit.” ...|$|R

500|$|They [...] have a {{great deal}} of very precise data on words and the effects {{produced}} by words – a real science of communication. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that their presentation has been often deplorable and that as a science, a body of knowledge, it is definitely being vitiated by a dogmatic policy.|$|E
500|$|In August that year, Harrison {{set off for}} {{a driving}} holiday around Europe without Boyd, a trip that Huntley {{describes}} as [...] "the first publicly visible signs" [...] of problems in the Harrisons' marriage. While in Portugal, Harrison stayed with his musician friend Gary Wright, who, Huntley suggests, [...] "play the diplomat" [...] by telling the press: [...] "He's writing lots of new things {{and he seems to}} be having a good time... Sometimes he takes Pattie with him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> he just felt like a holiday and wanted to get away." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Dworkin {{published}} her autobiography, Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant. She {{soon began}} to speak and write again, and {{in an interview with}} Julie Bindel in 2004 said, [...] "I thought I was finished, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> a new vitality. I want to continue to help women." [...] She published three more articles in the Guardian and began work on a new book, Writing America: How Novelists Invented and Gendered a Nation, on the role of novelists such as Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner in the development of American political and cultural identity, which was left unfinished when she died.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah," [...] remarked Dick Moy, [...] "Irish mutton, I s'pose. Well, I don't know 'ow you <b>feels,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feels</b> {{so hungry}} that I could snap at a ring-bolt; and I {{know of a}} lot o' child'n, big an' small, as won't look sweet on their daddy if he keeps 'em waitin' for dinner, so come along, mates." ...|$|R
500|$|... "When I {{was first}} {{told about the}} storyline, I felt honoured to be given such a big opportunity. But I was also aware that I had a huge {{responsibility}} {{to get it right}} and do justice to those suffering in real life. [...] Because Sam has chemotherapy, I was asked if I'd be willing to shave off my hair, and I said, [...] "Absolutely," [...] which is why I'm bald. I've also done a lot of research, and try hard to separate my character from my life off-screen, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> guilty {{that at the end of}} each day I can walk away from the illness, when many aren't so fortunate." ...|$|E
500|$|CBC Sports head of {{programming}} Trevor Pilling {{explained that the}} large number of events being held, along with the stature of the Pan American Games in comparison to the Olympics, were a factor in the structure of CBC's coverage, stating that [...] "I do think we are the victim of our own success in that having Olympic coverage that is around the clock, but the Olympics are a different event than these Pan Am Games. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like we've done the athletes justice by telling those stories or through live coverage, or with reporters on site. We've tried to make sure we're at all the significant events, and with Canada winning over 180 medals, that's a tall task." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Walton {{became aware of}} a younger English {{composer}} whose fame was shortly to overtake his, Benjamin Britten. After their first meeting, Britten wrote in his diary, [...] " [...] to lunch with William Walton at Sloane Square. He is charming, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> always the school relationship with him – he is so obviously the head prefect of English music, whereas I'm the promising new boy." [...] They remained on friendly terms {{for the rest of}} Britten's life; Walton admired many of Britten's works, and considered him a genius; Britten did not admire all of Walton's works but was grateful for his support at difficult times in his life.|$|E

500|$|... "August" [...] was co-written by co-showrunners J. H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, {{while being}} {{directed}} by NCIS veteran Dennis Smith. They began shooting the episode {{during the second}} half of September 2009, right after wrapping production on [...] "Of Human Action". Supervising producer Josh Singer later noted how [...] "August" [...] helped them write the rest of the season, [...] "There was one episode, 'August', which was all about the Observers, that I feel was mythology without being mythology. And somehow, in working that episode, we sort of found a new creative vein. And it's not that that episode was necessarily so related to everything else we did. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like it sort of opened us up in terms of how we were feeling about the year".|$|E
500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both of our other records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you know, that people can look at and go, 'OK, that's who that is.' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like, by now, they know who we are, and I wanted something really different. I didn't feel like {{we had to put}} a photo on the cover, I wanted it to be more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E
500|$|Music {{journalist}} Sarah Champion {{pointed out}} (prior to the million pound fire) that, [...] "Being 'in the money' doesn't mean they'll ever be rich. [...] always be , but their pranks {{will get more}} extravagant. If they earned £10 million, they'd blow it all by buying Jura or a fleet of K Foundation airships or a Van Gogh to be ceremonially burned." [...] "There are things we'd like to do which we haven't done.", Drummond told a journalist in 1991. [...] "Totally ludicrous things. We want to buy ships, have submarines. They really are stupid things I know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> confident that {{in the event of}} us selling ten million albums we would definitely {{go out and buy a}} submarine....Just to be able to say 'Look we've got a submarine and 808 State haven't'." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout 2016, PewDiePie's video style change {{became more}} {{apparent}} than the tweaks he implemented in the past (see above for more). As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like back then I didn't understand. I was so immature and I just thought things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm not proud of it. I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I think {{the thing is that}} I have a lot of younger audience , and I think my humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E
500|$|James Berardinelli {{gave the}} film 2 stars out of 4, calling it [...] "the most lifeless of the series" [...] and [...] "simply [...] {{a very good}} motion picture." [...] Margaret Pomeranz of At the Movies gave the film 2 1/2 stars out of 5, saying that the filmmakers [...] "had 19 years since the last Indiana Jones movie {{to come up with}} {{something}} truly exciting and fresh, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> there's a certain laziness and cynicism in this latest adventure." [...] Associated Press reported that J. Sperling Reich, who writes for FilmStew.com, said: [...] "It really looked like they were going through the motions. It really looked like no one had their heart in it." [...] USA Today stated reviews were [...] "mixed" [...] and reviewers felt the [...] "movie suffers from predictable plot points and cheesy special effects." ...|$|E
500|$|For writing Ibuki, Zubkavich was {{nominated}} for a Joe Shuster Award. He said that, compared to Sakura, [...] "Ibuki's a more complex character, more flawed. She's a great ninja but she isn't even sure this is what she wants out of life. (...) Sakura's never-give-up attitude may be more of a classic anime archetype, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> Ibuki's a character more people can empathize with." [...] He added, [...] "Ibuki’s personality has been limited to game endings and oh-so brief lines of dialogue from her victory quotes, so expanding upon those with this focused story is an honour and a challenge." [...] In a poll by Omar Dogan on his DeviantArt website, most of voters wanted to see Ibuki [...] "wearing something cute", and precisely something in the Harajuku-style Lolita fashion. Dogan's own favourite part of the story was [...] "the part where Ibuki and Oro battle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Men are {{different}} from women, <b>I</b> suppose. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about him that whatever he might do I should forgive it. <b>But</b> then <b>I</b> <b>feel,</b> also, {{that he would never}} do anything for me to forgive." ...|$|R

Well, well," [...] he added, with a deep long-drawn sigh, [...] "who'd have thought I'd lose 'ee, Cuff, in this fashion. It's foolish, no doubt, to take on like this, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> can't help it somehow. I don't believe <b>I</b> could <b>feel</b> much worse if I had lost my old 'ooman. It's kurious, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feels</b> awful lonesome without 'ee, my doggie." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{establishing}} {{a friendship with}} recording artist Miley Cyrus in 2013, Gregory E. Miller from the New York Post noted that the media and general public would continue [...] "following her every move". Ferreira commented that [...] " [...] obviously way bigger and all eyes [...] on her, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like we're kind of going through a similar thing where everyone's {{trying to say that}} we're trying to make ourselves objects, but really, everyone else is making it more like that—sensationalizing sex and reading into things. It's nice to have someone that gets it." [...] Ferreira had also generated a minor controversy after appearing topless on the cover for Night Time, My Time, to which she responded [...] "there's nothing about that photo that's pornographic; we came on this earth nude." [...] Ferreira is also a feminist, which has influenced her work; she has said [...] "I feel like I'm doing a bad job of being a feminist if I'm not making someone angry." ...|$|E
500|$|In the first, an 80-second clip, Leslie gives {{everyone}} in the department tickets to the banquet. She tries to invite Andy, and when Ann says he cannot put on pants due to his cast, Leslie asks, [...] "Does he have a formal kilt or something?" [...] The second clip features 100 seconds of extended banquet sequences, including Ann's reaction to Leslie's haircut, Ann's awkward attempts to make small talk with April and more of Tom's speech to Marlene. In the third, a 30-second clip, set at the bar, Tom describes to Mark his strategy in picking up a girl: he {{asked her what she}} did for a living, then, [...] "I just yawned, gave her the middle finger and left. Pretty risky <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> good about it." [...] In the final clip, which was 15 seconds long, an amused Tom shows a newspaper photo caption of Leslie and Ann from the banquet, with the caption, [...] "Mr. Leslie Knope and wife Ann." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferreira {{was largely}} raised by her grandmother, {{who had been}} Michael Jackson's {{personal}} hairstylist for over 30 years. She commented, saying: [...] "I was raised around him, I always saw him [...] had holidays with him and stuff like that", adding that she was unaware of his fame until she was 13 years old. Ferreira expressed interest in singing as a child and, with Jackson's encouragement, Ferreira's grandmother enrolled her in opera lessons. Ferreira has stated that she was sexually assaulted in her adolescence twice, firstly involving a neighbor, and secondly in an incident that involved a stranger who had broken into her home. In an interview with Rookie, Ferreira said: [...] "I've never said anything [...] because I don't want it to define me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like it's appropriate to say something [...] People feel like it defines you, and it doesn't. It's really unfortunate and disgusting and traumatizing, but it doesn't make you who you are." [...] Ferreira {{dropped out of high}} school after completing her sophomore year.|$|E
