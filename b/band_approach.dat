500|$|Guitar Hero: Metallica, {{like other}} {{games in the}} Guitar Hero series, allows players to {{simulate}} the playing of rock music using special instrument controllers. [...] The game {{is based on the}} <b>band</b> <b>approach</b> presented in Guitar Hero World Tour, and features parts of lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. To successfully complete songs and score, players must use the instruments to play notes that scroll on-screen in time with the music. For lead and bass guitar players, this is done by holding down colored fret buttons on the guitar neck while striking a strum bar; for the drum players, this requires the player to strike the appropriate drum pad or kick with the bass drum pedal; for vocals, the player must attempt to match the pitch of the notes through a microphone. Players earn scoring multipliers for playing several consecutive notes or phrases correctly, and by correctly completing marked phrases, players can earn Star Power which can be released for a higher scoring multiplier. If players miss too many notes, they will eventually fail the song and will have to retry it.|$|E

It was given to Koolau to taste a deeper bitterness, for they hurled imprecations and insults at him as they went by; and the panting hag who brought up the rear halted, and with skinny, harpy-claws extended, shaking her snarling death's {{head from side to}} side, she laid a curse upon him. One by one they dropped over the lip-edge and {{surrendered}} to the hiding soldiers.|$|E

5000|$|According to Michael Jackson of the Jacksons, Bobby Colomby, who was {{producing}} the Jacksons' Destiny album, brought the group [...] "Blame It on the Boogie". [...] "It was an uptempo, finger-poppin'-time type song {{that was a}} good vehicle for the <b>band</b> <b>approach</b> we wanted to cultivate.

5000|$|Compared with {{traditional}} songwriting, the <b>band</b> <b>approach</b> to creating music {{might appear to}} work backward. For example, on [...] "Hush Boy", they created the song's melody with vocalist Vula Malinga over a basic track. Once it was recorded, they kept only Vula's vocal and rebuilt all the music under her voice from scratch. The band says this approach allows for {{a tremendous amount of}} freedom to explore different sounds.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, {{with the}} release of The Message, 4Him changed their overall sound {{in an effort to keep}} pushing the {{creative}} limits of the group. The guys replaced the over-the-top orchestrations and choral vocal arrangements with a stripped down, acoustic <b>band</b> <b>approach</b> where one of the guys would sing lead and the other three would sing backing vocals. On 1998’s Obvious, each member took more ownership of their music - becoming more involved in the production and songwriting aspects.|$|E

Accompanied by his cousin Odell, Thompson was {{recognized}} with several honors for performances of the old-time style, particularly when the genre was repopularized in the 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, he recorded his first studio albums, consisting of a repertoire rooted in the authentic string <b>band</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|E
5000|$|We Come to Play was {{the first}} and only album {{released}} by BUX in 1976. The album was originally recorded in 1973 but Capitol decided not to release it. In 1976, however, when lead guitarist Punky Meadows and bassist Mickie Jones had success with their band Angel, Capitol tried to cash in and finally released We Come to Play. The album is an interesting affair blending hard rock and the standard boogie <b>band</b> <b>approach</b> with varied results.

The Acoustic Guitar Magazine describes their music as an [...] "upbeat brand of Americana with lots of twang, a dash of wit, and a splash of surrealism." [...] At many of their shows, the Brothers Comatose would encourage crowd participation, including clapping, sing-along, and passing around chopsticks to use as percussion instruments. The band redefines bluegrass music as a blend of contemporary rock and traditional bluegrass. Glide Magazine claims that the Brothers Comatose [...] "bows both to tradition and contemporary designs. There’s is a rugged, rustic sound that’s implied in each of these eleven songs, one that allows their old timey string <b>band</b> <b>approach</b> to ring with an air of authenticity." ...|$|E

5000|$|USA Today praised that [...] "Manson and {{producer}} Michael Beinhorn have rediscovered the adrenalin in '70s glam-rock, sprinkling Gary Glitter and Ziggy Stardust over Gothic theatrics." [...] Jon Wiederhorn of Amazon observed that [...] "Mechanical Animals is a brash, decadent, and glittery display of self-indulgent hooks and melodramatic vocals {{that sounds like}} Aladdin Sane-era David Bowie and T. Rex at their most boisterous crossed with the more modern sounds of today's industrial nation." [...] Ann Powers of Rolling Stone commented [...] "Mechanical Animals gets its cavelike spaciousness from goth influences and tweaks them with an industrial crunch ... He and his <b>band</b> <b>approach</b> its terrain the way a 1960s rocker like Eric Clapton approaches the blues, with respect {{and a sense of}} entitlement." [...] Annalee Newitz of Salon commented, [...] "With 'Mechanical Animals' Manson is softening up, turning away from his dour preoccupation with religious fascism and toward space-age genderfuck chic. The creamy synth sound and drugged-out lyrics that dominate Manson's latest CD prove that two antithetical '80s musical genres - heavy metal and new wave - can indeed be fruitfully combined ... 'Mechanical Animals' is a far better album than the recent 'Antichrist Superstar,' taking Manson in new directions without turning the volume down on his magnetic weirdness." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bad and Beautiful is {{an album}} by the American jazz {{musician}} Sun Ra and his Arkestra. Recorded in 1961 in New York City at the Choreographers' Workshop, 414 W. 51st St., {{the album was}} the second to be recorded in New York by the Arkestra after leaving Chicago, but would remain unreleased until 1972. The album is considered to represent an important transition between the big <b>band</b> <b>approach</b> of the Chicago recordings, and the more 'outside' approach of Ra's smaller bands recorded later in the decade:'Aside from [...] "Exotic Two," [...] the tunes are split between standards (apparently the last ones the group would record until the '70s) and blues originals, but there are indications of the direction the Arkestra would take throughout the '60s. [...] "Search Light Blues" [...] has some interesting percussion accents finding {{their way into the}} arrangement, and [...] "Exotic Two" [...] alludes more clearly to the percussion-heavy sound that dominated many of the '60s recordings. Sun Ra plays piano exclusively on this recording, and Gilmore gets lots of room to shine. A significant transitional LP, this is probably the last [...] "inside" [...] record the Arkestra would record as they forged new sonic paths into the mid-'60s.' Sean Westergaard, All Music Guide linkAccording to Ra's biographer, John F Szwed, the album announced that Ra was 'now in New York', with its inclusion of the theme music from the film The Bad and the Beautiful, and its Broadway show tunes And This Is My Beloved and Just In Time.|$|E
40|$|The crack <b>band</b> <b>approach</b> (in the smeared crack concept) {{is widely}} used for the {{modeling}} of concrete fracture and is an important analysis technique within advanced engineering. However, the simulations can be impeded by mesh-induced directional bias. Cracks prefer to propagate along continuous mesh lines, which causes a dependency of the numerical results on the structure and orientation of the finite element discretization. In this PhD research, two different enhancements of the crack <b>band</b> <b>approach</b> are proposed to reduce the mesh bias as much as possible. The performance of both enhancements is investigated by simulations of plain concrete fracture tests and a shear critical reinforced concrete beam without shear reinforcement. Both enhancements increase {{the accuracy of the}} crack <b>band</b> <b>approach</b> in the smeared crack concept and simultaneously preserve its relative simplicity. Hence, they can be valuable for engineering practice, supporting reliable predictions of ultimate load capacities, failure mechanisms and post-peak behaviors of quasi-brittle reinforced concrete structures.
