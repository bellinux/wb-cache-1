Not much hope of a competitive season was ever tossed Owen Sound's way. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> the return a success isn't the season record—it {{was the lack of}} a mass exodus of players at the Christmas Break. Players bought into the rebuilding process and stuck it out which earned a tremendous amount of respect from around the league and left the Greys in a good position with a solid nucleus to build on for next season.|$|E

[...] In a review for The New York Times, Caryn James called When Harry Met Sally... an [...] "often funny but amazingly hollow film" [...] that [...] "romanticized lives of intelligent, successful, neurotic New Yorkers"; James characterized it as [...] "the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film, full of amusing lines and scenes, all infused with an uncomfortable sense of déjà vu".|$|E
500|$|The {{television}} show was noted {{as a part}} of the mid-2000s films, television, and books that drove a resurgence of the public popularity of magic. Criss Angel Mindfreak was the first weekly magic {{television show}} to air in forty years. Daily Variety reviewed the premiere writing, [...] "The stunts alone are impressive. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> the show fascinating are the down-home touches in which we see the kid from New York, who first honed his magic skills at the age of 6. Keenly aware of the camera at all times, Angel manages to offer some personality, especially where family is involved. Viewers follow the illusionist as he contemplates new and more dangerous stunts, while his crew, including his often-fretful brothers, offer insight as to what, other than ego, drives someone in this profession." ...|$|E

Y. Sunita Chowdary, also from The Hindu, wrote [...] "The Businessman has a mix of action, image, dialogue and montage <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> it entertaining {{is that all the}} above quantities are inextricably bound and linked together at every level with an admirably tight script." [...] She added that Jagannadh did not make any structural, technical or content errors, although the story was a regular one. Suresh Kavirayani of The Times of India gave the film 3.25 out of 5 stars and called the film an [...] "unpretentious entertainer that manages to strike the right balance", which according to him, had enough in it to keep the viewers interested till the end despite not being a spectacular production.|$|E

School Library Journal called it [...] "an engrossing adventure for fantasy fans and for those new to the genre." [...] Common Sense Media gave it a 5/5 and credited the book's [...] "strong characters, vivid descriptions, flawless pacing, breathless excitement, laughs and scares, and a vision that makes this fantasy very different." [...] Readers have also praised the novel; Jane LeGak, an Amazon Reviewer, stated that, [...] "Rats and other wonderfully creepy creatures fill the story's dark underworld, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> this book so wonderful is how human it is." [...] A. Reid, also from Amazon.com, praised the believable characters, saying, [...] "Gregor {{is one of the}} most warmly believable characters I've encountered in a children's novel in a long time." [...] As of August 2015, users on Amazon.com had given the book a rating of 4.5 stars out of 5, and Barnes & Noble reviews awarded it a total of 4.4 stars.|$|E
500|$|The Persona {{series has}} been {{referred}} to as the most popular spin-off from the Megami Tensei franchise, gaining notoriety and success in its own right. Io9's James Whitbrook commented that while [...] "here in the west, we've got plenty of awesome urban fantasy, especially from a YA perspective. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> Persona interesting is that it's the familiar concept of Urban fantasy, the balance of the mundane [...] "normal" [...] life of the protagonists and the problems they have there with the fantastical nature of the supernatural world that lies beneath all that, from a Japanese perspective. Over here, that's much less common, and the way the series portrays urban fantasy through that lens is what makes it so different, especially from what you would normally expect from Japanese RPGs.". Nintendo Power, in an article concerning the Megami Tensei series, cited the Persona series' [...] "modern-day horror stories" [...] and [...] "teams of Japanese high-school kids" [...] as the perfect example of the franchise. Persona was mentioned in 1999 by GameSpot's Andrew Vestal as a game that deserved attention despite not aging well, saying [...] "Examining Persona reveals three of the traits that make the series so popular - and unique - amongst RPG fans: demonology, negotiation, and psychology". The game has been named as a cult classic. Persona 3 was named by RPGamer as the greatest RPG of the past decade in 2009, and RPGFan listed Persona 3 and 4 in second and fourth place respectively in their similar 2011 list. Persona 3 was listed by Gamasutra as one of the 20 essential RPGs for players of the genre. Persona 4 was also listed by Famitsu {{as one of the greatest}} games of all time in a 2010 list.|$|E

500|$|Cannibal {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics upon its release. The album holds a score 73 out of 100 based on 11 critical reviews, {{according to the}} music review aggregator Metacritic. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic was positive in the review of Cannibal. Erlewine was somewhat critical of the choice to release the EP noting that the only real reason for the release was that Animal had been [...] "squeezed dry of hits". Although critical of the re-release, Thomas' consensus of the album was positive, writing: [...] "aided by the tight focus of an eight-track EP, Cannibal’s brevity trumping the scattershot Animal -- <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> them stick is Kesha, a pop star lacking pop star looks and a pop star voice. She’s all ravenous id, spitting at strangers and backstabbing friends, humiliating hotties, and laughing at the wreckage in her wake. She is who she is and she offers no apologies." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented on Kesha's writing of the album noting that her [...] "herky-jerky rhymes still sound like {{they came from the}} bathroom wall of a reform-school kindergarten", not citing that as a negative but instead noting that the album had a [...] "sulfurous end-of-days whiff about it". Greenblatt ended her review of the album giving it a rating of [...] "B+" [...] and called [...] "Sleazy" [...] and [...] "Blow" [...] the standout tracks on the album. Will Hermes from Rolling Stone noted that Kesha's main pop competitor was Lady Gaga writing, [...] "This EP proves Kesha would kick Gaga's ass in a freestyle battle" [...] praising her rhyming and production by Dr. Luke calling Kesha the [...] "snap queen of clubland." [...] Chad Grischow from IGN met the album with a positive review, giving the album a score of 6.5 out of 10. Grischow was critical of the production of the album and overuse of Auto-Tune writing that there was [...] "so much overdubbing and autotune used that most of the songs may as well be sung by a spunky robot". He also noted that when Kesha's vocals were stripped down she could actually sing, highlighting the ballads [...] "The Harold Song" [...] and [...] "C U Next Tuesday" [...] in the album's review. Grischow ended his review writing, [...] "Cannibal proves to be too mired in mindless lyrics and excessive vocal effects to have any lasting appeal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Noted {{for winning}} the Series of Younger Poets {{competition}} in 1983, The Evolution of the Flightless Bird {{is the first of}} four books that Kenney has published so far. Contest judge James Merrill praised its daring stylistic approach in the forward. Containing three sections of poetry ('The Hours of the Day,' 'First Poems,' and 'Heroes'), the book is made up of [...] "not well-wrought urns so much as complex molecules programmed to coalesce into larger structures" [...] (Merrill, Foreword). <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> this book stand out is not that it consists of multiple sonnets, but that the delivery is so original and so far-fetched that its publication sparked much discussion about Kenney's style. A book with images varying from sea to battle scenes, The Evolution of the Flightless Bird marks the beginning of Kenney's career as a poet.|$|E
2500|$|She {{released}} a second book in 2003, titled Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown. The book, which was previously known as Good and Evil, chronicled nine case studies during {{her life as}} a Wiccan healer and gives explanations as to why those events happened. To promote the book, Chakraverti held a healing session at Oxford Bookstore in Kolkata, where she read excerpts from the book, and gave demonstration of her healing skills, holding the hand of a volunteer, tapping her with her athame (wand) and reciting Egyptian chants. After its release, the book received positive reaction from critics. Rajdeep Bains from The Tribune commented [...] "Sacred Evil is a very coherent account of the author’s dealings with witchcraft and sorcery. Unfortunately, it could add to superstition, which is already prevalent at an unhealthy level in our country. As a work of fiction it would have been laudable; given the cover of truth it becomes a dangerous piece of writing. [...] <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> Sacred Evil so interesting is the juxtaposition of modern thought with the ageless. After every chapter there are notes on the practices described in it along with modern explanations." [...] Krithika Ranjan from The Hindu commented, [...] "Throughout [...] Chakraverti refers to herself as a skeptic. Yet the stories she tells are bound to raise the ire of [...] rationalists. You can almost hear one spluttering about superstition as you read the story Those who return. [...] In the final analysis, the book is a good read— whether you believe in the dark arts or whether you just want to curl up with a spine chiller." [...] Chakraverti started working on her third book, tentatively titled Every Strong Woman is a Witch.|$|E
