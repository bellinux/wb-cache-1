40|$|Using {{per capita}} GDP {{for all the}} {{counties}} and cities for the year 1997, China's regional inequalities are decomposed into their intra-provincial/regional, inter-provincial/regional components. Regardless of the attributes used, inter-provincial/regional inequalities {{are by no means}} the dominant sources of overall inequalities, and thus there is no justification for ignoring intra-provincial/regional inequalities. If the investment in fixed assets is classified into sources of founds, there is no strong correlation can be found between GDP and the investment of state <b>budgetary</b> <b>appropriation</b> compared with other investments. Based on some time-series data and the fact that labor markets are still fragmented across provinces lines, {{it is safe to say}} that intra-provincial/regional inequalities will last for a long time. From the findings of this article, an interesting policy implication can be drawn with respect to the development of the coastal, interior, and western provinces. If narrowing the gap among the provinces or regions is only achieved through investment in industrial projects of some special counties and cities, and if the issue of intra-provincial/regional is not properly addressed, the reduction of inequalities among the provinces/regions may not necessarily result in a substantial decrease in overall inequalities. Another policy implication sheds light on the importance for the local-governments to redistribute resources in order to reduce the intra-provincial/regional inequalities. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{significant}} role and position of human capital in achieving meaningful, purposeful and {{sustainable economic growth}} and development in any nation seems to be uncontestable. This is because human capital is a sine qua non for development, particularly for LDCs and emerging economies like Nigeria. Therefore,any country that misplaces the priority of Human Capital Development (HCD) will indeed go nowhere as far as development is concerned. This paper therefore made a historical overview of human capital development in Nigeria vis-Ã -vis government expenditure in key sectors like education, health etc. that have direct and positive impact on HCD. This overview becomes imperative for policy focus and guide of the government, {{in view of the}} fact that the major thrust of the administration is to make Nigeria one of the biggest and leading economies by the year 2020. However, going through historical records, it became clear that factors such as unpatriotic leadership, endemic corruption, misplacement of priority, political instability, inadequate funding of key sectors etc. impacted negatively on HCD. In order to make possible the realisation of âVision 2020 â (which holds enormous development potentials and opportunities for the country), then the Nigerian government needs to adopt some lessons from the Malaysian experience,particularly as it relates to HCD. Some of the lessons identified include: Comprehensive Perspective Plan, appropriate and timely execution of HCD-oriented programmes and projects, adequate budgetary allocations to key sectors that have direct and immediate impact on HCD, timely presentation and passage of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>appropriation</b> bill, special preference for the proliferation of ICT among the workforce,granting fiscal incentives to the private sectors that are HCD inclined and adequate recognition and appropriation of the socio-cultural and religious peculiarities of the federating units for possible optimum development...|$|R

Following different guidelines, although {{they are in the}} same industry ({{colleges and universities}}), makes accounting for such entities unique. One instance of this uniqueness is depreciation recognition. Governmental colleges and universities have accounted for capital assets in a format different from for-profit businesses and nongovernmental colleges and universities. However, due to some basic changes in accounting definition and the need for college and university financial statements to be comparable, there is high probability that governmental colleges and universities might be required to account for depreciation in a format similar to these entities. If this change should occur, and if the proper authorities are not educated about the change, governmental college and university appropriation levels could be affected. ^ The purpose for conducting this study was to identify a process that is used when changing an accounting method, such as, a change from nonrecognition of capital asset depreciation to the recognition of capital asset depreciation. Nongovernmental college and university chief business officers, or their designees, and selected board members and auditors were interviewed in order to ascertain what steps constitute the standard process of this change and the impact on the financial statements. Once identified, this process and its impact on financials can be used to educate governmental college boards, legislators, commissioners of postsecondary education and staff who may be affected by financial statement data in their decision making process. Nongovernmental college and university financial statements, board minutes and budgets were reviewed to substantiate the change process. ^ The second {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the steps that were used in the process of converting financial statements from nonrecognition of depreciation to the recognition of depreciation.

For private production in a competitive market, and for the enterprise as a whole, the worth of the activity is most easily measured by the price the buyer is willing to pay; the net social utility of the producer is well approximated by his profits during a given period, the âbottom line; â and persistent losses will drive companies out of business. 1 This is so, however, only when the buyer gets all {{the benefits of the}} product and (indirectly) pays all the costs. When indivisibilities and external effects exist (positive or negative such as water pollution), or where there cannot be a competitive market (as for public goods), the âbottom line â is not as easy to define, the activity is assigned to the public sector, and the measurement of the impact of public-sector activity therefore becomes a difficult and complex issue. 2 However, to limit the notion of public âperformance â only to compliance with <b>budgetary</b> <b>appropriations,</b> or to literal observance of rules and regulations, leads over time to forgetting the real purpose of spending monies obtained from the public at large.

This requires a careful definition of priorities for action and the determination of appropriate pacing and sequencing of reform.

40|$|During the thirty-year period {{beginning}} in 1962, South Korea continually posted annual economic growth figures of seven points above the annual average. In 1996, {{following in the}} footsteps of Japan, it became an Asian member nation to the OECD. Economic growth was given priority over social security at this time, with the result that the latter showed little development, though calls for greater commitment to social security grew louder on the strength of OECD membership. The Asian currency crisis of 1997, beginning with the collapse of Thailand's Baht, directly affected South Korea, however, leading to an economic crisis. Despite such conditions, it was decided that a major policy shift on social security was needed. For one thing, Korea's population was aging more rapidly than anywhere else in the world, and many predicted this would have powerful socio-economic repercussions. The present essay examines the current state of funding appropriations, special features of public policies toward the aged, and the problem of social security with regard to South Korea's aging society. In particular, we discuss problems in welfare, medical insurance, and social services for the elderly, while clarifying the impact of an aging society on economic conditions. Our first section explains current fund allocation procedures, including changes in <b>budgetary</b> <b>appropriations</b> for public health insurance and social security. The trend in recent years has been to increase funding in these areas, but compared with other OECD member nations it remains inadequate. In the second section, we note the existence of policies and programs that show respect for the elderly, and provide preferential treatment for them. However, when compared with Europe and the United States, the social security system still lags behind. Our third section argues that the rapid aging of society in South Korea urgently demands an overhaul of welfare and public health systems, as well as social assistance for the elderly. If this overhaul is delayed, the socio-economic consequences will be severe...|$|E
40|$|For {{the republics}} of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) as for many other {{transition}} economies, {{an important step in}} introducing a more market-oriented system was the restructuring of their budget systems. This paper reviews and evaluates the process of budget system reform during the transition period extending from the time they emerged from the collapse of the SFRY in 1989 until the end of 2002. For at least a decade of this period, the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF has been providing technical assistance (TA) to these countries to facilitate such reforms. Based on the material generated by this effort, the authors offer a review of the progress made and an assessment of the reform elements still to be completed. Given that the former Yugoslav republics all commenced the reform process with the same institutions, this paper offers a unique opportunity to analyze the critical elements in successful budget system reform. An attempt is made to explain the varying degrees of success experienced by different countries, and a reform agenda is suggested to guide future TA.
