5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s Terry-Thomas began {{appearing}} in American films, coarsening his already unsubtle screen character in {{films such as}} <b>Bachelor</b> <b>Flat,</b> It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and How to Murder Your Wife. From the mid-1960s he frequently starred in European films, in roles such as Sir Reginald in the successful French film La Grande Vadrouille. In 1971 Terry-Thomas was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, which slowly brought his career to a conclusion: his last film role was in 1980. He {{spent much of his}} fortune on medical treatment and, shortly before his death, was living in poverty, existing on charity from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. A charity gala was held in his honour, which raised sufficient funds for him to live his remaining time in a nursing home.|$|E
5|$|Terry-Thomas {{spent part}} of 1961 in America, filming the role of Professor Bruce Patterson in Bachelor Flat—his first Hollywood role—before flying to Gibraltar to film Operation Snatch, in which he teamed up with Lionel Jeffries. By the end of 1961 Terry-Thomas was {{appearing}} on radio, in guest spots on American television shows, such as the December broadcast of The Bing Crosby Show, and was frequently the subject of US newspaper interviews. In 1962 <b>Bachelor</b> <b>Flat</b> and Operation Snatch were both released, and were followed by two more films: a large-budget biopic from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer called The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm, in which Terry-Thomas shared his scenes with the American comedian Buddy Hackett, and Kill or Cure, in which he appeared with Sykes, a friend since they worked together in Large as Life.|$|E

50|$|Designed as <b>bachelor</b> <b>flats,</b> four-story Newburn {{was created}} in 1939 by Romberg, Shaw, et al. The first design was changed {{in order to make}} it more {{cost-effective}} and fulfil client’s fresh requirements. The style of the Newburn is new, incorporating the design to raise the privacy of the balconies, views and provide a north orientation. At the same time, it takes in the Expressionist’s curved elements without leaving out the Mendelsohn’s bold horizontals. These eventually create a more artistic external to the plan that is overly-focused on functions.|$|R
500|$|Before {{starting}} filming {{or making}} an entrance on stage, Terry-Thomas had a routine he would undertake: [...] "my own technique {{to get myself}} going was... to jump {{in the air and}} execute a few dance steps". His approach for much of his film work was to underplay many of his reactions. Filming a scene in a cinema in Private's Progress, a close-up was needed showing his character [...] "registering shock, fury, indignation and anything else I could stuff in"; he [...] "just looked into the camera and kept my mind blank. It's a trick I've used often since. In this way, the audience does the work". Terry-Thomas said [...] "I like to do my own stunts", which he did for films such as A Matter of WHO and <b>Bachelor</b> <b>Flat.</b> This included some dangerous work; for example, during Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, he ran along the roof of a moving train.|$|E

5000|$|Although quite fashionable in Sydney and in London, flats {{designed}} {{especially for}} single women were uncommon in Queensland, {{and no other}} self-contained block for this purpose {{is known to have}} been purpose-constructed in Brisbane in the interwar period. Sometimes referred to as [...] "bachelor flats", they were distinguished from one-bedroom flats in that the bedroom and sitting room were combined, with a small kitchenette attached (sometimes just an alcove with a sink and single gas burner). <b>Bachelor</b> <b>flats</b> often had shared bathrooms, water closets and laundries, and were in reality tenements, not self-contained flats. For example, the only other identified, purpose-built interwar flat/tenement building in Brisbane designed expressly to accommodate single girls was St Helier, a block of six brick tenements erected in 1930 in Grey St, South Brisbane (no longer extant). Each apartment comprised a bed-sitting room with kitchenette. Bathrooms and water closets were shared - one bath per three persons - and there was a common laundry. In 1932 a second storey was added, comprising three tenements and an owner's flat of six rooms. Similarly, a few blocks of [...] "bachelor flats" [...] or tenements were erected in Brisbane for single men - such as Donegal (1934 and 1936) on St Paul's Terrace in Fortitude Valley. Bulolo was unusual in that, although designed along the lines of [...] "bachelor flats", the apartments were self-contained with private bathrooms and water closets.|$|R
40|$|Bachelor’s thesis „Romany housing“ {{deals with}} the issue of {{underprivileged}} accomodation. This is a complex of four apartment buildings and one community center. It is located on the site in Brno-Maloměřice. The site is flat, it is surrounded by little terraced houses on one side and large prefabricated metal halls on the other side. Apartment buildings respond to the surroundings by creating transition between little houses and large halls - they have relatively large mass, but it is split by saw-tooth roof that creates illusion of terraced houses. Main idea of the project is layout variability - it reacts to various number of romany family members. Single apartement building has two storeys, community center has one story and basement. Supporting structure is made of aerated concrete blocks. The foundations are made of non-reinforced concrete, the roof is partly saw-tooth, partly <b>flat.</b> <b>Bachelor’s</b> thesis includes a model and a detail of recessed railing in reinforcedconcrete wall which carries the exterior staircase...|$|R

50|$|The single bedroom-cum-sitting {{room was}} the {{precursor}} to the <b>bachelor</b> <b>flat.</b> The construction of single-sex bachelor flats was a reflection of contemporary Brisbane attitudes which considered flats inappropriate places in which to raise a family, and the mixing of single persons of both sexes in flat buildings was viewed as undesirable and conducive to immoral behaviour. Flats were largely thought of as catering to a floating population and, along with the lifestyle changes necessitated when living beyond the detached house and garden, were yet to be accepted as permanent homes.|$|E
