500|$|The cartridge's circuit <b>board</b> <b>layout</b> {{is unique}} {{compared}} to most Famicom games, using a single two megabyte PRG (program) ROM chips. A RAM chip {{is used instead}} of a ROM for the character graphics data, similar to the [...] "UNROM" [...] method used in some Nintendo games. As a result, the data is strewn across the PRG ROM in various banks. The cartridge features one 8-kilobyte battery-backed RAM chip, used for the game's single save slot. Many of the game's graphics are borrowed from other games, mostly other Final Fantasy titles and including Super NES graphics converted to four-color palettes used by the Famicom's hardware. Much of the game's music is borrowed from other games as well, in many cases shortened significantly to a few repeating notes.|$|E

2500|$|A modern, more elaborate, Chinese game {{known as}} Land Battle Chess (Lu Zhan Qi) or Army Chess (Lu Zhan Jun Qi) is a {{descendant}} of Jungle, and a cousin of Stratego: It is played on a 5x13 board with two un-occupiable spaces {{in the middle and}} each player has 25 playing pieces. The initial setup is not fixed, both players keep their pieces hidden from their opponent, and the objective is to capture the enemy's flag. Lu Zhan Jun Qi's basic gameplay is similar, though differences include [...] "missile" [...] pieces and a Chinese Chess-style <b>board</b> <b>layout</b> with the addition of railroads and defensive [...] "camps". A third player is also typically used as a neutral referee to decide battles between pieces without revealing their identities. An expanded version of the Land Battle Chess game also exists, adding naval and aircraft pieces and is known as Sea-Land-Air Battle Chess (Hai Lu Kong Zhan Qi).|$|E

50|$|The {{board is}} made up of four square panels, each {{comprising}} 12 x 12 movement spaces. The mountains and rough terrain are scattered throughout the board space.

50|$|There are {{numerous}} {{variations of the}} game. While these games {{are similar to the}} original Scrabble game, they include minor variations. For example, Literati draws random tiles instead of providing a finite number of tiles for the game, assigns different point levels to each letter and has a slightly different <b>board</b> <b>layout</b> whereas Lexulous assigns eight letters to each player instead of the customary seven. Words with Friends uses a different <b>board</b> <b>layout</b> and different letter values and so do Words of Gold.|$|E

[...] Units with their leads pre-bent may be ordered to fit specific <b>board</b> <b>layouts,</b> depending on the application. Otherwise, the leads may be bent manually; however, care must be taken as they can break easily, as with any other device that is manually configured.|$|R
