5|$|Many feminist economists argue {{economics}} {{should be}} focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) {{and more on}} well-being, a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment and social status. They argue that economic success can not <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> only by goods or gross domestic product, but must also <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> by human well-being. Aggregate income {{is not sufficient to}} evaluate general well-being, because individual entitlements and needs must also be considered, leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.|$|E

5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E

The quantities measured with NMR are time-averaged chemical shifts, as proton exchange is fast on the NMR time-scale. Other chemical shifts, such as those of 31P can <b>be</b> <b>measured.</b>|$|E
