The Raiffeisen Zentralbank, the Oberbank and industrialist Hannes Androsch stated they are not interested in increasing their shares of the AUA, while the Vienna Insurance Group was considering this; it thus appeared that the ÖIAG might have to hold most of its shares in order for Austria to hold a <b>blocking</b> <b>minority.</b> The official decision to give the ÖIAG a mandate to privatise the AUA was made at a cabinet meeting on 12 August 2008.|$|E

The exit of the UK from the European Union means that this <b>blocking</b> <b>minority</b> can no longer be assembled leading to speculation that it could enable the other EU countries to enforce specific proposals such as relaxing EU budget discipline or providing EU-wide deposit guarantees within the banking union.|$|E
50|$|While Austrian Airlines CEO Alfred Ötsch {{called for}} {{retaining}} {{the independence of}} Austrian Airlines (AUA), {{he changed his mind}} once Saudi Arabian investor Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber decided not to go through with his plans to invest €150 million into the corporation. Due to the worsening situation for airlines it is now seen as necessary to find a strong partner for the AUA; airlines which had expressed an interest include Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Aeroflot, Royal Jordanian, Air China, Turkish Airlines and Singapore Airlines (though Aeroflot has since rejected investing into the AUA). In order for the investment plans to go through, the outgoing government had to agree to give the Österreichische Industrieholding AG (ÖIAG) the mandate to privatise; SPÖ and ÖVP disagreed, however, how much of the 42.75% of AUA shares the ÖIAG holds should be offered for sale. The SPÖ insisted on retaining a <b>blocking</b> <b>minority</b> of 25% plus one share, as Faymann voiced fears that the position of Vienna International Airport as the main hub for Eastern Europe and the Balkans might otherwise be endangered; while the ÖVP agreed that it would be preferable to retain a <b>blocking</b> <b>minority,</b> it did not see this as a condition for the privatisation and preferred to give the ÖIAG a broad mandate for privatisation so that the best partner airline could be found; economy minister Martin Bartenstein voiced his preference for a sale to Lufthansa, which had stated it was only interested in a complete acquisition of the AUA. At a meeting on 5 August 2008 it was agreed that a <b>blocking</b> <b>minority</b> would have to remain in Austrian hands, but that this did not necessarily mean that the shares had to be held by the ÖIAG; the <b>blocking</b> <b>minority</b> shares could also be bought by Austrian corporations. The Greens criticised the solution as a botch-up typical of the grand coalition, claiming that either the ÖIAG should keep the <b>blocking</b> <b>minority</b> or no one at all and also alluding to possible cases of favouritism towards industralists close to SPÖ and ÖVP; both the Greens and the FPÖ called for the resignation of Ötsch and ÖIAG director Peter Michaelis, and the FPÖ proposed that Vienna International Airport should instead buy a <b>blocking</b> <b>minority</b> of the AUA shares. The BZÖ supported the agreement between SPÖ and ÖVP and claimed to have proposed a solution with a strategic partner for the AUA long before, even when all other parties had called for stand-alone solution.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{its unique}} nature, and the {{political}} sensitivities surrounding it, there is no common or legal classification for the European Union (EU). However, it does bear some resemblance to both a confederation (or a [...] "new" [...] type of confederation) and a federation. The EU operates common economic policies with hundreds of common laws, which enable a single economic market, open internal borders, a common currency among most member-states and allow for numerous other areas where powers have been transferred and directly applicable laws are made. However, unlike a federation, the EU does not have exclusive powers over foreign affairs, defence and taxation. Furthermore, laws sometimes must be transcribed into national law by national parliaments; decisions by member states are taken by special majorities with <b>blocking</b> <b>minorities</b> accounted for; and treaty amendment requires ratification by every member state before it can come into force.|$|R

50|$|The Heterojunction-emitter bipolar {{transistor}} (HEBT), is a somewhat unusual arrangement {{with respect to}} emitter <b>blocking</b> of <b>minority</b> carriers. This is accomplished by using heterostructure confinement in the emitter, introducing an energy barrier to minority-carrier charge flow from the base. This is important as loss of minority carriers from the base to the emitter degrades analog performance. The main difference of the HEBT from the Heterojunction {{bipolar transistor}} (HBT) is that the emitter-base interface {{is the same as}} in a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) with the blocking energy gap being moved back into the emitter bulk region.|$|R

Between 1990 and 2005, 14 {{percent of the}} world’s public firms were targets in a <b>minority</b> <b>block</b> acquisition, of which one third are cross-border in nature. These firms are mostly financially constrained with high growth opportunities and experience significant increases in their stock prices at the announcement. Financially constrained targets that have joint ventures or alliances with the corporate acquirers experience largest increases in their stock price. In the immediate two years following the acquisition, 27 percent of target firms issue new equity {{and the increase in}} the amount of net equity issuances is large. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that equity stake purchases by other corporations are useful in alleviating asymmetric information faced by target firms in raising external capital. There is little evidence that corporate blockowners lower contracting costs in the product market, effectively monitor insiders or capitalize on their overvalued stocks. 2 Between 1990 and 2005, 14 percent of public firms around the world were targets in a <b>minority</b> <b>block</b> acquisition, with the fraction of acquired equity averaging 16 percent. 1 There is also large cross-country variation in corporate block acquisition activities.

40|$|Further {{diversification}} of local police forces {{is essential in}} any systematic response to current dif-ficulties in police-minority relations. The authors explore the relevance of out- and intragroup competition on Hispanic employment—one dimension of police diversification. The results in-dicate that competition is relevant in any dialogue on evolving ethnically diverse police forces or on increasing the role of Hispanic women. Black employment casts a negative influence on His-panic employment generally, and that negative influence extends to Hispanic males and females separately. Generally, white females compete with Hispanics, particularly in minority Hispanic cit-ies. Within Hispanic groups, the successes of Hispanic males and Hispanic females are zero-sum.

40|$|Social impacts {{associated}} with new telecommunication innovations greatly affect both globalisation and territorial identities. Apparently contradictory trends {{bring with them}} elements of rapid social change and political uncertainty. This chapter reflects on the conjunction of both dimensions of the local and the global, and carries out a prescription of the progressive consolidation of a new cosmopolitan localism. A theoretical review {{of the concept of}} multiple identities precedes a subsequent discussion on the effects of globalisation, the extension of market values, and the relative loss of power by the nation states. Subsequently, the focus is set on the growing role played by the global mesocommunities. These can be small nation-states within regional supranational <b>blocks,</b> stateless <b>minority</b> nations, sub-state regions and large conurbations, and seem to be better equipped to maximise developments related to global action and local identities. References made to the European Union context seek to illustrate how the interaction of the processes of bottom-up transnationalisation and top-down devolution of powers have made possible a more effective access of civil society to multi-level decision-making. The new cosmopolitan localism translates into a growing adjustment between the particular and the general in the gradual development of Europeanisation.

50|$|Over the years, through {{numerous}} {{mergers and}} acquisitions, the {{printing and publishing}} house evolved into a large corporate group, which {{after the death of}} Franz Burda Sr was re-organized in the year 1986. The brothers, Franz and Frieder, took over all affiliate shares, including those in US printing houses, German paper factories and Austrian media distribution. The most lucrative were the shares in the Berlin-based publisher Axel Springer, which distributed dividends in the millions. Already back in 1983, Burda had acquired a stake of 24.9% in Axel Springer. Franz and Frieder bundled their shareholdings in F+F Burda KG based in Baden-Baden. Hubert Burda became the sole shareholder of Burda GmbH with headquarters in Offenburg. This company bundled all German printing and publishing activities. By separating the operative business from the shareholding in Axel Springer, the owners averted anti-trust issues. As a result, Franz Burda Jr and Frieder Burda were able to increase their equity into a <b>blocking</b> <b>minority.</b> In 1988, they suddenly sold their shares again to the heirs of Axel Springer, although they had actually been seeking a majority in Axel Springer with Leo Kirch.

The static relation of ownership to control in Germany is therefore similar to the UK and US. There are, however, marked differences in dynamic relations involving transfers of ownership.
