25|$|Initially, the Romani were herded into {{so called}} ghettos, {{including}} the Warsaw Ghetto (April–June 1942), where {{they formed a}} distinct class {{in relation to the}} Jews. Ghetto diarist Emmanuel Ringelblum speculated that Romani were sent to the Warsaw Ghetto because the Germans wanted:...to toss into the Ghetto everything that is characteristically dirty, shabby, bizarre, of which one ought to <b>be</b> <b>frightened,</b> and which anyway has to be destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Jesus {{repeatedly}} {{denounced the}} Pharisees for their {{additions to the}} Law of God. Thus, we must be extremely careful about what laws we lay down for people. Does the Bible clearly state that contraception is sinful, or that people are obligated {{to have as many}} children as possible? If the Bible does not say these things, we need to fear God and <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> of adding to His Word.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{response}} to the band's debut album Go to the Future, Sakanaction's A team pushed them to quickly follow this up with a second album. The majority of the songs present on the album were written specifically as an album, as opposed to the compilation-like nature of Go to the Future. The material for the album was created based on {{the response}} and criticism for their debut album, and the members realization that they should not <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> to make bold changes.|$|E
25|$|Underneath the bay on the {{far left}} is the bronze statue of Perseus by Benvenuto Cellini. It shows the mythical Greek hero holding his sword in his right hand and holding up the Medusa's severed head in his left. The well-proportioned muscular body of Perseus stands poised on the right leg. Perseus is {{reflecting}} and he seems to <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> by his same action. Blood is gushing from the head and the neck of the dead Medusa. The richly decorated marble pedestal, also by Cellini, shows four graceful bronze statuettes of Jupiter, Mercurius, Minerva and Danaë. The bas-relief on the pedestal, representing Perseus freeing Andromeda, is a copy of the one in Bargello.|$|E
25|$|The State of Israel {{required}} all {{buildings to}} have access to air-raid shelters from 1951, and all new flats possess access to Merkhav Mugan. All medical and educational facilities are prepared for CRBN attacks (as of 2010) (as an example each surgery room is built to withstand a direct missile hit); some are built with closed-cycle air systems and are capable of being resistant to chemical agents for short periods of time; in addition all must include chemical air filtering systems. The public air-raid shelters are commonly employed as game rooms in peacetime so that the children will be comfortable to enter them at a time of need, and will not <b>be</b> <b>frightened.</b>|$|E

25|$|During {{the last}} few years of his rule in Tuscany, Leopold had begun to <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> by the {{increasing}} disorders in the German and Hungarian dominions of his family, which were the direct result of his brother's strict methods. He and Joseph II were tenderly attached to one another and met frequently {{both before and after the}} death of their mother. The portrait by Pompeo Batoni in which they appear together shows that they bore a strong personal resemblance to one another. But it may be said of Leopold, as of Fontenelle, that his heart was made of brains. He knew that he had to succeed his childless eldest brother in Austria, and he was unwilling to inherit his unpopularity. When, therefore, in 1789 Joseph, who knew himself to be dying, asked him to come to Vienna and become co-regent, Leopold evaded the request.|$|E
500|$|The only gold man who put {{together}} {{any sort of}} campaign for the Democratic nomination was Treasury Secretary John G. Carlisle, but he withdrew in April, stating {{that he was more}} concerned about the platform of the party than who would lead it. However, as late as June, the gold forces, which still controlled the Democratic National Committee (DNC), continued to believe that the nominee could be pro-gold. Cleveland friend and former Postmaster General Donald M. Dickinson wrote to the President in June 1896 hoping that the delegates would recognize [...] "common sense" [...] and <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> at the thought of nominating a radical.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable {{responses}} [...] "I am not frightened of dying. [...] Any time will do: I don't mind. [...] Why should I <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> of dying? There's no reason for it– you've got to go sometime" [...] and closing words [...] "there is no dark side in the moon, really. [...] As {{a matter of fact}} it's all dark" [...] came from the studios' Irish doorman, Gerry O'Driscoll. [...] Paul and Linda McCartney were also interviewed, but their answers were judged to be [...] "trying too hard to be funny", and were not included on the album. [...] McCartney's Wings bandmate Henry McCullough contributed the line [...] "I don't know, I was really drunk at the time".|$|E
500|$|George and May {{had five}} {{sons and a}} daughter. Randolph Churchill claimed that George was a strict father, {{to the extent that}} his {{children}} were terrified of him, and that George had remarked to Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby: [...] "My father <b>was</b> <b>frightened</b> of his mother, I <b>was</b> <b>frightened</b> of my father, and I am damned well going {{to see to it that}} my children <b>are</b> <b>frightened</b> of me." [...] In reality, there is no direct source for the quotation and it is likely that George's parenting style was little different from that adopted by most people at the time.|$|R

500|$|Following {{the release}} of the Funny Lady soundtrack earlier in 1975, Streisand began work on Lazy Afternoon by collaborating with {{different}} producers, such as Jeffrey Lesser and Rupert Holmes. Because of the lackluster critical response generated from {{the release of}} her previous album, ButterFly (1974), and her personal dislike for the record, she had wished to collaborate with new musicians for the then-upcoming album. Holmes, in particular, was nervous while working with the singer. Following the completion of the album and in order to thank Holmes for their collaborations, Streisand hand-wrote him a note that read, [...] "Dear Rupert, don't <b>be</b> <b>frightened,</b> you're the best, love Barbra". Specifically, she was touched by the track [...] "My Father's Song", which she considered to be [...] "a very personal gift [...] mean a great to deal" [...] to her.|$|E
500|$|Although The Marble Index was {{generally}} unnoticed {{when it was}} released, it was praised by the countercultural East Village Other and International Times; however, most critics found [...] "her desolate soundscapes inaccessible." [...] Anne Marie Micklo of Rolling Stone gave the album a positive review, calling side two [...] "a really worthwhile venture into musical infinity". A cult following emerged around it, which included music journalist Lester Bangs, who wrote in a 1978 article entitled [...] "Your Shadow Is Scared of You: An Attempt Not to <b>Be</b> <b>Frightened</b> by Nico": [...] "The Marble Index is the greatest piece of 'avant-garde classical', 'serious' music of {{the last half of}} the 20th century so far." [...] Although Bangs praised the album, he also wrote that it [...] "scared the shit out of [...] " [...] and described the listening experience as [...] "self-torture".|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs and}} {{scenes from the}} show address racial issues. [...] "Colored Spade", which {{introduces}} the character Hud, a militant black male, is {{a long list of}} racial slurs ("jungle bunny... little black sambo") topped off with the declaration that Hud is the [...] "president of the United States of love". At the end of his song, he tells the tribe that the [...] "boogie man" [...] will get them, as the tribe pretends to <b>be</b> <b>frightened.</b> [...] "Dead End", sung by black tribe members, is a list of street signs that symbolize black frustration and alienation. One of the tribe's protest chants is [...] "What do we think is really great? To bomb, lynch and segregate!" [...] "Black Boys/White Boys" [...] is an exuberant acknowledgement of miscegenation; the U.S. Supreme Court had struck down laws against the practice in 1967. [...] Another of the tribe's protest chants is [...] "Black, white, yellow, red. Copulate in a king-sized bed." ...|$|E

500|$|... "My Father's Song" [...] was a {{brand new}} song {{recorded}} specifically for Streisand's seventeenth studio album, Lazy Afternoon (1975). Produced by Jeffrey Lesser and Rupert Holmes, the latter had written the song after Streisand had told him different stories about her childhood and growing up with her father; the songwriting process consisted of Streisand sharing personal tales of her father and what she felt about him. Streisand worked closely with Holmes during {{the creation of the}} album. Prior to their collaboration, Holmes was considered to be relatively unknown. After finishing up with Holmes and in order to thank him for the collaborations, Streisand hand-wrote him a note that read, [...] "Dear Rupert, don't <b>be</b> <b>frightened,</b> you're the best, love Barbra". In the official liner notes of Lazy Afternoon, she stated that the track was [...] "a very personal gift [...] mean a great to deal to me"; responding to her comments in a 1988 interview with a Streisand fan, Holmes claimed that the process was simple and that he had only [...] "put in [...] everything that a daughter might want to hear her father say" [...] in the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|In their {{analysis}} of the case, the journalists Simon Freeman and Barry Penrose state that Thorpe probably formed {{the outline of a}} plan to silence Scott early in 1974, after the latter's re-emergence became a matter of increasing concern. Holmes later said that Thorpe was insistent that Scott be killed: [...] " [...] he would never be safe with that man around". Uncertain how to proceed, late in 1974 Holmes approached a business acquaintance, a carpet salesman named John Le Mesurier (not {{to be confused with the}} actor of that name). Le Mesurier introduced Holmes to George Deakin, a fruit machine salesman who, he thought, would have contacts with people who might be prepared to deal with Scott. Holmes and Le Mesurier concocted a story involving a blackmailer who needed to <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> off; Deakin agreed to help. In February 1975 Deakin met Andrew Newton, an airline pilot, who said he was willing to deal with Scott for an appropriate fee—between £5,000 and £10,000 was suggested. Deakin put Newton in touch with Holmes. Newton always said that he had been hired to kill, not frighten, citing the size of the fee that he was offered—too much, he said, simply to scare someone.|$|E
500|$|With rehearsals due {{to begin}} in October 1873, Bizet began {{composing}} in or around January of that year, and by the summer had completed the music for the first act and perhaps sketched more. At that point, according to Bizet's biographer Winton Dean, [...] "some hitch at the Opéra-Comique intervened", and the project was suspended for a while. One reason for the delay {{may have been the}} difficulties in finding a singer for the title role. Another was a split that developed between the joint directors of the theatre, Camille du Locle and Adolphe de Leuven, over the advisability of staging the work. De Leuven had vociferously opposed the entire notion of presenting so risqué a story in what he considered a family theatre and was sure that audiences would <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> away. He was assured by Halévy that the story would be toned down, that Carmen's character would be softened, and offset by Micaëla, described by Halévy as [...] "a very innocent, very chaste young girl". Furthermore, the gypsies would be presented as comic characters, and Carmen's death would be overshadowed at the end by [...] "triumphal processions, ballets and joyous fanfares". De Leuven reluctantly agreed, but his continuing hostility towards the project led to his resignation from the theatre early in 1874.|$|E

500|$|Assault is {{a summary}} offence in England and Wales, {{with the case}} heard only at a Magistrates' Court. Although R v Little {{considered}} assault a statutory offence, none of the statutes referred to contain any definition of assault. The actus reus, endorsed in R v Ireland, is any act by D that causes V to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. The term [...] "force" [...] rather than [...] "violence" [...] {{is used by the}} Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). As a definition, this has proven stable, but its interpretation has varied. The force must be unlawful [...] outside the realm of defensive or preventative force, for example. Consent of the victim may be enough to prevent the commission of a crime. There is to debate as to whether lack of consent is an element of the actus reus, making it inherent to the commission of a crime, or whether consent is a defence. Andrew Simester and Bob Sullivan argue that the former is more correct, since lack on consent is vital to the crime; since the act may not constitute a harm even if enacted. The disregard for the victim's autonomy and privacy is the actionable part of the offence. The victim need not <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> by the apprehension of violence, merely not want the person concerned to do it.|$|E
500|$|... "Dead Celebrities" [...] makes {{frequent}} {{mention of}} the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant chain, describing the food as extremely tasty, but claiming it resulted in bloody stool. Shortly after the episode first aired, a Chipotle spokesperson said via a Twitter message that the claim was false. In the episode's commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone admitted that they loved Chipotle, but found it funnier to use a restaurant with a healthy reputation rather than a place like McDonald's or Taco Bell. Ike's ability to see the spirits of dead celebrities serves as a parody of the 1999 thriller film The Sixth Sense, which stars Haley Joel Osment {{as a young boy}} who can see ghosts. Ike's line, [...] "I see dead celebrities", is a reference to that film's most famous line, [...] "I see dead people." [...] The old lady psychic with a very high-pitched voice is a reference to the character played by Zelda Rubinstein in the 1982 horror film, Poltergeist. Another film reference is made to The Exorcist when the medium is flung from the window. [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] also mocks the Syfy reality television series Ghost Hunters by featuring the show's stars attempting to contact the celebrity spirits, only to <b>be</b> <b>frightened</b> and run away. Finally, the episode also parodies children's beauty pageants and the tendency of stage mothers to become unhealthily obsessed with their children winning such contests.|$|E
500|$|Eaton's combat {{career began}} inauspiciously, {{when he was}} shot down three times in the space of ten days. On the first occasion, his P-40 Kittyhawk was hit by 20mm cannon shells from an enemy fighter that he never saw. He later recalled, [...] "I was too busy getting the kite down to <b>be</b> <b>frightened.</b> But my God was I surprised." [...] Eaton brought his {{crippled}} aircraft in for a forced landing at El Hamma—in the midst of a tank battle between German and New Zealand forces. After the fighting had died down he made his way over to the New Zealanders, who gave him a lift back to his air base. The second time he was shot down, his plane was struck by 88mm anti-aircraft fire, necessitating another crash landing, this time behind enemy lines. Sympathetic Arab tribesmen smuggled him past the Germans and back to his airfield. Two days later, his P-40 was hit by fire from an Me109 that dived at him from out of the sun. He was able to glide back to base, [...] away, but on arriving found that it was under attack by German bombers. He decided he had no other option than to land the damaged plane among the exploding bombs, and managed to do so without mishap. His series of narrow escapes engendered a spirit of fatalism, and a habit of keeping his emotions severely in check while on duty: [...] "I just couldn't see myself living when so many were dying. It was something which, at the time, didn't bear much dwelling on." ...|$|E
