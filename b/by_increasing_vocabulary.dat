40|$|Second and 3 rd grade Honduran {{students}} in a Christian school are not performing at grade level in vocabulary. Students who lag in vocabulary development may not comprehend what they read {{and are likely to}} perform poorly in their course work, which may result in repeating the grade. As a result of the students 2 ̆ 7 poor performance, the school implemented vocabulary squares strategy instruction to improve vocabulary development. Guided by the theory of constructivism, the purpose of this casual comparative study was to determine if vocabulary squares strategy instruction resulted in greater word mastery for 2 nd and 3 rd grade Honduran students than did traditional vocabulary instruction. The control group (n = 16) received traditional vocabulary instruction, and the experimental group (n = 15) received vocabulary squares instruction for a period of 6 weeks. Analysis of gain score differences via an independent t test revealed no significant difference word mastery. The length of time the strategy instruction was implemented may have been insufficient to affect word mastery. It is recommended that teachers employ the vocabulary squares strategy more frequently and {{over a longer period of}} time to determine if vocabulary squares strategy instruction results in greater word mastery than traditional instruction. This practice may contribute to positive social change <b>by</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>vocabulary</b> development, which, in turn, affects students 2 ̆ 7 comprehension and course work performance reducing -the number of Honduran students repeating 2 nd or 3 rd grade...|$|E
40|$|Bag of Covariance {{matrices}} (BoC) {{have been}} recently introduced {{as an extension}} of the standard Bag of Words (BoW) to the space of positive semi-definite matrices, which has a Riemannian structure. BoC descriptors can be constructed with various Riemannian metrics and using various quantization approaches. Each construction results in some quantization errors, which are often reduced <b>by</b> <b>increasing</b> the <b>vocabulary</b> size. This, however, results in a signature that is not compact, increasing both the storage and computation complexity. This article demonstrates that a compact signature, with minimum distortion, can be constructed by using multiple vocabulary based coding. Each vocabulary is constructed from a different quantization method of the covariance feature space. The proposed method also extracts non-linear dependencies between the different BoC signatures to compose the final compact signature. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can boost the performance of the BoC descriptors in various 3 D shape classification and retrieval tasks...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop an}} {{interactive}} model of human memory called the Hebbian Recurrent Network (HRN) which integrates {{work in the}} mathematical modeling of memory with that in error correcting connectionist networks. It incorporates the Matrix Model (Pike, 1984) into the Simple Recurrent Network (SRN, Elman, 1989). The result is an architecture which has the desirable memory characteristics of the matrix model such as low interference and massive generalization, but which is able to learn appropriate encodings for items, decision criteria and the control functions of memory which have traditionally been chosen a priori in the mathematical memory literature. Simulations demonstrate that the HRN is well suited to a recognition task inspired by typical memory paradigms.

The action research was conducted in the fifth year of SD Negeri 1 Gondang. The writer taught vocabulary using storytelling. There were two cycles of action, each cycle consisted of planning, implementing, observing, and reflecting. In this research, the data are derived from used event, respondent, and document. There are three methods of collecting data namely: observation, interview, and content analysis. The result of the study shows that after the writer conducted the action, the students’ vocabulary mastery is higher than before. It {{can be seen from the}} result of both the observation of the students’ activities during the action and the mean of written and oral test in every action. Meanwhile, to find the significant difference between the students’ achievement before and after action, she used the nonindependent t-test. The result shows that the t-observation is always greater than the t-table in degrees of freedom N- 1 and level of significance 0, 05. It means that there is a significant difference of students’ achievement before and after action.

40|$|Background: For many {{allochthonous}} students Dutch is {{not their}} mother tongue. For this reason {{many of these students}} have a delay in Dutch language, which stands in the way of their school performance. Interventions are given to <b>increase</b> their <b>vocabulary</b> and to decrease that delay. Aim: The aim is to determine whether four interventions which <b>increase</b> <b>vocabulary</b> for allochthonous students are effective. The second aim is to gain more insight of the four interventions. Besides that, suggestions to improve the interventions are given. Method: 49 students (age 9 - 11) and their intervention teachers took part in this research. Data were collected using interviews for qualitative data, and the PPVT (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test), Raven SPM (Standard Progressive Matrices) and TBL (Toets Begrijpend Lezen) were used to collect quantitative data. An ANCOVA and ANOVA had been done to analyze the quantitative data. Results: The students in all four intervention groups <b>increased</b> their <b>vocabulary.</b> Intervention group A (after school intervention) <b>increased</b> their <b>vocabulary</b> the most. Looking at significant differences between the intervention groups, intervention group D (vocabulary class {{as a part of the}} daily program) turned out to have the highest score and significant differences where found with intervention group B and C (after school interventions).
