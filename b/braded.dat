40|$|Local strain {{fields in}} tri-axial braided {{composites}} arising {{in the vicinity}} of a saw cut due to the release of thermal processing stresses were experimentally measured by using moiré interferometry technique and compared to those obtained by 3 D stress analysis. The independent mesh method (IMM) and digital chain methods were used to perform the 3 D stress analysis and the composite tow morphology modeling respectively. A significant degree of morphological detail was required to achieve good comparison with experimental data. Three degrees of refinement were produced in direction of matching the actual morphology of the tri-axial <b>braded</b> composite which was tested experimentally. These levels of refinement included (i) correct tow path angle and curvature variation based on braid parameters (ii) addition of the effect of compaction process during the cure stage and (iii) addition of the surface sanding affects during moiré test preparation stage. The results obtained by using IMM were able to capture sharp variations of the strain components observed by using the moiré interferometric technique both in terms of spatial distribution and magnitude and provide accurate evaluation of the residual strain levels in the triaxial braided composites.

The authorised capital was £40,000. The company evidently found it difficult to raise the cash as the company was soon mortgaged to the House and Land Investment Trust Company Limited.

Around 1793, Hunt took W. Cliffe into partnership, and for a short period the firm was known as Hunt and Cliffe: this name appears in the company's first ledger, dated 9 May 1794.
