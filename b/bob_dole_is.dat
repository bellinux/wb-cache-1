50|$|Babka {{initially}} {{tried to}} get involved in some 1996 campaigns, and he did ultimately volunteer in one. But the Gingrich-led revolution stalled, and Babka was turned off by the GOP when they selected a big-government candidate, <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> to <b>be</b> the party nominee.|$|R

25|$|In 1995, {{a budget}} battle with Clinton {{led to the}} brief {{shutdown}} of the federal government, an event which contributed to Clinton's victory in the 1996 election.

40|$|In this study, respondents' {{attention}} was either drawn to Colin Powell's decision {{to join the}} Republican Party or to his decision not to run {{as a presidential candidate}} of this party before they began to evaluate the Republican Party or <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole.</b> When the Republican Party was first evaluated, thinking about Powell's party membership resulted in more favorable evaluations and thinking about his refusal to run as its candidate resulted in less favorable evaluations relative to a control condition. When <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>was</b> first evaluated, thinking of Powell always resulted in more negative evaluations. Moreover, carryover effects between both judgments were observed (i. e., initial judgments of the party affected subsequent judgments about Dole, and vice versa, in an additive manner). The results are consistent with predictions derived from Schwarz and Bless's inclusion/exclusion model of social judgment...|$|R
50|$|Kelly D. Johnston (born August 27, 1956) is {{a former}} Secretary of the United States Senate. He served as the 28th Secretary of the Senate and <b>was</b> {{nominated}} by <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> who <b>was</b> Senate Majority Leader at the time. He was the first Secretary of the Senate from Oklahoma and the second youngest ever chosen.|$|R
2500|$|Former Senate Majority Leader and 1996 Republican presidential {{candidate}} <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>was</b> {{a special counsel}} in the Washington office of the law firm Alston & Bird. DP World hired the firm in 2005 to help shepherd its purchase of the British-based firm Peninsular and Oriental. His wife, North Carolina Republican Senator Elizabeth Dole, has also {{raised questions about the}} Dubai-based company. The chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, Jerry Meek, publicly called on Sen. Dole to remove herself from [...] "any congressional oversight" [...] of the Dubai port deal and stated [...] "The fact that Dubai is paying her husband to help pass the deal presents both a financial and ethical conflict of interest for Senator Dole".|$|R
50|$|Following his {{decision}} not {{to run for president}} that year, Campbell was mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> but <b>was</b> ultimately passed over in favor of Jack Kemp, the former U.S. Representative from New York's 31st congressional district and later the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under the first President Bush.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, Didrickson was a {{candidate}} for the United States Senate. She was strongly supported in this bid by Governor Edgar and former Republican presidential nominee <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole.</b> The latter <b>was</b> her national campaign chairman.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, Kelikian {{served as}} chief {{orthopedic}} surgeon and lieutenant colonel at the 297th General Hospital. <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>was</b> {{one of his}} many patients, and Kelikian refused to accept any fees from the young veteran, since his brother Siragan had been killed in Italy in 1943. In total, Kelikian performed seven operations between 1947 and 1953 to restore the use of Dole's arm by transplanting leg bone and muscle to the right shoulder and hand. He saved the left arm of a young Victor A. Lundy, who would become a leading architect of the Sarasota Modern; Kelikian never discharged his patient, who would serve as his medical artist. Upon his return to Chicago, he joined the staff of Wesley Hospital and Northwestern Medical School.|$|R
5000|$|In 1960, John Anderson, {{one of the}} Young Turks, {{was elected}} governor, {{defeating}} McDill [...] "Huck" [...] Boyd, the party establishment's candidate, in the primary and Democrat George Docking, trying for a third term, in the general. This victory restored Republican control and consolidated a generational shift to new Republican leadership. The Republicans continued to hold both U.S. Senate seats, five of six Congressional seats, a gain of two, 32 State Senate seats, and gained 13 seats in the House. Anderson's campaign manager, James Pearson, became the State Party chair. The 1960 election <b>was</b> when <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>was</b> first elected to Congress {{with the support of}} his mentor McDill [...] "Huck" [...] Boyd and Dane Hansen, in the Sixth District - northwest Kansas.|$|R
50|$|After Nixon won the 1972 presidential election, Stone {{worked for}} the {{administration}} in the Office of Economic Opportunity. After Nixon resigned, Stone {{went to work for}} <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> but <b>was</b> later fired after columnist Jack Anderson publicly identified Stone as a Nixon 'dirty trickster.' In 1976, he worked in Ronald Reagan's campaign for president, and in 1977, became national chairman of the Young Republicans.|$|R
5000|$|Ahead of the 1996 primary contest, Republican Leader of the United States Senate {{and former}} vice-presidential {{candidate}} <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>was</b> {{seen as the}} most likely winner, nearly 20 years after losing the Vice Presidency to Democrat Walter Mondale. However, Steve Forbes finished first in Delaware and Arizona while paleoconservative firebrand Pat Buchanan managed early victories in Alaska and Louisiana, {{in addition to a}} strong second place in the Iowa caucuses and a surprising victory in the small but key New Hampshire primary. Buchanan's New Hampshire win alarmed the Republican [...] "establishment" [...] sufficiently as to provoke prominent Republicans to quickly coalesce around Dole, and Dole won every primary starting with North and South Dakota. Dole resigned his Senate seat on June 11 and the Republican National Convention formally nominated Dole on August 15, 1996 for President.|$|R
50|$|During the 2016 presidential campaign, Paul Ryan was {{reported}} to have considered a possible presidential bid for the 2020 election, if President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence do not seek re-election. This could make Ryan the first president from Wisconsin as well as the second House Speaker to later serve as president, the first being James K. Polk in 1845. Additionally Ryan would also be the first person since <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> to <b>be</b> nominated for both President and Vice President two different elections (<b>Dole</b> <b>was</b> the vice presidential nominee in 1976 and the presidential nominee in 1996).|$|R
50|$|Going {{into the}} 1996 primary contest, Senate Majority Leader <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>was</b> {{widely seen as}} the front runner. Dole had {{significant}} name recognition, as he was a two time presidential candidate - in 1980 and 1988, and Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1976. He was expected {{to win the nomination}} against underdog candidates such as the more conservative U.S. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and more centrist U.S. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. The fragmented field of candidates, which also included journalist and 1992 presidential candidate Pat Buchanan and magazine publisher Steve Forbes, debated issues such as a flat tax and other tax cut proposals, and a return to supply-side economic policies popularized by Ronald Reagan. More attention was drawn to the race by the budget stalemate in 1995 between the Congress and the President, which caused temporary shutdowns and slowdowns in many areas of federal government service.|$|R
50|$|Stanley Meisler, biographer of Kofi Annan, {{writes that}} Boutros Ghali's {{reluctance}} {{to bomb the}} Serbs in Bosnia stemmed from French and British opposition to the tactic, as both countries had provided most of the UN peacekeepers and feared that the Serbs would retaliate against their soldiers. Meisler instead suggests that Clinton sought to veto Boutros Ghali's second term to increase his own popularity, as Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> who <b>was</b> running against Clinton in 1996, had gotten a few votes by repeatedly denouncing Boutros-Ghali vehemently.|$|R
50|$|Currently Sampson County leans {{strongly}} {{towards the}} Republican Party in presidential elections. No Democratic presidential candidate has gained an absolute majority of Sampson County’s votes {{in a presidential}} election since Jimmy Carter did so in 1980, although Bill Clinton won a plurality in 1992 and <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole’s</b> 1996 plurality <b>was</b> just ninety-one votes out of over seventeen thousand.|$|R
50|$|Bio Fuel Incentives: In {{addition}} to his responsibilities involving the U.S. Constitution, Ackerson also served as Senator Birch Bayh’s advisor on agricultural policy. In that role, Ackerson proposed the first legislation passed by Congress and enacted into law to provide incentives {{for the production of}} alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. The law was co-authored on a bipartisan basis by Democratic Senator Bayh and Republican Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> and <b>is</b> credited with much of the early success in the development and use of alternative, environmentally sound and economically beneficial fuels from biological sources.|$|R
5000|$|Bush's running mate, however, {{would not}} be {{revealed}} until August 16, allowing speculation to intensify {{all the way to}} the national convention. <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> who <b>was</b> considered a leading contender based on his second-place finish in the primaries, expressed impatience with the wait but nonetheless made plain his keen desire for the job. So too did Jack Kemp, who confidently told reporters that he would make [...] "a terrific campaigner and a terrific candidate and a terrific vice president". Both men were thought to rank high on Bush's list of potential picks.|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} at the NRSC, Hensley spent three months in Portland, Oregon, working to elect {{businessman}} Gordon Smith, and wrote many speeches, including South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond's final campaign re-election announcement. The NRSC in this cycle faced several challenges beyond its control, many emanating from the two dominant Republicans of 1995-96, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole.</b> Gingrich <b>was</b> turned by Democrats into a pariah {{through much of the}} country (2-to-1 unfav-fav ratio in surveys); Dole frittered away an early lead, resigned from the Senate to campaign full-time, and eventually polled less than 41% nationwide.|$|R
5000|$|George H. W. Bush won the Iowa caucus in 1980, {{leading him}} {{to claim that}} he had [...] "Big Mo" [...] (momentum) over frontrunner Ronald Reagan. However, Reagan won the New Hampshire primary and several others to take the nomination. In the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, Bush, serving as Reagan's vice president, {{unexpectedly}} finished third in Iowa which <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> won. <b>Dole</b> <b>was</b> also leading in New Hampshire polls but ended up losing that primary as he failed to counterattack ads from Bush. Bush had no serious trouble clinching the nomination afterward.|$|R
5000|$|When Montgomery joined MTV in 1992, {{she said}} “I didn’t dare out {{myself as a}} conservative” in her early months at MTV. At MTV’s 1993 Rock ’n’ Roll Inaugural Ball for Bill Clinton, she chanted, [...] "Nixon now! Nixon now!”, {{whenever}} the Clintons went on stage. Along with being a fan of Richard Nixon, she supported Dan Quayle and <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole.</b> [...] She <b>was</b> also a speaker at the 1996 Republican National Convention.|$|R
