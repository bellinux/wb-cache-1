40|$|Timely and {{accurate}} information on natural resources are pre-requisite for optimum and effective management of natural resources. Remote sensing technology is now established and widely accepted {{all over the}} world. Subsequent improvements in the spatial and spectral resolution and better temporal resolution help not only in mapping and monitoring natural resources and environmental degradation at regional and local scales but also provide database for newer area of application. The successful launch of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellites (IRS) series and application in natural resource management and other studies is a new milestone {{in the development of}} potential of land cover mapping and estimation in the world over. Coarse resolution satellite data as of NOAA-AVHRR are widely used for vegetation characterisation at regional level. The IRS- 1 C/ 1 D-WiFS data have an advantage of covering large area in single instant field of view (IFOV) avoiding any illumination differences and having good spectral and spatial resolution and recommended temporal resolution for optimum land cover studies. Biome or ecosystem level zonation provides information as per <b>biogeographical</b> <b>map,</b> essential for understanding subsequent eco-physiological processes. An attempt has been made for regional level classification of arid zone in Western part of India using WiFS data, keeping in view the national development needs vis-à-vis advancement expected in the future indigenous and internationa...|$|E
40|$|Background: Characterizing the {{biogeography}} of the microbiome {{of healthy}} humans {{is essential for}} understanding microbial associated diseases. Previous studies mainly focused on a single body habitat from a limited set of subjects. Here, we analyzed {{one of the largest}} microbiome datasets to date and generated a <b>biogeographical</b> <b>map</b> that annotates the biodiversity, spatial relationships, and temporal stability of 22 habitats from 279 healthy humans. Results: We identified 929 genera from more than 24 million 16 S rRNA gene sequences of 22 habitats, and we provide a baseline of inter-subject variation for healthy adults. The oral habitat has the most stable microbiota with the highest alpha diversity, while the skin and vaginal microbiota are less stable and show lower alpha diversity. The level of biodiversity in one habitat is independent of the biodiversity of other habitats in the same individual. The abundances of a given genus at a body site in which it dominates do not correlate with the abundances at body sites where it is not dominant. Additionally, we observed the human microbiota exhibit both cosmopolitan and endemic features. Finally, comparing datasets of different projects revealed a project-based clustering pattern, emphasizing the significance of standardization of metagenomic studies. Conclusions: The data presented here extend the definition of the human microbiome by providing a more complete and accurate picture of human microbiome biogeography, addressing questions best answered by a large dataset of subjects and body sites that are deeply sampled by sequencing...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} map the spatial {{distribution}} of twenty tree species groups over Europe at 1 km × 1 km resolution, the ICP-Forest Level-I plot data were extended with the National Forest Inventory (NFI) plot data of eighteen countries. The NFI grids have a much smaller spacing than the ICP grid. In areas with NFI plot data, the proportions of the land area covered by the tree species were mapped by compositional kriging. Outside these areas, these proportions were mapped with a multinomial multiple logistic regression model. A soil map, a <b>biogeographical</b> <b>map</b> and bioindicators derived from temperature and precipitation data were used as predictors. Both methods ensure that the predicted proportions are in the interval [0, 1] and sum to 1. The regression predictions were iteratively scaled to the National Forest Inventory statistics and the Forest map of Europe. The predicted proportions for the twenty tree species were validated by the Bhattacharryya distance between predicted and observed proportions at 230 plot data separated from the calibration data. Besides, the map with the predicted dominant species was validated by computing the error matrix. The median Bhattacharryya distance in the subarea with NFI plot data was 1. 712, whereas in the subarea with ICP-Level-I data, this was 2. 131. The scaling did not significantly decrease the Bhattacharryya distance. The estimated overall accuracy of this map was 43 %. In areas with NFI plot data, overall accuracy was 57 %, outside these areas 33 %. This gain was mainly attributable to the much denser plot data, less to the prediction method...|$|E

Materials and methods. Map is based on the classification of terrestrial ecosystems (biomes) and eco-geographical approach to their subordination on different levels of organization of the biotic cover. Results. We have displayed on the map the differentiation of the country on the composition of ecosystems and their biodiversity at the regional level. Biomes at the regional level are central to the study and are mapping units. Legend includes 35 lowland biomes and 31 orobiomes (in the mountains). A characteristic has been made up for each biome, which includes indicators of moisture and heat supply, the number of species of vascular plants, mosses and lichens, terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians). To illustrate this, there is the characteristic of the 3 orobiomes of the North Caucasus. Conclusion. Using biomes as supporting biodiversity accounting units enables the integrated analysis of botanical and zoogeographic information about biota, as well as the dual study of biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem. The current state of biomes is defined by two interrelated processes of transformation and modification of ecosystems and the reduction or loss of biological diversity. Map of regional biomes can serve as a basis for further research on the biome biodiversity on species and ecosystem levels; as the inventory of the biota and the creation of databases on species and cenotic diversity of biomes; for the development and justification of environmental protection measures. </p...|$|E
40|$|At {{the start}} of the third millennium, new {{opportunities}} have arisen in biogeographical research, namely in the generalisation, visualisation and cross-spectrum analysis of biological and geographical information and in the compilation of <b>biogeographical</b> <b>maps</b> and innovative models for regions that differ in the availability of distribution data. These tasks include long-term monitoring of plants and animals which are in danger of extinction, geographical analysis of biodiversity distribution and development of effective wildlife conservation strategies for specific regions. The studies of the Department of Biogeography of Moscow University on geography and biodiversity conservation are based on long-term field expeditions. The examples of the Asian Subarctic Mountains, the steppes of Central Kazakhstan and the urbanised north-west of Russia are used to illustrate Russian approaches to the use of biogeographical monitoring for the identification of priority areas for biodiversity conservation.

40|$|The McMurdo Dry Valley lakes of Antarctica {{constitute}} some of {{the harshest}} and most isolated freshwater environments on Earth which {{might be expected to}} limit the biogeographical expansion of many organisms. Despite this, we found that the biodiversity of rotifer zooplankton is the highest ever recorded on the Antarctic mainland. We identified in total nine rotifer taxa, of which six are new to the Antarctic continent, in Lake Hoare, and also the first sub- adult crustacean copepod belonging to the genus Boeckella. A possible explanation for the high biodiversity {{is that many of the}} recorded species have arrived in the region in relatively recent times and then established invasive populations, suggesting that their distribution pattern was previously limited only by biogeographical borders. Interestingly, we show that the cosmopolitan rotifer taxa identified are relatively abundant, suggesting that they have established viable populations.

40|$|As {{the ecology}} and {{distribution}} of most tree species remain poorly understood, <b>biogeographical</b> <b>maps</b> offer spatial surrogates for analysis of biodiversity patterns. We used a 1 : 250, 000 potential natural vegetation map to compare the current indigenous tree species composition of 250 0. 5 -ha quadrats surveyed around Mount Kenya (1999 – 2004) with the original species composition of ten poten-tial natural vegetation types (PNVTs). The original 1960 vegetation map was based on intensive fieldwork and detailed aerial photographs by Trapnell et al. For each PNVT, we compiled original species lists from literature and her-barium voucher information. The percentage of species that overlap between the current list and the original list ranged from 30 % to 75 % for seven frequent PNVTs, but was only above 45 % for dry Combretum savanna (DC). When only investigating the six to ten species with highest frequencies, these species were shared 70 – 100 % for the four forest PNVTs, 90 % for lowland Acacia-Commiphora, 67 % for evergreen and semi-evergreen bushland and 50 % for DC savanna. To promote agroecosystem diversification, ecological and socio-economic reasons for low current frequencies of most indigenous tree species need to be better understood...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen {{strawberry}} tree natural populations in different ecological conditions were sampled, ca. 30 trees per stand. Our aims were {{to investigate the}} genetic structure the species, and to disclose the historical demographic processes shaping the genetic structure. The obtained information {{will be used in}} the species improvement and in the design and management of conservation programs. Fifteen haplotypes were obtained after screening the individuals with four chloroplast microsatellites. Four clusters were identified using BAPS analysis. A “northern”, a “central”, a “southern”, and a four cluster with a single population. The hierarchical AMOVA showed a stronger differentiation among clusters than among populations within clusters. The relatively low among populations within clusters differentiation could be explained by the common postglacial history of nearby populations, which might also be connected through bird-mediated seed flow. The species was also ecologically characterized in the Centre region, using bioclimatology, lithology, topography, soil type, vegetation and wildfires records. The data processed was the digital terrain model (DTM), mapping soils, burnt areas perimeters and phytosociological and <b>biogeographical</b> <b>maps.</b> Climatological data was used to calculate bioclimatic indices. Exploratory multivariate statistical analysis with the gathered data was performed: a principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Chagas {{disease control}} {{strategies}} strongly {{depend on the}} triatomine vector species involved in Trypanosoma cruzi transmission within each area. Here we report {{the results of the}} identification of specimens belonging to various species of Triatominae captured in Ecuador (15 species from 17 provinces) and deposited in the entomological collections of the Catholic University of Ecuador (Quito), Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (Brazil), the Natural History Museum London (UK), the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (UK), the National Institute of Hygiene (Quito), and the Vozandes Hospital (Quito). A critical review of published information and new field records are presented. We analysed these data in relation to the life zones where triatomines occur (11 life zones, excluding those over 2, 200 m altitude), and provide <b>biogeographical</b> <b>maps</b> for each species. These records are discussed in terms of epidemiological significance and design of control strategies. Findings relevant to the control of the main vector species are emphasised. Different lines of evidence suggest that Triatoma dimidiata is not native to Ecuador-Peru, and that synanthropic populations of Rhodnius ecuadoriensis in southern Ecuador-northern Peru might be isolated from their sylvatic conspecifics. Local eradication of T. dimidiata and these R. ecuadoriensis populations might therefore be attainable. However, the presence {{of a wide variety of}} native species indicates the necessity for a strong longitudinal surveillance system...|$|R
40|$|Strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.) {{displays}} {{potential to}} be successfully businesslike cultured in several regions of Portugal and southern Europe, where it is well adapted to climate and soils. In Portugal, this species {{has been used by}} local populations for fruit consumption and spirit production, but remains largely a neglected crop. It has different possible commercial uses, since processed and fresh fruit production to ornamental, pharmaceutical and chemical applications, due to the phenolic acids and terpenoid compounds with strong antioxidant activity, vitamin C and tannin content. In addition, due to its pioneer status, it is valuable for land recovery and desertification avoidance, besides being fire resistant. Currently, the demand for improved plants has strongly increased. Under the project ARBUTUS (PTDC/AGR-FOR/ 3746 / 2012, Arbutus unedo plants and products quality improvement for the agro-forestry sector) 30 trees were selected, in 15 natural populations distributed throughout the country. The stands were ecologically characterized locally, using bioclimatology, lithology, topography, soil type, vegetation and wildfires records, as biophysical units.

40|$|Abstract The most {{effective}} way of mapping species diversity, is to choose an abundant, sedentary, small and widespread taxon, such as rodents are. At present, thanks to a recent improvement of karyology and genetics, knowledge is growing faster at the macro - regional level than at the local level. This {{is due to a}} delay in assessing the whole territory. In fact new findings often come from one or very few and small localities. This implies new problems in mapping species richness. Indeed today, even less than in the past, Richness can be evaluated directly by the crude species number, without any kind of standardisation of data a/o weighing. A study of maps of Italian rodents has shown that the more up to date the maps are, the more they coincide with theoretical calculations based on consolidated ecological and <b>biogeographical</b> rules. Richness <b>maps</b> (i. e., weighted and standardised species number) show an even more satisfactory representation of the general geo-ecological outline of the Italian peninsula and its subpeninsulae...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —This study {{uses the}} {{amphibian}} {{species of the}} Mediterranean basin to develop a consistent procedure based on fuzzy sets with which biogeographic regions and biotic transition zones can be objectively detected and reliably <b>mapped.</b> <b>Biogeographical</b> regionalizations are abstractions of the geographical organization of life on Earth that provide frameworks for cataloguing species and ecosystems, for answering basic questions in biogeography, evolutionary biology, and systematics, and for assessing priorities for conservation. On the other hand, limits between regions may form sharply defined boundaries along some parts of their borders, whereas elsewhere they may consist of broad transition zones. The fuzzy set approach provides a heuristic way to analyse {{the complexity of the}} biota within an area; significantly different regions are detectedwhosemutual limits are sometimes fuzzy, sometimes clearly crisp. Most of the regionalizations described in the literature for the Mediterranean biogeographical area present a certain degree of convergence when they are compared within the context of fuzzy interpretation, as many of the differences found between regionalizations are located in transition zones, according to our case study. Compared with other classification procedures based on fuzzy sets, the novelty of our method is that both fuzzy logic and statistics are used together in a synergy in order to avoid arbitrary decisions in the definition of biogeographic regions and transition zones.

40|$|Neben biogeographischen werden morphologische Argumente zusammengetragen, die für eine Synonymisierung der Arten Acalles parvulus Boheman, 1837 = Acalles temperei Péricart, 1987 sprechen. Entlang eines Transekts zwischen dem Mont Pilat (Dep. Loire) und dem Mont Saint-Martin nördlich von Grenoble (Dep. Isère) wird über den Vergleich der Aedoeagi eine Cline sichtbar, die am Artstatus von Acalles temperei zweifeln lässt. Bestätigung finden diese vergleichenden, phänotypischen Untersuchungen durch erste molekulargenetische Untersuchungen. Danach scheint entweder eine Hybridisierungszone wahrscheinlich oder der Verdacht liegt nahe, dass Acalles parvulus und Acalles temperei eine einzige, geographisch strukturierte Art darstellen. Völlig anders liegen die molekularbiologischen Ergebnisse bei Kyklioacalles roboris (Curtis, 1834) und der erst kürzlich resynonymisierten Art Kyklioacalles navieresi (Boheman, 1837) : Die DNA-Sequenzanalysen der mitochondrialen CO 1 - und 16 S-Gene sowie des nukleären 28 S-Gens zeigen, dass Kyklioacalles navieresi und Kyklioacalles roboris zwei eigenständige, wenn auch eng verwandte Arten darstellen.
