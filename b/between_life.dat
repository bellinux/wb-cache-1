5|$|The {{event was}} widely {{cited as the}} trigger event for July 2009 Ürümqi riots, which ostensibly started as a {{peaceful}} street protest demanding official action over the two Uyghurs who died in Shaoguan. Following trials in October 2009, one person was executed and several others sentenced to terms <b>between</b> <b>life</b> imprisonment and five to seven years.|$|E
5|$|Up {{through the}} 19th century, {{the scope of}} biology was largely divided between medicine, which {{investigated}} questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of life and interactions among different forms of life and <b>between</b> <b>life</b> and non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart natural philosophy) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines—cytology, bacteriology, morphology, embryology, geography, and geology.|$|E
5|$|Amonkhet has The Gatewatch set out {{to destroy}} the evil dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas after {{learning}} of his dominion over the titular desert plane Amonkhet. In the desert, they find a city (Naktamun) teeming with food, water, and life, ruled by five gods, with Bolas seemingly absent altogether. The people of Naktamun train their entire lives to die in ritual combat, hoping to experience pure bliss in the afterlife when the God-Pharaoh (Bolas) returns to Amonkhet. In Hour of Devastation, Bolas returns as prophesied, only to raze Naktamun and reveal the true purpose of the training and combat: to create an army of physically-perfect and combat-adept mummies {{to serve as an}} unquestionably loyal army. The block's setting is based ancient Egypt, with themes of social hierarchy and contrast <b>between</b> <b>life</b> and death.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} the relationship <b>between</b> work <b>life</b> balance and employees‘ work performance with special reference to insurance companies in Kilinochchi District. This research is carried out {{to identify}} relationship <b>between</b> work <b>life</b> balance and employee work performance {{with the use of}} questionnaire and other secondary source by analyzing reliability test, univariate and bivariate analysis. The result suggested that there is a positive relationship <b>between</b> work <b>life</b> balance and employees‘ work performance. The result of correlation analysis <b>between</b> the work <b>life</b> balance and employees‘ work performance indicates that there is a strong positive correlation <b>between</b> work <b>life</b> balance and employees‘ work performance with the r value of 0. 538. According to the simple regression analysis, when the work life balance increases the employees‘ work performance also increases in the insurance companies. Further, when the organization considers the improvement in the work life balance, it will lead to maintain high level employees‘ work performance in the insurance companies. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era. Wirt and Greg's strange appearance {{stems from the fact}} that the night they entered the Unknown was Halloween. Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry tape he made for a girl he likes, had followed her to a graveyard scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden wall. On the other side of the wall, they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a Limbo-like realm <b>between</b> <b>life</b> and death.|$|E
5|$|La tragedia del silencio {{does not}} address political, social, or {{economic}} topics, nor different cultural aspects such as the lifestyle of the Colombian population. Acevedo did not intend for the film to create controversy, so it does not mention the situation in Colombia, {{the plot of the}} film instead focusing narrowly on one man's struggle <b>between</b> <b>life</b> and death. Although leprosy is the main theme of the film, there are other storylines that follow different protagonists and their motivations, such as the husband learning he must face his destiny when he learns about his disease, which requires him to separate from his family. After learning he does not have leprosy, he most confront a rival (the student) to regain the love of his wife.|$|E
5|$|Shiva-related {{literature}} developed extensively across India in the 1st millennium CE {{and through}} the 13th century, particularly in Kashmir and Tamil Shaiva traditions. The monist Shiva literature posit absolute oneness, that is Shiva is within every man and woman, Shiva is within every living being, Shiva is present {{everywhere in the world}} including all non-living being, and there is no spiritual difference <b>between</b> <b>life,</b> matter, man and Shiva. The various dualistic and monist Shiva-related ideas were welcomed in medieval southeast Asia, inspiring numerous Shiva-related temples, artwork and texts in Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, with syncretic integration of local pre-existing theologies.|$|E

5|$|Time {{is viewed}} as unredeemable and problematic, whereas eternity is {{beautiful}} and true. Living under time's influence is a problem. Within Burnt Norton section 3, people trapped in time {{are similar to those}} stuck in <b>between</b> <b>life</b> and death in Inferno Canto Three. When Eliot deals with the past in The Dry Salvages, he emphasises its importance to combat the influence of evolution as encouraging people to forget the past and care only about the present and the future. The present is capable of always reminding one of the past. These moments also rely on the idea of Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita that death can come at any moment, and that the divine will is more important than considering the future.|$|E
5|$|One major {{manifestation of}} the North–South divide is in health and life {{expectancy}} statistics. All three Northern England statistical regions have lower than average life expectancies and higher than average rates of cancer, circulatory disease and respiratory disease. Blackpool has the lowest life expectancy at birth in England – male life expectancy at birth between 2012 and 2014 was 74.7, against an England-wide average of 79.5 – {{and the majority of}} English districts in the bottom 50 were in the North East or the North West. However, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991–1993 and 2012–2014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap <b>between</b> <b>life</b> expectancy in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993.|$|E

25|$|According to Hindu belief, death {{happens on}} two levels: a {{physical}} death and a ritual death.

The corpse used for shava sadhana thus in an intermediate stage <b>between</b> <b>life</b> and death.|$|E

25|$|Democritus (460 BC) {{thought that}} the {{essential}} characteristic of life is having a soul (psyche). Like other ancient writers, he was attempting to explain what makes something a living thing.

He elaborates on fire because of the apparent connection <b>between</b> <b>life</b> and heat, and because fire moves.|$|E

Computer-aided auscultation is sensitive to external noise and bodily sounds and requires an almost silent environment to function accurately.|$|E

If the enemy was trapped in adverse terrain, such as a simple village surrounded by open ground, normally no-one escaped unless it was near nightfall.|$|E
