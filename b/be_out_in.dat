25|$|The bowler is {{credited}} in the statistics with having taken a wicket if the batsman is out bowled, LBW, caught, stumped, or hit wicket. If {{the ball is}} a no ball then the batsman cannot <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> any of these ways.

Ajit Agarkar was the first man to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the morning to Andy Bichel, and then he was followed by Parthiv Patel, whose ill-fated, top-edged hook was caught by a diving Bichel off Gillespie. The two batsmen departed without India adding any run to their score. At 362/8, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh had a fine outing with the bat. Zaheer swatted a six and three boundaries in his 27 and Harbhajan hit 19 in his own inimitable fashion, as India pushed along to 409. They had obtained a lead of 86– a rarity in Australia against Australia itself. Moreover, this achievement was significant because India were written off before the match even began.|$|E

500|$|Numerous {{news outlets}} started {{reporting}} on the concert tour supporting Rebel Heart. The Italian newspaper Torino Today reported Madonna was planning on returning to Turin with the tour on November 20 and 21, 2015. The tour was called the Rebel Heart Tour with appearances in North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania, beginning on September 9, 2015. Billboard reported that the tour would use arenas only, and would visit cities where Madonna had not performed previously. The initial itinerary had 25–30 shows in North America and 20–25 shows in Europe, with additional dates being revealed later on. This tour was the singer's first visit to Australia in more than 20 years, having last toured there with The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993, and her first time performing in New Zealand and the Philippines. The tour's main stage was elevated and set {{up at the end}} of each arena, with a long catwalk extending from its middle to the center of the space. At the middle of the catwalk there was a circular stage, while the far end of the pathway ended in a heart-shaped stage. Designers working on the tour's wardrobe included: Jeremy Scott for Moschino, Alessandro Michele for Gucci and Alexander Wang, along with Fausto Puglisi, Prada, Miu Miu, Swarovski, Lebanese designer Nicolas Jebran, as well as Madonna's longtime collaborator Arianne Phillips. The tour generated positive critical reviews, many noting that Madonna appeared to be in a happy mood onstage. It grossed a total of $169.8 million from 82 shows, with over 1.045 million ticket sales. In March 2016, Madonna announced that the Sydney, Australia shows of March 19 and 20, 2016 would be filmed for a tour DVD release. Danny B.
