40|$|AbstractThe stage-discharge {{rating curve}} {{is widely used}} in the {{research}} for analysis of flow regime and design of hydraulic structure and river channel. To develop the reliable stage-discharge rating curve, numerous discharge data from the lowest to <b>bankful</b> <b>stage</b> should be observed {{over a long period}} of time. The river environment and topography of Nakdong River in Korea has been changed drastically due to the Four Major Rivers Restoration Project from the end of 2009 to 2012. Moreover, 8 weirs were built dividing the main river into nine sectors and it led the discontinuous flow and backwater effect for each sector. In such situations, the stage-discharge rating curve should be re-determined with new data for the changed topography and flow characteristics. However, it takes long time to get the new stage-discharge rating curve. In this study, the alternative stage-discharge rating curve was developed using the Hydraulic Performance Graph (HPG). HPG is a plot summarizing all the backwater profile for all possible discharge at a channel reach based on the flow equation that is derived from the energy equation. In this study, the 26 cross sections up to a length of 12. 3 km located between Gangjung weir and Dalsung weir in Nakdong River after the project were measured. The HPG for this sector was created. Using the results of discharge and water surface elevation from the HPG, the alternative stage-discharge rating curve was created. Then the discharge from the rating curve was compared with measured data from the several cross sections. The discharge from the rating curve matched the measured data quite well. The alternative stage-discharge rating curve suggested in this study has high applicability for analysis of flow regime and design of hydraulic structure and river channel in drastic environmental changes of the river systems before creating a new stage-discharge rating curve which requires long term measurement data...|$|E
40|$|Sounding of the {{sea floor}} in front of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica {{recently}} revealed large persistent patterns of longitudinal megaflutes and drumlinoid forms, which are interpreted to have formed at the base of ice streams during the list glacial advance. The flutes bear remarkable resemblance to longitudinal grooves and highly elongated streamlined islands found on the floors of some large martian channels, called outflow channels. ln addition, other similarities exist between Antarctic ice streams and outflow channels. Ice streams are 30 to 80 km wide and hundreds of kilometers long, as are the martian channels. Ice stream beds are below sea level. Floors of many martian outflow channels lie below martian datum, which may have been close to or below past martian sea levels. The Antarctic ice stream bed gradient is flat and locally may go uphill, and surface slopes are exceptionally low. So are gradients of martian channels. The depth to the bed in ice streams is 1 to 1. 5 km. At <b>bankful</b> <b>stage,</b> the depth of the fluid in outflow channels would have been 1 to 2 km. These similarities suggest that the martian outflow channels, whose origin is commonly attributed to gigantic catastrophic floods, were locally filled by ice that left a conspicuous morphologic imprint. Unlike the West-Antarctic-ice streams, which discharge ice from an ice sheet, ice in the martian channels came from water erupting from the ground. In the cold martian environment, this water, if of moderate volume, would eventually freeze. Thus it may have formed icings on springs, ice dams and jams on constrictions in the channel path, or frozen pools. Given sufficient thickness and downhill surface gradient, these ice masses would have moved; and given the right conditions, they could have moved like Antarctic ice streams...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} ice streams in Antarctica reveal a {{mechanism}} of basal motion that may apply to channels and valleys on Mars. The mechanism is sliding {{of the ice}} on deformable water-saturated till under high pore pressures. It has been suggested by Lucchitta that ice was present in outflow channels on Mars and gave them their distinctive morphology. This ice may have slid like Antarctic ice streams but on rubbly weathering products rather than till. However, to generate water under high pore pressures, elevated heatflow is needed to melt {{the base of the}} ice. Either volcanism or higher heatflow more than 2 b. y. ago could have raised the basal temperature. Regarding valley networks, higher heatflow 3 b. y. ago could have allowed sliding of ice-saturated overburden at a few hundred meters depth. If the original, pristine valleys were somewhat deeper than they are now, they could have formed by the same mechanism. Recent sounding of the seafloor in front of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica reveals large persistent patterns of longitudinal megaflutes and drumlinoid forms, which bear remarkable resemblance to longitudinal grooves and highly elongated streamlined islands found on the floors of martian outflow channels. The flutes are interpreted to have formed at the base of ice streams during the last glacial advance. Additional similarities of Antarctic ice streams with martian outflow channels are apparent. Antarctic ice streams are 30 to 80 km wide and hundreds of kilometers long. Martian outflow channels have similar dimensions. Ice stream beds are below sea level. Carr determined that most common floor elevations of martian outflow channels lie below martian datum, which may have been close to or below past martian sea levels. The Antarctic ice stream bed gradient is flat and locally may go uphill, and surface slopes are exceptionally. Martian channels also have floor gradients that are shallow or go uphill locally and have low surface gradients. The depth to the bed in ice streams is 1 to 1. 5 km. At <b>bankful</b> <b>stage,</b> the depth of the fluid in outflow channels was 1 to 2 km, according to the height of bordering scarps. The similarity between Antarctic ice streams and martian outflow channels suggests that ice may have flowed through and shaped the outflow channels, and that perhaps the mechanism of motion of Antarctic ice streams also operated in outflow channels. In addition, sliding on deformable rubble may explain the formation of small valley networks. The large Siple Coast Antarctic ice streams are thought to slide over longitudinally grooved, deforming till, where much of the movement is within the till. The till is saturated with water at high pore pressures that nearly supports all of the weight of the ice. The small differential between overburden pressure and pore pressure at the bed {{is more important than the}} volume of water, but water needs to be supplied to the till interface. For pore pressures to remain high, the ice streams have to act as a seal that blocks the flow of water through them, and the rock underneath has to be of low permeability to prevent the water from draining away...|$|E
