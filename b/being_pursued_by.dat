5|$|Despite the Great Depression, Silverman's travels {{expanded}} in the 1930s, {{when she began}} spending 6 months each year outside the U.S. As early as 1932, land purchase programs to buy and settle refugees on permanent homes in Palestine were <b>being</b> <b>pursued</b> <b>by</b> Jewish organizations. Silverman not only supported the plans and raised funds for them, but she planted the first tree in the colony at Wady Havarith. With Hitler's rise to power, Silverman's pleas for {{a safe haven for}} Jews became more urgent and her first-hand reports from Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania, and Poland contained explicit accounts of conditions. In 1938, Silverman was working with the Youth Aliyah Movement in conjunction with Hadassah in the U.S. to relocate 10,000 refugee children to Palestine. As a fund-raiser, Silverman's goal was to raise {{a quarter of a million}} dollars for resettlement and youth training in agricultural and vocational pursuits. In 1939, she ended her Polish tour studying the conditions and desperation, shortly before the Polish invasion, but the effort was successful in relocating some 7,000 young people from Poland, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Romania to Palestine before the end of 1940.|$|E
5|$|General-in-Chief He Jin (d.189 AD), {{half-brother}} to Empress He (d. 189 AD), plotted with Yuan Shao (d.202 AD) {{to overthrow}} the eunuchs by having several generals march {{to the outskirts of}} the capital. There, in a written petition to Empress He, they demanded the eunuchs' execution. After a period of hesitation, Empress He consented. When the eunuchs discovered this, however, they had her brother He Miao (何苗) rescind the order. The eunuchs assassinated He Jin on September 22, 189 AD. Yuan Shao then besieged Luoyang's Northern Palace while his brother Yuan Shu (d.199 AD) besieged the Southern Palace. On September 25 both palaces were breached and approximately two thousand eunuchs were killed. Zhang Rang had previously fled with Emperor Shao (r.189 AD) and his brother Liu Xie—the future Emperor Xian of Han (r. 189–220 AD). While <b>being</b> <b>pursued</b> <b>by</b> the Yuan brothers, Zhang committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River.|$|E
