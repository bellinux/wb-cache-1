50|$|Species of {{game fish}} in the lake include walleye, yellow perch, and black crappies. The lake also {{supports}} populations of Northern pike, <b>black</b> <b>bullheads,</b> and common carp.

5000|$|They are omnivorous, so {{will eat}} almost anything, from grains and other plant matter to insects, dead or living fish, and crustaceans. They have short, pointed, conical teeth, formed in {{multiple}} rows called cardiform teeth. <b>Black</b> <b>bullheads</b> have no scales; instead, they have about 100,000 taste receptors placed all over their bodies. Many {{of these are}} located on the barbels near their mouths. The receptors help the fish to identify food in their dark habitats. During the winter, <b>black</b> <b>bullheads</b> decrease food intake, and may stop eating altogether. Instead, they bury themselves around the shore line of the lake in debris, with only their gills exposed. This [...] "hibernation" [...] allows them to survive conditions of low oxygen and low temperature.|$|R

50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>bullheads</b> {{start to}} spawn in April and {{continue}} through June. The females scoop {{out a small}} hole or depression in the lake floor and lay 2000 to 6000 eggs. The males fertilize the eggs, then care for them. When the eggs hatch a week later, both parents watch over the fry for a short while.|$|R
50|$|The lake is the {{location}} of a state recreation area managed by the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks which includes camping facilities. Several boat launches are also located on the lake. A popular destination for anglers, game fish in the lake include walleye, northern pike, yellow perch and sunfish. Common carp and <b>black</b> <b>bullheads</b> are also present.|$|R
40|$|Two {{pairs of}} <b>black</b> <b>bullheads,</b> Ictalurus melas (Rafinesque), were {{observed}} spawning {{out of season}} in two 90 -gal laboratory aquaria after the females had received injections of finely ground acetone-dried carp pituitaries.

50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>bullheads</b> can {{be caught}} using similar {{techniques}} as for channel or blue catfish, although their small size may require smaller bait and hooks. They respond {{very well to}} earthworms and will tend to feed higher up {{in the water column}} than channel catfish. Like most catfish, they are most active at night, and tend to be less active during the day, bedding under piers or in shady shore areas.|$|R
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>bullheads</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} the central United States, often in stagnant or slow-moving waters with soft bottoms. They {{have been known to}} congregate in confined spaces, such as lake outlets or under dams. They are very tolerant fish, and are able to live in muddy water, with warmer temperatures and in water with lower levels of oxygen, which reduce competition from other fish.Black bullheads also occur as an invasive species in large parts of Europe.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reservoir}} it creates, Lake Ashtabula, is a riverine lake oriented {{north to}} south, about 27 miles long. [...] The name [...] "Ashtabula" [...] is a Native American word meaning [...] "Fish River." [...] It has a water {{surface area of}} 5234 acres, a maximum capacity of 156,000 acre-feet; and normal storage of 69,500 acre-feet. [...] Popular for recreation, Lake Ashtabula contains walleye, northern pike, white bass, yellow perch and <b>black</b> <b>bullheads.</b> The Corps of Engineers maintains seven recreation areas around the lake.|$|R

5000|$|Considered rough fish, <b>black</b> <b>bullheads</b> are not {{as popular}} for sport fishing as their larger cousins, channel catfish, blue catfish and flat head catfish. However, they have pale flesh and make {{excellent}} table fare when water quality is good despite their small size. As with channel catfish the flesh around the bellies and gills of larger individuals can be strong tasting due to yellow fat, but these flavors can be avoided by removing the fatty portions of a large specimen when cleaning. They are {{the largest of the}} bullheads and are one of several catfish informally referred to as mud catfish.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —At {{two sites}} {{in each of}} two lakes, we sam-pled days and nights to {{evaluate}} diel and gear (pulsed-DC boat electrofisher versus large beach seine) differ-ences in species richness, total fish abundance, assem-blage similarity, and size structure of populations of bluegills Lepomis macrochirus. Both gears produced sig-nificantly greater species richness at night than during the day. Total catch per unit effort for electrofishing was significantly greater for nighttime than for daytime sam-ples. Diel differences in total density for seining samples were not statistically significant. Ordination of the elec-trofishing data tended to separate night samples from day samples at sites because of greater abundance of bluegills, <b>black</b> <b>bullheads</b> Ameiurus melas, walleyes Sti-zostedion vitreum, and white suckers Catostomus com...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{being very}} shallow, Lake Ocheda is {{well-stocked}} with several varieties of fish. <b>Black</b> <b>Bullheads</b> and Yellow <b>Bullheads</b> are abundant. <b>Black</b> Crappies and White crappies {{are also very}} common, as are orangspotted sunfish and yellow perch. The lake is stocked yearly with northern pike and yellow perch because these species can tolerate low oxygen-levels better than other game species. Ocheda Lake is a very shallow lake and it often experiences low oxygen during the winter. Complete winterkills of northern pike and yellow perch have never been documented. The northern pike population has done quite well {{for the last six}} years. Northern pike numbers have remained near average for lakes similar to Ocheda Lake. Northern pike lengths ranged from 16.5 to 30.0 inches.|$|R
