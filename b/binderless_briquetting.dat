40|$|The {{potential}} of <b>binderless</b> <b>briquetting</b> {{as a means}} of transforming low-rank coals into low moisture high grade solid fuel products has been studied. Using two dried low-rank coals, binderless briquettes with high mechanical strength have been successfully produced through mechanical compression. An increase in heating value was achieved as a result of moisture reduction in the briquettes compared to as-received coals. The residue moisture content in the briquettes had a predominant effect on briquetting characteristics and there existed an optimum moisture content for the maximum briquettes strength. The chemical structure and wettability of binderless briquettes were analyzed using FTIR and contact angle measurement. The results showed that hydrophobicity and chemical structure significantly affected the briquette properties...|$|E
40|$|Technology {{development}} of lignite upgrading involving drying and <b>binderless</b> <b>briquetting</b> {{is important to}} the efficient utilization of lignite resources. In this study, the effects of briquetting conditions, i. e., briquetting pressure, temperature, coal properties and pretreatment, on the compressive strength of briquettes were systemically investigated using a lab-scale briquetting testing rig. The experimental results indicated that the compressive strength of briquettes increased with increasing the compression pressure. An optimum strength was obtained at the briquetting temperature of 150 °C. There also existed an optimum moisture content of 14 – 16 % at which the highest compressive briquette strength was achieved. The increase in the amount of – 125 μm size fraction in the feed sample increased the briquette strength. FTIR analysis showed that the oxygen-containing functional groups have a significant influence on the compressive briquette strength due to the ability of forming more hydrogen bonds...|$|E
40|$|Pyrolysis and {{combustion}} {{characteristics of}} an Indonesian low-rank coal are studied under oxy-fuel (O₂/CO₂) and air (O₂/N₂) conditions using a {{drop tube furnace}} (DTF) and a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Raw coal, dried coal, and binderless briquette samples of the same coal {{were used in the}} experiments, and the effects of drying and <b>binderless</b> <b>briquetting</b> on the reactivity of the coal under different conditions were investigated. Chars were prepared in the DTF in both N₂ and CO₂ atmospheres in the temperature range of 800 − 1400 °C. The reactivity of chars under oxy-fuel and air conditions was analyzed in the TGA. The coal reactivity under oxy-fuel conditions differed from that under air combustion conditions. The temperature at which significant gasification of the coal and char took place in the concentrated CO₂ gas stream was also identified. Characteristics of chars from different conditions were compared. Drying and briquetting had some noticeable influences on the reactivity of the coal under oxy-fuel conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} and combustion characteristics of <b>binderless</b> palm biomass <b>briquettes</b> were investigated experimentally for various particle sizes and heating temperatures (150 - 210 ?). In this study, empty fruit bunch (EFB) fibres {{were used as}} a raw material. They were grounded and sieved into three different sizes; i) < 300 µm(small size), ii) 0. 5 mm to 1. 0 mm (medium size) and iii) 1. 0 mm to 3. 9 mm (large size). As a result, all particle sizes are possible {{to be used for}} making <b>binderless</b> <b>briquette</b> since the reliable compressive strength can be obtained. All the values of compressive strength are sufficiently high to resist mechanical disintegration. In addition, all calorific values are found to be very close to the minimum requirement for making commercial briquette, based on standard DIN 51731 (17500 kJ/kg). Meanwhile, the moisture and ash content of the briquettes produced are found to be very competitive with the values belonging to a widely used local briquette. Based on the experimental results, {{it can be said that}} the best quality of 100 % EFB briquette can be achieved when small particle size is used and the briquetting process is performed at the highest heating temperature...|$|R
40|$|Current energy {{shortage}} {{and environmental issues}} resulting {{from the use of}} fossil fuels have lead to exploitation of renewable energy resources that includes municipal waste and agricultural residues. These residues are available, indigenous and are environmental friendly but some can not be used directly in combustion process due high moisture content and low volumetric energy unless by briquetting. The study was undertaken to assess the combustion characteristic of <b>binderless</b> <b>briquettes</b> produced from waste paper and groundnut shell. Combustion characteristics investigated were ignition time, burning time, calorific values, burning rate, specific fuel consumption, fuel efficiency and water boiling time. The calorific values of the briquettes ranged from 19. 51 - 19. 92 MJ/kg, while the thermal efficiency ranges between 13. 75 – 21. 64 %, other results shows that the average burning rate between 0. 511 and 1. 133 kg/hr and the specific fuel consumption ranges between 0. 087 and 0. 131 J/g. The recorded boiling time values were between 17. 5 and 30. 0 minutes for cold start and 15. 0 and 20. 0 minutes for hot start. The results shows that waste paper and groundnut shell up to 25 % in composition composite briquettes were found to have good combustion characteristics which qualify them as alternative to firewood for domestic and industrial energy. However, production of briquettes from waste paper and groundnut shell at mixing ratio of 85 : 15 was found to comparatively better from all experiment conducted...|$|R
