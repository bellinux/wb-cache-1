50|$|In April 1946, {{a fire in}} a drying room {{destroyed}} most of {{the pottery}} plant including much of their manufacturing equipment. Vernon quickly rebuilt, but the company suffered another devastating fire in 1947. They rebuilt their manufacturing facility again, taking the opportunity to modernize. The old <b>beehive</b> <b>kilns</b> were replaced with modern tunnel kilns that dramatically increased production capacity.|$|R
5000|$|Attractions in the Pokolbin area include {{numerous}} wineries and Pokolbin village. The Hunter Valley Gardens span over 25 ha {{of land in}} {{the heart}} of the Hunter vineyards at the foot of the Brokenback Range, west of Cessnock. Potters Brewery, established in 2002, is the Hunter's first microbrewery located in the heritage listed [...] "Brick <b>Beehive</b> <b>Kilns</b> of Nulkaba". The Great North Walk, a long-distance walking trail between Sydney and Newcastle, has an extension that goes to Pokolbin.|$|R
5000|$|Port Matilda {{was home}} to McFeely Brick Co., located on Brick St. at the {{northeast}} end of the town adjacent to the railroad. The company was based at Latrobe, Pennsylvania and founded by Fred McFeely, the grandfather of children's television personality Fred Rogers. The company was later owned by General Refractories, which closed the Port Matilda plant in 1959. Its primary product was silica fire brick made from ganister rock, using <b>beehive</b> <b>kilns.</b> Its bricks were typically stamped [...] "Vulcan".|$|R

50|$|Immediately {{north of}} the main {{processing}} complex is a shallow basin formed by natural rises in ground. Within this basin lay the powerhouse and boiler house machinery beds, ore tunnel, <b>beehive</b> <b>kiln,</b> the lower condenser area and railway embankments.|$|E
50|$|In 1872, Samuel A. Weller founded Weller Pottery in Fultonham, Ohio, United States. Originally, his {{business}} {{consisted of a}} small cabin and one <b>beehive</b> <b>kiln,</b> and Weller produced flower pots, bowls, crocks, and vases. By 1905, Weller Pottery was the largest pottery in the country. It mass-produced art pottery until about 1920, and it produced commercial lines until the pottery closed in 1948.|$|E
50|$|From 1870 to 1884, the Leland Lake Superior Iron Co. {{operated}} an iron smelter {{north of}} the river mouth, supplied with ore from the Upper Peninsula and charcoal made from local maple and beech timber; the charcoal was produced in fourteen <b>beehive</b> <b>kilns</b> near the smelting furnace, which produced up to 40 tons of iron per day. In 1884, the plant was sold to the Leland Lumber Co., which operated a saw mill on the site. Other sawmills and shingle mills operated in Leland during the years 1885-1900.|$|R
50|$|Guignard Brick Works is a {{historic}} industrial site and national historic district located in Cayce, Lexington County, South Carolina. The brick works was established by the Guignard family in 1801 {{and over the years}} produced brick for many buildings in Columbia, South Carolina and throughout the South. The complex includes four brick <b>beehive</b> <b>kilns,</b> {{a historic}} brick office, and remnants of other industrial features of the brick works. Three of the four remaining kilns were built around 1920, the other was built in 1932. Clay for brickmaking was obtained from banks of the nearby Congaree River.|$|R
50|$|Horwich Vale Printworks, {{founded in}} 1799 by the River Douglas, printed cloth using {{machines}} and handblocks. On {{the slopes of}} Winter Hill, stone was quarried and there were several small collieries and a firebrick and tile works. In 1896 the Montcliffe Colliery was owned by Adam Mason and Son and managed by Joseph Crankshaw and Joseph Kenwright. It employed 26 men underground and seven surface workers getting coal and fireclay from the Mountain coal seam. Crankshaws pipeworks used the fireclay and had had several <b>beehive</b> <b>kilns</b> at their works at Tiger's Clough. In the mid 19th century cotton mills were built by W. & W. Bennett and Peter Gaskell.|$|R
50|$|The pottery was {{scheduled}} as a National Industrial Monument in 1973, {{and at the}} time was the only steam-powered pottery remaining in the United Kingdom. It was restored in 1994, with the steam equipment restored in 1995 by Fred Dibnah. The original <b>beehive</b> <b>kiln</b> is still standing, and is now a showcase for pottery that has been produced at the site over the years.|$|E
5000|$|Mount Pleasant Pipeworks [...] John Knowle's Mount Pleasant pipe-works at Woodville, Swadlincote {{was once}} a major {{employer}} in the area. It has now been demolished but before redevelopment the bases of a tunnel kiln and <b>beehive</b> <b>kiln</b> were excavated Together with detailed records {{going back to the}} 19th century and photos preserved by ex-employees it has been possible to create detailed 3D reconstructions of the plant.|$|E
50|$|In 1914, Mr. Henderson {{built an}} {{enormous}} <b>beehive</b> <b>kiln</b> 28-feet in diameter {{of his own}} design made of unmortared bricks. When it was carefully stacked {{with two or three}} freight car loads of unfired pottery, the opening was sealed and the kiln was slowly heated with 15 tons of coal and four cords of wood to a temperature of 2500- 3000 degrees Fahrenheit. After days of cooling, the door would be opened, brick by brick, and the fired pieces removed. The entire process took about one week to complete.|$|E
50|$|The Continental Clay Brick Plant in Martinsburg, West Virginia {{includes}} {{a number of}} <b>beehive</b> brick <b>kilns.</b> Originally a coal-fired brickworks, it was later converted to natural gas. The kilns are now largely disused, {{except for a few}} used to dry sand.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>beehive</b> <b>kilns</b> were down-draft kilns. In {{this case}} {{they had a}} double skin with fire holes around the {{external}} circumference and a main loading door. Counter weighted covers were used to open and close these openings. The heat would initially {{rise to the top}} of the kiln and then be forced down through the centre around the product, finally being vented below ground in tunnels to a chimney at the end of the group of kilns. The kilns were specifically designed for the production of salt glazed sewerage pipes. Their construction reflects this as the salt could be added to the fires and then distributed evenly across the product as vapour at a certain stage of firing.|$|R
5000|$|The Carolina, Clinchfield & Ohio Railroad {{constructed}} a railroad {{line through the}} mountains of northeast Tennessee in the early 1900s. In an attempt to encourage industry along this line, they sold several acres of land along what is now Ohio Avenue in Erwin to several investors {{for the establishment of}} a pottery. The kaolinite and feldspar deposits in the adjacent hills made Erwin an ideal place for the manufacture of ceramics, and the pottery plant was likely in operation by late 1916. [...] The plant initially had seven <b>beehive</b> <b>kilns</b> - [...] four for glaze and decorator firing, and three for bisque firing - [...] and was surrounded by approximately forty houses for company employees.|$|R
5000|$|The {{enterprise}} {{was provided}} with fuel (coal) via a siding from the Eden Valley railway line, when the railway closed in 1962 the pottery kiln {{fell out of}} use. The <b>beehive</b> <b>kiln</b> remains, as does a blunger for preparing suitable clay. The steam engine used to drive the pottery machinery was restored in the 1990s by Fred Dibnah. Facilities built for visitors including a museum.Pottery making was revived at Wetheriggs, as the only remaining steam-powered pottery in the country. Mary Chappelhow became the master potter at Wetheriggs in 2003: production has since ceased at the site, but she works at Brougham Hall.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{handcrafted}} pots {{continued to}} attract attention, {{they could not}} compete in the commercial market. The last firing of the big <b>beehive</b> <b>kiln</b> took place in 1965, and after that smaller gas and later electric kilns were used until the pottery works closed in 1979. Yet the diversified production of the Dorchester Pottery Works {{and the fact that}} it was a family-run operation helped it to stay open longer than other commercial New England potteries such as Bennington, Dedham and Hampshire. Some of its products were: storage jars from 5 to 75 gallons, beanpots both for restaurant and home use, cheese jars, foot-warmers, plates, platters, pitchers, pots, planters, bowls, casseroles, cuspidors, vases, flower baskets, bird baths, Toby jugs, cookie jars, steins, mugs, demitasse cups and saucers as well as special-order custom designs.|$|E
50|$|Archaeologist Dr. Timothy E. Baumann McClung Museum of Natural History and Culture, University of East Tennessee began {{conducting}} {{surveys in}} 1995 to explore African-American life and culture from the slavery period through emancipation {{and into the}} early 20th century. He has led teams in excavating several households, a schoolhouse, a church, and a Masonic Lodge {{that were part of}} Arrow Rockâ€™s African-American community. Dr. Baumann confirmed that the Masonic Lodge had been built over the site of the Caldwell Pottery Works, the third largest pottery works in Missouri during the 1850s and 1860s. Remains of a <b>beehive</b> <b>kiln,</b> outbuildings and thousands of shards of pottery and testing clay were uncovered. He continues as a museum consultant for Friends of Arrow Rock, Inc. He has also excavated slave quarters at two neighboring plantation sites, Prairie Park and Oak Grove.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{records of}} coal being {{produced}} exist from 1384, when locally worked shallow shafts produced coal for Richmond Castle. The coal found was a poor-quality crow coal, which produced a dirty, dusty fuel. But local farmers wives preferred it as, when mixed with peat, it gave a good glow, {{was easy to}} stack up over night, and easy to revive in the morning. Before {{the start of the}} Industrial Revolution, the easily accessible upper seams were mainly worked out, requiring investment in deeper shafts. By the 17th century the poor-quality coal was locally converted in simple <b>beehive</b> <b>kilns</b> into coke - known locally as [...] "cinders" [...] - which was used in lead and iron smelting.|$|R
5000|$|Early European {{surveyor}} Moses Greenleaf {{translated the}} Abnaki name Munnalammonungan {{for the west}} branch of the Pleasant River as [...] "very fine paint." [...] About 1820 he found Ore Mountain of orange, yellow, and red iron oxide pigments used for Abnaki paints. It {{was identified as a}} limonite gossan in 1843. Samuel Smith built a road from Brownville, Maine in 1841 and then built a company town where the West Branch of the Pleasant River flows out of Silver Lake. The town included the American Lumber Company sawmill, boarding house, cooperative store, town hall, school, post office, stables, and homes for 200 families. Stonemasons then built a 55-foot high rock blast furnace with water-powered blowers. They also built eighteen stone <b>beehive</b> <b>kilns</b> to convert wood to charcoal for producing about 2,000 tons of pig iron annually.|$|R
5000|$|Portland {{cement clinker}} was first made (in 1825) in a {{modified}} {{form of the}} traditional static lime kiln. [...] The basic, egg-cup shaped lime kiln was provided with a conical or beehive shaped extension to increase draught and thus obtain the higher temperature needed to make cement clinker. For nearly half a century, this design, and minor modifications, remained the only method of manufacture. The kiln was restricted in size by {{the strength of the}} chunks of rawmix: if the charge in the kiln collapsed under its own weight, the kiln would be extinguished. For this reason, <b>beehive</b> <b>kilns</b> never made more than 30 tonnes of clinker per batch. A batch took one week to turn around: a day to fill the kiln, three days to burn off, two days to cool, and a day to unload. Thus, a kiln would produce about 1500 tonnes per year.|$|R
50|$|The Moses King Brick and Tile Works is a {{historic}} brickworks located at 738 North Coal Street in Colchester, Illinois. The complex includes King's Folk Victorian home, four of the original seven <b>beehive</b> <b>kilns,</b> the factory building and its drying tunnels, two exhaust stacks, and various outbuildings. Moses King established the brickworks on his own land, which held one of the county's richest clay deposits, in 1881. The brickworks was {{a major part of}} Colchester's clay industry, which developed as a way of using excess coal from the city's more prominent coal mining industry; it eventually became one of the city's main economic drivers, along with coal and the railroad. While coal and clay both declined in Colchester in the twentieth century, the brickworks survived as a producer of buff brick, ultimately becoming the last surviving brickwors in the city. It closed in the 1960s when buff brick declined in favor of colored brick, which could be more easily obtained from other sources.|$|R
50|$|After drying, {{the bricks}} were then fired {{in one of}} the three {{circular}} down-draught kilns (also known as <b>beehive</b> or Newcastle <b>kilns),</b> made of brick with iron bands and domed roofs.|$|R
