40|$|Meeting {{radiation}} protection requirements during EVA is predominantly an operational issue with some potential considerations for temporary shelter. The issue of spacesuit shielding is mainly {{guided by the}} potential of accidental exposure when operational and temporary shelter considerations fail to maintain exposures within operational limits. In this case, very high exposure levels are possible which could result in observable health effects and even be life threatening. Under these assumptions, potential spacesuit radiation exposures have been studied using known historical solar particle events to gain insight on the usefulness of modification of spacesuit design in which the control of skin exposure is a critical design issue and reduction of <b>blood</b> <b>forming</b> <b>organ</b> exposure is desirable. Transition to a new spacesuit design including soft upper-torso and reconfigured life support hardware gives an opportunity to optimize the next generation spacesuit for reduced potential health effects during an accidental exposure...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of {{radiation}} {{risk to the}} <b>blood</b> <b>forming</b> <b>organs</b> from galactic cosmic rays are presented for manned interplanetary missions. The calculations use the Naval Research Laboratory cosmic ray spectrum model as input into the Langley Research Center galactic cosmic ray transport code. This transport code, which transports both heavy ions and nucleons, {{can be used with}} any number of layers of target material, consisting of up to five different constituents per layer. Calculated galactic cosmic ray doses and dose equivalents behind various thicknesses of aluminum and water shielding are presented for solar maximum and solar minimum periods. Estimates of risk to the <b>blood</b> <b>forming</b> <b>organs</b> are made using 5 cm depth dose/dose equivalent values for water. These results indicate that at least 5 g/sq cm (5 cm) of water of 6. 5 g/sq cm (2. 4 cm) of aluminum shield is required to reduce annual exposure below the current recommended limit of 50 rem. Because of the large uncertainties in fragmentation parameters, and the input cosmic ray spectrum, these exposure estimates may be uncertain by as much as 70 percent. Therefore, more detailed analyses with improved inputs could indicate the need for additional shielding...|$|E

40|$|In {{estimating}} the crew exposures during an EVA, {{the contribution of}} reentrant electrons has always been neglected. Although the flux of these electrons is small compared to the flux of trapped electrons, their energy spectrum extends to several GeV compared to about 7 MeV for trapped electrons. This is also true of splash electrons. Using the measured reentrant electron energy spectra, it is shown that the dose contribution of these electrons to the <b>blood</b> <b>forming</b> <b>organs</b> (BFO) is more than 10 times greater than that from the trapped electrons. The calculations also show that the dose-depth response is a very slowly changing function of depth, and thus adding reasonable amounts of additional shielding would not significantly lower the dose to BFO...|$|E

Also is the marrow rich in fat, the same cells are present but in lower quantity and their number decreases parallel to the {{decrease in the number of}} marrow cells and the increase in the number of fat cells (see above [...] "Neumann-Law"). It is possible, to trace the origin of these elements in the blood of the marrow cells The high content of colorless elements in the blood of the marrow makes it likely that these is a migration of contractile marrow cells into the vessels.

40|$|During future lunar missions, {{exposure}} to solar particle events (SPEs) {{is a major}} safety concern for crew members during extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) on the lunar surface or Earth-to-moon transit. NASA s new lunar program anticipates that up to 15 % of crew time may be on EVA, with minimal radiation shielding. For the operational challenge to respond to events of unknown size and duration, a probabilistic risk assessment approach is essential for mission planning and design. Using the historical database of proton measurements during the past 5 solar cycles, a typical hazard function for SPE occurrence was defined using a non-homogeneous Poisson model {{as a function of}} time within a non-specific future solar cycle of 4000 days duration. Distributions ranging from the 5 th to 95 th percentile of particle fluences for a specified mission period were simulated. Organ doses corresponding to particle fluences at the median and at the 95 th percentile for a specified mission period were assessed using NASA s baryon transport model, BRYNTRN. The cancer fatality risk for astronauts as functions of age, gender, and solar cycle activity were then analyzed. The probability of exceeding the NASA 30 - day limit of <b>blood</b> <b>forming</b> <b>organ</b> (BFO) dose inside a typical spacecraft was calculated.

40|$|For long {{duration}} missions {{outside of}} {{the protection of the}} Earth's magnetic field, exposure to solar particle events (SPEs) is a major safety concern for crew members during extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) on the lunar surface or Earth-to-moon or Earth-to-Mars transit. The large majority (~ 90 %) of SPEs have small or no health consequences because the doses are low and the particles do not penetrate to organ depths. However, there is an operational challenge to respond to events of unknown size and duration. We have developed a probabilistic approach to SPE risk assessment in support of mission design and operational planning. Using the historical database of proton measurements during the past 5 solar cycles, the functional form of hazard function of SPE occurrence per cycle was found for nonhomogeneous Poisson model. A typical hazard function was defined as a function of time within a non-specific future solar cycle of 4000 days duration. Distributions of particle fluences for a specified mission period were simulated ranging from its 5 th to 95 th percentile. Organ doses from large SPEs were assessed using NASA's Baryon transport model, BRYNTRN. The SPE risk was analyzed with the organ dose distribution for the given particle fluences during a mission period. In addition to the total particle fluences of SPEs, the detailed energy spectra of protons, especially at high energy levels, were recognized as extremely important for assessing the cancer risk associated with energetic particles for large events. The probability of exceeding the NASA 30 -day limit of <b>blood</b> <b>forming</b> <b>organ</b> (BFO) dose inside a typical spacecraft was calculated for various SPE sizes. This probabilistic approach to SPE protection will be combined with a probabilistic approach to the radiobiological factors that contribute to the uncertainties in projecting cancer risks in future work...|$|R

40|$|The radioprotective {{activity}} {{of a number}} of biological amines, amongst them histamine and epinephrine, {{has been shown to be}} related to their pharmacological activity in mice. Pharmacological antagonists were found to counteract the protective {{activity of}} these compounds. The protective effect could not be correlated with the effects of the amines on the blood pressure. By the use of a polarographic technique it could be shown that the protective compounds cause a decrease of the oxygen tension in the spleen, the magnitude and duration of which is correlated to the degree of radioprotection. Similarly a reduction of the oxygen content of the inspiratory air reduces the oxygen tension in the spleen and affords protection against irradiation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) {{has a high}} preva-lence in Serbian population, {{estimated}} to cause more than 50 % of deaths. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) considerably influence efficacy and safety of therapy, and result in increased morbidity and mortality. The aim {{was to assess the}} prevalence of clinically significant DDIs and identify the most common interacting drugs. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was carried out in the Cardiology ward of Medical Center Bezanijska Kosa, Bel-grade. Data for 100 patients aged ≥ 65 years with diagnosed CVD and prescribed ≥ 2 drugs during hospitalization, were collected from medical charts. DDIs were evaluated using Lexicomp data-base. Data were analyzed using MSOffice Excel 2010. RESULTS: A total of 877 prescriptions were recorded; the mean number of drugs per patient were 8. 77 (2 – 14). Seventy interacting drugs contributed to 1269 clinically significant DDIs (risk rating C: monitor therapy 1156; D: consider therapy modification 106; X: avoid combination 7). Three patients received combination of amiodarone and ciprofloxacin, three clopidogrel and omeprazole, and one amiodarone and fluoxetine.

40|$|Radiation {{protection}} practices {{define the}} effective dose as a weighted sum of equivalent dose over major organ sites for radiation cancer risks. Since a crew personnel dosimeter {{does not make}} direct measurement of the effective dose, {{it has been estimated}} with skin-dose measurements and radiation transport codes for ISS and STS missions. If sufficient protection is not provided near solar maximum, the radiation risk can be significant due to exposure to sporadic solar particle events (SPEs) {{as well as to the}} continuous galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on future exploratory-class and long-duration missions. For accurate estimates of overall fatal cancer risks from SPEs, the specific doses at various <b>blood</b> <b>forming</b> <b>organs</b> (BFOs) were considered, because proton fluences and doses vary considerably across marrow regions.
