The microbes were strains from hospital environments. Copper and its nickel-silver, cupronickel, and brass alloys {{were found to}} kill the bacteria within a short time. In another experiment, bacterial colonies were investigated on <b>ball</b> <b>point</b> pens made with and without copper alloys. Total bacterial colonies on the copper pens were much lower than on the non-copper pens: 2.1 CFU versus 47.8 CFU. Staphyloccocus counts on copper <b>ball</b> <b>point</b> pens were also much lower: 0.7 CFUs versus 20.8 CFUs on non-copper pens.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} using a <b>ball</b> <b>point</b> within a writing {{instrument}} {{as a method of}} applying ink to paper has existed since the late 19th century. In these inventions, the ink was placed in a thin tube whose end was blocked by a tiny ball, held so that it could not slip into the tube or fall out of the pen.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of these components {{can be compared}} with the ball-applicator of roll-on antiperspirant; the same technology at a larger scale. The <b>ball</b> <b>point</b> tip delivers the ink to the writing surface while acting as a buffer between the ink in the reservoir and the air outside, preventing the quick-drying ink from drying inside the reservoir. Modern ballpoints are said to have a two-year shelf life, on average.|$|E

5000|$|Balling, or scoring, in a thunee game is won by {{the player}} or team who has won 12 rounds, or <b>ball</b> <b>points.</b> 13 rounds or <b>ball</b> <b>points</b> must be reached to win if a khanuck was called during the game. A common variant {{requires}} 13 rounds to win a game regardless if khanuck was called or not. A thunee or khanuck game may be played during any stage of the game, however a double game may not be played when a teams ball score is on cornerhouse (last remaining point to win). If a team calls a cornerhouse double, the opposition is awarded a penalty, gaining 4 balls. Certain variants of the game require a team to win by a minimum of 2 points, {{a process known as}} [...] "2 to clear", however other variants maintain that this play is only applicable when a kanuck is called during the game.|$|R

40|$|I {{confirm that}} this is my own work {{and the use of}} all {{material}} from other sources has been properly and fully acknowledged. Let I and J be norm closed inner ideals of a JB*-triple. The main theorem of the thesis states that I and J are equal precisely when ∂e(I ∗ 1) = ∂e(J ∗ 1). Moreover, we prove that I ⊂ J exactly when ∂e(I ∗ 1) ⊂ ∂e(J ∗ 1). Thus, JB*triple inner ideals are determined by extreme dual <b>ball</b> <b>points.</b> The tool used to reach this conclusion is what we term the Inner Stone-Weierstrass Theorem for JB*-triples; we show that for norm closed inner ideals I and J of a JB*-triple, where I ⊂ J, we may conclude that I = J if ∂e(I ∗ 1) = ∂e(J ∗ 1). Our excuse for this terminology is that the equality of the extreme dual <b>ball</b> <b>points</b> implies a Stone-Weierstrass separation condition, that is, that I separates ∂e(J ∗ 1) ∪ { 0 }. To create this tool, we first exploit structure space techniques to make a reduction to JC*-triples. Progressing further, we employ the Zelmanovia...|$|R
