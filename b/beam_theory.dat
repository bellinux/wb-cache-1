It covers the case for small deflections of a beam that are subjected to lateral loads only. It is thus a special case of Timoshenko <b>beam</b> <b>theory.</b> It was first enunciated circa 1750, but was not applied {{on a large scale}} until the development of the Eiffel Tower and the Ferris wheel in the late 19th century.

In the coordinate free and metric independent geometric formulation of continuum mechanics {{as well as}} for <b>beam</b> <b>theories,</b> the principle of virtual work serves as the fundamental principle of mechanics. Based on the perception of analytical mechanics that forces of a mechanical system are defined as dual quantities to the kinematical description, the virtual work approach is a systematic way to treat arbitrary mechanical systems. Whereas this methodology is very convenient to formulate induced <b>beam</b> <b>theories,</b> it is essential in geometric continuum mechanics when the assumptions on the physical space are relaxed and the space is modeled as a smooth manifold. The book addresses researcher and graduate students in engineering and mathematics interested in recent developments of a geometric formulation of continuum mechanics and a hierarchical development of induced <b>beam</b> <b>theories...</b>|$|R

The free vibration and axial buckling of SWCNTs are discussed as subset problems. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the influences of the static load factor, temperature change, nonlocal elastic parameter, slenderness ratio and spring constant of the elastic medium on the dynamic stability characteristics of the SWCNTs, with simply-supported boundary conditions. It is found that the difference between instability regions predicted by local and nonlocal <b>beam</b> <b>theories</b> is significant for nanotubes with lower aspect ratios. Moreover, it is observed that in contrast to high temperature environments, at low temperatures, increasing the temperature change moves the origins of the instability regions to higher excitation frequencies and leads to further stability of the system at lower excitation frequencies...|$|R

The order of the beam elements can vary in different sub-domains. This subdivision has been called "multi-line" as opposed to the "one-line" approach of classical <b>beam</b> <b>theories.</b> 1 D compatibility conditions of the displacements at selected points of the sub-domain interface boundaries are imposed by using Lagrange multipliers.

40|$|Buckling {{analysis}} of functionally graded micro beams based on modified couple stress theory is presented. Three different <b>beam</b> <b>theories,</b> i. e. classical, {{first and third}} order shear deformation <b>beam</b> <b>theories,</b> are considered to study the effect of shear deformations. To present a profound insight {{on the effect of}} boundary conditions, beams with hinged-hinged, clamped–clamped and clamped–hinged ends are studied. Governing equations and boundary conditions are derived using principle of minimum potential energy. Afterwards, generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) method is applied to solve the obtained differential equations. Some numerical results are presented to study the effects of material length scale parameter, beam thickness, Poisson ratio and power index of material distribution on size dependent buckling load. It is observed that buckling loads predicted by modified couple stress theory deviates significantly from classical ones, especially for thin beams. It is shown that size dependency of FG micro beams differs from isotropic homogeneous micro beams as it is a function of power index of material distribution. In addition, the general trend of buckling load with respect to Poisson ratio predicted by the present model differs from classical one. status: publishe...|$|R
