40|$|INTRODUCTION: The shear bond {{strength}} of orthodontic brackets bonded to micro-hybrid and micro-particulate resins under different surface treatment methods was assessed. METHODS: Two {{hundred and eighty}} test samples were divided into 28 groups (n = 10), where 140 specimens were filled with Durafill micro-particulate resin and 140 with Charisma composite. In 140 samples, a coupling agent (silane) was applied. The surface treatment methods were: Phosphoric and hydrofluoric acid etching, sodium bicarbonate and aluminum oxide <b>blasting,</b> <b>stone</b> and burs. A Universal Instron Machine was used to apply an occlusal shear force directly to the resin composite bracket surface at a speed of 0. 5 mm/min. The means were compared using analysis of variance and multivariate regression to assess the interaction between composites and surface treatment methods. RESULTS: Means {{and standard deviations for}} the groups were: Sodium bicarbonate jet 11. 27 ± 2. 78; burs 9. 26 ± 3. 01; stone 7. 95 ± 3. 67; aluminum oxide blasting 7. 04 ± 3. 21; phosphoric acid 5. 82 ± 1. 90; hydrofluoric acid 4. 54 ± 2. 87, and without treatment 2. 75 ± 1. 49. An increase of 1. 94 MPa in shear {{bond strength}} was seen in Charisma groups. Silane agent application reduced the Charisma shear bond strength by 0. 68 Mpa, but increased Durafill means for bicarbonate blasting (0. 83), burs (0. 98) and stone drilling (0. 46). CONCLUSION: The sodium bicarbonate <b>blasting,</b> burs and <b>stone</b> drilling methods produced adequate shear bond strength and may be suitable for clinical use.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the shapes of stones and other {{particles}} formed by water or wind has always {{attracted the attention of}} geologists and mathematicians. A classical model of abrasion due to W. J. Firey leads to a geometric partial differential equation representing the continuum limit of the process. This model predicts convergence to spheres from an arbitrary initial form; analogously, the two-dimensional version of the model predicts convergence to circles. The shapes of real stones are, however, not always round. Most notably, coastal pebbles tend to be smooth but somewhat flat, and ventifacts (e. g. pyramidal dreikanters) often have completely different shapes with sharp edges. Inspired by Firey’s results, a new PDE is derived in this paper, which not only appears to be a natural mathematical generalization of the PDE, but also represents the continuum limit of a generalised abrasion model based on recurrent loss of material due to collisions of nearby pebbles. Preliminary results suggest that our model is capable to predict a broad range of limit shapes: polygonal shapes with sharp edges develop due to sand <b>blasting</b> (big <b>stone</b> surrounded by infinitesimally small particles), round stones emerge due to collisions with relatively big stones, and flat shapes are the typical outcome in the intermediate case. The results show nice agreement with real data despite the model's simplicity...|$|R

40|$|The NIOSH Office of Mine Safety and Health has {{released}} communication products about flyrock {{safety in the}} form of informational brochures, flashcards, and toolbox talk materials. Both the mining and construction industries are targeted with these helpful communication tools. These new products can be used as refresher training for employees and as introductory safety materials for onsite visitors. Background Every blast is associated with the fragmentation, and sometimes the projection, of rocks. Flyrock and blast area security dominate blasting-related accidents in surface mining. From 1978 to 2004, 311 people were killed or injured by flyrock at surface mining operations. Poor blast area security was often to blame. Flyrock is any debris that lands outside the designated blasting area. It can vary in mass from marble-sized to car-sized and can be incredibly dangerous and potentially fatal. Flyrock can be the result of an overloaded blast hole, the presence of underground voids, insufficient burden, or an inadequately sized blast area. Proper planning by the blaster is necessary prior to a blast to prevent or minimize the occurrence of flyrock. Forty percent of blasting injuries and fatalities in mining occur when people are within the blast area. Since blasted material is expected to fall within the blast area, good blast area security is essential {{to ensure the safety of}} site personnel. Figure 1 illustrates the importance of securing the blast area. Prior to a blast at a surface limestone mine, an equipment operator used his pickup truck to guard a road leading to the blast site. During the <b>blast,</b> a <b>stone</b> was projected through the truck's windshield, killing him. Preblast planning is essential for determining blast area security since each plan has to be site-specific. Following a blast, the blaster should walk the blast area to determine if the designated area was large enough and to see if changes should be made to the next shot to improve site safety. The products described here were developed for use in short safety training sessions such as start-ofshift safety talks at the worksite. The information can be presented in 15 -minute segments. The training can be tailored to any work setting by substituting appropriate examples and by discussing the individual teaching points in relation to the worksite.

The teeth were randomly assigned to 5 groups (n= 10), as follows. In group I (control), the bonded brackets remained attached until shear testing (i. e., no debonding/rebonding). In groups II, III and IV, the bonded brackets were detached and rebonded after recycling by 90 -mum particle aluminum oxide <b>blasting,</b> silicon carbide <b>stone</b> grinding or an industrial process at a specialized contractor company (Abzil-Lancer, Brazil), respectively. In group V, the bonded brackets were removed and new brackets were bonded to the enamel surface. Shear bond strength was tested in an Instron machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test at 5 % significance level. There was no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) between the control brackets (0. 52 kgf/mm²), brackets recycled by aluminum oxide blasting (0. 34 kgf/mm²) and new brackets attached to previously bonded teeth (0. 43 kgf/mm²). Brackets recycled by the specialized company (0. 28 kgf/mm²) and those recycled by silicon carbide stone grinding (0. 14 kgf/mm²) showed the lowest shear strength means and differed statistically from control brackets (0. 52 kgf/mm²) (p< 0. 05). In conclusion, the outcomes of this study showed that bracket recycling using 90 -µm aluminum oxide particle air-abrasion was efficient and technically simple, and might provide cost reduction for orthodontists and patients alike...|$|R
50|$|Summary {{from the}} Historic American Buildings Survey:When John Kennedy built this mansion in 1852, {{it was the}} focal point of Port Kennedy Village. A fine example of the Italian Villa Style, it retains many of its {{exterior}} and interior features. The first floor rooms, large and well-proportioned, still possess their elegant details and the door and window enframements, which narrow, reflect the Egyptian Revival Style. The elaborate plaster ceiling decorations in the principal rooms are superb. They represent the ultimate in craftsmanship in a now almost lost art. Surrounding the main block of the house is a graceful porch with a concave roof supported by cast-iron trellises in a grapevine-and-morning-glory design. A balcony ornaments the second-floor facade of the tower.The mansion sits on a knoll, which originally overlooked the community {{and is one of the}} few structures to survive the decline of the lime and blast furnaces in the area.John Kennedy was born in 1815, the youngest of Alexander Kennedy's eight children. In 1842 he purchased the lime works at Port Kennedy, and built one of the extensive lime productions in the area. The lime industry and Kennedy flourished during Kennedy's lifetime. The village also included a three-story hotel, a <b>blast</b> furnace with <b>stone</b> house and workshops, a Reading Railroad station, and the Presbyterian Church, a handsome stone structure built in 1845.John Kennedy died in 1877. His widow remained in the house until her death. Six owners followed. Additions were made to the house ca. 1920, and about 1950. The structure was remodeled into apartments. The National Park Service acquired the property in 1978. The Kennedy Mansion is located in Valley Forge National Historical Park.|$|R
