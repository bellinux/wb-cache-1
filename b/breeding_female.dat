5|$|The white-winged fairywren is {{primarily}} insectivorous; its diet includes small beetles, bugs, moths, praying mantises, caterpillars, and smaller insects, including spiders. The larger insects are typically fed to nestlings by the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> and her helpers, including the breeding male. Adults and juveniles forage by hopping along the shrubland floor, and may supplement their diets with seeds and fruits of saltbush (Rhagodia), goosefoot (Chenopodium) and new shoots of samphire. During spring and summer, birds {{are active in}} bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during {{the heat of the}} day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.|$|E
5|$|White-winged fairywrens live {{in complex}} social groups. Clans consist of 2–4 birds, {{typically}} one brown or partially blue male and a <b>breeding</b> <b>female.</b> Nest helpers are birds raised {{in previous years}} which remain with the family group after fledging and assist in raising young; they may be male that have retained their brown plumage, or female. Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover and engage in mutual preening. Several subgroups live within one territory and make up a clan, which is presided over by one blue (or black) male who assumes breeding plumage. While the blue male is dominant {{to the rest of}} the brown and partially blue males within his clan, he nests with only one female and contributes to the raising of only her young. It is unclear whether or not he fathers young in any of the other nests within his territory.|$|E
25|$|Once {{done with}} the brood the male, if still within the {{breeding}} season, will seek out another female and initiate the cycle again. Studies have shown that 54–62% of <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> spotted nothura are first-year birds.|$|E
50|$|Caribou have {{developed}} adaptions for optimal metabolic efficiency during warm months {{as well as}} for during cold months. The body composition of caribou varies highly with the seasons. Of particular interest is the body composition and diet of <b>breeding</b> and non-breeding <b>females</b> between seasons. <b>Breeding</b> <b>females</b> have more body mass than non-breeding females between the months of March and September with a difference of around 10 kg more than non-breeding females. From November to December, non-breeding females have more body mass than <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> as non-breeding females were able to focus their energies towards storage during colder months rather than lactation and reproduction. Body masses of both <b>breeding</b> and non-breeding <b>females</b> peaked in September. During the months of March through April, <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> have more fat mass than the nonbreeding females with a difference of almost 3 kg. After this however, nonbreeding females on average have a higher fat mass than the <b>breeding</b> <b>females.</b>|$|R

25|$|Another {{way to look}} at {{punishment}} in cotton-top tamarins is by observing their aggressive behavioral responses within and between groups, as well as between species. The cotton-top tamarin, like many marmosets, other tamarins, and specifically those in the genus Saguinus, stages aggressive displays almost exclusively towards fellow monkeys that belong to the same gender. These intrasexual displays of aggression are more frequent in females, and are vital when a <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> is forcing both subadult and adult females to emigrate out of a familial group.|$|E
25|$|DNA barcoding {{is based}} on a {{relatively}} simple concept. All eukaryote cells contain mitochondria, and animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a relatively fast mutation rate, resulting in the generation of diversity within and between populations over relatively short evolutionary timescales (thousands of generations). Typically, in animals, a single mtDNA genome is transmitted to offspring by each <b>breeding</b> <b>female,</b> and the genetic effective population size is proportional to the number of breeding females. This contrasts with the nuclear genome, which is around 100 000 times larger, where males and females each contribute two full genomes to the gene pool and effective size is therefore proportional to twice the total population size. This reduction in effective population size leads to more rapid sorting of mtDNA gene lineages within and among populations through time, due to variance in fecundity among individuals (the principle of coalescence). The combined effect of higher mutation rates and more rapid sorting of variation usually results in divergence of mtDNA sequences among species and a comparatively small variance within species. A 658-bp region (the Folmer region) of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI or COX1) gene was proposed as a potential 'barcode'.|$|E

500|$|Breeding females {{begin to}} build their nests {{in the spring and}} {{construct}} domed structures composed of spider webs, fine grasses, thistle-down, and vegetable-down, typically [...] tall and [...] thick. Each nest has a small entrance on one side and they are normally placed in thick shrubs close to the ground. A clutch of 3–4eggs is generally laid anywhere from September to January, with incubation lasting around 14days. The white-winged fairywren generally breeds in the spring in the southwest of Western Australia, but is more opportunistic in arid regions of central and northern Australia, with breeding recorded almost any month after a period of rainfall. Incubation is by the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> alone, while the breeding male (a brown or blue male) and nest helpers aid in feeding the nestlings and removing their fecal sacs. The newly hatched nestlings are altricial, gaping immediately for food, and developing downy feather tracts and opening their eyes by the third or fourth day. Nestlings remain in the nest for 10–11days, and fledglings continue to be fed for 3–4weeks following their departure from the nest. Fledglings then either stay on to help raise the next brood or move to a nearby territory. It is not unusual for a pair bond to hatch and raise two broods in one breeding season, and helpers tend to lessen the stress on the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> rather than increase the overall number of feedings. Like other fairywrens, the white-winged fairywren is particularly prone to parasitic nesting by the Horsfield's bronze cuckoo (Chalcites basalis). Parasitism by the shining bronze cuckoo (C. lucidus) and black-eared cuckoo (C. osculans) is rarely recorded.|$|E
500|$|The species' {{low rate}} of {{reproduction}} and long period of immaturity render it vulnerable to rapid change in the environment as response and recovery are slow. Their habit of forming flocks predisposes them to outbreaks of disease and localised adverse weather events.

2500|$|An {{explanation}} for why polygynous systems persist is explained by the polygyny threshold model. [...] This model demonstrates the link between female reproductive success and territory quality or {{the quality of a}} breeding situation. The polygyny threshold model also shows the effects of female reproductive success when multiple females in the same territory mate with one male. In this situation, the female has the option of breeding with an unmated male in a poor-quality territory or with an already-mated male in a high-quality territory. [...] The second <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> will receive fewer resources from the male than the first <b>breeding</b> <b>female.</b> However, if the bigamous threshold is higher than the second female's original resource threshold, the female will enter into a polygynous mating system, since she would still benefit from acquiring more resources. [...] The polygyny threshold model can be applied to more than two females, provided there are enough resources to support them.|$|E
2500|$|... 95% of {{the nests}} {{found in a}} study in New South Wales were in stringybarks, {{particularly}} the species Eucalyptus macrorhycha. The nests were almost always located high in the tree. Nest construction took around 7 days, but lining and decorating the nest added {{a few days to}} this. Nest building duties were shared amongst the group, and the speed of construction depended on how many birds were involved. Nests are usually placed in the prong of two branches, and is a deep cup decorated in the bark of the tree it is built in, thereby camouflaging it. Around 2–3 eggs are laid and incubated by the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> (or females if two are sharing the nest) for 19–20 days. Whilst incubating the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> is fed by the breeding male and helpers. After hatching the female broods the young for a few days, and for up to two weeks at night. The chicks are fed for 19–20 days in the nest. After fledging the chicks have a protracted period of parental care lasting up to 80 days, although 60 days is more usual.|$|E
2500|$|In India, {{the mating}} season occurs between mid-October and January, while captive dholes in the Moscow Zoo breed mostly in February. Unlike wolf packs, dhole clans may contain {{more than one}} <b>breeding</b> <b>female.</b> More than one female dhole may den and rear their litters {{together}} in the same den. During mating, the female assumes a crouched, cat-like position. There is no copulatory tie characteristic of other canids when the male dismounts. Instead, the pair lie on their sides facing each other in a semicircular formation. The gestation period lasts 60–63 days, with litter sizes averaging 4–6 pups. Their growth rate is much faster than that of wolves, being similar in rate to that of coyotes. Pups are suckled at least 58 days. During this time, the pack feeds the mother at the den site. Dholes do not use [...] sites to meet their pups as wolves do, though one or more adults will stay with the pups at the den {{while the rest of the}} pack hunts. Once weaning begins, the adults of the clan will regurgitate food for the pups until they are old enough to join in hunting. They remain at the den site 70–80 days. By the age of six months, pups accompany the adults on hunts, and will assist in killing large prey such as sambar by the age of eight months. Maximum longevity in captivity is 15–16 years.|$|E
50|$|The {{sex ratio}} within groups is {{significantly}} male biased, whilst dispersal is significantly female biased. No sex bias has been detected within nestlings or juveniles. It {{is probable that}} females suffer higher mortality rates due to either {{the risks associated with}} dispersal or the physiological cost of <b>breeding.</b> <b>Breeding</b> <b>females</b> also provide less food to young than do breeding males and helpers, and they reduce their provisioning rates in the presence of additional helpers. This suggests that <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> seek to conserve resources for future reproduction.|$|R
40|$|Classical {{approaches}} for the analyses of density dependence {{assume that all}} the individuals in a population equally respond and equally contribute to density dependence. However, in age-structured populations, individuals of different ages may differ in their responses to changes in population size and how they contribute to density dependence affecting {{the growth rate of}} the whole population. Here, we apply the concept of critical age classes, i. e., a specific scalar function that describes how one or a combination of several age classes affect the demographic rates negatively, in order to examine how total density dependence acting on the population growth rate depends on the age-specific population sizes. In a 38 -year dataset of an age-structured great tit (Parus major) population, we find that the age classes including the youngest <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> were the critical age classes for density regulation. These age classes correspond to new breeders that attempt to take a territory and that have the strongest competitive effect on other <b>breeding</b> <b>females.</b> They strongly affected population growth rate and reduced recruitment and survival rates of all <b>breeding</b> <b>females.</b> We also show that depending on their age class, females may differently respond to varying density. In particular, the negative effect of the number of <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> was stronger on recruitment rate of the youngest <b>breeding</b> <b>females.</b> These findings question the classical assumptions that all the individuals of a population can be treated as having an equal contribution to density regulation and that the effect of the number of individuals is age independent.

40|$|Grooming is {{the most}} common form of affiliative {{behavior}} in primates that apart from hygienic and hedonistic benefits offers important social benefits for the performing individuals. This study examined grooming behavior in a cooperatively breeding primate species, characterized by single <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> per group, polyandrous matings, dizygotic twinning, delayed offspring dispersal, and intensive helping behavior. In this system, <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> profit from the presence of helpers but also helpers profit from staying in a group and assisting in infant care due to the accumulation of direct and indirect fitness benefits. We examined grooming relationships of <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with three classes of partners (breeding males, potentially breeding males, (sub) adult non-breeding offspring) during three reproductive phases (post-partum ovarian inactivity, ovarian activity, pregnancy) in two groups of wild moustached tamarins (Saguinus mystax). We investigated whether grooming can be used to regulate group size by either ‘‘pay-for-help’’ or ‘‘pay-to-stay’’ mechanisms. Grooming of <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with <b>breeding</b> males and nonbreeding offspring was more intense and more balanced than with potentially breeding males, and most grooming occurred during the breeding females’ pregnancies. Grooming was skewed toward more investment by the <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with <b>breeding</b> males during the phases of ovarian activity, and with potentially breeding males during pregnancies.
