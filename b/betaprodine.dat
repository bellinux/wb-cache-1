5000|$|There are two isomers of the trans form of prodine, {{alphaprodine}} and <b>betaprodine.</b> Both exhibit {{optical isomerism}} and alphaprodine and <b>betaprodine</b> are racemates. [...] Alphaprodine {{was reported to}} closely related to desomorphine in steric configuration The cis form also has active isomers but not used in medicine [...] <b>Betaprodine</b> is some 5x more potent than alphaprodine, but is metabolised more rapidly, and only alphaprodine was developed for medicinal use. It has similar activity to pethidine, but with a faster onset of action and shorter duration. [...] <b>Betaprodine</b> produced more euphoria and side effects than alphaprodine at all dose levels and {{it was found that}} 5 to 10 mg of <b>betaprodine</b> equals 25 to 40 mg of alphaprodine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Betaprodine</b> (Î²-1,3-dimethyl-4-phenyl-4-piperidinol propionate) ...|$|E
50|$|Alphaprodine has a DEA ACSCN of 9010 and 2013 {{manufacturing}} {{quota of}} 3 grammes; <b>betaprodine</b> has an ACSCN of 9611 and a 2 gramme quota.|$|E
5000|$|Tests in rats showed {{alphaprodine}} to be 97 {{per cent}} {{the strength of}} morphine via the subcutaneous route and 140 per cent the strength of methadone orally. [...] <b>Betaprodine</b> was 550 per cent as strong as morphine SC, and the laevorotary cis isomer was 350 per cent as strong, and the dextrorotary cis isomer was 790 per cent was strong. [...] <b>Betaprodine</b> by mouth was 420 per cent as strong as methadone, and the cis form was 390 per cent for the laevo and 505 per cent for the dextro isomers.|$|E
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the hydrobromide of dl-betaprodine (beta dl- 1, 3 -dimethyl- 4 -phenyl- 4 -propionoxypiperidine has been determined by the heavy-atom method from three-dimensional intensity data collected with a scintillation-counter diffractometer. The structure has been refined by three cycles of differential syntheses to an R-factor of 0 - 10, and the hydrogen atoms of the molecule of <b>betaprodine</b> have been located from a three-dimensional difference synthesis. In the <b>betaprodine</b> molecule the piperidine ring has the chair form with the phenyl ring quatorial and the propionoxy chain axial as in the alpha isomerm, but the methyl group of C(3) now is axial, instead of equatorial, and is cis to the phenyl ring on C(4).)
