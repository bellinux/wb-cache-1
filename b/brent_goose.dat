25|$|The {{realm of}} birds is {{particularly}} plentiful. Amrum counts {{among the most}} important hatching areas for seabirds in Germany. It is the only remaining hatching area for the Eurasian curlew in the Wadden Sea, and the main hatching region for the common eider, but also oystercatchers, shelducks, Arctic terns, seagulls like herring gulls, common gull and the lesser black-backed gull as well as many other species use to hatch there on the beach, in between the dunes or at the mud flats. Since the dunes of Amrum are a protected nature reserve, they are the only dunes along the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein where sea gulls and ducks are breeding. In other dune areas of the North Sea coast these birds are usually scared off by tourists. Additionally vast swarms of migratory birds will rest on Amrum during the season, e.g. red knot, <b>brent</b> <b>goose</b> or sanderling, all of whom are able to find sufficient food along the coasts of Amrum. Moreover, a number of songbirds can be found and pheasants which were equally introduced as game are common.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of {{research}} on migrating bird species. Two model species for migrating birds are the Barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) and the <b>Brent</b> <b>geese</b> (Branta bernicla). A lot is known about their foraging, migrating and breeding behavior. Most studies focused only on a specific interaction during a specific time of the year. By putting all this information of different interactions and different areas together it is possible to make an interaction network for the whole flyway route of the <b>geese.</b> <b>Brent</b> <b>geese</b> are declining in numbers, while Barnacle geese numbers are growing. Because habitats are overlapping, it could be that, due to competition, the Barnacle geese have a share in the decline of the <b>Brent</b> <b>geese.</b> By comparing the interaction network of Barnacle and <b>Brent</b> <b>geese</b> it is possible to gain an insight into interactions between the two species. The analysis of the flyway route of the Barnacle geese shows that they only share the Wadden Sea wintering area with the <b>Brent</b> <b>geese.</b> It could be possible that the Barnacle geese, which are bigger and in increasing numbers, are “pushing” the <b>Brent</b> <b>geese</b> from their foraging areas. However, the <b>Brent</b> <b>geese</b> were already declining before the Barnacle arrived in the Wadden Sea area. At the moment it seems that the increasing Barnacle geese numbers do not have a direct effect on the numbers of <b>Brent</b> <b>geese.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study will}} look at the {{interaction}} between <b>brent</b> <b>geese</b> and Zostera noltii and the effect it has on the spatial mosaic of the intertidal mudflat at Uithuizerwad (The Netherlands). The spatial structure at Uithuizerwad consist of a mosaic of hummocks and hollows, which are covered with Z. noltii. In the winter this seagrass is grazed by wintering <b>brent</b> <b>geese.</b> This paper shows that <b>brent</b> <b>geese</b> spent more time in the hollows than on the hummocks and that geese grazing affects the spatial mosaic of hummocks and hollows. The geese remove excess sediment (due to over-engineering by Z. noltii) from the top of hummocks and under geese grazing the spatial mosaic of hummocks and hollows is disappearing. More research needs to be done however to fully understand the underlying processes and to test whether or not the spatial mosaic disappears for good, or that it reappears in the next growing season. ...|$|R

40|$|According to {{classical}} exploitation theory, {{the increase in}} primary productivity found over the successional gradient of the salt marsh of Schiermonnikoog should result in an increased grazing pressure. However field data obtained from the salt marsh showed the highest <b>Brent</b> <b>geese</b> grazing pressure at salt marsh areas with low primary productivity. The grazing pressure was relatively low in the more productive parts later in succession, We hypothesized {{that this could be}} due to plant species replacement along the successional gradient, with, in the course of succession, abundance of by the geese less preferred species. Therefore this study examined the relations between <b>Brent</b> <b>geese</b> and their food stock along the successional gradient with two major questions in mind. First, is there a correlation between observed grazing pressure distribution and abundance of by <b>Brent</b> <b>geese</b> preferred food plants? Second, can we explain <b>Brent</b> <b>geese</b> preference for plant species by means of aqualitative analysis of plant material? In order to answer the first question we investigated the diet of <b>Brent</b> <b>geese</b> at three different successional stages and their preference for plant species at these areas. We determined the availability of preferred and disfavoured plant species at the successional stages of different age and compared this with the observed grazing pressure distribution. Our data show that grazing pressure and abundance of preferred species are correlated, The relative abundance of preferred species is highest in the youngest areas. Brents are, in the course of succession, faced with vegetation composed of an increasing amount of disfavoured plant species. Diets however, changed only marginally, incorporating only I 5 % disfavoured species in the oldest successional stage. An answer to the second question was sought by determining energy intake, soluble carbohydrates, crude protein, fibre, ash and in vitro digestibility of most plant species present at the salt marsh and comparing these with the observed preference. Three clearly defined plant species clusters were found. One cluster was formed by the monocots, Festuca rubra, PuccineIIia maritina, Juncus gerardi and Elymus sp which were all high in soluble carbohydrates and fibres. Triglochin maritina, in which the concentration protein was highest, formed a second cluster, and a third was composed of the dicots Plantago maritima, Spergularia maritina and Aster tripolium, highest in ash content. The percentages of carbohydrates of neutral preferred species was significantly higher than the carbohydrate content of disfavoured species, There was also a tendency that preferred plants were more easy to digest. We can conclude that the observed grazing pressure distribution correlates positively with the relative abundance of preferred forage. Data, however, indicate {{that it is difficult to}} link the observed food preference to one of the analysed food quality aspects. Future studies will have to provide more insight in the feeding strategies of <b>Brent</b> <b>geese.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Brent</b> <b>geese</b> (Branta b. bernicla) and Barnacle geese (Branta !eucopsis) on Schiermonnikoog forage on {{the grass}} {{pastures}} during the winter and switch during early spring to the saltmarsh. In this study we investigated whether this habitat preference {{can be explained by}} daily energy expenditure. To estimate the daily energy expenditure, measurements of time-activity-budgets of the <b>Brent</b> <b>geese</b> in the polder area and on different vegetation types on the saltmarsh were conducted during spring 1999. Time-activity-budgets can be translated into caloric terms by measuring the average heart rate for specific behaviour. External heart rate loggers were applied on semi-captive <b>Brent</b> and Barnacle <b>geese</b> walking freely in an enclosure. The resting heart rate was calibrated against oxygen consumption in the laboratory to express the heart rate as caloric costs. Different behavioural parameters could be related to distinct heart rate ranges. Resting had the lowest heart rate, walking had a higher heart rate than foraging. The energetic costs of different behavioural parameters (as assessed by heart rate telemetry) are extrapolated to time-activity budgets of wild <b>Brent</b> <b>geese.</b> When flight is excluded the energy expenditure is lower on the polder than on the saltmarsh. However, flying is very costly, mainly due to disturbance. This results in a higher energy expenditure on the polder than on the saltmarsh., which could {{play a role in the}} observed habitat preference for the saltmarsh area as soon as food becomes available there. ...|$|R
