40|$|Branched poly(ethylene glycols) (PEG 2) are {{nowadays}} {{widely used}} for protein and peptides bioconjugation, for their favourable properties (such {{as the ability}} to protect the protein surface in an 'umbrella like' fashion). The discovery that mPEG(2) -LysMetbeta AlaOEt lost one mPEG chain during standard <b>base-catalysed</b> ester <b>hydrolysis</b> conditions prompted us to investigate the hydrolytic stability of such systems and the mechanism involved in the PEG chain loss. A series of branched PEGs, substituted with different aminoacids and dipeptides, have been prepared to test the influence of steric hindrance, chain lengths, ramification and Lys-AA amide substitution on hydrolysis.

40|$|Chapter 1 {{represents}} a review on the synthesis {{and structure of}} 1 -substituted 2, 2, 3, 4, 4 -pentamethylphosphetans. In Chapter 2 the stereochemistry and mechanism of <b>base-catalysed</b> phosphetanium salt <b>hydrolysis</b> are envisaged and shown to depend upon the reaction conditions, in particular the pH of the medium. The results are interpreted {{in terms of the}} intermediacy of TBP structural phosphoranes, and the most significant role of the BPR as a viable mechanism for intramolecular isomerization of such intermediates, in determining the products distribution, is discussed. The possibility of a pre-decomposition equilibrium between diastereomeric salts via pseudorotation is considered and shown to occur, specifically, in very dilute alkaline media. A change in the reaction rate-limiting step from a slow isomerization process to a phosphorane decomposition is postulated to account for variation in product composition on varying the conditions. The alkaline hydrolysis of r- 1 -substituted acetylenic 2, 2, 3 -trans- 4, 4 -pentamethylphosphetanium bromides proceeds, in contrast to the generally reported retention as the stereochemically preferred pathway for phosphetans, with complete inversion of configuration. Base-catalysed ring expansions of a number of salts are shown to proceed, stereospecifically, to give only one observable product oxide. This is attributed to a very short-lived intermediate phosphorane. In the end a qualitative scale of the relative apicophilicities of the studied groups, is observed. In Chapter 3, an attempt to synthesise the 1 : 2 adducts of 1 -substituted acetylenic- 2, 2, 3, 4, 4 -pentamethylphosphetan with HFA resulted in formation of other products for which a probable mechanism and structures, based on spectroscopic and elemental analysis data are discussed and suggested for each product. A variety of phosphoranes containing phosphetan rings was synthesised. A kinetic study of the rate of reaction of 2 -ethoxy- 1, 3, 2 -dioxaphospholan with benzil showed the reaction to follow a bimolecular step-wise mechanism. Relative apicophilicities of a number of groups attached to the phosphorus atom in phosphetan adducts were determined by monitoring the high energy isomerization pathways, accessible to these adducts, in which the five-membered rings span diequatorial positions, using 1 H n. m. r, spectroscopy techniques. The values so determined are rationalised in terms of substituent electronegativities and the extent of a probable ?-electron interaction with the phosphorus d-orbitals...|$|R

It has also allowed, for the first time, the calculation of accurate values for the rate constant and for the enthalpy change, DeltaH (hereafter H (enthalpy) for simplicity) of reaction directly from the calorimetric data, free from assumption.

Synroc is a complex, multiphase, titanate ceramic designed to immobilise High Level Waste (HLW) from nuclear reactors. The precursor powder contains TiO 2, ZrO 2, Al 2 O 3, BaO, and CaO in relative mass abundances of (70. 4 to 76. 4), (5. 5 to 8. 5), (3. 5 to 5. 5), (4. 6 to 6. 6) and (10. 1 to 12. 1) percent, respectively.

Both methods yielded phenols, methoxyphenols, benzenecarboxylic acids, alkanoic acids and hydrocarbons, but their relative amounts differed among the samples {{and for each}} sample depending on the degradation method. In relative quantitative terms, and {{when compared with the}} results obtained by 13 C NMR, it was observed that the use of TMAH led to an 'aliphatic enhancement', the extent inversely depending of temperature. Our results indicate that {{thermal degradation}}s based on reactions at 500 and 270 °C should be considered as distinct techniques, providing independent structural information in the analysis of HAs. It is suggested that transesterification and <b>base-catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> reactions occurring at a sub-pyrolysis temperature could be a successful method of mild, low-temperature alkaline degradation, but it is not sufficient for obtaining stoichiometrically representative information on the molecular assemblages of the HA structure.

These are compared with the second-order rate constants for the hydroxide ion-catalysed hydrolysis of these derivatives. There is no significant dependence of the rate of the <b>base-catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> upon the nature of the side-chain substituent. For -lactamase I, kcat/Km varies over 2 × 105 but for -lactamase II the variation with substituents is only 10. For alkyl substituents, kcat/Km increases with chain length and passes through a maximum, for -lactamase I this is with the undecyl derivative and for -lactamase II the octylcephalosporin. For -lactamase I, but not for -lactamase II, the t-butylcephalosporin is a very poor substrate. There is no evidence for a significant cavity in either enzyme to host aromatic residues. An ionised carboxylate residue on the side-chain significantly reduces reactivity with -lactamase I but not -lactamase II.

Assignment of absorption bands to various molecular species in equilibrium in aqueous solution is made by reference to their acid ionisation constants.

40|$|A {{new science}} {{strategy}} for natural fibre modification was devised in which glass surface properties would be imparted to wood-derived fibre. The enhancements known from addition of silane reagents to glass fibre–polymer composites could therefore be realised for modified cellulose fibre–polymer composites. A process is described whereby the internal void spaces and micropores of never-dried Kraft pulp fibre walls were impregnated with silica. This {{was achieved by}} initial dehydration of never-dried fibre through azeotropic distillation to achieve substitution of fibre water with the silicon chemical solution over a range of concentrations.

40|$|The {{biological}} Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of acetophenones was {{studied by}} 19 F {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR). The 19 F NMR method was used to characterise the time-dependent conversion of various fluorinated acetophenones in either whole cells of Pseudomonas fluorescens ACB or in incubations with purified 4 '-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase (HAPMO). Whole cells of P. fluorescens ACB converted 4 '-fluoroacetophenone to 4 -fluorophenol and 4 '-fluoro- 2 '-hydroxyacetophenone to 4 -fluorocatechol without the accumulation of 4 '-fluorophenyl acetates. In contrast to 4 -fluorophenol, 4 -fluorocatechol was further degraded {{as evidenced by the}} formation of stoichiometric amounts of fluoride anion. Purified HAPMO catalysed the strictly NADPH-dependent conversion of fluorinated acetophenones to fluorophenyl acetates. Incubations with HAPMO at pH 6 and 8 showed that the enzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidation occurred faster at pH 8 but that the phenyl acetates produced were better stabilised at pH 6. Quantum mechanical characteristics explained why 4 '-fluoro- 2 '-hydroxyphenyl acetate was more sensitive to <b>base-catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> than 4 '-fluorophenyl acetate. All together, 19 F NMR proved to be a valid method to evaluate the biological conversion of ring-substituted acetophenones to the corresponding phenyl acetates, which can serve as valuable synthons for further production of industrially relevant chemicals.

In compound (4) donor-acceptor nitrogen-phosphorus interactions change {{the geometry of}} the molecule from tetrahedral to quasi trigonal bipyramidal, thus the structure may be considered as an "early stage" of the intramolecular displacement of the 4 -ni trophenoxide group. In the diester (6) this interaction is replaced by intermolecular N+ -H [...] . O- hydrogen bonding. In addition the intramolecular non-bonded potential energies of (4) and (5) were calculated and the minimum-energy conformations were compared with those determined by X-ray diffraction.

40|$|Phosphate esters {{and their}} {{hydrolysis}} reactions underpin {{many of the}} most important reactions in biology and have therefore been the focus of continued research. In this thesis, a range of theoretical studies on two phosphate ester hydrolysis reactions is presented. Particular attention is paid to the role of solvent in these reactions. The first reaction studied is the hydrolysis of dimethyl phosphate. A study using density functional theory examines three possible mechanisms for this reaction in the gas phase and the presence of solvent is also considered through the use of reaction field methods. The base-catalysed mechanism for this reaction receives further attention and the reaction energy profile in solution is adiabatically mapped using two different hybrid QM/MM potentials. The use of a QM/MM potential facilitates an atomistic representation of the solvent. Another study determines the potential of mean force for this reaction by simulating the reaction using QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with umbrella sampling methods. Both QM/MM studies demonstrate that, in solution, the rate-determining step for the base-catalysed reaction is the cleavage of the bond between the phosphorous and the leaving group. The QM/MM studies also established that the reaction proceeds via the formation of a short-lived pentacoordinated intermediate species. The second reaction studied was the <b>base-catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of methyl ribose phosphate, a realistic model of the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of RNA. Since the hydrolysis of thio-substituted analogues of RNA have been the study of many experimental studies probing the mechanism of RNA hydrolysis, theoretical studies of the hydrolysis of two thio analogues of methyl ribose phosphate are also presented.

40|$|The {{central theme}} of this thesis was the {{development}} of thermoplastic starch materials and composites, their characterization and analysis of mechanical properties. X-ray diffraction methodology was developed for the quantitative interpretation of molecular structures within starch materials, and their effects on retrogradation properties. An iterative smoothing process was used to estimate and subtract the amorphous scattering contribution from X-ray spectra and thus estimate the crystallinity of both granular starches and thermoplastic starch films. The background subtraction technique was used to monitor the retrogradation of a freshly produced high amylose starch film over a five day period. The X-ray diffraction areas considered to represent both the amorphous phase and crystalline phases were separated and independently analyzed for changes over time. There appeared to be some short range ordering of the ‘amorphous’ components that enhanced scattering intensity and peak shape indicating that some dynamic molecular re-arrangements were taking place within the amylose fraction as water was lost. The mechanical properties of films made from starches of various botanical origins and one industrial chemically hydroxypropylated starch was examined. Stress-strain and dynamic mechanical analysis indicated that the hydroxypropylated and potato starch create films with the lowest modulus, highest elongation and best overall film characteristics. A high amylose starch was modified using commercially available reactive dyes to {{try to create a}} film with reduced retrogradation and similar properties to a hydroxypropylated starch film. Commercial reactive dyes reduced film retrogradation and crystallinity and improved elongation and lowered film modulus. The chemical phosphorylation of three starches, hydroxypropylated, high amylose and potato starch was conducted, and the modified starches made into thermoplastic films and mechanical properties examined. Phosphorylation efficiency was found to be dependent on starch type and phosphate concentration used. Film modulus and elongation was reduced with increasing phosphorous content. The effect of low concentrations of glycerol, borax and a combination of both glycerol and borax on hydroxypropylated starch-PVOH film mechanical properties was examined. A combination of borax and glycerol together provided thermoplastic starch polymers with increased elongation, decreased modulus and enhanced creep recovery and tensile strength with respect to a control. Due to the molecular orientation observed in extruded starch films, the addition of a plasticiser or cross-linker did not have a homogeneous effect on mechanical properties; rather it affected properties in the machine and transverse directions differently. The reactive extrusion of TEOS and thermoplastic starch to produce starch–silica composites was achieved. Reaction efficiency was determined by X-ray florescence measurement of film Si content, and efficiency was observed to improve with increasing TEOS concentration. The <b>base-catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of TEOS in situ produced well dispersed silicon dioxide particles and agglomerates that directly affected film mechanical properties. The composites produced had enhanced tensile strength but lower elongation and visco-elasticity. A wide variety of native starches, chemical modified starches and additives were trialed to create thermoplastic starch films and composites that featured a diverse range of mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{alkaline}} hydrolysis of amides follows a simple two stage mechanism, {{the first stage}} being addition of a hydroxyl ion and the second being addition of a hydroxyl ion and the second being decomposition to form the reaction products. The mechanism may be represented wither as a addition and retrogression reaction or as a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The addition reaction requires an intermediate with definite independent existence while the substitution reaction requires a transition complex with no finite period of existence. Ingold has discussed this question and has concluded that the position actually assumed is probably between the two extremes with an intermediate stabilised by mesomerism. The existence of an intermediate with a finite life has been experimentally established {{in the case of}} ester hydrolysis which is in many ways a similar reaction. The status of the intermediate in the amide reaction, as a molecule, can be assumed by analogy. The reaction is thus not a simple substitution reaction {{but on the other hand}} it is not necessarily an addition reaction as normally understood. The most acceptable interpretation of experimental results appears to be given by assuming a resonant intermediate of the dual reaction mechanism as suggested by Ingold. The rate-controlling step in the reaction mechanism is the addition of the hydroxyl ion and it is thus found that electron-attracting substituent groups on the amide accelerate, and electron-repelling groups retard, the reaction. Bevan, Hughes and Ingold have found that in some nucleophilic substitution reactions the loss of the displaced group constitutes the rate-controlling step in the reaction but experimental evidence shows that this is not so for the <b>base-catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of amides. Alkyl-groups are electron-repelling in nature and, as expected, are found to reduce the rate of hydrolysis when compared with the unsubstituted amide. The electronic properties of alkyl groups are the sum of two different effects brought about in different ways, an inductive effect and a hyperconjugative effect. In the series methyl, ethyl, iso-propyl and tert-butyl, the inductive effect increases while the hyperconjugative effect decreases through the series. Published data on similar compounds suggests that, in the simple aliphatic amides where the alkyl groups are directly bonded to the reacting group, the order of reactivity should be dictated almost entirely by the inductive effects of the alkyl groups. In the para-substituted benzamides on the other hand, where the amide group is separated from the substituent by the conjugated unsaturated system of the benzene ring, the conditions for hyperconjugation are comparatively much more favourable. The reactivity order may then be either inductive, hyperconjugative, or a mixture of both. All three of these reactivity series have been observed experimentally for different compounds which were not greatly different structurally from the p-alkylbenzamides. The actual reactivity order existing in these amides under a give set of experimental conditions cannot be forecast in any way. In p-alkyl-aromatic compounds, the order or reactivity as well as being considerably effected by minor structural changes may also be altered by changing experimental conditions. This has been observed in ethyl p-alkylbenzoates when the solvent was changed from aqueous ethanol to aqueous acetone. In the work here reported, as study of the kinetics of hydrolysis, in excess of sodium hydroxide in water, of alkyl-substituted acetamides and of p-alkylbenzamides has been carried out. The significance of the experimental results so obtained is discussed...|$|E
