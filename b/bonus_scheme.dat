EVA <b>bonus</b> <b>schemes,</b> a major managerial innovation of the 90 ’s, favor the congruence criterion. This paper questions ist properties along the controllability dimension. The question is addressed through an in-depth case study: after three years in operation the actual bonuses paid by the system, as well as qualitative feedback from the managers involved, are analyzed. It is argued that EVA <b>bonus</b> <b>schemes</b> may have a major controllability problem. EVA management compensation, controllability-congruence trade-off, compensation standards...|$|R

Our results suggest that employees who participate in productivity-linked <b>bonus</b> <b>schemes,</b> discretionary <b>bonus</b> <b>schemes,</b> share ownership or profit sharing are more optimistic about future employment and pay and are generally more satisfied with their work environment. However, employees participating specifically in profit-sharing schemes are less likely to work as hard as they can, ceteris paribus. This is an intriguing finding, insinuating as it does that group-sharing schemes are unable to rout the temptation to free ride and thereby ensure a first best cooperative equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|Aim - <b>Bonus</b> <b>schemes</b> within German {{statutory}} {{health insurance}} (GKV) use monetary incentives to promote health-conscious behaviour, particularly amongst risk groups. The {{idea is to}} exploit a latent potential for participation in money-saving preventive measures. First studies suggest that incidental effects (good risks) are more common than prevention effects. The purpose of the article is to present factors contributing to the successfulness of incentive schemes. Methods - To outline the findings of current research, {{an analysis of the}} literature was carried out. By law, sickness funds in Germany have to report on savings made. This kind of report portrays cost-efficiency but does not provide an assessment of general learning with regard to optimal practice. The analysis therefore also included studies from commercial areas in order to identify possible success factors and research needs. Results - The results of the literature analysis show that not only do the core elements of <b>bonus</b> <b>schemes</b> play a significant role, but additional elements (reminder systems, removing barriers) also help to increase the participation rate in prevention measures. Conclusion - In order to stimulate health-conscious behaviour, more attention should in future be paid to the removal of barriers to information, knowledge, and empowerment.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether long-term managerial <b>bonus</b> <b>schemes</b> {{change the}} allocative behavior of subjects {{in a laboratory}} setting. Using four different compensation schemes, we show that {{a necessary condition for}} reconciling divergent time preferences between principals and agents is a compensation scheme that induces behavior consistent with lower discount rates. Within subject results show that subjects recognize changes across compensation schemes and change their behavior as predicted by formal theory. Results also suggest that subjects become more myopic in their investment decisions if compensation contracts are incorrectly structured. experimental economics, managerial compensation, agency theory, learning...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} bonus {{contracts}} may arise endogenously {{as a response}} to agency problems within banks, and analyzes how compensation schemes change in reaction to anticipated bail-outs. If there is a risk-shifting problem, bail-out expectations lead to steeper <b>bonus</b> <b>schemes</b> and even more risk-taking. If there is an effort problem, the compensation scheme becomes flatter and effort decreases. If both types of agency problems are present, a sufficiently large increase in bailout perceptions makes it optimal for a welfare-maximizing regulator to impose caps on bank bonuses. In contrast, raising managers' liability can be counterproductive...|$|R

40|$|This {{laboratory}} experiment investigates {{the effects of}} a performance incentive scheme and financial audit threats on transfer price negotiations. Three hypotheses are developed, based on a review of transfer pricing, budget-goal setting, incentive, and auditing literatures. Experimental data are gathered over multiple periods of negotiations from forty-eight students, and are analyzed using repeated measure ANOVA. The outcome measured is firm profits. The results show that <b>bonus</b> incentive <b>scheme</b> and audit threats have no effect on firm profits. However, the interaction between the performance based <b>bonus</b> incentive <b>scheme</b> and an audit threat is significant. With both management controls, bonus incentive and audit threats, firm profits are significantly lower than under a <b>bonus</b> incentive <b>scheme</b> only. Possible reasons for these results are explored in the discussion section. In a deflationary pricing environment, study findings have implications for designing a negotiated transfer pricing mechanism in the presence of performance based incentive schemes and financial audit threats...|$|R
40|$|Several {{standard}} components of managerial compensation contracts {{have been criticized}} for encouraging managers to manipulate short-term information about the firm, thereby reducing transparency.

We show in an optimal contracting framework that these components are critical for giving long-term incentives to managers. The lack of transparency induced by the features of the contract makes it harder for the principal to engage in ex post optimal but ex ante inefficient liquidity provision to the manager.
