50|$|On March 27 1995, a man {{who made}} a bet with his friends sneaked into the lion’s den. The man stroked Chucha, the lioness, who did not react, but Marjan {{attacked}} the man and killed him within minutes. The following day, the man’s brother came and threw 3 hand grenades into the lion’s den, seriously injuring Marjan. His eyes {{had to be removed}} by MDM, a PSF (Pharmaciens Sans Frontières) Logistics Officer who first called for help, MSF doctors and an Italian photojournalist, thus rendering him blind, deaf, and permanently disabled. Despite several operations, neither Marjan’s eyesight nor his mouth could be saved. He lost all of his teeth, making it impossible for him to eat <b>boned</b> <b>meat.</b> A ramp was also built for him to get back into his den, as he was seen falling a few times while trying to make it back inside. The incident sparked outrage with animal rights activists, local and abroad. The man who threw the grenade was violently attacked a week later, and died of injuries.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{on eight}} carcasses(sheep/goat) for {{microbial}} status of meat {{at different stages}} of processing viz dressed carcass before after chilling, after boning, cocking, cooking, cooling, slicing, deep freezing, freeze drying, and packing have been carried out. No difference in microbial status has been observed in sheep and goat carcass. The lower (front body) portion of carcass has higher microbial load than the upper portion (hind body). No significant increase in total colony counts was observed on keeping the carcass for 24 hours at 5 degree centigrade. The highest microbial load has been observed on <b>boned</b> <b>meat.</b> The total colony counts (TCC) gets reduced during the process of deep freezing and freeze drying. The precooked, freeze dried meat has TCC up to 266...|$|E
40|$|Early in 2003, fresh {{outbreaks}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) were declared in Botswana and Mozambique. With annual exports of beef to the European Union worth between t 100 million and t 200 million, Botswana took immediate action: trade was suspended, {{the area in}} question was closed off and 4, 000 head of cattle were slaughtered. Similar measures had been taken in 2002. What is striking is that both countries, as well as nearby Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, have for decades had vast areas free of FMD. They are all allowed to export <b>boned</b> <b>meat</b> to the EU at low customs duties, under the ACP-EC Cotonou Agreement. Some fear, however, that the EU, which is the principal export market for meat from southern Africa, will {{go as far as}} forbidding all meat imports from the region: it is animal diseases, more than customs duties and quotas, which are now the major obstacle to international trade in animal products. Of late, attention has turned to Zimbabwe, where FMD has been declared virtually every year since 1996. The country s economy is going through a difficult period and lacks hard currency for essential imports; nor has it received any of the aid it requested for the purchase of animal vaccines. With the help of Zimbabwe s weak currency, meat smuggling is now rife and has spread the diseases into neighbouring countries. A study by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) commissioned by the British government has concluded that the abandonment of FMD control measures {{will turn out to be}} a costly mistake for Zimbabwe (official exports were reported down by 80 % in mid-May) and the entire region, whereas they had much to gain from strengthening them. But here s the rub: the costs of the measures are borne by the producer community, whereas the benefits go more to the commercial processing sector than to the poor. No wonder that the report exhorts the private sector to invest in control measures.

40|$|Advanced Meat Recovery Systems (AMRS) {{have been}} {{developed}} {{in an effort to}} simplify the deboning of meat. For {{the purpose of this paper}} deboning is the process whereby all or nearly all edible tissue is extracted from <b>bone</b> in <b>meat</b> processing operations. Historically, this was done by the skillful use of h i v e s of various kinds. More recently, motorized knives and other cutting instruments have been introduced. These make deboning more efficient and more rapid. The hand-held devices, however, have been associated with repetitive motion disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Moreover, such devices are less efficient and more contaminative than stationary machines that do not require human handling. The stationary machines of the 1960 s were criticized because of what was considered a rather crude approach to deboning consisting of the grinding of the <b>bones</b> containing the <b>meat.</b> A later step extruded the bones and bone fragments by means 6 f sieves and other mechanical devices. This process resulted in an inefficient separation of <b>bone</b> from <b>meat,</b> leaving behind a residue of bon...|$|R

Electrical stunning resulted in a significantly higher muscle pH up to 1 h postmortem after which no difference between stunned and nonstunned birds was noted.

Hot boning resulted in significantly shorter sarcomere lengths and increased meat toughness, but electrical stunning appeared to ameliorate these adverse effects. Hot boning also caused a significant decrease in percentage moisture and emulsification capacity.

5000|$|A Chinese chef's knife — {{sometimes}} referred to as a Caidao, which literally mean [...] "vegetable knife", [...] "Chinese cleaver" [...] or [...] "chopper"— is the rectangular-bladed, all-purpose knife traditionally used in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, and many other Asian countries to prepare a variety of meats, fish, and vegetables. The popularity of this style of knife has spread with the associated cuisines. They resemble Western cleavers in appearance, but most Chinese chef's knives are relatively thin-bladed and designed for slicing, chopping, and mincing vegetables, fish, and boneless meats. Heavier Gudao or bone knives are produced and are used much like Western-type meat cleavers to prepare large sides of beef, pork, and other <b>boned</b> <b>meats.</b> However, Chinese-style knives of this weight are not common in the West.|$|R
