5000|$|In February 1975, he was {{recruited}} by Ed Martin, Science and Engineering Director of Lockheed, {{to work in}} the Skunk Works as the Project Manager responsible for developing the basic airplane design concept for a DARPA/US Air Force competition to develop a low radar cross-section aircraft. Working with radar expert Denys Overholser, mathematician Bill Schroeder and senior lead airplane designer Ken Watson, they produced a design that won the competition. [...] The result was the Have <b>Blue</b> <b>technology</b> demonstrator that led to the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk. During the summer of 1976, Dick suffered a stroke and left the program. After recuperating, he returned to Lockheed a year later as Chief Advanced Design Engineer of the Skunk Works. In this position, he worked on the design of a low radar cross-section reconnaissance aircraft. In the mid-1980's the Airforce Chief Engineer for Stealth programs, Bill Elsner, has been quoted as saying [...] " [...] there would never have been a Stealth Airplane but for the genius of Dick Scherrer." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} novel {{compounds}} of marine origin {{has increased in}} the last decades for their application in various areas such as pharmaceutical, human or animal nutrition, cosmetics or bioenergy. In this context of <b>blue</b> <b>technology</b> development, microalgae are of particular interest due to their immense biodiversity and their relatively simple growth needs. In this review, we discuss about the promising use of microalgae and microalgal compounds as sources of natural antibiotics against human pathogens but also about their potential to limit microbial infections in aquaculture. An alternative to conventional antibiotics is needed as the microbial resistance to these drugs is increasing in humans and animals. Furthermore, using natural antibiotics for livestock could meet the consumer demand to avoid chemicals in food, would support a sustainable aquaculture and present {{the advantage of being}} environmentally friendly. Using natural and renewable microalgal compounds is still in its early days, but considering the important research development and rapid improvement in culture, extraction and purification processes, the valorization of microalgae will surely extend in the future...|$|E

The specifics of wheat straw composition and the chemical and thermodynamic properties of its components pre-determined the application of unit operations and engineering strategies for hydrolysis of the substrate and further its fermentation. Modeling of this two processes is crucially important for optimal overall process development and scale up. The authors gave much attention on main hydrolisis products as a glucose and xylose (C 6 and C 5 sugars, respectivelly) and on the specifics of their metabolization by ethanol producing microorganisms.
