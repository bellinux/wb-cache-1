25|$|A <b>bolas</b> <b>spider</b> is any {{of several}} species of orb-weaver spider that, instead of {{spinning}} the typical web, hunt by using a sticky 'capture blob' of silk {{on the end of}} a line, known as a 'bolas'. By swinging the bolas at flying male moths or moth flies nearby, the spider may snag its prey rather like a fisherman snagging a fish on a hook. Because of this, they are also called angling or fishing spiders (although the remotely related genus Dolomedes is also called a fishing spider). The prey is lured to the spider by the production of up to three pheromone-analogues.|$|E

50|$|The bird {{dropping}} spider (Celaenia excavata) derives {{its name}} from mimicking bird droppings to avoid predators, mainly birds. However, there are other species of spider that resemble bird droppings, for example species of Mastophora (a <b>bolas</b> <b>spider).</b>|$|E

50|$|Like all <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders,</b> {{the female}} attracts male moths with an {{airborne}} pheromone. Once a moth approaches, the spider senses it coming due to vibration sensitive hairs on its outstretched legs. It is then caught with a sticky globule that is flung at the prey.|$|R
25|$|<b>Bolas</b> <b>spiders</b> {{are small}} nocturnal animals with oddly 'lumpy' abdomens. Females may {{grow up to}} 15mm or 1/2", while the males, which are smaller, measure in at about 2mm or 1/16". Several Mastophora species (e.g. M. cornigera) look like bird droppings, which enables them to rest unnoticed at day in fairly exposed places. M. bisaccata resembles the shell of a snail that is {{abundant}} in the spider's habitat. While the bird dropping mimics rest on the upper surface of leaves, M. bisaccata rests on the undersides. If removed from the surface, Mastophora females produce a pungent odor, which is highly unusual for <b>spiders</b> (other than <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders,</b> only one species of Cyrtarachne is known to do this). They do not attempt to flee when handled. Some species of Cladomelea also rest exposed on leaves during the day. However, the Australian Ordgarius magnificus, which displays eye spots on its back that make it resemble the moth they hunt, ties leaves together with silk to form a retreat. The females of some <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders</b> look remarkably like a bird dropping, thanks to their large, globular abdomen and brownish cephalothorax. This {{is a form of}} defensive mimicry as the animals that prey on spiders pay little attention to bird droppings.|$|R
25|$|Traditional orb webs are not {{effective}} for capturing moths, because only their scales will stick, allowing the moth to escape. The ladder webs of Scoloderus species {{appear to be}} adaptations in web design to increase moth capture. These webs extend vertically about seven times their width. When a moth slides down the web, it leaves a trail of scales until its body sticks to the web. However, these spiders {{do not seem to}} be closely related to <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders.</b> The nearest relatives seems to be the Cyrtarachneae (e.g. Pasilobus) of the Paleotropics. They also specialize on moths, and use threads that are beaded with sticky droplets. Celaenia and Taczanowskia species in South America seem to use chemical attractants to catch moths, too, and may also be closely related to <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders.</b>|$|R
25|$|Every spider species {{produces}} the pheromone {{of only one}} specific moth species (or a small set) and is thus dependent on it. However, <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders</b> will try and often succeed to catch any insect that is flying nearby, aided by their good eyesight. They also seem to detect prey {{by the sound of}} their approaching flight.|$|R
50|$|The {{attraction}} of male insects to sex pheromones is exploited {{by a number}} of parties. Because finding a mate is essential for a male's reproductive success, there is strong selection on males to respond to these chemical signals. Other signallers can benefit from mimicking these pheromones, for example <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders,</b> orchids or even other males of the same species (intraspecific mimicry).|$|R
50|$|They spin small webs {{from which}} they hang upside down and attract male moths that fly into a basket formed by their legs. They use a moth {{pheromone}} for this, which resembles the one used by the <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders</b> of the genus Mastophora. The two genera are not closely related, although they {{belong to the same}} family. Thus, the same moth-catching behavior must have evolved independently in the two genera.|$|R
50|$|Some orb-weavers do {{not build}} webs at all. Members {{of the genera}} Mastophora in the Americas, Cladomelea in Africa, and Ordgarius in Australia produce sticky globules, which contain a {{pheromone}} analog. The globule is hung from a silken thread dangled by the spider from its front legs. The pheromone analog attracts male moths {{of only a few}} species. These get stuck on the globule and are reeled in to be eaten. Interestingly, both types of <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders</b> are highly camouflaged and difficult to locate.|$|R
50|$|Bolas: <b>Bolas</b> <b>spiders</b> are unusual orb-weaver spiders {{that do not}} {{spin the}} webs. Instead, they hunt by using a sticky 'capture blob' of silk {{on the end of}} a line, known as a 'bolas'. By {{swinging}} the bolas at flying male moths or moth flies nearby, the spider may snag its prey rather like a fisherman snagging a fish on a hook. Because of this, they are also called angling or fishing spider. The prey is lured to the spider by the production of up to three pheromone analogues.|$|R
50|$|Plants {{attacked}} by caterpillars have skeletonized leaves, shot holes, and dieback stems. Commonly the entire paddy crop dies within few days due to swarming attack. Hand picking and other mechanical methods {{are used to}} reduce infection. Adults can eliminated by introducing <b>Bolas</b> <b>spiders</b> to the fields. This spider {{has the ability to}} spray a pheromone similar to female moth, to attract male moths. The nematode Steinernema carpocapsae and usage of viruses like Nucleopolyhedrovirus are also effective. Moths traps like wing traps and unitraps can also used to collect adults.|$|R
5000|$|An {{allomone}} is any {{chemical substance}} released {{by an individual}} of one species that affects {{the behavior of a}} member of another species to the benefit of the originator but not the receiver.1 Production of allomones is a common form of defense, such as by plant species against insect herbivores or prey species against predators. Sometimes species produce the sex pheromones of the organisms they exploit as prey or pollinators (such as <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders</b> and some orchids). The term [...] "Allomone" [...] was proposed by Brown, Eisner, and Whittaker to denote those substances which confer an advantage upon the emitter.|$|R
5|$|In {{some cases}} of Batesian-Wallacian mimicry, {{the model is}} a sexually {{receptive}} female, which provides a strong attractive effect on males. Some spiders use chemical rather than visual means to ensnare prey. Female <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders</b> of the genus Mastophora lure male moth-flies (Diptera, true flies, but resembling moths) by producing analogues of the moth species' sex pheromones. Each species of spider appears to specialize in a particular species of prey in the family Psychodidae. Juveniles use their front pair of legs to capture prey, such as flies. Older spiders use a different strategy however, swinging a sticky ball known as a bolas suspended by a silk thread at moths. But both old and juvenile are able to lure prey via this olfactory signal; even young spiderlings {{have been shown to}} attract prey species.|$|R
500|$|Mature female <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders</b> of {{the genus}} Mastophora build [...] "webs" [...] that consist of only a single [...] "trapeze line", which they patrol. They also {{construct}} a bolas made of a single thread, tipped with a large ball of very wet sticky silk. They emit chemicals that resemble the pheromones of moths, and then swing the bolas at the moths. Although they miss on about 50% of strikes, they catch about the same weight of insects per night as web-weaving spiders of similar size. The <b>spiders</b> eat the <b>bolas</b> if they have not made a kill in about 30 minutes, rest for a while, and then make new bolas. Juveniles and adult males are much smaller and do not make bolas. Instead they release different pheromones that attract moth flies, and catch them with their front pairs of legs.|$|R
40|$|Spiders {{are well}} known as {{prolific}} and efficient predators that overwhelm their prey with potent toxins or strong silks. The deployment of cunning tactics to lure and deceive their prey is less appreciated despite a considerable history of research into deceptive spider signals. In the early twentieth century, observations already suggested {{the presence of a}} moth-luring chemical in <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders.</b> More recent technological developments have enabled researchers to uncover and quantify deceptive visual, olfactorial and vibrational signals. The evolution of these signals is intriguing as a close association between spider and prey is often required. While deceptive colour signals seem to be generic, targeting a wide range of potential prey, deception via vibrational and olfactorial signals is often more specific. The specificity of the signal in turn requires a considerable degree of plasticity in order for the spider to target more than one prey type. Our review of deceptive signals makes use of several well~studied systems with fascinating plasticity and behavioural flexibility in the deployment of the signal. 25 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Venom glands are alreadypresent in theoldes t spider group, the Mesothelae. Theglands {{lie in the}} {{anterior}} portion of the cheliceral basal segment but are very small, and it is doubtful how much the venom contributes to the predatory success. In mygalomorph spiders, the well-developed venom glands {{are still in the}} basal segment of the chelicerae and produce powerful venom that is injected via the cheliceral fangs into a victim. In all other spiders (Araneomorphae), the venom glands have become much larger and reach into the prosoma where they can take up a considerable proportion of this body part. Only a few spiders have reduced their venom glands, either partially or completely (Uloboridae, Holarchaeidae and Symphytognathidae are usually mentioned) or modified them significantly (Scytodidae, see Suter and Stratton 2013). As well as using venom, spiders may also use their chelicerae to overwhelm an item of prey. It is primarily a question of size whether a spider chews up small arthropods without applying venom or if it injects venom first. Very small and/or defenceless arthropods are picked up and crashed with the chelicerae, while larger, dangerous or well-defended items are carefully approached and only attacked with venom injection. Some spiders specialize on prey groups, such as noctuid moths (several genera of <b>bola</b> <b>spiders</b> among Araneidae), web spiders (Mimetidae), ants (Zodarion species in Zodariidae, aphantochiline thomisids, several genera among Theridiidae, Salticidae, Clubionidae and Gnaphosidae) or termites (Ammoxenidae). However, these more or less monophagous species amount only to roughly 2...|$|R
500|$|Almost all ctenophores are predators – {{there are}} no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic. If food is plentiful, they can eat 10 times their own weight per day. While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores, other surface-water species prey on {{zooplankton}} (planktonic animals) {{ranging in size from}} the microscopic, including mollusc and fish larvae, to small adult crustaceans such as copepods, amphipods, and even krill. Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts. Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey – some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as [...] "webs", some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders, and some dangle a sticky droplet {{at the end of a}} fine thread, as <b>bolas</b> <b>spiders</b> do. This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species. The two-tentacled [...] "cydippid" [...] Lampea feeds exclusively on salps, close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies, and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow. Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey: Pleurobrachias long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.|$|R
