5|$|An {{aerial survey}} later {{determined}} that the damage across the seven counties was caused by one continuous tornado, with a track estimated at 122miles (196km) in length. This was the longest single tornado track recorded in Arkansas since detailed record keeping began in 1950. Thirteen people were killed by this tornado, and about 140 people were injured. At least 200 homes and <b>businesses</b> <b>were</b> destroyed along the tornado's path. Damage from this tornado was estimated at nearly $120 million across the seven counties.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{the city}} re-emerged {{as a major}} tourist {{destination}} centered on casinos and other vice businesses. Featuring venues, such as the famed Balinese Room, the city became nationally known as the sin city of the Gulf.

5|$|In {{the first}} year of the occupation, the German {{administration}} pursued a conciliatory policy toward the Belgian people in order to gain their support and co-operation. This policy was, in part, because there was little resistance activity and because the demands the Germans needed to place on Belgian civilians and <b>businesses</b> <b>were</b> relatively small on account of their military success. During the fighting in Belgium, however, there were incidents of massacres against Belgian civilians by German forces, notably the Vinkt Massacre in which 86 civilians were killed.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, in 1902, Scott, {{a native}} commissioner, brought to Clarke's {{attention}} that many work-seekers were suffering great privation yet {{were unable to}} find work while some <b>businesses</b> <b>were</b> short of labour. Clarke took up the cause: 'This indicates the necessity of the organisation of an Association for bringing those wanting labour and those seeking employment into contact and prevent, what I have myself seen, gangs of destitute natives wandering about the country.' In 1903, a Rhodesian Native Labour Bureau was proposed.|$|E

Heavy rainfall in the New Orleans, Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama areas—aided by instability from {{the remnants of the}} depression—flooded streets, inundating an apartment complex in the former city and cutting power to 1,921 customers in the latter city. Forty homes and <b>businesses</b> <b>were</b> flooded in Avoyelles Parish. Rainfall accumulations peaked south of Natchez, Mississippi, where 13.9in (353mm) was documented.|$|E

In Beaufort County, city and county offices were closed early and <b>businesses</b> <b>were</b> advised to send their workers home prematurely. Officials in Chatham County, Georgia evacuated nursing homes on Tybee Island, and encouraged others to leave due to the potential for high tides to isolate the island by cutting off U.S. Route 80.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Tidewater region, {{there were}} {{estimates}} {{of thousands of}} downed trees, and hundreds of homes and <b>businesses</b> <b>were</b> damaged. Of these, about 40 structures were declared uninhabitable. Debris was blown several blocks inland from the coast. Among the hardest hit locations was Sandbridge, where about 12 homes were severely damaged. It is reported that the state was unprepared for the damage, expecting a strike from a weakened tropical storm. About $15.3million (1998 USD) in damage was inflicted in the Virginia Beach and Norfolk areas. Throughout the state, insured losses totaled $95million (1998 USD).|$|E

5|$|Discrimination against Jews, longstanding but extralegal {{throughout}} much of Europe at the time, was codified in Germany immediately after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April of that year, excluded most Jews from the legal profession and the civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions {{of the right to}} practise. Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to force Jews to leave the country. Jewish <b>businesses</b> <b>were</b> denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts.
