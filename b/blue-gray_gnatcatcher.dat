50|$|Black-tailed gnatcatchers live {{in pairs}} all year, {{defending}} their territory and foraging in trees and low shrubs {{for a wide}} variety of small insects and some spiders. Unlike the <b>blue-gray</b> <b>gnatcatcher,</b> the black-tailed variety rarely catches insects in midair.|$|E
50|$|The black-tailed {{gnatcatcher}} reaches about 4.5 to 5 {{inches in}} length, {{much of it}} taken up by a long black tail lined with white outer feathers. The body is blue-gray, with white underparts, {{and while it is}} similar to the <b>blue-gray</b> <b>gnatcatcher,</b> the two birds are differentiated by the amount of black in the tail feathers. The male has a black cap during the summer that extends to the eyes. Females and winter males, lacking the black cap, are difficult to distinguish from the <b>blue-gray</b> <b>gnatcatcher.</b> The best way to tell the two apart is the tail; that of the blue-gray is mostly white when viewed from below, and the black-tailed is predominantly black underneath. Like other gnatcatchers, it may give harsh, scolding calls while foraging for small insects and spiders in desert shrubs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue-gray</b> <b>gnatcatcher's</b> {{breeding}} habitat includes open deciduous {{woods and}} shrublands in southern Ontario, {{the eastern and}} southwestern United States, and Mexico. Though gnatcatcher species are common and increasing in number while expanding to the northeast, {{it is the only}} one to breed in Eastern North America. They build a cone-like nest on a horizontal tree branch. The incubation period is 13 days for both sexes. Both parents construct the nest and feed the young; they may raise two broods in a season.|$|R

40|$|This spring {{proved an}} {{exciting}} season for several reasons. For warbler fans, it described a dream {{with lots of}} birds {{to look at and}} a rather incredible species count (for anywhere) of no fewer than 381 Many 2 ̆ 2 eastern 2 ̆ 2 warblers were found westward, especially at 2 ̆ 2 islands 2 ̆ 2 of habitat such as the Geneva Cemetery and similar spots just beyond {{the western edge of the}} original eastern woodland region, as well as the Panhandle. For rarity counters, spring included no fewer than 4 first state records: Glossy Ibis, Gray Flycatcher, Black-throated Gray Warbler, and Brambling. We make here a special note that the last 3 birds were seen by Steve Dinsmore, who found the flycatcher and warbler himself through his diligent checking of that migrant trap par excellence, Oliver Reservoir. The Glossy Ibis was found by Joel Jorgensen, through his equally diligent checking of the Rainwater Basin (disclaimer: WRS wrote this!). Slightly different types of first stat records, but possibly more significant biologically, included the first confirmed breeding records this century (!) for two species: Sandhill Crane and Pileated Woodpecker. Other interesting records for various reasons were a 4 th state and 12 th North American Common Crane; an amazing 27 Red Knots in one flock; the 6 th state White-winged Dove (meanwhile the 4 th is still hanging out in Kearneyl); the 2 nd spring Hammond 2 ̆ 7 s Flycatcher; a possible Common Raven; a far out of range Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s Wren, and as many as 16 <b>Blue-gray</b> <b>Gnatcatchers</b> in the Panhandle.

40|$|This fall 2000 {{season was}} marked by a very {{westerly}} flavor to the passerine migration with many sightings of western warblers, vireos, and flycatchers in western Nebraska. Most notably, Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Vireos were seen in good numbers. Additionally, three sightings of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler and five of Dusky Flycatcher added to the excitement. In this note, we report this fall 2 ̆ 7 s sightings of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler and comment {{on the status of}} this species in Nebraska. On 26 August 2000, Dinsmore observed a Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler (Vermivora virginiae) along the north side of Oliver Reservoir. He studied the bird at close range from 9 : 52 - 10 : 05 a. m. as it foraged with a large flock of migrant passerines. The identification of the bird as a Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler was straightforward. Features noted included the generally dull gray/brown plumage, slightly paler underparts with a very dull yellowish or buff patch {{at the center of the}} breast and bright yellow undertail coverts, conspicuous white eyering. plain, unmarked wings, and the nearly constant sideways flicking of the tail. On the basis of the brown tones to the plumage, dusky underparts, lack of a rufous cap, and only a faint hint of a yellow/buff breast patch, he concluded that the bird was an immature female Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler (see Dunn and Garrett 1997). Fontaine saw this individual briefly on 27 August in the same general area. On 27 August 2000, Fontaine observed a Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler along the gravel road South of exit 1 off Interstate 80 in southwestern Kimball County. The bird was seen shortly after sunrise from 6 : 45 - 6 : 50 a. m. foraging in a stand of Limber Pine approximately 15 meters from the roadside. The Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler was in the company of a loose flock of migrants composed of Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, <b>Blue-gray</b> <b>Gnatcatchers,</b> and a Brown Thrasher. The bird was seen flicking its tail as it moved from tree to tree. Based on the clean gray breast and bold lemon yellow undertail coverts, he concluded the bird was an adult female...|$|R
40|$|In most respects, {{this was}} a routine spring. While a few rarities and several {{interesting}} reports appeared, perhaps most interesting was {{the arrival of the}} electronic age. Foremost was the start-up of 2 ̆ 2 NEBIRDS, 2 ̆ 2 the Nebraska Birding Listserver set up and operated by Robert Price at Kearney. This resource should greatly enhance communication and collective learning amongst birders in the state. We have culled several reports from observations submitted to NEBIRDS, and several reporters now contact us by email. We urge observers to forward their email addresses; if we have questions on their reports, communication would be easy! Submit reports and comments to Ross Silcock by email at silcock@sidney. heartland. net. We also gather sightings reported to the Nebraska Birdline, operated by Loren and Babs Padelford at Bellevue; these reports are placed on the Internet through BIRDCNTR, a service of the National Bird Hotline Cooperative. We should note here that this report contains unverified observations as well as documented observations. And now to the birds! Considerable discussion has taken place about a very 2 ̆ 2 slow 2 ̆ 2 warbler migration, 2 ̆ 2 slow 2 ̆ 2 for birders, meaning low numbers of birds, While this is true, most species were indeed found, although very low numbers were found of Magnolia, Black-throated Green, Blackburnian, and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, and those that were reported occurred rather late in the migration period. Usually when we do not see many migrating warblers it means they have made long, non-stop flights with beneficial tailwinds right over us to their breeding ranges. Much has been made of the scarcity of migrant warblers this spring in the eastern United States, with blame allocated to habitat loss in the tropical wintering ranges, to forest fragmentation in the breeding ranges (in particular with the result of allowing cowbird access to deep-woods birds), and to extensive smoke encountered while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. The smoke, from major fires in Mexico, may have contributed to a slower migration for some species, but we will have to be patient (a human generation or two?) to see what if anything is actually happening. Joel Jorgensen, who did weekly surveys of the eastern Rainwater Basin in April and May, gathered important shorebird data. These data are presented in the relevant shorebird species accounts. Although few early and late dates were set, a few amazing high counts occurred during the report period: for example, 39 Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Grebes, 236 Horned Grebes, and 1, 732 McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspurs. Some interesting waterfowl appeared in the Rainwater Basin this spring, suggesting that scrutiny of the immense flocks can yield exciting discoveries: 2 nd state Bean Goose, 2 nd state Garganey, and even a Barnacle Goose, probably not a wild bird.

50|$|Host species {{sometimes}} {{notice the}} cowbird egg, with different hosts {{reacting to the}} egg in different ways. Some, like the <b>blue-gray</b> <b>gnatcatcher,</b> abandon their nest, losing their own eggs as well. Some, like the American yellow warbler, bury the foreign egg under nest material, where it perishes. And some, like the brown thrasher, physically eject the egg from the nest. Experiments with gray catbirds, a known cowbird host, have shown that this species rejects cowbird eggs more than 95% of the time; for this species, the cost of accepting cowbird eggs (i.e. {{the loss of their}} own eggs or nestlings through starvation or the actions of the nestling cowbird) was far higher than the cost of rejecting those eggs (i.e. where the host might conceivably eject its own egg accidentally). Brown-headed cowbird nestlings are also sometimes expelled from the nest. Nestlings of host species can also alter their behavior in response to the presence of a cowbird nestling. Song sparrow nestlings in parasitized nests alter their vocalizations in frequency and amplitude so that they resemble the cowbird nestling, and these nestlings tend to be fed equally often as nestlings in unparasitized nests.|$|E
5000|$|The {{forests are}} a part of the {{temperate}} deciduous forest that extends from Florida north to eastern Canada. [...] The mixed plains ecozone has the highest plant diversity in Canada, with the Lake Erie lowland having trees species that occur nowhere else in Canada. Within Canada, these forest types are often referred to as the 'Carolinian zone' owing to the many southern plants and animals that reach their northern limits here. Clearing for agriculture and urbanization have reduced natural forest cover to less than ten percent. An overview of the flora and fauna of this distinctive region is available in The Natural Treasures of Carolinian Canada. A few of the many examples of southern species found here include the hooded warbler, king rail, prothonotary warbler, <b>blue-gray</b> <b>gnatcatcher,</b> American badger, opossum, and eastern spiny softshell turtle. Past work has identified 38 critical natural areas, and an initiative known as The Big Picture aims to restore natural corridors as part of a natural heritage system. Some of the critical core areas in this region include Point Pelee, Long Point, Rondeau Park, Skunk's Misery, Backus Woods and Willoughby Marsh.|$|E
50|$|Other {{assorted}} {{birds are}} taken seemingly at random opportunity. The predatory {{effect of this}} species on other raptorial birds, which is often considerable, is explored in the following section. In Brazil, it {{was found in a}} small study that birds overall outnumbered mammals in pellets, although most were not determined to species and the ones that were shown a tremendously diverse assemblage of birds with no obvious dietary preference. Although not usually numerically significant, 86 species of passerine have been taken by great horned owls. Members from most North American families are known as prey, although among smaller types such as chickadees, warblers, sparrows, cardinals, wrens and most tyrant flycatchers only a few species from each have been recorded. Nonetheless, an occasionally unlucky migrant or local breeder is sometimes snatched. Fledgling songbirds are regularly taken in spring and summer. The smallest avian prey known for great horned owls are the 5.8 g <b>blue-gray</b> <b>gnatcatcher</b> (Polioptila caerulea) and the 6.2 g ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula). Somewhat larger bodied families are more prominent, i.e. the corvids (14 species) and icterids (14 species) and, secondarily, the kingbirds (Tyrannus ssp.), thrushes, mimids and European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). This is likely {{due to the fact that}} the larger passerines usually roost in relatively open spots and have larger, more conspicuous nests. Crows and ravens tend to be grabbed off of their communal roosts by night.|$|E
50|$|Prairie {{remnants}} {{are present}} on the south-facing ridge and have recovered from previous agricultural use due to intensive management that began in 1995. Plant species include big bluestem, little bluestem, Indian grass, side-oats grama, wood betony, bird's-foot violet, purple prairie clover, wood sorrel, and the uncommon prairie turnip (Pediomelum esculentum). Numerous large bur and white oaks are found further up the slope where the land transitions to oak savannas. Plant species found here include numerous grass, sedge, and forb species including the state-endangered purple milkweed (Asclepias purpurascens). Other plants include silky rye, bottlebrush grass, ear-leaved brome, leadplant, large-flowered yellow false foxglove, Canada milk-vetch, Illinois tick-trefoil, alum-root, shooting star, and spiderwort. Other rare plants present are the state-threatened giant yellow hyssop (Agastache nepetoides), and special concern upland boneset (Eupatorium sessilifolium). Over the ridgetop, the cooler north-facing slope is mostly oak woodland with red oak, basswood, hackberry, butternut, yellowbud hickory, and red maple. Spring ephemerals are abundant here, including bloodroot, Jacob's-ladder, large-flowered bellwort, yellow lady's-slipper orchid, large white trillium, and dutchman's breeches.

[...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Biological SciencesThe Neotropical-migratory Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea) {{is one of}} North America's strongest declining songbirds. Alterations of {{breeding}} ground habitat are a potential primary cause of decline, versus wintering and migration habitat alterations being a primary factor driving population decline. Evaluating the influence of these hypotheses on population trends could reallocate the limited resources of conservation efforts. For the Cerulean, two studies show that annual adult migration survival reflects the range expected for non-declining species (40 - 60 % winter/migration survival), whereas annual reproductive output is very low throughout its breeding range. This suggests a strong role for events on the breeding grounds in its population decline. As an independent test of this qualitative model, annual survival and reproduction were measured in a non-declining <b>Blue-gray</b> <b>Gnatcatcher</b> (Polioptila cerulea). Annual survival of the <b>Blue-gray</b> <b>Gnatcatcher</b> was predicted {{to be similar to}} that of the Cerulean, but reproduction of the Gnatcatcher to be significantly higher. Results from two field seasons (April-August 2011 and 2012) of <b>Blue-gray</b> <b>gnatcatcher</b> data were rigorously compared to six field seasons of data on the Cerulean warbler collected by Christopher M. Rogers (May-June 2003 - 2008). All statistical measures that were assessed regarding were contrary to original predictions. Cerulean warblers had higher nest success, equal nest output per successful nest, a higher number of female fledglings per female within the study populations and a higher rate of survival over wintering and migration. It is speculated that there was a great influence of drought on the two field seasons of <b>Blue-gray</b> <b>gnatcatcher</b> data collection...|$|E
