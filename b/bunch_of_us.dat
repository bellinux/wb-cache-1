Then a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> took it home to our own children and they loved it." [...] The Naked Brothers Band television series ran from 2007 to 2009. Draper was the creator, head writer, executive producer, and director, while Hecht was the other executive producer and his production company Worldwide Biggies distributed the series.

5000|$|Walter Hill {{said the}} film was [...] "not a simple action movie where the people chasing the other out there is bad":It is clearly {{in a sense the}} kind of fault of our guys for getting into this situation. In the {{collective}} group, there are individuals who are not as highly evolved as the others. And the answers to the dilemma, I mean both nature's noblemen, those of higher character through some innate quality. And you have people that operate on a sliding scale downward to the brute level in their response to the situation that they have gotten themselves into. All of which I think is a kind of, war is terrible. It's a wartime situation. With mixed results and accompanying paranoia even by those who are {{the best and the brightest}} <b>of</b> the <b>bunch...</b> None <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are quite as good or bad as we construct them. Southern Comfort is trying not to be an easy drama.|$|R
500|$|On December 6, 2010, two colored vinyl {{editions of}} Old Record were released. In an {{interview}} with USA Today in 2011, McKinnon said that the band [...] "had a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> people tell <b>us</b> we'd sold out — and that was our first album" [...] when they had released And Their Name Was Treason. On July 2, 2013, Victory announced that Old Record was to be reissued again on vinyl, in 3 different colors, from July 9: standard black, and limited edition copies of both pink and clear with black smoke. In an October 2013 interview, McKinnon revealed the band had to re-record the whole album {{in a couple of}} days due to pressure from Victory-owner Tony Brummel. McKinnon was [...] "absolutely [...] ashamed" [...] it was released as he thought the band had [...] "butchered it. Because it was two days [...]" ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{underwent}} a change during mid-1970: [...] "I got stoned {{for the first}} time; I discovered Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas, and all that classic stuff. I read Moby Dick and went back as a junior taking creative writing classes." [...] Jobs also later noted to his official biographer that [...] "I started {{to listen to music}} a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of just science and technology—Shakespeare, Plato. I loved King Lear ... when I was a senior I had this phenomenal AP English class. The teacher was this guy who looked like Ernest Hemingway. He took a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> snowshoeing in Yosemite." [...] From that point, Jobs developed two different circles of friends: those who were involved in electronics and engineering and those who were interested in art and literature. These dual interests were particularly reflected during Jobs's senior year as his best friends were Wozniak and his first girlfriend, the artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan.|$|E

60|$|For several days, in {{snow and}} rain, General Schofield's little army had {{crouched}} in its hastily constructed defenses at Columbia, Tennessee. It had retreated in hot haste from Pulaski, thirty {{miles to the}} south, arriving {{just in time to}} foil Hood, who, marching from Florence, Alabama, by another road, with a force of more than double our strength, had hoped to intercept us. Had he succeeded, he would indubitably have bagged the whole <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> As it was, he simply took position in front of us and gave us plenty of employment, but did not attack; he knew a trick worth two of that.|$|E

5000|$|Based on a folktale, {{the story}} follows {{the life of}} a mustachioed cap {{salesman}} who wears his entire stock of caps on his head; they consist of his own checked cap, then a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> grey caps, a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> brown caps, a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> blue caps and finally a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> red caps on the very top.

6000|$|But {{that money}} {{was made in the}} Pen I had direct evidence, for I was cell-mate quite a time with the Third Hall-man. He had over sixteen dollars. He used to count his money every night after nine o'clock, when we were locked in. Also, he used to tell me each night what he would do to me if I gave away on him to the other hall-men. You see, he was afraid of being robbed, and danger {{threatened}} him from three different directions. There were the guards. A couple of them might jump upon him, give him a good beating for alleged insubordination, and throw him into the [...] "solitaire" [...] (the dungeon); and in the mix-up that sixteen dollars of his would take wings. Then again, the First Hall-man could have taken it all away from him by threatening to dismiss him and fire him back to hard labor in the prison-yard. And yet again, there were the ten of us who were ordinary hall-men. If we got an inkling of his wealth, there was a large liability, some quiet day, of the whole <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> getting him into a corner and dragging him down. Oh, we were wolves, believe me--just like the fellows who do business in Wall Street.|$|E

60|$|When I {{arrived at}} the depot, I found, much to my disgust, a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> at least twenty tramps that were waiting to ride out the blind baggages of the overland.

50|$|Some {{members of}} the {{original}} Skrewdriver line-up objected strongly to the new direction in which Donaldson took the band. Roger Armstrong of Chiswick Records said:It is a shame that the name was dragged through the gutter like that. The other three guys in the band were really pissed off too. Grinny the drummer came from solid northern socialist stock... When they made records for us Ian Stuart {{showed no signs of}} fascism.

5000|$|Following {{the release}} of the film's trailer, narrator Kate Mulgrew said that she was misinformed about the purpose of the documentary.

[...] George Ellis corroborated. [...] "I was interviewed for it but they did not disclose this agenda, which of course is nonsense.

The remaining members are there for support and to encourage the band [...] "spiritually, musically, and missionally." [...] They explained noticing a sense of hostility from the modern culture towards the church and Christians therefore sought to create music that would draw such individuals spiritually and encourage them to come back to church.|$|E
