5|$|Sea snakes are {{generally}} reluctant to bite, {{and are usually}} considered to be mild-tempered, although variation is seen among species and individuals. Some species, such as P. platurus, which feed by simply gulping down their prey, {{are more likely to}} bite when provoked because they seem to use their venom more for defense. Others, such as Laticauda, use their venom for prey immobilization; these snakes are often handled without concern by local fishermen, who unravel and toss them <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> barehanded when the snakes become entangled in fishing nets. Species reported as much more aggressive include Aipysurus laevis, Astrotia stokesii, Enhydrina schistosa, Enhydrina zweifeli, and Hydrophis ornatus.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{are often}} killed for shark fin soup. Fishermen capture live sharks, fin them, and dump the finless animal <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Shark finning {{involves}} removing the fin {{with a hot}} metal blade. The resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators. Shark fin {{has become a major}} trade within black markets all over the world. Fins sell for about $300/lb in 2009. Poachers illegally fin millions each year. Few governments enforce laws that protect them. In 2010 Hawaii became the first U.S. state to prohibit the possession, sale, trade or distribution of shark fins. From 1996 to 2000, an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a complex}} mythology {{concerning}} <b>the</b> living <b>waters,</b> focused on <b>the</b> spirits, pulany, dangerous or benign, that are thought to inhabit them, and {{are thought to be}} responsible for the seasonal replenishment of these water places (ngapa). Special ceremonies are undertaken to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>water</b> beings make rain. Camping is avoided in such sites. The presence of such water snakes is often attested by panyjin reeds, the whiskers of the pulany, which can travel underground to emerge from tulkarru holes.There exists a Karajarri song to entice <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>the</b> ancestral serpent if a spring dries up, in order to refresh the aquifer. It is transmitted for such an emergency, though circumstances have never changed to require its recitation.|$|R

5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{the highest}} {{pollution}} levels remained concentrated in Snow and Choccolocco Creeks.

25|$|Disney {{originally}} planned to serve shark fin soup, a traditional Chinese delicacy, at wedding banquets. Animal rights groups protested in June 2005, citing the declining shark population in global waters and the cruel methods sometimes used of cutting the fin and discarding the live sharks <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{native plants}} used in wildflower gardens often have deep root systems. This makes them good plants for {{absorbing}} runoff and allowing <b>the</b> <b>water</b> to filter <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> local <b>water</b> table.

5000|$|There {{are a few}} {{stories of}} {{encounters}} with this great beast. A Jesuit missionary named Claude Dablon told a story about four Ojibwa Indians who embarked on a journey {{to the home of}} [...] to take some copper back to their home, and use it to heat <b>water.</b> <b>The</b> very second they pushed off and <b>backed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> with their canoe, the eerie voice of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> panther surrounded them. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> panther came growling after them, vigorously accusing them of stealing the playthings of his children. All four of the Indians died {{on the way back to}} their village; the last one surviving just long enough to tell the tale of what had happened in his final moments before he died.|$|R
50|$|In June 2009, {{there was}} a report of a {{sighting}} off the island of Giglio, in Italy. On 7 January 2010, fishermen spotted an injured Mediterranean monk seal off the coasts of Tel Aviv, Israel. When zoo veterinarians arrived to help the seal, it had slipped <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters.</b> Members of <b>the</b> Israel Marine Mammal Research and Assistance Center arrived at the scene and tried to locate the injured mammal, but with no success. This was the first sighting of the species in the region since Lebanese authorities claimed to have found a population of 10-20 other seals on their coasts 70 years earlier. In addition, the seal was also sighted {{a couple of weeks later}} in the northern kibbutz of Rosh Hanikra.|$|R
25|$|In modern {{bass fishing}} competitions, caught bass {{are placed in}} a live well, and {{released}} as soon as caught and weighed by officials. Competitors are penalized heavily for dead fish {{and in some cases}} dead fish are not weighed. Fish turned in for weighing are immediately released or placed in tanks and treated for stress and glyco-protein (slime coat) injury, then released <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{least two}} Egyptian newspapers, Al Gomhuria and Al-Musawar, offered {{theories}} that the aircraft was accidentally {{shot down by}} the US. Other theories were advanced by the Egyptian press as well, including the Islamist Al Shaab, which speculated that a Mossad/CIA conspiracy was to blame (since, supposedly, EgyptAir and El Al crews stayed at the same hotel in New York). Al Shaab also accused US officials of secretly recovering the FDR, reprogramming it, and throwing it <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> to be publicly recovered.|$|E
25|$|The eleven {{locomotives}} in {{the class}} had condensing apparatus that fed the exhaust steam <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> tanks. The tanks themselves were shortened {{to make room for}} the external exhaust pipes and were extended down to the footplate in front of the cab to increase their capacity. As condensing the steam heated the water, a reciprocating pump (Weir pump) was fitted as a boiler feedwater pump because standard injectors will not work with hot water. The pumps led to (unsuccessful) tests with these locomotives acting as fire engines during World War II.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>waters</b> around Hilton Head Island {{are one of}} the {{few places}} on Earth where {{dolphins}} routinely use a technique called [...] "strand feeding", whereby schools of fish are herded up onto mud banks, and the dolphins lie on their side while they feed before sliding <b>back</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R
25|$|Simply stated, {{reclaimed}} {{water is}} {{water that is}} used more than one time before it passes <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>water</b> cycle.

50|$|Proponents for snowmelters {{claim that}} these {{essentially}} {{speed up the}} natural snowmelting process. They discharge <b>the</b> melt <b>water</b> <b>into</b> storm drains and sewer systems where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is treated and released <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> local <b>water</b> systems. However they consume {{substantial amount of energy}} and the burning flames produce carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.|$|R
25|$|After {{killing the}} guards, Mike rescues Steven. The three float downriver {{on a tree}} limb. An American {{helicopter}} finds them, but only Nick is able to climb aboard. The weakened Steven falls <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> and Mike plunges in the water to rescue him. Mike helps Steven to reach the river bank, but Steven's legs are broken, so Mike carries him through the jungle to friendly lines. Approaching a caravan of locals escaping the war zone, Mike stops a South Vietnamese military truck and places the wounded Steven on it, asking the soldiers {{to take care of}} him.|$|E
25|$|The dorsal or {{upper side}} of each radiole has a ciliated {{longitudinal}} radiolar food groove running down its center, extending along its longitudinal axis from the tip {{to the center of}} the crown. Planktonic food particles are swept into these grooves, where they become trapped in a coating of mucus. At this point, the animal subjects the particles to an examination and selection process, whereby any particles determined to be unsuitable due to size or chemical composition are rejected by the animal and discarded <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> column. Once the selection process is complete, the cilia transport the particles towards the mouth, from where they enter the digestive tract.|$|E
25|$|In May 2011, Westwood contested {{a playoff}} at the BMW PGA Championship with fellow Englishman {{and at the}} time world number two Luke Donald. On the par five 18th, Donald hit his {{approach}} shot into the green leaving six feet for birdie. Westwood attempted to follow him in close to the hole but got too much backspin on his pitch and the ball spun <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> hazard. Westwood eventually chipped up from the drop zone and went on to make double bogey. Donald then holed his birdie putt to win the championship and in the process became the new world number one.|$|E

50|$|Crossing to the {{northeast}} of Luzon, Amy maintained strength, rapidly approaching the island of Taiwan on September 4. The storm slowly weakened to a 115 mph (185 km/h) typhoon {{off the coast of}} Taiwan, making landfall on September 5 near the city of Yilan City. Amy weakened over land slightly before making landfall near Fuzhou later that day. Amy crossed over mainland China for several days, slowly weakening into a minimal tropical storm before crossing <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of <b>the</b> East China Sea near Yancheng. Amy strengthened back to winds of 45 mph (65 km/h) before weakening into a tropical depression off the coast of South Korea. The depression made landfall near Incheon on September 7, weakening over land. After crossing out <b>into</b> open <b>waters,</b> <b>the</b> remains of Amy became extratropical on September 8, affected by the cold air.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the pH and {{salinity}} {{levels of}} <b>the</b> ocean <b>water,</b> organic matter will decay and releases phosphorus from sediment in shallow basins. Bacteria and enzymes dissolve organic matter on <b>the</b> <b>water</b> bottom interface, thus returning phosphorus {{to the beginning}} of its biogenic cycle. Mineralization of organic matter can also cause the release of phosphorus <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ocean <b>water.</b>|$|R
25|$|Then the swimmer shrugs their {{shoulders}} and throws their arms and shoulders forward, lunging cat-like <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> (though the emphasis is to go forward, not down). As the swimmer sinks, they arch their back, and kicks. Timing {{is very important in}} order for the kick to transfer all of its force via the arched back, but the optimum time is when the arms are 3/4 extended. Then the swimmer kicks and presses on their chest, undulating a little underwater, and squeezing the gluteus maximus to prevent the legs and feet from rising out of the water. The swimmer has now returned to the streamlined position, and the cycle starts again.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{disinfection}} {{in the treatment}} of waste water is to substantially reduce the number of microorganisms in the water to be discharged back into the environment for the later use of drinking, bathing, irrigation, etc. The effectiveness of disinfection depends {{on the quality of the}} water being treated (e.g., cloudiness, pH, etc.), the type of disinfection being used, the disinfectant dosage (concentration and time), and other environmental variables. Cloudy water will be treated less successfully, since solid matter can shield organisms, especially from ultraviolet light or if contact times are low. Generally, short contact times, low doses and high flows all militate against effective disinfection. Common methods of disinfection include ozone, chlorine, ultraviolet light, or sodium hypochlorite. Chloramine, which is used for drinking water, is not used {{in the treatment of}} waste water because of its persistence. After multiple steps of disinfection, the treated water is ready to be released <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> cycle by means of the nearest body of water or agriculture. Afterwards, the water can be transferred to reserves for everyday human uses.|$|E
25|$|If Charlie {{is uncomfortable}} with Nancy and her desires, he has bigger {{problems}} with the lizards. At first, he insists {{that they are a}} death hallucination caused by rotten liver paste sandwiches. While the creatures intrigue Nancy, Charlie continually acts with fear and resistance. He follows his wife's lead on posing submissively when the creatures first approach, but he will not respond to them until she orders him to. Even after the ice has been broken, Charlie remains uncertain about the creatures and their intentions. Leslie and Sarah's ignorance on many things (emotions, anatomy, etc.) adds to Charlie's negative attitude. When he has to explain these ideas to them, he is easily frustrated and often condescending. He drives Leslie to beat and choke him. Yet at the end, Charlie agrees with Nancy that the lizards have to stay on land and not go <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Though he helps because Nancy will do it whether or not he agrees, Charlie does offer to take them by the hand.|$|E
50|$|Other local {{ranchers and}} water {{companies}} were {{caught off guard}} by the settlement. <b>The</b> Nuevo <b>Water</b> Company had been negotiating with the MWD since 1936 to have <b>the</b> seepage <b>water</b> pumped higher up the San Jacinto River where it could be allowed to sink <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>water</b> table.

50|$|Throughout history, waste {{has been}} {{generated}} by humans. In areas with {{low population density}} waste generation may have been negligible. In higher population areas even largely biodegradable waste had to be dealt with. Sometimes this was released <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>water</b> with environmental impact like Nor Loch. The Maya of Central America had a fixed monthly ritual, in which {{the people of the}} village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps.|$|R
50|$|In {{the sixth}} hour the most {{significant}} event in the underworld occurs. The ba (or soul) of Ra unites with his own body, or alternatively with the ba of Osiris within the circle formed by the mehen serpent. This event is {{the point at which}} the sun begins its regeneration; it is a moment of great significance, but also danger, as beyond it in hour 7 the adversary Apep (Apophis) lies in wait and has to be subdued by the magic of Isis, and the strength of Set assisted by Serqet. Once this has been done the sun god opens the doors of the tomb in hour 8 and then leaves the sandy island of Sokar by rowing vigorously <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> in hour 9. In hour 10 the regeneration process continues through immersion in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> until in hour 11 the god's eyes (a symbol for his health and well being) are fully regenerated. In hour 12 he enters the eastern horizon ready to rise again as the new day's sun.|$|R
25|$|Liam reconciles with Charlie after a heart-to-heart {{conversation}} {{in which they}} discuss the physical abuse they endured as children. After Charlie discovers that Annie has true feelings for Liam, he leaves to study abroad in France, leaving Annie and Liam to start a relationship. Annie begins to have other troubles, however, when her cousin Emily visits from Kansas. Emily starts to take over things in Annie's life; her friends, her acting roles, her internship, and her relationship with Liam. Annie and Liam {{find a way to}} prove Emily's scheming ways to everyone, running her out of town. Teddy has continued to struggle with his homosexuality and his feelings for Ian. After being blackmailed anonymously, and with encouragement from Ian, he decides to come out to his friends. He later discovers that Ian was the one who blackmailed him, and breaks up with him. After a serious accident during surf practice, Ivy is prescribed medical marijuana to help relieve anxiety, and meets Raj. Raj reveals to Ivy that he has cancer and they start a close friendship that blossoms into a relationship after he helps her recover from her fear of getting <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Adrianna's secret about stealing Javier's song book is revealed by Victor, which damages her burgeoning career. Navid and Silver have developed a secret relationship. Navid breaks up with Adrianna due to her new self-centered behavior, after which Adrianna discovers that Navid had been cheating on her with Silver. During a retreat, Naomi meets Guru Sona, whom she believes to have good intentions, but later realizes that she scammed her out of a large sum of money. A nerdy guy, Max, helps her get her money back, after which Naomi develops feelings for him. Naomi and Max begin secretly dating to protect their respective reputations, but after the pressure to keep things a secret become too much for Naomi, they decide to out their relationship.

Later though, Adrianna deceives Silver and switches her bipolar medication with placebos, causing Silver to spin out of control. After noticing Silver's strange behavior, Navid and Dixon intervene and have Silver committed to a mental hospital.|$|E
500|$|Along {{the beaches}} and tidal marshes of South Carolina and Georgia in the United States, {{bottlenose}} dolphins cooperatively herd prey fish onto steep and sandy banks in a practice known as [...] "strand feeding". [...] Groups of {{between two and}} six dolphins are regularly observed creating a bow wave to force the fish out of the water.

500|$|Although in-water {{recompression}} {{is regarded}} as risky, and to be avoided, there is increasing evidence that technical divers who surface and demonstrate mild DCS symptoms may often get <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and breathe pure oxygen at a depth [...] for a period to seek to alleviate the symptoms. This trend is noted in paragraph 3.6.5 of DAN's 2008 accident report. The report also notes that whilst the reported incidents showed very little success, [...] "e must recognize that these calls were mostly because the attempted IWR failed. In case the IWR were successful, [...] diver would not have called to report the event. Thus {{we do not know}} how often IWR may have been used successfully." ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{example is}} the {{esterification}} of benzoic acid and n-butanol where the ester product is trapped and the butanol, immiscible with <b>the</b> ester flows <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reactor.

50|$|Oxford {{geographer}} Nick Middleton's {{television series}} and accompanying book Going to Extremes, {{in which he}} discusses his visit to this village and describes ways in which inhabitants cope with the extreme cold. Middleton describes how Oymyakon lies between two mountain ranges, trapping cold air between throughout the year. In the winter, once every two days, the village's cattle's herd bull was harnessed between the shafts of a sledge with a big water tank on it {{and led to the}} spring. The men broke the ice on the spring, let the bull drink its fill, filled <b>the</b> <b>water</b> tank from <b>the</b> spring, and let the bull pull <b>the</b> tanker sledge <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> warm. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> spring was naturally warm and so stayed liquid below the surface ice.|$|R
