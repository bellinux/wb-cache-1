5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes {{as a prelude}} to mating. One is a sequence of short squeaks; the other is made up of consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can <b>be</b> <b>brief</b> or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also make the call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating system}} of bears has {{variously}} {{been described as}} a form of polygyny, promiscuity and serial monogamy. During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously {{over a period of several}} days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may <b>be</b> <b>brief,</b> although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.|$|E
5|$|Normandie and Languedoc {{were ordered}} on 12 December 1912, {{followed}} by Flandre and Gascogne on 30 July 1913. Béarn was ordered on 3 December; the five ships would permit {{the creation of}} two four-ship divisions with the three Bretagne-class ships then under construction. Work on the class was suspended at the outbreak of World War I, as all resources were needed for the Army. The government did not immediately mobilize for war, as they expected the conflict to <b>be</b> <b>brief.</b> The first four ships were launched {{after the start of}} the war, but only to clear the slipways for other purposes. In July 1915, the Navy determined that the ships were not a priority, and prohibited further work. Later in July, work on the ships' armament was suspended, save the guns themselves, which could be converted for use by the Army. Four of the completed 340mm guns were converted into railway guns for the French Army. Nine of the guns built for Languedoc were also mounted on railway carriages in 1919, {{after the end of the}} war. Several of the 138.6mm guns were also converted for service with the Army.|$|E

25|$|Clipstone {{became a}} favoured {{residence}} of the monarchy for over two hundred years. The historian David Crook listed the following visits: Henry II in 1181 and 1185, Richard I in 1194, John in 1200, 1201, 1205, 1210 and 1215, Henry III in 1244, 1251 and 1255, Edward I in 1279, 1280, 1284, 1290 and 1300, Edward II in 1307, 1315, 1316, 1317, 1318 and 1320, Edward III in 1327, 1328, 1330, 1331, 1332, 1334, 1335, 1345 and 1363, and Richard II in 1387 and 1393 Such visits could <b>be</b> <b>brief,</b> such as John's overnight stay on 19 March 1200.|$|E

25|$|Much civil-defence {{preparation}} {{in the form}} of shelters was left in the hands of local authorities and many areas such as Birmingham, Coventry, Belfast and the East End of London did not have enough shelters. The unexpected delay to civilian bombing during the Phoney War meant that the shelter programme finished in June 1940, before the Blitz. The programme favoured backyard Anderson shelters and small brick surface shelters; many of the latter were abandoned in 1940 as unsafe. Authorities expected that the raids would <b>be</b> <b>brief</b> and in daylight, rather than attacks by night, which forced Londoners to sleep in shelters.|$|E
25|$|Il Lavoratore (The Worker) (June 1924 – September 1931) — In 1924, the Workers Party of America's press nexus {{moved from}} New York City to Chicago. The New York Italian-language weekly L'Alba Nuova was supplanted {{by a new}} Chicago daily at this time, Il Lavoratore, edited by Antonio Presi of that earlier publication. This Chicago phase proved to <b>be</b> <b>brief,</b> however, as in 1925 Il Lavoratore was moved back to New York and made a weekly, with G. Cannata at the {{editorial}} desk. The paper strove to build a united front against the fascist Mussolini government in Italy and covered trade union activities from a radical rank-and-file perspective. The publication's claimed circulation in 1925 was 12,500.|$|E

Beginning in January 1956, the 3d Bombardment Group converted from the aging World War II era B-26 to the jet-powered Martin B-57B Canberra Night Intruder. However, the USAF was not {{very happy with the}} B-57B as it was initially produced. It was deemed to be inadequate to meet the night intruder and close support role for which it had originally been designed. The service life of the B-57B with USAF tactical bomb groups was planned to <b>be</b> <b>brief.</b> After three years of service with the B-57s in tactical bomb groups, {{the decision was made to}} phase out the B-57.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the rest}} of the century was {{occupied}} with civil strife such as the insurrection of Francisco Ortega against the federal government, the Reform War and the French Intervention. The last provoked the Battle of Puebla on 5 May 1862, when 6,000 French troops attacked the forts named Loreto and Guadalupe outside of the city of Puebla, but they were repelled by forces under Ignacio Zaragoza. Zaragoza died some months after this battle, and he would be later honored by having his name added to that of the city. However, less than a year later, the city would be taken and shortly after, Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico would be installed. However, his rule would <b>be</b> <b>brief</b> and the French, along with their conservative Mexican allies, were expelled from the state in 1867.|$|E
25|$|Raw {{foie gras}} can be roasted, sauteed, pan-seared (poêlé) or (with care and attention), grilled. As foie gras has high fat content, contact with heat needs to <b>be</b> <b>brief</b> and {{therefore}} at high temperature, lest it burn or melt. Optimal structural integrity for searing requires the foie gras {{to be cut}} to a thickness between 15 and 25mm (½ – 1inch), resulting in a rare, uncooked center. Some chefs prefer not to devein the foie gras, as the veins can help preserve {{the integrity of the}} fatty liver. It is increasingly common to sear the foie gras on one side only, leaving the other side uncooked. Practitioners of molecular gastronomy such as Heston Blumenthal of The Fat Duck restaurant first flash-freeze foie gras in liquid nitrogen as part of the preparation process.|$|E
25|$|But Mullan biographer Keith Peterson {{has argued}} that Mullan spent no time in Florida, or at most a few weeks. Peterson notes that Mullan {{remained}} in Louisiana with Company H until at least January 1856, when {{he was ordered to}} report to Company A at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. Mullan did not report to Company A until March 5, so it is possible that he spent part of January and February in Florida. But if so, there are no Army records of it and his time there would <b>be</b> <b>brief</b> at best. Mullan was detached from Company A in May and June 1856, but this would have left him almost no time to travel to and fight in Florida. He returned to Company A in early July 1856, and remained there until Company A was transferred to Fort Leavenworth in the Kansas Territory. He remained in Kansas until December 1857, when he was transferred to Washington, D.C., to work with Isaac Stevens again.|$|E

25|$|After {{their victory}} over a numerically much {{superior}} enemy, the Romans gained the upper hand. Reinforcements under Narses arrived, which enabled Belisarius to take several Gothic strongholds and control most of Italy {{south of the}} River Po {{by the end of}} 539. Eventually, Ravenna itself was taken by deceit in May 540, and the war seemed to be effectively over. However, very soon, the Goths, under the capable leadership of their new king Totila, managed to reverse the situation, until the Empire's position in Italy almost collapsed. In 546, Rome was again besieged by Totila, and this time Belisarius was unable to prevent its fall. The city was reoccupied by the Imperials soon after, and Totila had to besiege it again in 549. Despite the city's fall, Totila's triumph was to <b>be</b> <b>brief.</b> The arrival of Narses in 551 spelled {{the beginning of the end}} for the Goths, and in the Battle of Taginae in 552 the Goths were routed and Totila was killed. In 553 the last Ostrogothic king, Teia, was defeated. Although several cities in the north continued resistance up to the early 560s, Gothic power was broken for good.|$|E
25|$|Henry de Percy, who {{occupied}} the castle from 1308, had a bakehouse, brewhouse and kitchens {{built in the}} inner bailey. and the castle was once again made into a major fortification. Edward II (reigned 1307–1327) imprisoned some of his Scottish enemies there in 1311. In 1312 he gave Isabella de Vesci the castles of Bamburgh and Scarborough. The castle {{was considered to be}} the natural place for the king's favourite knight, the Gascon Piers Gaveston, to seek sanctuary when pursued by the barons who had imposed the Ordinances of 1311. The Ordinances were imposed to curb the King's power, and the barons saw Gaveston as a threat to their interests. Sir Robert Felton was governor of Scarborough Castle in 1311 and was slain at Stirling in 1314. In April 1312, Edward made Gaveston the governor of Scarborough Castle, but his tenure would <b>be</b> <b>brief.</b> In May, the Earls of Pembroke and Warenne, together with Henry de Percy, besieged and took the castle. Despite its strong defences, it fell quickly due to lack of provisions. Gaveston was promised safe escort from the castle, but on the journey south was captured by the Earl of Warwick and killed. Scarborough fared little better; Edward punished the town for not supporting Gaveston by revoking its royal privileges and placing it under the direct rule of appointed governors.|$|E
25|$|The peak of Australia's form {{proved to}} <b>be</b> <b>brief.</b> The team lost {{a number of}} players to early retirement, mainly because {{remuneration}} was so poor. Chappell was able to parlay his position into a reasonable income with his Queensland contract and personal endorsements, but he still needed to develop business interests in life insurance outside the game. His leadership abilities were tested {{in the summer of}} 1976–77 as a number of new players were blooded and Jeff Thomson was laid low by long-term injury. Australia received much criticism for defensive play during a drawn series with Pakistan, but Chappell's form was faultless, and he scored 121 and 67 in the only Test victory. The tour to New Zealand that followed was similar; it was clear Australia was in a rebuilding phase. During the Test at Auckland, a streaker appeared when Chappell was at the crease. Incensed by this new craze and the disruption that it caused, Chappell grabbed the man and hit his bare backside with the bat. When play resumed, the ensuing din from the incident caused Chappell to mis-hear his partner's call for a run, and he found himself run out. For once, the famous Chappell concentration had been broken. But the most significant occurrence of this match occurred off-field: Chappell was approached to sign with a proposed break away competition, later to be known as World Series Cricket (WSC).|$|E
