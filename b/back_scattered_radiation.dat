40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} which determines the aerosol light absorption from the simultaneous measurement of radiation passing through and scattered {{back from a}} particle-loaded fibre filter. The measurement is performed at three detection angles to resolve the influence of light scattering aerosol components on the angular distribution of the <b>back</b> <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation.</b> The fraction of light absorbed by the deposited aerosol (absorbance ABS) is obtained from a radiative transfer scheme. The method response normalised to the mass concentration of black carbon to test aerosols with mass fractions of the light-absorbing component between 1. 2 % and 100 % (aerosol single scattering albedo 1. 0 - 0. 28) varied by > 300 % for a transmission measurement only, but by < 50 % for multi-angle absorption photometry. The compensation of light scattering effects in filter-based aerosol absorption measurements is considerably improved. The detection limit is 3. 5 x 10 "-" 4 absorbance units. The uncertainty of the absorbance is #+-# 12 %. The evaluation of the method using field data yielded an average mass specific absorption coefficient of 9. 1 - 10. 7 m" 2 g"-" 1 at #lambda# = 0. 55 #mu#m for atmospheric black carbon in urban air.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} modelling of the polarized radiation transfer (RT) at the satellite remote sensing (SRS) of the strongly anisotropic cloudy atmosphere needs an efficient well-conditioned algorithm with accelerated solution convergence to be developed. The accelerated convergence {{can be achieved}} by the small angle approximation (SAA) subtracting from the general solution of the vectorial (polarization) RT equation (VRTE). The reminder, being a smooth function, is computed rapidly. In the current paper the SAA is determined in the frame of reference (FoR) containing the arbitrary directed sunlight rays. In contrast to the FoR containing the vertical direction of the slab the system for the coefficients of the radiation field with the coupled mutual azimuthally Fourierexpansion amplitudes is obtained. On the assumption of the continuous dependence of the angular generalized spherical function (GSF) expansion of the radiation field we use the Taylor series for the above mentioned coefficients with only two first terms left with respect to the strong anisotropy- the vectorial modified SAA of the spherical harmonics method (MSH). Some computational results are given in comparison with the single scattering approximation for thin slabs, the Monte-Carlo simulation for general case scattering and the total intensity of the polarized light beam is compared with the scalar spherical harmonics method (SHM). The algorithm for <b>back</b> <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation</b> computation for the SRS is given as well. 1...|$|E

SCIAMACHY onboard ENVISAT measures <b>back</b> <b>scattered</b> solar <b>radiation</b> at a spectral resolution (0. 2 to 1. 5 nm). The DOAS method {{was used for the}} first time to fit modelled Vibrational Raman Scattering (VRS) in liquid water and in situ measured phytoplankton absorption reference spectra to optical depths measured by SCIAMACHY. Spectral structures of VRS and phytoplankton absorption were clearly found in these optical depths. Both fitting approaches lead to consistent results. DOAS fits correlate with estimates of chlorophyll concentrations: low fit factors for VRS retrievals correspond to large chlorophyll concentrations and vice versa; large fit factors for phytoplankton absorption correspond with high chlorophyll concentrations and vice versa. From these results a simple retrieval technique taking advantage of both measurements is shown. First maps of global chlorophyll concentrations were compared to the corresponding MODIS measurements with very promising results. In addition, results from this study will be used to improve atmospheric trace gas DOAS-retrievals from visible wavelengths by including these oceanographic signatures...|$|R
40|$|The {{convergence}} of heat below subsidence inversions was estimated from radiosonde ascents on fine summer days. Sensible heat {{input from the}} ground was estimated from measurements of heat fluxes and net radiation over a wheat field. Absorption and <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> of solar <b>radiation</b> by aerosol throughout the atmosphere were calculated from measurements of solar radiation at the ground. Radiation absorbed by aerosol in the thermal boundary layer heated the lower atmosphere at an average rate of 3. 3 degC day-’ (60 Wrn-’), about {{twice as fast as}} estimated for gaseous constituents. An equation is derived to show how the net effect of aerosol on the lower atmosphere depends on the reflection coefficient of the surface and on the aerodynamic and surface resistances to vapour transfer. Over the wheat, the net effect was almost zero when the crop was transpiring fast, but when the crop was mature, aerosol caused net cooling. As part of a wider attempt to identify possible causes of climatic change, attention has recently been directed to the absorption and <b>scattering</b> of solar <b>radiation</b> by aerosol, processes which modify the heat balance of the atmosphere and the radiation budget at the earth’s surface.

Red sprites {{are associated with}} columns of ionization in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, from above the thunderstorm into the D region of the ionosphere. The ionized columns have been detected through “VLF sprites,” perturbations of the phase and/or amplitude of subionospheric VLF transmissions, {{which can be used}} to study the electrical properties of red sprites. There is extensive experimental evidence that VLF sprites may involve wide scattering angles and can produce <b>back</b> <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation.</b> Here we present a numerical and theoretical study of the scattering of subionospheric VLF transmissions caused by the plasma columns associated with red sprites. Comparison of the VLF scattering from sprites is made between a non-Born rigorous model which assumes the sprites are infinite columns of constant conductivity, and a three dimensional Born scattering code. Both formulations show excellent agreement with one another. The formulations predict VLF sprites similar to those experimentally observed for all scattering angles. This shows that the conclusions of previous studies into VLF sprites making use of the non-Born formulations of Rodger et al [1997 a, b] are valid. The modeling provides strong evidence that red sprite plasma is highly ionized in comparison with the ambient nighttime ionosphere, being nearly 5 orders of magnitude greater than the ambient at some height...|$|E

The advent of high power lasers operating in the oceanic transmission window of the visible spectrum (blue-green portion) has led to improved experimental illumination systems for underwater imaging The properties of laser bearm in range-gated and synchronously scanned devices {{take advantage of the}} unique temporal and spatial coherence effect of common volume back scatter to reduce or eliminate noise, increase signal to noise levels. Synchronously scanned systems rely on the highly collimated nature of the laser beam for spatial rejection of common volume back scatter. A synchronous, raster-scanning underwater laser imaging system (UWLIS) has been developed at Lawrence liver-more National Laboratory. The present UWLIS system differs from earlier synchronous scanners in its ability to scan in two dimensions at conventional video frame rate (30 Hz). The imaging performance of the present UWLIS was measured at distances of up to 6. 3 AL (at a physical distance of 15. 2 meters) during an in-water tank test and 4. 5 to 5. 0 AL (at a physical distance of 30 meters) during open water oceanic testing. The test results indicate that the UWLIS system is already capable of extending the underwater imaging range beyond that of conventional floodlight illuminated SIT cameras. The real or near real time frame rates of the UWLIS make possible operations in a mode in which the platform speed is randomly varied.

40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{choosing}} the appropriate site for a manned lunar base is the availability of resources, particularly oxygen and hydrogen {{for the production of}} water, and ores for the production of fuels and building materials. NASA has proposed two Lunar Scout missions that would orbit the Moon and use, among other instruments, a hard X-ray spectrometer, a neutron spectrometer, and a Ge gamma ray spectrometer to map the lunar surface. This passive instrumentation will have low resolution (tens of kilometers) due to the low signal levels produced by natural radioactivity and the interaction of cosmic rays and the solar wind with the lunar surface. This paper presents the results of a concept definition effort for a neutral particle beam lunar mapper probe. The idea of using particle beam probes to survey asteroids was first proposed by Sagdeev et al., and an ion beam device was fielded on the 1988 Soviet probe to the Mars moon Phobos. During the past five years, significant advances in the technology of neutral particle beams (NPB) have led to a suborbital flight of a neutral hydrogen beam device in the SDIO-sponsored BEAR experiment. An orbital experiment, the Neutral Particle Beam Far Field Optics Experiment (NPB-FOX) is presently in the preliminary design phase. The development of NPB accelerators that are space-operable leads one to consider the utility of these devices for probing the surface of the Moon using gamma ray, X-ray, and optical/UV spectroscopy to locate various elements and compounds. We consider the utility of the NPB-FOX satellite containing a 5 -MeV particle beam accelerator as a probe in lunar orbit. Irradiation of the lunar surface by the particle beam will induce secondary and <b>back</b> <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation</b> from the lunar surface to be detected by a sensor that may be co-orbital with or on the particle beam satellite platform, or may be in a separate orbit.

The fact that the probe could be placed in polar orbit would result in global coverage of the lunar surface.

The conversion of these differential absorptions by including the information of the light penetration depth (according to Vountas et al., Ocean Science, 2007) leads to globally distributed concentrations for these characteristic phytoplankton groups, but also for a well mixed phytoplankton assemblage (corresponding to ocean chl a). Phytoplankton concentrations have been determined for three monthly periods (Feb-March 2004, Oct-Nov 2005 and Oct-Nov 2007). The information retrieved by DOAS from SCIAMACHY on phytoplankton groups and chl a is compared to collocated in-situ measurements, MERIS data (chl a only) and to the global model analysis with the NASA Ocean Biogeochemical Model (NOBM from [URL] according to Gregg and Casey 2006 and Gregg 2006. Results are of great importance for global modelling of marine ecosystem and climate change studies regarding changes in the ocean. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|In this {{presentation}} we {{will discuss}} the techniques to estimate total column ozone and aerosol absorption optical depth from the measurements of <b>back</b> <b>scattered</b> ultraviolet (buv) <b>radiation.</b> The total ozone algorithm {{has been used to}} create a unique record of the ozone layer, spanning more than 3 decades, from a series of instruments (BUV, SBUV, TOMS, SBUV/ 2) flown on NASA, NOAA, Japanese and Russian satellites. We will discuss how this algorithm can be considered a generalization of the well-known Dobson/Brewer technique that has been used to process data from ground-based instruments for many decades, and how it differs from the DOAS techniques that have been used to estimate vertical column densities of a host of trace gases from data collected by GOME and SCIAMACHY instruments. The buv aerosol algorithm is most suitable for the detection of UV absorbing aerosols (smoke, desert dust, volcanic ash) and is the only technique that can detect aerosols embedded in clouds. This algorithm has been used to create a quarter century record of aerosol absorption optical depth using the buv data collected by a series of TOMS instruments. We will also discuss how the data from the OMI instrument launched on July 15, 2004 will be combined with data from MODIS and CALIPSO lidar data to enhance the accuracy and information content of satellite-derived aerosol measurements. The OMI and MODIS instruments are currently flying on EOS Aura and EOS Aqua satellites respectively, part of a constellation of satellites called the "A-train"...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} if 3  year treatment of hypercholesterolaemia with simvastatin causes {{an increase of}} lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b>  METHODS— 160 patients with hypercholesterolaemia in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4 S) were followed for 3  years. Half (80) of the patients took simvastatin and half (80) received placebo. The lens was photographed with a Topcon SL- 45 slit lamp camera {{at the beginning and}} at 1  year intervals. A common lens nuclear area was used for measuring lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b>  RESULTS—Nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> increased with age and there was more pronounced scattering in women than in men. Lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> did not differ significantly between the simvastatin and placebo groups, but the power was low (0. 2). Lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> increased during the study period independently of baseline <b>back</b> <b>scattering,</b> age, and sex for both groups.  CONCLUSION—Although no significant difference was found between the simvastatin and placebo groups, the currently available data are insufficient for exclusion of the possibility that taking simvastatin during a 3  year period increases nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b> However, a possible minor increase of nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> is clinically irrelevant considering known beneficial effects of simvastatin on coronary heart disease. ...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{tomography}} (X-ray scanner, Computed Tomography : CT, Single Photon Emission CT : SPECT, [...] .) {{is widely}} used in numerous fields such as medical imaging and non-destructive testing. In theses tomographies, a detector rotates in space to collect primary radiation emitted by an object under investigation. In this case Compton <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation</b> behaves as noise hindering image quality and consequently correction to scatter should be applied. However recently an interesting new imaging concept, which uses precisely <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation</b> as imaging agent, has been advocated. The camera records now images labeled by scattered photon energy or equivalently scattering angle. Then it is shown that the three dimensional image reconstruction from <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation</b> data is feasible [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In this work we propose {{a new form of}} Compton scattering tomography (CST), akin to the X-ray scanning tomography, {{in the sense that it}} works in transmission but uses Compton <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation.</b> The new image formation modeling is based on a new class of Radon transforms on circular arcs.

40|$|Abstract Background Fluoroscopic {{guidance}} {{is frequently}} utilized in interventional pain management. The major purpose of fluoroscopy is correct needle placement to ensure target specificity and accurate {{delivery of the}} injectate. Radiation exposure {{may be associated with}} risks to physician, patient and personnel. While there have been many studies evaluating the risk of radiation exposure and techniques to reduce this risk in {{the upper part of the}} body, the literature is scant in evaluating the risk of radiation exposure in the lower part of the body. Methods Radiation exposure risk to the physician was evaluated in 1156 patients undergoing interventional procedures under fluoroscopy by 3 physicians. Monitoring of <b>scattered</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure in the upper and lower body, inside and outside the lead apron was carried out. Results The average exposure per procedure was 12. 0 ± 9. 8 seconds, 9. 0 ± 0. 37 seconds, and 7. 5 ± 1. 27 seconds in Groups I, II, and III respectively. <b>Scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure ranged from a low of 3. 7 ± 0. 29 seconds for caudal/interlaminar epidurals to 61. 0 ± 9. 0 seconds for discography. Inside the apron, over the thyroid collar on the neck, the <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure was 68 mREM in Group I consisting of 201 patients who had a total of 330 procedures with an average of 0. 2060 mREM per procedure and 25 mREM in Group II consisting of 446 patients who had a total of 662 procedures with average of 0. 0378 mREM per procedure. The <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure was 0 mREM in Group III consisting of 509 patients who had a total 827 procedures. Increased levels of exposures were observed in Groups I and II compared to Group III, and Group I compared to Group II. Groin exposure showed 0 mREM exposure in Groups I and II and 15 mREM in Group III. <b>Scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure for groin outside the apron in Group I was 1260 mREM and per procedure was 3. 8182 mREM. In Group II the <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure was 400 mREM and with 0. 6042 mREM per procedure. In Group III the <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure was 1152 mREM with 1. 3930 mREM per procedure. Conclusion Results of this study showed that <b>scatter</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure to both the upper and lower parts of the physician's body is present. Protection was offered by traditional measures to the upper body only. </p...|$|R
