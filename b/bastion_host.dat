50|$|Guards are {{functionally}} {{equivalent to}} a <b>bastion</b> <b>host</b> acting as an application proxy placed within a DMZ network, where the proxy imposes the necessary controls over the data that is exchanged to provide the protection against external threats and internal leaks. But they can be distinguished {{by the way they}} are constructed. A DMZ network relies on the outer packet filtering firewalls to route traffic to the <b>bastion</b> <b>host.</b> If the firewalls function incorrectly they may pass traffic through the DMZ without passing through the <b>bastion</b> <b>host,</b> so the checks imposed by the proxies are bypassed. Also, if the networking stack of the <b>bastion</b> <b>host</b> behaves incorrectly it may route traffic through the DMZ without passing through the proxies.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two common}} network {{configurations}} that include <b>bastion</b> <b>hosts</b> and their placement. The first requires two firewalls, with <b>bastion</b> <b>hosts</b> sitting {{between the first}} [...] "outside world" [...] firewall, and an inside firewall, in a DMZ. Often smaller networks do not have multiple firewalls, so if only one firewall exists in a network, <b>bastion</b> <b>hosts</b> are commonly placed outside the firewall.|$|R
5000|$|The term is {{generally}} attributed to Marcus J. Ranum {{in an article}} discussing firewalls. In it he defines <b>bastion</b> <b>hosts</b> as ...a system identified by the firewall administrator as a critical strong point in the network security. Generally, <b>bastion</b> <b>hosts</b> will have some degree of extra attention paid to their security, may undergo regular audits, and may have modified software.|$|R

50|$|All {{three types}} of {{virtualization}} (hardware-based, software-based, and paravirtualization) have been implemented by a few projects, that run Linux, some being Linux-exclusive. The Linux kernel has been customized, adapted, and hardened to various scenarios, especially to the operation of a <b>bastion</b> <b>host.</b> Some were already mainlined, some are being developed and maintained out-of-tree.|$|E
50|$|Another {{deterrent}} {{is to use}} a bootable <b>bastion</b> <b>host</b> that executes a {{web browser}} in a known clean and secure operating environment. The host is devoid of any known malware, where data is never stored on the device, and the media cannot be overwritten. The kernel and programs are guaranteed to be clean at each boot. Some solutions have been used to create secure hardware browsers to protect users while accessing online banking.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bastion</b> <b>host</b> is {{a special}} purpose {{computer}} on a network specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks. The computer generally hosts a single application, for example a proxy server, and all other services are removed or limited to reduce {{the threat to the}} computer. It is hardened in this manner primarily due to its location and purpose, which is either on the outside of a firewall or in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) and usually involves access from untrusted networks or computers.|$|E
50|$|Dual-homed hosts {{can be seen}} as {{a special}} case of <b>bastion</b> <b>hosts</b> and multi-homed hosts. They fall into the {{category}} of application-based firewalls.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bastion</b> <b>hosts</b> {{are related}} to multi-homed hosts and {{screened}} hosts. While a dual-homed host often contains a firewall it {{is also used to}} host other services as well. A screened host is a dual-homed host that is dedicated to running the firewall. A bastion server can also be set up using ProxyCommand with OpenSSH.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a system}} {{identified}} by firewall administrator as critical strong point in network security.A <b>bastion</b> <b>host</b> is a computer that is fully exposed to attack. The system is on the public side of the DMZ, unprotected by a firewall or filtering router. Frequently the roles of these systems are critical to the network security system. Indeed, the firewalls and routers can be considered bastion hosts. Due to their exposure, {{a great deal of}} effort is made to minimize the chances of penetration. Other types of bastion hosts include web, mail, DNS, and FTP servers.|$|E

He left DEC to work for Trusted Information Systems (TIS) as chief scientist and development manager for Internet security products. It was at TIS that Ranum became responsible for the whitehouse.gov Internet email site. Once charged with that responsibility, Ranum advocated that the whitehouse.com domain be registered as well. [...] Despite his advice, it was not registered by the government, but was later registered for an adult entertainment provider. At TIS, he developed the TIS Internet Firewall Toolkit (fwtk) under a grant from DARPA. After TIS, he worked for V-One as chief scientist, and was extensively involved in that company's IPO. Three months after that IPO, Ranum formed his own company, Network Flight Recorder (NFR), and served as CEO for three years before stepping into a CTO role. [...] Ranum later left NFR to consult for TruSecure, before joining Tenable Network Security as CSO.|$|E

5000|$|A {{firewall}} must restrict {{access to}} the internal network but allow external access to services offered to the public, such as web servers on the internal network. This is usually accomplished by creating a separate internal network called a DMZ, a play on the term “demilitarized zone." [...] External devices are allowed to access devices in the DMZ. Devices in the DMZ are usually maintained more carefully to reduce their vulnerability to malware. Hardened devices are sometimes called <b>bastion</b> <b>hosts.</b>|$|R

30|$|Distributed firewalling has not {{received}} much attention in the literature, but an initial model has been proposed by Bellovin et al. in [5], where the firewall was moved from a <b>bastion</b> <b>host</b> to endpoints in a traditional architecture network. Recently, the subject has been investigated with more attention. Bellovin again, followed by other authors, proposed a distributed policy enforcement platform [6 – 10]. These works are not focused on the complexity introduced by large rule-sets. Other works focus on the application of hash functions to speed up rule matching [11 – 13] or on limiting the nodes that enforce the firewall [14]. None of these works focus on techniques to reduce the rule-sets on single nodes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Firewall Policy Anomalies are {{situations}} where pre-defined and applied policy settings fail to impose during packet filtrations due to heavy loads {{experienced by the}} firewall. Prior approaches to handle these anomalies suffered from rule mismanagement and inaccurate results issues. So, we have used the earlier development of anomaly management framework for firewalls based on a rule-based segmentation technique that facilitates not just accurate anomaly detection but also effective anomaly resolution. A grid based visualization technique is introduced to represent policy anomaly diagnosis information in an intuitive and effective way. As a performance optimization parameter {{we would like to}} extend the anomaly management framework with access control policies(ACP). This kind of ACP based approach to the proposed framework turns a security implementation device such as a firewall into a <b>bastion</b> <b>host</b> like machine leading to better management of the host and a practical implementation validates our claim...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In management-type SaaS, user must be {{permitted}} to submit tenant’s business data on the SP's server, which may be embedded by the web-based malware. In this paper, we propose the automatic detecting method of web-based malware based on behavior analysis, which can make sure to meet the SLA by detecting the web-based malware actively. First, tenant’s update is downloaded to the <b>bastion</b> <b>host</b> by the web crawler. Second, it detect the behavior that tenant’s update is opened by IE. In order to break the malicious behavior during detecting, the IE has been injected in the DLL. Last, if the sensitive operations happen, the URL is appended to the malicious address database, and at same time the system administrator is informed by the SMS. The result of test is shown that our method can detect the web-based malware accurately. It helps to improve the service level of the management-type SaaS...|$|E
40|$|Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular {{computing}} tools nowadays. Compared with desktop and notebook computers, PDAs are smaller, lighter and can be carried everywhere. However, PDAs have several limitations. They use smaller microprocessors which are much slower than their PC counterparts. Their lack of computational power makes it very difficult to perform some heavy computations, such as generating RSA keys, which needs large prime numbers. Thus, it is useful to have a combination of a PC and a PDA, where the PC performs heavy computations to assist the PDA. This scenario is feasible as long as we assure that the PC will not learn the secret of the PDA. We propose two schemes, which involve some server-aided computations, where the server will not learn the PDAs secret from the interaction. This thesis also investigates the security of PDAs when they are used to perform some cryptographic applications. Due to the limited computational power of PDAs, such computations require some amount of time (and battery life). We show that by observing one of the parameters, we can reduce the hard problem being predictable. We also propose how to securely generate these kinds of computations in PDAs by using some different techniques, so that it will not reveal any additional information to a passive eavesdropper. In addition, along with their popularity, handheld devices are starting to become the target for attackers, who are mainly interested in gaining the data stored in handheld devices. In this thesis, we review the security threats to handheld computers and propose two possible solutions. The first solution is to use a desktop computer to act as a <b>bastion</b> <b>host</b> to protect the handheld computer. The second proposed solution is to build a personal firewall for handheld computers. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|The {{configuration}} and maintainance of DNS zones offer many {{degrees of}} freedom and thus several opportunities for making mistakes. Most DNS zones today are small {{and have to be}} set up and maintained by non-experts. This document gives recommendations on which values to use for the SOA resource record of small, stable DNS zones to aid novice administrators and to contribute to DNS stability end efficiency. 1. Conventions used in this document Domain names used in this document are for explanatory purposes only and should not be expected to lead to useful information in real life [RFC 2606]. 2. Background Various DNS surveying activities show {{that the vast majority of}} today's DNS zones are populated by very few hosts. In most cases there is only an HTTP server announced under the common name "www", sometimes accompanied by distinct mail or DNS servers or a <b>bastion</b> <b>host.</b> For many of these zones the configuration is touched once when it is set up and then left alone without modification for a long time. These recommendations are aimed at small and stable DNS zones. There are many legitimate reasons to use different values, e. g. proposed changes or special purpose applications. Administrators of those zones should consult one of the various more detailed DNS guidelines or books. Several other recommendations for SOA values exist [RFC 1535, RFC 1912], which are not obsoleted by this document but which have a different focus. At the time of their writing DNS zones were usually more densely populated and their target audience was supposed to have more interest in DNS. ISPs and DNS server vendors are encouraged to use this information for their customers, in configuration tools or as default values. Additional hints for initial name server setup and configuration of this type of zone can be found in [DNSGUIDE 1], [DNSGUIDE 2]...|$|E
