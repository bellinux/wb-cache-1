This paper deals with the study of the mass transfer mechanisms involved in such electroseparation processes. On one hand, a theoretical approach is carried out. The different contributions to the mass transfer are considered in order to establish a relationship providing the solute concentration as function of the main parameters of the system, i. e. the operating conditions and the membrane, buffer and solute characteristics. In this expression, a partition coefficient is used to represent the interactions taking place at the membrane–solution interface. Then, an experimental study is performed with different representative solutes using a prototype apparatus {{in order to determine the}} dependence of the solvent and solute transfer with respect to the operating and physicochemical parameters of the system. The experimental results show the existence of a limiting electro-osmotic flux, the origin of which is explained. Then the partition coefficient is determined for any set of conditions by fitting the variations of the solute concentration calculated by the model with experimental ones. The dependence of the partition coefficient with respect to the solute and <b>buffer</b> <b>characteristics,</b> together with that of the transmission coefficient obtained during filtration experiments, shows that the main limitation with respect to the mass transfer is due to electrostatic interactions taking place at the membrane–solution interface. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|In many cell types, {{release of}} calcium ions is {{controlled}} by inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate () receptor channels. Elevations in concentration after intracellular release through receptors (R) can either propagate {{in the form of}} waves spreading through the entire cell or produce spatially localized puffs. The appearance of waves and puffs is thought to implicate random initial openings of one or a few channels and subsequent activation of neighboring channels because of an “autocatalytic” feedback. It is much less clear, however, what determines the further time course of release, particularly since the lifetime is very different for waves (several seconds) and puffs (around 100 ms). Here we study the lifetime of signals and their dependence on residual microdomains. Our general idea is that microdomains are dynamical and mediate the effect of other physiological processes. Specifically, we focus on the mechanism by which binding proteins (buffers) alter the lifetime of signals. We use stochastic simulations of channel gating coupled to a coarse-grained description for the concentration. To describe the concentration in a phenomenological way, we here introduce a differential equation, which reflects the <b>buffer</b> <b>characteristics</b> by a few effective parameters. This non-stationary model for microdomains gives deep insight into the dynamical differences between puffs and waves. It provides a novel explanation for the different lifetimes of puffs and waves and suggests that puffs are terminated by inhibition while unbinding is responsible for termination of waves. Thus our analysis hints at an additional role of and shows how cells can make use of the full complexity in R gating behavior to achieve different signals...|$|E
40|$|Agriculture is {{currently}} {{the leading cause of}} stream impairment in the United States. As the population continues to grow as well as the demand for biofuels, more pressure is being exerted on land to produce greater quantities of food. To satisfy the need for increased production marginal forest and grasslands have been converted to agriculture, fertilizers and equipment have rapidly evolved, and land has been taken out of conservation programs. Unfortunately, water quality impairment often accompanies these efforts to increase crop production. To reduce the impacts of agriculture on water quality, best management practices (BMPs) have been developed and tested at the field scale, with fewer studies focusing on the effects of agricultural land cover and BMPs (e. g., riparian buffers) on water quality at the watershed scale. Thus, a study was designed to assess the effects of riparian buffers and agricultural land cover on water quality at the watershed scale. Within Richland and Silver Creek watersheds, tributaries of the Lower Kaskaskia River Watershed in Illinois, forty-three catchments ranging from 12 to 50 km 2 were selected across an agricultural to urban land cover gradient. Between January 18, 2008 and August 3, 2009, grab samples were collected twice a month during the wet portion of the year and once a month during the dry portion of the year and analyzed for nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, and orthophosphate), bacteria (total coliform, fecal coliform, and E. coli), and total suspended solids (TSS). Correlation analyses were performed on the data to determine relationships between the water quality variables, whole-catchment land cover (agriculture, forest, and urban), and percent forest canopy cover within 50 m of the stream using two different stream layers (National Hydrologic Dataset (NHD), and Flow Accumulation Boundaries (FAB)). Also, riparian <b>buffer</b> <b>characteristics</b> were quantified in headwater streams to determine if they were more highly correlated with water quality variables than in larger order streams. The percent of agricultural land cover within a watershed was significantly correlated with TSS (r = 0. 4556, p = 0. 0021) and ammonium-N (r = 0. 3043, p = 0. 0473) during baseflow, and TSS (r = 0. 2837, p = 0. 0652), ammonium-N (r = 0. 5306, p = 0. 0003), nitrate-N (r = 0. 2654, p = 0. 0854), and orthophosphate (r = 0. 3783, p = 0. 0124) during stormflow. Total amount of enrolled Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land within Richland Creek and Silver Creek watersheds were found not to be correlated with water quality. A possible reason for these results could be because only a very small percent of lands in Richland Creek and Silver Creek were enrolled in CRP. Whole-catchment land cover in most cases explained more variance than percent forest canopy cover within 50 m of streams for the water quality parameters analyzed. There were only slight differences between the two stream layers (NHD and FAB). However, the headwater streams of the FAB stream layer explained more variance in critical water quality parameters, ammonium-N (r = - 0. 5309, p = 0. 002) during baseflow and ammonium-N (r = - 0. 6107 p 3 ̆c 0. 0001), and orthophosphate (r = - 0. 5273 p = 0. 0003) during stormflow. Having an understanding of the impacts that riparian buffers and headwater streams have on water quality is key for watershed managers to focus restoration efforts in the most critical areas for maintaining stream quality...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{gives the}} review {{on the role}} of calcium in many {{physiological}} processes of plant organisms, including growth and development, protection from pathogenic influences, response to changing environmental factors, and many other aspects of plant physiology. Initial intake of calcium ions is carried out by Ca 2 +-channels of plasma membrane and they are further transported by the xylem owing to auxins’ attractive ability. The level of intake and selectivity of calcium transport to ove-ground parts of the plant is controlled by a symplast. Ca 2 +enters to the cytoplasm of endoderm cells through calcium channels on the cortical side of Kaspary bands, and is redistributed inside the stele by the symplast, with the use of Ca 2 +-АТPases and Ca 2 +/Н+-antiports. Owing to regulated expression and activity of these calcium transporters, calclum can be selectively delivered to the xylem. Important role in supporting calcium homeostasis is given to the vacuole which is the largest depo of calcium. Regulated quantity of calcium movement through the tonoplast is provided by a number of potential-, ligand-gated active transporters and channels, like Ca 2 +-ATPase and Ca 2 +/H+ exchanger. They are actively involved in the inactivation of the calcium signal by pumping Ca 2 + to the depo of cells. Calcium ATPases are high affinity pumps that efficiently transfer calcium ions against the concentration gradient in their presence in the solution in nanomolar concentrations. Calcium exchangers are low affinity, high capacity Ca 2 + transporters that are effectively transporting calcium after raising its concentration in the cell cytosol through the use of protons gradients. Maintaining constant concentration and participation in the response to stimuli of different types also involves EPR, plastids, mitochondria, and cell wall. Calcium binding proteins contain several conserved sequences that provide sensitivity to changes in the concentration of Ca 2 + and when you connect ion conformationally rearranged, thus passing the signal through the chain of intermediaries. The most important function of calcium is its participation in many cell signaling pathways. Channels, pumps, gene expression, synthesis of alkaloids, protective molecules, NO etc. respond to changes in [Ca 2 +]cyt, while transductors are represented by a number of proteins. The universality of calcium is evident in the study in connection with other signaling systems, such as NO, which is involved in the immune response and is able to control the feedback activity of protein activators channels, producing nitric oxide. Simulation of calcium responses can determine the impact of key level and their regulation, and also depends on the type of stimulus and the effector protein that specifically causes certain changes. Using spatiotemporal modeling, scientists showed that the key components for the formation of Ca 2 + bursts are the internal and external surfaces of the nucleus membrane. The research was aimed at understanding of the mechanisms of influence of Ca 2 +-binding components on Ca 2 + oscillations. The simulation suggests the existence of a calcium depot EPR with conjugated lumen of the nucleus which releases its contents to nucleoplasm. With these assumptions, the mathematical model was created and confirmed experimentally. It describes the oscillation of nuclear calcium in root hairs of Medicago truncatula at symbiotic relationship of plants and fungi (rhizobia). Calcium oscillations are present in symbiotic relationships of the cortical layer of plant root cells. Before penetration of bacteria into the cells, slow oscillations of Ca 2 + are observed, but with their penetration into the cells the oscillation frequency increases. These processes take place by changing <b>buffer</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the cytoplasm caused by signals from microbes, such as Nod-factor available after penetration of bacteria through the cell wall. Thus, the basic known molecular mechanisms for regulation of calcium homeostasis in plant cells are reviewed. Data presented in the paper is important for understanding the role of calcium in the ions’ homeostasis and can be used for developing high-performance technologies of crops nutrition...|$|E

The probe is based on the reflection of sound at the probe's interface with the fluid. The amplitude of the echo from that interface indicates the characteristic acoustic impedance of the liquid. The liquid's density is the ratio of its acoustic impedance to the speed of sound through it. The latter is obtained by measuring the time necessary for the transmitted sound pulse to be echoed back from a reflector located at a known distance in the fluid. The probe consists of two buffer rods in series behind which sits a transducer. This arrangement removes any dependence on the amplitude of the initial pulse.

40|$|A {{series of}} analogues of Schiff-base {{containing}} the ONNNO donor atom set were synthesized deriving from {{the reaction of}} salicylaldehyde and the triamine compounds of diethylenetriamine, diproplylenetriamine, and ethylene propylenetriamine, and the correspondent triamine compounds but bearing with middle N-bonded pyridinyl. Complexations were made at ambient temperature by reaction of the ligands with 99 m Tc-pertechnatate {{in the presence of}} stannous tartrate solution under different pH <b>buffers.</b> The radiochemical <b>characteristics</b> of the 99 mTc-labeled complexes with the various ligands were investigated by the techniques of solvent extraction, thin layer chromatography and paper electrophoresis. Biodistribution of four 99 m Tc labeled complexes were studied on C 3 H/HeN mice. Correlation of biodistribution with radiochemical characteristics for the 99 m Tc labeled complexes is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} and cooling of noble gas singly-charged ion beams {{by means of}} a Radio Frequency Quadrupole Cooler Buncher (RFQCB) have been studied at the LIMBE low energy beam line of the GANIL facility. Ions as light as $^{ 4 }He^+$ have been cooled and stored before their extraction in bunches using $H_ 2 $ as <b>buffer</b> gas. Bunches <b>characteristics</b> have been studied {{as a function of the}} parameters of the device. Sizeable transmissions of up to 10 $% $ have been obtained. A detailed study of the lifetime of ions inside the buncher has been performed giving an estimate of the charge exchange cross-section. Results of a microscopic Monte-Carlo transport code show reasonable agreement with experimental data. Comment: 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|Electroosmotic flow {{velocity}} measurements {{in a square}} microchannel Abstract Experiments were per-formed using a microparticle image velocimetry (MPIV) for 2 D velocity distributions of electroosmotically driven flows in a 40 -mm-long micro-channel with a square cross section of 200 × 200 μm. Electroosmotic flow (EOF) bulk fluid velocity measure-ments were made {{in a range of}} streamwise electric field strengths from 5 to 25 kV/m. A series of seed particle calibration tests can be made in a 200 × 120 × 24, 000 -μm untreated polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS chan-nel incorporating MPIV to determine the electrophoretic mobilities in aqueous buffer solutions of 1 × TAE, 1 × TBE, 10 mM NaCl, and 10 mM borate. A linear/nonlinear (due to Joule heating) flow rate increase with applied field was obtained and com-pared with those of previous studies. A parametric study, with extensive measurements, was performed with different electric field strength and buffer solution concentration under a constant zeta potential at wall for each <b>buffer.</b> The <b>characteristics</b> of EOF in square microchannels were thus investigated. Finally, a composite correlation of the relevant parameters was developed in the form of u 5 : 46 ς 0 : 739 DN 2 : 132 ME 0 : 9996 x within ± 1 % accuracy for 99 % of the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Graphene {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{material}} due to its promising properties, for instance electronics applications. Graphene films were grown on silicon carbide (SiC) substrate using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Influence of the deposition temperature on the morphology of the films was investigated. Characterizations were done by reflectance mapping, atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Two samples were done by sublimation process, to compare the number of layers and the morphology of the graphene films with the one grown by chemical vapor deposition. The reflectance mapping showed that the number of layers on the samples made by CVD was notinfluenced by the deposition temperature. But also, demonstrated that sublimation growth is present in allthe samples due to the presence of silicon coating in the susceptor. The growth probably started by sublimation and then CVD deposition. The step morphology characteristic of the silicon carbide substrate surface was conserved during the deposition of graphene. But due to surface step bunching, a decrease inthe step height occurred and the width of the terraces increased. The decreasing in deposition temperature leads to a smoother surface with the CVD method. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence ofgraphene and of the <b>buffer</b> layer <b>characteristic</b> of the sublimation growth. Moreover, it demonstrated the presence of compressive strain in the graphene layers...|$|R
