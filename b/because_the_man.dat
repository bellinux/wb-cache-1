25|$|In 2001, New York Supreme Court Justice Gerald Garson was applauded by feminists for {{ordering}} an Orthodox Jewish man to pay {{his wife}} $500 a week for life, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> refused to grant her a get. Many Orthodox rabbis have spoken out against the validity of gets obtained through civil courts. Garson was convicted in 2007 of accepting bribes to manipulate the outcomes of divorce proceedings, and was imprisoned from June 2007 until December 2009.|$|E
25|$|Leonardo's face is {{best known}} from a drawing in red chalk {{that appears to be}} a self-portrait. However, there is some {{controversy}} over the identity of the subject, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> represented appears to be of a greater age than the 67 years lived by Leonardo. A solution which has been put forward is that Leonardo deliberately aged himself in the drawing, as a modern forensic artist might do, in order to provide a model for Raphael's painting of him as Plato in The School of Athens.|$|E
25|$|Christine El Mahdy, an Egyptologist, {{argues that}} Tutankhamun {{died of natural}} causes, which she {{believes}} was most likely a tumor of some sort. She uses the original assumption from Carter's examination that Tutankhamun had a quick burial ceremony since some elements of the mummification appeared rushed, as proof {{that he needed to}} be buried quickly following his unexpected death <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who was next in line for the throne wanted to avoid a power struggle that might have occurred if the burial process had taken too long. By speeding up the burial ceremony, the new pharaoh maintained order in Egypt.|$|E
60|$|And why is this? <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> {{who wrote}} these Psalms had faith in God.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, late {{at night}} on Tuesday, May 7, a 45-year-old black man named Herbert Thomas was flagged down by a {{hitchhiker}} in Kilgore. The man said that he needed a ride to Henderson because his mother was seriously ill and offered $5. Thomas {{said that he would}} not have given the man a ride but felt like he needed to <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> told such a sad story. When they neared Henderson, the man pulled out a pistol and told Thomas to keep driving or he would kill him like the five people he killed in Texarkana, mentioning Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker by name. The man told Thomas that he was not done killing and was planning on killing more. He {{said he was going to}} return to Texarkana and kill Martin's father. The suspect apparently did not know that Martin's father was already dead. The man then made Thomas stop in Lufkin and told him to drive back to Kilgore and that if he followed him, he would trail him and kill him. The man stole back the $5 as well as an additional $3. Thomas drove back to Kilgore and reported the incident to the police. Thomas described the man as being 5'8, about 130pounds, approximately 27 or 28 years old, with red hair and wore khaki trousers and a GI jacket.|$|E

Eventually they become friendlier, but then Naru confesses her feelings to Kobayashi, though she knows he is gay. He gently rejects her, and despite Kobayashi's worries, Toyo does not get mad at him. Their friendship continues deepening, and Toyo realizes that Kobayashi is always watching him. After confirming with Naru that Kobayashi is gay, Toyo confronts him and Kobayashi confirms {{that he is in}} love with him. Due to an incident in his past, Toyo initially rejects his feelings, but one night during a storm Kobayashi is hurt protecting Toyo and they go back to Kobayashi's house to treat the wound. Toyo tells him about a man he was in love with, but rejected publicly out of fear of his friend's reactions and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> was moving away. Toyo finally accepts Kobayashi's feelings. They initially keep their relationship secret from Naru, afraid of hurting her, but she quickly realizes what is going on. She yells at Kobayashi for lying because {{they are supposed to be}} friends, then tells him she is okay with their relationship. After they part ways, she walks along crying and runs into Ida, who comforts her.|$|E

I say that when the government drafts a man from civil life and puts him in the military service ... and, thereafter, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> does not show sufficient aptitude gives him a blue discharge, or a discharge without honor, that fact should not be permitted to prevent the man from receiving the benefits to which soldiers are generally entitled." ...|$|E

Returning to his car, Greene is stopped {{a small group of}} young boys riding bikes. In a gesture of admiration to the spunkiest of them, he gives the boy a necklace with a meaningful history to him. He notices Ferritto driving by slowly, and accepts that he is about to die, [...] Ferritto detonates a bomb on the car next to Greene's, killing Greene instantly. An epilogue, by Manditski, reveals that the investigation of Danny Greene's murder led to the collapse of the Mafia, not only in Cleveland, but all over the United States.|$|E
2500|$|John Leonard, {{writing in}} The New York Times, praised Time Enough for Love as [...] "a great entertainment," [...] declaring that [...] "it doesn't matter [...] all his {{characters}} sound and behave exactly the same; it's <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{is a master}} of beguilement.

'He can be pleasant.' 'He's nice and very competent.' Only one lawyer criticized , saying, ' tough, and can be aggressive and impatient.' Garson also received good ratings for his legal knowledge, administration of his courtroom, and handling of trials and settlements. He was rated [...] "approved" [...] by the local bar association. In 2001, he was applauded by feminists for ordering an Orthodox Jewish man to pay his ex-wife $500-a-week for life, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> refused to grant her a religious divorce, or get.|$|E

50|$|Several philologists {{think the}} term montonera {{is derived from}} montón (crowd), <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> marched in a disorderly fashion; others think it derives from montes (mountains), as <b>the</b> <b>men</b> used <b>the</b> backcountry as their {{defensive}} bases.

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob named the place Peniel, {{saying that he}} had seen God face to face and lived. And at sunrise, Jacob limped from the injury to his thigh. Because of this, the Israelites do not eat the sinew of the vein that is the hollow of the thigh, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh. When Jacob saw Esau coming with 400 men, he divided his family, putting the handmaids and their {{children}} foremost, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph at the back. Jacob went before them, and bowed to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, and kissed him, and they wept. Esau asked who the women and children were. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a concert}} in October 2002, at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, someone in the {{audience}} yelled out a request for [...] "Summer of '69," [...] a hit by the similarly-named Bryan Adams. Ryan reacted with a stream of expletives, and ordered the house lights turned on, The Tennessean newspaper reported. He eventually found the fan who made the joke request, paid him $30 cash as a refund for the show, ordered him to leave, {{and said he would}} not play another note until he had left. In a 2014 interview, Ryan Adams denied that the audience member was asked to leave [...] "for screaming a Bryan Adams song", but rather <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> was drunk: [...] "The reason why the guy ever was asked to leave by me was because I was doing an a capella three-piece with Gillian Welch, David Rawlings, and myself of ‘Bartering Lines,’ and in between the quiet parts the guy was screaming." [...] In April 2015, Ryan, who had since become friends with Bryan, played [...] "Summer of '69" [...] at the end of another performance at the Ryman, an act described by Rolling Stone as [...] "an olive branch to the city that was once his home." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1912, Cobb {{assaulted}} a heckler, Claude Lucker (often misspelled as Lueker), in {{the stands}} in New York's Hilltop Park where his Tigers were playing the Highlanders (now the Yankees). Lucker and Cobb had traded insults with {{each other through the}} first couple of innings. Cobb at one point went to the Highlander dugout to look for the Highlander's owner to try to have Lucker ejected from the game, but his search was in vain. The situation finally climaxed when Lucker allegedly called Cobb a [...] "half-nigger." [...] Cobb, in his discussion of the incident in the Holmes biography, avoided such explicit words but alluded to Lucker's epithet by saying he was [...] "reflecting on my mother's color and morals." [...] He went on to state that he warned Highlander manager Harry Wolverton that if something wasn't done about that man, there would be trouble. No action was taken. At the end of the sixth inning, after being challenged by teammates Sam Crawford and Jim Delahanty to do something about it, Cobb climbed into the stands and attacked Lucker, who it turned out was handicapped (he had lost all of one hand and three fingers on his other hand in an industrial accident). When onlookers shouted at him to stop <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> had no hands, he reportedly retorted, [...] "I don't care if he got no feet!" [...] Though such an incident seems outrageous in the 21st century, attacking fans was not so unusual an activity {{in the early years of}} baseball. Other notable baseball stars who assaulted heckling fans include Babe Ruth, Cy Young, Rube Waddell, Kid Gleason, Sherry Magee, and Fred Clarke.|$|E

5000|$|There {{have been}} anecdotes of men wearing pantyhose for {{practical}} purposes nearly since their original introduction in the women's market, but these {{stories have been}} typically difficult to verify <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> in question tended to refrain from discussing the issue.
