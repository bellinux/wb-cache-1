Aged six, she was taken to swimming classes while the family holidayed in the Mornington Peninsula. Leech was coached by Gus Froelich, a former European swimming champion and coach of Australian Olympic medallist Judy-Joy Davies.|$|E
5|$|This {{fighting}} was so heavy that the NK 8th Division {{was forced to}} hold its ground a week <b>before</b> <b>trying</b> to advance. When it finally broke out, it was only able to advance briefly before it was stalled again by South Korean resistance. The division was forced to halt a second time to wait for reinforcements. However the other two attacks were more successful, catching the UN forces by surprise. The North Koreans quickly pushed South Korean forces back.|$|E

The NK 8th Division drove for Yongch'on from Uiseong, but its attack failed to reach the Taegu-P'ohang corridor after being surprised and outflanked by the ROK 8th Division.

60|$|Little {{more than}} a week after, on the seventh of April, the great Piazza della Signoria {{presented}} a stranger spectacle even than the famous Bonfire of Vanities.

5|$|Their {{first two}} days at sea are {{unproductive}} and they return to port each night. On the third day, Hooper wants to bring along a shark proof cage. Initially Quint refuses, considering it a suicidal idea, but he relents when Hooper offers him a hundred dollars. On the ocean, the shark finally shows up. Hooper guesses the animal {{must be at least}} twenty feet long, and is visibly excited and in awe. After several unsuccessful attempts by Quint to harpoon the shark, Hooper goes underwater in the cage. He resolves to first take photos of the shark, <b>before</b> <b>trying</b> to kill it with a bang stick. However, the shark attacks the cage, and, after ramming the bars apart, kills and eats Hooper.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the fourth day, England set about extending their lead. Early in the innings, the capacity crowd encroached substantially onto the ground and the umpires spent eight minutes trying to force them back {{to the edge of the}} official playing area, but they again spilled over. Initially, Hutton and Washbrook played cautiously to see off the new ball <b>before</b> <b>trying</b> to lift the run rate. Lindwall's first two overs were maidens, but Hutton and Washbrook scored 21 runs from his next five overs, while taking only five from Miller's six overs. The English batsmen attacked the bowling and reinforced their aggressive strokeplay with quick running. England reached lunch at 72/0 with Hutton on 40 and Washbrook on 28. Washbrook was particularly confident and Bradman decided to not risk Johnson in the morning session.|$|E

25|$|Liberace mostly {{bypassed}} radio <b>before</b> <b>trying</b> {{a television}} career, thinking radio unsuitable given his act's dependency on the visual. Despite his enthusiasm {{about the possibilities}} of television, Liberace was disappointed after his early guest appearances on CBS's The Kate Smith Show, and DuMont's Cavalcade of Stars, with Jackie Gleason (later The Jackie Gleason Show on CBS). Liberace was particularly displeased with the frenetic camera work and his short appearance time. He soon wanted his own show where he could control his presentation {{as he did with}} his club shows.|$|E

When White went ashore to supervise attempts to pull her off, a party of Dutchmen from a schuyt landed and captured him. Manlys master, William Golding, decided to surrender her. Dutch gun-boats then captured her. The subsequent court martial stripped Golding of his rank for conduct unbecoming an officer and ordered him to serve a two-year term as a seaman. The board also reprimanded White for not having lightened Manly <b>before</b> <b>trying</b> to pull her off.|$|E
25|$|The cue {{familiarity}} {{hypothesis was}} proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing {{a pair of}} experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability {{to answer a question}} <b>before</b> <b>trying</b> to answer it. This finding suggests that the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgements regarding metamemory are based on an individual’s level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual is more likely to judge that they know the answer to a question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not know the answer to a question which presents new or unfamiliar terms.|$|E

At 70/4 Misbah came in and blitzed the South African bowling attack with a 197 run stand with the Asad Shafiq repeating the same stand the two had in the first test, Misbah scored 88 <b>before</b> <b>trying</b> to obliterate the part-time spinner Dean Elgar over cow corner but edged it straight to Jacques Kallis.

While the group heads for the station, Eben creates a diversion by having the vampires chase him to his grandmother's house, where he uses one of her ultraviolet lights to burn the face of Marlow's lover, Iris (Megan Franich), so badly that Marlow is forced to kill her. As he escapes, the town snow plow operator, Beau (Mark Boone Junior), creates another distraction with his tractor, killing many of the vampires, <b>before</b> <b>trying</b> to blow himself up; when he fails, Marlow crushes his head. Eben arrives at the station, where he is then forced to kill Carter (Nathaniel Lees), who has been bitten and is turning into a vampire.|$|E
25|$|The ship came adrift on 22October and {{the party}} spent three days recapturing her. She was {{evacuated}} on 12November due to crushing by ice, but it was deemed safe for the crew to return until 21December when the vessel was crushed beyond repair. On 22January 1904 the ship disappeared, either sinking or drifting away during night. The first attempt to reach the pole began on 7March with 26 men and Fiala acting as cook. Bad weather forced them {{to return to the}} base camp on 11March. A new attempt made on 25March lasted only two days before the expedition was forced to wait until the next spring <b>before</b> <b>trying</b> again. The men retreated to Cape Flora, although all but fourteen of them instead stopped at Camp Abruzzi. On 30April the most enthusiastic men continued towards Cape Flora, which they reached on 16May, the same day as one of the Norwegians died.
