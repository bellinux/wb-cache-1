25|$|As fired <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> is {{a mixture}} of organics, inorganics and water. Typically the amount of water is {{expressed}} as mass ratio of dried <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> to unit of <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> before drying.

25|$|If the <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> {{dry solids}} is below 20% or water content in <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> is above 80% the net heating value of <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> is negative. This {{means that all}} heat from {{combustion}} of organics in <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> is spent evaporating the water it contains.

40|$|Sulfur-free pulping has an {{environmental}} {{advantage over the}} traditional kraft process. This article describes the combustion properties of the <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> produced from silver birch (Betula pendula) sawdust using three different cooking processes: two sulfur-free cooks (soda-anthraquinone and oxygen-alkali), and one reference kraft cook. It also considers the corresponding <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> from an integrated forest biorefinery, in which a hot-water pretreatment of feedstock was performed prior to pulping. With the same cooking time, the total burning times for the sulfur-free <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> were higher (15 – 55 %) than those for the conventional kraft <b>black</b> <b>liquors.</b> However, {{no significant differences were}} noted between the total burning times for <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> from pretreated feedstock and those from untreated feedstock. Especially in the case of untreated feedstock, the results showed that the kraft <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> typically swelled more (25 – 45 %) than the sulfur-free <b>black</b> <b>liquors.</b> It was further observed that the kraft and soda-anthraquinone <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> from the untreated feedstock swelled more than those from the pretreated feedstock, while the oxygen-alkali <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> swelled less...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the combustion behavior of birch and spruce kraft <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> obtained from an integrated forest biorefinery concept {{in which a}} hot water extraction of chips was performed before pulping. This pretreatment, aiming mainly at the recovery of various hemicellulose-derived materials, increased the concentrations of lignin and hydroxy acids in <b>black</b> <b>liquors,</b> compared {{with those in the}} reference <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> without any process modification. On the other hand, the pretreatment decreased the concentrations of volatile acids and other organics (extractives and hemicellulose residues). Because of these characteristic changes, the total burning times (pyrolysis time plus char burning time) of the reference <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> were somewhat longer than those of <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> from the modified cooking process. The novel biorefinery-based <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> also swell more than the conventional ones. This phenomenon was primarily associated with the combined effect of high-molar-mass lignin fragments and hydroxy acids. All of the detected changes in combustion behavior were more intense for birch <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> than for spruce <b>black</b> <b>liquors...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} dry solids concentration {{has had a}} significant effect on the main operating variables. The steam flow increases with increasing <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> dry solids content. Increasing closure of the pulp mill means that less heat per unit of <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> dry solids will be available in the furnace. The flue gas heat loss will decrease as the flue gas flow diminishes. Increasing <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> dry solids is especially helpful since the recovery boiler capacity is often limited by the flue gas flow.|$|E

25|$|The first {{generation}} air {{system in the}} 1940s and 1950s consisted of a two level arrangement; primary air for maintaining the reduction zone and secondary air below the liquor guns for final oxidation. The recovery boiler size was 100 – 300 TDS (tons of dry solids) per day. and <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> concentration 45 – 55%. Frequently to sustain combustion auxiliary fuel needed to be fired. Primary air was 60 – 70% of total air with secondary the rest. In all levels openings were small and design velocities were 40 – 45m/s. Both air levels were operated at 150oC. Liquor gun or guns were oscillating. Main problems were high carryover, plugging and low reduction. But the function, combustion of <b>black</b> <b>liquor,</b> could be filled.|$|E
25|$|Fourth {{generation}} {{air systems}} are the multilevel {{air and the}} vertical air.

25|$|Combustion of <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> in the {{recovery}} boiler furnace needs to be controlled carefully.

Total phenolic content was determined in terms of gallic acid equivalents (Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric method), and the antioxidant activity in the crude extracts at several pH values and in the separated fractions was measured using the DPPH test for radical scavenging capacity. The total phenolic content of crude extracts and separated fractions ranged from 92. 7 to 181. 6 and from 91. 6 to 1, 099. 6 mg GAE/g, respectively, while the antioxidant activity index (AAI) ranged from 2. 20 to 3. 41 and from 2. 21 to 11. 47 respectively, showing very strong antioxidant activity in all studied cases.
