40|$|The {{competitive}} dialogue procedure {{is a new}} public procurement award procedure first introduced by the Directive 2004118 for the tender of particularly complex contracts, when contracting authorities consider {{that the use of}} the open or <b>restricted</b> <b>procedures</b> do not allow for the contract to be tendered. It is not intended to be adopted freely as the open or <b>restricted</b> <b>procedures,</b> but contracting authorities may use it only when the need arises and specific grounds for its use are fulfilled. The procedure was introduced with the stated objective of increasing the flexibility of procurement, which had been already identified as a shortcoming of previous existing EU procurement framework. This thesis studies how the {{competitive dialogue}} has been implemented in Portugal and Spain. It covers both the legal transposition and aspects of its practice in these countries., through the use of empirical research methods. Through his research, the author has found that the procedure was implemented very differently in Portugal and Spain with consequences on its use. This study has tried to highlight similarities and differences in the transposition, illustrate how the competitive dialogue is being used in Spain and explain why it is being used only sparingly in Portugal.

By contrast, C 57 mice were good performers in SNT but failed to recognize a novel object in SORT. Finally, food restriction selectively improved C 57 performance in SNT and DBA performance in SORT.

Also, radiation leukaemia virus (RadLV) obtained from the thymus of leukaemic C 57 Bl/ 6 mice was injected i. p. into established chimeras (H- 2 d [...] H- 2 b). As expected, long lived, graft versus host disease free allogeneic chimeras constructed with intact bone marrow were unable to reject the tumours both when recipients were BALB/c [...] C 57 Bl/ 6 or C 57 Bl/ 6 [...] BALB/c chimeras. However, also inoculation {{of a large number}} of immunocompetent cells from normal BALB/c mice into BALB/c [...] C 57 Bl/ 6 chimeras, failed to promote a rejection of the tumours. On the contrary, the same amount of syngeneic (BALB/c) immunocompetent cells prevented growth of melanoma when transferred into athymic nude BALB/c mice, while the tumour grew unimpaired in untreated athymic nude BALB/c mice.

40|$|During primary {{rotavirus}} (RV) infection, CD 8 + T cells play {{an important}} role in viral clearance as well as providing partial protection against reinfection. CD 4 + T cells are essential for maximal development of RV-specific intestinal immunoglobulin A. In this study, we took advantage of the cytokine flow cytometry technique to obtain a detailed map of H- 2 b- and H- 2 d-restricted CD 8 + and CD 4 + T-cell epitopes from the RV proteins VP 6 and VP 7. Three new CD 8 + T-cell epitopes (H- 2 d and H- 2 <b>b</b> <b>restricted)</b> and one new CD 4 + T-cell epitope (H- 2 d and H- 2 <b>b</b> <b>restricted)</b> were identified. Using these newly identified targets, we characterized the development and specificity of cellular immune responses in C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/c mice during acute infection of infants and adults. We found that both the CD 4 + and CD 8 + responses peaked on days 5 to 7 after infection and then declined rapidly. Interestingly, both the response kinetics and tissue distributions were different when epitopes on VP 6 and VP 7 were compared. VP 6 elicited a response which predominated in the intestine, while the response to VP 7 was more systemic. Additionally, the T-cell responses elicited after homologous versus heterologous infection differed substantially. We found that during homologous infection, there was a greater response toward VP 6 than that toward VP 7, especially in the intestine, while after heterologous infection, this was not the case. Finally, in suckling mice, we found two peaks in the CD 8 response on days 7 and 14 postinfection, which differed from the single peak found in adults and likely mimics the biphasic pattern of rotavirus shedding in infant mice...|$|R
