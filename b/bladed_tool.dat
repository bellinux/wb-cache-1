40|$|During the Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic of the Old World, {{the use of}} {{blade and}} bladelet {{technology}} was widespread in parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. In contrast to this situation, the use of elongated debitage in North America occurs relatively infrequently during the Pre-Clovis and Clovis periods. This article examines three assemblages from the Adams and Joe Priddy sites in Kentucky and the Nuckolls site in Tennessee, and notes possible differences between Clovis blade manufacture and use, versus blade production in many Old World settings. These differences include the intensity of core reduction, the relative frequency and proportions of blades (and bladelets), the diversity of <b>blade</b> <b>tool</b> forms, {{and the percentage of}} retouched <b>blade</b> <b>tools</b> to unretouched <b>blades...</b>|$|R
25|$|Flint is {{a compact}} {{microcrystalline}} quartz. It {{is found in}} chalk or marly limestone formations and is formed by a replacement of calcium carbonate with silica. It is commonly found as nodules. This variety was often used in past times to make <b>bladed</b> <b>tools.</b>|$|R

Tied and held {{at the bottom of}} a pot by a rock, the coil is cooked by the boiling water, removing some of the color. The coil is then dried in the sun, opened and the leaves flattened with stick. They are drawn through a small metal <b>bladed</b> <b>tool,</b> which cut each leaf into four or five narrow strips. Edge strips are discarded and other are bundled loosely and left to bleach further in the sun before being resoaked in cold water for about 12 hours. By that time they have been sun-dried and softened with the stick once again, the natural color has almost completely faded and dying can begin." ...|$|E
50|$|Beginning in the Stone Age, glass knives (and other tools, such as arrowheads) were {{produced}} {{through a process}} known as knapping or lithic reduction. Although such <b>bladed</b> <b>tools</b> were often made of stone, naturally occurring glasses such as obsidian, natural volcanic glass, were also commonly used.|$|R

40|$|Low cost {{approaches}} to the design and fabrication of blades for a two-bladed 200 kW wind turbine were identified and {{the applicability of the}} techniques to larger and smaller blades was assessed. <b>Blade</b> <b>tooling</b> was designed and fabricated. Two complete blades and a partial <b>blade</b> for <b>tool</b> tryout were built. The patented TFT process was used to wind the entire blade. This process allows rapid winding of an axially oriented composite onto a tapered mandrel, with tapered wall thickness. The blade consists of a TFT glass-epoxy airfoil structure filament wound onto a steel root end fitting. The fitting is, in turn, bolted to a conical steel adapter section to provide for mounting attachment to the hub. Structural analysis, blade properties, and cost and weight analysis are described...|$|R
50|$|Retouch {{may simply}} consist of roughly {{trimming}} an edge by striking with a hammerstone, or on smaller, finer flake or <b>blade</b> <b>tools</b> {{it is sometimes}} carried out by pressure flaking. Other forms of retouch may include burination, which is retouch that is conducted in a parallel orientation to the flake margin.

50|$|In the basement, {{police found}} two hatchets, two axes, and a hatchet-head {{with a broken}} handle. The hatchet-head was {{suspected}} of being the murder weapon as the break in the handle appeared fresh and the ash and dust on the head, unlike that on the other <b>bladed</b> <b>tools,</b> {{appeared to have been}} deliberately applied to make it look {{as if it had been}} in the basement for some time. However, none of these tools were removed from the house.|$|R
50|$|Emiran culture {{apparently}} {{developed from}} the local Mousterian without rupture, keeping numerous elements of the Levalloise-Mousterian, together with the locally typical Emireh point. The Emireh point is the type tool of stage one of the Upper Paleolithic, first identified in the Emirian or Emireh culture. Numerous stone <b>blade</b> <b>tools</b> were used, including curved knives {{similar to those found}} in the Chatelperronian culture of Western Europe. Like the Chattelperronian, Elmireh is associated with late Neanderthal people rather than with Homo sapiens.|$|R
50|$|Phase six (from 5 to 4 feet down) {{contained}} Neolithic pottery {{fragments and}} domesticated animal bones dated between 7 and 4.7 thousand years old. Flint fragments are found {{as well as}} finished tools, flake-scrapers, arrow-heads, a bifacial knife, trihedral pressure-flaked rods and drill heads. The presence of decorated ostrich eggs and pierced sea shells are also common in this phase. The piercing of these shells {{are thought to be}} for reasons of consumption and were carried out by small <b>bladed</b> <b>tools.</b>|$|R
50|$|Howiesons Poort {{occupation}} manufactured <b>blade</b> <b>tools.</b> These <b>blades</b> {{are shaped}} like the segment of an orange, {{with a sharp}} cutting edge on the straight lateral and an intentionally blunted and curved back. These were attached to shafts or handles by means of ochre and plant adhesive or alternatively fat mixed with plant material. Segments often were made with a cutting edge along their entire length, which requires that they be attached to their hafts without twine and so, calls for particularly strong adhesive glue.|$|R
50|$|A wood moulder is {{a machine}} used to shape wood with {{profiled}} cutters. The profiled cutters are {{also known as}} knives, and <b>blades.</b> <b>Tooling</b> refers to cutters, knives, blades including planer blades, and cutterheads. Most moulders require the blades to be secured into a cutterhead that mounts on the shaft(s) of the machine. However, some machines such as the Williams & Hussey and the Shop Fox require the blades to bolt directly onto the shaft of the machine. The wood being fed into a moulder is {{commonly referred to as}} either “stock” or “blanks”.|$|R

50|$|The housing {{structures}} {{found here}} consisted of circular floors, composed of schist chips and mud pounded {{hard to make}} a hard surface. The walls made of bamboo and mud, provided support to a conical thatched roof. One of the houses was found to have a circular fireplace containing ash and charcoal. The region below the floors was a burial chamber consisting of urns used for child burials. Chalcolithic <b>blade</b> <b>tools</b> of black quartzite, small copper axes and fish hooks were also found. The transition to the Iron Age period is marked by the presence of megaliths and iron implements.|$|R
50|$|The 1689 Bill of Rights {{ensured that}} only Parliament {{and not the}} King could {{restrict}} {{the right of the}} people to bear arms. Over the last 60 years, Parliament has enacted a series of increasingly restrictive laws and acts regarding the possession and use of knives and <b>bladed</b> <b>tools.</b> The United Kingdom (to include England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) has one of the most comprehensive set of laws of any developed nation restricting the right to import, purchase, possess, sell, and carry knives. Ambulance service data gathered in 2009 suggests a slow increase in knife crime incidents in the UK although the overall rate remains low.|$|R

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human activity on the site pre-dating the Iron Age, {{as far back as}} 8,0006,000BC. During this period Mellor may have been a knap site where flint tools were produced, and also may have been a seasonal camp. Over 200lithics have been recovered and range from the early to the late Mesolithic. A high proportion of the flints are <b>bladed</b> <b>tools,</b> indicating that the people who produced them were hunter gatherers. Bronze Age artefacts are rare on the site, and there is no definitive indication of habitation in this period. Despite this, {{it is likely that the}} long-term habitation of the site had its roots in the late Bronze Age.|$|R
40|$|Blade-like {{specimens}} {{were subjected}} to static ballistic impact testing to determine their relative FOD impact resistance levels. It was determined that a plus or minus 15 deg layup exhibited good impact resistance. The design of a large solid boron/aluminum fan blade was conducted based on the FOD test results. The CF 6 fan blade {{was used as a}} baseline for these design studies. The solid boron/aluminum fan blade design was used to fabricate two blades. This effort enabled the assessment of the scale up of existing blade manufacturing details for the fabrication of a large B/Al fan blade.
