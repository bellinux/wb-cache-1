5000|$|In addition, to Modern Air's {{abortive}} {{attempts to}} launch a regular, year round long-haul charter programme from West Berlin in partnership with Berliner Flugring, the airline and its long-standing business partner also attempted {{for a number of}} years to gain all necessary approvals for West Berlin's first-ever charter flight to Moscow as part of a one-off, all-inclusive city <b>break</b> <b>package</b> in the Soviet capital. Modern Air's management hoped to be able to build on its earlier success of 1968, when interventions at the highest level of the US government with its Soviet counterpart had resulted in Modern Air becoming the first US non-scheduled airline to be given permission at short notice to fly a US charter party to Moscow for a brief stopover on its first transpolar flight ("Polar Byrd I"). In addition to being a test of the limits of East-West cooperation in the then prevailing political climate of Détente (which aimed to create a more stable and predictable political environment by easing Cold War tensions), it was thought that this would be a major publicity coup for the airline and help it to raise its public profile further. Despite appearing cooperative initially, the Soviet authorities imposed increasingly onerous conditions on the airline and tour operator for the programme to go ahead. These ultimately proved unworkable and forced its abandonment. Similar to the case of the Bulgarian communist authorities' sudden and unexplained withdrawal of landing and overflight rights for flights originating/terminating in West Berlin (despite the much-needed hard currency Bulgaria earned from air navigation fees and airport user charges paid by the American and British airlines that operated these flights), some Western political observers at the time suspected behind-the-scenes East German lobbying of its Warsaw Pact ally and chief political backer respectively to have caused this to ensure East Germany's political and economic interests were not ignored in its Cold war allies' interactions with the West, especially where these concerned relations with West Berlin.|$|E

40|$|Eukaryotic cells {{distinguish}} their chromosome ends from accidental DNA double-strand <b>breaks</b> by <b>packaging</b> them in {{a protective}} structure {{referred to as the}} telomere "cap. " Here we investigate the nature of the telomere cap by examining events at DNA breaks generated adjacent to either natural telomeric sequences (TG repeats) or arrays of Rap 1 -binding sites that vary in length. Although DNA breaks adjacent to either short or long telomeric sequences are efficiently converted into stable telomeres, they elicit very different initial responses. Short telomeric sequences (80 base pair [bp]) are avidly bound by Mre 11, as well as the telomere capping protein Cdc 13 and telomerase enzyme, consistent with their rapid telomerase-dependent elongation. Surprisingly, little or no Mre 11 binding is detected at long telomere tracts (250 bp), and this is correlated with reduced Cdc 13 and telomerase binding. Consistent with these observations, ends with long telomere tracts undergo strongly reduced exonucleolytic resection and display limited binding by both Rpa 1 and Mec 1, suggesting that they fail to elicit a checkpoint response. Rap 1 binding is required for end concealment at long tracts, but Rif proteins, yKu, and Cdc 13 are not.

Because A-PCD-associated processes are conserved, {{it is possible to}} define A-PCD by a standard set of markers. Many of the popular methods to measure A-PCD make use of fluorescent ligands that change in intensity or cellular localization during A-PCD. In single cell organisms, it is possible to quantify levels of A-PCD by scoring the number of apoptotic cells using flow cytometry instruments. In a multicellular organism, quantification of A-PCD is more problematic due to the complex nature of the tissue. The situation is further complicated in filamentous fungi, in which nuclei are divided between compartments, each containing a number of nuclei, which can also migrate between the compartments. We developed SCAN©, a System for Counting and Analysis of Nuclei, and used it to measure A-PCD according to two markers – chromatin condensation and DNA strand <b>breaks.</b> The <b>package</b> includes three modules designed for counting the number of nuclei in multi-nucleated domains, scoring the relative number of nuclei with condensed chromatin, and calculating the relative number of nuclei with DNA strand breaks.

Here we investigate {{the role of}} key telomeric proteins in protecting budding yeast telomeres from degradation. We show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae shelterin-like proteins Rif 1, Rif 2, and Rap 1 inhibit nucleolytic processing at both de novo and native telomeres during G 1 and G 2 cell cycle phases, with Rif 2 and Rap 1 showing the strongest effects. Also Yku prevents telomere resection in G 1, independently of its role in non-homologous end joining. Yku and the shelterin-like proteins have additive effects in inhibiting DNA degradation at G 1 de novo telomeres, where Yku plays the major role in preventing initiation, whereas Rif 1, Rif 2, and Rap 1 act primarily by limiting extensive resection. In fact, exonucleolytic degradation of a de novo telomere is more efficient in yku 70 D than in rif 2 D G 1 cells, but generation of ssDNA in Yku-lacking cells is limited to DNA regions close to the telomere tip. This limited processing {{is due to the}} inhibitory action of Rap 1, Rif 1, and Rif 2, as their inactivation allows extensive telomere resection not only in wild-type but also in yku 70 D G 1 cells. Finally, Rap 1 and Rif 2 prevent telomere degradation by inhibiting MRX access to telomeres, which are also protected from the Exo 1 nuclease by Yku. Thus...|$|R

The dissolution of condominium <b>breaks</b> apart this <b>package</b> of rights and responsibilities, and results in the termination of the individual titles. Some common law jurisdictions require the unanimous consent of title holders to dissolve condominium, others permit it with a supermajority vote. All jurisdictions allow for non-consensual dissolution, and thus the termination of titles without consent, with a court order. This paper reviews dissolution rules and reform efforts in several common law jurisdictions and then uses the condominium legislation and case law from British Columbia to argue that non-consensual dissolution of condominium, whether by supermajority vote or court order, should be understood as private takings. However, {{the purpose of this}} characterization is not to advocate for a unanimity or a supermajority rule.

Finally, the paper argues that the growing prevalence of condominium as a form of ownership, and its capacity to reflect broader tensions in ownership regimes between individual and community, suggest that the nature of property within condominium is increasingly important in constructing the nature of property in land...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim was to formulate ergonomics criteria {{to assist in the}} design and evaluation of various commonly used packages so that they are well adapted to the needs, capabilities and limitations of consumers. The consumers used in the study included male and female able-bodied subjects, some of whom were elderly; and the disabled, who suffered from arthritis, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, or one-handed function (hemiplegics or amputees). The design criteria took the form of normative data. These were derived, by experiment, with subjects handling specially designed apparatus which closely simulated the characteristics of real packages. The norms were the torques and forces that the weak, average and strong subjects could exert on a range of packages. The norms were related to the breaking torques and <b>breaking</b> forces of <b>packages</b> found in the market place. It was shown that many of these packages require opening torques and forces which are well beyond the capabilities of the weaker sections of the sample. New methods for representing the torques which people can exert were derived, involving the calculation of ratios of centiles between and within groups for comfortable and maximum exertions of torque. It is suggested that this method, which has considerable promise, be further validated in future studies involving not only the description of forces and torques, but also that of the reaches, carrying and lifting capacity, the articulation, pushing and pulling capacity, and physical endurance of human subjects. The promise lies in the short-hand derivation of the capabilities of weaker segments of the population, who are difficult to obtain in large numbers, from studies involving small samples from the fit and able population...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{provides}} the blueprint for cell function and growth, {{as well as}} ensuring continuity from one cell generation to the next. In order to compact, protect, and regulate this vital information, DNA is packaged by histone proteins into nucleosomes, which are the fundamental subunits of chromatin. Reactive oxygen species, generated by both endogenous and exogenous agents, can react with DNA, altering base chemistry and generating DNA strand breaks. Left unrepaired, these oxidation products can result in mutations and/or cell death. The Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway exists to deal with damaged bases and single-stranded DNA <b>breaks.</b> However, the <b>packaging</b> of DNA into chromatin provides roadblocks to repair. Damaged DNA bases may be buried within nucleosomes, where they are inaccessible to repair enzymes and other DNA binding proteins. Previous in vitro studies by our lab have demonstrated that BER enzymes can function within this challenging environment, albeit in a reduced capacity. Exposure to ionizing radiation often results in multiple, clustered oxidative lesions. Near-simultaneous BER of two lesions located on opposing strands within a single helical turn of DNA of one another creates multiple DNA single-strand break intermediates. This, in turn, may create a potentially lethal double-strand break (DSB) that {{can no longer be}} repaired by BER. To determine if chromatin offers protection from this phenomenon, we incubated DNA glycosylases with nucleosomes containing clustered damages in an attempt to generate DSBs. We discovered that nucleosomes offer substantial protection from inadvertent DSB formation. Steric hindrance by the histone core in the nucleosome was a major factor in restricting DSB formation. As well, lesions positioned very close to one another were refractory to processing, with one lesion blocking or disrupting access to the second site. The nucleosome itself appears to remain intact during DSB formation, and in some cases, no DNA is released from the histones. Taken together, these results suggest that in vivo, DSBs generated by BER occur primarily in regions of the genome associated with elevated rates of nucleosome turnover or remodeling, and in the short linker DNA segments that lie between adjacent nucleosomes. DNA ligase IIIα (LigIIIα) catalyzes the final step in BER. In order to facilitate repair, DNA ligase must completely encircle the DNA helix. Thus, DNA ligase must at least transiently disrupt histone-DNA contacts. To determine how LigIIIα functions in nucleosomes, given this restraint, we incubated the enzyme with nick-containing nucleosomes. We found that a nick located further within the nucleosome was ligated at a lower rate than one located closer to the edge. This indicated that LigIIIα must wait for DNA to spontaneously, transiently unwrap from the histone octamer to expose the nick for recognition. Remarkably, the disruption that must occur for ligation is both limited and transient: the nucleosome remains resistant to enzymatic digest before and during ligation, and reforms completely once LigIIIα dissociates...|$|R
40|$|The fast-growing {{market on}} {{electronic}} portable devices is possibly {{due to the}} development of Li-ion batteries. Besides, such batteries are the most promising candidates as energy storage media in (hybrid) electric vehicles, in the near future. However, improvements on electrochemical performances and on safety need to be achieved. With respect to energy density, positive electrodes with a high voltage vs. Li/Li+ are favourable, provided they are stable against the rest of the battery materials, thereby reflecting safety issues. Regarding this safety, misuse of a Li-ion battery often leads to promoting side reactions between the electrodes and the electrolyte. This then results in gas formation, <b>packaging</b> <b>breaking</b> and fire evolution due to exposure to air by reaction of highly reactive materials with oxygen. Therefore, novel electrolytes, such as ionic liquids are proposed, which may significantly reduce these parasitic reactions with the electrodes, and further allows the battery to operate at higher voltages due to its high voltage stability window. In this respect, the presented work concerns the research on a high voltage positive electrode material in combination with ionic liquids as electrolyte solvents. In Chapter 1, a brief history about the Li-ions intercalation concept, which is at the basis of Li-ion batteries, is introduced. Afterwards, the most important components of a Li-ion battery are discussed. Examples of negative and positive electrodes are shown, emphasizing the reasons why nano structures are to preferred in the beginning. Besides, ionic liquids are introduced and explained, as possible candidates as electrolytes or electrolyte additives. In Chapter 2, the synthesis of magnesium-doped nickel-based high-voltage positive electrode materials (LiMg 0. 05 Ni 0. 45 Mn 1. 5 O 4) via four different synthesis routes is shown: a solid-state method; a sol-gel method; a xerogel route and an auto-ignition method. A preliminary structural analysis is performed with XRD and SEM, showing the crystallinity and the agglomerations of the powders, respectively. Furthermore, TEM analysis on the powders showed agglomerated nanoparticles ranging from 10 nm to 200 nm. Finally, electrodes made with the synthesized materials are tested with a charge-discharge galvanostatic technique, showing the existence of impurity - mainly LiMn 2 O 4, increasing from sol-gel, xerogel, to auto-ignition. It also gives promising results in terms of capacity retention at high charge-discharge rates. In Chapter 3, the powders made via the auto-ignition method, which showed the most promising result in the previous chapter, were further studied with an in situ charge-discharge galvanostatic technique coupled with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), which proved the presence of manganese ions in LiMg 0. 05 Ni 0. 45 Mn 1. 5 O 4 being reduced and oxidized, explained by the presence of manganese-rich nanodomains within the particles. Chapter 4 concerns certain safety issues of Li-ion batteries. Here, ionic liquids as possible novel electrolyte additives are studied as possible candidates to contribute to safer batteries. In this respect, the CO 2 -adsorption ability of the ionic liquid N-buthyl-N-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIm][BF 4]) is tested with a Cailletet apparatus. The interaction between ionic liquids and CO 2 has been analyzed from a thermodynamical point of view. The most common theories to study the gas and gas-liquid mixtures were introduced, together with a novel approach based on the Langmuir adsorption theory. In contrast to most models, the Langmuir isotherm has a very general approach: the solvent is seen as a storage medium, in which the number of available sites depends on the number of available solvent species which adsorb gas molecules. The Langmuir model {{can be used in a}} wide concentration range and the dissolution energies, together with the entropy values, can be calculated. In the case of the presence of a lithium salt, the Langmuir model could easily be extended to the Langmuir-Hinselwood model, so as to take the adsorption/association of lithium ions to the solvent sites into account. In the [BMIm][BF 4] + CO 2 system studied, both the Langmuir and Langmuir-Hinselwood models could be very well used to explain the results. The obtained solubility energy and entropy do not differ so much from the evaporation energy and entropy of pure CO 2, showing small solvent-CO 2 interaction. When to the mixture [BMIm][BF 4] + CO 2 a lithium salt, i. e., LiBF 4 is added, a Langmuir-Hinselwood isotherm describes the obtained data very well. However, addition of the salt reduces the amount of CO 2 that can be dissolved. Actually, the results of applying this model show that the lithium ions rather stay at the anion, preventing dissociation of the salt in this IL. Consequently, it can be argued that the lithium salt, even if undissociated provides sites which can be exploited by either the lithium ions or by the CO 2 molecules, as they contribute to the equilibrium equations. In Chapter 5, the electrochemical behavior of PYR 14 TFSI + LiTFSI is studied in relation to electrodes made from LiMg 0. 05 Ni 0. 45 Mn 1. 5 O 4 (LMNMO). In this respect, cyclic voltammetry (from 3. 5 to 4. 9 V) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have been used. For further comparison, also batteries made with a commercially available electrolyte has been exploited. The cyclic voltammetry showed slower redox processes regarding the cell with the ionic liquid. Another cell with the ionic liquid has been tested at a lower cycle scan rate up to 5. 2 V, proving that the current is significantly hampered by kinetics in this ionic liquid. However, it showed the stability of the system a higher voltages compared to the battery with the commercial electrolyte. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the system with the ionic liquid showed a process which was not present in the cell with the commercial electrolyte, possibly introduced by the slow kinetics. However, in symmetrical cells with metallic lithium at both sides, it was possible to ascribe the EIS features of the cell with the commercial electrolyte to the lithium-electrolyte interface. On the other hand, EIS measurements of the battery with the ionic liquid reveals the presence of a layer also at the LMNMO-electrolyte side, which continuously grows upon cycling. In summary, while the positive electrode materials can be employed in novel Li-ion batteries, provided they have a higher purity, the use of ionic liquids as electrolytes is still hampered by their poor electrochemical performances. Nevertheless, they are still promising, due to their electrochemical stability at high voltages. Besides, thanks to their high gas-adsorption ability, ionic liquids can be taken into consideration as electrolyte additives, for safety purposes. DelftChemTechApplied Science...|$|R
