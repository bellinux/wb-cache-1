5|$|Inside, Davos pleads with Melisandre {{to attempt}} to resurrect Jon, {{reminding}} her of her previous miracles. Though Melisandre's faith has <b>been</b> <b>shattered</b> by Stannis Baratheon's defeat, she is reminded of her encounter with Thoros of Myr, and attempts a ritual, but seemingly to no avail. Defeated, Melisandre, Davos, Edd and Tormund leave the room. Within moments, Jon suddenly awakens on the table.|$|E
5|$|Vesta is {{the only}} known intact {{asteroid}} that has been resurfaced in this manner. Because of this, some scientists refer to Vesta as a protoplanet. However, the presence of iron meteorites and achondritic meteorite classes without identified parent bodies indicates that there once were other differentiated planetesimals with igneous histories, which have since <b>been</b> <b>shattered</b> by impacts.|$|E

5|$|Lisa hates {{her role}} as a homemaker, and realizing that her future dreams have <b>been</b> <b>shattered,</b> she loses {{interest}} in being a good student. Bart enjoys spending time with the police, and he even ends up stopping Snake during a car chase. When Principal Skinner discovers Bart's new interest in law enforcement, he enlists him as a hall monitor. Bart starts handing out demerits to his classmates for minor infractions and has order restored to the school. When Lisa secretly steals all of the Teachers' Editions of the schoolbooks and reveals the teachers' lack of education, it is up to Bart to figure out who stole the books. Realizing his sister is the culprit, Bart takes the blame and returns to his life as a bad student and detention regular, while Lisa goes back to being a good student. As Bart spents his time in detention, Lisa plays her saxophone outside his classroom to comfort him.|$|E
5|$|Several {{theoretical}} {{objections to}} the claims of Fermi's paper were quickly raised; in particular, the exact process that took place when an atom captured a neutron was not well understood at the time. This and Fermi's accidental discovery three months later that nuclear reactions could be induced by slow neutrons cast further doubt {{in the minds of}} many scientists, notably Aristid von Grosse and Ida Noddack, that the experiment was creating element 93. While von Grosse's claim that Fermi was actually producing protactinium (element 91) was quickly tested and disproved, Noddack's proposal that the uranium had <b>been</b> <b>shattered</b> into two or more much smaller fragments was simply ignored by most because existing nuclear theory did not include a way for this to be possible. Fermi and his team maintained that they were in fact synthesizing a new element, but the issue remained unresolved for several years.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Professor E. Gadd completes his newest {{invention}} {{of a time}} machine powered by a gem called the Cobalt Star, which is presented at Peach's Castle. Peach enters the time machine into the past, but fails to return, only leaving {{a member of an}} alien species known only as the Shroobs within the damaged time machine. The Mushroom Kingdom of the past had actually been invaded by the Shroobs, with Peach being kidnapped and held hostage at her castle. After defeating the monster, a time hole opens, leaving a passageway into the past. While searching for Peach, Mario and Luigi locate their younger selves, and agree to locate the crystal shards, which are remnants of the Cobalt Star which had <b>been</b> <b>shattered</b> during Peach's journey. Unwittingly, the brothers collect all of the shards, while being pestered by Baby Bowser (Bowser in the past) who wants the Cobalt Star. At the end, they restore the Cobalt Star only to unleash the Elder Princess Shroob, who serves as the game's final boss character. The story ends when she is defeated, Peach is rescued, and the past returns to normal.|$|E

In the midst of this disarray, the European balance of power was restructured with the creation of the German Empire as the dominant power in continental Europe apart from Russia. This was achieved by Bismarck's diplomacy, Roon's reorganization of the army and Moltke's military strategy.|$|E

By May 1959, Wright wanted to leave Paris and live in London. He felt French politics had become increasingly submissive to United States pressure. The peaceful Parisian atmosphere he had enjoyed had <b>been</b> <b>shattered</b> by quarrels and attacks instigated by enemies of the expatriate black writers.|$|E

25|$|On 6 May 1937 the LZ 129 Hindenburg {{caught fire}} and {{exploded}} while mooring in Lakehurst, New Jersey, killing 35 {{people as well}} as CEO Ernst Lehmann. The disaster dramatically changed the fortunes of the DZR. Hindenburg was covered by insurance of 6 million RM, which was paid in full, but the loss of future passenger revenue was not. Public confidence in Zeppelin travel had also <b>been</b> <b>shattered</b> and the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin was immediately grounded on its return flight from Brazil on 8 May 1937.|$|E
25|$|Police had {{established}} a command post {{two blocks from the}} restaurant. They initially did not know how many shooters were inside, since Huberty was using firearms of several different types, and rapidly firing numerous shots. Because most of the restaurant's windows had <b>been</b> <b>shattered</b> by gunfire, reflections from shards of glass made it difficult for police to see inside. A police sniper who was part of the SWAT team was positioned {{on the roof of the}} post office next door to the McDonald's. He was authorized to kill Huberty should he have a clear shot.|$|E

In 905 he provided funds to the Church of Silva Candida, which had been devastated by a Saracen raid. He also helped with the rebuilding of Nonantola Abbey, which had suffered attacks from the Magyars, and finally he granted privileges to some monasteries and churches in West and East Francia.|$|E

That ideal has <b>been</b> <b>shattered.</b> Now we have the pretension of being an open and attentive socialist welfare state, but in fact, that message only comes from a single direction. The system only responds to those who shout. Those who are silent remain on the outside. The basic human element has disappeared from the system.|$|E
25|$|The crater {{must have}} {{originally}} been deep, {{with a high}} mountainous rim and towering central peak. Over time the crater floor has relaxed to the spherical shape of the Tethyan surface, and the crater's rim and central peak have collapsed (similar relaxation is apparent on Jupiter's moons Callisto and Ganymede). This indicates {{that at the time}} of the Odysseus impact, Tethys must have been sufficiently warm and malleable to allow the topography to collapse; its interior may have even been liquid. If Tethys had been colder and more brittle at the time of impact, the moon might have <b>been</b> <b>shattered,</b> and even if it survived the impact, the topography of the crater would have retained its shape, similarly to the crater Herschel on Mimas.|$|E
25|$|On 1 December the Romanian attack began. Initially, the Romanians {{experienced}} success, {{taking a}} large number of prisoners, however, the failure of their reserves to arrive due to the actions of the Romanian General Sosescu, who was a naturalized German, followed by the arrival of German reinforcements led to their weakening and eventual defeat. Mackensen was able to shift forces to deal with the sudden assault and Falkenhayn's forces responded with attacks at every point. Within three days, the attack had <b>been</b> <b>shattered</b> and the Romanians were retreating everywhere. Part of the Romanian Army was cut off from the city after German forces conducted a pincer movement north and south of the river. The Romanians suffered a considerable setback when a staff car carrying attack plans accidentally drove into a German position and was captured.|$|E
