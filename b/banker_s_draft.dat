The <b>S</b> <b>draft</b> tube has two bend portions, first and second bends. Separation occurs here. The pressure recovery becomes low because of the separation. The paper proposes a new-type <b>S</b> <b>draft</b> tube which has the highest pressure recovery coefficient. One of the characteristics of the new draft tube is a twisted portion in the middle of the <b>S</b> <b>draft</b> tube. Asymmetrical secondary flow is generated in the twisted portion of the new <b>S</b> <b>draft</b> tube. The pressure recovery coefficient Cpo is largely improved because such asymmetrical secondary flow prevents the separation on the bend portion of the <b>S</b> <b>draft</b> tube. Such phenomena are assured by measuring the velocity distribution in the draft tube...|$|R

As outdoor wiring is not easy, the multi-hop technology of wireless mesh network becomes more important. IEEE 802.11 s working group aims to build the wireless mesh network standard.

In IEEE 802.11 <b>s</b> <b>draft,</b> the medium access control (MAC) protocol has great influence for wireless LAN performance[2] and it follows the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) of the original IEEE 802.11 e[3], containing congestion control[4], power saving[5], synchronization[6, 7], and beacon collision avoidance[8].

30|$|With the {{popularity}} of {{wireless local area network}} (LAN), increasing the network coverage is the necessary development. IEEE 802.11 <b>s</b> <b>draft</b> [1] divides nodes into two categories, including mesh node and non-mesh node. A mesh node can support mesh services, but non-mesh node cannot, e.g., the original IEEE 802.11 station (STA) is a non-mesh node [2]. Mesh nodes are divided into two categories: mesh point (MP), which only supports mesh services such as route selection and packet forwarding; mesh access point (MAP), which provides access point (AP) functions for STAs and mesh services. For compatibility with the IEEE 802.11 LAN, wireless mesh LAN must be able to link with other networks; therefore, a mesh point portal (MPP) provides the functions of layer 2 bridge and layer 3 interworking [3]. Wireless mesh LAN topology can be mainly divided into 802.11 connected mesh and 802.11  mesh ad hoc[4]. In IEEE 802.11 <b>s</b> <b>draft,</b> the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol has great influence for wireless mesh LAN performance [5, 6] and it follows the original IEEE 802.11 e enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) [7], including congestion control [8, 9], power saving [10], synchronization [11] and beacon collision avoidance [12], and quality of service (QoS) [13 – 15].|$|R
