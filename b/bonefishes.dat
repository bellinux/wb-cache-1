5000|$|Albulidae is {{a family}} of fish, {{commonly}} known as the <b>bonefishes,</b> that are popular as game fish in Florida, select locations in the South Pacific and the Bahamas (where two bonefish are featured on the 10-cent coin) and elsewhere. The family is small, with 11 species in 3 genera. Presently, the <b>bonefishes</b> are in their own order: Albuliformes [...] The families Halosauridae and Notacanthidae were previously classified in this order, but are now, according to FishBase, given their own order Notacanthiformes. The largest bonefish caught in the Western Hemisphere is a 16-pound, 3 ounce example caught off Islamorada, Florida, on March 19, 2007.|$|E

The one characteristic uniting this group of fishes is they all have leptocephalus larvae, which are unique to the Elopomorpha. No other fishes have this type of larvae.|$|E
40|$|In 2007, due {{to growing}} {{concerns}} of declines in nearshore fisheries in Hawai'i, {{a ban on}} gillnets was implemented in designated areas around the island of O'ahu in the main Hawaiian Islands. Utilizing a 17 year time-series of juvenile fish abundance beginning prior {{to the implementation of}} the gillnet ban, we examined the effects of the ban on the abundance of juveniles of soft-bottom associated fish species. Using a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) sampling design, we compared the abundance of targeted fishery species in a bay where gillnet fishing was banned (Kailua, O'ahu), and an adjacent bay where fishing is still permitted (Waimānalo, O'ahu). Our results show that when multiple juvenile fish species were combined, abundance declined over time in both locations, but the pattern varied {{for each of the four}} species groups examined. <b>Bonefishes</b> were the only species group with a significant BACI effect, with higher abundance in Kailua in the period after the gillnet ban. This study addressed a need for scientific assessment of a fisheries regulation that is rarely possible due to lack of quality data before enactment of such restrictions. Thus, we developed a baseline status of juveniles of an important fishery species, and found effects of a fishery management regulation in Hawai'i...|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2014. Major:Conservation Biology. Advisors: Dr. Jay Hatch and Dr. Loren Miller. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 124 pages. <b>Bonefishes</b> (Albuliformes: Albula) are tropical marine fishes {{that are the}} focus of a valuable recreational fishery. Despite substantial research interest, their global diversity, fishery composition, and phylogenetic relationships remain uncertain. <b>Bonefishes</b> exhibit significant morphological conservatism; cryptic species have been identified, complicating conservation efforts. My research addresses these lingering questions to ensure effective management. In the first chapter of this dissertation, I resurrect Albula goreensis (Valenciennes 1847) from synonymy with Albula vulpes (Linnaeus 1758) and apply the name to a cryptic sympatric congener based on an integrated taxonomic approach, using multilocus molecular, ecological, and behavioral evidence. Genetic assignment tests based on microsatellites correctly diagnose A. goreensis from congeners (posterior probabilities= 0. 97 - 1. 0). Phylogenetic analyses based on cytochrome b yielded substantial divergence among Atlantic lineages (d= 0. 08 - 0. 10), and five nucleotides were diagnostic for A. goreensis. Microhabitat use, pelagic larval duration, and growth rate differences have been documented between A. goreensis and A. vulpes. Phylogenetic distinctiveness in sympatry, and ecological and behavioral differences are considered strong evidence that A. goreensis is valid and distinct from congeners. In regions with intensive fisheries, information is needed on species ranges and stock structure. In Chapter 2, I explore the distributions, genetic structure, and occurrence of hybrids among three members of the Atlantic bonefish (Albula sp.) complex, using 19 microsatellite loci. Samples were analyzed from 14 locations across the Caribbean Sea and western Atlantic region, with one external sample from the eastern Atlantic. The species in the complex were broadly sympatric across the region; though local level overlap was variable, likely due to habitat partitioning. Analyses identified Albula vulpes as the species predominantly supporting the coastal flats recreational fishery. Unexpected population partitioning was identified within all three species, but the partitions co-occurred within most geographic locations. No clear geographic or temporal patterns were revealed. A strong, consistent identification of two A. vulpes genetic populations was further supported by hypothesis testing for migration patterns between them. Hybrids occurred at low frequency, and results suggested a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic semi-permeable barriers to gene flow exist among these divergent species. Lastly, advanced phylogenetic methods can clarify evolutionary relationships and offer insights into the potential geographic drivers of diversity. In the third chapter I present a multilocus phylogenetic assessment of Albuliformes. The results support recognition of all known members of Albula as distinct species, including several morphological cryptics that occur in sympatry. The broader phylogenetic relationships inferred between Albuliformes and other elopomorphs suggest the genus Pterothrissus is not a member of Albuliformes, warranting additional revisions to the order. Estimated dates of divergence within Albuliformes further suggest up to four invasions of the Atlantic Ocean through multiple historical routes. Two pairs of transisthmian geminate species were identified, though divergence well predates final closure of the Isthmus of Panama.

40|$|Poverty {{reduction}} or alleviation {{is one of}} {{the most}} important economic aspects of Millennium Development Goals (MDG) which introduced by UNO in the Millennium Declaration at the Millennium Summit in 2000. This declaration lays out eight goals that align with the UN's main functions to be met by 2015. In order to meet these goals, poorer countries have pledged to invest in their people through health care and education while wealthier nations have vowed to support them by providing aid, debt relief, and fair trade. When developing countries were adversely affected by this bad economic condition and they began a process of development activities. Consequently, Poverty reduction has come to play a vital role in international development agenda during the last two decades. A number of developing countries have been formed to improve poverty reduction programme among the people and society. In line with this, Sri Lanka too has attempted to improve its poverty reduction since her independence. The main objective of this study is to assess the benefits to people of engaging in poor life condition with in Maruthamunai area of South Eastern part of Sri Lanka. A comparative analysis model was used to estimate the impact of Shakath Foundation on poverty reduction from selected explanatory variables. One of the key findings of this study is that in terms of size of the income and per capita income of the Maruthamunai has benefited immensely from Shakath Foundation programme. This study also reveals that Shakath Foundation has promoted income, wealth and self-employment to a considerable level at Maruthamunai economic way of life. It has also been found that the number of contributors has been increase occasionally meanwhile reducing a number of <b>bonefishes</b> for applying for funds. As Maruthamunai has been able to make significant gains from Shakath Foundation with other contributors, it is advisable that Maruthamunai reduces or eliminates all barriers simultaneously. Marthamunai could make further gains by moving into more advanced stages of institutions such as Baithulmal and Islamic Banking...|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Bonefish</b> (Albula spp.) are {{a popular}} target for {{recreational}} anglers practicing primarily catch-and-release (C&R). The effects of C&R on <b>bonefish</b> have been previously examined in subtropical regions of The Bahamas. However, {{it is unclear}} how these findings relate to larger <b>bonefish,</b> as well as those caught in warmer, tropical environments. Here we examined the effects of C&R on physiological stress and reflex im-pairment in <b>bonefish</b> in tropical Culebra, Puerto Rico. <b>Bonefish</b> (Albula vulpes; 56. 6 ± 5. 0 cm total length, mean ± SE) were angled with spinning or fly fishing gear and either handled entirely in the water without air exposure (n = 12) or exposed to air for 2 min to simulate an aerial hook removal and admiration period (n = 11). Upon capture, <b>bonefish</b> were assessed for the presence of five reflexes and held in floating net pens for 1 h prior to phlebotomy for quantification of physiological stress. Blood lactate and pH were correlated with fight time, but linear models showed air exposure and water tem-perature were better predictors of physiological stress. Compared to previous research using simulated angling events, larger <b>bonefish</b> in warmer water under true an-gling scenarios had similar physiological stress responses. Two minutes of air exposure caused signifi-cant reflex impairment, which is a strong predictor of post release behavioural impairment and mortality risk in this species. Air exposure should be avoided with <b>bonefish,</b> especially with larger fish and at warmer water temperatures to minimize negative impacts and ensure the sustainability of C&R <b>bonefish</b> angling...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bonefish</b> (Albula spp.) support {{valuable}} {{recreational and}} artisanal fisheries worldwide. Declining stocks {{have been reported}} at multiple localities, potentially jeopardising numerous multimillion-dollar industries. In particular, tourism generated through <b>bonefish</b> fly fishing contributes considerably to the economies of many isolated tropical islands and atolls. However, despite their economic value, {{little is known about}} <b>bonefish</b> in the Indian Ocean. This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of <b>bonefish</b> ecology in the Indian Ocean by (1) reviewing the <b>bonefish</b> literature to identify knowledge gaps; (2) evaluating the postrelease survival of acoustically tagged <b>bonefish</b> and; (3) quantifying the spatial and temporal movements of <b>bonefish</b> at a near-pristine and predator rich atoll in the Seychelles. A review of published literature on <b>bonefish</b> indicated that despite considerable biological and ecological research in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, virtually no research has been conducted in the Indian Ocean. To help address this research gap, an acoustic telemetry study was initiated at the remote St. Joseph Atoll, within an existing array of 88 automated datalogging acoustic receivers. Thirty Albula glossodonta were surgically implanted with Vemco V 13 acoustic transmitters in May 2015 and tracked for a period of one year. Only 10 % of the tagged <b>bonefish</b> were detected for more than two weeks. A comparison of the final 100 hours of movement data from fish that were detected for less than two weeks to fish detected for longer periods revealed distinct differences. These included differences in area use patterns and significant differences in the average daily distance moved, speed of movement and residency index. This suggested that mortality in the form of post-release predation was high (90 %) with tagged fish detected for less than two weeks being preyed upon by sharks. The three surviving <b>bonefish</b> were tracked for 210 to 367 days. These individuals remained in the atoll and showed high use of the marginal habitats between the shallow sand flats and the deeper lagoon. Water temperature, diel cycle and tide were significant predictors of <b>bonefish</b> presence in the lagoon. The high post-release predation of <b>bonefish</b> has implications for the management of this and other Albula species. Despite these fisheries being catch-and-release, <b>bonefish</b> fishing may be unsustainable due to the high post-release mortality, particularly in areas that are rich in predators. Therefore, protected areas or limitations on fishing effort need to be considered...|$|R
60|$|I {{just had}} a talk with a fellow who claims to know {{a good deal about}} <b>bonefishing.</b> He said he had caught a good many ranging up to eight pounds.

And I assume that he meant muddy places in the water that had been stirred up by <b>bonefish.</b> Of course, any place where these little swirls could be seen was very likely to be a <b>bonefish</b> bank. He claimed that it was necessary to hold the line near the reel between the forefingers, and to feel for the very slightest vibration. <b>Bonefish</b> have a sucker-like mouth. They draw the bait in, and smash it. Sometimes, of course, they move away, drawing out the line, but that kind of a bite is exceptional.
