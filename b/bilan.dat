U referatu se pokušava objasniti pitanje udjela Hotela Lambert i Hrvata u nastanku političkog plana poznatog kao ”Načertanije”. Treba podsjetiti da je Hotel Lambert bio aristokratski tabor poljske emigracije u razdoblju između 1833. i 1870.

It took its name from the Parisian palace of the head of this organization, prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski (1770 - 1861). Despite some deep-seeded stereotypes, the Lambert Hotel and the Croatian Illyrians never participated directly in the creation of the “Načertanije”, and the indirect participation therein of the Lambert Hotel was no more crucial than the participation of Croatian “Illyrians”. In other words, there are no grounds to label prince Czartoryski as a source of inspiration for the recent greatserbian aggression...|$|R

The most important inflow and outflow variables are used in an equation system (the water balance for each period of time) for these interactions and the total inflow and outflow.

40|$|The {{modelling}} {{and analysis}} of the plasma dynamics in tokamaks using the port-Hamiltonian approach is the main project purpose. Thermo-mMagnetohydrodynamics balances have been written in port-Hamiltonian form using Stokes-Dirac interconnection structures and 3 D differential forms. A simplified 1 D model for control has been derived using quasi-static and symmetry assumptions. It has been proved to be equivalent to a classical 1 D control model: the resistive diffusion model for the poloidal magnetic flux. Then a geometric spatial integration scheme has been developped. It preserves both the symplecticity of the Dirac interconnection structure and physically conserved extensive quantities. This will allow coming works on energy-based approaches for the non linear control of the plasma dynamics. An Interconnection and Damping Assignment - Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC), the most general Port-Hamiltonian control, is chosen first to deal with the studied Tokamak system. It is based on a model made of the two coupled PDEs of resistive diffusion for the magnetic poloidal flux and of radial thermal diffusion. The used TMHD couplings are the Lorentz forces (with non-uniform resistivity) and the bootstrap current. The loop voltage at the plasma boundary, the total external current and the plasma heating power are considered as controller outputs. Due to the actuator constraints which imply to have a physically feasible current profile deposits, a feedforward control is used to ensure the compatibility with the actuator physical capability. Then, the IDA-PBC controllers, both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional, are designed to improve the system stabilization and convergence speed. The proposed works are validated against the simulation data obtained from the Tore-Supra WEST (CEA/Cadarache, France) test case and from RAPTOR code for the TCV real-time control system (CRPP/ EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). L'objectif principal de la thèse est d'établir un modèle sous forme hamiltonienne à ports pour la dynamique du plasma dans les réacteurs de fusion de type tokamak, puis de démontrer le potentiel de cette approche pour aborder les problèmes d'intégration numérique et de commande non linéaire. Les <b>bilans</b> thermo-magnéto-hydrodynamiques, écrits sous forme hamiltonienne à ports à l'aide de structures Stokes-Dirac, conduisent à un modèle 3 D “ multi-physique ” du plasma. Ensuite, un modèle 1 D équivalent au modèle de diffusion résistive est obtenu en supposant les mêmes hypothèses d'équilibre quasi-statique et de symétries. Un schéma symplectique de réduction spatiale de ce modèle 1 D qui préserve la structure du modèle et ses invariants est établi. Il ouvre la voie à des travaux ultérieurs de commande non linéaire fondés sur la structure géométrique d'interconnexion et les <b>bilans</b> du modèle. La commande IDA-PBC (Interconnection and Damping Assignment - Passivity Based Control) basée sur la passivité du modèle est d'abord synthétisée pour ce système en dimension finie.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Beaver dams are {{ubiquitous}} in subarctic wetlands, where runoff {{in the flat}} terrain is highly prone to changes as the stream courses are modified by beaver activities. Depending {{on the state of}} preservation, stream flow can overtop or funnel through gaps in the dams, leak {{from the bottom of the}} dams or seep through the entire structure. Peak and low flows are regulated by these dams to a varying extent. The formation of beaver ponds causes local flooding, while the open water surfaces of the ponds increase water loss from the wetlands. Water spilled from the dams may cause diversion channels to produce complex drainage patterns. Comparing the water balance of basins with and without a beaver dam at its outlet confirms that the dammed basin lost more water to evaporation, suppressed the outflow and increased the basin water storage. Key words: beaver, wetland, beaver dam, stream flow, basin storage, wetland drainage, Subarctic RÉSUMÉ.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} (numerical {{analysis}} and scientific computation areas), {{we are interested}} in the knowledge of the numerical entropy dissipation associated with a given numerical scheme. It turns out that generally speaking, this problem is still open while being of crucial interest in many applications. Our study is composed of two distinct parts. The first one is concerned with the numerical approximation of the (unsteady in 1 D and steady in 2 D) solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations involving several independent pressure laws. As in the usual setting of a single pressure law, this system is hyperbolic with genuinely non linear associated fields under classical assumptions. However, it naturally writes in non conservation form. The second one deals with the numerical approximation of the unsteady solutions (in 1 D) of several systems of conservation laws which are either hyperbolic but with non genuinely non linear (and non linearly degenerate) fields, or mixed hyperbolic-elliptic. Several models from the physics enter the present framework for which the entropy dissipation {{plays an important role in}} the selection of the physical solution. Here we propose several relevant numerical schemes designed on the basis of a precise study of the associated entropy dissipation. La presente recherche doctorale en analyse numerique (et calcul scientifique) aborde le probleme du controle de la dissipation d'entropie numerique associee a une discretisation donnee. Cette problematique constitue un veritable challenge numerique non encore completement resolu a ce jour. Le travail se decompose en deux parties principales dont les caracteristiques sont reellement differentes. La premiere partie concerne l'approximation numerique des solutions (instationnaires en 1 D et stationnaires en 2 D) du systeme des equations de Navier-Stokes a plusieurs pressions independantes. Ce systeme est hyperbolique et possede des champs vraiment non lineaires sous des hypotheses classiques, mais s'ecrit naturellement sous forme non conservative. La deuxieme partie est dediee a l'approximation numerique des solutions instationnaires en 1 D de quelques systemes de lois de conservation de type soit hyperbolique mais dont les champs possedent un defaut de vraiment non linearite, ou soit mixte hyperbolique-elliptique. Dans toutes ces situations motivees par des applications physiques concretes, le controle de la dissipation d'entropie joue un role déterminant dans la caracterisation des solutions recherchees.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to explore the {{influence}} of sea surface temperature (SST), on surface wind at seasonal and intraseasonal timescales. At seasonal timescales, momentum and convergence budget were first documented by using a simple atmospheric mixed layer model, and two reanalyses. This approach allows us to identify the main processes that control the surface wind dynamics, in order to explore their sensitivity to the SST. Results show that these processes vary strongly in different regions of the tropical Atlantic. In addition, the comparison of the representation of theses processes in observations and reanalyses show that, as in all climate models (coupled or not), the reanalyses have the same flaws. Eventually, this work proposes a method to better assess the capacity of an atmospheric model to answer the SST fluctuations, and investigate potential wrong atmospheric parameterizations, such as boundary layers. The second part of this study focuses on tropical Atlantic regions of strong SST gradients, where SST intraseasonal variability is the largest. Several technics of spectrum and statistical analysis were performed in order to investigate the atmospheric patterns associated to these fluctuations of oceanic fronts. Except in the equatorial region (where we found a clear coupling already described in previous studies), no clear hint of a surface wind response to the SST fluctuations was observed in the two coastal upwelling fronts. In addition, the oceanic patterns associated to the SST indexes were also investigated. In all three upwelling fronts, as expected for such upwelling regimes, the vertical oceanic mixing clearly dominates the mixed-layer heat budget. In the equatorial band, as found in previous studies, the horizontal advection is equally important, while it appears surprisingly weak in the coastal fronts. Eventually, potential signals of equatorial and coastal Kelvin waves were also followed to these coastal fronts. Cette thèse vise à explorer l'influence des températures de surface de l'océan (TSO) sur les vents de surface en Atlantique tropical aux échelles saisonnière et intrasaisonnière. Nous avons commencé par étudier les <b>bilans</b> de moment cinétique et de convergence des vents de surface, avec un modèle simple de couche de mélange atmosphérique et des réanalyses, afin d'identifier les processus liés à l'influence des TSO sur le vent de surface. La comparaison de ces résultats avec les observations montre que les réanalyses souffrent de problèmes communs à tous les modèles de climat, couplés ou non : nous proposons donc au final d'appliquer notre méthode pour évaluer la capacité d'un modèle d'atmosphère à répondre correctement aux fluctuations de la TSO, et à indiquer quelles paramétrisations sont potentiellement à l'origine de défauts dans le modèle. Dans la deuxième partie de la thèse, nous avons mis en évidence les structures et les périodes où les variabilités océaniques et atmosphères sont maximales, à l'aide de différentes techniques d'analyse spectrale. Nous nous sommes ensuite focalisés sur les zones de fort gradient de la TSO (zones de front) afin d'étudier les caractéristiques des structures spatio-temporelles de la réponse atmosphérique liées aux fluctuations de ce front. Contrairement à la région équatoriale (ou on retrouve des résultats déjà évoqués dans des études antérieures), les deux fronts côtiers au large de l'Angola-Namibie et du Sénégal-Mauritanie ne montrent pas de signe de couplage actif avec l'atmosphère...|$|R

Improving {{the performance of}} an existing reactor or studying a new design requires modeling {{the flow of the}} different phases. Computational fluid dynamics can give an accurate a priori description of the velocity and concentration fields. However, this approach is too complicated in some cases (complicated geometry, random flow media, etc.), and this results in an abundance of information. A simpler approach relies on the theory of Residence Time Distribution (RTD), which is a theoretical interpretation framework for tracer experiments. This paper describes a software package that simulates hydrodynamic models derived from RTD experiments. The concept of RTD, introduced by Danckwerts in 1953, is briefly reviewed. Then tracer experiments, commonly used tracers and detectors are dealt with. Finally, the care required in tracer experiments is described in detail. Visual inspection of the tracer response makes it is possible to guess the main characteristics of the flow pattern, such as dead zones, bypasses or recirculations (see Fig. 4), which must be represented by the reactor geometry. Based on these observations and also on the knowledge of the reactor studied, the flow pattern can be modeled with an association of elementary units such as a perfect mixing-cell, plug-flow reactor, perfect mixing-cell in series and perfect mixing-cell in series with exchange to a dead zone. Fig. 2 gives the typical outlet responses of these four elementary units to an ideal inlet pulse of a tracer. Complicated flow patterns can generally be modeled by a network of properly interconnecting elementary units. The software needs to be fed only with the description of this network. Then it derives and solves the corresponding mass-balance equations in the Laplace domain. Finally, it gives the impulse or step response at any node of the network. A convolution with an experimental inlet curve can also be made, and some model parameters can be fitted so as to recover an experimental outlet response at a given node. Various studies carried out using this software package are described in this article in order to point out the possible utilisations : 1. An industrial crystalizer 2. A new membrane reactor for large-scale mammalian cell cultures 3. A waste-water treatment plant primary clarifier 4. A ventilation system in environment engineering 5. A concrete mixer in civil engineeringIn all these examples, good agreement between experimental and theoretical results was obtained. However, whatever the application, the agreement is meaningful only when : 1. The geometry of the flow system is effectively reflected {{in the structure of the}} network 2. Appropriate tracer experiments are performed in subparts of the flow system when numerous parameters have to be adjusted...|$|R

40|$|RÉSUMÉ: Le choix de poursuivre des études à la maîtrise coïncide avec une envie de consolider ma {{pratique}} d'écrivain. En effet, bien qu'ayant été formé comme psychosociologue, j'ai aussi depuis plusieurs années une pratique d'écriture, surtout poétique. J'avais au départ l'intuition qu'il y avait là un savoir-faire, mais surtout un savoir-être qui dépassait largement l'aptitude à la composition de textes, savoir qui tenait plus de l'art de vivre. C'est cette manière d'appréhender la vie que j'ai nommée La voie du poète, pour tenter de nommer cette voie qui m'est propre. A bien y réfléchir, il me semblait que j'abordais la vie comme j'aborde un poème à naître. Plus que cela encore, il me semblait que le poème lui-même participait à me créer. Cette manière d'envisager l'existence était autant vraie dans l'intimité de mon espace de création que dans l'espace partagé de ma salle de classe où j'œuvre en tant que chargé de cours. Tout cela m'apparaissait fort intéressant, mais difficilement saisissable par des concepts. J'ai décidé d'en faire l'objet de la présente recherche. L'intention de cette dernière est de comprendre en quoi et comment La voie du poète, telle que j'en fais l'expérience, participe à me construire et à me constituer en tant que sujet tout en influençant ma pratique d'écrivain, de chercheur et de formateur. D'inspiration phénoménologique et herméneutique, cette recherche s'inscrit dans un paradigme compréhensif et interprétatif. J'ai mené cette dernière avec l'intention de documenter mes processus et mes expériences de création, passés et présents. Par souci de cohérence, j'ai choisi de m'inspirer de la recherche-création (Gosselin, 2006; Laurier, 2004) pour mener ce projet. J'ai alors procédé à la production de mes données par le biais de journaux et <b>bilans</b> qui ont été analysés en mode d'écriture (Paillé et Mucchielli, 2012) tout au long de l'élaboration d'un récit poïétique (Valery, 1974; Cloutier, 2000), qui fut à la fois une méthodologie de production et d'analyse de données. En conclusion, cette démarche de recherche-création m'a permis d'observer, de comprendre et de décrire mon rapport à la création littéraire, et d'interroger ses influences sur le formateur, l'accompagnateur et le chercheur que je suis, {{en plus de}} me permettre de développer un regard critique autonome sur mon écriture et de consolider ma démarche d'écrivain.

[...] ABSTRACT: The {{choice of}} pursuing a Master's degree coincides with {{a strong desire to}} reflect and consolidate my own writing practice. In training as a psychosociologist, I have chosen to foster my apprenticeship through my writing, especially through the process of writing poetry. I initially had the intuition that my poetry writing process had a built-in knowledge system that far exceeded the simple ability of text composition, an ability that also seemed relevant to the art of living. This reflective process has brought to light what I consider my own way of the poet, away of being by which I am inclined to being poetically invested in my own existence. Throughout my reflective process, I realized that it wasn't only a question of approaching life as I approach the creative process of writing a poem, but also {{it seemed to me that}} the poem as I was writing it was in itself involved in creating me. This personal approach to living my poetic realm has shown me how it also impacts the realm of the classroom where I work as a training instructor. Though interesting, it was quite elusive in terms of conceptualising what was at play, therefore making it a good subject for this research. In that regard, the intent of this research has been to understand why and how what I name 'the way of the poet' impacts me as a whole person (as a poet, as a researcher and as a trainer) in accordance with the substance generated by my writing practice as an art form. Inspired by phenomenological hermeneutics, this research's footing is set in a comprehensive and interpretative paradigm and was carried forth with the intention of documenting simultaneously my past and present reflective and creative experiences. For better consistency, I chose to draw inspiration from the creative-research mind set as put forth by Gosselin (2006) and Laurier (2004). Data production was rendered through logs and reports in writing mode, (Paille and Mucchielli, 2012) in respect to a poïetics type narrative (Valery 1974; Cloutier 2000), which consequently served both as a means for the production of methodology and data analysis. In conclusion, this research-creation approach has allowed me to observe, understand and describe my own relationship to creative writing and in doing so, question how it influenced me as a pedagogue, a researcher and a coach therefore allowing me to develop a critical self-analysis of my writing output and my writing process.

40|$|Cet article s'intéresse à la dynamique du {{transfert}} du phosphore dans un bassin rural de la région lémanique, le bassin versant du Foron (51, 5 km 2). Nous montrons qu'en établissant, pour les périodes de tarissement, la relation concentration moyenne en phosphore - débit moyen à l'exutoire, il est possible d'évaluer globalement: 1) la rétention du P dans le réseau hydrographique lors de ces périodes; 2) la contribution moyenne des sources ponctuelles de P aux exportations du bassin. La rétention est un phénomène temporaire, mais c'est une étape clé de la dynamique du phosphore. Elle crée d'importants stocks de P dans le réseau hydrographique; ces stocks se situent pour l'essentiel {{au niveau}} des sédiments comme l'ont montré diverses études antérieures et sont exportés lors des crues. Les quantités stockées à l'issue de longs étiages dépassent souvent largement les exportations enregistrées pendant les plus fortes crues. La rétention s'accompagne d'une transformation partiellement irréversible de la spéciation du phosphore transféré. Ces phénomènes sont pris en compte pour établir des <b>bilans</b> annuels de pollution, et notamment la balance diffus - ponctuel. The effective management of phosphorus in watersheds requires {{knowledge of the}} origin and magnitude of phosphorus inputs. However, for large and complex watersheds, {{it is impossible to}} determine the phosphorus mass balances by measuring the flow from each source and the rate of transfer of phosphorus originating from upstream. Because of these difficulties, we have developed a strategy based on the measurement of phosphorus mass balances during base flow periods (with no storm-flow, which means with a constant or decreasing flow). This approach was applied to the Foron River watershed (drainage area 51. 5 km 2, annual average water discharge 0. 5 m 3 /s). The Foron River, a hillside stream with a torrential flow regime, is a tributary of Lac Léman (a large meso-eutrophic lake also known as Lake Geneva). Land use within the Foron watershed is diverse, with 50 % of the watershed area being in a naturally forested area (on steep upland slopes), 36 % in agricultural land lying on a gentle relief of moraine deposits (70 % permanent pasture and hay meadows, 30 % cereal grain crops) and 3 % in marshes. The population is scattered amongst four small villages, with an overall density of about 100 inhabitants per km 2. Stream flow in the river was continuously monitored and automatically sampled at the outlet from 1990 to 1993. Additional grab samples were taken at various locations, springs, agricultural sub-watersheds and brooks in the naturally forested area. Total suspended solids, soluble total phosphorus, orthophosphate and total phosphorus were determined according to standard methods. In addition, sampling was carried out to determine phosphorus stored in river sediments in places that are known to be temporary sinks for sediments. To validate the efficiency of the approach, we carried out a detailed study of the point sources and the sewage systems in the watershed. Only two-thirds of domestic wastewaters were processed in treatment plants. The minimum load of point source inputs was established to be about 60 kg total P per week and many point sources (that is to say discharged at discrete locations) remained unidentified (i. e., not all households were connected to sewers, farmsteads contributed for unknown quantities of total P). During base flow periods, phosphorus was predominantly soluble and orthophosphate was found throughout the hydrographic network. Particulate phosphorus and suspended matter concentrations were negligible (respectively 0. 8 m 3 /s, a constant P export regime was reached as all the inputs were transported to the outlet. Consequently, output at the outlet was equal to input into the river. This approach permits the calculation of the total point sources. Knowing the inputs from point sources and the total P export at the outlet, we can calculate the diffuse sources. Significant relationships between weekly mean total-P, soluble-P or orthophosphate concentrations at the outlet and weekly mean discharge were established to validate these observations. The best fit of these measured values didn't follow a standard law of dilution because the dilution effect was attenuated by the antagonist effect due to the increase in P transport inputs from sewage with increasing discharge. ([soluble P]= 0. 02 + 0. 148 Q- 1 / 2; n= 82; r 2 = 0. 8). During base flow when Q < 0. 8 m 3 /s, a portion of phosphorus inputs accumulated in the river biota and sediments through deposition, biological uptake and sorption. This accumulation may explain the higher levels of total-P and the easily exchangeable P in the sediments downstream of point source discharges. The efficiency of these storage processes depends not only on water discharge, but also (secondarily) on some characteristics of the antecedent hydrological conditions. We found that the amount stored increased significantly in the weeks following large storm-flows. We assumed that this indicated the effect of an intense exchange of the P loaded sediments with unsaturated sediments that were generated by erosion of natural upstream areas. As in-stream processes alter phosphorus speciation, a part of soluble-P becomes particulate. During storm-flows following base flow periods with a discharge lower than the limit discharge, the stored phosphorus was released from both particulate and soluble forms and exported. We calculated an annual mass balance of soluble phosphorus to evaluate the amount of particulate phosphorus exported at the outlet due to the transformation of phosphorus from soluble to particulate forms. The result obtained suggested that ¼ of particulate-P (1 t per year) resulted from this speciation change. To summarize, analyses of phosphorus mass balances during base flow could lead to a new procedure to evaluate the mean total mass of P originating from point sources, without referring to field surveys. In addition, this procedure allowed the quantification of both total-P storage as well as changes in speciation that occur during transfer of phosphorus in the hydrographic network...|$|R

Le bassin versant est constitué de terrains sédimentaires et volcaniques, avec une végétation steppique et aucune source de {{pollution}} organique. Le climat très variable présente d'une alternance de saisons humide et sèche. Le Rio Mauri fournit 90 % du flux de MES estimé à 6, 6. 106 t an- 1 (d'après GUYOT et al., 1990). Des analyses de COT et d'autres paramètres chimiques ont été réalisées sur 15 stations en 3 campagnes (fig. 2 et tableau 1). Une ACP (fig. 3) révèle une corrélation entre COT et MES, correspondant à deux épisodes de crues (déc. 87 et fév. 88) (tableau 2). Des hypothèses concernant l'origine du carbone organique et les flux sont avancées (tableau 3). Un flux de base, principalement du COD provenant du lac Titicaca, représenterait 18 000 t an- 1. Mais le COP, quoique fortement corrélé aux MES, n'a pas la même origine que celles-ci (fig. 4); il proviendrait principalement des zones connexes au Rio Desaguadero riches en végétation aquatique. La contribution de ces flux aux <b>bilans</b> du carbone organique paraît négligeable pour le lac Titicaca et peu importante pour le lac Poopo. Mais le maintien des interconnexions entre le Rio Desaguadero et ses zones humides doit être intégré dans les projets d'aménagement. The Rio Desaguadero is {{the outlet}} of Lake Titicaca and flows into Lake Poopo in the endorheic watershed of the Altiplano in Bolivia (alt. 3 650 m); its main tributary is the Rio Mauri (fig. 1). The transport of dissolved and suspended solids has been recently evaluated by GUYOT et al. (1990). The data on Total Organic Carbon {{obtained for the}} first time in this hydrosystem allow to complement this investigation with an estimation of the organic carbon transport. The Altiplano is a basin filed with tertiary and quaternary sediments. The Eastern cordillera is constituted of primary rocks; the Rio Mauri flow from a tertiary volcanic watershed. The climate is rather cold, semi-arid (700 to 400 mm yr- 1) and the vegetation is steppe-like with extensive pastures (sheep, lamas). The rainy season lasts from December to March. No direct pollution source can affect the TOC. The hydrology is very variable (see GUYOT et al., 1990). The base flow issues from Lake Titicaca and depends on the water level in the lake. The Total Suspended Solids (TSS) content is very high during floods. The annual flux of TSS is 6. 6 106 t yr- 1 at Ulloma, 90 % of transported sediment coming from the Rio Mauri. TOC was measured during 3 sampling series at 15 different stations (table 1). The 25 ml samples were acidified (pH 1) with H 3 PO 4 and sent to Lyon (France) to be analysed with a Dohrmann DC 80. In February 1988, Dissolved Organic Carbon was measured on filtered samples (Whatman GF/C decarbonated at 550 °C). The major elements were analysed in La Paz (Bolivia). Raw TOC data are presented (fig. 2), with a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for 9 parameters on all the samples (fig. 3). The first axis (52 % of total variance) is a scale of mineralization; it reveals a progressive concentration of dissolved elements in the Lake Poopo outlet (fig. 3 B first cluster). The mineralization of these samples seems to be inversely correlated to the discharge flowing from Lake Titicaca for the corresponding series. The second axis (23 % of total variance) shows a correlation between the TOC and the TSS (fig. 3 B, 4 th cluster). This correlation is obvious for the samples of Dec. 87 and Feb. 88 (table 2), when TSS concentrations are high due to flash floods of some effluents. Equation (1) gives the hast regression of TOC vs TSS. The organic Carbon transported is constituted of dissolved (DOC) or Particulate Organic Carbon (POC). Estimation presented for DOC and POC transport at the three gauging stations (table 3) are based on the following hypotheses :In the Rio Desaguadero, DOC concentrations seam relatively stable (fig. 2 D). Upstream of the Rio Mauri, the TOC transported at an average concentration of 11 mg. l- 1 is assumed to be mainly DOC flowing out from Lake Titicaca. DOC transport may constitute a relatively constant base flow of organic carbon. Estimation of POC transport is much more difficult. During floods from tributaries, the rise in TOC concentrations correlated with an increase of TSS seems to be essentially due to the POC. Following a classical method (MEYBECK, 1982), a non-linear regression of percentages of POC In TSS vs TSS was calculed (equation 2), using the samples with high TSS concentrations (fig. 4 A). Then, the POC fluxes were estimated using daily data of TSS for the gauging stations CA and UL. As most of the TSS come from the Rio Mauri results from this estimation that the flow rate of TOC from this stream would reach 7 t km- 2 yr- 1. But this value according to MEYBECK (1982) is close to the export of a tropical rainforest. Thus, this hypothesis of a POC transport directly linked to the TSS flux must be rejected. POC and TSS, although correlated, have distinct origins. This is shown by the tact that the percentages of POC in TSS in the samples used to calculate equation (2) are much higher than those given by MEYBECK (1982) for world rivers (fig. 4 B). A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the POC could come from Rio Desaguadero Borders and wetlands, often rich in aquatic vegetation, and very extensive in some places (especially upstream of Nazacara and downstream of Eucaliptus). This particulate carbon might be flushed into the mainstream during rainy periods, while at the same time TSS flow down from tributaries. Hypotheses on POC transport (table 3) in the Rio Desaguadero are thus based on a POC/TSS correlation (equation (2)) valid only for the mainstream, the contribution of Rio Mauri to the total flux being estimated on the basis of e TOC export rate of 0. 5 t km- 2 yr- 1. Contribution of these fluxes to organic carbon budgets seems to be negligible for Lake Titicaca, whose phytoplanctonic primary production is estimated at 4 106 t C yr- 1 (RICHERSON et al., 1977). When considering only the labile fraction of TOC (ITTEKOT, 1988), the readily matabolizable organic carbon input in Lake Poopo hydrosystem could be evaluated to 36 000 t yr- 1, corresponding to about 13 g C m- 2 yr- 1; that might be unimportant for this presumably highly productive lake system. In conclusion, these preliminary data lead to hypotheses which consider the Rio Desaguadero as a very particular hydrosystem in organic carbon transport. If most of the particulate carbon comes from margins, the necessity for maintaining interconnexions between the main Carmel and the wetlands fn future regulation projects must be emphasized...|$|R
