30|$|While the {{metabolic}} benefits of browning in humans {{remain to be}} fully established, safety is a concern that must first be addressed regarding any method used to induce browning. Cold exposure is a classic and efficient way to induce browning, but its obvious discomfort, together with risks of hypothermia, makes it impractical for clinical use. Therefore, <b>browning</b> <b>agents,</b> either endogenous or exogenous, provide an attractive alternative for improving metabolic diseases. Here we discuss a few commonly used <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> {{to draw attention to}} the safety concern of inducing WAT browning.|$|E
40|$|Igniting {{thermogenesis}} within white {{adipose tissue}} (i. e., promoting expression and {{activity of the}} uncoupling protein UCP 1) has attracted much interest. Numerous “browning agents” have now been described (gene ablations, transgenes, food components, drugs, environments, etc.). The implied action of <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> is that they increase UCP 1, through this heat production, leading to slimming. Here, we particularly point {{to the possibility that}} cause and effect may on occasion be the reverse: <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> may disrupt, for example, the fur, leading to increased heat loss, increased thermogenic demand to counteract this heat loss, and thus, through sympathetic nervous system activation, to enhanced UCP 1 expression in white (and brown) adipose tissues...|$|E
30|$|The {{induction}} of brown-like adipocyte {{development in}} white adipose tissue (WAT) confers numerous metabolic benefits by decreasing adiposity and increasing energy expenditure. Therefore, WAT browning has gained considerable attention for {{its potential to}} reverse obesity and its associated co-morbidities. However, this perspective has been tainted by recent studies identifying the detrimental effects of inducing WAT browning. This review aims to highlight the adverse outcomes of both overactive and underactive browning activity, the harmful side effects of <b>browning</b> <b>agents,</b> {{as well as the}} molecular brake-switch system that has been proposed to regulate this process. Developing novel strategies that both sustain the metabolic improvements of WAT browning and attenuate the related adverse side effects is therefore essential for unlocking the therapeutic potential of <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> in the treatment of metabolic diseases.|$|E

DC beef had higher pH (6. 6 vs 5. 7) and lower 24 h oxidation-reduction potential (– 190 vs – 108 mV) than controls, with higher cooked yield and cohesiveness, but lower beef flavor intensity scores. DC patties with lactic acid (LA) had acceptable cooked appearance and increased myoglobin (Mb) denaturation during cooking (77 %-LA; 63 %-normal control; 41 %-DC control), but a tangy off-flavor. Calcium peroxide increased Mb denaturation to 69 %, but caused excessive oxidation.

30|$|In {{recently}} years, {{significant progress}} has been made in identifying stimuli and signaling pathways that can induce browning of WAT and trigger adaptive thermogenesis. These advancements in knowledge have garnered great support in exploiting adipose tissue plasticity together with <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> as therapeutic tools for obesity, albeit with side effects as discussed above. The revelation of the two sides of the coin regarding the browning of WAT—namely, that it mitigates the metabolic consequences of obesity but propagates a hypermetabolic state in other pathologic conditions—suggests that browning “wastes energy” and thus is not a favorable physiological state. Therefore, we hypothesized that the body needs to tightly regulate this browning process via a “brake-switch” system to prevent the negative outcomes of both hyper- and hypo-activation of browning activity (Ferrannini et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{functional}} {{conversion of}} white adipose tissue (WAT) into a tissue with brown adipose tissue (BAT) -like activity, {{often referred to}} as “browning,” represents an intriguing strategy for combating obesity and metabolic disease. We demonstrate that thyroid hormone receptor (TR) activation by a synthetic agonist markedly induces a program of adaptive thermogenesis in subcutaneous WAT that coincides with a restoration of cold tolerance to cold-intolerant mice. Distinct from most other <b>browning</b> <b>agents,</b> pharmacological TR activation dissociates the browning of WAT from activation of classical BAT. TR agonism also induces the browning of white adipocytes in vitro, indicating that TR-mediated browning is cell autonomous. These data establish TR agonists as a class of browning agents, implicate the TRs in the browning of WAT, and suggest a profound pharmacological potential of this action...|$|E

30|$|Thyroid hormones (THs) T 4 (thyroxine) and T 3 (triiodothyronine) are key {{regulators}} of {{metabolism and}} energy homeostasis, {{and have been}} shown to induce WAT browning (Mullur et al. 2014). Low doses of the T 3 metabolite, triiodothyracetic acid (TRIAC), induced ectopic expression of UCP 1 in rat abdominal WAT (Medina-Gomez et al. 2008). Consistently, chronic administration of GC- 1, a thyroid hormone receptor β-specific agonist, to obese mice markedly increased browning of subcutaneous WAT with a significant increase in core body temperature and whole body energy expenditure (Lin et al. 2015). Similar safety concerns for the use of β 3 -AR agonists have been raised for THs in terms of heart risks, hyperthermia, and weight loss (Moolman 2002; Mullur et al. 2014). THs have also been linked to an increased risk of fractures in postmenopausal women with lower serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (Bauer et al. 2001), which directly affects bone turnover (Murphy and Williams 2004). This further emphasizes the need for <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> to be carefully designed and controlled in order to ensure its safe metabolic benefits.|$|E
40|$|A {{general picture}} of {{toxicological}} approach and practical aspects of cosmetic safety {{is described in}} this thesis. Such considerations are the basis for introducing negative and positive lists of cosmetic ingredients into cosmetic legislation. The first Dutch Cosmetic Act of 1968 already has several of these lists, but no analytical methods were given to control these lists. Therefore a study has been started with the aim to make analytical market surveys of several classes of potentially risk-bearing compounds. The analytical experience gained in the study {{can be used for}} the developments of official methods for the Dutch Cosmetic Act. The results of these market surveys can moreover be used as information on the actual use of risk-bearing compounds and will therefore contribute to the establishment of sound and significant cosmetic legislation in the Netherlands. Eye make-up colours were identified by a set of characteristic reactions. Lipstick colours were identified by wellknown chromategraphic methods. Colour intermediates for the oxidative hair colouring were identified by two-dimensional thin- layer chromatography. The aromatic amines were confirmed by direct gaschromatographic analysis which permitted quantitative determination. A separation of phenolic intermediates by means of gaschromatography is also described. Suntan preparations were analysed for the presence of UV-absorbers, <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> and local anesthesics. A simple aerosol sampling method, prior to gaschromatographic analysis was developed, thus permitting a total analysis of propellants and solvents in single-phase aerosols within an hour. Hormonal substances were detected in selected samples by chromatographic methods. These chemical findings supported the results of the biological assay for the detection of oestrogenic and androgenic activity of cosmetic products. Finally antimicrobial compounds were analysed in many kinds of cosmetic products, in which they were used for preservation or for its deodorizing, antidandruff or antiseptic actions. The diversity in chemical structure did not allow the development of universal methods, but most of the compounds could be identified and determined by chromatographic methods. Formaldehyde was determined by fluorometry. A study of the stability of formaldehyde releasing substances is presented. ...|$|E

Neither cooking-temperature profile nor cooking time {{was affected by}} hamburger fat content or pH. Double-side frying to 71. 1 °C internal temperature was adequate for more than 6 -log destruction of viable E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella at the geometrical center of extra lean and lean hamburgers. The coldest spot was on the circumferential surface, {{as indicated by the}} presence of a red ring of undenatured myoglobin, and confirmed by the finite-element temperature distribution model. The effect of pH (5. 80, 6. 29, 6. 73) on myoglobin denaturation in extra lean (3. 3 % fat) and lean (20. 0 % fat) hamburgers was studied. Compared to normal meat (pH= 5. 8), raw extra lean ground beef of pH = 6. 73 had significantly lower oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) value, lower concentration of metmyoglobin after 48 hr of refrigerated storage, and more distinct cherry-red color. Percent of myoglobin denaturation during cooking was affected mainly by pH and was not affected by total pigment or fat content of hamburgers. A pH ≥ 6. 5 and ORP ≤ - 200 mV were characteristic of dark-cutting beef In a third experiment, extra lean (3. 5 %) and lean (20. 0 %) beef patties were made from normal beef (pH= 5. 70) and dark-cutting beef (pH = 6. 60). Controls were made with no additives or with 1 % salt and 10 % added water. Various <b>browning</b> <b>agents</b> (1 % glucose, 0. 2 % caramel colorant, 0. 3 % calcium peroxide, or 2. 5 % encapsulated lactic acid) were added with 10 % water and 1 % salt. Salt had a pronounced prooxidant effect on myoglobin. Distinctive absorption peaks at 541 - 548 nm and 577 - 582 nm indicated that the undenatured pigment in cooked patties was oxymyoglobin. Dark-cutting patties had more rubbery texture and slightly perceptible off-flavor. Patties with lactic acid were less juicy and had lower intensity of beef flavor than other patties, and moderate intensity of sour off-flavor. Addition of salt and encapsulated lactic acid to beef patty formulation could solve the problem of hard-to-cook patties...|$|E

30|$|One {{significant}} limitation {{to the use}} of FGF 21 as a <b>browning</b> <b>agent</b> is {{the occurrence}} of severe bone loss. Wei et al. demonstrated that genetic Fgf 21 gain-of-function, as well as pharmacological FGF 21 treatment, in diet-induced obese mice reduced the number and area of osteoblasts and osteoclasts while increasing that of bone marrow adipocytes (Wei et al. 2012). In addition, chronic exposure to FGF 21 has been linked to growth retardation in mice based on the development of growth hormone (GH) resistance in Fgf 21 -transgenic mice (Inagaki et al. 2008). Overexpression of Fgf 21 has also been shown to cause infertility in female but not in male mice (Inagaki et al. 2007). Moreover, FGF 21 reduces physical activity and promotes torpor in Fgf 21 transgenic mice: a favorable adaptive response to starvation, but an undesirable outcome in the context of obesity (Inagaki et al. 2007). Hence, despite the beneficial effects of FGF 21 in terms of improving insulin resistance and inducing browning, its severe side effects will have to be overcome for long-term clinical administration.|$|R
