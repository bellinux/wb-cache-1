"I {{think they}} must {{teach you to}} pay {{compliments}} at Oxford, Philip," [...] she answered, flushing with pleasure, [...] "but it is all rubbish {{for you to say}} that I am pretty, because I know I am not"--and then, confidentially, glancing round to see that there was nobody within hearing (Hilda was engaged with a porter in looking after her things): [...] "Just look at my nose, and you will soon change your mind. It's broader, and flatter, and snubbier than ever. I consider that I have got a <b>bone</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>with</b> Providence about that nose. Ah! here comes Hilda. Isn't she lovely! There's beauty for you if you like. She hasn't got a nose. Come and show us to the carriage. You will come and lunch with us to-morrow, won't you?

'Life is short, and joys are fleeting,' as Aunt Chambers always says, so I mean to make the best of it whilst it lasts. I saw your father yesterday. He is a dear old man, though he has such awful eyes. I never felt so happy in my life as I do now. Good-bye. One o'clock." [...] And she was gone, leaving Philip with something to think about.|$|E

However, {{spotting}} the burning show afar behind CSS Alabama, the Captain of the Weathergauge out of Provincetown, Massachusetts figures {{that all is}} not right, and suddenly comes about, only to witness CSS Alabama change colors and fire a blank cartridge. The crew of CSS Alabama realize that wasting actual ammunition is not always necessary, given the ease of the Yankee surrenders. This time the prisoners are put off at Corvo Island, and CSS Alabama is off yet again, another sail having been spotted. After a thrilling all night chase, the new sail is found merely to be a Danish ship, and having no <b>bones</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>with</b> any of the world but Yankee vessels, Semmes lays off. The CSS Alabama returns to Corvo Island for the usual prisoner debarking, and the Weathergauge is put to the torch on September 10.|$|R

And with that he scrambled into the churn through the trap-door, and shut himself inside, just as the young woman's mother busted into the milk-house. 'The villain--where is he?' says she. 'I'll claw his face for'n, let me only catch him!' Well, she hunted about everywhere, ballyragging Jack by side and by seam, Jack lying a'most stifled inside the churn, and the poor maid--or young woman rather--standing at the door crying her eyes out. I shall never forget it, never! 'Twould have melted a marble stone! But she couldn't find him nowhere at all." ...|$|E

5000|$|Breitenbach's {{extensive}} use of humor in this work was a major departure from the mood of his early paintings, though social commentary is still present in Proverbidioms, for example in the sewer pipe running into the river, and the white female vs. black male representing [...] "I've got a <b>bone</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>with</b> you," [...] a reference to both the women's {{and the civil rights}} movements. Breitenbach further maintains that much is revealed about man’s nature through the literal painting of his expressions. Therefore, the artist did not shy away from placing wise expressions such as [...] "Don't put all your eggs in one basket", and [...] "Many hands make light work", alongside crude ones like, [...] "flat as a board" [...] and [...] "knockers". In 1980 the artist began publishing posters of this and other works. These became quite popular both for their entertainment value and for use in education.|$|E

The scene truly is a classic of the genre, and actress Carla Bonner proves herself a formidable performer from the knees down.

So, Kwong-Nam decides to help Mo-Lin attract the man she loves, whilst breaking Mo-Lin away from Windy's ridiculous concept of a feminist society. Kwong-Nam is also able to attain help from Fa-Lui for this case because Fa-Lui has a <b>bone</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>with</b> Windy as well. After multiple attempts, Wong Lung still rejects Mo-Lin and Mo-Lin is about ready to give up on love. At Windy's meet-and-greet, Windy urges Mo-Lin to announce her new single life to the world but Kwong-Nam appears, convincing her to admit that she does still love Wong Lung. With Kwong-Nam's setup, all of Mo-Lin's lady-lessons were recorded and Wong Lung was able to witness it all at a private theater, with Mo-Lin. He sees her diligence and persistence on screen but also admits that he likes her the way she was before the lady lessons.|$|E
