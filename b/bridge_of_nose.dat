Progressive tightening of the harness and increasing of the volume of air in the facemask cushions increased the pressure on the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nose,</b> and the effect of these two factors was additive. Some commercially available facemasks can produce substantial pressure on the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nose</b> and this explains why pressure complications on the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nose</b> are common during noninvasive ventilation...|$|R

Oral {{discoid lupus erythematosus}} results in oral lesions which present themselves as white spots, ulcers, and central erythema lesions. Oral discoid lesions most commonly occur on the labial mucosa, vermillion border and buccal mucosa. Atrophy may be observed in some cases.

5000|$|On August 11, 1945, {{five days}} after the Delegation for Poland officially dissolved, Moczarski was arrested by Ministry of State Security headed by Gen. Romkowski and put on {{political}} trial. On January 18, 1946 Moczarski was sentenced to 10 years in prison by a military court in Warsaw. Even though his penitentiary sentence was shortened to five years in February 1947, he was not released from the notorious Mokotów Prison upon his sentence’s fulfillment four years later. The darkest years of Stalinism in Poland were yet to come. Interrogated by Romkowski's subordinates from January 9, 1949 till June 6, 1951, Moczarski endured 49 different types of torture later described in his memoir.

40|$|Different head-and-neck {{positions}} (HNPs) {{are discussed}} in relation to potential welfare issues. To evaluate the effect on welfare, seven Royal Dutch Sport horses were studied in five predetermined HNPs: (1) unrestrained (HNP 1); (2) neck raised, <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>nose</b> around the vertical (HNP 2); (3) neck lowered and considerably flexed, <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>nose</b> pointing towards the chest (HNP 4); (4) neck raised and extended, <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>nose</b> {{in front of the}} vertical (HNP 5), and (5) neck lowered and flexed, <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>nose</b> pointing towards the carpus (HNP 7). A standardised exercise test (SET) of 34 min consisted of trot, canter and walk. Behaviour was recorded with a pre-defined ethogram and R-R intervals measured using telemetry. Cortisol concentrations were taken at the start, 5 and 30 min after the SET. Behaviour around the SET was scored separately. Conflict behaviours increased significantly during HNP 2 when compared with HNP 1, HNP 4 and HNP 7 during the SET, and there was significant negative anticipation before HNP 2 and HNP 7. The heart rate variability (HRV) frequency domain for HNP 2 showed a significantly increased low frequency peak (LFpeak) compared with other HNPs, and there was a decrease in very low frequency (VLF%) compared with HNP 1. HNP 4 showed a significant increase in LF% and decrease in VLF% compared with HNP 1. Saliva cortisol concentrations were significantly increased in HNP 2 at 5 and 30 min after exercise. Increased conflict behaviour was mostly observed in HNP 2, but there was a raised HRV suggesting a sympathetic shift in HNP 2 and HNP 4, and increased cortisol concentrations during HNP 2 indicated a stress response...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, the welfare {{implications}} of certain training techniques used in the horse industry have gained more attention from the general public. In Warmblood performance horses, this concern {{is focused on the}} use of a hyperflexed head and neck position, also named “rollkur”. The aim of this thesis is to measure the effect of 5 different head and neck positions on the equine athlete, in this study represented by the base level trained dressage horse. The first part of this thesis concerns an ex vivo study describing the use of contrast CT and MRI to visualize equine cervical spine anatomy and measure the ex vivo effect of flexion and extension on intervertebral foramina dimensions. The ex vivo part is followed by an in vivo study, measuring the effect {{of the head and neck}} position on three clinical areas, all influencing equine welfare: 1. The effect on neuromuscular functionality; 2. The effect on upper airway functionality and 3. The effect on indicators of stress. The head and neck positions were defined as follows: HNP 1 -Unrestrained (control), HNP 2 -Neck raised, <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>nose</b> around the vertical. HNP 4 -Neck lowered and considerably flexed, <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>nose</b> pointing towards the chest. HNP 5 -Neck raised and considerably extended, <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>nose</b> in front of the vertical. HNP 7 -Neck lowered and flexed, <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>nose</b> pointing towards the carpus. Seven base level trained dressage horses were accustomed to the different positions for at least 3 weeks, before the start of the study. During the actual study, the horses were exercised on the lunge in an exercise protocol consisting of trot(1) (10 min), canter (4 min), trot(2) (5 min) and walk (5 min). Neuromuscular transmission was measured with quantitative (SF) EMG and muscle enzyme concentrations and indicated an effect of every head and neck position compared with HNP 1, but the most significant effect was seen in HNP 4. Upper airway functionality was measured with an esophageal pressure balloon and arterial blood gas values. This study again demonstrated an effect in each position compared with HNP 1, but an inspiratory upper airway obstruction developed in HNP 4, without an effect on arterial blood gas values. Behavioural observations, blood and saliva cortisol concentrations and heart rate variability were measured as indicators of stress, which demonstrated more conflict behaviour in the extended positions (HNP 2 and HNP 5). This thesis significantly contributes to the understanding of the effect of different head and neck positions on the equine athlete. Based on the results of this study, it might be argued that if the use of a flexed position is desired, HNP 7 may be preferable over HNP 4 in the base level trained dressage horse...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION One in fifty {{children}} is born with significant congenital abnormality [1]. Some have multiple anomalies constituting a specific dysmorphic syndrome. Of 5, 000 or so dysmorphic syndromes, over 700 involve dental, oral or craniofacial differences. Dysmorphic craniofacial features include extended distance between eyes (telecanthus) or pupils (hypertelorism); inner/outer eye corners {{at different levels}} (sloping palpebral fissures); unusual nose width (interalar distance), <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>nose,</b> skull shape or position/orientation of ears; occurrence of skin folds; and, drooping eyelids (ptosis). Syndrome diagnosis is based on clinical observation of abnormal body parts and proportions, and unusual appearance.
