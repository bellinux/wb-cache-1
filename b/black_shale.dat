40|$|Lower Cretaceous <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> {{in coastal}} southeastern China are of {{significance}} to the geological study of the Tethys and Pacific realms and to hydrocarbon exploration of southeastern China and East China Sea. However, the stratigraphic correlation, distribution patterns and hydrocarbon potential of the <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> have not been well constrained so far. In this study, the zircon U–Pb ages, organic petrologic and geochemical analyses were performed for representative outcrop sections in the region. Zircon U–Pb ages demonstrate that the Lower Cretaceous <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> in coastal southeastern China {{can be divided into}} two regional-scale sets. The first set was deposited during the early stage of the Early Cretaceous (K 11, Berriasian–Hauterivian). The second set was deposited during the late stage of the Early Cretaceous (K 12), and might extend to the Taiwan Strait. Detailed organic geochemical analyses including organic matter abundance, type and maturity of the Lower Cretaceous <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> demonstrate that the organic matter abundance of the sources reached medium to good quality by the hydrocarbon source rock standards, and the average TOC values and the chloroform bitumen “A” of the K 11 <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> are higher. The type of organic matter is mainly type III, type II can also be found from the K 12 <b>black</b> <b>shales.</b> The thermal maturity of most samples is high to overmature. A relatively comprehensive hydrocarbon resource evaluation indicates that favorable regions are in the northern Guangdong Province for the K 11 and in the coastal region of Zhejiang Province and the western Fujian Province for the K 12. Sedimentology studies on the Shipu section for the K 11 <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> illuminated that the K 12 <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> in coastal southeastern China were mainly deposited during transgressive period.

40|$|AbstractThe Duwi Formation in the Quseir-Safaga area is {{conformably}} overlain by the Quseir variegated shales and underlain by the Dakhla shales. Detailed mineralogical and geochemical {{studies were}} carried out on the middle member of the <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> of the Duwi Formation in Quseir-Safaga province to infer their source rocks, paleo-weathering and provenance of the sources. The studied <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> are highly fossiliferous and fissile. They are texturally classified as phosphatic marly mudstone microfacies. Mineralogically, they are composed mainly of calcite, apatite, quartz, pyrite and clay minerals. The studied clay fraction reveals that the well-crystalline Na-montmorillonite is the dominating clay mineral with mixed layer montmorillonite-illite and minor kaolinite. These shales {{could be used as a}} source for the sodium bentonite. The studied <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> are highly mature, detrital and authigenic in origin. They are most probably derived from basic volcanic rocks by intensive chemical weathering. The provenance constituted a part of passive and active continental margins similar to those the Devonian/Mississippian shales in USA. The Cretaceous <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> of the Duwi Formation in Quseir-Safaga area are part of Mes-Neoarchean Shales, and are typically comparable to the Archean Shale Average. The average values of Cu, Ni, Zn, Cr, V, As and Se and, with the ratios Rb/Sr and Cr/Ni, are enriched with respect to those of the PAAS values. This could be attributed to the abundance of mafic components. The felsic source rocks were considered as an added source similar to Cretaceous and Cambrian <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> in India and China; respectively. The ratios V/Cr, V/(V+Ni) and Mo/Al and the high concentrations of the redox sensitive elements revealed that the studied <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> were deposited under relatively euxinic to anoxic reducing marine environments coupled with hydrothermal solutions. They were found comparable to the Cretaceous Gulf of California, Posidonia, Cretaceous/Tertiary <b>black</b> <b>shales,</b> and those in the Black Sea.

40|$|The Utica <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> were {{deposited}} in the Taconic Foreland basin ∼ 420 Ma ago. The organic matter in these shales is of marine origin and the timing of deposition of these shales has been constrained by graptolite biostratigraphy and bentonite chronostratigraphy.

40|$|A {{comparison}} between the biotic signal recorded in the Tethyan Cenomanian <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> and in the Mediterranean Pleistocene sapropels is proposed here. To this end the Antruiles section (northeastern Dolomites, Italy) has been investigated as a reference section for the Cenomanian <b>black</b> <b>shales.</b> The data obtained, based oncalcareous nannofossils and foraminifera, have been compared to those from a core in the Mediterranean Sea containing a complete succession of Late Pleistocene^Holocene sapropels. Our study suggests that deposition of <b>black</b> <b>shales,</b> like sapropels, occurred when the water column was stratified, as implied by increased abundance of the Cenomanian deeper-dwellers Rotalipora cushmani and R. greenhornensis. The superficial/subsuperficial opportunist form Heterohelix reussi, which strongly increases in numbers within the <b>black</b> <b>shales,</b> could be analogous to the modern surface-dweller Globigerinoides ruber, which is abundant in Late Pleistocene^Holocene Mediterranean sapropels. The peaks of G. ruber {{can be related to}} decreased salinity in surface water, thus the increase of H. reussi could also be related to a freshwater superficial layer. We hypothesise also that an increase in abundance of Watznaueria barnesae reflects conditions of superficial low salinity. In <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> increases in abundance of Dicarinella algeriana and Praeglobotruncana gibba, by analogy to modern Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, could reflect availability of food restricted to subsuperficial waters. However, a Cretaceus equivalent of the Pleistocene nannoplankton form Florisphaera profunda, which proliferates within the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum, is not observed. In addition, the abundance of H. reussi indicates a well-expanded oxygen minimum zone, although less in extent than in Pleistocene sapropels, as shown by the occurrence within the Cenomanian <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> of a benthic fauna, even though reduced in size and impoverished. Spectral analysis applied to calcareous nannofossils identifies close relations with the Milankovitch precession and eccentricity cycles in both the <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> and the sapropels...|$|R

40|$|Three {{pairs of}} Upper Cretaceous <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> and {{adjacent}} green claystones from Hole 53 OA were analyzed to com-pare types and amounts {{of organic matter}} and lipids and to seek information about their environments of deposition. The organic-carbon-rich <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> have C/N ratios nearly seven times those of the organic-carbon-lean green clay-stones. The lipid content of organic matter in the <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> is about ten times less than in adjacent green layers. Or-ganic matter in both types of rocks is thermally immature, and distributions of alkanoic acids, alkanols, sterols, and al-kanes contain large amounts of terrigenous components. Pristane/phytane ratios of less than one suggest that younger Turonian sediments were laid down under anoxic conditions, but ratios greater than one suggest that older Turonian Cenomanian deposits accumulated in a more oxic environment. Closely bedded green and black layers have very similar types of lipid distributions and differ primarily in concentrations, although <b>black</b> <b>shales</b> contain somewhat larger amounts of terrigenous lipid components. Geochemical and stratigraphic evidence suggests much of the organic matter in these samples originated on the African continental margin and was transported to the Angola Basin by turbidity flow.
