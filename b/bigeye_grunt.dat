50|$|The <b>bigeye</b> <b>grunt,</b> Brachydeuterus auritus, is {{a species}} of grunt native to the Atlantic coast of Africa from Morocco to Angola, where it occurs at depths from 10 to 100 m (mostly between 15 and 80 m). This species inhabits areas with sandy or muddy substrates, {{remaining}} near the bottom {{during the day and}} moving into more open waters at night to feed. This species grows to 30 cm in TL and is highly important as a commercial food fish. It is the only known member of its genus.|$|E
40|$|Aspects of {{the feeding}} habits and diet of juveniles of the cassava croaker Pseudotolithus senegalensis (Valenciennes, 1833) (Sciaenidae) and <b>bigeye</b> <b>grunt</b> Brachydeuterus auritus (Valenciennes, 1831) (Haemulidae) in the inshore waters of Cape Coast, Ghana are {{reported}} in the study. Both species had a similar diet consisting of larvae of fish, shrimps and cuttlefish. The croaker ingested prey up to 77 % of its total length while the <b>bigeye</b> <b>grunt</b> consumed prey up to 70 % of its total length. Analysis of the stomach contents, based on the frequency of occurrence, and numerical and gravimetric compositions of these food items indicated that shrimps were the main food of P. senegalensis while B. auritus fed mainly on fish. While shrimps constituted the predominant food of the croakers all-year-round, the bigeye grunts appeared to shift their preference for fish to shrimps from June to September. The {{results of the study}} are compared with those on croakers {{from other parts of the}} Gulf of Guinea. The study, however, appears to be the first to give a detailed account of the food preference and feeding ecology of the <b>bigeye</b> <b>grunt...</b>|$|E
