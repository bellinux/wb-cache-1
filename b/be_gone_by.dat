25|$|Carpenter {{finally gave}} up and in 1961 sold the stadium for $600,000 {{to a group of}} New York real estate investors, losing over a million dollars after his 7-year ownership; he secured a 3-year lease and an option to stay through 1967 while he pursued his Torresdale stadium plan. The New York buyers quickly flipped the {{property}} to another New York consortium who, assuming the Phillies would <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> 1967, began planning the demolition of the stadium and construction of a bowling alley and discount store on the site. Then in May 1964, Jerry Wolman, who had just bought the Philadelphia Eagles in February, brought the stadium ownership back to town, paying $757,000 for it {{as part of a larger}} real estate deal. Wolman's motivations for the purchase are in dispute – all the mortgage shuffling did not slow the decay out at the park – but he claimed he wanted to help the Phillies; the move also put him at the very center of the emerging fight over a new stadium in Philadelphia, which would likely affect his Eagles.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, the U.S. Geological Survey began a more {{systematic}} {{study of the}} remaining glaciers, which has continued to the present day. By 2010, 37 glaciers remained, but only 25 of these {{were considered to be}} [...] "active glaciers" [...] of at least [...] in area. The National Park Service warns that if the current warming trend continues, the park's remaining glaciers will <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> 2030. This glacier retreat follows a worldwide pattern that has accelerated even more since 1980. Without a major climatic change in which cooler and moister weather returns and persists, the mass balance, which is the accumulation rate versus the ablation (melting) rate of glaciers, will continue to be negative and the glaciers have been projected to eventually disappear, leaving behind only barren rock.|$|E
500|$|According to Ronald D. Moore, Roddenberry [...] "felt very {{strongly}} that contemporary Earth religions would <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> the 23rd century". Brannon Braga said that Roddenberry made it known to the writers of Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation that religion, superstition, and mystical thinking {{were not to be}} included. Even a mention of marriage in a script for an early episode of The Next Generation resulted in Roddenberry's chastising the writers. Nicholas Meyer said that Star Trek had evolved [...] "into sort of a secular parallel to the Catholic Mass". Roddenberry compared the franchise to his own philosophy by saying: [...] "Understand that Star Trek is more than just my political philosophy, my racial philosophy, my overview on life and the human condition." [...] He was awarded the 1991 Humanist Arts Award from the American Humanist Association.|$|E

500|$|The shoot {{involved}} the actress, director, and {{a crew of}} two traveling 27,977 miles in 13 days. [...] The young woman was portrayed by Lindsay Burdge, who would years later become known for lead roles in several independent films such as A Teacher and The Sideways Light. [...] On his directing, Stewart-Ahn said [...] "The goal was absolute realism; nothing was staged." [...] Much of the film was shot on camcorder, including a Panasonic AG-HVX200 and a consumer-grade Canon HV30, so as to blend in by looking like tourists. [...] He noted that the trip to Hokkaido was taken on a whim, and during the trip the team realized that daylight would <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> the time they would reach their intended destination, so they exited the train at Asari and took {{what would become the}} final shot of the video there.|$|E
500|$|Following her civil trial, Hutchinson was {{put under}} house arrest and ordered to <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> {{the end of the}} {{following}} March. [...] In the interim, she was not allowed to return home, but was detained at the house of Joseph Weld, brother of the Reverend Thomas Weld, located in Roxbury, about two miles from her home in Boston. The distance was not great, yet Hutchinson was rarely able to see her children because of the weather, which was particularly harsh that winter. Winthrop referred to Hutchinson as [...] "the prisoner" [...] and was determined to keep her isolated so that others would not be inspired by her, according to LaPlante. She was frequently visited by various ministers, whose intent, according to LaPlante, was to reform her thinking but also to collect evidence against her. [...] Thomas Shepard was there to [...] "collect errors", and concluded that she was a dangerous woman. [...] Shepard and the other ministers who visited her drew up a list of her theological errors and presented them to the Boston church, which decided that she should stand trial for these views.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times Patrick Healy {{stated in}} February 2011 that Spider-Man had become [...] "a {{national}} object {{of pop culture}} fascination—more so, perhaps, than any show in Broadway history" [...] due to media coverage and late-night comedians' monologues on the musical's many delays, injuries, and creative issues. He speculated that the musical would not have staying power through repeat viewings like other hit musicals, after [...] "tourists and parents with children" [...] watched it for [...] "bragging rights at dinner parties or on the playground". The New York Post columnist Michael Riedel opined that month that the musical would be short-lived: [...] "Depending on how much more money its backers are willing to lose, my hunch is that 'Spider-Man' will stagger through the spring, pick up with the tourist traffic {{in the summer and}} then collapse in the fall. It should <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> September [...]" ...|$|E
