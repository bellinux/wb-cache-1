6000|$|He had {{the cabin}} {{arranged}} {{in accordance with}} his simple ideal of comfort at sea. A big bookcase (he was a great reader) occupied {{one side of his}} stateroom; the portrait of his late wife, a flat bituminous oil-painting representing the profile and one long <b>black</b> <b>ringlet</b> of a young woman, faced his bed-place. Three chronometers ticked him to sleep and greeted him on waking with the tiny competition of their beats. He rose at five every day. The officer of the morning watch, drinking his early cup of coffee aft by the wheel, would hear through the wide orifice of the copper ventilators all the splashings, blowings, and splutterings of his captain's toilet. These noises would be followed by a sustained deep murmur of the Lord's Prayer recited in a loud earnest voice. Five minutes afterwards the head and shoulders of Captain Whalley emerged out of the companion-hatchway. Invariably he paused for a while on the stairs, looking all round at the horizon; upwards at the trim of the sails; inhaling deep draughts of the fresh air. Only then he would step out on the poop, acknowledging the hand raised to the peak of the cap with a majestic and benign [...] "Good morning to you." [...] He walked the deck till eight scrupulously. Sometimes, not above twice a year, he had to use a thick cudgel-like stick on account of a stiffness in the hip--a slight touch of rheumatism, he supposed. Otherwise he knew nothing of the ills of the flesh. At the ringing of the breakfast bell he went below to feed his canaries, wind up the chronometers, and take the head of the table. From there he had before his eyes the big carbon photographs of his daughter, her husband, and two fat-legged babies --his grandchildren--set in black frames into the maplewood bulkheads of the cuddy. After breakfast he dusted the glass over these portraits himself with a cloth, and brushed the oil painting of his wife with a plumate kept suspended from a small brass hook {{by the side of the}} heavy gold frame. Then with the door of his stateroom shut, he would sit down on the couch under the portrait to read a chapter out of a thick pocket Bible--her Bible. But on some days he only sat there for half an hour with his finger between the leaves and the closed book resting on his knees. Perhaps he had remembered suddenly how fond of boat-sailing she used to be.|$|E

6000|$|... "Anna who?" [...] says my wife; and {{she might}} well be mistaken: for this person had a hat and feathers, a bare neck and arms, great <b>black</b> <b>ringlets,</b> and a little calico frock, which {{came down to the}} knees.|$|R
60|$|Clive Newcome was {{not looking}} at Barnes. His eyes were fixed upon the lady seated {{not far from the}} lecturer--upon Ethel, with her arm round her little niece's shoulder, and her thick <b>black</b> <b>ringlets</b> {{drooping}} down over a face paler than Clive's own.|$|R

50|$|Butler's ringlet is {{visually}} {{similar to}} the <b>black</b> mountain <b>ringlet,</b> Percnodaimon pluto. The two species may be differentiated by where the individual in question is sighted. Butler's ringlet prefers to fly over vegetation, settling among snow-tussock, subalpine shrubs and herbaceous flowers, whereas the <b>black</b> mountain <b>ringlet</b> tends to congregate over rock and scree.|$|R

Georgiana, the eldest, with her <b>black</b> <b>ringlets,</b> her {{flashing}} eyes, her noble aquiline profile, her swan-like neck, and sloping shoulders, was orientally dazzling; and the twins, with their delicately turned-up noses, their blue eyes, and chestnut hair, were an identical pair of ravishingly English charmers.|$|R
6000|$|As it was, Queeker {{thought her}} [...] "desperately love-able," [...] {{and in his}} perplexity {{continued}} to write sonnets without number to the moon, in which efforts, however, he was singularly unsuccessful, owing to the fact that, after he had gazed {{at it for a}} considerable length of time, the orb of night invariably adopted <b>black</b> <b>ringlets</b> and a bright sunny complexion.|$|R
60|$|As Mr. Joseph Tuggs did not {{precisely}} {{understand what the}} grand tour was, or how such an article was manufactured, he replied, ‘Of course.’ Just as he said the word, there came tripping up, from her seat at {{the stern of the}} vessel, a young lady in a puce-coloured silk cloak, and boots of the same; with long <b>black</b> <b>ringlets,</b> large <b>black</b> eyes, brief petticoats, and unexceptionable ankles.|$|R
50|$|Adults are pale cinereous fawn, the {{forewings}} {{are slightly}} and minutely speckled with black, {{with a large}} purplish blackish patch which occupies the exterior border {{with the exception of}} the tip, and contains some pale marginal points.

60|$|As far as person went, she {{answered}} point for point, both to my picture and Mrs. Fairfax's description. The noble bust, the sloping shoulders, the graceful neck, the {{dark eyes and}} <b>black</b> <b>ringlets</b> were all there;--but her face? Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride. It was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her laugh was satirical, {{and so was the}} habitual expression of her arched and haughty lip.|$|R
60|$|But {{it was a}} {{consolation}} to see {{her when}} she walked out with a French maid, a couple of children, and a little dog hanging on to her by a blue ribbon. She always held down her head then--her head with the drooping <b>black</b> <b>ringlets.</b> The virtuous and well-disposed avoided her. I have seen the Square-keeper himself look puzzled as she passed; and Lady Kicklebury walking by with Miss K., her daughter, turn away from Mrs. Stafford Molyneux, and fling back at her a ruthless Parthian glance that ought to have killed any woman of decent sensibility.|$|R

6000|$|A Vision {{of beauty}} now breaks upon the scene! This vision is tall, graceful, and {{commanding}} in figure. It has long <b>black</b> <b>ringlets,</b> piercing <b>black</b> eyes, a fair delicate skin, and a bewitching smile that displays a row of--of [...] "pearls!" [...] The vision is about sixteen years of age, and {{answers to the}} romantic name of Flora Macdonald. It is sister to that stalwart Hector who first showed Mr Sudberry how to fish; and stately, sedate, and beautiful does it appear, as, leaning on its brother's arm, it ascends the hill towards the White House, where extensive preparations are being made for a picnic.|$|R
60|$|That {{pretty little}} house, {{the last in}} Pocklington Square, was lately {{occupied}} by a young widow lady who wore a pink bonnet, a short silk dress, sustained by a crinoline, and a light blue mantle, or over-jacket (Miss C. is not here {{to tell me the}} name of the garment); or else a black velvet pelisse, a yellow shawl, and a white bonnet; or else--but never mind the dress, which seemed to be of the handsomest sort money could buy--and who had very long glossy <b>black</b> <b>ringlets,</b> and a peculiarly brilliant complexion,--No. 96, Pocklington Square, I say, was lately occupied by a widow lady named Mrs. Stafford Molyneux.|$|R
5000|$|Percnodaimon is a {{monotypic}} genus of satyrid butterflies in {{the family}} Nymphalidae. Its sole species, Percnodaimon merula, the <b>black</b> mountain <b>ringlet,</b> is endemic to New Zealand. Its Māori name is pepe pouri, which means [...] "dark moth".|$|R
60|$|Elvira joined in; so did Stubbs, {{with a good}} ear and voice, but an {{imperfect}} acquaintance with the music. Leon and the guitar were equal to the situation. The actor dispensed his throat-notes with prodigality and enthusiasm; and, as he looked up to heaven in his heroic way, tossing the <b>black</b> <b>ringlets,</b> {{it seemed to him}} that the very stars contributed a dumb applause to his efforts, and the universe lent him its silence for a chorus. That is one of the best features of the heavenly bodies, that they belong to everybody in particular; and a man like Leon, a chronic Endymion who managed to get along without encouragement, is always the world's centre for himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who is {{that man}} with the blue ribbon and the three-pointed star?" [...] asked Pen. A gentleman in <b>black</b> with <b>ringlets</b> and a tuft stood gazing {{fiercely}} about him, with one hand in the arm-hole of his waistcoat and the other holding his claque.|$|R
50|$|The adult female <b>black</b> {{mountain}} <b>ringlet</b> deposits {{her eggs}} atop stones on the alpine slopes. When {{the sun is}} out it heats these stone's exposed surface, acting as an incubator for the eggs. This behaviour is unique among New Zealand butterflies and is only seen {{in a handful of}} butterfly species occupying the Himalayas and European Alps.|$|R
6000|$|There on his table, his sister's letter lay {{reproaching}} him. He took it up, ashamed rather of his negligence regarding it, {{and prepared}} {{himself for a}} disagreeable hour's communing with that crabbed-handed absent relative. [...] . It {{may have been an}} hour after the Major's departure from the Colonel's house--Sir Michael was sleeping the sleep of the just; Glorvina had arranged her <b>black</b> <b>ringlets</b> in the innumerable little bits of paper, in which it was her habit to confine them; Lady O'Dowd, too, had gone to her bed in the nuptial chamber, on the ground-floor, and had tucked her musquito curtains round her fair form, when the guard at the gates of the Commanding-Officer's compound beheld Major Dobbin, in the moonlight, rushing towards the house with a swift step and a very agitated countenance, and he passed the sentinel and went up to the windows of the Colonel's bedchamber.|$|R
50|$|Not much {{research}} has been conducted on the <b>black</b> mountain <b>ringlet,</b> and although {{it is one of the}} few endemic species of butterfly New Zealand has, it is still a field where more can be learned from. Because they inhabit the intrepid Southern Alps, it is difficult to predict the exact distribution, but it is believed that they can be found through the mountain range.|$|R
50|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the butterfly}} also {{plays an important}} physiological role. Its dark wings coupled with its large surface area acts as a black body, and absorbs the electromagnetic energy from the sun's rays. By absorbing and storing heat, {{the wings of the}} <b>black</b> mountain <b>ringlet</b> butterfly essentially act like solar panels. This is another adaptation evolved for survival in the frosty conditions of the Southern Alps.|$|R
50|$|Larval colours {{can vary}} from dull grey to brown, but contain black {{anterior}} setae. The <b>black</b> mountain <b>ringlet</b> larvae have five instars which take about a month each in pleasant summer temperatures, but {{can take up to}} eight months if it occurs over winter. For this reason the butterfly can stay in its larval stage for up to two years and can be found almost year round in an instar stage.|$|R
60|$|Fancy, then, {{in lieu of}} the conversation, a scoundrel, {{disappointed}} and in a fury, wreaking his brutal revenge upon an amiable woman, who sits trembling and pale, and wondering at this sudden exhibition of wrath. Fancy how he clenches his fists and stands over her, and stamps and screams out curses with a livid face, growing wilder and wilder in his rage; wrenching her hand when she wants to turn away, and only stopping at last when she has fallen off the chair in a fainting fit, with a heart-breaking sob that made the Jew-boy who was listening at the key-hole turn quite pale and walk away. Well, it is best, perhaps, that such a conversation should not be told at length:--at the end of it, when Mr. Walker had his wife lifeless on the floor, he seized a water-jug and poured it over her; which operation pretty soon brought her to herself, and shaking her <b>black</b> <b>ringlets,</b> she looked up once more again timidly into his face, and took his hand, and began to cry.|$|R
60|$|Though Mr. Jubber presented, to all appearance, {{the most}} scoundrelly aspect that {{humanity}} can assume, {{when he was}} clothed in his evening uniform, and illuminated by his own circus lamplight, he nevertheless reached an infinitely loftier climax of blackguard perfection when he was arrayed in his private costume, and was submitted to the tremendous ordeal of pure daylight. The most monstrous ape that could be picked from the cages of the Zoological Gardens would have gained by comparison {{with him as he}} now appeared, standing in the Rectory cloak-room, with his debauched bloodshot eyes staring grimly contemptuous all about him, with his yellow flabby throat exposed by a turn-down collar and a light blue neck-tie, with the rouge still smeared over his gross unhealthy cheeks, with his mangy shirt-front bespattered with bad embroidery and false jewelry that had not even the politic decency to keep itself clean. He had his hat on, and was sulkily running his dirty fingers through the greasy <b>black</b> <b>ringlets</b> that flowed over his coat-collar, when Doctor Joyce entered the cloak-room.|$|R
50|$|Hypocysta angustata, the <b>black</b> {{and white}} <b>ringlet</b> or pied ringlet, is {{a species of}} {{butterfly}} of the family Nymphalidae. It is found on the Cape York Peninsula in Australia and in the rainforests of New Guinea.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of {{pupation}} the <b>black</b> mountain <b>ringlet</b> turns grey with brown speckles to match the surrounding stones. During the actual process however, the butterfly has another interesting strategy; the pupae suspend themselves horizontally (unlike most butterflies) against the under surface of a rock and hold themselves to the surface by a cremaster, a hook shaped protuberance near the abdominal area. Pupae have been found up to 3 {{feet away from the}} nearest food plant and emerge as adult butterflies emerge 2 to 3 weeks later.|$|R
60|$|He was {{a little}} elderly man, with a clammy cold right hand, from which even rabbits and birds could not remove the smell of shaving-soap. Poll had {{something}} of the bird in his nature; not of the hawk or eagle, but of the sparrow, that builds in chimney-stacks and inclines to human company. He was not quarrelsome, though, like the sparrow; but peaceful, like the dove. In his walk he strutted; and, in this respect, he bore a faint resemblance to the pigeon, {{as well as in}} a certain prosiness of speech, which might, in its monotony, be likened to the cooing of that bird. He was very inquisitive; and when he stood at his shop-door in the evening-tide, watching the neighbours, with his head on one side, and his eye cocked knowingly, there was a dash of the raven in him. Yet there was no more wickedness in Poll than in a robin. Happily, too, when any of his ornithological properties {{were on the verge of}} going too far, they were quenched, dissolved, melted down, and neutralised in the barber; just as his bald head--otherwise, as the head of a shaved magpie--lost itself in a wig of curly <b>black</b> <b>ringlets,</b> parted on one side, and cut away almost to the crown, to indicate immense capacity of intellect.|$|R
60|$|With their handsome, bronzed, lean faces, shiny <b>black</b> <b>ringlets,</b> glistening eyes, broad-chested, bearded, {{sometimes}} a tiny gold {{ring in the}} lobe of the ear, the aristocracy of the railway works listened to him, turning away from their cards or dominoes. Here and there a fair-haired Basque studied his hand meantime, waiting without protest. No native of Costaguana intruded there. This was the Italian stronghold. Even the Sulaco policemen on a night patrol let their horses pace softly by, bending low in the saddle to glance {{through the window at}} the heads in a fog of smoke; and the drone of old Giorgio's declamatory narrative seemed to sink behind them into the plain. Only now and then the assistant of the chief of police, some broad-faced, brown little gentleman, {{with a great deal of}} Indian in him, would put in an appearance. Leaving his man outside with the horses he advanced with a confident, sly smile, and without a word up to the long trestle table. He pointed to one of the bottles on the shelf; Giorgio, thrusting his pipe into his mouth abruptly, served him in person. Nothing would be heard but the slight jingle of the spurs. His glass emptied, he would take a leisurely, scrutinizing look all round the room, go out, and ride away slowly, circling towards the town.|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} that, the small grass, Poa colensoi was a food source for these larvae. This grass is common throughout the Southern Alps, {{but it appears}} that the larvae are present only where the grass grows adjacent to rocky areas. The <b>black</b> mountain <b>ringlet</b> larvae are known night feeders and have been spotted feeding on the tips of tussock blades. The larvae spend little time feeding, but instead choose to conceal themselves in nearby hiding spots. This is to prevent them being preyed upon by aerial predators, which can easily spot them atop tussock grass blades.|$|R
50|$|For {{most of his}} life, Hades clothed {{himself in}} a {{classical}} Greek toga and wore his <b>black</b> hair in <b>ringlets.</b> In recent years however, many of the gods adopted modern clothing {{in an attempt to}} evolve with the times. Hades took to dressing in a dark black suit with top hat and cane, similar to that of a Victorian era Undertaker.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are dull olive-grey, crossed by two basal sinuous incomplete black hues, {{an entire}} antemedial line, two discal and a submarginal denticulated line, {{followed by a}} marginal dentated lunular line. There is an oval <b>black</b> orbicular <b>ringlet</b> mark and an irregular shaped reniform mark, the reniform mark being continued upward to the costa, and the orbicular joined beneath to a larger black ring mark. From the lower ringlet a short blackish streak extends to the discal line. All the markings are edged with white speckles, and the costal end of the markings is dilated and almost confluent. The hindwings have a white basal medial area. The costal border and a broad outer band are black.|$|R
