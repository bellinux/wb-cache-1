5|$|Because it {{was used}} in glassmaking, {{manganese}} dioxide was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. Ignatius Gottfried Kaim (1770) and Johann Glauber (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to permanganate, a useful laboratory reagent. By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. First, hydrochloric acid, or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the Weldon process. The production of chlorine and hypochlorite <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> was a large consumer of manganese ores.|$|E

40|$|Aims and Objectives: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the microhardness of enamel after the application of anticay on bleached enamel with fluoride containing and fluoride free <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent.</b> Materials and Methods: Twenty freshly extracted teeth decoronated and divided mesiodistally into two halves were randomly divided into five groups with 10 samples in each group. The enamel surface was treated as follows: Group 1 - no treatment, Group 2 - fluoride free <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent,</b> Group 3 - fluoride containing <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent,</b> and Group 4 - fluoride free <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> followed by anticay application. The samples were subjected to indentation to test the microhardness using Vicker's hardness analyzer. Conclusion: Enamel microhardness significantly increased in samples where anticay was used after the application of <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent...</b>|$|R

5000|$|TAED is an {{important}} component of laundry detergents that use [...] "active oxygen" [...] <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents.</b> Active oxygen <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> include sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate, sodium perphosphate, sodium persulfate, and urea peroxide. These compounds release hydrogen peroxide during the wash cycle. Hydrogen peroxide is however an inefficient bleach below 60 C. TAED and hydrogen peroxide react to form peroxyacetic acid, a more efficient bleach, allowing lower temperature wash cycles, around 40 C. TAED was first used in a commercial laundry detergent in 1978 (Skip by Unilever). Currently, TAED is the main bleach activator used in European laundry detergents and has an estimated annual consumption of 75 kt.|$|E

50|$|A recent {{addition}} to the field is new light-accelerated <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> containing lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide with a titanium oxide nanoparticle based catalyst. Reduced concentrations of hydrogen peroxide cause lower incidences of tooth hypersensitivity. The nanoparticles act as photocatalysts, and their size prevents them from diffusing deeply into the tooth. When exposed to light, the catalysts produce a rapid, localized breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into highly reactive radicals. Due to the extremely short lifetimes of the free radicals, {{they are able to}} produce bleaching effects similar to much higher concentration <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> within the outer layers of the teeth where the nanoparticle catalysts are located. This provides effective tooth whitening while reducing the required concentration of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive byproducts at the tooth pulp.|$|E

50|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{is produced}} in very large amounts by several different processes. Its action as an oxidizer {{is why it is}} made and used in such large quantities.

5000|$|Oxidizing {{agents are}} added to flour to help with gluten development.
