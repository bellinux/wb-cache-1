40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The {{pursuit of a}} seemingly unfruitful <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>arrangement</b> with South Africa, and continued participation in overlapping, but nonfunctional regional free trade areas, has left Zimbabwe in foreign trade dilemma, specially {{in the light of}} the deteriorating terms of trade with South Africa, her main trading partner and competitor for both mutual and regional trade. This thesis examines the various regional trade possibilities involving Zimbabwe and South Africa using the free trade area and customs union models of international trade. Whereas a functional <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> agreement or a regional customs union culminating in a common market might improve Zimbabwe's regional competitiveness in the short run' due to South Africa's economic dominance and protectionist trade policies, Zimbabwe's potential to benefit from trade with non-participants would be severely curtailed. However, a broad free trade area, which allows flexibility to pursue national trade policies, seems less harmful. The analysis concludes that only a broad free trade area, superseding a' current eastern and southern African regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements,</b> would increase Zimbabwe's economic welfare. It would be in the interests of all regional countries to finalize a single broad free trade area rather than maintain the status quo[URL] Colonel, Zimbabwe National Arm...|$|R

These parallel developments present major challenges to ASEAN, particularly the move towards the AEC by 2015 and the attempts to broaden FTAs in East Asia.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the political economy}} of foreign trade policy-making in the European Union (EU). In light of recent developments in global trade regulation towards more regional and <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements,</b> the paper asks what drives trade-policy-making in the EU? Using a Principal-Agent (PA) framework the paper looks at how institutional and societal factors shape EU trade policy-making and attempts to bring the Community institutions back in. The paper adds to a growing literature on PA that increasingly looks at the agency side of the PA equation. It is argued that the agent (the EU Commission) is neither a master’s servant nor a run-away bureaucrat. The agent is most powerful when setting the agenda and resisting change to its overall strategy. The existence of collective and multiple principals and the multi-level system facilitate agency. Empirically, the paper discusses the use of venues for trade regulation and provides insights from the EU–Mercosur negotiations. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{advances}} {{the view}} that while free trade and trade liberalization under the multilateral framework is the first best policy on purely theoretical grounds, {{the theory of the}} second best in the form of regional, plurilateral and <b>bilateral</b> free <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> is at work in the real world. The methodology of economics is an important discipline; however, dysfunctional and power-structured multilateralism, heterogeneous economic structures and diverse development paths and levels render a political economy approach based on strategic pragmatism more realistic. In addition, empirical results have demonstrated that regional, plurilateral and <b>bilateral</b> free <b>trade</b> agreements can offer benefits to complement and supplement multilateralism provided these arrangements are consistent with the rules of the World Trade Organisation. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} reinforce {{the view that}} while free trade and trade liberalization under the multilateral framework is the first best policy, in the real world, the theory of the second best in regional, plurilateral and <b>bilateral</b> free <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> is at work. A brief overview is germane to capture prevailing trends and developments in trade liberalization, related investment facilitation and other factor flows and economic integration, as the paradigm appears to have moved from multilateral and regional to plurilateral and <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> agreements (see Radtke, and others, eds., 2002). After this stocktaking at various levels and modalities, some interpretations of the economic and geopolitical nuances and impact of trade policy in the broader context of foreign economic policy by various actors in the global economy are attempted in section II. Section III focuses on issues and challenges in the Asia-Pacific region, from which conclusions, policy implications and prospects are drawn in section IV. I.

The results are useful to policymakers because new intra-European trade agreements are being negotiated.

The paper also illustrates that the performance of individual countries under the trade agreements can be explained in terms of their macroeconomic environment.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to answer the question: does a <b>bilateral</b> free <b>trade</b> {{agreement}} (FTA) lead to an improvement in the security of a member country and greater peace between two member countries in the developing world? Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews existing literature and uses the idea of non-economic gains from regional trading agreements to explain how Sri Lanka managed to use FTAs to neutralise India and obtain military assistance from Pakistan using its FTAs with two countries during the recently concluded war. Findings - Even though political objectives were not explicitly outlined in Sri Lanka's two FTAs with its big rival neighbours (India and Pakistan), the FTAs helped Sri Lanka to successfully execute the war against the LTTE (the Tamil Tigers) by neutralising India on the one hand and gaining military assistance from Pakistan on the other. Research limitations/implications - The research approach is basically qualitative. However, there is need to develop a comprehensive theoretical model to capture non-economics gains from FTAs. Originality/value - Although there is a growing body of literature on the underlying political and strategic motivations of countries forming regional and <b>bilateral</b> <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements,</b> this paper adds to understanding of what motivates small developing countries to form trade agreements with big neighbours.

40|$|Recent {{research}} from the World Bank and elsewhere suggests that openness to trade was a vital ingredient in the transition of the former Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) that joined the EU in May 2004. Current EU association agreements in South East Europe indicate that future enlargements may need to accommodate the remaining former Yugoslav Republics {{as well as the}} existing candidate countries. This paper examines persistent concerns that trade openness in South East Europe generally, and the former Yugoslav Republics in particular, is much less advanced than it was for the former CEECs in the mid to late 1990 s. In particular we examine the issue of whether the present network of <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> put in place under the Stability Pact has had much effect in boosting trade integration and whether trade within the region is currently at or below its potential. Given the small size of many of the countries in the region, we find that trade patterns remain problematic. In some cases they are smaller than might be expected but in several cases there is an overdependence on trade with old Yugoslav neighbours. In view of this, we consider that current plans to extend the Stability Pact matrix of <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> agreements into a pan-regional trade association are likely to be inadequate. A better option, and one {{more likely to have a}} more immediate effect, would be to extend the present Customs Union with Turkey to include trade with the entire South East European zone of countries linked to the EU...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that trade and environmental policy are complementary in achieving sustainable development. Chapter 2 of Agenda 21 emphasises {{the need to}} promote sustainable economic ‘development through trade’. It states that this must be done through ‘a commitment to sound economic policies and management, an effective and predictable public administration, the integration of environmental concerns into decision-making and progress towards democratic government’ (UNESD, 1992, ch. 2, para 2. 6). The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation 2002 of the World Summit on Sustainable Development has subsequently reinforced this call. The Preamble to the WTO Agreement commits to multilateral trade liberalisation {{in the pursuit of}} sustainable development and purports to protect and preserve the environment. Despite the recognition of this linkage, the current multilateral trading system is littered with the arbitrary and discriminatory use of environmental requirements for trade restrictive purposes as well as environmentally unsustainable free trade. Furthermore, the trade-environment nexus needs to be upheld in all free <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> – whether those arrangements are bilateral, regional, or multilateral. While, this nexus has been enshrined in some multilateral treaties, currently, incorporation of the trade-environment nexus has not been considered at the bilateral level. This paper will examine the prospects and challenges of bilateral economic integration and sustainable development pursuant to GATT Article 24. The paper will argue that integration of sustainable development into <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> will create new avenues for regional and global trade liberalization and maximise trade-induced sustainable development. The focus of this Paper is on how sustainable development principles can be enshrined in <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> agreements between Australia and India with special reference to the primary sector, specifically agricultural products and natural resources. Both Australia and India are committed to economic development as well as environmental protection yet both countries treat the environment as a non-trade issue. Against this context, the paper will examine (i) the extent to which Australian <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> treaties with India can integrate sustainable development;(ii) explore economic and other implications of focusing on sustainable development in trade treaties; and (iii) illustrate how <b>bilateral</b> preferential <b>trade</b> agreements can serve as stepping-stones for global trade liberalization...|$|R
40|$|With {{the spread}} of {{regional}} and <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements,</b> there is always concern about the discriminatory impact on non-members. For example, the establishment of NAFTA deprived the Caribbean Basin of its preferential status vis-a-vis Mexico in the US market. Or alternatively, the enlargement of the EU from 15 to 25 countries may have adverse discriminatory effects on outsiders. This paper develops a method for assessing the effect of regional integration on non-member (non-integrating) countries that sustain trade diversion and/or lose preferential status in the integrating area. It then applies this methodology to gauge {{the impact of the}} 2004 EU Enlargement from 15 to 25 countries on the Mediterranean Basin. The method consists of three sequential steps: (1) determine the commodity overlap in the exports to the EU- 15 between the acceding 10 and the Mediterranean countries. This is done by use of correlation coefficients and a specially-devised 'export-similarity index'; (2) to the extent that significant overlap is found, identify the product groups in which it exists; and (3) determine the degree of protection in the EU- 15 in those products and, hence, the erosion of competitive position of outsiders.

Our empirical findings-based on different measures of conflict constructed using alternate definitions of contiguity and conflict-reveal a significant collateral damage in terms of foregone trade {{as a result of}} spillovers from conflict in neighboring countries. The magnitude of this negative externality is somewhat larger for international conflicts than intrastate warfare, but about one-third of conflict in the host economies. Further, the impact is persistent-on average, it takes <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> three years to recover from the end of intrastate conflicts in neighboring states, and five years from international conflicts. These findings are robust to alternate definitions of conflict, estimation methods, and specifications, and underscore the importance of taking into account spillover effects when estimating the economic costs of warfare.

40|$|Regional {{integration}} {{initiatives have}} surged in Latin America while many countries have undertaken unilateral trade liberalization, and external market access prospects have improved with the successful {{conclusion of the}} Uruguay Round. The author examines the choices faced by one such country: Bolivia. To the extent that different regional trade agreements follow World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, they could increase market access and allow the countries to realize gains that unilateral liberalization might not have given them. In this sense, regional <b>trade</b> <b>arrangement</b> is not inconsistent with multilateral free trade based on the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle. Estimating export demands using ordinary least squares for different markets {{as well as an}} error correction model, constructing a trade compatibility index, and recognizing the presence of contraband trade, the author examines Bolivia's four main options for regional integration and ranks them as follows: 1) MFN-based trade combined with a regional agreement that gives it preferential access to Mercosur (GATT-plus trade); 2) Joining Mercosur and maintaining duty-free access to the Andean Group; 3) Remaining within the Andean Group and receiving additional market-access concessions from Mercosur; and 4) Remaining within the Andean Group and maintaining existing <b>bilateral</b> <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements.</b> These rankings reflect relative trade access to different markets, assuming stability of demand functions and trade and production patterns. In the final analysis, regional integration is not merely a matter of economics, but is related to domestic and regional politics - and those who gain from different choices will support those choices. MFN trade would elicit neither strong opposition nor strong support, as its benefits and costs are more symmetrically distributed than trade associated with increased regional integration.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a timely review and {{analysis}} of China's regional trade agreements, its motivations, and its economic implications for Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) member countries and other trading partners. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses the SMART model of the World Integrated Trade Solution to quantify the economic implications of the ACFTA on merchandise trade flows among member countries and other trading partners. Then, for comparative purposes, the impact of two possible paths beyond the ACFTA is simulated: an East Asia Free Trade Agreement (EAFTA) and the possible Doha Round multilateral trade liberalization. Findings – The paper finds that, if regional and <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>arrangement</b> (RTA) were only concentrated in tariff reductions, the impact on trade flows would be quite limited. China's trade liberalization will bring the similar impacts to ASEAN in three of the scenarios modeled. Japan and Korea would get more market access to China if an EAFTA were to become reality. Only in a multilateral liberalization would all RTA member countries and the rest of the world benefit. Research limitations/implications – Three limitations are noteworthy. First, these types of models capture only static gains from trade. Second, the simulations do not include services liberalization, which could readily provide benefits in several multiples of merchandise trade, and third, it is assumed that full removal of all border barriers at once, in a multilateral scenario, would be of illuminating heuristic value but is unlikely to occur in reality. Originality/value – The paper demonstrates the wisdom of China's simultaneous pursuit of unilateral, regional and multilateral liberalization – because the wider the trading group involved in the liberalization, the more China and its partners will benefit. The tariff reductions in RTAs will have limited effects on expanding merchandise trade, especially when compared with comprehensive and multilateral liberalization agreements.

This paper provides estimates of trade and welfare effects of East Asian currency unions, using a micro-founded gravity model. Counter-factual experiments to assess the effects of various hypothetical currency arrangements for East Asia suggest that an East Asian currency union will double <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> in the region, but the resulting welfare effects will be moderate. However, if Japan, a major trade partner for East Asia, is included in the union, welfare effects increase substantially. The evidence thus suggests that certain regional currency arrangements in East Asia will stimulate regional trade rigorously and can generate economically significant welfare gains.

The goal {{of this paper is to}} shed some light on this question. The results show that membership in the Asian RTAs considered in this study have not, to date, occurred at the expense of trade with nonmembers, as most Asian countries'' integration with the global economy preceded regional integration. However, looking forward, given their discriminatory nature, a proliferation of RTAs, which is not accompanied by continuing unilateral and multilateral liberalization, could run the risk of leading to costly trade diversion.

40|$|Agriculture {{is a major}} {{economic}} activity in Bangladesh. It currently employs around 50 percent of country’s labor force and contributes around 20 percent of country’s GDP. Growth in agricultural sector has important linkages with the overall economy through various channels. It {{is important to note}} that, at the WTO, Bangladesh, as an LDC, is not bound to undertake any liberalisation in its domestic agricultural sector in terms of tariff cut or subsidy withdrawal. However, there are concerns that actions taken by the developed and developing countries in terms of reduction in agricultural domestic support measures might have important negative implications for the net food importing countries like Bangladesh. It is also important to note that under <b>bilateral</b> <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements,</b> such as India-Bangladesh bilateral FTA, there are scopes for increased trade in agricultural products between Bangladesh and India. Bangladesh’s market access for its agricultural exports in India is likely to increase whereas there will be increased imports of agricultural products from India. Therefore, liberalisation in the trade in agriculture has important implications for the agricultural commodities which are either exported or imported. Increased market access of agricultural exports from Bangladesh under such trade agreement will lead to rise in production and employment in those export-oriented sectors; whereas, domestic liberalisation in the agricultural sectors may dampen output and employment in the import-competing agricultural sectors. It thus appears that the growth in the domestic agricultural sector doesn’t only rely on the domestic policies and programs, rather global and regional trade policies have important implications for this sector. Moreover, the various economic policies and programs, such as domestic fiscal policies, import policies and programs for growth in agricultural productivity also affect the development of the agricultural sector in an economy. This study explores the links between {{major economic}} policy reforms and growth the agricultural sector in Bangladesh. This study examines how economic policy reforms affect the agricultural sector in Bangladesh in terms of output, import, export and employment. Under a general equilibrium framework, this study explores three trade liberalization scenarios (a global agricultural trade liberalization scenario under WTO-Doha agreement, Bangladesh – India bilateral FTA, and domestic agricultural trade liberalization), one fiscal policy scenario (rise in agricultural subsidy) and one technological change scenario (rise in agricultural productivity). ...|$|R

Estimates from a gravity model and <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> data support the view that both CEFTA and BFTA helped expand regional trade and limit the emergence of a "hub-and-spoke" relationship between the CEECs and the European Union (EU). These empirical conclusions carry some important policy implications for the "second wave" of prospective EU members among Southeastern European Countries (SEECs). The paper argues that the SEECs should reconsider their <b>bilateral</b> approach to <b>trade</b> liberalization and move towards a multilateral free-trade area as exemplified by both the CEFTA and BFTA.

Although gravity models have been extensively used to measure <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> among countries, they have—to the best of our knowledge—never been used to measure intra-Arab trade. Our results suggest that intra-Arab trade and Arab trade with the rest of the world are lower than what would be predicted by the gravity equation, suggesting considerable scope for regional—as well as multilateral—integration. The results also suggest that intra-GCC and intra-Maghreb trade are relatively low while the Mashreq countries exhibit a higher level of intragroup trade.

40|$|This paper aims {{to explain}} the {{historical}} development of Australia's foreign economic policy by using an analytical framework called a 'state-society coalition' approach. This approach focuses on virtual coalitions of state and society actors that share 'belief systems' and hold similar policy ideas, goals and preferences, as basic units (policy subsystems) of policy making. Major policy changes occur when a dominant coalition is replaced by another. The paper argues that, in Australia, there have been three major state-society coalitions in the foreign economic policy issue area: 'protectionists', 'trade liberalisers' and 'optional bilateralists'. The rise and fall of these coalitions resulted in distinctive shifts of Australia's foreign economic policy in the 1980 s towards unilateral and multilateral liberalisation and in the late 1990 s towards <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> and investment <b>arrangements.</b> Australia, Foreign economic policy, State-society coalitions, Belief systems, Changes in dominant coalitions, Economic policy, Trade policy, International trade, International economic relations...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a surge in <b>bilateral</b> and {{regional}} <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements</b> between developed and developing countries, which are known as North-South RTAs. Under the current legal system of the WTO, North-South RTAs are governed by Article XXIV of the GATT or Article V of the GATS, which means such RTAs must be reciprocal and must cover substantially all the trade. On the other hand, there is another category of rules on RTAs based on the so-called Enabling Clause, which, in exceptional circumstances, provides special and differential treatment (SDT) for RTAs among developing countries. This paper considers the applicability of the SDT concept to North-South RTAs by examining why rules on RTAs and the concept of SDT were incorporated into the GATT/WTO legal framework so as to permit the derogation of most-favored-nation (MFN) obligations.
