40|$|ABSTRACT. Web {{services}} technology {{is emerging as}} the main pillar of service-oriented architectures (SOAs). This technology facilitates application integration by enabling programmatic access to applications through standard, XML-based languages and protocols. While much {{progress has been made}} toward providing <b>basic</b> <b>interoperability</b> among applications, there are still many needs and unexploited opportunities in this area. In particular, services in SOAs require richer description models than object or component interfaces since services are developed independently of clients. Hence, service descriptions need to include all the information needed by clients to understand if they can interact with a service and how. This paper discusses our new results on modeling and analyzing web services business protocols augmented with timing constraints. We discuss these notions informally through examples, and expose the benefits of connecting our new model with the theory of timed automata...|$|R

40|$|Phasor {{measurement}} unit (PMU) devices, and the standards to govern PMUs, have progressed {{since the first}} standard appeared in 1995. The early standards contained significant ambiguities {{in the definition of}} the phasor time - tagging, and no independent verification facilities existed to test compliance with the standards. The latest standards, as a result of significant {{effort on the part of}} the IEEE working group, contain extremely detailed test descriptions and requirements. The standards are also supported by a number of facilities/companies which are capable of independently verifying compliance, using traceable amplitude and time/phase measurement chains. This provides a high level of confidence in a <b>basic</b> <b>interoperability</b> of PMU devices during "normal" operation. However, as the power network evolves in the future, with dynamic events becoming more commonplace, and imperfect power quality becoming perhaps the "norm", care still needs to be exercised since the actual PMU outputs during dynamic and imperfect network conditions are still specific to the actual device hardware, algorithm/filter, and configuration/settings...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSystems-of-Systems (SoS) {{are formed}} by {{independent}} systems termed as constituents. SoS exhibit dynamic properties called emergent behaviors, {{which are a}} global functionality that appears {{as a result of}} the <b>interoperability</b> among <b>constituents.</b> However,software architecture descriptions of SoS are often static. In turn, dynamic models such as simulation models (also adopted to specify SoS) do not use to preserve software architecture details, which can hamper the software quality. In this paper, we propose a modeltransformation approach to harmonize software architecture descriptions of SoS and simulation models to support validation ofemergent behaviors. We model a software architecture of SoS by the adoption of SosADL, a novel architectural description language(ADL) for SoS, and transform it to DEVS, a formalism for simulation of SoS. Our approach offers a dynamic view to architectural descriptions of SoS, preserving the architectural integrity of the SoS, and supporting the visualization and validation of emergent behaviors. We evaluate our proposal through a case study conducted within the context of a real SoS in operation for flood monitoring in an urban area. Preliminary results show that the transformation is feasible, generating functional simulation models that support the validation of emergent behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Grid {{software}} projects require infrastructures {{in order}} to evaluate interoperability with other projects and compliance with predefined standards. Interoperability and compliance are quality attributes that are expected from all distributed projects. ETICS is designed to automate the investigation {{of this kind of}} problems. It integrates well-established procedures, tools and resources in a coherent framework and adaptes them to the special needs of these projects. Interoperability and compliance to standards are important quality attributes of software developed for Grid environments where many different parts of an interconnected system have to interact. Compliance to standard {{is one of the major}} factors in making sure that interoperating parts of a distributed system can actually interconnect and exchange information. Taking the case of the Grid environment (Foster and Kesselman, 2003), most of the projects that are developing software have not reached the maturity level of other communities yet and have difficulty to identify and adopt standards. Validating the compliance with standards often requires the design of custom test suites and a constant attention to any proposed change. Interoperability amongst middleware and application software developed {{in order to}} be used on Grid and other distributed environments is usually a very complex issue. ETICS provides a single reference for software configuration information, which separate projects can use to validate <b>basic</b> <b>interoperability</b> assumption when developing the code. The co-scheduling mechanism has been developed in ETICS in order to automatically deploy and run distributed tests in different platforms. By coscheduling it is understood the automation of the deployment of the different services and clients, the execution of the tests and the gathering of information such as test results, metrics, and logs. A typical scenario to be faced by the coscheduling is composed of several services that interoperate among them, clients that contact the various services and tests that require servers and clients to be in place. This functionality has been applied for testing the interoperability between job submission engines (like CREAM) by using their conformance to the OGSA-BES recommendation. ETICS has therefore been adopted to perform this test automatically. We presented the co-scheduling mechanism used to execute complex distributed tests requiring the deployment of many interacting services on different physical nodes. A practical application to the interoperability testing of the CREAM-BES service has been presented. Additional work on this technology is being performed to expand its use to other types of tests, middleware, services and applications...|$|R
