25|$|But in 1951 I {{found myself}} in serious difficulty. I had been {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> had brought me a gift.|$|E

She is reluctant, but Douglas orders her to obey his command: (Aria: Taci, lo voglio, e basti / [...] "Be quiet! [...] It is my wish...Show me that you're a daughter worthy of her father"). As he leaves, trumpets announce Rodrigo; Douglas [...] orders Elena to follow him.|$|E

60|$|My {{position}} was embarrassing, for I felt {{that for the}} instant they had forgotten my presence. But Lord Linchmere came <b>back</b> suddenly <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> my engagement.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again, <b>and</b> spoke. Her {{voice was}} still the same soft, low voice as ever. It was fearful to hear how little it had altered, and then to look on the changed face.|$|R
