5|$|After Spare's death, Grant {{began to}} focus more on his own writing career. From 1959 to 1963, Grant privately {{published}} the Carfax Monographs, a series of short articles on magic published in ten installments, each at a limited print run of 100. Nine of these volumes included original artworks produced by Steffi, reflecting the increasing collaboration <b>between</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> which would be reflected in many of Grant's subsequent publications. The Carfax Monographs would eventually be assembled together and re-released as Hidden Lore in 1989. In 1966 he also privately published a small book of his poems, Black to Black and Other Poems. During the 1950s and 1960s Spare also authored a number of novels, although these would only be published by Starfire Publishing between 1997 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|Khitan {{marriage}} practices {{differed from}} those of the Han Chinese in several ways. Men from the elite classes tended to marry women from the generation their senior. While this did not necessarily mean {{that there would be a}} large gap in ages <b>between</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife,</b> it was often the case. Among the ruling Yelü clan, the average age that boys married was sixteen, while the average age that girls married was between sixteen and twenty-two. Although rare, ages as young as twelve were recorded, for both boys and girls. A special variety of polygamy known as sororate, in which a man would marry two or more women who were sisters, was practiced among the Liao elite. Polygamy was not restricted only to sororate, with some men having three or more wives, only some of whom were sisters. Sororate continued throughout the length of the Liao dynasty, despite laws banning the practice. Over the course of the dynasty, the Liao elite moved away from polygamy and towards the Han Chinese system of having one wife and one or more concubines. This was done largely to smooth over the process of inheritance.|$|E

5|$|Sashadhar Mukherjee, an {{assistant}} sound-engineer at the studio, had a brotherly bond with Devika Rani because {{both of them}} were Bengalis and spoke that language with each other. He established contact with the runaway couple and managed to convince Devika Rani to return to her husband. In the India of that era, divorce was legally almost impossible and women who eloped were regarded as no better than prostitutes and were shunned by their own families. In her heart of hearts, Devika Rani knew that she could not secure a divorce or marry Hassan under any circumstances. She negotiated with her husband through the auspices of Sashadhar Mukherjee, seeking the separation of her finances from those of her husband as a condition for her return. Henceforth, she would be paid separately for working in his films, but he would be required to single-handedly pay the household expenses for the home in which both of them would live. Himanshu agreed to this, in order to save face in society and to prevent his studio from going bankrupt. Devika Rani returned to her marital home. However, things {{would never be the same}} <b>between</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> again, and it is said that thenceforth, their relationship was largely confined to work and little or no intimacy transpired between them after this episode.|$|E
5|$|Stone and Blackwell {{developed}} a private agreement aimed at preserving and protecting Stone’s financial independence and personal liberty. In monetary matters, {{they agreed that}} the marriage be like a business partnership, with the partners being “joint proprietors of everything except the results of previous labors.” Neither would have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other’s costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other’s subsequent earnings. Each would {{have the right to}} will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Over Blackwell’s objections, Stone refused to be supported and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses. In addition to financial independence, Stone and Blackwell agreed that each would enjoy personal independence and autonomy: “Neither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is agreeable to both.” During their discussion of marriage, Stone had given Blackwell a copy of Henry C. Wright’s book Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness, and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship <b>between</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> should be. Wright proposed that because women bore the results of sexual intercourse, wives should govern a couple’s marital relations. In accordance with that view, Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose “when, where and how often” she would “become a mother.” In addition to this private agreement, Blackwell drew up a protest of laws, rules, and customs that conferred superior rights on husbands and, as part of the wedding ceremony, pledged never to avail himself of those laws.|$|E

40|$|In Brazil, wives {{do most of}} the {{household}} work. About sixty percent of them also work outside {{the household}}, working a total of about 10 hours more per week than men. Because of this unequal distribution of household work, <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> might have different priorities regarding the purchase of durable goods. Although both <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> enjoy entertainment durable goods, wives might have a relative preference for household-production durable goods such as washing machines over entertainment durable goods such as televisions. Using a Brazilian household consumption survey, we examine whether decisions about ownership of entertainment and production durable goods are the outcomes of a bargaining process <b>between</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives.</b> We use several variables to measure bargaining power, including the ratio of women to men in a state. The results indicate that decisions about durable goods ownership are the outcomes of bargaining processes <b>between</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> with wives having a relative preference for household-production durable goods over entertainment durable goods compared to their husbands. Bargaining might explain why ownership of household production durable goods is relatively low in Brazil, despite their potential to save women's time...|$|R

40|$|Research {{question}} : Is there agreement <b>between</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> regarding unmet need {{of family}} planning? Hypothesis : The unmet need {{of family planning}} is perceived more by women then their husbands. Objective : 1) To ascertain the unmet needs of family planning for <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives.</b> 2) To ascertain the level of agreement <b>between</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> regarding unmet needs of family planning. Design: A cross-sectional survey Setting: Dayalpur village in Intensive field practice area of Comprehensive Rural Health Services project (CRHSP), Ballabgarh, Haryana. Study Period: July 2003 - June 2005. Participants included 200 married couples selected by simple random sampling. Statistical Analysis: Level of agreement <b>between</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> was analyzed using Kappa statistics. Results: Unmet need for family planning was 11 &#x 0025; (22 out of 200) for <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> 17. 5 &#x 0025; (35 out of 200) for wives. The difference was seen both in unmet need for spacing (M- 3. 5 &#x 0025; vs. F- 6 &#x 0025;) as well as limiting family size (M- 7. 5 &#x 0025; vs. F- 11. 5 &#x 0025;). Overall, 93. 5 &#x 0025; concordance was observed amongst <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives.</b> In all the cases where disagreement was seen (6. 5 &#x 0025;), wives reported having unmet need for contraception whereas their husbands perceived none. The unadjusted Kappa statistic was 0. 73 and prevalence adjusted Kappa was 0. 88. Conclusion: Unmet need for family planning was significantly higher for wives compared to husbands. Despite high degrees of agreement amongst the couples, the nature of disconcordance reinforces the need for policy makers {{to take into account}} the perspective of men...|$|R

25|$|Tristanne J. Connolly makes {{a similar}} observation, {{stating that the}} husband-wife motif {{reflects}} marriage as it was understood at the time. Connolly also suggests that in context the marriage metaphor was necessary in that it truly exemplified the unequal interaction between Yahweh and the people Israel. Biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan describes the importance of understanding the covenant in relation to interpreting Hosea. According to Coogan, Hosea falls under a unique genre called “covenant lawsuit” where God accuses Israel of breaking their previously made agreement. God’s disappointment towards Israel is therefore expressed through the broken marriage covenant made <b>between</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife.</b>|$|E

A partner is also given to a person who loved the ideal of marriage but never found a true partner in this world.

25|$|The estrangement <b>between</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> was a {{convenient}} political tool that Fulk used in 1134 when he accused Hugh II of Le Puiset, Count of Jaffa, {{of having an}} affair with Melisende. Hugh was the most powerful baron in the kingdom, and devotedly loyal to the memory of Baldwin II. This loyalty now extended to Melisende, though Hugh, by strict male succession, held a better claim to the throne. Hugh was a cousin of Melisende, and {{also a member of the}} royal family. Contemporary sources, such as William of Tyre, discount the alleged infidelity of Melisende and instead point out that Fulk overly favoured newly arrived Frankish crusaders from Anjou over the native nobility of the kingdom. Had Melisende been guilty, the Church and nobility likely would not have later rallied to her cause.|$|E

25|$|Following his ordination, Gibbs became {{active in}} the {{abolitionist}} movement. He attended a series of black conventions where he worked with Frederick Douglass and served on committees. He gradually became known nationally {{for his work in}} the movement. Gibbs was featured in anti-slavery publications including The Liberator and The National Anti-Slavery Standard. His rising fame was indicative of Gibbs' own ambitions as well his skills as an orator and rising abolitionist minister. His growing involvement in New York's abolitionist movement separated him from his family. In part due to his extensive absences from home and his parish duties, Gibbs became increasingly alienated from his wife. Anna was accustomed to living standards that a young pastor could not afford. The tension <b>between</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> prompted Gibbs to consider leaving the United States for Africa to work as a missionary. However, he was persuaded by his congregation to abandon these plans. The marital discord eventually led to lengthy and bitter divorce proceedings, which lasted until 1862. Not long afterward, Gibbs returned to his native Philadelphia where he continued work in the abolitionist movement.|$|E

[...] During the hour-long broadcast Chrissie leads Sam and Zoe into facing Den, with 14.34 million people watching her deliver the fatal blow to her husband after a violent struggle. Oberman [...] "begged the producers to let Chrissie do it to prove she wasn't a sap", adding [...] "It was a real rush for me." [...] In the aftermath of Den's death, Chrissie became an increasingly [...] "transformed" [...] and colder figure, as the character [...] "played" [...] and [...] "spun" [...] her way [...] "out of every situation". She proceeds to trick Zoe into taking the blame for Den's murder, and continuously outmanoeuvres Sam in the latter's efforts to get back the Vic. Oberman felt {{this to be a}} noticeable shift in Chrissie's characterisation, with the show's writers taking [...] "her down a darker route", as in one notable scene depicting Chrissie standing over Den's grave, and confiding to him of her plans.|$|E
500|$|The term 'heavy metal', as it {{was used}} by Lester Bangs and Dave Marsh at Creem, {{referred}} to a sound best exemplified by albums such as Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin II, Deep Purple's Deep Purple in Rock, and Black Sabbath's Paranoid.

Led Zeppelin's [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] could just as well be a conversation <b>between</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife,</b> as not. Black Sabbath's [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] exactly parallels the blood red moon of the Book of Revelation by John of Patmos, while their [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] describes the ravages of drug abuse. Ozzy Osbourne could be heard preaching to his audience in the earlier song, [...] "Children of the Grave": [...] "Tell the world that love is still alive you must be brave; or the children of today are children of the grave." [...] Later, in the song [...] "In My Time of Dying", Robert Plant even pleaded to Jesus: [...] "Meet me Jesus, meet me; Meet me {{in the middle of the}} air; if my wings should fail me Lord, please meet me with another pair." [...] Perhaps not overtly Christian, but songs such as these exhibited similar themes. Early heavy metal fans were viewed by the populace as a counterculture, just as the fans of rock and roll, in general, were. Early heavy metal lyrics and themes were often accused of challenging Christian values, and as the genre grew, some bands actually did.|$|E

Four major questions were investigated. First, is there a relationship between length of marriage and couple congruency? Second, do husbands or wives show any differences in congruency? Third, are there some aspects of a person's self-concept (e. g., identity, acceptance, behavior, physical, moral-ethical, personal, family and social) which are more congruent than others?
