5|$|The usual form of {{locomotion}} is hopping, with <b>both</b> <b>feet</b> {{leaving the}} ground and landing simultaneously. However, birds may run when performing the rodent-run display. Its balance is assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.|$|E
5|$|Milne was {{naturally}} right-footed, though trained {{hard with}} his left foot as a boy to become equally skilled with <b>both</b> <b>feet.</b> Former Dundee United teammate Paul Hegarty stated that Milne possessed great pace, as well as bravery, a good work ethic, {{and an ability to}} score important goals. Another former Dundee United teammate, Davie Dodds, said that Milne was as good a finisher as any player in Scottish football during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{aim is to}} land on, or ideally surpass, a line marked {{across the}} hill called the 'K-point', 'critical point', or 'calculation line'. In order to attain the most points from the style judges, athletes strive for a 'Telemark' landing: instead of landing with simply <b>both</b> <b>feet</b> together (a 'two-footed' landing), one foot is planted clearly {{in front of the}} other (without sliding the skis), <b>both</b> <b>feet</b> held no more than four ski widths' apart, and the body held stable with a straight back and arms outstretched. This pose must be maintained until the 'outrun' – a line at the very end of the hill, where the slope has fully flattened out – is reached. The exact placement of landing is measured between the athlete's front and back feet. Failing to make a Telemark landing results in a loss of style points. Considerably more points are lost if a landing fails before the outrun line, such as falling over or touching the ground with any part of the body except the feet. However, when the hill begins to flatten out, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a Telemark landing.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was known}} for his {{composure}} and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward, Bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker, where he essentially functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward, due to his ball skills and creative ability, which enabled him to drop deep between the lines and link-up play. A quick, elegant, intelligent, and technically gifted player, his excellent first touch, quick feet, dribbling ability, and change of pace enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations, while his attacking movement, physique, balance, and close control allowed him to hold up the ball and create space for teammates; his vision and passing range with <b>both</b> <b>feet,</b> despite being naturally right-footed, subsequently allowed him to provide assists for on-running strikers. Bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role, as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals, rather than scoring them himself.|$|E
5|$|Giovinco is a small, quick, {{technically}} gifted, and agile player, with noted dribbling skills, balance, acceleration, {{and excellent}} ball control; these characteristics {{allow him to}} beat opponents, hold up the ball {{with his back to}} goal or in tight spaces, and create space or chances for teammates, despite his lack of strong physical attributes. Although he is capable of scoring goals, he also possesses good link-up play as well as notable playmaking skills, and he is known for his vision, creativity, and his passing and striking ability with <b>both</b> <b>feet,</b> despite being naturally right footed, as well as his accuracy and ball delivery from free kicks. Giovinco is capable of playing in several offensive positions, and he is usually deployed in a free role as a second striker, although he is also capable of playing as a winger, on either flank, or in the centre as a creative attacking midfielder; he has also been used in a more offensive, central role as a main striker.|$|E
5|$|Jesé {{is able to}} play {{across the}} front line, {{operating}} either as an attacking midfielder, second striker or centre-forward, or in his favoured position out on the wing. During his time at the Castilla, Jesé was often deployed in a false 9 role in the team's 4–3–3 formation, and regularly switched flanks due to his ability to use <b>both</b> <b>feet.</b> In 2013, {{in his role as}} the club's sporting director at the time, Zinedine Zidane declared himself an admirer of Jesé's direct style of football and goal scoring ability. Following Jesé's promotion to Real Madrid's first team in 2013, manager Carlo Ancelotti played him in a winger position, where he could cut inside from the wing both with the ball and without, to create chances and score goals.|$|E

5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in <b>both</b> <b>feet</b> but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 2010, the 19-year-old Kieftenbeld {{signed a}} {{four-year}} contract with Eredivisie club Groningen, who paid a €300,000 {{fee for the}} player. He was presented as a right back, despite only ever having played in midfield. In his first season at Groningen he did indeed play at right back, competently enough, but in a 5–1 defeat away to Feyenoord, he struggled against Ryo Miyaichi, a player with pace and ability with <b>both</b> <b>feet,</b> and eventually fouled him to concede a penalty. Groningen finished the season in fifth position, thus qualifying for the play-offs for {{a place in the}} Europa League. Kieftenbeld was sent off in the first leg of the semi-final, so was suspended for the second. He was replaced at half-time in the first leg of the final, which Groningen lost 5–1 to ADO Den Haag, and was an unused substitute in the second leg as they recovered from the four-goal deficit only to lose out on penalties.|$|E
5|$|One major {{distinguishing}} feature between all loris species is locomotion: the Sunda slow loris moves slowly through trees {{on all four}} limbs, typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time. Its movement {{has been described as}} unique; similar to crawling, or as if it was climbing in every direction, the Sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed. In captivity, about a quarter of its time is spent moving quadrupedally, a quarter suspended or hanging, a quarter climbing, and a quarter clasping multiple branches (bridging). It may hang below a branch by one or <b>both</b> <b>feet</b> for long periods of time.|$|E

5|$|Speaker {{guided the}} 1920 Indians {{to their first}} World Series win. In a crucial late season game against the second-place White Sox, Speaker caught a hard line drive hit to deep right-center field by Shoeless Joe Jackson, ending the game. On a dead run, Speaker leaped with <b>both</b> <b>feet</b> off the ground, snaring the ball before {{crashing}} into a concrete wall. As he lay unconscious from the impact, Speaker still held the baseball. In the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, Speaker hit an RBI triple in the deciding game, which the Indians won 3–0. Cleveland's 1920 season was also significant due {{to the death of}} Ray Chapman on August 17. Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch from Carl Mays. Chapman had been asked about retirement before the season, {{and he said that he}} wanted to help Speaker earn Cleveland's first World Series victory before thinking of retirement.|$|E

At the dance studio where she claimed to have trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet. The bar where she claimed to work has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Aoyama that the police found three extra fingers, an extra ear, and an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Aoyama has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Aoyama's house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Aoyama comes home, pours a drink, and begins feeling {{the effects of the}} drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami's apartment contains a man missing <b>both</b> <b>feet,</b> his tongue, one ear and three fingers on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food. Asami vomits into a dog dish and places it on the floor for the man. The man sticks his face into the vomit and hungrily consumes it.|$|E

5|$|In {{his early}} years at Marseille, Nasri was {{deployed}} in several positions, most notably as a deep-lying midfielder and a wide midfielder primarily {{on the right side}} as he was deemed too small to play {{in the middle of the}} park. After two years of developing his physical traits, in the 2006–07 season, manager Albert Emon inserted Nasri into the playmaker role, where his vision, technical skill and ability to read and understand the game suited him. Since that season, Nasri has been primarily deployed in the position or as a central attacking midfielder at both club and international level. The player has personally admitted that playing centrally is his preference. However, as a result of his versatility, Nasri can also function on the wing and spent the majority of his career at Arsenal occupying the role in the team's 4–3–3 formation. His close control with the ball, speed, dribbling, crossing, and ability to use <b>both</b> <b>feet</b> suits the position well, which has resulted in former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club. Nasri often featured centrally for Arsenal in the absence of former club captain Cesc Fàbregas.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes criminals {{were beaten}} with the bastinado to gain confessions, but Han {{scholars}} argued that torture {{was not the}} best means of gaining confession, while court conferences were called into session to decide how many strokes should be given and what size the stick should be {{so as not to}} cause permanent injury. Imprisonment was an unheard of form of punishment during Han; common punishments were the death penalty by beheading, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, exile, or monetary fines. Mutilating punishments also existed in early Han, borrowed from previous practice in Qin. This included tattooing the face, cutting off the nose, castration, and amputation of one or <b>both</b> <b>feet,</b> yet by 167 BCE these were abolished in favor of lengthy floggings with the bastinado. Further reforms were implemented by the first year of Emperor Jing's (r. 154141 BCE) reign which decreased the amount of strokes a prisoner could receive from the bastinado. Starting in 195 BCE, those aged seventy and older were exempt from mutilating punishments. Further reforms exempted those aged seventy and older from harsh interrogation methods in cases other than false accusation and murder.|$|E
5|$|Stirrup: There are {{authors who}} {{point out that}} it is unclear whether the stirrup was invented by {{northern}} nomads or the sedentary Chinese. Liu Han (1961) credited the invention of the stirrup to nomadic invaders of northern China. Archaeologial evidence shows that horse riders in India had a small loop for a single toe to be inserted by roughly the 1st century AD. However, the first true depiction of the stirrup is featured on a Jin Dynasty (265–420) Chinese tomb figurine dated 302 AD, yet this was a single stirrup and was perhaps used only for initially mounting the horse. The first validated depiction of a rider with a pair of saddle stirrups for <b>both</b> <b>feet</b> comes from a Jin Chinese tomb figurine dated 322. The first actual specimens of stirrups comes from a Chinese tomb in southern Manchuria that is dated 415. The stirrup was not widely used by Chinese cavalry until the 5th century. By the 6th century, the use of the stirrup had spread as far west as the Byzantine Empire, where both the stirrup and Celtic horseshoe were adopted.|$|E

5|$|After visiting Madeira and Jamaica, {{the ship}} arrived in Veracruz, Mexico, on 9 February to relieve her sister ship, , and protect British {{interests}} during the ongoing Mexican Revolution. Two weeks later, she visited Galveston, Texas, before heading for Tampico, Mexico where she arrived on 11 March. Essex only {{spent a few}} days there before returning to Veracruz on 13 March. She was in Tampico when Mexican soldiers briefly detained American sailors buying gasoline for their ship on 9 April (the Tampico Affair) and returned to Veracruz ten days later, {{two days before the}} Americans began landing there on 21 April. They were not satisfied by the Mexican apologies and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson ordered the city occupied in retribution and to forestall a major arms delivery to Victoriano Huerta's forces. The Mexicans resisted and stray bullets hit Essex the next day, wounding one man who was shot in <b>both</b> <b>feet.</b> Tweedie, escorted by two ratings, was sent to take dispatches for the British Minister in Mexico City on the 26th and returned two days later. Rear-Admiral Christopher Craddock inspected the ship and her crew on 5–6 May. Essex sailed for Tampico on 10 May before leaving Mexican waters on the 14th. A month later, the ship was in Quebec City when she was visited by the Canadian Minister of Marine and Fisheries on 16 June. The following month, Essex ferried the Governor General of Canada, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, to Newfoundland and Labrador before returning to Quebec City on 20 July.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{immediately}} guided Palace {{back to the}} Premier League as runaway {{champions of}} the second tier, Chris Armstrong top-scoring with 23 league goals. During this period the badge was changed with the bird being replaced by one which Ron Noades felt more closely resembled an eagle. 1995 again saw the club making news for off the field reasons. On 25 January 1995 Palace played Manchester United at Selhurst Park. Following a bad tackle on Richard Shaw, United's maverick French forward Eric Cantona was sent off. As Cantona walked towards the tunnel he was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons. This angered Cantona, who launched a flying kick at him with <b>both</b> <b>feet.</b> Manchester United suspended Cantona {{for the remainder of}} the season, while the French Football Federation dropped Cantona from the France national football team, and stripped Cantona of the captaincy of Les Bleus. Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail; this was reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal. Simmons was immediately banned from Selhurst Park, and in 1996 was found guilty of two charges of using threatening words and behaviour towards Cantona. More was to follow at Selhurst in March, when Chris Armstrong was suspended by the FA for failing a drugs test. In 1995 Palace reached the semi-finals of both domestic cups, but a shortage of Premier League goals counted against them alongside the introduction of a fourth relegation place. The Premiership was being cut from 22 to 20 clubs at the end of the 1994–95 season, and Palace found themselves demoted on the last day of the season once again.|$|E
