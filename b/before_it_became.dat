5|$|After World War II, the Kanak {{independence}} movement again picked up momentum when the United Nations placed New Caledonia on its Decolonisation List of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1946. A major progression occurred when Kanaks and French {{settlers in the}} country obtained voting rights in 1951, shortly <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> an overseas territory of France in 1956. The Kanaks were then also allowed {{to move out of}} their reserve areas.

5|$|Loring {{was also}} home to many {{facilities}} that {{were a part of}} the base, or were nearby. Caribou Air Force Station was the weapons storage area that operated separately from Loring until it was absorbed in 1961. Caswell Air Force Station operated to the east, but had a unit associated with Loring <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> fully operational. On-base facilities included the Alert Area, which operated as a separate facility within Loring, due to crews being constantly stationed on alert. The Double Cantilever Hangar was the largest hangar at the facility, with the capacity to hold six parked B-52s, or five B-36s.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Gamede {{remained}} a broad system, and by February 24 it produced winds of near gale force up to 670km (415mi) southeast of its center; {{later in the}} day, it passed about 300km (190mi) north of Réunion, its closest point of approach to the island. For over 90hours, the cyclone remained within 400km (250mi) of the island, resulting in torrential rainfall in the island's mountainous region. Radar imagery on the island indicated Gamede maintained an eye diameter of 60–70km (37–43mi). After tracking generally southwestward for several days, a building ridge to its south changed {{the motion of the}} cyclone to the west <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> quasi-stationary. Initially, it was predicted to continue westward and strike Madagascar near Toamasina. The cyclone re-intensified while executing a small loop, and late on February 25 Gamede officially attained peak winds of 165km/h (105mph) about halfway between Réunion island and the coast of Madagascar; at the time, wind gusts in association with the storm reached 230km/h (135mph).|$|E
5|$|Development {{began after}} the release of Tales of Eternia in 2000, taking {{approximately}} two years to complete, and was the last Tales game to be developed by the original Wolfteam <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> Namco Tales Studio. The scenario was handled by Japanese writing company Gekko, the characters were designed by Mutsumi Inomata, and the music was composed by Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura. The PSP port was made after a similar port of Eternia met with commercial success. It was a highly anticipated game, and Namco promoted it heavily in the months prior to release. The game sold over 700,000 units by January 2003, and received critical acclaim from both Japanese and western critics.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the money}} left after Sarah's {{numerous}} bequests was inherited by her grandson, John Spencer, with the condition {{that he could not}} accept a political office under the government. He also inherited the remainder of Sarah's numerous estates, including Wimbledon. Marlborough House remained empty for fourteen years, with the exception of James Stephens, one of her executors, <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> the property of the Dukes of Marlborough upon Stephens's death. In 1817, it became a royal residence, and passed through members of the British royal family until it became the Commonwealth Secretariat in 1959. Wimbledon Park House succumbed to fire in 1785; and Holywell House, Sarah's birthplace in St Albans, was demolished in 1827. Today, much of St Albans is named after the Marlboroughs because of Sarah's influence.|$|E
