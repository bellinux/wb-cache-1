The most prominent of these are refrigerated containers (a.k.a. reefers) for perishable goods, that make up six percent of the world's shipping boxes.

25|$|With the {{expansion}} of agriculture interests throughout the state (along with new rail lines to carry the goods to faraway markets), new communities were founded and existing towns expanded. Agrarian successes led {{to the establishment of}} post offices, schools, churches, mercantile outlets, and ancillary industries such as packing houses. The discovery of brea, more commonly referred to as tar, in Southern California would lead to an oil boom in the early twentieth century. Railroad companies soon discovered that shipping wooden barrels loaded with oil via boxcars was not cost-effective, and developed steel cylindrical tank cars capable of transporting <b>bulk</b> <b>liquids</b> virtually anywhere. By 1915, the transportation of petroleum products had become a lucrative endeavor for western railroads.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{providing}} and sustaining {{a difference in}} pH of a first reaction of an immobilized enzyme and a second reaction in a <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid</b> surrounding the immobilized enzyme is carried out with a bilayer pellet containing coimmobilized enzymes. The pellet can contain an enzyme that produces a desired product immobilized in an inner core and urease immobilized in an outer layer. The <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid</b> contains urea and a substrate for the enzyme in the core, and has an acidic pH. The urease reacts with urea diffusing into the outer layer from the <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid</b> to produce ammonia. The ammonia consumes hydrogen ions diffusing into the inner core from the acidic <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid.</b> This provides the enzyme in the inner core with a pH higher than the acidic pH of the <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid</b> suitable for the enzyme to react with the substrate as it diffuses into the inner core. In a preferred embodiment, simultaneous isomerization of xylose to xylulose and fermentation of xylulose to ethanol is carried out with a bilayer pellet containing xylose isomerase in the core and yeast in the <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid.</b> The isomerization occurs at an optimum pH of 7. 0 to 8. 0 and the fermentation occurs at an optimum pH of 4. 0 to 5. 0...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{mathematical model}} is proposed for modelling a {{moving bed biofilm reactor}} (MBBR) for removal of {{chemical oxygen demand}} (COD) under aerobic conditions. The composite model combines the following: (i) a one-dimensional biofilm model, (ii) a <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid</b> model, and (iii) biological processes in the <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid</b> and biofilm considering the interactions among autotrophic, heterotrophic and predator microorganisms. Depending on the values for the soluble biodegradable COD loading rate (SCLR), the model takes into account a) the hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable compounds in the <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid,</b> and b) the growth of predator microorganisms in the <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid</b> and in the biofilm. The integration of the model and the SCLR allows a general description of the behaviour of COD removal by the MBBR under various conditions. The model is applied for two in-series MBBR wastewater plant from an integrated cellulose and viscose production and accurately describes the experimental concentrations of COD, total suspended solids (TSS), nitrogen and phosphorous obtained during 14 months working at different SCLRs and nutrient dosages. The representation of the microorganism group distribution in the biofilm and in the <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid</b> allow for verification of the presence of predator microorganisms in the second reactor under some operational conditions...|$|R

50|$|In {{response}} {{to the need for}} greater improved movement of <b>bulk</b> <b>liquids,</b> tank containers were invented in the mid 1960 by Bob Fossey who worked for Wiliams Fairclough in London. This first tank was a beam type designed in 1967 built onto a swap body design from Fossey in 1966. The eighties and early nineties saw two different trends. One was a quest to make the tank container both lighter and have a greater capacity. Through the following decades tanks have evolved to become a lighter and more space efficient means of transporting <b>bulk</b> <b>liquids.</b>|$|E
