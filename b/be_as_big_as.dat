25|$|G. aurea is a {{perennial}} herb that forms small, compact rosettes composed of nearly linear leaves about 2mm wide. Leaves are typically 5–50mm in length, {{but most of}} that length, including the petiole, is hidden beneath the soil. The rosettes can grow to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> 5cm wide. It has no true roots and instead has highly modified subterranean leaves that act as the carnivorous trapping mechanism.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, the bay {{was subject}} to the Reber Plan, which would have filled {{in parts of the}} bay in order to {{increase}} industrial activity along the waterfront. In 1959, the United States Army Corps of Engineers released a report stating that if current infill trends continued, the bay would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> a shipping channel by 2020. This news created the Save the Bay movement in 1960, which mobilized to stop the infill of wetlands and the bay in general, which had shrunk to two-thirds of its size in the century before 1961.|$|E
25|$|Forwards tend to run {{straight}} and {{hard at the}} opposition, while the backs run at gaps between players or use speed and guile to run around them. In modern games of rugby some backs can <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> forwards and attempt {{to break through the}} defensive line using brute force and many forwards possess the running skills of backs. Players run straight at the opposition with the aim of either breaking the tackle or getting forward momentum from which to set up another attack. If they are close to the try line they can drive in low to aid grounding the ball. Players can also try to break through tackles by spinning after making contact or by using the hand not carrying the ball to fend (push) off the defender.|$|E

500|$|For the {{character}} of Giselle, her journey to becoming a real woman is reflected in her dresses, which become less fairy tale-like as the film progresses. Her wedding dress {{at the beginning of}} the film directly contrasts her modern gown at the end of the film. The wedding dress served to provide a [...] "humongous contrast to the flat drawings" [...] and to accentuate the image of a Disney Princess. In order to make the waist look small, the sleeves are designed to be [...] "extremely pouffy" [...] and the skirt to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> possible, which included a metal hoop that holds up 20 layers of petticoats and ruffles. Altogether, eleven versions of the dress are made for filming, each made of 200 yards (183 m) of silk satin and other fabric, and weighing approximately 40 pounds (18kg). On the experience of wearing the wedding dress, Amy Adams described it as [...] "grueling" [...] since [...] "the entire weight was on her hips, so occasionally it felt like she was in traction".|$|E
500|$|Congress had by the Act of March 3, 1863 {{authorized}} fractional {{currency in}} the denomination of 3 cents; when these notes reached circulation {{the following year}} they proved wildly unpopular. The 1864 law which had substituted bronze for copper-nickel had also outlawed [...] "copperheads" [...] or private token issues. Even though these could now only be issued anonymously, and so could not be redeemed, the copperheads were preferred to the 3-cent shinplasters. [...] Some copperhead tokens even read [...] "Substitute for shinplasters". The notes soon became filthy and ragged, making them even more disliked. They were more difficult to value in quantity than notes with denominations divisible by five. According to Walter Breen, [...] "This was the moment Wharton's supporters had been waiting for." [...] Wharton and his advocates argued that the three-cent notes should be redeemed with equivalent coins. They contended that were Congress to order a three-cent bronze coin, such a piece would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> an obsolete large cent, and {{might be used to}} deceive the blind into accepting the pre-1857 cent rather than the more valuable coin. Pollock, previously an opponent of nickel coinage, {{had a change of heart}} and became a supporter.|$|E
500|$|Jam and Lewis {{were the}} primary instrumentalists for the recording, {{including}} percussion, piano, drums, and also provided background vocals. Jackson accompanied Jam and Lewis on keyboard and took part in composing the arrangements. Stephen Holden of The New York Times observed the album was prominent example of the developing relationship with musicians and modern technology, stating [...] "...technology has altered the form, shape, scale and even the meaning of popular music... The album wasn't created by a studio band, as were most pop-rock albums in the 1960s and '70s, but by the producers and the singer programming mechanized drum and keyboard textures." [...] Jackson's father disapproved of the new material and image of Control, claiming it would never sell. In a cover story for Spin magazine titled [...] "Damn It, Janet: The Battle for Control of Janet Jackson," [...] Joseph was reported saying [...] "f Janet listens to me, she'll <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> Michael." [...] She and McClain disregarded his objections. Commenting on the final product, Jackson stated: [...] "It's aggressive, cocky, very forward. It expresses exactly who I am and how I feel. I've taken control of my own life. This time I'm gonna do it my way." ...|$|E

Scott of At The Movies also {{compared}} his {{viewing of}} the film to {{the first time he}} viewed Star Wars and he said [...] "although the script is a little bit... obvious," [...] it was [...] "part of what made it work". Todd McCarthy of Variety praised the film, saying [...] "The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in Avatar, and it's very much a place worth visiting." [...] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review. [...] "The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention," [...] he stated. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded Avatar a three-and-a-half out of four star rating and wrote in his print review [...] "It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> his dreams." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine thought that the film was [...] "the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times thought the film has [...] "powerful" [...] visual accomplishments but [...] "flat dialogue" [...] and [...] "obvious characterization". James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars; he wrote [...] "In 3-D, it's immersive– but the traditional film elements– story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc.– are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2½-hour experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Li {{discussed}} {{his commitment to}} philanthropy {{in an interview with}} the December 2009 issue of Alliance magazine, stating that [...] "grassroots non-government organizations can help the government in its blind spots.

[...] By the time of his presidency, Wilson hoped that presidents could be party leaders in the same way British prime ministers were. Wilson also hoped that the parties could be reorganized along ideological, not geographic, lines. He wrote, [...] "Eight words contain the sum of the present degradation of our political parties: No leaders, no principles; no principles, no parties." ...|$|E

The boy reveals little that Golaud wants to know since he is too innocent to understand what he is asking. He says that Pelléas and Mélisande often quarrel about the door {{and that they have}} told Yniold he will one day <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> his father. Golaud is puzzled when learning that they (Pelléas and Mélisande) never send Yniold away because they are afraid when he is not there and keep on crying in the dark. He admits that he once saw Pelléas and Mélisande kiss [...] "when it was raining". Golaud lifts his son on his shoulders to spy on Pelléas and Mélisande through the window but Yniold says that they are doing nothing other than looking at the light. He threatens to scream unless Golaud lets him down again. Golaud leads him away.|$|E

Daley, however, noted that [...] "unlike their ’98 hit, this sleeper isn’t {{likely to make}} a major dent in your Most Played list — while it seems to have the right ingredients, strong vocals, and an empowering message, it suffers from watered-down couplets about Facebook and Macbooks and a beat that isn’t quite catchy enough." [...] She also compared it to Beyoncé's [...] "Irreplaceable", commenting that the duet is a new version [...] "with two leads and more juvenile lyrics." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator considered it a [...] "snappy R tune", and said that it's [...] "nice to see these two ladies finally getting along!" [...] AOL Music's Kenneth Partridge commented on the track, saying, [...] "they've been burned by their fellas, and they they're not shy about showing some sisterly solidarity and standing up for themselves."

Sandé {{revealed}} that she wanted to bring poetry back into music, as it has been lost. The songs which are currently being released are for the [...] "moment" [...] as they make us feel good and we can dance to them, Sandé said. She said that Our Version of Events will see poetry lyrics, as she intends to bring them back into fashion. She said; Great songwriters come along quite rarely, but when I listen to Tracy Chapman or Joni Mitchell, these are people who pay attention to the lyric and are precise about it. I feel that has been put second to having a cool producer or whether the kids will like it. She said that the music industry is hard to get into, but once you are in, it is very loyal. In the recording studio, Syco Music heard some of Sandé's songs which they wanted, but she refused and told them she wanted to keep them for her own album. They later asked her to write for some of their artists, and Leona Lewis went into the studio with her and Naughty Boy to record for a couple of weeks, and she said that her and Lewis had a lot in common. She also said that Lewis has a phenomenal voice and she was lovely.|$|E
