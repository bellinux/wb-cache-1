25|$|Total <b>body</b> <b>iron</b> averages {{approximately}} 3.8 g {{in men and}} 2.3 g in women. In blood plasma, iron {{is carried}} tightly bound to the protein transferrin. There are several mechanisms that control human iron metabolism and safeguard against iron deficiency. The main regulatory mechanism is situated in the gastrointestinal tract. When loss of iron is not sufficiently compensated by adequate intake of iron from the diet, a state of iron deficiency develops over time. When this state is uncorrected, it leads to iron deficiency anemia. Before anemia occurs, the medical condition of Iron Deficiency without anemia is called Latent Iron Deficiency (LID) or Iron-deficient erythropoiesis (IDE).|$|E
25|$|Chronic iron {{toxicity}} {{is usually}} the result of more chronic iron overload syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes. In such cases the iron stores of an adult may reach 50grams (10 times normal total <b>body</b> <b>iron)</b> or more. Classic examples of genetic iron overload includes hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and the more severe disease juvenile hemochromatosis (JH) caused by mutations in either the gene RGMc gene, {{a member of a}} three gene repulsive guidance molecule family, (also called hemojuvelin (HJV), and HFE2), Hemojuvelin, or the HAMP gene that encodes (an iron regulatory peptide). The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic iron overload disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes.|$|E
2500|$|Haemochromatosis (or hemochromatosis) type 1 (also HFE {{hereditary}} haemochromatosis or HFE-related hereditary haemochromatosis) is a {{hereditary disease}} characterized by excessive intestinal absorption of dietary iron {{resulting in a}} pathological increase in total <b>body</b> <b>iron</b> stores. Humans, like most animals, have no means to excrete excess iron.|$|E

2500|$|Serum Ferritin: Ferritin, {{a protein}} {{synthesized}} by the liver {{is the primary}} form of iron storage within cells and tissues. [...] Measuring ferritin provides another crude estimate of whole <b>body</b> <b>iron</b> stores though many conditions, particularly inflammation (but also chronic alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and others), can elevate serum ferritin - which can account for up to 90% of cases where elevated levels are observed. Normal values for males are 12–300ng/ml (nanograms per millilitre) and for female, 12–150ng/ml. Serum ferritin in excess of 1000 nanograms per millilitre of blood is almost always attributable to haemochromatosis.|$|E

25|$|Human iron {{metabolism}} is the set {{of chemical}} reactions that maintain human homeostasis of iron at both the systemic and cellular level. The control of this necessary but potentially toxic metal {{is an important part}} of many aspects of human health and disease. Hematologists have been especially interested in systemic iron metabolism because iron is essential for red blood cells, where most of the human <b>body's</b> <b>iron</b> is contained. Understanding iron metabolism is also important for understanding diseases of iron overload, such as hereditary hemochromatosis, and iron deficiency, such as iron deficiency anemia.|$|R
50|$|Hemopexin binds heme {{with the}} highest {{affinity}} of any known protein. Its function is scavenging the heme released or lost by the turnover of heme proteins such as hemoglobin and thus protects the body from the oxidative damage that free heme can cause. In addition, hemopexin releases its bound ligand for internalisation upon interacting with a specific receptor situated {{on the surface of}} liver cells. This function of hemopexin is to preserve the <b>body's</b> <b>iron.</b> Hemopexin, an acute phase protein, can downregulate the angiotensin (ang) II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) in vitro.|$|R

5000|$|The {{severity}} of iron overload {{can be determined}} and monitored {{using a combination of}} tests. Measurement of serum ferritin indicates for total <b>body</b> <b>iron</b> overload. [...] Liver biopsy measures the iron concentration of liver. It provides the microscopic examination of the liver. Measurement of serum hepcidin levels may be useful in diagnostic for iron overload. MRI can detect the degree of magnetic disruption due to iron accumulation. MRI can measure iron accumulation within the heart, liver, and pituitary. Accumulation of iron in a single organ does not provide proper representation of the total <b>body</b> <b>iron</b> overload.|$|E

The balance between serum transferrin saturation and serum transferrin-receptor concentrations determines which of these functions predominates. With this input, HFE enables the intestinal crypt cells and reticuloendothelial system to interpret the <b>body's</b> <b>iron</b> requirements and regulate iron absorption and distribution.

50|$|Anemia {{is often}} first shown by routine blood tests, which {{generally}} include a {{complete blood count}} (CBC) which is performed by an instrument which gives an output {{as a series of}} index numbers. A sufficiently low hemoglobin (Hb) by definition makes the diagnosis of anemia, and a low hematocrit value is also characteristic of anemia. Further studies will be undertaken to determine the anemia's cause. If the anemia is due to iron deficiency, one of the first abnormal values to be noted on a CBC, as the <b>body's</b> <b>iron</b> stores begin to be depleted, will be a high red blood cell distribution width (RDW), reflecting an increased variability in the size of red blood cells (RBCs). In the course of slowly depleted iron status, an increasing RDW normally appears even before anemia appears.|$|R
