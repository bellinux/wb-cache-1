2500|$|The <b>bursa</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabricius</b> is a {{circular}} pouch {{connected to the}} superior dorsal side of the cloaca [...] The bursa is composed of many folds, known as plica, which are lined by more than 10,000 follicles encompassed by connective tissue and surrounded by mesenchyme. Each follicle consists of a cortex that surrounds a medulla. The cortex houses the highly compacted B lymphocytes, whereas the medulla houses lymphocytes loosely. [...] The medulla is separated from the lumen by the epithelium and this aids in the transport of epithelial cells into the lumen of the bursa. There are 150,000 B lymphocytes located around each follicle.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this 42 -day study was to {{investigate}} the effects of methionine (Met) deficiency on immune function by determining the relative weight, morphological and ultrastructural changes <b>of</b> <b>bursae</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fabricius,</b> cell cycle, and apoptosis <b>of</b> <b>bursa</b> cells. One hundred and twenty one-day-old avian broilers were randomly divided into two groups and fed on a control diet (starter diet, Met 0. 50 %; grower diet, Met 0. 40 %) and Met-deficient diet (starter diet, Met 0. 26 %; grower diet, Met 0. 28 %) for six weeks. The relative weight <b>of</b> <b>bursae</b> was decreased with Met deficiency when compared to that of the control group. Lesions were also observed in the Met-deficient group. Histopathologically, the numbers of lymphocytes in the follicles were decreased. Ultrastructurally, the mitochondria of lymphocytes were swollen in the Met-deficient group. As measured by flow cytometry, bursal cells in the G 0 G 1 phase were significantly higher (P < 0. 01), and bursal cells in the S, G 2 M phases and proliferating index were obviously lower (P < 0. 01) with Met deficiency than in the control group. Moreover, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the bursae were significantly increased in Met-deficient birds (P < 0. 01).

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to determine the}} influences of heat stress and temperature-exposed time on liver malonaldehyde (MDA), relative weight <b>of</b> <b>bursa</b> <b>fabricius</b> and heterophil/lymfocite ratio of broilers. The research used 140 male broilers of 2 weeks of age. The treatments consisted of two factors. The first factor was five treatments: S 1 A (28. 55 ? 1. 53 oC) with ad libitum of feeding, S 1 BT 1 (S 1 with pair feeding as S 2 A), S 1 BT 2 (S 1 with pair feeding as S 3 A), S 2 A (31. 07 ? 1. 29 oC) with ad libitum of feeding and S 3 A (33. 50 ? 1. 17 oC) with ad libitum of feeding. The second factor was five of temperature-exposed times (0, 4, 8, 16, and 32 days after treatments). Variables measured were liver MDA, relative weight <b>of</b> <b>bursa</b> <b>fabricius</b> and ratio <b>of</b> heterophil/lymphocite (H/L). The experiment used a completely randomized design in split plot (5 x 5), with 4 replications. The result indicated that liver MDA, relative weight <b>of</b> <b>bursa</b> <b>fabricius</b> and H/L ratio of S 2 and S 3 were higher than those of S 1 A, S 1 BT 1 and S 1 BT 2. H/L ratio of 4, 8, 16, and 32 days of temperature-exposed times were higher than that of 0 day. It was concluded that heat stress increased the liver MDA and H/L ratio, but decreased the relative weight <b>of</b> <b>bursa</b> <b>fabricius.</b> The temperature-exposed time increased the H/L ratio, but it did not affect the liver MDA and relative weight <b>of</b> <b>bursa</b> <b>fabricius</b> <b>of</b> broilers...|$|R

5|$|Barn owls are hosts to a {{wide range}} of parasites. Fleas are present at nesting sites and {{externally}} the birds are attacked by feather lice and feather mites which chew the barbules of the feathers and which are transferred from bird to bird by direct contact. Blood-sucking flies such as Ornithomyia avicularia are often present, moving about among the plumage. Internal parasites include the fluke Strigea strigis, the tape worm Paruternia candelabraria, several species of parasitic round worm and spiny-headed worms in the genus Centrorhynchus. These gut parasites are acquired when the birds feed on infected prey which provide intermediate hosts for the parasites. There is some indication that female birds with more and larger spots have a greater resistance to external parasites. This is correlated with smaller <b>bursae</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fabricius,</b> glands associated with antibody production, and a lower fecundity of the blood-sucking fly Carnus hemapterus that attacks nestlings.|$|R
40|$|Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) {{destroys the}} proliferating {{lymphocytes}} in the <b>bursae</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fabricius</b> <b>of</b> chicken. Chickens either die with acute infection or, if survive, become immunosu p pressed and therefore highly susceptible to other lethal diseases. Many strains have been isolated {{in different countries}} and they vary in the pathogenicity. Different strains are typed by the gene sequence of the major coat protein of the virus: VP 2, which bears the neutralizing epitopes. VP 2 is a polypeptide of approximated 40 kDa, which is derived from a precursor polyprotein. In this study, IBDV virus was isolated from <b>bursae</b> <b>of</b> local infected chicken collected by the Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) of the Hong Kong Government, using a simplified procedure. By alignment of the gene sequences of all the published strains. oligonucleotides were designed to amplified the VP 2 gene of the local strains by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The sequences of the amplified VP 2 gene indicated that two strains, including a highly virulent IBDV strain which was discovered in Japan in 1990 and an unpublished variant of IBDV, were prevalent in Hong Kong.

The aim was to disclose the mechanism behind the clinical disease symptoms. Three groups of specific pathogen free chickens were used for the experiment. Chickens in groups 1 and 3 were pretreated with 5 -FU, while chickens in group 2 were treated with a placebo. After five days, the chickens in groups 2 and 3 were inoculated with the classical IBDV strain F 52 / 70. <b>Bursae</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fabricius</b> were sampled at fixed intervals, and the progress of the infection was monitored by various histological techniques and RT-PCR. We found correlation between histological observations and RT-PCR results. In the 5 -FU pretreated chickens, IBDV caused only mild clinical symptoms, even though histological alterations, similar to alterations caused by IBDV were still observed. The 5 -FU pretreatment resulted in severe heterophil granulocyte depletion by days 2 and 3 after infection (p. i.) and increased numbers of bursal secretory dendritic cells in the medulla of the follicles. IBDV infection seemed to induce fusion of secretory dendritic cells, resulting in formation of multinucleated giant cells, loaded with apoptotic B cells and virus particles associated with granules of bursal secretory dendritic cells. Our results indicate that the heterophil granulocytes together with the bursal secretory dendritic cells contribute to the outbreak and/or progress of clinical symptoms...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of different levels of zinc on some productive parameters of broiler breeder, an experiment was conducted with 300 hens and 40 roosters of Ross 308 strain (40 wk old) in 12 week period in completely randomized design with 4 treatments, 5 replicates and 15 hens and 2 roosters in each replicate. Treatments consisted of 4 different levels of zinc (80, 110, 140 and 170 mg zinc/kg diet) in which the dietary zinc was supplied from zinc sulfate. Zinc supplementation significantly improved egg production, egg weight, egg shell quality and feed conversion ratio during the experiment. Production percentage and feed conversion ratio had the best results in 170 mg zinc/kg diet and the best results of egg weight and egg shell quality were observed in 140 and 170 mg zinc/kg diet. Zinc supplementation improved the weight and quality of neonatal chicks.

Several plants produce {{bioactive}} compounds which are very useful for treatment of many disease, especially hiperproliveration and virus infection. This study was aimed to find out mechanism of immuno-modulatory capacity in layer commercial chicken administered orally with extract of tea parasite (Scurrula oortiana) in dose of 10 mg/kg BW through drinking water, then the chicken were infected by intraperitoneal oncogenic MDV in dose of 1, 0 x 103 TCID 50. The study used 60 layer commercial day old chicks (DOC) divided into four group treatments.
