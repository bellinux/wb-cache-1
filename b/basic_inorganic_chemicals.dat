5000|$|Allocation {{can act as}} a {{means of}} {{addressing}} concerns over loss of competitiveness, and possible [...] "leakage" [...] (carbon leakage) of emissions outside the EU. Leakage is the effect of emissions increasing in countries or sectors that have weaker regulation of emissions than the regulation in another country or sector. Such concerns affect the following sectors: cement, steel, aluminium, pulp and paper, <b>basic</b> <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> and fertilisers/ammonia. Leakage from these sectors was thought to be under 1% of total EU emissions. Correcting for leakage by allocating permits acts as a temporary subsidy for affected industries, but does not fix the underlying problem. Border adjustments would be the economically efficient choice, where imports are taxed according to their carbon content. One problem with border adjustments is that they might be used as a disguise for trade protectionism. Some adjustments may also not prevent emissions leakage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In Italy {{there are}} 25 Large Industrial Point Sources whose mercury {{emissions}} in air exceed the established threshold of 10 kg year- 1. Many of these mercury point sources, mostly distributed along the Italian coastal area, are located at sites qualified as National Interest Rehabilitation Sites because of documented contamination in qualitative and/or quantitative terms and of potential health impact. Atmospheric mercury emissions related to Italian Large Industrial Point Sources, with {{a value of}} 1. 04 Mg·yr- 1 for 2007, have a not negligible contribution, accounting, on their own, for more than 10 % of the total mercury emissions resulting from all activity sectors at a national level.

40|$|A {{kraft paper}} mill {{produces}} a steady waste stream of reacted <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> and organic wastes called black liquor. Both monetary and environmental concerns {{demand that the}} <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> and the organic byproducts are recycled. Currently recovery boilers are the standard means to recycle the <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> and organic waste to produce a large fraction of the energy needed to operate a large pulp and paper mill. Energy {{research has indicated that}} gasification of the black liquor would recover the <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> and meet a mills heat / steam requirements. In addition, gasification would produce fuel gas that can then be used to generate electricity that will meet or exceed the needs of a pulp and paper mill. Unfortunately, regeneration of the <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemicals</b> produces a highly corrosive Na 2 CO 3 and Na 2 S smelt. This smelt melts at about 700 °C and can produce an environment conducive to stress corrosion cracking in the composite tubes lining the recovery boiler, or can cause rapid degradation of the refractory liners in gasifiers. Numerous studies have addressed various aspects of these problems. This paper summarizes the contributions of X-ray and neutron diffraction to the materials issues in recovery boilers and black liquor gasifiers. Figure 1.
