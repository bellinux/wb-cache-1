40|$|Abstract Assessing and {{monitoring}} landscape pattern structure from multi-scale land-cover maps can utilize morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), only if various influences of scale are known and taken into account. This paper lays {{part of the}} foundation for applying MSPA analysis in landscape monitoring by quantifying scale effects on six classes of spatial patterns called: core, edge, perforation, <b>branch,</b> <b>connector</b> and islet. Four forest maps were selected with different forest composition and configuration. The sensitivity of MSPA to scale was studied by comparing frequencies of pattern classes in total forest area for various combinations of pixel size (P) and size parameter (S).

Differences in initial composition and configuration influence the amount but not the general tendencies of the variations of morphological spatial pattern (MSP) class proportions with scale. Increase of P led to data generalization resulting in either a removal of the small size features or their potential transformation into other non-core MSP classes, while an increase of S decreases the MSP core area and this process may transform small core areas into the MSP class islet. We established that the behavior of the MSPA classes with changing scale can be categorized as consistent and robust scaling relations in the forms of linear, power, or logarithmic functions over a range of scales.

2500|$|A {{passageway}} may {{consist of}} two or more parallel lines that take different routes between the same cities, <b>branch</b> and <b>connector</b> lines, and in some cases, connecting lines and lower-speed lines. [...] The Beijing-Shanghai HSR Passageway, one of the verticals, comprises the preexisting Beijing-Shanghai HSR, which runs through Tianjin, Jinan, Bengbu, Nanjing, Wuxi and Suzhou, as well as a new high-speed passenger dedicated line from Beijing to Shanghai via Tianjin, Dongying, Weifang, Linyi, Huaian, Yangzhou, and Nantong, as well as HSRs connecting Nanjing, Hefei and Shanghai with Hangzhou. [...] Some passageways consists of a single HSR line; the Shanghai-Kunming HSR Passageway, one of the horizontals, is essentially the Shanghai–Kunming High-Speed Railway by another name.|$|R

The company <b>branched</b> into custom <b>connector</b> design, which has become its chief manufacturing method. Onanon uses multiple head automation in its manufacturing process, which increases the number of units that can be produced. The company has a proprietary “breadboard” panel array manufacturing method that allows engineers to build functionality directly into the connector, which saves costs for the buyer and adds functionality to the connector. Onanon employs a sales staff that is also trained as engineers, which allows the company to guarantee fast turnaround times for shipments placed by customers.|$|R

We define a representation model for software architecture concepts. The model is based on MY model (meta modeling in Y), which is a knowledge engineering methodology. It represents software architecture concepts using three branches: component, connector, and architecture. The component branch represents concepts that are related to computations, the <b>connector</b> <b>branch</b> represents concepts that are related to interactions, and the architecture branch represents concepts that are related to the structure and the topology of the system described. We think that such a representation of architecture concepts aids in improving reusability not only at the implementation level, but also at the description level. The model assigns a hierarchical library for the four software architecture conceptual levels (meta-meta architecture level, meta architecture level, architecture level, application level) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the following problem: given two business process models, create a process model {{that is the}} union of the process models given as input. In other words, {{the behavior of the}} produced process model should encompass that of the input models. The paper describes an algorithm that produces a single configurable process model from a pair of process models. The algorithm works by extracting the common parts of the input process models, creating a single copy of them, and appending the differences as <b>branches</b> of configurable <b>connectors.</b> This way, the merged process model is kept as small as possible, while still capturing all the behavior of the input models. Moreover, analysts are able to trace back which model(s) a given element in the merged model originates from. The algorithm has been prototyped and tested against process models taken from several application domains...|$|R
50|$|To {{be of use}} for {{connecting}} molecules, MWs need to self-assemble following well-defined {{routes and}} form reliable electrical contacts between them. To reproducibly self-assemble a complex circuit based on single molecules. Ideally, they would connect to diverse materials, such as gold metal surfaces (for connections to outside world), biomolecules (for nanosensors, nanoelectrodes, molecular switches) and most importantly, they must allow <b>branching.</b> The <b>connectors</b> should also be available of pre-determined diameter and length. They should also have covalent bonding to ensure reproducible transport and contact properties. DNA-like molecules have specific molecular-scale recognition {{and can be used}} in molecular scaffold fabrication. Complex shapes have been demonstrated, but unfortunately metal coated DNA which is electrically conducting is too thick to connect to individual molecules. Thinner coated DNA lacks electronic connectivity and is unsuited for connecting molecular electronics components. Some varieties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are conducting, and connectivity at their ends can be achieved by attachment of connecting groups. Unfortunately manufacturing CNTs with pre-determined properties is impossible at present, and the functionalized ends are typically not conducting, limiting their usefulness as molecular connectors. Individual CNTs can be soldered in an electron microscope, but the contact is not covalent and cannot be self-assembled. Possible routes for the construction of larger functional circuits using Mo6S9−xIx MWs have been demonstrated, either via gold nanoparticles as linkers, or by direct connection to thiolated molecules. The two approaches may lead to different possible applications. The use of GNPs offers the possibility of branching and construction of larger circuits.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{perceived}} {{realism of}} simulated maps with contagion (spatial autocorrelation) {{has led to}} their use for comparing landscape pattern metrics and as habitat maps for modeling organism movement across landscapes. The objective {{of this study was}} to conduct a neutral model analysis of pattern metrics defined by morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) on maps with contagion, with comparisons to phase transitions (abrupt changes) of patterns on simple random maps. Using MSPA, each focal class pixel on a neutral map was assigned to one of six pattern classes—core, edge, perforated, <b>connector,</b> <b>branch,</b> or islet—depending on MSPA rules for connectivity and edge width. As the density of the focal class (P) was increased on simple random maps, the proportions of pixels in different pattern classes exhibited two types of phase transitions at threshold densities (0. 41 B P B 0. 99) that were predicted by percolation theory after taking into account the MSPA rules for connectivity and edge width. While there was no evidence of phase transitions on maps with contagion, the general trends of pattern metrics in relation to P were similar to simple random maps. Using an index P for comparisons, the effect of increasing contagion was opposite that of increasing edge width...|$|R

5000|$|The first Canadian transcontinental railway was {{constructed}} by the Canadian Pacific Railway between 1881 and 1885. [...] The first proposal was northerly through the Saskatchewan provisional district of the North-West Territories to support the fur trade. The final established route was through the Assiniboia provisional district of the North-West Territories. Towns such as Moosomin, Qu'Appelle, Regina, Moose Jaw and Swift Current sprang up along the railway and became trade centres. [...] The new economy saw grain and agricultural farming as a viable alternative, and Clifford Sifton implemented a massive immigration policy in support of settling the West. The rail lines followed the established trails generally as the most practical method of travelling through the prairies. After the great east-west transcontinental railway was built, north-south <b>connector</b> <b>branch</b> lines were established. In 1885, the Regina and Long Lake railroad connected Regina and Craven. The railway was eventually expanded north to Prince Albert. [...] The Regina and Long Lake railroad or The Qu'Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway crossed the South Saskatchewan River at Saskatoon, Hub city in 1890. [...] In 1907 the communities of Melville, The Rail Centre, and Biggar, Saskatchewan [...] became divisional points for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. [...] Moose Jaw, dubbed Little Chicago, was the northern terminus on the Soo Line, which ran to Chicago, and provided a route during the prohibition years for alcohol freighting between Canada and the United States. The 1920s saw the largest rise in rail line track as the CPR and CNR fell into competition to provide rail service within ten kilometres. In the 1960s there were applications for abandonment of branch lines.|$|R
