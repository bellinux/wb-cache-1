5000|$|The {{site has}} diverse {{habitats}} of grassland, woods, hedges, scrub, ponds and marsh. The grassland is grazed by rabbits, and invertebrates include minotaur beetles and <b>bee</b> <b>wolf</b> wasps. The woodland is mainly oak, ash and hawthorn, and the pond banks have reedmace and reed sweet-grass.|$|E
5000|$|Henry Sweet, a philologist {{and early}} {{linguist}} specializing in Germanic languages, {{proposed that the}} name Bēowulf literally means in Old English [...] "bee-wolf" [...] or [...] "bee-hunter" [...] {{and that it is}} a kenning for [...] "bear". This etymology is mirrored in recorded instances of similar names. Biuuuwulf is recorded as a name in the AD 1031 Liber Vitae. The name is attested to a monk from Durham and literally means <b>bee</b> <b>wolf</b> in Northumbrian. The 11th century English Domesday Book contains a recorded instance of the name Beulf. A scholar named Sarrazin also suggested that the name Beowulf was derived from a mistranslation of Böðvarr where -varr was interpreted as vargr meaning [...] "wolf". However, this etymology was questioned by Sophus Bugge, who instead suggested that the personage Böðvarr Bjarki was derived from Beowulf.|$|E

50|$|Glenview {{is home to}} a rich {{variety of}} animals. These animals coexist with the human {{residents}} of Glenview and thrive in the many forest preserves that call Glenview home. The most frequently spotted birds in Glenview include robins, sparrows, cardinals, crows, Canada geese, mallard ducks, and occasionally great horned owls. In residential areas, squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, rats and mice cohabit with people. On nature walks through the Glen, the forest preserves, or The Grove, one can come upon white tailed deer, and an occasional coyote or fox. Also to be seen are brown rabbits, cicadas (both the 17-year and the 4-year varieties), box and alligator snapping turtles, and sometimes small frogs and toads. Among the arthropods and insects seen in Glenview are ants, <b>bees,</b> mosquitoes, daddy-long-legs, <b>wolf</b> spiders, and many others.|$|R
5000|$|The book is {{organised}} into chapters detailing different animals {{and their ability}} to use their natural advantages for greatest endurance and explains how Heinrich used this knowledge to become an ultra-runner. Why We Run focuses on how antelope, deer, <b>wolves,</b> <b>bees,</b> frogs, camels and other animals exhibit endurance techniques that humans later adopted. For example, antelopes travel in packs and [...] "leap frog" [...] from back to front to conserve energy and escape predators. Deer are natural sprinters and sprint to escape predators. Wolves, like endurance runners, chase sprinting prey to tire them. Camels are adapted to fat storage and usage in order to conserve water in their harsh environment. Birds have a majority of slow twitch fibrous muscles that are adapted for long travel times as well as the ability to simultaneously inhale and exhale. The book concludes as Heinrich completes an ultra-marathon and reflects on the biology, anthropology, psychology and philosophy that affected his life along with the animals and their metabolic functions.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} study of {{discrimination}} of photic intensity by the honey bee, and certain experimental results, {{have been described}} (Wolf, 1932 - 33). It was shown that the bee's discriminating power for different brightnesses varies with illumination {{in much the same}} way that this function does for the human eye (Koenig and Brodhun, 1889; Hecht, 1924 - 25). The discriminating power is poor at low illuminations; as the intensity of illumination increases the discrimination increases, ultimately less rapidly, until it reaches a certain level at high illuminations. The total range over which the bee can distinguish between different intensities was found to be very much smaller than for the human eye, and at an illumination where the discriminating power of the human eye and of the bee's eye are at their best, the intensity discrimination by the bee is one-twentieth as good as that by the human eye. The experiments by which these results were obtained were made under "optimal " conditions as regards the visual acuity of the bee's eye; for test object a pattern of stripes was chosen which could be easily reacted to even at the lowest illuminations used during the experiment. The visual acuity of the human eye varies with illumination in such a way that at low illuminations the resolving power is poor; at higher illuminations it increases, until it finally reaches a maximum level (Koenig, 1897; Hecht, 1927 - 28). The same kind of relationship was found for the facetted eye of the <b>bee</b> (Hecht and <b>Wolf,</b> 1928 - 29). While the relation between visual acuity and illumination is the same in principle for the two organisms, there is a tremendous difference i...|$|R
