According to 2007-2012 State Department data from U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, Amarillo received {{the highest number of}} refugees per capita than any other Texas city. According to Harpole, the city has struggled with accommodating a high number of foreign language speakers in areas like education and 911 response. Harpole told the Texas Tribune, [...] "We’ve raised some red flags and said this isn’t good for some entities in the city or for the refugees themselves". Many refugees worked in meatpacking plants in the area, but Harpole expressed concern that jobs were declining and believed [...] "it’s going to be more difficult for the refugees to do well" [...] in Amarillo. After requests from Harpole, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission agreed with various refugee resettlement organizations in late 2013 that new placements in Amarillo would be limited to family reunification. However, Harpole wished to make clear, [...] "We don’t want to get the idea out that we are not supportive of refugees.

To answer that question, we compute Bayes factors, the deviance information criterion and the posterior mean of the logarithmic discrepancy. We apply these Bayesian model comparison criteria to two real data sets obtaining interesting results.

40|$|Purpose: This article compares four {{different}} employee activities, namely developmental appraisal, coaching, 360 degree feedback and development centres, offering a comparative framework and an integration of existing research evidence. Approach: We propose a unifying classification which combines existing dimensions {{derived from the}} literature, such as the degree of formality (e. g. Birdi et al., 1997), with further differences or communalities such as the degree of simulation, ownership of data and frequency of occurrence. This leads us to {{a review of the}} pertinent literature and research evidence {{for each of the four}} activities discussed, with particular reference to long-term outcomes, their social context as well as individual motivation. Research and practical implications: We propose that our classification framework could guide both the implementation and evaluation of diverse activities beyond those reviewed here. We argue that our framework may prove effective in making explicit and thus addressing the potentially conflicting expectations for prevalent activities from different parties involved. We propose that certain aspects of employee development, such as the employer-manager relationship may be more suited to investigation through qualitative paradigms, <b>but</b> that ultimately <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> more evidence for long term outcomes at different levels (e. g. the individual and the organization) ...|$|R

Our proof is based on induction, {{with the help of}} restriction and induction functors, but with non trivial first steps, consisting in the study of quivers with one vertex <b>but</b> possible loops. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to consider regularity conditions on the support of our perverse sheaves to perform efficient restrictions at imaginary vertices. From our proof emerges a new combinatorial structure on our generalized canonical basis, which is more general than the usual crystals, in that there are now more operators associated to a vertex with loops. In a second part, we construct and study a Hopf algebra which generalizes the usual quantum groups. The geometric study previously made leads to a natural definition, which includes countably infinite sets of generators at imaginary roots, with higher order Serre relations and commutativity conditions imposed by the Jordan quiver case.
