The author examines whether welfare-improving <b>buybacks</b> would arise at the"fair"price. If so, policy intervention is needed to remove the distortion. In a model of intertemporal consumption smoothing, <b>buybacks</b> at the fair price are desirable if the country experiences unusually heavy export earnings and if large reserve holdings tend to increase transfers to creditors in default states. Concerted agreements in which debt repurchases are linked to cuts in interest rates or new money requirements can make <b>buybacks</b> at the fair price viable, while preventing the free-rider problem among lenders.

In addition to maintaining the resale value, Tesla hoped to secure a supply of used cars to refurbish and re-sell with warranty. According to Automotive News, the profit margin on used car sales in the U.S. is about triple that on new cars, and Tesla's direct sales would allow it capture resale profits.

25|$|Capital {{budgeting}} is {{also concerned}} with the setting of criteria about which projects should receive investment funding to increase {{the value of the}} firm, and whether to finance that investment with equity or debt capital.

Projects that increase a firm's value may include a wide variety of different types of investments, including but not limited to, expansion policies, or mergers and acquisitions.

25|$|A {{capital gain}} {{should not be}} {{confused}} with a dividend. Generally, a capital gain occurs where a capital asset is sold for an amount greater than the amount of its cost at the time the investment was purchased. A dividend is a parsing out a share of the profits, and is taxed at the dividend tax rate. If there is an increase of value of stock, and a shareholder chooses to sell the stock, the shareholder will pay a tax on capital gains (often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income). If a holder of the stock chooses to not participate in the <b>buyback,</b> the price of the holder's shares could rise (as well as it could fall), but the tax on these gains is delayed until the sale of the shares.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the main}} criticisms of the <b>buyback</b> {{contracts}} include lack of flexibility of cost recovery and in some cases, the NIOC's limited expertise to reverse field decline rates {{in comparison to the}} International Oil Company (IOC) that developed the field.

NIOC will set up joint ventures for crude oil and gas production with international companies which will be paid with a share of the output. IPCs will be offered for work on somewhere between 34 and 74 oil fields and could last for the duration of a field's life.

[...] In 1988, Steven and Mitchell Rales, of the Cardinal Acquisition Corporation, offered $2.5 billion for the company. [...] In response to the offer, Interco's board authorized $1.95 billion in additional debt to <b>buyback</b> stock. [...] Senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to restructure the company, including a plan to sell 16 of Interco's 20 companies. [...] While this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover, the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years. [...] From 1989 to 1991, Interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions {{in an attempt to}} remain solvent. [...] While the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation, the full value of these assets was never realized by Interco, as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds. [...] The combination of selling the majority of its companies, while being saddled by over $2 billion in debt, created unsustainable negative cash flow, resulting in Inteco's bankruptcy in 1991.

50|$|Writing in the Harvard Business Review in September 2014, William Lazonick blamed record {{corporate}} stock <b>buybacks</b> for reduced {{investment in}} the economy and a corresponding impact on prosperity and income inequality. Between 2003 and 2012, the 449 companies in the S&P 500 used 54% of their earnings ($2.4 trillion) to buy back their own stock. An additional 37% was paid to stockholders as dividends. Together, these were 91% of profits. This left little for investment in productive capabilities or higher income for employees, shifting more income to capital rather than labor. He blamed executive compensation arrangements, which are heavily based on stock options, stock awards and bonuses for meeting earnings per share (EPS) targets (EPS increases as the number of outstanding shares decreases). Restrictions on <b>buybacks</b> were greatly eased in the early 1980s. He advocates changing these incentives to limit <b>buybacks.</b>|$|R

The main prevalent hypothesis amongst scholars and practitioners is that share <b>buybacks</b> can substitute for dividend payouts as a means for companies to return capital to shareholders, possibly with a tax benefit to shareholders. This so-called substitution hypothesis is shown both theoretically and empirically to be a fallacy as share <b>buybacks</b> may significantly affect the value to shareholders. This is important because share <b>buybacks</b> are now substantially larger than dividend payouts in the aggregate, possibly {{as a result of the}} substitution hypothesis commonly believed to be valid. The paper also makes contributions to other areas of finance theory, including a new heuristic for selecting a discount rate for use in valuation, and a new method for estimating the long-term rate of return that can be expected from a stock market index. The theory is also applied to several case studies from the real world. 1 If you find any parts difficult to understand, or if you encounter any errors, be it logical, mathematical, spelling, grammatical or otherwise, please mark the document and e-mail it to: Magnus (at) Hvass-Labs (dot) Org...|$|R

Alternatively, some companies will pay [...] "dividends" [...] from stock rather than in cash; see Corporate action. [...] Financial theory suggests that the dividend policy should be set based upon the type of company and what management determines is the best use of those dividend resources for the firm to its shareholders. [...] As a general rule, shareholders of growth companies would prefer managers to retain earnings and pay no dividends (use excess cash to reinvest into the company's operations), whereas shareholders of value or secondary stocks would prefer the management of these companies to payout surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends when a positive return cannot be earned through the reinvestment of undistributed earnings. [...] A share <b>buyback</b> program may be accepted when the value of the stock is greater than the returns to be realized from the reinvestment of undistributed profits.
