Striking morphological changes are observed in polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunctions upon the substitution of the bridging atom. XRD investigation indicates increased p–p stacking in Si-PCPDTBT compared to the carbon-bridged analogue. The fluorescence of this polymer and that of its counterpart C-PCPDTBT indicates that the higher photogeneration achieved in Si-PCPDTBT:fullerene films (with either [C 60]PCBM or [C 70]PCBM) can be correlated to the inactivation of a charge-transfer complex and to a favorable length of the donor–acceptor phase separation. TEM studies of Si-PCPDTBT:fullerene blended films suggest {{the formation of an}} interpenetrating network whose phase distribution is comparable to the one achieved in C-PCPDTBT:fullerene using 1, 8 -octanedithiol as an additive. In order to achieve a <b>balanced</b> <b>hole</b> and electron transport, Si-PCPDTBT requires a lower fullerene content (between 50 to 60 ¿wt%) than C-PCPDTBT (more than 70 ¿wt%). The Si-PCPDTBT:[C 70]PCBM OBHJ solar cells deliver power conversion efficiencies of over 5 %...|$|R
