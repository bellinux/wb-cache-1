Exports dropped slightly to $7.11 billion, while imports fell 2.1% to $7.20 billion. After being hit hard by El Niño in 1998, fisheries exports have recovered, and minerals and metals exports recorded large gains in 2001 and 2002, mostly {{as a result of}} the opening of the Antamina copper-zinc mine.

Zhou Enlai made a ten-country tour to Africa between December 1963 and January 1964.

In 2007, a fresh joint {{declaration}} was issued during the state visit of the Prime Minister of Vietnam Nguyen Tan Dung. Bilateral trade has increased rapidly since the liberalisation of {{the economies of}} both Vietnam and India. India is the 13th-largest exporter to Vietnam, with exports have grown steadily from US$11.5 million in 1985–86 to USD 395.68 million by 2003. Vietnam's exports to India rose to USD 180 million, including agricultural products, handicrafts, textiles, electronics and other goods. Between 2001 and 2006, the volume of bilateral trade expanded at 20–30% per annum to reach $1 billion by 2006. Continuing the rapid pace of growth, bilateral trade {{is expected to rise}} to $2 billion by 2008, two years ahead of the official target. India and Vietnam have also expanded co-operation in information technology, education and collaboration of the respective national space programmes. Direct air links and lax visa regulations have been established to bolster tourism.|$|E

This paper develops a model in which trading blocs always charge optimal tariffs and make <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> based on strategic considerations. We ask a very simple question. Does the fact that trading blocs can form <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> make Free <b>trade</b> less likely to occur? The answer is that {{it depends on the}} size distribution of the trading blocs. If there is one large trading bloc along with some smaller ones then <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> allow the smaller trading blocs to coalesce and block the monopoly power of large trading blocs. In this case, <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> facilitate the attainment of free trade. Not allowing customs unions leads to more not less protection. If trading blocs are of roughly equivalent size then <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> allow groups of trading blocs to more effectively monopolize world trade in which case they may make free trade less likely.

She then traveled to Afghanistan for the Kabul Conference on the situation there, during which President Hamid Karzai vowed to implement much-promised legal, political, and economic reforms in exchange for a continued Western commitment there. Clinton said that despite the scheduled U.S. drawdown there in 2011, the U.S. has [...] "no intention of abandoning our long-term mission of achieving a stable, secure, peaceful Afghanistan. Too many nations – especially Afghanistan – have suffered too many losses to see this country slide backward." [...] She then went on to Seoul and the Korean Demilitarized Zone where she and Defense Secretary Robert Gates met with South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan and Minister of National Defense Kim Tae-young in a '2+2 meeting' to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Korean War. There she said that the U.S. experience in staying in Korea for decades had led to a successful result, which might also be applicable to Afghanistan. Finally, she went to Hanoi, Vietnam, for the ASEAN Regional Forum, wrapping up what The New York Times termed [...] "a grueling trip that amounted to a tour of American wars, past and present". There she injected the U.S. into the long-running disputes over the sovereignty of the Paracel Islands and Spratly Islands, much to the displeasure of the Chinese who view the South China Sea as part of their core interests, by saying [...] "The United States has a national interest in freedom of navigation, open access to Asia's maritime commons and respect for international law in the South China Sea." ...|$|E

Our probit and multinomial logit estimates show that fund opacity, fund politicization, strategic industry targets, and majority ownership choices lead to a more likely use of vehicles, while <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> negatively affect such investment strategy. We also find that fund opacity increases the likelihood to use SWF-controlled vehicles, while fund politicization, strategic industry targets, and majority ownership choices increase the likelihood to use a corporate vehicle. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> reduce the use of corporate vehicles. Our results also indicate that politicized foreign SWFs are more likely to invest through vehicles located in third countries. On the other hand, when strategic industries are targeted, investment vehicles are likely to be located in the target country. Our results control for SWFs’ strategic goals, SWF experience (reliance on external managers or advisors, fund size), type of funding sources, crisis period, deal-specific effects, and legal and institutional differences across countries and over time...|$|R
