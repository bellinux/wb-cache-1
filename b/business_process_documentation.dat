40|$|<b>Business</b> <b>Process</b> Management (BPM) is a {{systematic}} approach to analyze, optimize, standardize and control <b>business</b> <b>processes.</b> It {{proves to be}} an effective tool in order to attend to growing customer requirements and the need for process performance improvements. Hence, it is the objective of the division of Customer Supply Chain Service (CUS) of the Automotive Aftermarket at Robert Bosch GmbH to implement standardized <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> in all European CUS regional organizations. Combining the findings from literature, group discussions and the results from <b>Business</b> <b>Process</b> Optimization workshops, this thesis aims to collect important data for the creation of value stream maps with Microsoft VISIO. As a result, all AS-IS and TO-BE core <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> of CUS were modelled. Additionally, the TO-BE <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> were integrated and visualized as one <b>Business</b> <b>Process</b> Model framework for all CUS organizations across Europe for the purpose of showing interrelations of the <b>business</b> <b>processes,</b> standardization, <b>documentation</b> and transparency enhancement. Ensuring that the optimized <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> are not only documented, but successfully rolled-out across all European regional organizations of CUS is an immense challenge which many companies in the past have failed to overcome. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to empirically research the critical success factors and challenges for the implementation of redesigned and standardized <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> as well as the organizational changes of CUS. The research method involved half-structured interviews with experts in the field of BPM taking recourse to a literature review. These factors need to be considered and strategically catered to since they have a strong signaling effect for the further success of the change project. Findings of the research reveal a demand for improvement of communication to affected employees and the call for a successive roll-out plan for the implementation as opposed to a radical “Big Bang” change of all <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> across all regional organizations. By applying a gradual step-by-step implementation strategy, “quick wins” in terms of easy-to-implement <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> can be achieved. These instant optimizations lead to employees losing resistance and hesitation towards the change project. Limitation to the research is the application to a single case of one specific organizational unit in the Automotive Aftermarket. ...|$|R

The organizations are therefore encouraged to introduce and maintain an effective management system that will ensure achieving of desired objectives. In the area of continuing airworthiness there is a traditional approach to management represented by developing and maintaining organisation exposition, which is organised in accordance with guidelines provided by regulatory authorities. The expositions are therefore focused mostly on describing duties and responsibilities of organization’s departments instead of identifying processes from their inputs to outputs. We can say that the processes are hidden by organization structure creating barriers between individual departments. The issue described above can be addressed by implementing <b>business</b> <b>process</b> management approach which can be supported by number of software applications enabling the organization to clearly identify and organize its processes, workflow, responsibilities and finally its objectives including regulatory requirements to be met.

The results of a study of Germany’s largest 1, 000 business enterprises (response rate 13. 1 %) reveal that business process analysis, business process improvement and the usage of applicant tracking systems reduce recruiting process costs. Specifically, the cycle time of the recruiting process can be shortened significantly through business process controlling and process analysis, and by using an applicant tracking system that supports the design and evaluation of key performance indicators.

40|$|Much {{research}} has been devoted {{over the years to}} investigating and advancing the techniques and tools used by analysts when they model. As opposed to what academics, software providers and their resellers promote as should be happening, the aim of this research was to determine whether practitioners still embraced conceptual modeling seriously. In addition, what are the most popular techniques and tools used for conceptual modeling? What are the major purposes for which conceptual modeling is used? The study found that the top six most frequently used modeling techniques and methods were ER diagramming, data flow diagramming, systems flowcharting, workflow modeling, UML, and structured charts. Modeling technique use was found to decrease significantly from smaller to medium-sized organizations, but then to increase significantly in larger organizations (proxying for large, complex projects). Technique use was also found to significantly follow an inverted U-shaped curve, contrary to some prior explanations. Additionally, an important contribution of this study was the identification of the factors that uniquely influence the decision of analysts to continue to use modeling, viz., communication (using diagrams) to/from stakeholders, internal knowledge (lack of) of techniques, user expectations management, understanding models 2 ̆ 7 integration into the business, and tool/software deficiencies.

Without such important knowledge, scientists and engineers cannot reproduce, analyse or validate experiments and processes. Previous work has conceived a computer-based representation of a past process for determining provenance, termed <b>process</b> <b>documentation.</b> However, current provenance systems do not adequately address the problem of reliably recording <b>process</b> <b>documentation</b> in large scale environments like Service Oriented Architectures. For example, a service may not be available and network connection may be broken. In this context, reliably recording <b>process</b> <b>documentation</b> becomes challenging, given that the documentation produced in a process can be spread over multiple provenance repositories across the world. The presence of failures (specifically, the crash of provenance repositories and communication failures) may prevent <b>process</b> <b>documentation</b> from being recorded, losing the evidence that a process occurred. This would have disastrous consequences and hence is not acceptable in the domains that rely on <b>process</b> <b>documentation</b> to determine the provenance of their data products. In this thesis, we systematically analyse all situations that may occur during capturing <b>process</b> <b>documentation</b> in the event of assumed failures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this diploma work is to present {{upgrading}} of an operating document system, more precisely introducing credit confirmation into the existent banking document management system. The intention of this system is to enable Banka Volksbank d. d. Ljubljana to use electronic credit confirmation as well as electronic archiving of the related documentation. First, a document system as {{a key part of}} up-to-date business information systems is described. Document systems, which nowadays develop extremely rapidly, enable more than merely secure data saving. Today requirements are much higher, since current document systems upgrade the entire <b>business</b> <b>process</b> of a company, which consequently puts the company ahead of competition and increases its effectiveness. In the past credit confirmation procedure at the bank was not electronically supported, which due to the abundance of documents caused lack of clarity, bad control and hence, slow credit operating of the company. This led to the requirement for creation of a program solution “Credit confirmation in banking document management system,” which is the topic of my diploma work. The existing document system, being already used in the working environment of the company, has been expanded to the process of credit confirmation. The tool Lotus Notes/Domino, suitable for <b>business</b> <b>process</b> and <b>documentation</b> management, has been used. It works on the principle client – server, which enables access to information (documents), its classification and management in the network. The access to documents is very simple and is performed via views or embedded views in the form. By categorized display and access to credit documents from one site, the work of bank clerks has been facilitated, as otherwise the documentation would move from one department to another. The aim of this paper has been achieved: an operating part of a document system that meets all the requirements has been developed.
