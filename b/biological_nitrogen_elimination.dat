40|$|In the {{research}} project a novel concept for a fully autotrophic <b>biological</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>elimination</b> from wastewater highly loaded with ammonium in trickling filters was developed from scratch. In municipal {{wastewater treatment plants}} the problem of nitrogen reloading of the sludge liquor after dewatering, which {{can add up to}} 20 % of the nitrogen load of the influent, is a current topic. Treatment of this split-stream with concentrations of 500 - 2500 mg/l ammounium nitrogen is of high interest, in order to fulfil the effluent limitations according to the supplements of the AbwV of e. g. 18 mg/I N_a_n_o_r_g. With this novel process the process wastewater highly loaded with ammonium after the anaerobic sludge digestion is treated. For this 60 % of the ammonium is oxidized microbially in a trickling filter to nitrite, whereas nitration is suppressed. In the next stage in another trickling filter ammonium is converted autotrophically with nitrite as the electron acceptor under anoxic conditions to nitrogen gas (Anammox-process). The economic advantages of the process are enormous, because only 60 % of the nitrogen-containing substances must be oxidized to nitrite. Thus the oxygen demand is only about one third of that required for the at time usually complete nitrification of nitrate. Especially the autotrophic anoxic ammonium oxidation with nitrite is independent of organic substances, in contrast to heterotrophic denitrification requiring a particular C/N-ratio. The investigations were done with sludge liquor of the wastewater treatment plant from Sindelfingen in a semitechnical scale plant at the 'Teaching and Research Sewage Treatment Plant Buesnau'. The process was realized successfully on this scale. On the basis of this data an appraisal of the costs was made using as model the wastewater treatment plant of Sindelfingen. The results are very promosing in comparison to the costs of other processes. (orig.)

40|$|Dogs with {{isolated}} {{loops of}} small intestine show many evidences of intoxication. A {{study of the}} total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>elimination</b> shows a great rise above the normal base-line minimum of the fasting period (Table II). This means that the intoxication {{is associated with a}} great destruction of body protein, and explains the high non-protein nitrogen of the blood which was observed and reported previously (2). Injection of a proteose obtained from a closed intestinal loop will cause a similar rise in the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>elimination</b> curve. This furnishes more evidence that the intoxication observed in association with a closed intestinal loop is in reality a proteose intoxication. Dogs injected with sublethal doses of proteose will show a definite tolerance to subsequent injection, and will show much less acute intoxication after the isolation of a closed intestinal loop (Table 1). These immune or tolerant dogs show a much less pronounced rise in the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>elimination</b> curve during proteose intoxication of any type. This indicates that the tolerance or immunity to proteose gives more protection for the body proteins against the injury which these toxic proteoses inflict upon the body cells. Complete duodenal obstruction combined with a gastrojejunostomy gives a chronic type of intestinal obstruction associated with little vomiting, which is peculiarly suited to metabolism study (Table IV). Such duodenal obstructions show a definite and sustained rise in the curve of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>elimination</b> above the normal base-line level. These dogs, too, are tolerant to injections of standard toxic proteoses. Control ether anesthesia experiments show little if any rise in the curve of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>elimination</b> (Table VI). Control laparotomy experiments show a definite rise in the curve of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>elimination,</b> but a rise which is small compared with the rise noted in the intoxication of duodenal obstruction or of isolated intestinal loops. It is probable that the tissue injury and disintegration associated with the wound reaction are responsible for the general reaction. We may assume that protein split products from the wound area are absorbed and are responsible for the general reaction observed. We propose to assume that the intoxications here studied are associated with a definite proteose intoxication, which is capable of initiating and continuing a profound injury of tissue protein. One index of this protein injury is the great and sustained rise in the curve of total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>elimination...</b>|$|R

The experiment was performed in 2014 in a completely randomized design arranged in a 5 x 3 factorial scheme, corresponding to 5 rates of Mo (control, 40, 80, 120 and 240 g ha- 1), the common bean cultivars Aporé, Ouro Negro and NORH- 54 (a non-nodulating common bean cultivar), and three replicates. The application of Mo and the inoculation with rhizobia strains contributed to improving nitrogen fixation and grain weight. The cultivar Ouro Negro showed a higher number and weight of nodules and a higher amount of nitrogen derived from the atmosphere than the cultivar Aporé.

The psychrophilic microorganisms exhibit an optimum temperature of less than 25 degreesC. The anaerobic purification takes place as single- or two-step methanization process.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The municipal wastewater purification comprises anaerobic biological purification of the wastewater by using a biomass (15 - 100 g/l) from psychrophilic microorganisms, concentrating the sludge by separating the wastewater and feeding back the sludge into the anaerobic biological purification. The psychrophilic microorganisms exhibit an optimum temperature of less than 25 degreesC. The anaerobic purification takes place as single- or two-step methanization process. The biomass is suspended in the wastewater and is immobilized in a bioreactor (111). The sludge is concentrated through micro filtration by means of rotation disk filters. Phosphorus precipitates and nitrogen are eliminated from the wastewater after the supply into the anaerobic <b>biological</b> purification. The <b>nitrogen</b> <b>elimination</b> takes place via exchange of the ammonium nitrogen at the zeolite. The zeolite loaded with ammonium-nitrogen is regenerated with regeneration solution. The ammonium-nitrogen {{is removed from the}} regeneration solution through air stripping and ammonia is received from the solution. The regeneration solution is again used partly after the air stripping for the regeneration of the zeolite. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) a procedure for the production of biogas from wastewater; and (2) a device for the anaerobic biological purification of wastewater.

40|$|Nitrification is an {{integral}} part of <b>biological</b> <b>nitrogen</b> removal processes and usually the limiting step in wastewater treatment systems. Since nitrification is often considered not feasible at temperatures higher than 40  °C, warm industrial effluents (with operating temperatures higher than 40  °C) need to be cooled down prior to biological treatment, which increases the energy and operating costs of the plants for cooling purposes. This study describes the occurrence of thermophilic <b>biological</b> <b>nitrogen</b> removal activity (nitritation, nitratation, and denitrification) at a temperature as high as 50  °C in an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant treating wastewater from an oil refinery. Using a modified two-step nitrification-two-step denitrification mathematical model extended with the incorporation of double Arrhenius equations, the nitrification (nitrititation and nitratation) and denitrification activities were described including the cease in biomass activity at 55  °C. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed that Nitrosomonas halotolerant and obligatehalophilic and Nitrosomonas oligotropha (known ammonia-oxidizing organisms) and Nitrospira sublineage II (nitrite-oxidizing organism (NOB)) were observed using the FISH probes applied in this study.
