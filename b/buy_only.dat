25|$|Sales of {{fair trade}} {{products}} only really {{took off with}} the arrival of the first Fairtrade certification initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, North America. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to <b>buy</b> <b>only</b> a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels. The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.|$|E

500|$|Hersey {{began by}} making himself {{familiar}} {{with the work of}} writers already in the market who were capable of producing the kind of material Ralston wanted. [...] He soon concluded that the new magazine would have to include some reprinted stories alongside the original material. [...] The budget did not permit Hersey to pay rates that would attract top-quality writers, nor even to reprint the best-known stories of the kind he was looking for, and he was forced to use relatively unknown authors such as Perley Poore Sheehan and Robert W. Sneddon. [...] Hersey distributed a [...] "Notice to Writers" [...] that described what he was looking for: [...] "strange, bizarre, occult, mysterious tales... mystic happenings, weird adventures, feats of leger-de-main, spiritualism, et cetera... If you have an idea which you have considered too bizarre to write, too weird or strange, let us see it." [...] This did not restrict the submissions to fantasy or science fiction, and as a result Hersey received (and printed) all kinds of fiction, including mysteries, adventures, and love stories, though it may be that he simply did not receive enough good quality science fiction and fantasy to fill the magazine. [...] Hersey later recalled that the notice did not bring in many usable manuscripts: [...] "As a result of the notices in the writers' magazines, I received a thousand manuscripts but was able to <b>buy</b> <b>only</b> ten!" ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{was also}} {{famous for the}} [...] "Cass criterion" [...] for {{overlapping}} generations models and in the neoclassical growth model, and his work, together with Karl Shell, {{on the influence of}} extrinsic uncertainty on economic equilibria, also known as the concept of sunspot equilibria or the theory of sunspots. Together with Joseph Stiglitz he proved conditions under which it is possible for an investor to achieve an optimal portfolio under the restriction of being able to <b>buy</b> <b>only</b> two mutual funds. They also showed that generally the demand for money can not be derived from portfolio theory. Cass was also a major contributor to the theory of incomplete markets, the turnpike theory and theory of economies with markets that repeatedly open over time.|$|E

2500|$|Almost {{all species}} kept in marine aquaria {{at this time}} {{are caught in the}} wild, {{although}} tank-raised specimens are becoming increasingly common as a viable alternative. Only a few species such as clownfish are captive-bred on a commercial scale. Much collecting is done in Indonesia and the Philippines, where use of cyanide and other destructive collection methods, while discouraged, is unfortunately common. The majority of live rock is also harvested in the wild, and recent restrictions on this harvest in Florida have caused a shift to Fijian and aquacultured rock. Natural rock, because it is created by coral polyps, takes many years if not centuries to form, and is a vital habitat for countless marine species; thus, commercial-scale harvesting of naturally occurring live rock has been criticized by conservationists. Additionally, many animal species sold to hobbyists have very specific dietary and habitat requirements that cannot be met by hobbyists (e.g. Labroides genus wrasses, the moorish idol); these animals almost inevitably die quickly and have markedly reduced lifespans compared to wild specimens. Often these specific environmental requirements cause improperly housed lifestock's color and appearance to be poor. These issues are often downplayed by individuals and organizations with a financial interest in the trade. Hobbyists who support conservation should <b>buy</b> <b>only</b> certified net-caught fish (although ensuring the legitimacy of such claims can be difficult) or captive-raised fish, as well as farmed corals and to support legitimate reef conservation efforts. The majority of corals can be [...] "fragged", whereby a portion of a larger captive coral is separated and can subsequently be raised into an individual specimen, allowing for coral propagation within the domestic aquarium; the trade in frags (i.e. fragments) offers a fantastic opportunity for marine aquarists to obtain new and unique corals while limiting the impact on the natural environment. Rare species and those without a history of being successfully kept in captivity should be avoided.|$|E

Lastly of putting a spirit of honesty, industry and skill into our shopkeepers, who, if a resolution could now be taken to <b>buy</b> <b>only</b> our native goods, would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing, though often and earnestly invited to it.[136] ...|$|E
