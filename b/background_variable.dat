30|$|The {{present study}} showed that nested {{imputation}} methods are suitable approaches to deal with missing values in both continuous and categorical <b>background</b> <b>variables.</b> Both SMI and MMI yield virtually unbiased estimates of subpopulation differences and regression coefficients for <b>background</b> <b>variables</b> with missing data. Concerning the estimation of standard errors, MMI more accurately reflect the uncertainty due to missing data in the <b>background</b> <b>variables</b> than SMI, resulting in slightly larger standard errors.

40|$|The {{briefing}} {{stage is}} of utmost importance to public private partnership (PPP) projects as it conveys the major message regarding what stakeholders need. However, stakeholders' needs are not often stated clearly at the briefing stage. In considering this, the current paper aimed at analyzing the key stakeholders' needs that should be known by project participants. Eighteen factors related to stakeholders' needs were identified based on literature and interviews. The importance of these factors was rated using a questionnaire survey in Hong Kong. Also, {{it was expected that}} some <b>background</b> <b>variables</b> should be taken into account when rating these factors. Therefore, other than using simple rating methods, a custom-made weighted ranking method was developed, which could enable an estimation of the weighted importance of stakeholder-related factors. In this research, four <b>background</b> <b>variables</b> were identified and their effects on the aspects such as type and nature of a PPP project, role in a PPP project, and experience working in a PPP project were examined. In order to group the factors, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted and four dimensions were extracted.

Greatly inspired by Meijer, Verloop and Beijaard (1999), this study uses a questionnaire and an interview to continue the line of their investigation. The study aims to describe and illustrate the content of 13 teachers’ personal practical knowledge about teaching reading comprehension to non-English majors at a university in China. The study is also to examine similarities (shared knowledge) and differences in teacher knowledge, and potentially relevant <b>background</b> <b>variables</b> in it. As a result, detailed information about these teachers’ personal practical knowledge about teaching reading comprehension has been found. Meijer et al.
