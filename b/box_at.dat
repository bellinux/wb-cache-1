5|$|By 11 February, the Jurong-Kranji Defence Line {{was left}} undefended which allowed the Japanese forces to sweep through the Line to attack Bukit Timah.

5|$|During the pouring rain, a {{young boy}} helps {{his mother and father}} leave a heavily chained toy <b>box</b> <b>at</b> the {{doorstep}} of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends with instructions to not be opened. The next day, Frankie has grown outraged about her job as the house caretaker; Mr. Herriman has been giving her endless chores to take care day after day without thanking her for any of it. When Frankie discovers the box left on the doorstep, Herriman instructs her to leave it in the attic. In a fit of anger toward Herriman, she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it. She falls inside, only to discover it is a vast world filled with anthropomorphic toys and delectable treats. She hears and sympathizes with {{a young boy}}'s voice (Max Burkholder), later revealed to be the imaginary friend named World (given the name by the crew of the show), who has been living alone in the toy chest since his family left the <b>box</b> <b>at</b> Foster's.|$|E

5|$|Abe refines this {{proof-of-concept}} {{and builds}} a stable time-apparatus ("the box"), sized {{to accommodate a}} human subject. Abe uses this box to travel six hours into his own past—as part of this process, Original-Abe sits incommunicado in a hotel room, {{so as not to}} interact or interfere with the outside world, after which Original-Abe enters the box, waits inside the box for six hours (thus going back in time six hours), and becomes Future-Abe, who travels across town, explains the proceedings to Aaron, and brings Aaron back to the self-storage facility housing the <b>box.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the overlap-timespan, Original-Abe enters the box and ceases to exist.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1929 {{on a branch}} from Wembley Park to Stanmore to serve a new housing {{development}} at Canons Park, with stations at Kingsbury and Canons Park (Edgware) (renamed Canons Park in 1933). The government again guaranteed finance, this time under the Development Loans Guarantees & Grants Act, the project also quadrupling the tracks from Wembley Park to Harrow. The line was electrified with automatic colour light signals controlled from a signal <b>box</b> <b>at</b> Wembley Park and opened on 9 December 1932.|$|E
5|$|Houses of the Holy topped charts worldwide, and the band's {{subsequent}} concert tour of North America in 1973 broke {{records for}} attendance, as they consistently filled large auditoriums and stadiums. At Tampa Stadium in Florida, they played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record {{set by the}} Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium concert and grossing $309,000. Three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release of this project (The Song Remains the Same) was delayed until 1976. Before the final night's performance, $180,000 of the band's money from gate receipts {{was stolen from a}} safe deposit <b>box</b> <b>at</b> the Drake Hotel.|$|E

Near {{to the top of the}} ridge, there is a commemorative heritage site marker which shows the area where the Battle of Pasir Panjang of 1942 was fought.|$|E
5|$|Martial's {{mention of}} gift-giving is {{repeated}} in the account by Dio, who says that Titus would throw wooden balls into the crowd from his seat in the <b>box</b> <b>at</b> {{the north end of}} the arena. These balls were inscribed with a description of a gift, either food, clothing, slaves, pack animals, horse, cattle, or gold or silver vessels. Anybody who caught one could hand over the ball to an official who would provide the named gift in return. This was not unusual: Suetonius mentions that Nero did the same, giving 1,000 birds daily, as well as food parcels, and vouchers for various extravagant gifts.|$|E
5|$|Quainton Road {{closed to}} {{passengers}} on 4 March 1963 and to goods on 4 July 1966. On 3 September 1966 the GCR line from Aylesbury to Rugby was abandoned, {{leaving only the}} stretch from Aylesbury to Calvert, running through the now-closed Quainton Road, open for freight trains. This {{was reduced to a}} single track shortly afterwards. The signal <b>box</b> <b>at</b> Quainton Road was abandoned on 13 August 1967, and the points connecting to the goods yard were disconnected.|$|E

5|$|The Kalākaua group {{arrived in}} London {{the evening of}} July 6. The King spent the next day {{receiving}} visitors in his suite at Claridge's, later accepting Queen Victoria's offer of the royal <b>box</b> <b>at</b> the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. While in England, he attended an Eton v Harrow cricket match, {{and returned to the}} Royal Opera House to hear opera singer Adelina Patti. The Queen's annual Windsor Great Park review of 50,000 military volunteers drew many high-ranking and titled spectators, including Kalākaua. Following the review, he was entertained by Civil Lord of the Admiralty Thomas Brassey and his wife at their encampment. He attended worship services at Westminster Abbey on Sunday, prior to his afternoon sailing trip with Lord Charles Beresford and guests.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} signal box overlooking Norwood Road {{and a similar}} signal <b>box</b> <b>at</b> {{the northern end of}} the station were demolished in 1956 and replaced by a single signal box adjacent to the north junction. The replacement signal box was in use from June 1956 until December 1981, when its functions were transferred to Victoria; the building still exists and is used by railway staff. The signalling at Herne Hill was upgraded from semaphores to colour lights on 8 March 1959 as part of the Kent Coast electrification plan.|$|E

Josh flees the country until he is old enough to receive the money his father left aside. Veronica shows Keith the DVD. Keith calls the Sheriff's office and finds that Sheriff Lamb has just died from his wounds. Veronica sees Logan and Parker talking.|$|E

5|$|When Angel {{was first}} opened, a long {{dead-end}} siding was provided for train stabling, converging {{from the left}} onto the northbound line {{just south of the}} station. This was retained over the years but eventually it was closed on 23 January 1959 (along with the signal <b>box</b> <b>at</b> {{the south end of the}} platform) to simplify through running. The siding lay derelict and unused until the rebuilding scheme. Part of the siding was used as the northbound diversion tunnel, which branched off the existing northbound line, cut through into the end of the siding and continued along it until it branched off left to the new northbound platform.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a <b>box</b> <b>at</b> {{the top of the}} inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, {{but there was no sign}} of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
5|$|The first {{performance}} of Falstaff {{took place at}} La Scala on 9 February 1893. For the first night, official ticket prices were thirty times higher than usual. Royalty, aristocracy, critics and leading figures from the arts all over Europe were present. The performance was a huge success; numbers were encored, {{and at the end}} the applause for Verdi and the cast lasted an hour. That was followed by a tumultuous welcome when the composer, his wife and Boito arrived at the Grand Hotel de Milan. Even more hectic scenes ensued when he went to Rome in May for the opera's premiere at the Teatro Costanzi, when crowds of well-wishers at the railway station initially forced Verdi to take refuge in a tool-shed. He witnessed the performance from the Royal <b>Box</b> <b>at</b> the side of King Umberto and the Queen.|$|E
