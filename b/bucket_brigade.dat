25|$|Suffering {{from the}} effects of at least 65 hits, Astoria fought for her life. A <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> battled the blaze on the gun deck and the {{starboard}} passage forward from that deck, and the wounded were moved to the captain's cabin, where doctors and corpsmen proceeded with their care. Eventually, however, the deck beneath grew hot and forced the wounded back to the forecastle. The <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> made steady headway, driving the fire aft on the starboard side of the gun deck, while a gasoline handy-billy rigged over the side pumped a small stream into the wardroom passage below.|$|E

It was rare, however, for anyone to journey the full length of Silk Road. Instead, merchants moved products like a <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade,</b> goods being traded from one middleman to another, moving from China {{all the way to the}} West; the goods moving over such long distances reached extravagant prices.|$|E
25|$|On November 28, 1912, around 10:30pm, a fire, {{probably}} due to faulty electric wiring, {{broke out in the}} attic of the newest administration building, where a Thanksgiving dance was being held. The approximately 80 students on the premises evacuated themselves safely, and then formed a makeshift <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade.</b> The fire departments summoned from nearby Hyattsville and Washington, D.C., arrived too late. Fanned by a strong southwest wind, the fire destroyed the barracks where the students were housed, all the school's records, and most of the academic buildings, leaving only Morrill Hall untouched. The loss was estimated at $250,000 (about $5.8 million in 2012 U.S. dollars) despite no injuries or fatalities. The devastation was so great that many never expected the university to reopen. University President Richard Silvester resigned, brokenhearted.|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates a {{new form}} of public {{participation}} in environmental monitoring and regulation advanced through local “bucket brigades,” which allow community members to sample air emissions near industrial facilities. These brigades represent {{a new form}} of community environmental policing, in which residents participate in collecting, analyzing, and deploying environmental information, and more importantly, in an array of public policy dialogues. Use of this sampling technology has had marked effects on local residents' perceptions and participation in emergency response and citizens' right-to-know. However, when viewed through the lens of the more developed literature on community policing, the <b>bucket</b> <b>brigades</b> are currently limited in their ability to encourage “co-production” of environmental protection between citizens and the state. Means are examined to strengthen the <b>bucket</b> <b>brigades</b> and to more broadly support community participation in environmental regulation.

500|$|Using {{detailed}} {{information provided by}} Loyalist spies, the grenadier companies searched the small town for military supplies. When they arrived at Ephraim Jones's tavern, by the jail on the South Bridge road, they found the door barred shut, and Jones refused them entry. According to reports provided by local Loyalists, Pitcairn knew cannon had been buried on the property. Jones was ordered at gunpoint to show where the guns were buried. These {{turned out to be}} three massive pieces, firing 24-pound shot, that were much too heavy to use defensively, but very effective against fortifications, with sufficient range to bombard the city of Boston from other parts of nearby mainland. The grenadiers smashed the trunnions of these three guns so they could not be mounted. They also burned some gun carriages found in the village meetinghouse, and when the fire spread to the meetinghouse itself, local resident Martha Moulton persuaded the soldiers to help in a <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> to save the building. Nearly a hundred barrels of flour and salted food were thrown into the millpond, as were 550 pounds of musket balls. Of the damage done, only that done to the cannon was significant. All of the shot and much of the food was recovered after the British left. [...] During the search, the regulars were generally scrupulous in their treatment of the locals, including paying for food and drink consumed. [...] This excessive politeness was used to advantage by the locals, who were able to misdirect searches from several smaller caches of militia supplies.|$|E
500|$|Monitor {{was soon}} in trouble {{as the storm}} {{increased}} in ferocity. Large waves were splashing over and completely covering the deck and pilot house so the crew temporarily rigged the wheel atop the turret which was manned by helmsman Francis Butts. Water continued flooding into the vents and ports and the ship began rolling uncontrollably in the high seas. Sometimes she would drop into a wave with such force the entire hull would tremble. Leaks were beginning to appear everywhere. Bankhead ordered the engineers to start the Worthington pumps, which temporarily stemmed the rising waters, but soon Monitor {{was hit by a}} squall and a series of violent waves and water continued to work its way into the vessel. Right when the Worthington pump could no longer keep pace with the flooding a call came from the engine room that water was gaining there. Realizing the ship was in serious trouble, Bankhead signaled Rhode Island for help and hoisted the red lantern next to Monitors white running light atop the turret. He then ordered the anchor dropped to stop the ship's rolling and pitching with little effect making it no easier for the rescue boats to get close enough to receive her crew. He then ordered the towline cut and called for volunteers, Acting Master Stodder, along with crewmates John Stocking, and James Fenwick volunteered and climbed down from the turret, but eyewitnesses said that {{as soon as they were}} on the deck Fenwick and Stocking were quickly swept overboard and drowned. Stodder managed to hang onto the safety lines around the deck and finally cut through the [...] towline with a hatchet. At 11:30p.m. Bankhead ordered the engineers to stop engines and divert all available steam to the large Adams centrifugal steam pump; but with reduced steam output from a boiler being fed wet coal it too was unable to stem the rapidly rising water. After all steam pumps had failed, Bankhead ordered some of the crew to man the hand pumps and organized a <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade,</b> but to no avail.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{has studied}} {{stochastic}} models {{and analysis of}} warehouse operations. After an overview of stochastic research in warehouse operations, we explore the following topics. Firstly, we search optimal batch sizes in a parallel-aisle warehouse with online order arrivals. We employ a sample path optimization and perturbation analysis algorithm to search the optimal batch size for a warehousing service provider, and a central finite difference algorithm to search the optimal batch sizes {{from the perspectives of}} customers and total systems. Secondly, we research a polling-based dynamic order picking system for online retailers. We build models to describe and analyze such systems via stochastic polling theory, find closed-form expressions for the order line waiting times, and apply polling-based picking to online retailers. We then present closed-form analytic expressions for pick rates of order picking <b>bucket</b> <b>brigades</b> systems in different storage profiles, and show how to combine storage policies and <b>bucket</b> <b>brigades</b> protocols to improve order picking productivity. Finally, we propose a new warehouse design approach oriented to improving revenue management of public storage warehouses. Our experiments show a proper facility design can significantly improve the expected revenue of public storage warehouses...|$|R
2500|$|By 1730, Richard Newsham, in London, {{had made}} {{successful}} fire engines; he invented {{the first ones}} used in New York City (in 1731) (this was six years before formation of the NYC volunteer fire department). The amount of manpower and skill necessary for firefighting prompted Benjamin Franklin to found an organized fire company in 1737. Thomas Lote built the first fire engine made in America in 1743. These earliest engines are called hand tubs because they are manually (hand) powered and the water was supplied by a <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> dumping it into a tub (cistern) where the pump had a permanent intake pipe. An important advancement around 1822 was the invention of an engine which could draft water from a water source. This rendered the <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> obsolete. In 1822, a Philadelphia-based manufacturing company called Sellers and Pennock made a model called [...] "The Hydraulion". It {{is said to be}} the first suction engine. Some models had the hard, suction hose fixed to the intake and curled up over the apparatus known as a squirrel tail engine.|$|E
