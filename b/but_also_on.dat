5|$|As {{with most}} small birds, {{mortality}} {{in the first}} year of life is high, but adults aged three to four years are regularly recorded, and the record is more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by stoats, weasels and crows such as the European magpie, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey, particularly the sparrowhawk. Small birds are also at the mercy of the weather, particularly when migrating, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> the breeding and wintering grounds.|$|E

5|$|His {{impact was}} {{not only on the}} world of education, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> Argentine {{political}} and social structure. His ideas are now revered as innovative, though at the time they were not widely accepted. He was a self-made man and believed in sociological and economic growth for Latin America, something that the Argentine people could not recognize at the time with the soaring standard of living which came with high prices, high wages, and an increased national debt.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} can {{be divided}} into thermotropic, lyotropic and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of organic molecules, although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a phase transition into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and concentration of the liquid-crystal molecules in a solvent (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> the inorganic-organic composition ratio.|$|E
5000|$|It occurs {{throughout}} the Himalaya at 500-3000 m of elevation from Pakistan through Nepal and Bhutan to Yunnan in southwest China. It grows best on deep volcanic loamy soils, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> grows <b>on</b> clay, sand and gravel. It tolerates {{a wide variety}} of soil types and grows well in very wet areas. It needs plenty of moisture in the soil and prefers streamside locations, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> grows <b>on</b> slopes.|$|R

5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{microscopic}} exocrine glands in {{the skin}} that secrete an oily or waxy matter, called sebum, to lubricate and waterproof the skin and hair of mammals. In humans, they occur in the greatest number on the face and scalp, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> {{all parts of the}} skin except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The type of secretion of the sebaceous glands is referred to as holocrine.|$|E
5|$|Similarities that lemurs {{share with}} anthropoid primates, such as diet and social organization, {{along with their}} own unique traits, have made lemurs the most heavily studied of all mammal groups on Madagascar. Research often focuses on the link between ecology and social organization, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> their {{behavior}} and morphophysiology (the study of anatomy in relation to function). Studies of their life-history traits, behavior and ecology help understanding of primate evolution, since they are thought to share similarities with ancestral primates.|$|E
5|$|Six {{prototype}} trams {{were delivered}} by Strømmen in 1937, with four different motor solutions, from AEG, Siemens, Vickers and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). None {{of these were}} particularly successful, and the 40 serial production trams used conventional motors from ELIN. These were delivered in 1939, with 20 (class E) being used by Oslo Sporveier mainly on the Kjelsås Line, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> other services. The remaining 20 trams (class B) were leased to Bærumsbanen, that used them on the Kolsås and Østensjø Lines, and later on the Ekeberg Line.|$|E

5|$|The adult Iago sparrow feeds {{mainly on}} the seeds of grass and grain (the main cereal crop grown in Cape Verde is maize), <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> insects and plant shoots. They can do damage to crops by eating young leaves, and like house sparrows will eat the food scraps {{available}} near houses. Nestlings, by contrast to adults, are fed almost exclusively on insects, especially caterpillars, flies, and orthopterans. The Iago sparrow forages mostly on the ground, moving restlessly whilst clinging to the ground like a mouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} common in spruce-fir and spruce-moorland forests and in spruce forests and plantations. Together with spruces, the fungus is also common in {{different}} European beech and oak-European hornbeam forests, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> the forest edges, on clearings and in clearcut meadows and even on juniper heathers and in parkland. There are scarcely any habitats where the spruce is common, while the fungus is not found there. The fungus is very common in young spruce forests that are 10 to 20 years old, where it occurs on forest path edges occasionally in masses.|$|E

5|$|Tires {{have a large}} {{influence}} over bike handling, especially on motorcycles, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> bicycles. Tires influence bike dynamics in two distinct ways: finite crown radius and force generation.

Increasing the crown radius of the rear tire has the opposite effect, but to a lesser degree.|$|E
5|$|With {{the gradual}} {{growth of the}} {{electrification}} of the inner London suburban lines after 1915, the class tended to be used on stopping trains on the LSWR main line, and on services to Guildford and Reading. After {{the formation of the}} Southern Railway in 1923 the class gradually began to be used, further afield, notably in the west of England, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> branch lines in Kent, and on the former South Eastern and Chatham Railway line between Redhill and Reading.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{critics have}} noted the {{similarity}} between Qwak! and the 1984 Nintendo light gun game for the Nintendo Entertainment System titled Duck Hunt. Nintendo used that similarity in a 1986 court case attempting to invalidate a patent held by Sanders Associates; the patent, filed by Ralph Baer, was for the light gun peripheral used in the Magnavox Odyssey light gun game and held to be infringed on by Duck Hunt. Nintendo unsuccessfully claimed that Baer had based his patent {{not only on the}} Odyssey work <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> Qwak! as seen by him at the 1974 MOA show.|$|E

5|$|Betances {{believed}} in the abolition of slavery, inspired not only on written works by Victor Schoelcher, John Brown, Lamartine and Tapia, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> personal experience, {{based on what he}} saw at his father's farm and in daily Puerto Rican life. Based on his beliefs, he founded a civic organization in 1856, one of many others that were later called the Secret Abolitionist Societies by historians. Little is known about them due to their clandestine nature, but Betances and Salvador Brau (a close friend who later became the official Historian of Puerto Rico) describe them in their writings. Some of these societies sought the freedom and free passage of maroons from Puerto Rico to countries where slavery had been abolished already; other societies sought to liberate as many slaves as possible by buying out their freedom.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing {{in a world in which}} slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the American dream.|$|E
5|$|Despite their advances, the Bone Wars {{also had}} a {{negative}} impact {{not only on the}} two scientists <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> their peers and the entire field. The public animosity between Cope and Marsh harmed the reputation of American paleontology in Europe for decades. Furthermore, the reported use of dynamite and sabotage by employees of both men may have destroyed or buried hundreds of potentially critical fossil remains. Joseph Leidy abandoned his more methodical excavations in the West, finding he could not keep up with Cope's and Marsh's reckless searching for bones. Leidy also grew tired of the constant squabbling between the two men, with the result that his withdrawal from the field marginalized his own legacy; after his death, Osborn found not a single mention of the man in either of the rivals' works. In their haste to outdo each other, Cope and Marsh haphazardly assembled the bones of their own discoveries. Their descriptions of new species, based on their reconstructions, led to confusion and misconceptions that lasted for decades after their deaths.|$|E
