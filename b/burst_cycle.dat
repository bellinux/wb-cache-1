40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} the phase response {{properties of the}} Hindmarsh–Rose model of neuronal bursting using burst phase response curves (BPRCs) computed with an infinitesimal perturbation approximation and by direct simulation of synaptic input. The resulting BPRCs have a significantly more complicated structure than the usual Type I and Type II PRCs of spiking neuronal models, and they exhibit highly timing-sensitive changes {{in the number of}} spikes per burst that lead to large magnitude phase responses. We use fast-slow dissection and isochron calculations to analyze the phase response dynamics in both weak and strong perturbation regimes. Our findings include the following: (1) The phase response during the active segment of the burst displays considerable sensitivity (even for very weak perturbations) closely associated with spike times in the perturbed burster. (2) The isochron geometry of the fast subsystem explains the shape and sensitivity of the recorded phase response during the active bursting segment. (3) The onset of the homoclinic bifurcation in the fast subsystem during the <b>burst</b> <b>cycle</b> strongly affects the isochron geometry.

40|$|ABSTRACT External {{recording}} and stimulation techniques {{were used to}} determine which neurons and interactions are essential for production of the periodic burst discharge in the lobster cardiac ganglion. Burst activity can be modulated by brief single shocks applied to the four small cells, but not by similar stimulation of the five large cells, suggesting that normally one or more small cells primarily determine burst rate and duration. Repetitive electrical stimulation of large cells initiates spike activity in small cells, probably via excitatory synaptic and/or electrotonic connections which may normally act to prolong bursts and decrease burst rate. Transection of the ganglion can result in burst activity in small cells in the partial or complete absence of large cell spike activity, but large cells isolated from small cell excitatory synaptic input by transection or by application of dinitrophenol do not burst. Generally, transections which decrease excitatory feedback to small cells are accompanied by an increase in burst rate, but mean spike frequency over an entire <b>burst</b> <b>cycle</b> stabilizes at the original level within 10 - 30 min for various groups of cells whose spike-initiating sites are still intact.

30|$|If the ScanSAR SLCs are burst aligned, it is {{possible}} to make an interferogram from them. Currently, ALOS- 2 provides SLC level 1.1 or higher level products. Two compression methods are available (ALOS- 2 Project Team 2014): a so called “full-aperture mode” or Stripmap equivalent range-Doppler algorithm (Bamler and Eineder 1996) and spectral analysis (SPECAN)-based method (Lanari et al. 1998; Sack et al. 1985). The detail of the SAR-focusing algorithms are described by Cumming and Wong (2005). In both case, a level 1.1 ScanSAR product is divided into 5 and 7 sub-swath SLCs for 350 and 490 km total swath, respectively. Each sub-swath has its own pulse repetition frequency (PRF) from 2270 to 3314 Hz. The <b>burst</b> <b>cycle</b> and its duration are 0.79 and 0.158 s for all sub-swaths, respectively. In this subsection, the word “SLC” is used in the sub-swath scale and not the total ScanSAR image because an ALOS- 2 level 1.1 product contains multiple SLCs corresponding to each sub-swaths. If the SLCs are created in full-aperture mode, an accurate co-registration is necessary, as for Stripmap interferometry. However, the ALOS- 2 standard ScanSAR SLC has multiple peaks cyclically in azimuth direction for its autocorrelation function (ACF) due to the padding zeros in the azimuth compression (Bamler and Eineder 1996; Holzner and Bamler 2002). That is, a cross-correlation function between two SLC images, namely “master” and “slave,” has discrete cross-correlation peaks {{in different parts of the}} image. This phenomenon worsens the co-registration accuracy.|$|E

BackgroundWe hypothesized that frequency domain analysis of a filtered wide bipolar atrial electrogram describes the global organization of atrial fibrillation (AF) and should vary over time. Timing burst pacing to periods of high organization of AF should promote regional atrial conduction block and terminate AF. MethodsNine dogs were conditioned with rapid atrial pacing for 48 h. Electrogram recordings were made from a wide right atrium (RA) to left atrium (LA) bipole and digitally filtered. A fast-Fourier transform was performed every 0. 5 s on a sliding 2 -s window, and the organization index (OI) was calculated as a ratio of the area of the first four harmonic peaks to the total power of the spectrum. Organization indexes > 0. 5 indicated more organized AF activity.

40|$|The {{crustacean}} cardiac ganglion {{has traditionally}} been viewed as a two-layered system in which pacemaking {{is a function of}} the four small cells which trigger the five follower motor neurones via chemical and electrotonic synaptic excitation. The work reported here shows that there is strong feedback from motor neurones to small cells, by which endogenous burst-organizing potentials (driver potentials or DPs) and their hyperpolarizing afterpotentials contribute to regulation of bursting frequency. Isolated cardiac ganglia were placed in a two-chamber perfusion system which allowed independent treatment of small cells and motor neurones. When the motor neurones were silenced with tetrodotoxin (TTX), the small cells continued organizing bursts of activity which recurred at an average frequency 41 % higher than bursting by normal ganglia in saline. The average burst duration was not altered. Driver potentials were evoked in TTX-treated motor neurones by electrical stimulation, by ionic alteration of the medium, or by treatment with the cardioexcitor peptide proctolin. DPs which occurred synchron-ously with small-cell bursts prolonged and intensified the bursts (more spikes per burst). When DPs were evoked in motor neurones during the interburst interval, they triggered small-cell bursts even at very short intervals after a spontaneous burst had occurred. All small-cell bursts which were associated with motor neurone DPs were followed by interburst intervals of longer than normal duration. The decrease in instantaneous burst frequency (increase in total <b>burst</b> <b>cycle</b> duration) caused by motor neurone DPs wai similar in magnitude to the drop in burst frequency observed when the ganglion recovered normal activity after TTX washout...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{sediment}} transport in open-channel {{as well as in}} river flow is of great importance for fluvial hydraulics. While the transport of sedimentary particles at the bed, as the bed-load, {{has been the subject of}} much research, less attention has been paid to the transport of sediments in suspension. This thesis is a contribution to our knowledge of the transport of sediments in suspension. The most important theory on the vertical distribution of the mean sediment concentration in suspension flows is the diffusion-convection theory, given by the Rouse equation. This equation is rather simple and contains few parameters. About one of these parameters, the β-value, there is little known, despite its importance and physical meaning. One of the main aims of this thesis is to experimentally measure the β-values for different suspension flow configurations. The major objective was to investigate suspension flows over moveable beds without bed forms and this in capacity condition. Since flows are at times not in capacity, i. e. the flows are not saturated with sediments, an additional study (see Appendix C) was also performed. Furthermore, two special runs were done (see Appendix D), where the bed was covered with artificial bed forms. In order to evaluate the β-values, the vertical profiles of the mean velocity and its fluctuations as well as the mean concentration and its fluctuations had to be measured. This could only be done by using the new ultrasonic instrument (Acoustic Particle Flux Profiler, APFP), developed and assembled at the Laboratoire de Recherches Hydrauliques (LRH). Suspension flows were investigated focusing on the possible modification of the clear-water turbulence by suspended sediments. The concentration was carefully measured and interpreted by the Rouse equation. In particular, the ratio of the sediment, εs(y), and momentum, εm(y), diffusion coefficients, being the β(y) -value, was for the first time, directly measured. The strongest effect of particles on the flow was noticed on the vertical component of the turbulence intensity,, which was considerably suppressed, when compared to clear-water flow. The longitudinal velocity, u(y), its turbulence intensity component,, and the Reynolds stress, – ρu'v', were only slightly affected. By using the APFP instrument, the instantaneous sediment concentrations, cs, were, for the first time, directly measured. The calibration of the APFP instrument was achieved by measuring the mean concentration profiles, cs, with the suction method. The largest measured fluctuating concentrations,, and sediment flux, profiles were observed close to the bed, where the mean concentration is also very large. The sediment, εs, and the momentum, εm, diffusion coefficients, which represent the "ability" of sediment and fluid particles to be diffused in the flow by turbulence, were computed from the APFP measurements. For suspension flows over plane-bed, the sediment diffusion-coefficient profiles are always smaller than the momentum ones, εs εm, leading to β > 1. The most important result of this thesis is a recommendation that the Rouse equation with an improved β-value – itself to be estimated from the experimental plots obtained in this study – can be used to establish the dimensionless concentration profile of suspension flows. For beds without bed forms the β-values are β 1. The correlation between the velocity fluctuations, associated with coherent structures (<b>burst</b> <b>cycle),</b> and the concentration was also investigated. From this study it becomes evident that the ejection event, being the most important phase of a <b>burst</b> <b>cycle,</b> is responsible of the erosion of sediment on the bed, behaving as an "injector" of sediments into the main flow...|$|E

After studying the linear stability of the model, its behavior when an external forcing is added, both deterministic and stochastic, is analyzed.
