5|$|Hybrids are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids <b>between</b> <b>different</b> subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids <b>between</b> <b>different</b> species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids <b>between</b> <b>different</b> genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E

Metamorphlings are divided in roughly equal numbers between males and females, while juvenile frogs are observed less often than their mature counterparts, although scientists are not sure whether this is due to lower abundance or increased reclusiveness.|$|E
