5|$|The <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> {{whitewater}} boating on Loyalsock Creek at Worlds End State Park is from March to May, and {{the park}} hosts a slalom race on Loyalsock Creek each spring. The whitewater gradient is 41 for {{the section of the}} creek in and near the park, and its rating on the International Scale of River Difficulty is II to III+, with sections reaching IV. The water is too swift for open canoes, so visitors are asked to use kayaks. The swimming area is closed to whitewater boating during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|Adam Williams (James Nesbitt) {{breaks up}} with another {{in a long line}} of girlfriends and spends the evening at the pub with his friend Pete Gifford (John Thomson). Pete arrives home late, which annoys his wife Jenny (Fay Ripley), who {{calculated}} that night to be the <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> them to conceive a child. She becomes even more frustrated when she sees Pete has brought Adam back; he missed his last bus home. Rachel Bradley's (Helen Baxendale) boyfriend Simon Atkinson (Stephen Mapes) breaks up with her over dinner after taking a job in Hong Kong. Rachel angrily leaves the restaurant and telephones her friend Karen Marsden (Hermione Norris), who has just asked her husband David (Robert Bathurst) if they can get a nanny to take care of their son Josh.|$|E
5|$|The birds breed {{easily in}} captivity and can lay eggs every 3 weeks between February and November. Once the female has one egg in her nest, {{she will not}} lay another. An egg takes about 30 days to hatch. The eyes of the young open around 3 weeks and the yellow down will show black pin {{feathers}} at about 6 weeks. The <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> hand raising is at about 10 weeks when their black feathers are in place but the tail feathers are still short. Young birds fledge after about 4 months and both sexes have the colouring of their mother. Mature male birds will become aggressive to young male birds at puberty (4 years); they must be separated if caged.|$|E
50|$|Temperature {{varies from}} {{moderate}} to quite cool. The <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> travelling there are from September to December.|$|R
50|$|His {{personal}} <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> the 10K run (27:20 minutes) and the 15K run (42:39 minutes) are {{the fastest}} by any European runner, {{but they have}} not been ratified as European records.|$|R
50|$|Both the {{marathon}} and the half marathon attract elite level competitors. The marathon course records {{are held by}} David Kemboi (2:07:53 hours) and Alla Zhilyaeva (2:27:38 hours). The <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> the half marathon are by Dieudonné Disi (1:01:13) and Christelle Daunay (1:08:34).|$|R
5|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament adds new modes: Leagues, Time Trials, Single Race, and Tournaments. In League mode, players {{compete for}} points in divisions. Seasons consist of four races. Players {{with the most}} points {{at the end of}} the season are {{promoted}} to the next division, and players with the least are relegated. Time Trial mode is where players race alone (although some tracks have a Shadow Racer representing the <b>best</b> <b>time)</b> <b>for</b> the best time, or to practise driving. Single Race is where players compete in a series of rounds in which vehicles begin at the centre of the scree, and get further apart as the race progresses. If a vehicle goes off the screen, they are out of the race unless they have travelled the furthest. The game ends when only one player remains. Tournaments are a fixed race series played in the same manner as Single Races. The winner is the first player to win a set number of times. There are two multiplayer-only modes: Knockout and Share Games. Knockout involves a series of races similar to tournament mode, with winners progressing to the next round and losers knocked out. Share Games is similar to Single Race, but cars are coloured according to team, with each team's finishing position depending on which member performs the best. The Mega Drive J-Cart provides two controller ports, enabling up to eight players in multiplayer by two players sharing the controllers. The Game Gear version retains the console sharing (two player sharing one console) function of the original, and two units can be linked.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} is {{open all}} year from 6am to 5pm. The best weather at the sanctuary is during November and December when {{the area is}} cooled by the Northeast monsoon and the grasslands are the most luxuriant. The <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> bird watching is from October to January and the <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> animal viewing is from March to August.|$|E
25|$|The <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> {{visiting the}} city is in late spring — late April and May, and early in autumn: September, October, when the city's trees turn yellow. Other times are mainly dry with a few showers.|$|E
50|$|The International Association of Athletics Federations {{does not}} {{recognise}} world records over the 5 km road distance. Other statistical organisations, including the Association of Road Racing Statisticians, record <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> the event. Records for the 5K are often noted in national records in athletics.|$|R
5|$|Neither {{of the two}} athletes progressed {{beyond the}} heats, both of whom {{finishing}} last in their heats, therefore meaning that Vanuatu won no medals in this Summer Olympics. Despite this, Kamut and Marae both achieved seasonal <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> their events, the 400 meters and the 100 meters respectively.|$|R
50|$|The Steamboat Classic is {{a running}} race {{featuring}} 4 mile and 15K events in Peoria, Illinois. In 2007 the race drew over 4000 participants. The four-mile race {{has been described}} as the world’s fastest. The world <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> both men and women, have been set at the Steamboat Classic.|$|R
25|$|Horiuchi was {{a runner}} {{in his early}} teens, his <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the 100-meter dash reputedly tying the Olympic record. He was {{nominated}} for Japan's Olympic team, but had to stop running due to an enlarged heart.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Radcliffe {{made the}} {{move up to}} the marathon, a {{decision}} that immediately paid off with victory at her debut in that year's London Marathon on 14 April 2002 in a world's <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a women's only race (2:18:55). Her time was the second quickest in women's marathon history behind the world record of 2:18:47 set by Catherine Ndereba, of Kenya, in Chicago.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} {{towards the}} net/node addressing scheme was also useful for reducing communications costs between continents, where timezone differences on {{either end of}} the connection might also come into play. For instance, the best time to forward mail in the US was at night, but that might not be the <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> European hosts to exchange. Efforts towards introducing a continental level to the addressing system started in 1986.|$|E
50|$|Common {{sightings}} {{include the}} black, spicebush, tiger, zebra and pipevine swallowtails; the gorgone and pearl crescents; red admiral; buckeye; cloudless sulphur; spring azure; variegated and gulf fritillaries; zebra longwing; hackberry; queen; viceroy; and red spotted purple. Late fall to early summer are the <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> sightings, but some remain year round.|$|R
50|$|Public {{holidays}} and weekends {{during the summer}} months were the <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> the Sumner line when the residents of Christchurch sought respite from city life with a day out at the seaside town of Sumner. Almost all services on the Sumner line were steam-hauled though occasionally horses were used for special services.|$|R
50|$|One source {{reports that}} Quartz Mountain {{climbing}} is very strenuous {{and that this}} mountain is not recommended for beginners. It {{has been compared to}} climbing at Joshua Tree National Park. Most of the climbing is done on the south face of the mountain, so summer is not a recommended <b>time</b> <b>for</b> climbing. Spring and fall are the <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> this activity.|$|R
25|$|Wei won the 2002 Beijing Marathon in {{a record}} time, but was disqualified after failing a drugs test and was {{banned from the}} sport for two years. Her {{personal}} <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the marathon is 2:23:12 hours, while her 10km road best of 31:49 minutes is a Chinese record. She represented China at the 2002 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships and the 2007 World Championships in Athletics. She has won medals at the 2001 East Asian Games and the 2011 Military World Games.|$|E
25|$|The <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the 100m set during Olympic {{competition}} {{is known as}} the Olympic record. To count as an official record, the race and the equipment used must adhere to IAAF international rules. Hand-timed results were the standard until 1975, when fully automatic timing (FAT) became the preferred method for officially measuring athletes' times. Further to this wind conditions must be measured and any time achieved with a wind speed of over 2.0 metres per second in a direction behind the athlete is treated as wind-assisted and cannot be taken for an Olympic record mark.|$|E
25|$|When {{the bell}} rang, Seabiscuit broke in front, led by over a length after 20 seconds, and soon crossed {{over to the}} rail position. Halfway down the backstretch, War Admiral started to cut into the lead, {{gradually}} pulling level with Seabiscuit, then slightly ahead. Following advice he had received from Pollard, Woolf had eased up on Seabiscuit, allowing his horse to see his rival, then asked for more effort. Two {{hundred yards from the}} wire, Seabiscuit pulled away again and continued to extend his lead over the closing stretch, finally winning by four lengths despite War Admiral's running his <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the distance.|$|E
5|$|The 4 × 100 m relay team—consisting of Antoine Adams, Allistar Clarke, Kim Collins, and Jason Rogers—qualified {{with a time}} of 38.76. The {{qualification}} <b>times</b> <b>for</b> relay <b>times</b> are {{an average}} of the two <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> the team. In the 4 × 100 meter relay, Saint Kitts and Nevis finished with the slowest time in either heat, placing ahead of the Dominican Republic.|$|R
50|$|The <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> {{trekking}} are {{in spring}} (March and April) and autumn (October and November), when {{the visibility of}} the mountain is ideal and the temperature is not excessively cold.However, in autumn the competition for bed spaces in the lodges can be intense, though normally trekkers are allowed {{to sleep on the}} floor of the dining room lodge.|$|R
50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to light up all of the Glowbos at the same time with their {{respective}} color. The game consists of five different game modes including Puzzle, Time, Hyper, Infinite, and Tutorial. The Puzzle game mode has 15 levels of 8 stages each totaling 120 puzzles altogether. There is also a scoreboard that keeps track of your <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> each puzzle.|$|R
25|$|Port Phillip lies in {{southern}} Victoria, separated from Bass Strait by the Bellarine Peninsula {{to the southwest}} and Mornington Peninsula to the southeast. It is the largest bay in Victoria {{and one of the}} largest inland bays in Australia. The narrow entrance to the bay, called the Rip, between Point Lonsdale and Point Nepean, features strong tidal streams made turbulent by the uneven contours of the seabed. The <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> small craft to enter the Rip is at slack water. Large ships require expert local guidance to enter and exit, provided by the Port Phillip Sea Pilots. Work has commenced to deepen the channel entrance, to allow newer, larger container ships to access Melbourne's docks.|$|E
25|$|He {{ordered the}} {{building}} of the New Town (Nové Město) adjacent to the Old Town and laid out the design himself. The Charles Bridge, replacing the Judith Bridge destroyed in the flood just prior to his reign, was erected to connect the east bank districts to the Malá Strana and castle area. On 9 July 1357 at 5:31am, Charles IV personally laid the first foundation stone for the Charles Bridge. The exact time of laying the first foundation stone is known because the palindromic number 135797531 was carved into the Old Town bridge tower having been chosen by the royal astrologists and numerologists as the <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> starting the bridge construction. In 1347, he founded Charles University, which remains the oldest university in Central Europe.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about his}} pass on Räikkönen {{in the closing}} laps, Massa said that [...] "it was the <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> me in the race, I was quite strong and then I caught him and I passed him." [...] Since the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, where Barrichello ceded the lead to Michael Schumacher, team orders have been banned in Formula One. Räikkönen {{appeared}} unbothered when asked about Massa's pass: [...] "I mean {{we know what we}} want as a team and that's what we did it. It is normal in these situations." [...] No investigation was undertaken by the stewards at the race. GrandPrix.com played down the incident, saying [...] "Anyone who understands racing understood {{what was going on and}} only the silly people objected." ...|$|E
50|$|The 1990s {{were not}} the <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> the Russian cinema in general {{and most of the}} {{released}} movies were mediocre and low-grade. During this period, many actors were forced to star in low-quality films just to make ends meet, and Leonid Kuravlyov was not an exception. Perhaps, his role in a movie called Baryshnya-krestyanka (Lady Into Lassie, 1995) is the only one worth mentioning.|$|R

500|$|Cooper's meticulous {{planning}} {{may also}} have extended to the timing of his operation, and even his choice of attire, according to Kaye's research team. [...] "The FBI searched but couldn't find anyone who disappeared that weekend," [...] Kaye wrote, suggesting that the perpetrator may have returned to his normal occupation. [...] "If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', then you would need {{as much time as}} possible {{to get out of the}} woods, find transportation and get home. The very <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime." [...] Furthermore, [...] "if he was planning ahead, he knew he had to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans." ...|$|E
500|$|The country's sole {{female athlete}} at the 2016 Games was Phumlile Ndzinisa, in the 100 metres. Previously at the 2012 Games, she had {{competed in the}} fourth heat, {{finishing}} in fifth position. She also qualified for the 2016 Games using a wildcard spot, since her personal <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the 100 metres of 11.35 seconds was 0.03 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard. At the 2016 Games, Ndzinisa competed on 12 August in the second heat, finishing fifth, {{with a time of}} 12.49 seconds. She was ahead of Taina Halasima of Tonga (12.8 seconds), Laenly Phoutthavong of Laos (12.82 seconds) and Lerissa Henry of Micronesia (13.53 seconds), but was 0.4 seconds behind Sunayna Wahi of Suriname, who won the heat. Since she failed to finish in the first two places, Ndzinisa's Olympics finished with that single run.|$|E
500|$|Competing at {{her first}} Summer Olympics, Saruba Colley {{qualified}} for the London Games as a wildcard, as her <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the 100 metres event, 12.37 seconds, set in the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, was nearly one second slower than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard. She competed in the preliminary round on 3 August and was drawn in the fourth heat. Colley finished second {{with a time of}} 12.21 seconds, behind heat winner Toea Wisil from Papua New Guinea (11.60 seconds). The result ensured she advanced into the quarter-finals of the event. Colley was placed in heat three along with seven other athletes. She posted a time of 12.06 seconds, finishing eighth and setting a national record in the process. Colley ranked behind Colombian athlete Yomara Hinestroza (11.56 seconds) in a heat led by eventual bronze medallist Veronica Campbell-Brown of Jamaica (10.94 seconds) and Bulgaria's Ivet Lalova (11.06 seconds). She finished 55th out of 56 athletes overall and did not advance to the later rounds.|$|E
2500|$|As {{family members}} were {{generally}} together {{in the morning and}} evening, these would be the <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> them to take part together in religious exercises.

50|$|Leading {{into the}} 2000 Sydney Olympics, Manou enjoyed her best form, setting new {{personal}} <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> 400 and 800 metres in qualifying for the Australian team. At the Games, she was unlucky to {{miss out on}} making the Olympic final in the 800 metres, failing by less than one tenth of a second, but ran in Australia's 4 x 400 metres relay team which set two national records.|$|R
50|$|Keitany {{began the}} year in record-breaking form as she won the Ras Al Khaimah Half Marathon with a world record time of 1:05:50 hours.
