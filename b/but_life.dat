5|$|Madhavan {{is one of}} the few {{actors in}} India who garners pan-Indian appeal, with his success in {{establishing}} himself in the North and the South Indian film industries, seeing him receive multiple offers as a brand ambassador. Furthermore, it has led to producers offering him lead roles in bilingual films such as the English-Malayalam crossover film Nothing <b>But</b> <b>Life</b> and the Hindi-Tamil projects, Yavarum Nalam and Irudhi Suttru. Moreover, most of his Tamil films are dubbed into Telugu, where he has created a box office market without appearing in a single straight Telugu film as a lead actor. Madhavan holds a significant female fan following, which developed after his romantic roles in Alaipayuthey and Minnale. Madhavan has also been active in keeping in contact with fans, maintaining a fan email account, a Facebook fan page and a Twitter account as well as being one of the first actors of Tamil films to turn blogger with entries in the year 2000.|$|E

25|$|One {{in three}} convicts transported after 1798 was Irish, {{about a fifth}} of whom were transported in {{connection}} with the political and agrarian disturbances common in Ireland at the time. While the settlers were reasonably well-equipped, little consideration had been given to the skills required to make the colony self-supporting – few of the first wave convicts had farming or trade experience (nor the soldiers), and the lack of understanding of Australia's seasonal patterns saw initial attempts at farming fail, leaving only what animals and birds the soldiers were able to shoot. The colony nearly starved, and Phillip was forced to send a ship to Batavia (Jakarta) for supplies.

500|$|Gould {{favored the}} {{argument}} that evolution has no inherent drive towards long-term [...] "progress". Uncritical commentaries often portray evolution as a ladder of progress, leading towards bigger, faster, and smarter organisms, the assumption being that evolution is somehow driving organisms to get more complex and ultimately more like humankind. Gould argued that evolution's drive was not towards complexity, but towards diversification. Because life is constrained {{to begin with a}} simple starting point (like bacteria), any diversity resulting from this start, by random walk, will have a skewed distribution and therefore be perceived to move in the direction of higher complexity. <b>But</b> <b>life,</b> Gould argued, can also easily adapt towards simplification, {{as is often the case}} with parasites.|$|E

In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, <b>but</b> <b>life</b> itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now is only spoons... or the last thing you need right now is a knife." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the singer}} has never {{mentioned}} physical abuse in her family, she had mentioned {{that her father}} was a disciplinarian and her stepmother was hard on her. Author Lucy O'Brien wrote in her book Madonna: Like an Icon that the song stemmed more from the emotional neglect that Madonna faced, with her father locked up in grief after Mrs. Ciccone died. When he married again, his new wife was wrapped up with her own children, so the older kids were often left to their own devices. O'Brien believed that for this reason, Madonna's girlhood would have been without much joy, and that [...] "Oh Father" [...] was a potent example of the singer using her imagination to escape from her troubled childhood, while blaming it on her father. Tony later said, [...] "Maybe I'm not the greatest father in the world, <b>but</b> <b>life</b> wasn't easy for us, and Nonni [...] knows all of this." ...|$|E
500|$|In situ {{investigations}} {{have been performed}} on Mars by the Viking landers, Spirit and Opportunity rovers, Phoenix lander, and Curiosity rover. Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown. The Viking probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results, including a temporary increase of CO2 production on exposure to water and nutrients. This sign of life was later disputed by scientists, resulting in a continuing debate, with NASA scientist Gilbert Levin asserting that Viking may have found life. A re-analysis of the Viking data, in light of modern knowledge of extremophile forms of life, {{has suggested that the}} Viking tests were not sophisticated enough to detect these forms of life. The tests could even have killed a (hypothetical) life form. Tests conducted by the Phoenix Mars lander have shown that the soil has a alkaline pH and it contains magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride. The soil nutrients may be able to support life, <b>but</b> <b>life</b> would still have to be shielded from the intense ultraviolet light. A recent analysis of martian meteorite EETA79001 found 0.6 ppm , 1.4 ppm , and 16 ppm , most likely of Martian origin.

500|$|After Bizet's death, {{many of his}} manuscripts were lost; {{works were}} revised by other hands and {{published}} in these unauthorised versions {{so that it is}} often difficult to establish what is authentic Bizet. Even Carmen was altered into grand opera format by the replacement of its dialogue with recitatives written by Guiraud, and by other amendments to the score. The music world did not immediately acknowledge Bizet as a master and, apart from Carmen and the L'Arlésienne suite, few of his works were performed in the years immediately following his death. However, the 20th century saw an increase of interest. Don Procopio was revived in Monte Carlo in 1906; an Italian version of Les pêcheurs de perles was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 13 November 1916, with Caruso in the leading tenor role, and it has since become a staple at many opera houses. After its first performance in Switzerland in 1935, the Symphony in C entered the concert repertory and has been recorded by, among many others, Sir Thomas Beecham. Excerpts from La coupe du roi de Thulé, edited by Winton Dean, were broadcast by the BBC on 12 July 1955, and Le docteur Miracle was revived in London on 8 December 1957 by the Park Lane Group. [...] Vasco da Gama and Ivan IV have been recorded, as have numerous songs and the complete piano music. Carmen, after its lukewarm initial Paris run of 45 performances, became a worldwide popular success after performances in Vienna (1875) and London (1878). It has been hailed as the first opera of the verismo school, in which sordid and brutal subjects are emphasised, with art reflecting life—"not idealised life <b>but</b> <b>life</b> as actually lived".|$|E
500|$|Madhavan {{played an}} imposter gangster in K. S. Ravikumar's comedy Aethiree (2004) before being {{selected}} to feature {{in his fourth}} Mani Ratnam production, Aaytha Ezhuthu (2004), which featured him in an ensemble cast including Suriya, Siddharth, Meera Jasmine, Esha Deol and Trisha. Madhavan portrayed the character of Inba Sekhar, a hitman living in the slums of Chennai, whose path crosses with the characters portrayed by Suriya and Siddharth. His role also featured him in a struggling marriage, where his wife desperately tries to claw him away from his profession. Madhavan bulked up and sported a shaven look {{for the first time}} in his career to resemble the character of a ruffian and shot for the film through the sync sound technique. He received widespread praise for his depiction, with Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu claiming that Madhavan outplayed Abhishek Bachchan's interpretation of the character in the Hindi version of the bilingual, Yuva. Madhavan went on to win the Filmfare Award for the Best Tamil Supporting Actor, whilst another critic from The Hindu cited that he [...] "sparkles as an anti-hero" [...] and that the [...] "character ought to find a very special place in his repertoire". Similarly, a critic from Indiaglitz.com stated [...] "Madhavan's daring decision to play a negative character, who gets beaten up black and blue at the end, putting his 'hero' image in peril, has paid off, as he walks away with top honours", while a reviewer from Sify.com labelled him as [...] "terrific". In late 2004, Madhavan worked on Rajiv Anchal's English-Malayalam crossover film Nothing <b>But</b> <b>Life</b> (2005) and completed his work in a single schedule across Las Vegas and Albuquerque. Portraying an orphaned youth with suicidal tendencies being treated by a Malayali psychiatrist in the USA, the film and his portrayal opened to mixed reviews. He then appeared in another marriage drama film, Priyasakhi (2005) co-starring Sadha – with the pair playing an estranged husband and wife. The film received praise for the lead pair's performances with Madhavan being praised as [...] "top class", while it also became the first Tamil film to be dubbed into Zulu.|$|E
