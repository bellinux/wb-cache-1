40|$|A {{main cause}} of the crisis of 2007 - 2009 is the various ways through which <b>banks</b> have <b>transferred</b> <b>credit</b> risk in the {{financial}} system. We study the systematic risk of banks before the crisis, using two samples of <b>banks</b> respectively trading <b>Credit</b> Default Swaps (CDS) and issuing Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs). After their first usage of either risk transfer method, the share price beta of these banks increases significantly. This suggests the market anticipated the risks arising from these methods, long before the crisis. We additionally separate this beta effect into a volatility and a market correlation component. Quite strikingly, this decomposition shows {{that the increase in}} the beta is solely due to an increase in banks' correlations. Thus, while banks may have shed their individual credit risk, they actually posed greater systemic risk. This creates a challenge for financial regulation, which has typically focused on individual institutions. Securitization Credit derivatives Systemic risk Subprime crisis...|$|R

With the withdrawal of the state, however, participants became exposed to credit, liquidity, and operational risks. In the transition, the central bank has a key role to play in payments systems.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} <b>credit</b> risk <b>transfer</b> (CRT) {{in an economy}} with {{endogenous}} financing (by both banks and non-bank institutions). Our analysis suggests that the incentive of <b>banks</b> to <b>transfer</b> <b>credit</b> risk is aligned with the regulatory objective of improving stability, and so the recent development of credit derivative instruments is to be welcomed. Moreover, we find the <b>transfer</b> of <b>credit</b> risk from <b>banks</b> to non-banks to be more beneficial than CRT within the banking sector. Intuitively, this is because it allows for the shedding of aggregate risk which must otherwise remain within the relatively more fragile banking sector. Therefore, regulators should act to maximize the benefits from CRT by encouraging the development of instruments favorable to the cross-sectoral <b>transfer</b> of aggregate <b>credit</b> risk (including basket credit derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations). Finally, we derive the optimal regulatory stance for banks relative to nonbank financial institutions. We show that {{a level playing field}} approach is sub-optimal. Regulatory stances should be set to actively encourage cross-sector CRT, first because of the higher fragility of the banking sector and second to induce banks to incur the costs of CRT which otherwise lead them to undertake an insufficient amount of CRT...|$|R

The main {{question is whether the}} credit channel matters in transmitting impulses to the real economy in the Philippines. The evidence on the <b>bank</b> <b>credit</b> channel is obtained by estimating changes in <b>bank</b> <b>credit</b> that take into account not only the monetary policy indicators, but specific banking indicators to monetary policy actions, such as bank capital.
