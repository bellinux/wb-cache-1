50|$|The Baltimore Mine Tunnel Disaster {{occurred}} on June 5, 1919 {{just inside the}} mouth of Tunnel No. 2. The mine was located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania just {{about a mile from}} the center of the city. Ninety-two miners were killed in the explosion, which was caused by the ignition of <b>black</b> <b>blasting</b> <b>powder,</b> while another 44 were injured. Only 7 miners escaped without injury.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 14,900 {{cubic yards}} of bedrock was removed using <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> <b>blasting.</b> This was done by {{drilling}} three-foot-long holes and packing them with powder. Drilling one typical hole took up to three hours of hard effort using a three-man crew. Nine to ten holes, each one-inch in diameter and thirty-six inches in length, were made before blasting. One pound of explosive powder wrapped in paper was pushed into each hole, tamped down, punctured with a sharp needle, and a fuse added. Fuses were lit with explosions to occur at mealtime. Workers would eat while the dust settled; then get to work cleaning (mucking) the tunnel. Of the 36-inch hole drilled only 18 inches, or half of the hole, was blasted.|$|R
50|$|The powder at {{this time}} was largely <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> {{to meet the demands}} of the {{construction}} of new railways, mining and quarrying.|$|R
60|$|But {{we went to}} work. We {{decided to}} sink a shaft. So, for a week we climbed the mountain, laden with picks, drills, gads, {{crowbars}}, shovels, cans of <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> and coils of fuse and strove with might and main. At first the rock was broken and loose and we dug it up with picks and threw it out with shovels, and the hole progressed very well. But the rock became more compact, presently, and gads and crowbars came into play. But shortly nothing could make an impression but <b>blasting</b> <b>powder.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 20th century, Pleasant Prairie was the site of a 190-acre DuPont <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> plant. The plant, made up of 40 buildings, had an ongoing record of accidents.|$|R
50|$|During the {{construction}} of the canal, <b>blasting</b> <b>powder,</b> which at the time was essentially gunpowder, was used to blast through solid rocks. This {{is one of the first}} known examples of <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> being used for engineering purposes anywhere in the world. The canal was never a profitable enterprise. With the completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal on the opposite side of the river, and the oncoming age of railroads, the project was abandoned in 1830. The canal is a Civil Engineering Landmark as well as a Virginia Historic Landmark. Along the trails, the ruins of the small town of Matildaville, Virginia can also be found.|$|R

50|$|After the Slave Trade Act 1807 {{the company}} {{switched}} {{largely to the}} manufacture of <b>blasting</b> <b>powder,</b> a market in which it became prominent. Daye Barker died in 1835. He was replaced in the company by his son of the same name.|$|R
2500|$|The current {{standard}} composition for {{the black}} powders that are manufactured by pyrotechnicians was adopted {{as long ago as}} 1780. Proportions by weight are 75% potassium nitrate (known as saltpeter or saltpetre), 15% softwood charcoal, and 10% sulfur. These ratios have varied over the centuries and by country, and can be altered somewhat depending on the purpose of the powder. For instance, power grades of black powder, unsuitable for use in firearms but adequate for blasting rock in quarrying operations, are called <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> rather than gunpowder with standard proportions of 70% nitrate, 14% charcoal, and 16% sulfur; <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> may be made with the cheaper sodium nitrate substituted for potassium nitrate and proportions may be as low as 40% nitrate, 30% charcoal, and 30% sulfur. In 1857, Lammot du Pont solved the main problem of using cheaper sodium nitrate formulations when he patented DuPont [...] "B" [...] <b>blasting</b> <b>powder.</b> After manufacturing grains from press-cake in the usual way, his process tumbled the powder with graphite dust for 12 hours. This formed a graphite coating on each grain that reduced its ability to absorb moisture.|$|R
50|$|In 1880, du Pont {{convinced}} his family {{that a new}} explosive, dynamite, would eventually make gunpowder obsolete. His vision eventually made the company {{a major force in}} the <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> industry. Later, he founded the Repauno Chemical Company and helped his family's company enter the high explosives business.|$|R
50|$|Miami Powder Company {{operated}} a gunpowder manufacturing complex on the Little Miami River at Goes Station, Ohio from 1855 to 1925. Willows growing {{along the banks}} of the Little Miami River provided the charcoal required for gunpowder. Production was approximately 75 percent rifle powder and 25 percent <b>blasting</b> <b>powder.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Within {{two years}} of William’s return, two {{additional}} plants had been built in Devon/Cornwall to make <b>blasting</b> <b>powder.</b> These were at Herodsfoot, Cornwall and at Powdermills on Dartmoor. Sodium nitrate was suitable for <b>blasting</b> <b>powder,</b> which {{was used in the}} mines and quarries of the region. [...] The sodium nitrate as received from Peru was of sufficient purity to be used without further treatment. This accounts for the absence at these two plants of the usual facilities for upgrading the potassium nitrate that came from India, which had a purity of only 65-70%. The manufacturing know-how probably came from the Perran Foundry. Barclay Fox, the owner of the Perran Foundry, certainly had some commercial interest in the second plant and a connection through the Quakers to the owners of the first.|$|R
50|$|Franklin W. Olin {{received}} an engineering degree from Cornell University in 1886. After working at gunpowder mills {{in the eastern}} United States, {{he was one of}} several investors establishing the Equitable Powder Company in 1892 at East Alton, Illinois. Production of <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> for southern Illinois coal mining began in 1893.|$|R
25|$|While {{the high}} school was being built, workers {{discovered}} a huge cache of <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> in a manhole adjacent to the construction site. Since the manhole itself had been dug only two months earlier and no mining or construction company in the area reported any explosives missing, the discovery was even more mysterious.|$|R
50|$|The first {{disaster}} was {{a result}} of a worker accidentally leaving a ventilating trap door open, resulting in a buildup of methane. It is believed that their coal lights ignited the methane and <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> kegs, which caused a severe explosion that killed 46 men and boys, most of whom suffocated from carbon monoxide inhalation.|$|R
2500|$|Robert Young {{was still}} {{trapped in the}} ice on January 21, 1930. [...] On January 22, 1930, crews from the Western Transportation Company tried using <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> to free Robert Young from the ice, so that the vessel {{could be used to}} aid another of the company’s sternwheelers, Claire, which was also trapped in the ice, at Oregon City.|$|R
25|$|At {{the upper}} end of the Gallery on the {{right-hand}} side there is a hole near the roof that opens into a short tunnel by which access can be gained to the lowest of the Relieving Chambers. The other Relieving Chambers were discovered in 1837-1838 by Colonel Howard Vyse and J. S. Perring, who dug tunnels upwards using <b>blasting</b> <b>powder.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Characterized as {{the worst}} {{disaster}} in the Yukon River's history, the sternwheeler Columbian exploded and burned at Eagle Rock, Yukon, Canada, on September25, 1906, killing six men. The steamer was carrying a crew of twenty-five men and a full cargo, including [...] cattle and three tons (2.722t) of <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> destined for the Tantalus coal mine, thirty miles (48km) downriver.|$|R
50|$|Lammot studied {{chemistry}} at the University of Pennsylvania, {{and obtained}} {{a bachelor of}} arts degree in 1849. He entered into the family business, and used his chemistry knowledge to patent B <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> in 1857. His invention used an inexpensive Peruvian and Chilean sodium nitrate, which he had discovered in 1858 {{could be used to}} manufacture black powder more cheaply than potassium nitrate.|$|R

25|$|Neither {{the use of}} {{graphite}} nor {{sodium nitrate}} was new. Glossing gunpowder corns with graphite was already an accepted technique in 1839, and sodium nitrate-based <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> {{had been made in}} Peru for many years using the sodium nitrate mined at Tarapacá (now in Chile). Also, in 1846, two plants were built in south-west England to make <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> using this sodium nitrate. The idea may well have been brought from Peru by Cornish miners returning home after completing their contracts. Another suggestion is that it was William Lobb, the planthunter, who recognised the possibilities of sodium nitrate during his travels in South America. Lammot du Pont would have known about the use of graphite and probably also knew about the plants in south-west England. In his patent he was careful to state that his claim was for the combination of graphite with sodium nitrate-based powder, rather than for either of the two individual technologies.|$|R
2500|$|On September 13, 1848, Gage was {{directing}} a work gang blasting rock while preparing the roadbed for the Rutland& Burlington Railroad {{south of the}} town of Cavendish, Vermont. Setting a blast entailed boring a hole deep into an [...] of rock; adding <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> and a fuse; then using the tamping iron to pack ("tamp") sand, clay, or other inert material into the hole above the powder.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Woodford, Vermont, and his father built mills and waterwheels. He studied civil {{engineering}} at Cornell University, where he also played baseball; he would play as an outfielder in the American Association for two seasons. After graduating with the class of 1886, he worked in several jobs before founding a <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> mill construction business; his first opened in East Alton, Illinois, in 1892.|$|R
60|$|The {{one little}} spark had {{found its way}} to a barrel of <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> and caused a terrible explosion. Within twenty-four hours of Jean-Marie's {{execution}} the whole town was in the throes of the Revolution. What the death of King Louis, the arrest of Marie Antoinette, the massacres of September had failed to do, that the arrest and execution of an elderly fisherman accomplished in a trice.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} <b>powder</b> <b>blasting</b> for {{the fabrication}} of glass microchips. <b>Powder</b> <b>blasting</b> is a fast and cheap technique {{with which we}} pattern channels in sodalime and pyrex glass with a width down to 100 µm. We combine the technique with appropriate bonding procedures to realise sealed microchannel structures. We study the transport of fluorescent dye solutions and fluorescent beads within channels made by <b>powder</b> <b>blasting</b> and in "classical" channels made by HF-etching. We find a remarkable difference in sign of the electric field induced flow for both types of channels and explain the observed strong plug broadening effects in the <b>powder</b> <b>blasted</b> channels...|$|R
25|$|The {{explosion}} {{happened after}} Murray passed his illicitly-held loaded rifle to Morgan, {{so that the}} fireman could take pot shots at a flock of ducks on the water. Morgan tripped and accidentally discharged the gun into the load of <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> stored on deck. Following the ensuing explosion and fire, the captain grounded the ship on shore; those not killed or injured by the blast jumped ashore to safety.|$|R

25|$|On {{the day of}} the accident, the Columbian was {{carrying}} only one passenger: Ernest Wynstanley, a stowaway who had sneaked aboard, pretending to be the caretaker of the cattle on board. He was to have been thrown off when the ship docked at Tantalus. In addition to the cattle, the Columbian was also carrying one hundred and fifty tons (136.08t) of vegetables and meat, along with three tons (2.722t) of <b>blasting</b> <b>powder.</b>|$|R

5000|$|We kid you {{not at all}} — {{really good}} science fiction is, from the {{editorial}} side of the desk, {{harder to come by}} than perfect diamonds. It has to be mined out of authors with patience and care and tact — and <b>blasting</b> <b>powder,</b> when nothing else will work. We can fill 196 pages every other month with really good science fiction. We cant do it on a monthly schedule. No one can.|$|R
5000|$|Under Morton's leadership, H. T. Hackney {{continued}} {{to expand its}} holdings. At one point, the company operated coal mines at Jellico and an automobile subsidiary, The H. T. Hackney Vehicle Company, and distributed products such as candy, <b>blasting</b> <b>powder,</b> industrial equipment, furniture, oil, produce, and saddles. [...] This diversification helped the company survive the collapse of Knoxville's wholesaling sector, which brought the closures of numerous decades-old firms such as Cowan, McClung and Company.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, {{the firm had}} some {{experience}} in maritime investigation, {{with the ability to}} determine causes for wrecks and explosions. When, in 1898, the USS Maine exploded in the harbour of Havana, Cuba, the U.S. War department engaged Merritt-Chapman to determine whether the unknown explosion came from inside the hull or outside. Investigators decided that it was external, and attributed it to <b>blast</b> <b>powder.</b> This incident became the precipitate cause of the Spanish-American War.|$|R
50|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} area when on July 16, 1908 two carloads of <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> being {{unloaded}} by the Northwest Improvement Company inexplicably exploded, {{killing at least}} nine people including miners, NIC store employees and a family with children living in a tent near the building. The explosion, located about three-quarters of a mile from Cle Elum's downtown, scattered debris and human remains and shattered windows across town. Accounts from residents equated the explosion to an earthquake.|$|R
25|$|Gunpowder, {{also known}} as black powder to {{distinguish}} it from modern smokeless gunpowder, is the earliest known chemical explosive. It consists of a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate (saltpeter). The sulfur and charcoal act as fuels while the saltpeter is an oxidizer. Because of its incendiary properties {{and the amount of}} heat and gas volume that it generates, gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms, rockets, fireworks, and as a <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> in quarrying, mining, and road building.|$|R
50|$|Austin Powder Company {{was founded}} in 1833 by {{brothers}} Daniel, Alvin, Lorenzo, Henry, and Linus Austin of Wilmington, Vermont. After exploring the market for gunpowder on the western frontier, they built and operated a gunpowder mill at Old Forge on the Cuyahoga River near Akron, Ohio. Early production was largely used as <b>blasting</b> <b>powder</b> for coal mining but some was sold as sporting rifle powder. In 1884 the company became the exclusive supplier of gunpowder for shotgun shells manufactured by Chamberlain Cartridge Company.|$|R
