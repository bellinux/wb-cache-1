5|$|Inside of his chansons, {{he often}} used a cantus firmus, {{sometimes}} a popular song whose origin {{can no longer}} be traced, as in Si j'avoye Marion. Other times he used a tune originally associated with a separate text; and still other times he freely composed an entire song, using no apparent external source material. Another technique he sometimes used was to take a popular song and write it as a canon with itself, in two inner voices, and write new melodic material above and around it, to a new text: he used this technique in one of his most famous chansons, Faulte d'argent ("The problem with money"), a song sung <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> wakes in bed with a prostitute, broke and unable to pay her.|$|E

5|$|This was {{followed}} by Pertjobaan Setia (A Test of Faithfulness) in 1931, a novel about {{a young man named}} Sjamsoeddin who is required to go on the hajj before he can marry Hajjah Salwiah, a rich merchant's daughter.

5|$|After {{the ambush}} the two {{apparent}} shooters {{ran from the}} buildings and fled in a Ford sedan; the car was later discovered to have been set on fire and destroyed. Aiello's body was loaded into the taxicab and taken to Garfield Park Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The coroner eventually removed 59 bullets, weighing over a pound, from the body. He was shot more times than any single victim of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. A third machine gun position, which was ultimately not used, was later discovered by police in another nearby building, which had been rented {{a week before the}} murder <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> gave the name Lon Celespe. Police, prosecutors and federal agents immediately and publicly speculated that Capone was behind the assassination, noting that the precision machine-gun ambush was typical of his attacks. However, at least one press story at the time speculated Moran could have been behind the hit. Prestogiacomo, fearful for his life, went into hiding for three days after Aiello's death before turning himself in to police. He was charged as an accessory before the fact of Aiello's murder, a charge also filed against John Sorce, an employee of Aiello's importing company. Detectives questioned whether Prestogiacomo provided Aiello's enemies with information about his whereabouts, something he vehemently denied. Police claimed Prestogiacomo was not cooperative and lied about his relationship with Aiello. The charges against Prestogiacomo went to a grand jury but were ultimately dropped. Frank Nitti was also wanted by police for questioning in connection with the murder.|$|E
