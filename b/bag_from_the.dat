5|$|Strong winds {{prevented}} Mawson {{from continuing}} for two days. Instead, he prepared for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the sledge, and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess kerosene for the stove, he boiled {{the remainder of}} the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in the sleeping <b>bag</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tent, Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day he read the burial service.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{includes}} a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can compete {{against each other in}} seven different game types: Beach, Raptor, Heist, War, Tank, Race and Deathmatch. In Beach, some players must go up through a beach and into a waiting escape vehicle, while others must stop them by firing at them from fixed positions. Raptor involves players controlling raptors to feed a baby dinosaur, while others play as cavemen that have to steal dinosaur eggs. Heist engrosses players in the robbery of a bank, where the goal is to retrieve a cash <b>bag</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> center of the level and run with it to the team's vault without being damaged. War can either be a traditional capture the flag mode or Total War, where players have to get the other teams gas canister and use it to release a chemical gas that annihilates the enemy. Similarly, in Tank players fight against each other by using tanks and grabbing chemical canisters that can release a lethal corrosive gas, destroying all the tanks that are outdoors. Race is a racing mode which provides two variations of the same course. Items can be acquired and used against opponents. Finally, there is a standard deathmatch mode where players fight against each other in shooting style from a third-person perspective. Players can set a number of different options for each game, such as score limit, number of lives, and inclusion of optional bots.|$|E
25|$|Filling air {{is usually}} {{supplied}} {{from the surface}} from a low pressure compressor, but for small lifts the diver may carry a cylinder of air for the purpose. It is considered bad practice in some jurisdictions to fill a lift <b>bag</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> diver's breathing gas cylinder, particularly if the diver has decompression obligations or only one cylinder as the risk of using up too much air and leaving the diver without sufficient air for a safe ascent is considered unacceceptable.|$|E

500|$|After {{finding a}} shotgun in the farmhouse, they shoot the leprechaun several times. [...] When this has no effect, {{they attempt to}} flee the farm, but their truck's engine has been sabotaged by the leprechaun. After ramming the truck with a go-kart, the leprechaun terrorizes the group until Ozzie reveals that he and Alex found the pot of gold. Tory recovers the <b>bag</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> well and gives it to the leprechaun. Believing the worst to be over, they leave for the hospital. While {{counting}} his gold, the leprechaun discovers that he is missing the gold piece Ozzie swallowed. Thinking that they have tricked him, he menaces them until Ozzie tells them about O'Grady, who {{was taken to a}} nursing home after his stroke. Tory visits the home to learn how to kill the leprechaun.|$|E

[...] She peruses Andrew's smartphone to find contacts and inform them about the whereabouts of Andrew's belongings.|$|E
2500|$|His baserunning was legendary {{in other}} ways as well. His arguably most {{frequent}} brilliant play was always legitimate—a feetfirst hook slide to avoid being tagged. In 1889, Tim Murnane of the Boston Globe said {{nine times out of}} ten, Kelly will [...] "throw himself {{out of the reach of}} the baseman, and catch the <b>bag</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outside." [...] Also, [...] "Kelly is not a sprinter, but can get a great start, and this counts more than a fine slide, as a catcher is likely to be hurried when he sees the runner well on his way to a base." ...|$|E

Javeri uses his photographs of Pakistan to create both prints and <b>bags</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> images. The [...] "Tapulicious" [...] bags were showcased in Fashion Pakistan Week 3 in April 2012 in Karachi.

2500|$|Activation {{begins when}} the pilot-chute is thrown out. It inflates and creates drag, pulling the pin {{out of the}} closing loop and {{allowing}} the pilot-chute to pull the deployment <b>bag</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> container. The parachute lines are pulled loose from the rubber bands and extend as the canopy starts to open. A rectangular piece of fabric called the [...] "slider" [...] (which separates the parachute lines into four main groups fed through grommets in the four respective corners of the slider) slows {{the opening of the}} parachute and works its way down until the canopy is fully open and the slider is just above the head of the skydiver. The slider slows and controls the deployment of the parachute. Without a slider, the parachute would inflate fast, potentially damaging the parachute fabric and/or suspension lines, as well as causing discomfort, injury or even death of the jumper. During a normal deployment, a skydiver will generally experience a few seconds of intense deceleration, in the realm of 3 to 4 g, while the parachute slows the descent from [...] to approximately 28km/h (17mph).|$|E
2500|$|Less than a {{week after}} his passing, Palmer's life was also celebrated by both teams at the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minnesota, just outside the Twin Cities.

During the matches, the players paid tribute to Palmer, which included wearing a special logo, button and pin. Palmer's <b>bag</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1975 Ryder Cup was also placed on the first tee as a tribute. Palmer had won more than 22 Ryder Cup matches and had also captained Team USA to two victories, in addition to holding or being tied for the records for youngest captain, most career singles points and most points in a single Ryder Cup.

2500|$|Sweeney was ejected {{in a game}} {{versus the}} Detroit Tigers on August 10 (1st career ejection) after {{charging}} pitcher Jeff Weaver in the sixth inning. Weaver, {{who was a member}} of the Tigers at the time, was pitching to Sweeney. In between pitches, Sweeney asked the home plate umpire if Weaver could [...] be asked to move the rosin <b>bag</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top of the mound. After that, Weaver put his glove over his mouth and appeared to say something [...] "Webster never put in his dictionary" [...] to Sweeney. Sweeney was offended and launched his batting helmet at Weaver while charging the pitcher's mound. He eventually tackled Weaver, igniting a bench-clearing brawl. Sweeney said afterwards that Weaver had been criticizing the Royals' younger players and Sweeney's faith. Sweeney's teammates did not deny his comments. Paul Byrd was one of the first to aid Sweeney as he held back the Tigers catcher so that Sweeney could reach Weaver. Sweeney missed the next 15 games, five due to a [...] "bruised hand" [...] and the next ten to serve a suspension, his first career suspension (prior to that, he had played in 171 consecutive games).|$|E

2500|$|Google has {{redesigned}} Google Play's interface {{on several}} occasions. In February 2011, Google introduced a website interface for then-named Android Market that provides access through a computer. Applications purchased are downloaded and installed on an Android device remotely, with a [...] "My Market Account" [...] section letting users give their devices a nickname for easy recognition. In May 2011, Google added new application lists to Android Market, including [...] "Top Paid", [...] "Top Free", [...] "Editor's Choice", [...] "Top Grossing", [...] "Top Developers", and [...] "Trending". In July, Google introduced an interface {{with a focus}} on featured content, more search filters, and (in the US) book sales and movie rentals. In May 2013, a redesign to the website interface matched the then-recently redesigned Android app. In July 2014, the Play Store Android app added new headers to the Books/Movies sections, a new Additional Information screen offering a list featuring the latest available app version, installed size, and content rating, and simplified the app permissions prompt into overview categories. A few days later, it got a redesign consistent with the then-new Material Design design language, [...] and the app was again updated in October 2015 to feature new animations, divide up the content into [...] "Apps and Games" [...] and [...] "Entertainment" [...] sections, as well as added support for languages read right-to-left.

In May 2017, Google removed the shopping <b>bag</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Google Play icon, with only the triangle and associated colors remaining.|$|E
