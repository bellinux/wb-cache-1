Dental records confirmed that the body was hers, and the police began a formal investigation into her murder. As of 2016 no one has been prosecuted in connection with this case.|$|E
25|$|Melanie Hall (20 August 1970 – {{disappeared}} 9 June 1996; declared legally dead 17 November 2004) was a British hospital {{clerical officer}} from Bradford on Avon, who disappeared on 9 June 1996, following {{a night out}} at the Cadillacs nightclub in Bath.
