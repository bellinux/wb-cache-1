We describe pertinent structural features of known antitumor Ti agents and other potentially active compounds. Particularly noteworthy features are that Ti-O bonds are short and Ti-O-Ti bond angles are large, demonstrating that in these compounds the O binding has high s-character approaching sp hybridization. /â€™he successful drug development/ 1 /of the antitumor agent cis-diaminodichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) 1, generated a search for other active metal compounds and cis-diethoxy-bis(1 -phenylbutane-l, 3 dionato) titanium(IV), [(bzac) 2 Ti(OEt) 2] (<b>budotitane)</b> 2, was the first non-Pt metal antitumor compound that reached clinical trials / 2 /. The ligand 1 -phenylbutane-l, 3 -dionato bzac benzoylacetonato, is an asymmetric [3 -diketone chelator useful tbr establishing one key structural feature tbr activity in <b>budotitane,</b> namely, the existence of two OEt cis leaving groups, which arc analogous to the 2 CI in cisplatin. Another Ti antitumor agent is titanocene dichloride, (Cp) 2 TiCI 2 3, Cp cyclopentadienyl, which possesses 2 CI leaving groups/ 5 /. Among the differences between Ti antitumor drugs and cisplatin is the spectrum of activity, as Ti drug...|$|E
