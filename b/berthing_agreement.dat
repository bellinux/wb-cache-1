50|$|On 5 February 2006 {{the museum}} closed due to being {{required}} to relocate. This was {{as a result of}} a decision to redevelop the adjacent Grade II listed former flour milling warehouses. Without a replacement <b>berthing</b> <b>agreement,</b> the Trust subsequently went into voluntary liquidation.By default, ownership of the collection transferred to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC) following the demise of the Trust.|$|E
50|$|On June 23, 2015, Branson of Virgin Group {{announced}} that three new ships {{were intended to}} be built by Fincantieri. The cruise line {{is scheduled to begin}} operations in 2020 out of Port of Miami with the delivery of its first ship. By July 3, 2015, the county commission was expected to vote on a five-year preferential <b>berthing</b> <b>agreement</b> with an optional five-year extension with the cruise line.|$|E
50|$|SeaLink holds {{a virtual}} {{monopoly}} on oversea transport, {{primarily due to}} its long term lease of the Cape Jervis <b>berth.</b> Sealink's <b>agreement</b> with the Government of South Australia, expiring in 2024, precludes other operators from utilising the Cape Jervis facility for one hour before, and one hour after any scheduled SeaLink service. Kangaroo Island residents have expressed displeasure with the exclusive arrangement granted to SeaLink.|$|R
25|$|With the {{introduction}} by SeaLink of the Island Navigator, {{the fate of}} Island Seaway was sealed, with the service subsequently withdrawn and SeaLink drawing on Government subsidies to operate all freight services {{to and from the}} Island. SeaLink now holds a virtual monopoly on sea transport to Kangaroo Island, primarily due to its long term lease of the Cape Jervis <b>berth.</b> Sealink's <b>agreement</b> with the SA Government, expiring in 2024, precludes other operators from using the Cape Jervis facility for one hour before, and one hour after any scheduled SeaLink service. Kangaroo Island residents have expressed displeasure with the exclusive arrangement granted to SeaLink.|$|R
30|$|Besides the {{positive}} effect of cost savings, {{the reduction of}} peak energy demand has consequences for the handling time. In most scenarios (depending on how much the number of simultaneously lifting cranes and energy demand per second is limited), the extra handling time would be less than half a minute per hour. The question is whether container carriers are willing to accept extra handling time. Container terminals need to be prepared to negotiate with container carriers about some sort of compensation. This could be financial, but might also relate to extra service (e.g. free electricity power for ships while <b>berthed)</b> or sustainability <b>agreements.</b> Irrespective of how costs are allocated, this research has shown that container terminals can reduce their peak-related energy costs by managing their energy consumption in a smarter way.|$|R
30|$|Among {{liner service}} design factors, {{operational}} {{strategies such as}} service frequency, number of ports of call, and number of strings, are discussed as significant. Shipping lines attempt to maintain network simplicity, with limited ports of call, considering the overall cost aspects of the entire service network. As an example, maintaining a single hub port to cover multiple neighboring regions could be cost effective, but it requires multiple feeder links. However, some shipping lines select ports not called by many other services to create and expand their cargo bases. As previously discussed, shipping lines with competitive advantages, such as {{the availability of a}} strong cargo base, and those with their own feeder services can experience high autonomy in hub port selection decisions. Moreover, the possibilities of obtaining berth windows, on-arrival <b>berths,</b> virtual terminal <b>agreements,</b> and so on are highlighted as important attractive features. Regarding network types, interviews revealed that, although hub and spoke networks dominate, shipping lines currently focus on relay networks as well due to the opportunities of deploying their own mainline vessels. However, a relay network cannot be used independently in many cases without counting on feeder lines due to the capacity limitations of minor ports.|$|R
