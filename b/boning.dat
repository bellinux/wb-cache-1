50|$|Cortical <b>bone,</b> {{synonymous with}} compact <b>bone,</b> {{is one of}} the two types of <b>bone</b> tissue that form <b>bones.</b> Cortical <b>bone</b> forms the {{extremely}} hard exterior of <b>bones.</b> Cortical <b>bone</b> facilitates <b>bone's</b> main functions: to support the whole body, protect organs, provide levers for movement, and store and release chemical elements, mainly calcium. As its name implies, cortical <b>bone</b> forms the cortex, or outer shell, of most <b>bones.</b> Cortical (compact) <b>bone</b> is much denser than cancellous <b>bone.</b> Furthermore, it is harder, stronger and stiffer than cancellous <b>bone.</b> Cortical <b>bone</b> contributes about 80% of the weight of a human skeleton. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cortical <b>bone</b> is the osteon.|$|R

25|$|Stays {{evolved in}} the 18th century when {{whalebone}} was used more, {{and there was more}} <b>boning</b> used in the garment. The shape of the stays changed as well. While the stays were low and wide in the front, they could reach as high as the upper shoulder in the back. Stays could be strapless or use shoulder straps. The straps of the stays were generally attached in the back and tied at the front sides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bone</b> mineral (also called {{inorganic}} <b>bone</b> phase, <b>bone</b> salt, or <b>bone</b> apatite) is the inorganic {{component of}} <b>bone</b> tissue.

25|$|Trabecular <b>bone</b> (or cancellous <b>bone)</b> is the sponge-like <b>bone</b> in {{the ends}} of long <b>bones</b> and vertebrae. Cortical <b>bone</b> is the hard outer shell of <b>bones</b> and the middle of long <b>bones.</b> Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of <b>bones,</b> trabecular <b>bone</b> is more active and is more subject to <b>bone</b> {{turnover}} and remodeling. Not only is <b>bone</b> density decreased, but the microarchitecture of <b>bone</b> is also disrupted. The weaker spicules of trabecular <b>bone</b> break ("microcracks"), and are replaced by weaker <b>bone.</b> Common osteoporotic fracture sites, the wrist, the hip and the spine, have a relatively high trabecular <b>bone</b> to cortical <b>bone</b> ratio. These areas rely on the trabecular <b>bone</b> for strength, so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced. Around the ages of 30–35, cancellous or trabecular <b>bone</b> loss begins. Women may lose as much as 50%, while men lose about 30%.|$|R

A person wearing a corset dress can have great difficulty in walking {{up and down the stairs}} (especially if wearing high-heeled footwear) and may be unable to sit down if the <b>boning</b> is too stiff.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, the 501 {{was given}} an improved, more {{powerful}} version of its six-cylinder engine and split into two models, the 501A at basically the same trim level and a price reduction of DM1,000, and a decontented 501B at a further price reduction of DM1,000 below the 501A's price. In addition, the 502, basically a 501 with an even higher trim level and a 2.6L aluminium V8 engine designed by <b>Bőning</b> and Fiedler, was introduced to lead BMW's luxury sedan range. The expanded line for 1954 doubled the sales of BMW's luxury cars.|$|E

50|$|The {{supporting}} alveolar <b>bone</b> {{consists of}} both cortical <b>bone</b> and trabecular <b>bone.</b> The cortical <b>bone,</b> or cortical plates, consists of plates of compact <b>bone</b> on the facial and lingual {{surfaces of the}} alveolar <b>bone.</b> These cortical plates are usually about 1.5 to 3 mm thick over posterior teeth, but the thickness is highly variable around anterior teeth. The trabecular <b>bone</b> consists of cancellous <b>bone</b> that is located between the alveolar <b>bone</b> proper and the plates of cortical <b>bone.</b> The alveolar <b>bone</b> between two neighboring teeth is the interdental septum (or interdental <b>bone).</b>|$|R
50|$|The raw {{material}} for <b>bone</b> china is about 50% <b>bone</b> ash derived from animal <b>bones.</b> These <b>bones</b> undergo multiple processing stages during which all meat is removed and the <b>bone</b> is completely cleaned. Once cleaned, the <b>bone</b> is heated to about 1000 °C (1832 °F) so that all additional organic material {{is removed from the}} <b>bone</b> and the <b>bone</b> becomes sterilized. Lastly, the newly sterilized <b>bone</b> is ground with water into fine particles which {{can be used as a}} {{raw material}} for <b>bone</b> china. <b>Bone</b> ash plays an important role in the creation of <b>bone</b> china, as the phosphate of the <b>bone</b> generates beta tricalcium phosphate, and other compounds from the <b>bone</b> create a calcium crystal called anorthite.

25|$|On April 30 {{during a}} quarterfinal match with Magdalena Maleeva in Hamburg in which Seles was leading, Günter Parche, an obsessed fan of Steffi Graf, {{ran from the}} middle of the crowd to the edge of the court during a break between games and stabbed Seles with a <b>boning</b> knife between her {{shoulder}} blades, to a depth of 1.5cm (0.59inches). She was quickly rushed to a hospital. Although her physical injuries took only a few weeks to heal, she did not return to competitive tennis for more than two years. Initially, there was speculation that the attack might have been politically motivated because Seles was from Yugoslavia. She was known to have received death threats in relation to the ongoing conflict in her native Yugoslavia. However, German authorities were quick to rule this out, describing her attacker as confused and possibly mentally disturbed.|$|E

30|$|<b>Bone</b> {{quality is}} a generic {{term for the}} {{characterization}} of <b>bone</b> tissue in three dimensions: the structural quality, related {{to the amount of}} the cortical <b>bone</b> and to the trabecular <b>bone</b> pattern; the <b>bone</b> density, related to the amount of <b>bone</b> mineralization and/or the amount of <b>bone</b> by its volume; and the amount of <b>bone,</b> related to the volume of <b>bone</b> available [3]. <b>Bone</b> quality varies intra- and inter-subject depending on the thickness of cortical <b>bone,</b> the amount of trabecular <b>bone,</b> and the amount of <b>bone</b> tissue mineralization in the region of interest for implant placement [4]. Some classifications of <b>bone</b> quality have considered cortical <b>bone</b> thickness and trabecular <b>bone</b> structure based on preoperative panoramic radiographs and tactile perception during exploratory drilling of the implant site; <b>bone</b> density based on the tactile sensation and Hounsfield units of computed tomography (CT) images; radiographic pattern of trabecular bone; and intra-surgical <b>bone</b> density and biopsy with histomorphometric evaluation [5 – 8]. However, most classifications of <b>bone</b> quality for routine clinical use still are not validated by using objective and subjective assessment methods.|$|R

40|$|UNLABELLED: This {{study shows}} that change to cancellous <b>bone</b> {{structure}} is <b>bone</b> volume-dependent in a nonlinear manner.

This suggests that the structural integrity of the cancellous <b>bone</b> may become rapidly compromised when <b>bone</b> volume falls below a critical value. INTRODUCTION: While <b>bone</b> mass is the major determinant of <b>bone</b> strength, this mass-based paradigm does not fully account for {{the contribution of the}} <b>bone</b> microstructure to mechanical efficiency. Geometric models of cancellous <b>bone</b> structure have been formulated based on stylized representations of the trabecular elements, where the relationships between <b>bone</b> volume and <b>bone</b> surface of cancellous <b>bone</b> are complex and reflect the modulating effect on the cancellous <b>bone</b> structure of <b>bone</b> remodeling at the trabecular surfaces. Using the plate model of cancellous <b>bone</b> structure, the interrelationships between parameters of cancellous <b>bone</b> structure have been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty histological sections of human cancellous <b>bone</b> from eight skeletal sites were analyzed. The structural parameters of cancellous <b>bone</b> (BV/TV, BS/TV, BS/BV, Tb. Th, Tb. Sp, Tb. N, and TBPf) were obtained. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This {{study shows that}} change to cancellous <b>bone</b> structure is <b>bone</b> volume-dependent in a nonlinear manner. At low <b>bone</b> volume (< 15 %), structural parameters of cancellous <b>bone,</b> such as trabecular thickness and trabecular separation, change at a much greater rate than at higher <b>bone</b> volume. This suggests that the structural integrity of the cancellous <b>bone</b> may become rapidly compromised when <b>bone</b> volume falls below a critical value. These data describe the complex relationships between <b>bone</b> mass and structure in cancellous <b>bone</b> that are often overlooked in the mass-based paradigm of <b>bone</b> strength. Histomorphometric descriptors of cancellous <b>bone</b> structure highlight the potential for accelerated deterioration of the structure with low <b>bone</b> volume, which leads to increased risk of fracture. From a clinical viewpoint, estimation of an individual's fracture risk is constrained to noninvasive techniques, which only provide <b>bone</b> mineral density or <b>bone</b> mineral content. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} better correlate measurement of <b>bone</b> mass with measurements of structural parameters...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract <b>Bone</b> remodeling, the fundamental process for <b>bone</b> renewal, is targeted by treatments of osteoporosis {{to correct the}} imbalance between <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation and {{reduce the risk of}} fractures and associated clinical consequences. Currently available therapeutics affect <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation in the same direction and either decrease (inhibitors of <b>bone</b> resorption) or increase (parathyroid hormone [PTH] peptides) <b>bone</b> remodeling. Studies of patients with rare <b>bone</b> diseases and genetically modified animal models demonstrated that <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation may not necessarily be coupled, leading to identification of molecular targets in <b>bone</b> cells for the development of novel agents for the treatment of osteoporosis. Application of such agents to the treatment of women with low <b>bone</b> mass confirmed that <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation can be modulated in different directions and so far two new classes of thera-peutics for osteoporosis have been defined with distinct mechanisms of action. Such treatments, if combined with a favorable safety profile, will offer new therapeutic options and will improve the management of patients with osteoporosis. Key Points In osteoporosis, there is an imbalance between <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation leading to <b>bone</b> loss and structural decay of the skeleton. Currently available therapeutics affect <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation in the same direction and either decrease (inhibitors of <b>bone</b> resorption) or increase (PTH peptides) <b>bone</b> remodeling. New classes of therapeutics for osteoporosis with different mechanisms of action are in clinical development. Inhibitors of Cathepsin K reduce <b>bone</b> resorption while preserving <b>bone</b> formation and increase <b>bone</b> mineral density at the spine and the hip continuously for at least 5 years of treatment. Inhibitors of sclerostin increase <b>bone</b> formation while reducing <b>bone</b> resorption and impressively increase <b>bone</b> mineral density at the spine and the hip. ...|$|R
