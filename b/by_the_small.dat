5|$|Because of {{the colored}} volva, A.atkinsoniana resembles A.onusta, which differs from A.atkinsoniana <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> to {{medium-sized}} fruit bodies with a grayish veil as dark gray to brownish gray warts and a basal bulb {{which is usually}} somewhat rooting. Sometimes the fruit bodies of A.atkinsoniana are confused with A.microlepsis which can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} reddish-brown to grayish-brown volval remnants and the rooting bulb of A.atkinsoniana.|$|E

He {{moved into the}} {{expansive}} Diocletian's Palace, a heavily fortified compound located <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> town of Spalatum {{on the shores of}} the Adriatic Sea, and near the large provincial administrative center of Salona. The palace is preserved in great part to this day and forms the historic core of Split, the second-largest city of modern Croatia.|$|E

The new species differs from P. didelphidis (Parona, 1896) <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> size of body, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of spinous tegument and ventral sucker smaller than oral sucker; from P. parumbursaitus Freitas & Dobbin Jr., 1961 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> size {{of body and}} suckers and the bigger size of eggs; from P. rangeli Artigas & Zerpa, 1961 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bigger size of suckers and eggs; and front P. freitasi Vicente, 1978 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> size of body, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bigger size of eggs and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> different position of gonads that in the new species {{are close to the}} ventral sucker...|$|R
5|$|Gyeongju's {{drainage}} {{patterns are}} shaped by these lines of mountains. The Dongdae Mountains divide a narrow foothills area on their east, and various internal river systems to the west. Most of the city's interior is drained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> Hyeongsan River, which flows north from Ulsan and meets the sea at Pohang Harbor. The Hyeongsan's chief tributaries include the Bukcheon and Namcheon, which join it in Gyeongju Basin.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two-thirds of}} its present {{territory}} were occupied during the colonial period, as the remaining third consisted of the Patagonian Plateau, which remains sparsely populated to this day. The agricultural and livestock sector's output was principally consumed by the producers themselves and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> local market, and only became associated with foreign trade {{towards the end of}} the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} well-received and, despite various issues, it was lauded by critics {{as one of}} the best air combat {{simulators}} of the time and particularly praised for its accessible gameplay. The game was developed with a budget of £40k <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> UK-based Cascade Games, who later produced two sequels to the game.|$|E

5000|$|Thymopides {{differs from}} related genera such as Homarus, Homarinus and Nephrops in having the {{first pair of}} pereiopods of similar size and shape, rather than one [...] "crusher" [...] and one [...] "cutter" [...] claw. It differs from others, such as Metanephrops and Eunephrops <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of a carina behind <b>the</b> antennal spine, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> size of some spines and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller,</b> unpigmented eyes.|$|R

5|$|The queen's pyramid complex {{had its own}} {{separate}} mortuary temple, {{which was}} located on {{the east of the}} pyramid in contrast to Userkaf's complex. This difference may be explained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> dimensions of the temple which allowed it to be oriented to the east in the usual fashion.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} partly self-compatible, as some seed is set when pollinators are excluded. Selection against self-pollinated seed has been observed, but the species has {{nonetheless}} {{been shown to}} have one of the lowest outcrossing rates of any Banksia. This is probably caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> population sizes, which increase the probability of self-fertilisation, and may discourage visits by pollinators.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop can be {{distinguished}} from its close relative the Pacific pink scallop (Chlamys rubida) by the valves being less rounded and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> curved spines on the ribs which give it a rough texture whereas the Pacific pink feels smooth. The glossy white interior of the spiny scallop's shell often has a purplish blotch near the umbone, not present in the Pacific pink.|$|E

5|$|The water bull {{is said to}} {{reproduce}} with standard cattle, the resulting progeny distinguishable <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> size of their ears. According to some myths, the calves of water bulls and ordinary cows ought to be killed at birth by any method other than drowning– they cannot be killed by drowning– to avoid bringing disaster to the herd. Conversely, in northern areas the calves {{are considered to be}} of superior quality.|$|E
5|$|A {{snowflake}} is {{a single}} ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> crystal facets.|$|E
5|$|An early {{estimate}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Small</b> Business Administration put total {{damage in}} Gilroy {{at twice the}} amount of what was seen in Hollister. Ten people were brought to Hazel Hawkins Memorial Hospital in Hollister for treatment of lacerations, a cardiac problem, and anxiety. In Gilroy, the Wheeler Hospital saw six similar cases and a patient with a fractured hip. Most of those that sought care (including four that were transported by ambulance) were treated and released, but six were admitted.|$|E

5|$|At 14:00 on 8 February, {{four days}} after leaving the Îles des Saintes, Junon was spotted passing close to the Virgin Islands <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> British brigs HMS Superieure and , who signalled the {{approaching}} ship to halt and prepare for boarding. Ignoring the orders from the smaller ships, Rousseau continued northwards, passing through the Virgin Islands closely followed by Superieure, although Asp was unable to keep up and fell far behind during the night. At 08:00 {{on the morning of}} 9 February, with Virgin Gorda northwest, Superieure was close enough to open fire, a few long range shots failing to damage the large frigate, which responded with an ineffective broadside. The gunfire attracted other ships, and during the afternoon Superieure was joined by the British frigate HMS Latona, under Captain Hugh Pigot.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to escape}} {{under cover of}} {{darkness}} on 14 April, the French squadron was spotted by a number of small British ships stationed close inshore. These ships raised the alarm and the main British squadron followed in pursuit. The rearmost French ship of the line, Hautpoult, was closely followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> brig HMS Recruit, which succeeded in delaying Hautpoult long enough that the main British squadron was able to attack and overwhelm her in a running battle that lasted three days and ended off the coast of Puerto Rico. The British suffered 45 casualties, the French nearly 100. The remainder of the French squadron escaped, with the two surviving ships of the line sailing directly for France, eventually reaching Cherbourg in May.|$|E
5|$|In late February, ground sensors {{detected}} the 66th Regiment, 304th NVA Division preparing {{to mount an}} attack on the positions of the 37th ARVN Ranger Battalion on the eastern perimeter. On the night of 28 February the Combat Base unleashed artillery and airstrikes on possible North Vietnamese staging areas and routes of advance. At 21:30, the attack came on, but it was stifled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> arms of the Rangers, who were supported by thousands of artillery rounds and air strikes. Two further attacks later in the morning were halted before the North Vietnamese finally withdrew. NVA, however, was not through with the ARVN troops. Five more attacks against their sector were launched during the month of March.|$|E

5|$|Invisible Circles is {{the third}} studio album by Dutch symphonic metal band After Forever. It was {{released}} on 25 March 2004, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> Dutch label Transmission Records. It is After Forever's first full-length album since the dismissal of guitarist and composer Mark Jansen, whose musical tastes had strongly influenced {{the sound of their}} first work Prison of Desire (2000) and their successful second offering Decipher (2001). In this work After Forever choose a new musical direction, mostly revolving around elements of progressive metal instead of the gothic and symphonic metal of previous albums. The creative process for Invisible Circles took {{more than a year and}} required the use of three recording studios in the Netherlands and Germany. A long tour to support the album brought the band to some of the most important European rock festivals and to Central and South America.|$|E
5|$|Koniecpolski now {{recognized}} the need to reform his army and strengthen the firepower of its infantry and artillery to match the Swedes'. The Swedes, on the other hand, had learned the arts of cavalry charges and melée combat from the Poles. Overall the 1627 campaign had been favorable to the Commonwealth; Puck and Gniew had been retaken, Swedish plans had been thwarted, and the Swedish army had been weakened. The last major engagement of the year saw the surprising defeat of a Swedish flotilla <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> Polish Navy on 28 November 1627 at the Battle of Oliwa.|$|E
