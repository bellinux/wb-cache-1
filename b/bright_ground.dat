Under such circumstances, the picture may have been executed at once on the sized outline. In the works of Lucas van Leyden, and sometimes in those of Albert Dürer, the thin yet brilliant lights exhibit a still brighter ground underneath (p. 389).... It thus appears that the method proposed by the inventors of oil-painting, of preserving light within the colors, involved a certain order of processes. The principal conditions were: first, that the outline should be completed on the panel before the painting, properly so called, was begun. The object, in thus defining the forms, was to avoid alterations and repaintings, which might ultimately render the ground useless without supplying its place. Another condition was to avoid loading the opaque colors. This limitation was not essential {{with regard to the}} transparent colors, as such could hardly exclude the <b>bright</b> <b>ground</b> (p. 398).... The system of coloring adopted by the Van Eycks may have been influenced by the practice of glass-painting. They appear, in their first efforts at least, to have considered the white panel as representing light behind a colored and transparent medium, and aimed at giving brilliancy to their tints by allowing the white ground to shine through them. If those painters and their followers erred, it was in sometimes too literally carrying out this principle. Their lights are always transparent (mere white excepted) and their shadows sometimes want depth. This is in accordance with the effect of glass-staining, in which transparency may cease with darkness, but never with light. The superior method of Rubens consisted in preserving transparency chiefly in his darks, and in contrasting their lucid depth with solid lights (p. 408).... Among the technical improvements on the older process may be especially mentioned the preservation of transparency in the darker masses, the lights being loaded as required. The system of exhibiting the <b>bright</b> <b>ground</b> through the shadows still involved an adherence to the original method of defining the composition at first; and the solid painting of the lights opened the door to that freedom of execution which the works of the early masters wanted."

6000|$|Again I {{followed}} the woodland paths along which I had once idled so happily {{with my little}} Mary. At every step I saw something {{that reminded me of}} her. Here was the rustic bench on which we had sat together under the shadow of the old cedar-tree, and vowed to be constant to each other to the end of our lives. There was the bright little water spring, from which we drank when we were weary and thirsty in sultry summer days, still bubbling its way downward to the lake as cheerily as ever. As I listened to the companionable murmur of the stream, I almost expected to see her again, in her simple white frock and straw hat, singing to the music of the rivulet, and freshening her nosegay of wild flowers by dipping it in the cool water. A few steps further on and I reached a clearing in the wood and stood on a little promontory of rising ground which commanded the prettiest view of Greenwater lake. A platform of wood was built out from the bank, to be used for bathing by good swimmers who were not afraid of a plunge into deep water. I stood on the platform and looked round me. The trees that fringed the shore on either hand murmured their sweet sylvan music in the night air; the moonlight trembled softly on the rippling water. Away on my right hand I could just see the old wooden shed that once sheltered my boat in the days when Mary went sailing with me and worked the green flag. On my left was the wooden paling that {{followed the}} curves of the winding creek, and beyond it rose the brown arches of the decoy for wild fowl, now falling to ruin for want of use. Guided by the radiant moonlight, I could see the very spot on which Mary and I had stood to watch the snaring of the ducks. Through the hole in the paling before which the decoy-dog had shown himself, at Dermody's signal, a water-rat now passed, like a little black shadow on the <b>bright</b> <b>ground,</b> and was lost in the waters of the lake. Look where I might, the happy by-gone time looked back in mockery, and the voices of the past came to me with their burden of reproach: See what your life was once! Is your life worth living now? ...|$|E

40|$|Two recent {{experiments}} {{contributing to}} the analysis of temporal resolution in human foveal vision are reviewed. First, the critical duration for the detection of a single line on a <b>bright</b> <b>ground</b> is determined. When the line is brighter than the ground, critical duration amounts to 4 · 10 − 3 s as opposed to 12 · 10 ‒ 3 s when the line is darker than the ground. This difference is discussed in connection with ON- and OFF- centre retinal ganglion cells in primates. Relations to possible physiological substrates of feature binding are sketched. Second, apparent motion generated by successive onset of two adjacent lines on a <b>bright</b> <b>ground</b> is studied. Psychophysical thresholds for the detection of temporal order of the onset of two dark lines are determined for different distances of the lines. The minimum of the distance function found is very narrow centering around 3 This is small compared to the distance function measured in earlier experiments and when the lines are brighter than the background. This difference indicates that the signals of ON- and OFF- centre ganglion cells are processed separately in the perception of local motion. Findings and conclusions are discussed with respect to earlier anatomical and physiological findings in the visual cortex of primates...|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} and optical properties of self-assembled InN/GaN quantum dots (QDs) are investigated {{by means of}} a tight-binding model combined with configuration interaction calculations. Tight-binding single particle wave functions are used as a basis for computing Coulomb and dipole matrix elements. Within this framework, we analyze multi-exciton emission spectra for two different sizes of a lens-shaped InN/GaN QD with wurtzite crystal structure. The impact of the symmetry of the involved electron and hole one-particle states on the optical spectra is discussed in detail. Furthermore we show how the characteristic features of the spectra can be interpreted using a simplified Hamiltonian which provides analytical results for the interacting multi-exciton complexes. We predict a vanishing exciton and biexciton ground state emission for small lens-shaped InN/GaN QDs. For larger systems we report a <b>bright</b> <b>ground</b> state emission but with drastically reduced oscillator strengths caused by the quantum confined Stark effect.

Combined satellite and ground based closures enable the determination of required aerosol characteristics for a remote sensing of aerosol optical thickness over bright surfaces. resolution of the radiometer is 1 km reduced up to 300 m full resolved.
