5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, and may <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> primitive living neopteran insects.

The mouthparts are {{on the underside of}} the head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E

5|$|Dementia, and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's disease, may <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their costs {{in other countries}} such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100billion each year.|$|E
5|$|Flynn {{has divided}} film critics. While some reviewers enjoyed the character's {{refreshing}} humor, rebelliousness and sarcasm {{in comparison to}} traditional Disney princes, others found his personality to be annoying and obnoxious, while panning his narration. Additionally, Flynn has also been strongly {{accused of being a}} marketing tool exploited by Disney to attract a larger male audience to Tangled. However, both the character's romantic comedy-esque relationship with Rapunzel and Levi's vocal performance have received widespread acclaim. Flynn is also considered to <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> appealing Disney heroes by Vanity Fair, E! and Cosmopolitan.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson's boasting and exaggerated claims {{concerning}} his war experiences, {{together with his}} depressive and temperamental personality, made him many enemies in both the USA and Britain. Roger Fry of the Bloomsbury Group was a particularly virulent critic. In 1920, the critic Charles Lewis Hind observed in his catalogue introduction to an exhibition of Nevinson's recent work: 'It is something, {{at the age of}} thirty one, to <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> discussed, most successful, most promising, most admired and most hated British artists.' In September 1920, Nevinson designed a poster for a production, by Viola Tree, of The Unknown by Somerset Maughan which showed bombs exploding around a crucifix. The image was deemed to be offensive and was banned from display on the London Underground. Nevinson distributed the poster outside the theatre and gained a great deal of press coverage in the process.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of the war, Nevinson {{travelled}} to the United States of America, where he painted a number of powerful images of New York. However, his boasting and exaggerated claims of his war experiences, together with his depressive and temperamental personality, made him many enemies in both the USA and Britain. In 1920, the critic Charles Lewis Hind wrote of Nevinson that 'It is something, at the age of thirty one, to <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> discussed, most successful, most promising, most admired and most hated British artists.' His post-war career, however, was not so distinguished. Nevinson's 1937 memoir Paint and Prejudice, although lively and colourful, is in parts inaccurate, inconsistent, and misleading.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{opposed the}} {{military}} escalation {{in response to}} {{events such as the}} Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs invasion, but his strongest opposition was to U.S. involvement in South Vietnam. His opposition grew in strength after he retired from the military in 1963; he was hostile to both the strategy of the conflict and the excessive influence of corporations and military officials upon foreign policy. His high-profile criticism later spread to include the military industrial complex and what he saw as a pervasive militarism in American culture. Historians consider Shoup's statements opposing the war to <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> pointed and high-profile leveled by a veteran against the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher {{reformed}} {{local government}} taxes by replacing domestic rates (a tax {{based on the}} nominal rental value of a home) with the Community Charge (or poll tax) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident. The new tax was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales the following year, and proved to <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> unpopular policies of her premiership. Public disquiet culminated in a 70,000 to 200,000-strong demonstration in London on 31 March 1990; the demonstration around Trafalgar Square deteriorated into riots, leaving 113 people injured and 340 under arrest. The Community Charge was abolished in 1991 by her successor, John Major. It has since transpired that Thatcher had herself failed to register for the tax, and was threatened with financial penalties {{if she did not}} return her form.|$|E

5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its Yucca Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards {{set a limit of}} 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E
5|$|The font has a Norman {{bowl with}} lead lining {{set on a}} 19th-century base. It {{consists}} of a round bowl carved with figures, and simple ornamentation. For many years {{it had been in}} the garden of nearby Dorfold Hall before being reinstated in the church. At the east end of the south aisle are carved stones, some in sandstone, others in limestone. The style of the limestone stones suggests a date at the end of the 11thcentury and that of the sandstone stones around 1100. They are considered to <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> significant pieces of Romanesque sculpture in the country. There is a ring of six bells. Five of these were cast by Rudhall of Gloucester in the 18thcentury and the sixth by John Taylor & Co in 1893. The parish registers begin in 1653 and the churchwardens' accounts in 1755. The two-manual organ was made by Alex Young and Sons of Manchester in 1897, and was renovated in 1939, and again in 1997.|$|E

5|$|The forest cobra {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{frequent}} causes of snake bite among the African cobras, largely due its forest-dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja (True Cobra) species. The symptomology is thought to be very {{similar to that of the}} Egyptian cobra (Naja haje). Clinical experience with this species has been very sparse, and few recorded bites have been documented. Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported, but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted. Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific antivenom have also been seen; however, neglecting the use of antivenom places the patient at increased risk for major morbidity and mortality. If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated, it can quickly attack the aggressor, and because a large amount of venom is injected, a rapidly fatal outcome is possible. The mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high. The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom. This species is considered to <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> intelligent of the African elapids by herpetologists.|$|E
