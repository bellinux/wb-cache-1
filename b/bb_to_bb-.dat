The data sample comprises (84. 4 +- 0. 9) X 10 e 6 upsilon(4 S) to B B-bar decays (77. 8 /fb) collected with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II B factory. For B to K l+ l-, we observe a signal with estimated significance of 4. 4 sigma and obtain <b>B(B</b> <b>to</b> K l+ l-) = (0. 78 + 0. 24 - 0. 20 + 0. 11 - 0. 18) X 10 e- 6 (averaged over l = e and mu).

The obtained branching fractions are <b>B(B</b> <b>to</b> pi+ l nu) = (1. 12 +- 0. 18 +- 0. 05) x 1 E- 4, <b>B(B</b> <b>to</b> pi 0 l nu) = (0. 66 +- 0. 12 +- 0. 03) x 1 E- 4, <b>B(B</b> <b>to</b> rho+ l nu) = (2. 56 +- 0. 46 +- 0. 12) x 1 E- 4, <b>B(B</b> <b>to</b> rho 0 l nu) = (1. 80 +- 0. 23 +- 0. 07) x 1 E- 4 and <b>B(B</b> <b>to</b> omega l nu) = (1. 19 +- 0. 32 +- 0. 05) x 1 E- 4, where the first error in each case is statistical and the second systematic. The partial branching fractions as a function of q 2 are extracted using three q 2 bins. At low q 2, the combined charged and neutral pion branching fractions and a Light Cone Sum Rules prescription imply |Vub| = (3. 1 +- 0. 2 +- 0. 1 {+ 0. 5 - 0. 3 }) x 1 E- 3, while using the high q 2 data and two different lattice prescriptions implies |Vub| = (3. 1 +- 0. 3 +- 0. 1 {+ 0. 6 - 0. 4 }) x 1 E- 3 (HPQCD) and |Vub| = (3. 3 +- 0. 4 +- 0. 1 {+ 0. 6 - 0. 4 }) x 1 E- 3 (FNAL) respectively. In each case the errors are statistical, systematic and theoretical (associated with the prescription used). These results are obtained from a data sample that contains 657 x 1 E 6 BBbar pairs, collected near the Upsilon(4 S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e+ e- collider.

RESULTS: Bbs showed a heterogeneous morphology, with variable numbers and staining intensity. The diameter of Bbs was approximately equivalent to that of a parabasal/intermediate squamous cell. Special stains showed <b>Bbs</b> <b>to</b> be positive for periodic acid-Schiff and methyl green pyronin and negative for mucicarmine and calcium. Immunohistochemistry revealed <b>Bbs</b> <b>to</b> be positive for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen and carcinoembryonic antigen and negative for vimentin and muscle-specific actin. Some Bbs had residual ghost nuclear shadows. Electron microscopy revealed cellular skeletons with residual tonofilaments enmeshed within a loose cytoskeleton matrix and nuclei with variable degrees of degeneration.
