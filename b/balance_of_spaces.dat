40|$|The deep {{crisis of}} living finds in the {{university}} residences a multidisciplinary field of design experimentation, as well as typological and technological research, that stimulates the investigation of {{issues such as the}} identity and the cohesion of social housing and the research for shared life forms and new paradigms for contemporary living. The university residences are a real form of elective neighborhood where private spaces and collective services coexist in a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>spaces</b> and relationships that ensure users, according to the principles of economic and environmental sustainability, maximum privacy in the residential area and, at the same time, the possibility to share rooms and common spaces (study rooms, kitchens, canteens, gyms, recreational spaces, green spaces, bike sharing services, etc.). Besides being examples of low cost and high performance, the university residences are an interesting reference also for other forms of collective living, for their potentialities {{in the development of the}} relation between individual and community, through a link between private and collective spaces. The university residences can determine new lifestyles and values of identity that, especially in Italy, end in an opening towards the city, with positive effects in terms of regeneration, integration and revitalization quality of living. The activity of investigation and monitoring of more than 300 projects of redevelopment and new construction that, in accordance with Law 338 / 00, have been awarded the state co-financing for building and retrofitting of residences for university students, has shown that the implementation of a beware policy of territorial government guarantees a real and immediate impact on the urban scale, so as to configure the university residences as indicators measuring economic and social value of a community. The research carried out for the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research allowed to verify programs and political strategies, methodologies and design tools, and not in the last case, the ways of execution and management of public and private entities. In conclusion, from the large collection of case studies and best practices, the paper will present one project, located in Venice, that contributed to regenerate rundown neighborhood and abandoned structure through urban and social procedures of mending, by recovering and increasing important buildings...|$|E

Analytical {{description}} of stationary average temperature of such object {{in view of}} the existence of internal sources of thermal emissions and sunlight absorbed by its surface is received. Mathematical model, describing thermal <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> object, is presented by the uniform equation combining two private models. One model considers heat irradiation from the object into space and radiation towards the Earth as well. The second one considers a shielding of a radiation stream into space by the Earth only. The choice of a model is defined by the direction of resultant radiation stream between object and the Earth. Functions describing high-rise dependences <b>of</b> temperature for <b>space</b> object <b>of</b> the spherical form are received. In the Earth shadow the choice of a model and the formulas, describing temperature for space object, is defined by the value of specific power of thermal emissions and its temperature level. On a solar site of a trajectory the choice of high-rise function type depends also on the ratio between coefficient of sunlight absorption and the degree of blackness for object surface. Criteria are offered making it possible to choose the function type, describing the relative change of object temperature with the height growth, prior to the beginning of calculations. Results of calculations carried out with the usage of high-rise functions, following from two models, are presented, and the limits of applicability for these functions are specified. Deduced analytical formulas give the possibility to calculate the temperature <b>of</b> spherical <b>space</b> object.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the impact of urban {{geometry}} in the overall energy <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> indoor <b>spaces.</b> Buildings are not analysed as single entities, but are considered as components of the urban fabric at the wider scale of the block and the neighbourhood. The hypothesis is that significant energy savings in indoor spaces can be achieved by controlling urban geometry variables (shape, orientation, height and density of buildings, glazing ratio) typically defined in the initial stages of master-planning design. The authors propose a tool for quantifying energy contributions of both lighting and heating, revealing the energy-based implications of formal design choices. The results of this study outline the impact of different energy contributions in the total energy <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> buildings considered in their urban environment. Whereas heating energy consumption depends relatively little on the arrangement of the urban shape – mainly due to solar gains – the energy consumption for lighting reveals itself to be more affected by urban geometry. An efficient mix of natural and artificial lighting with a sustainable energy urban design offers effective challenges to obtain significant energy savings and less environmental impact...|$|R

40|$|The Humane Co-house design-led {{research}} project presents a new typology for shared medium-density housing sited in a city-fringe Wellington suburb. The research argues communal living can be utilised to achieve smaller dwellings, a high medium-density grain, a humane living environment {{and a new}} form of social interaction that home buyers will find desirable. Buying a home is difficult throughout New Zealand and Wellington is no exception. Inner-city apartment blocks lack individuality, space for growing families and a sense of community and autonomy. While research shows houses in outer suburbs are perceived to provide these, they come at a high price and there are low amounts of available stock. There is potential for city-fringe suburbs adjacent to the inner city to accommodate more dwellings, creating available housing stock that is appealing to buyers who would otherwise be looking at expensive suburban houses. The research begins with the current attitudes and preferences within the New Zealand housing context, and suggests that the appeal of the traditional detached suburban house is intertwined with a desired <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> private <b>space</b> to common space. The research designs and develops a new typology that attempts to achieve this balance, but with smaller dwellings at a high medium-density. Through design-led research an architectural definition and manifestation of a humane dwelling is formed. This focuses on a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> private <b>space</b> and common <b>space.</b> Qualities <b>of</b> common and private spaces within a dwelling are explored through literature and design tests. Evaluation of design case studies produced from research, tests and iterations draws conclusions about how communal living can be utilised by different demographics to achieve a new type of social interaction, and a basic level of affordability that will resonate in the current context. The final design case study was critically reflected upon in terms of a theoretical client that over time might transition through three demographic groups – a working young person or couple, a family and a retired person or couple. In this way the design case study produced was considered as a flexible and long-term dwelling, resulting in a humane and appealing home for occupants at different stages of life...|$|R
40|$|Harmony search (HS) {{algorithm}} is an emerging population-based metaheuristic algorithm, which {{is inspired by}} the music improvisation process. The HS method has been developed rapidly and applied widely during the past decade. In this paper, an improved global harmony search algorithm, named harmony search based on teaching-learning (HSTL), is presented for high dimension complex optimization problems. In HSTL algorithm, four strategies (harmony memory consideration, teaching-learning strategy, local pitch adjusting, and random mutation) are employed to maintain the proper balance between convergence and population diversity, and dynamic strategy is adopted to change the parameters. The proposed HSTL {{algorithm is}} investigated and compared with three other state-of-the-art HS optimization algorithms. Furthermore, to demonstrate the robustness and convergence, the success rate and convergence analysis is also studied.
