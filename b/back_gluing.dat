5000|$|From 1953 to 1955, the Dallas Mapsco {{was made}} with a <b>glued</b> <b>back</b> {{in order to save}} costs on {{production}}. These first few years also saw the production of Mapsco's first product outside of Dallas, and it was not Fort Worth, but much more distant Houston, where Mapsco again became the first company to make an indexed city street atlas. Unfortunately, the endeavor ended poorly when the <b>glued</b> <b>backs</b> disintegrated in the very humid air of that city, and Mapsco has not produced a Houston map since.|$|R
5000|$|The role of Maureen {{was written}} {{specifically}} for 17-year-old Debbie Reynolds, and {{was her first}} speaking role in a film. Director David Butler advised her to avoid [...] "acting", and just say the lines the way she would say them herself. Another problem for Reynolds was physical: Because her ears stuck out from her head, {{they had to be}} <b>glued</b> <b>back,</b> but the <b>glue</b> had a tendency to come undone under the hot lights. Reynold's mother eventually solved the problem by having her daughter's ears pinned back surgically.|$|R

50|$|Iron-on fabric has a <b>glue</b> <b>backing</b> that melts {{into another}} fabric it {{is applied to}} with heat. It is used in {{patching}} torn clothes or to apply extra fabric in places subject to extreme wear. An alternative to iron on adhesive is dryer heat activated adhesive.|$|R
5000|$|... (a) : If we {{remove a}} {{cylinder}} from the 2-sphere, {{we are left}} with two disks. We have to <b>glue</b> <b>back</b> in - that is, two disks - and it's clear that the result of doing so is to give us two disjoint spheres. (Fig. 2a) ...|$|R
25|$|If M is {{a closed}} 2-manifold, new orbifold {{structures}} {{can be defined}} on Mi by removing finitely many disjoint closed discs from M and <b>gluing</b> <b>back</b> copies of discs D/ Γi where D is the closed unit disc and Γi is a finite cyclic group of rotations. This generalises Poincaré's construction.|$|R

50|$|Commercial label removal kits apply a strong, {{transparent}} sticker {{over the}} label surface. The {{goal is to}} carefully pull off the sticker and literally tear the front design of the label away from the <b>glued</b> <b>back.</b> In practice, {{varying degrees of success}} are encountered and extensive damage to the label can occur.|$|R

50|$|The spiral didgeridoo is {{also known}} {{variously}} as a spiral didge, spiralidoo, didgehorn or snail didgeridoo. Its spiral shape makes it more like a natural horn, and instruments are monotonal in C, C#, D, E, and F. The construction method includes splitting the wood, carving, and <b>gluing</b> <b>back</b> together to form the basic instrument.|$|R
5|$|In July 1984, Raiford guards {{found two}} hacksaw blades hidden in Bundy's cell. A steel bar {{in one of}} its windows had been sawed {{completely}} through at the top and bottom and <b>glued</b> <b>back</b> in place with a homemade soap-based adhesive. Several months later his cell was changed again after guards found an unauthorized mirror hidden in it.|$|R
6000|$|Monteith {{followed}} her up {{a step or}} two. She turned and waved him <b>back.</b> He stood <b>glued</b> to the ground, that weird sense of the supernatural once more overcoming him. For some seconds he watched her without speaking a word. Then at last he broke out. [...] "What {{are you going to}} do, Frida?" [...] he asked, almost anxiously.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{technique}} starts by cutting the main {{shape of the}} box. Then a 1/8" [...] to 1/4" [...] piece of wood is cut off what is to become the back. The drawer shape is cut within the main shape, which involves cutting through the main body, and the body must be <b>glued</b> <b>back</b> together. Once the drawer shape is cut, the usual technique is to remove 1/8" [...] to 1/4" [...] of material from both {{the front and rear}} of the drawer shape to be used as faces. The remaining stock is then reduced or hollowed out to produce a drawer or cavity. The front and rear drawer faces are <b>glued</b> <b>back</b> to the remaining hollowed drawer stock, and the back that was cut off is glued to the main body. A handle can be added {{to the front of the}} drawer if desired.|$|R
50|$|The film ends happily {{with the}} red and blue gnomes finally coming {{together}} to celebrate their newfound peace. Tybalt is revealed to still be alive having been <b>glued</b> <b>back</b> together, Featherstone is reunited with his wife after Benny finds and orders her online, Gnomeo and Juliet are married on a purple lawnmower, which symbolizes the new union of both gnome clans.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s a {{workshop}} for the serial manufacture of diatonically tuned Kharkiv banduras {{was established by}} Leonid Haydamka in Kharkiv and later another by Paliyivetz in Poltava. As a result, most players from Kharkiv and Poltava played on Kharkiv-style instruments. Modifications in the construction were gradually introduced such as <b>glued</b> <b>backs,</b> a mechanism for the rapid retuning of the instrument and a dampening mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The {{novel is}} one of Coupland's more popular. In its initial {{publication}} run, it was printed in two halves, <b>glued</b> <b>back</b> to back, so that one cover was upside down. The reader was forced, halfway through the novel, to turn the book upside down to continue reading. This quirk was eliminated on subsequent print runs, but the cover still retained this peculiar arrangement in some later printings.|$|R

(b): Having cut out two disks [...] we <b>glue</b> <b>back</b> in the {{cylinder}} [...] Interestingly, {{there are two}} possible outcomes, depending on whether our glueing maps have the same or opposite orientation on the two boundary circles. If the orientations are the same (Fig. 2b), the resulting manifold is the torus [...] {{but if they are}} different, we obtain the Klein bottle (Fig. 2c).|$|R
50|$|Reinforcing {{rock with}} glue {{is the most}} widely {{accepted}} modification to natural features in the sport climbing world. When a popular route is climbed over and over, holds may become looser and closer to breaking. Sometimes, these holds will be reinforced {{to prevent them from}} breaking. Other times, if a hold entirely breaks off, it may be <b>glued</b> <b>back</b> on. In most areas, these practices are considered acceptable if done neatly.|$|R
50|$|Sometime after nylon-backed {{neoprene}} appeared, {{the blind}} stitch method was developed. A blindstitch sewing machine uses a curved needle, {{which does not}} {{go all the way}} through the neoprene but just shallowly dips in behind the fabric <b>backing,</b> crosses the <b>glue</b> line, and emerges from the surface on the same side of the neoprene. This is similar to the overlock stitching used for teeshirts and other garments made from knitted fabrics.|$|R
2500|$|... (b) S0 × D2: Having cut out two disks S0 × D2, we <b>glue</b> <b>back</b> in the {{cylinder}} S1 × D1. Interestingly, {{there are two}} possible outcomes, depending on whether our gluing maps have the same or opposite orientation on the two boundary circles. If the orientations are the same (Fig. 2b), the resulting manifold is the torus S1 × S1, {{but if they are}} different, we obtain the Klein Bottle (Fig. 2c).|$|R
50|$|The {{body of the}} lute guitar {{is similar}} to the rounded body of the {{traditional}} lute. Several ribs (or panels) of curved wood (usually maple or rosewood) make up the <b>back</b> of body, <b>glued</b> to a wooden frame underneath. These ribs are sometimes painted to resemble the traditional (or stereotypical) perception of a medieval minstrel or jester. For example, ribs may be painted in alternating colors (e.g. white, green, white and so on).|$|R
5000|$|... (b) S0 × D2: Having cut out two disks S0 × D2, we <b>glue</b> <b>back</b> in the {{cylinder}} S1 × D1. Interestingly, {{there are two}} possible outcomes, depending on whether our gluing maps have the same or opposite orientation on the two boundary circles. If the orientations are the same (Fig. 2b), the resulting manifold is the torus S1 × S1, {{but if they are}} different, we obtain the Klein Bottle (Fig. 2c).|$|R
50|$|Unlike other velvet worms, Eoperipatus totoro has uniquely shaped {{hairs on}} its body surface. The body length {{is up to}} 2.5 inches (6 cm). These worms {{spend most of their}} lives inside moist soil, in rotting logs or under rocks. They come out only during rainy season, and therefore, are not easily seen. They can spit out jets of sticky glue, by which they capture small prey for food. They eject a net of glue from two {{appendages}} on their <b>back.</b> The <b>glue</b> is composed of a mixture of proteins in which prey can be entangled. Diagnostic features include distinct types of scales on the ventral side of the body, the inner structure of the circular pits on the male genital pad, and the position and size of the anal gland pads in males.|$|R
50|$|Hot fix rhinestones, {{also called}} heat {{transfer}} rhinestones, are mainly used for apparel. The flat {{bottom of the}} stone has a <b>glue</b> <b>backing</b> and when heated melts {{onto the surface of}} the clothing. These can be adhered using a regular iron, however, it is recommended to use a heat press, as they are able to reach higher temperatures (standard transfers require temperatures of up to 350 - 400 F, which regular irons are not capable of) while applying heavy pressures resulting in a more professional standard quality.|$|R
5000|$|Kadonaga's {{earliest}} {{works that}} gained him international attention {{were made with}} a veneer slicer to cut cedar logs with the bark removed into long strips the thickness of paper. The strips were then <b>glued</b> <b>back</b> together {{in the form of}} the original log. As well as slicing logs, Kadonaga has also carved geometric shapes, and split logs to reveal the grain. Wood is Kadonaga’s most extensively used material, which he uses to “explore different ways of looking at a tree, not to take a tree for granted” (...) ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1993 Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia named {{a second}} species, Cearadactylus ligabuei. The {{specific}} name honours Giancarlo Ligabue, {{the director of}} the Centro Sudi Ricerche Ligabue in Venice. It is based on holotype CCSRL 12692/12713, again a heavily damaged crestless skull, 403 millimetres long. The skull consists of two pieces, the front and the <b>back</b> part, <b>glued</b> together by fossil traders; it is uncertain whether they belong to the same individual or indeed to the same species. Dalla Vecchia was himself not convinced the new species in fact belonged to Cearadactylus, but the skull was not sufficiently unique to base its own genus on yet still too different from known species to be assigned to them, so he created a new species for the genus the fossil most resembled. Later authors have consistently denied the identity referring to the taxon as [...] "Cearadactylus" [...] ligabuei.|$|R
50|$|Further damage {{occurred}} during disassembly. The commissioned stonemason used percussion drills {{to get the}} iron pins out that held {{the pieces of the}} granite together. In doing so, large pieces at the respective ends of the drums were broken off. The drilling holes {{at each end of the}} drums show this clearly. The journey to Berlin was did not go smoothly either. The statue of Frederick William I from Great Stresow broke off at the legs. The head came off and was <b>glued</b> <b>back</b> by the master stonemason.|$|R
50|$|The Abkharza is a two-string musical {{instrument}} which {{is played by}} a bow. It {{is thought to have}} spread through Georgia from the region of Abkhazia. Mostly the Abkharza is used as an accompaniment instrument. There are performed one, two or three part songs and national heroic poems on it. Abkharza is cut out of a whole wood piece and has a shape of a boat. Its overall length is 480mm. its upper board is <b>glued</b> <b>back</b> to the main part. On the end it has two tuners.|$|R
50|$|The {{intuitive}} {{criterion of}} stretching, bending, cutting and <b>gluing</b> <b>back</b> together takes {{a certain amount}} of practice to apply correctly - it may not be obvious from the description above that deforming a line segment to a point is impermissible, for instance. It is thus important to realize that it is the formal definition given above that counts. In this case, for example, the line segment possesses infinitely many points, and therefore cannot be put into a bijection with a set containing only a finite number of points, including a single point.|$|R
5000|$|In 1975, the United States Postal Service {{issued a}} {{commemorative}} stamp honoring Haym Salomon for {{his contributions to}} the cause of the American Revolution. This stamp, like others in the [...] "Contributors to the Cause" [...] series, was printed on the front and the <b>back.</b> On the <b>glue</b> side of the stamp, the following words were printed in pale green ink: [...] "Financial Hero - Businessman and broker Haym Salomon was responsible for raising most of the money needed to finance the American Revolution and later to save the new nation from collapse".|$|R
5000|$|Early Dover {{books were}} noted for their quality. On {{the back of}} these paperbacks, Dover wrote:We have {{made every effort to}} make this the best book possible. Our paper is opaque with minimal show-through; it will not discolor or become brittle with age. Pages are sewn in signatures, in the method {{traditionally}} used for the best books and will not drop out as so often happens with paper <b>backs</b> held with <b>glue.</b> Books open flat for easy reference. The binding will not crack or split. This is a permanent book.|$|R
5000|$|Originally the rod {{was simply}} a bamboo/cane rod, which was cut and treated, but unlike {{contemporary}} western bamboo rods, they were not [...] "manufactured" [...] (i.e. split and <b>glued</b> <b>back</b> together). Unlike in the western fly-fishing tradition where anglers used heavy wooden rods, in Japan anglers always used bamboo, which is readily available and very light. Because of its light weight, Japanese anglers {{were able to use}} very long bamboo rods and reach as far as needed without the need to develop reels for the short rods developed in the west.|$|R
