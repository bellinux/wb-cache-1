5|$|Bramantyo {{attempted}} to make his film as historically accurate as possible. However, as no documentation of Dahlan's life <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Mecca exists, the scenes showing Dahlan's youth were fictionalized. The script underwent 12 revisions before the film was completed. Much of the film's budget of Rp. 12 billion (US$ 1.3 million) was spent on costumes and sets to ensure accuracy. The crew restored several old buildings for their shots and custom-ordered 19th-century style traditional garments for their scenes.|$|E
5|$|Green {{told police}} that she had one or two drinks after dinner and went to her bedroom, leaving it only to speak to Tim in the kitchen some time between ten and eleven in the evening, shortly <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed. Kelly and Kate {{had gone to bed}} earlier, each taking one of the family's two dogs with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar {{were in the process of}} divorce, though she did not know how far along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} Sylvester Q. Cannon and Rudger Clawson created two {{vacancies}} in the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in mid-1943. On July 8, 1943, Kimball received {{a telephone call}} from J. Reuben Clark, the first counselor to church president Heber J. Grant, notifying him that he had been called to fill one of the vacancies. Kimball was initially so shocked by the call that he asked Clark's permission to ponder it for several days <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Salt Lake City to meet with him in person, as part of a previously-scheduled family trip. After the phone call, Kimball's desire to accept the calling was overwhelmed by feelings of self-doubt and incompetence. His wife, Camilla, recounted that although her husband was not prone to tears, he afterward lay on the floor of their home and wept uncontrollably as she tried to comfort him. After an intense emotional and spiritual struggle, Kimball had an unusual dream, which gave him peace on his ability to accept the calling. He was ordained an apostle by Grant and added to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the Salt Lake Temple on October 7, 1943. Grant had chosen Ezra Taft Benson to fill the other vacancy in the Quorum, and he and Kimball were ordained on the same day. As he was four years older than Benson, Kimball was ordained first, which put him ahead of Benson in the Quorum's seniority.|$|E

25|$|Lazarus Saturday commemorates Jesus' {{raising of}} Lazarus from the dead, just <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Jerusalem himself. The main themes {{anticipate}} the Resurrection of Jesus, showing him as master over death. On this day wine and oil are allowed (and, in the Russian tradition, caviar), lightening the fast by one degree. Palm Sunday {{is considered one}} of the Great Feasts of the Lord, and is celebrated with fish, wine and oil, the lightest degree of fasting, in observance of the festival. Because it is a Great Feast of the Lord, the normal resurrectional elements of the Sunday services are omitted. However, some of these resurrectional elements are found in the Lazarus Saturday service.|$|E

25|$|Constantius's {{activities}} in Britain were remembered in medieval Welsh legend, which frequently confused his family {{with that of}} Magnus Maximus, who also {{was said to have}} wed a Saint Elen and sired a son named Constantine while in Britain. Henry of Huntingdon's History of the English identified Constantius's wife Helen as British and Geoffrey of Monmouth repeated the claim in his 1136 History of the Kings of Britain. Geoffrey related that Constantius was sent to Britain by the Senate after Asclepiodotus (here a British king) was overthrown by Coel of Colchester. Coel submitted to Constantius and agreed to pay tribute to Rome, but died only eight days later. Constantius married his daughter Helena and became king of Britain. He and Helena had a son, Constantine, who succeeded to the throne of Britain when his father died at York eleven years later. These accounts have no historical validity: Constantius had divorced Helena <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Britain.|$|E
25|$|A more {{thorough}} reform of handwriting than the Petrarchan compromise {{was in the}} offing. The generator of the new style (illustration) was Poggio Bracciolini, a tireless pursuer of ancient manuscripts, who developed the new humanist script {{in the first decade}} of the 15th century. The Florentine bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci recalled later in the century that Poggio had been a very fine calligrapher of lettera antica and had transcribed texts to support himselfâ€” presumably, as Martin Davies points outâ€” <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Rome in 1403 to begin his career in the papal curia. Berthold Ullman identifies the watershed moment in the development of the new humanistic hand as the youthful Poggio's transcription of Cicero's Epistles to Atticus. By the time the Medici library was catalogued in 1418, almost half the manuscripts were noted as in the lettera antica. The new script was embraced and developed by the Florentine humanists and educators NiccolÃ² de' Niccoli and Coluccio Salutati.|$|E
