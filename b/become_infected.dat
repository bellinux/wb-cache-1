5|$|Many viruses, {{including}} HIV {{which needs}} CD4 and CXCR4, need a receptor to attach to and enter into host cells. The host prion, PrPc {{may be a}} receptor protein for an as yet undiscovered TSE virus, explaining why animals lacking host prion do not <b>become</b> <b>infected</b> with experimental prion disease.|$|E
5|$|Markinson gives Gabe {{a report}} on the virus called Syphon Filter, a {{bioweapon}} that one can program on a genetic level to target specific groups of people. Markinson orders Gabe to infiltrate Rhoemer's stronghold in Ukraine to inject test subjects with a vaccine and locate Phagan, who is now Rhoemer's prisoner. In the catacombs, Phagan tells Gabe that Lian is alive, and they reunite. Lian has <b>become</b> <b>infected</b> with Syphon Filter, and she says there is no universal cure.|$|E

5|$|Children {{are less}} likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who <b>become</b> <b>infected</b> as adults or older {{children}} will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E

5|$|Given with {{chloroquine}} or quinine, clindamycin {{is effective}} and well tolerated in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, {{and is the}} treatment of choice for pregnant women who <b>become</b> <b>infected</b> in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. Clindamycin {{should not be used}} as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing.|$|E
5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can <b>become</b> <b>infected.</b> The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{notably the}} Australian {{paralysis}} tick, are also intrinsically venomous {{and can cause}} tick paralysis. Eggs can <b>become</b> <b>infected</b> with pathogens inside a female tick's ovaries, {{in which case the}} larval ticks are infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host. Tropical bont ticks transmit the rickettsial disease heartwater which can be particularly devastating in cattle. The ticks carried by migratory birds may act as reservoirs and vectors of infectious diseases. Over twenty strains of pathogenic virus were found in the autumn in the Egyptian migratory bird study.|$|E

5|$|The prepatellar bursa and the {{olecranon}} bursa {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to <b>become</b> <b>infected,</b> or septic. Septic bursitis typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection to be caused by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. It is highly unusual for septic bursitis to be caused by anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection can be caused by tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has <b>become</b> <b>infected.</b> In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Sylvester's boyfriend, Rick Cranmer, {{became aware}} that he had <b>become</b> <b>infected</b> with HIV; with no known medical cure, his health {{deteriorated}} rapidly and he died in September 1987. Sylvester was devastated, and although recognizing that he too was probably infected, he refused to have his blood tested, only noticing the virus's first symptoms when he developed a persistent cough. Beginning work on an album that would remain unfinished, he {{moved into a new}} apartment on Collingwood Street in the Castro, and tried his best to continue performing in the Bay Area, even though he became too sick to undertake a full tour. Eventually diagnosed with AIDS, he was hospitalized for sinus surgery in late 1987, and upon returning to his apartment he began to be cared for by his mother and Tracy, before being hospitalized again in May 1988, this time with pneumocystis pneumonia. Returning to his flat, he gave away many of his treasured possessions and wrote his will.|$|E

5|$|Sometime after Lochry's Defeat, Brant and Simon Girty {{got into}} an altercation along the Ohio River. According to {{contemporary}} gossip, Girty took exception to Brant's boasting about {{the success of the}} expedition, perhaps because Girty believed his brother George deserved more credit. The two men, who were reportedly drunk, came to blows, which ended when Brant slashed Girty in the head with his sword. The wound, which took several months to heal, left a scar on Girty's forehead. When Brant returned to Detroit in October, he had a sword cut on his leg, which had <b>become</b> <b>infected</b> and initially looked as if it would result in amputation. The wound was officially reported as accidentally self-inflicted, although gossipers said that it {{was the result of the}} fight with Girty. Brant's Iroquois companions returned home, but Brant was compelled to stay in Detroit over the winter in order to recover.|$|E
5|$|The fugitives {{arrive at}} Elizabeth's house, where she tends to Steve, {{in the late}} stages of his infection. One of Steve's pustules erupts in her face, killing him and infecting Elizabeth. At that moment, Mulder and the Marshals raid the house and arrest her, but find Paul missing. Meanwhile, Scully traces Torrance's package to Pinck Pharmaceuticals, a major drug developer. She also finds an insect {{in the body of}} another prisoner. Dr. Osbourne, who has <b>become</b> <b>infected,</b> reveals that his team works for Pinck and are researching a dilating enzyme {{produced}} by the insect. However, the insect has a parasitic life cycle that kills its hosts. Osbourne claims that the insect and its contagion were deliberately introduced into the prison by Pinck as an experiment. He tells Scully that since she was next to him when he became infected, she may have contracted the contagion as well.|$|E
