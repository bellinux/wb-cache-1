These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E

Subaqueous eruptions represent only 8 % of all recorded eruptions but have produced about 20 % of all fatalities associated with volcanic activity in historical time.

Subaqueous eruptions have produced lahars primarily on high (. 1000 m), steep-sided volcanoes containing small (, 1 km diameter) crater lakes.

In this study, we focus on phreatic eruptions, defined by Barberi et al. (1992), as the eruption style caused by underground aquifers, {{whether or not they are}} phreatic or geothermal, without direct involvement of a magma body. Although most phreatic eruptions are local phenomena affecting a limited area, they can be accompanied by hazards such as ballistic blocks, <b>base</b> <b>surges,</b> and debris avalanches, and precursors are often subtle (Barberi et al. 1992). Germanovich and Lowell (1995) suggested a typical sequence of processes for phreatic eruptions: (1) dike injection, (2) hydrothermal system heating above the dike, and (3) rapid crack propagation due to thermal stress. This implies that the hydrothermal system may experience some change in state prior to phreatic eruptions. However, changes in the hydrothermal system do not always lead to explosive surface manifestations. Thus, improved understanding of changes in state in the hydrothermal system contributes to the assessment of whether phreatic eruption is likely.|$|R

Our model, whose results are consistent with the literature, is a simple tool for defining the conditions at conduit exit that control the most hazardous volcanic regimes. Besides the well-known convective plume regime, which generates pyroclastic fallout, and the vertically collapsing column regime, which leads to pyroclastic flows, we introduce an additional regime of radially expanding columns, which form when the eruptive gas-particle mixture exits from the vent at overpressure with respect to atmosphere.

40|$|The {{products}} of basaltic hydrovolcanism (maars, tuff rings, tuff cones) are {{second only to}} scoria cones as the most abundant volcanic landforms on Earth (Cas and Wright, 1988, p. 376). However, the origin of these deposits remains poorly understood. This project integrates both volcanology and sedimentology to study Sinker Butte, an erosional remnant {{of a very large}} basaltic tuff cone located at the southern edge of the western Snake River Plain. Subaerial and subaqueous deposits from this center are well exposed {{on both sides of the}} Snake River Canyon, creating an unusual opportunity to study the entire eruptive sequence. The deposits at Sinker Butte were studied by measuring 23 detailed stratigraphic sections from 20 to 100 m thick proximal to distal from the vent. Prior to the eruption the bottom of Lake Idaho was fairly uniform and flat with small topographic highs in the northern areas, and had a depth of 15 - 20 m. The lake gradually deepened to the south to a depth of 60 - 70 m. The magma once in contact with the lake water fragmented, causing violent explosions through the lake bed. Explosive pulses dominated this eruption, with each explosion ejecting more material out of the vent. This material included gas, liquid water, accidental clasts, and small juvenile cinders. This created a broad, asymmetrical platform of tuff that began growing around the vent towards the surface of the lake. The lowest units are generally massive, poorly sorted deposits. As the platform grew towards the surface of the lake the deposits grade into better sorted sediments with large scale cross-stratification. The primary depositional mechanism at this time was subaqueous density flows. The transition from the subaqueous to subaerial deposits is marked by an abrupt sharp contact into well-bedded palagonite and accretionary lapilli tuffs. The planar, laterally continuous beds suggest deposition by airfall. Present proximal to the vent are large regressive cross-strata, which suggest deposition by wet <b>base</b> <b>surges.</b> Sections intermediate and distal from the crater rim contain well-bedded tuffs with interbeds of fine cross-stratification.
