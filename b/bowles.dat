5|$|In 1766 John Egerton, Bishop of Bangor, {{appointed}} {{an elderly}} English priest, Dr Thomas <b>Bowles,</b> to the parish of St Beuno, Trefdraeth and its chapelry of St Cwyfan, Llangwyfan. Between them the parish and chapelry had about 500 parishioners, of whom all but five spoke only Welsh, whereas <b>Bowles</b> spoke only English. The parishioners and churchwardens of Trefdraeth petitioned against Bowles's appointment, {{arguing that the}} appointment of a priest who did not speak Welsh breached the Articles of Religion, the Act for the Translation of the Scriptures into Welsh 1563 and the Act of Uniformity 1662. In 1773 the Court of Arches ruled that only clergy who could speak Welsh should be appointed to Welsh-speaking parishes, and <b>Bowles</b> should not have been appointed, but he now held the ecclesiastical freehold of the benefice and the case to deprive him of it had not been proved. The court therefore let <b>Bowles</b> stay in post, which he did until he died in November of that year. <b>Bowles</b> was then replaced in the parish and chapelry with Richard Griffith, a priest who spoke Welsh.|$|E

5|$|San Martín {{requested}} {{help from}} British Admiral William <b>Bowles.</b> He wrote from Chile {{and expected to}} find him in Buenos Aires, but <b>Bowles</b> had embarked for Río de Janeiro. <b>Bowles</b> considered that San Martín was more trustworthy than Alvear, and praised his monarchism.

He returned to Chile; his wife Remedios stayed in Buenos Aires with her daughter Mercedes because of her health problems. Unable to get help from either Buenos Aires or foreign powers, San Martín promoted a more decisive commitment from Chile to finance the navy.|$|E

(These six volumes as found in libraries today are bound into 2, 3, 4, or 6 volumes.) The whole work is written in Spanish, a language which <b>Bowle</b> did not master. Its reception was unfavourable, except in Spain, where it was praised by :es:Juan Antonio Pellicer, among others. In 1784 <b>Bowle</b> complained in The Gentleman's Magazine, in four pseudonymously-signed letters, and in 1785 he published Remarks on the Extraordinary Conduct of the Knight of the Ten Stars and his Italian Squire, {{to the editor of}} Don Quixote. In a letter to J. S., D.D. The pamphlet and letters were directed against Joseph Baretti, who retorted in a scathing, bitter book, entitled Tolondron, Speeches to John <b>Bowle</b> about his Edition of Don Quixote, 1786. Today, <b>Bowle's</b> edition is considered the first scholarly edition of the work, and was reproduced in facsimile in 2006. <b>Bowle</b> was the first to consider Don Quixote as a classic author, by which he meant [...] "on the level of ancient Greek and Latin authors", and like them, in need of a scholarly, annotated edition.|$|R
