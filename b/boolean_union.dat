A polyhedral model that precisely approximates the part shape is given as input, and the offset shape of the model is obtained as the <b>Boolean</b> <b>union</b> of the expanded shapes of all surface triangles.

In general, for a mechanical part, it can be constructed from a base geometry and then incrementally add or cut other basic constructive elements. During a conceptual design process, designers work through this basic form construction process with freehand drawing, a construction sketch can be received progressively with principal and construction lines. This construction sketch contains information about a valid construction process with related elements, which in turn can support CSG-based solid modeling. The construction sketch can be partitioned into several feature drawing; each feature drawing can be topologically represented a feature graph, and easily recognized as a projection of a corresponding 3 D constructive element. While the relationship between two feature graphs gives information to construction methods such as add (<b>Boolean</b> <b>Union)</b> or cut (Boolean Subtraction). From these information, reconstructing a valid 3 D object from an construction sketch can be achieved interactively, realizing the “What You Draw is What You Get” design fashion without pre-defined gestures.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{contribution}} to the algebraic theory of recognizable languages, {{in the spirit of the}} work of Eilenberg and Schutzenberger. Eilenberg's variety theorem gives a bijective correspondence between varieties of languages and varieties of finite semigroups or finite monoids. Varieties of languages are classes of recognizable languages closed under finite boolean operations, inverse morphisms and left and right quotients. Much effort has been devoted in recent years to extend this correspondence to operations. That is, given an operation on languages, find the associated operation on the semigroup level, or conversely, given an operation on (finite) semigroups, find the associated operation on the languages level. The most important operations on languages are the <b>boolean</b> operations (<b>union,</b> intersection and complement), the concatenation product and Kleene's star operation.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{interactive}} method of model clipping for computer-assisted surgical planning. The model is {{separated by a}} data filter that {{is defined by the}} implicit function of the clipping path. Being interactive to surgeons, the clipping path that is composed of the plane widgets can be manually repositioned along the desirable presurgical path, which means that surgeons can produce any accurate shape of the clipped model. The implicit function is acquired through a recursive algorithm based on the Boolean combinations (including <b>Boolean</b> <b>union</b> and Boolean intersection) of a series of plane widgets' implicit functions. The algorithm is evaluated as highly efficient because the best time performance of the algorithm is linear, which applies to most of the cases in the computer-assisted surgical planning. Based on the above stated algorithm, a user-friendly module named SmartModelClip is developed on the basis of Slicer platform and VTK. A number of arbitrary clipping paths have been tested.

40|$|A 3 -D world {{modeling}} technique using range data is discribed. Range data {{quantify the}} distances from the sensor focal plane {{to the object}} surface, i. e., the 3 -D coordinates of discrete points on the object surface are known. The approach proposed herein for 3 -D world modeling {{is based on the}} Combinatorial Geometry (CG) method which is widely used in Monte Carlo particle transport calculations. First, each measured point on the object surface is surrounded by a small sphere with a radius determined by the range to that point. Then, the 3 -D shapes of the visible surfaces are obtained by taking the (<b>Boolean)</b> <b>union</b> of all the spheres. The result is an unambiguous representation of the object's boundary surfaces. The pre-learned partial knowledge of the environment can be also represented using the CG Method with a relatively small amount of data. Using the CG type of representation, distances in desired directions to boundary surfaces of various objects are efficiently calculated. This feature is particularly useful for continuously verifying the world model against the data provided by a range finder, and for integrating range data from successive locations of the robot during motion. The efficiency of the proposed approach is illustrated by simulations of a spherical robot in a 3 -D room in the presence of moving obstacles and inadequate prelearned partial knowledge of the environment...|$|E

Acceptance of {{a run for}} an infinite input word can be defined using traditional acceptance criteria for ω-automata, such as Büchi, Rabin or Streett conditions.

In this paper, we study a series of fundamental properties of probabilistic ω-automata with three different language-semantics: (1) the probable semantics that requires positive acceptance prob-ability, (2) the almost-sure semantics that requires acceptance with probability 1, and (3) the threshold semantics that relies on an additional parameter λ ∈] 0, 1 [that specifies a lower probability bound for the acceptance probability.

40|$|Conserved genetic {{programs}} often predate the homologous {{structures and}} phenotypes {{to which they}} give rise; eyes, for example, have evolved several dozen times, but their development seems to involve {{a common set of}} conserved genes. Recently, the concept of orthologous phenotypes (or phenologs) offered a quantitative way to describe this property. Phenologs are phenotypes or diseases from separate species who share an unexpect-edly large set of their associated gene orthologs. It has been shown that the phenotype pairs which make up a phenolog are mutually predictive in terms of the genes involved. Recently, we demonstrated the ranking of gene–phenotype association predictions using multiple phenologs from an array of species. In this work, we demonstrate a computational method which provides a more targeted view of the conserved pathways which give rise to diseases. Our approach involves the generation of synthetic pseudo-phenotypes made up of <b>Boolean</b> combinations (<b>union,</b> intersection, and difference) of the gene sets for phenotypes from our database. We search for diseases that overlap significantly with these Boolean phenotypes, and find a number of highly predictive combinations. While set unions pro-duce less specific predictions (as expected), intersection and difference-based combinations appear to offer insights into extremely specific aspects of target diseases.
