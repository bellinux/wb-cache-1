5|$|Comminges {{was called}} up to the Guadeloupe team, ahead of the 2007 Gold Cup. The 2007 edition of the tournament {{was the first time}} the country had participated in the competition. He made his debut in Guadeloupe's opening game of the tournament, playing the whole match in a 1–1 draw with Haiti. He went on to play in one of the two {{remaining}} group matches; starting in a surprise 2–1 victory over group winners Canada, before missing a 1–0 defeat to Costa Rica through suspension. Finishing the group in third place with four points, Guadeloupe qualified as one of the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> third-place finishers. Comminges subsequently started in the quarter-final match, as Guadeloupe defeated Honduras 2–1. Comminges earned his fourth cap in the semi-final, as his country narrowly lost to Mexico by a 1–0 scoreline.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Canada {{hosted the}} first Canada Cup series. Perreault played with future Hockey Hall of Fame members such as Bobby Orr, Darryl Sittler, Bobby Hull, Guy Lafleur and Marcel Dionne. Perreault often {{played on a}} line with fellow Québécois Lafleur and Dionne. Canada won the series after beating Czechoslovakia in a <b>best</b> <b>two</b> out of three. He later played in the 1981 Canada Cup on a line with Wayne Gretzky and Lafleur. He was playing {{some of the best}} hockey of his career, leading all scorers with nine points in four games, when he was forced out of the tournament with a broken ankle. Canada lost the final to the USSR 81. Perreault was named to the All Tournament Team, despite playing in only four of Canada's seven games.|$|E
5|$|On November 20, 2016, with {{forwards}} Paul George, C. J. Miles and Kevin Seraphin sidelined, Robinson {{started and}} posted a double double with 16 points and 11 rebounds in an overtime win against the Oklahoma City Thunder. He got his second {{start of the}} season on November 25 and finished with a team high and career-high 20 points and five rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets. Those two starts were regarded as the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> performances of his career up to that date. Robinson returned to the starting lineup when Monta Ellis was injured in mid-December. He posted a season-high rebounding performance in a 12-point, 12-rebound double double against the Detroit Pistons in his fourth start in his return to the starting lineup. During the 2017 All-Star Weekend, Robinson became the first Pacers player since Fred Jones (in 2004) to win the Slam Dunk Contest. On March 24 with less than 3 weeks left in the regular season, Robinson was sidelined for at least two weeks with a calf strain. After missing the final 11 games of the regular season, Robinson was sidelined for {{the first game of the}} 2017 NBA Playoffs on April 15 against Cleveland, but he returned to the lineup for game 2 on April 17.|$|E

5|$|The HP.80 and Avro's Type 698 {{were chosen}} as the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> of the {{proposed}} designs to B.35/46, and orders for two prototypes of each were placed. It was recognised, however, {{that there were many}} unknowns associated with both designs, and an order was also placed for Vickers' design, which became the Valiant. Although not fully meeting the requirements of the specification, the Valiant design posed little risk of failure and could therefore reach service earlier. The HP.80's crescent wing was tested on a ⅓-scale glider, the HP.87, and a heavily modified Supermarine Attacker, which was given the Handley Page HP.88 designation. The HP.88 crashed on 26 August 1951 after completing only about thirty flights and little useful data was gained during its brief two months of existence. By the time the HP.88 was ready, the HP.80 wing had changed such that the former was no longer representative. The design of the HP.80 had sufficiently advanced that the loss of the HP.88 had little effect on the programme.|$|E

This tournament established Steinitz and Zukertort as the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> players in the world, {{and led to the}} inaugural World Championship match between these two, the World Chess Championship 1886. This match, won by Steinitz, though not held under the aegis of any official body, is generally recognized as the first official World Chess Championship match, with Steinitz the game's first official World Champion.|$|E
25|$|While {{the events}} were the same, since the 1992 Games {{there was a}} rule change so that instead of jumping three times and taking the points for the <b>best</b> <b>two,</b> the {{competitors}} only jumped twice. In the individual normal hill/15 km, Japan's Kenji Ogiwara had only lost a single event in the season's World Cup, but came in sixth on the hill, which was won by Norway's Fred Børre Lundberg. He won the event after finishing eight-best in the skiing, ahead of Japan's Takanori Kono, Norway's Bjarte Engen Vik and Ogiwara in fourth. In the team normal hill/3 x 10 km, Japan finished first, third and fifth among the jumpers, giving them a 5:07 minute lead over Norway and finishing 4:49 minutes ahead.

Following the match Rush took a microphone and berated both El Terrible and the fans for their actions that night and then followed it up by challenging El Terrible to a Luchas de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match at a later date.

25|$|The fifth {{match of}} the evening {{centered}} around the ongoing promotional push behind the new Místico, who replaced the Original Místico. On the night La Nueva Era Místico teamed up with Atlantis and La Mascara for a <b>Best</b> <b>two</b> out of three falls Six-man tag team match against the team of Los Guerreros del Infierno (Dragón Rojo Jr., Euforia and Último Guerrero). A second storyline, unrelated {{to the introduction of}} La Nuevo Era Místico focused on the internal problems of Los Guerreros del Infierno, building on Guerrero and Dragón Rojo Jr. losing the CMLL World Tag Team Championship to Atlantis and Diamante Azul the previous week. During the match Guerrero and Dragón Rojo Jr. would often argue and not work as a unit. In the end Místico incapacitated Último Guerrero while Atlantis pinned Euforia to win the match. After the match Guerrero and Dragón Rojo Jr. got into an argument that turned into a shoving match, but never went beyond that.|$|E

Again they would face Italian opposition, Juventus, who had won, unbeaten, the 1983–84 Cup Winners' Cup. Juventus had a team comprising many of Italy's 1982 FIFA World Cup winning team–who played for Juventus for many years–and their playmaker Michel Platini was considered the best footballer in Europe, being named Footballer of The Year by France Football magazine {{for the second year in}} a row in December 1984. Both teams were placed in the two first positions in the UEFA club ranking at the end of the last season and were regarded by the specialist press as the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> sides on the continent at the time.

25|$|The 2011 Slovenian Supercup was {{the seventh}} {{edition of the}} Slovenian Supercup, an annual {{football}} match contested by {{the winners of the}} previous season's Slovenian PrvaLiga and Slovenian Cup competitions. The match was played on 8 July 2011, in Ljudski vrt stadium between 2010–11 Slovenian PrvaLiga winners Maribor and 2010–11 Slovenian Cup winners Domžale. Both teams contested for their second Supercup title. The match was played by the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> teams of the 2010–11 season. During the course of that season Maribor was a league champion with Domžale being the only serious contender through most of the season, eventually finishing as runners up. The two teams were the only ones in the league that earned 20 or more victories, with Maribor achieving 21 and Domžale 20. In addition, both teams were part of the Slovenian cup final, held on Stožice stadium in Ljubljana and won by Domžale with the score 4–3 after regulation. The match is arguably one of the best cup finals ever held, since the competition was first introduced during the 1991–92 season.|$|E
25|$|Lampard was pivotal in the semi-finals of the 2011–12 Champions League {{against the}} heavily favoured {{defending}} champions Barcelona. Bookmakers had Barcelona on the shortest odds {{to win a}} second consecutive Champions League title, and various commentators opined that Chelsea would have to produce their <b>best</b> <b>two</b> {{games of the season}} – and hope that Barca played their worst two – to upset the Catalan giants. In the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Lampard stripped Lionel Messi off the ball then played a cross-field pass to Ramires, who set up Drogba for the only goal of the game, giving Chelsea a 1–0 advantage. In the second leg at the Camp Nou, Lampard assumed the captaincy after Terry was sent off early in the game. Down 2–0 to Barça just before half-time, Lampard assisted Ramires' goal with a through-pass which levelled the aggregate score at 2–2 while putting Chelsea ahead on away goals. Chelsea teammate Fernando Torres added another goal in stoppage time to give Chelsea a 3–2 victory overall and produce one of the greatest upsets in the history of European football. This set up Chelsea's match with Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena for the Champions League final.|$|E
25|$|The first tournaments of the Australasian Championships {{suffered}} from the competition of the other Australasian tournaments. Before 1905, all Australian states and New Zealand had their own championships, the first organised in 1880 in Melbourne and called the Championship of the Colony of Victoria (later the Championship of Victoria). In those years, the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> players– Australian Norman Brookes (whose name is now written on the men's singles cup) and New Zealander Anthony Wilding– almost did not play this tournament. Brookes came once and won in 1911, and Wilding entered and won the competition twice (1906 and 1909). Their meetings in the Victorian Championships (or at Wimbledon) helped {{to determine the best}} Australasian players. Even when the Australasian Championships were held in Hastings, New Zealand, in 1912, Wilding, though three times Wimbledon champion, did not come back to his home country. It was a recurring problem for all players of the era. Brookes went to Europe only three times, where he reached the Wimbledon Challenge Round once and then won Wimbledon twice. Thus, many players had never played the Austral(as)ian amateur or open championships: the Doherty brothers, William Larned, Maurice McLoughlin, Beals Wright, Bill Johnston, Bill Tilden, René Lacoste, Henri Cochet, Bobby Riggs, Jack Kramer, Ted Schroeder, Pancho Gonzales, Budge Patty, and others, while Brookes, Ellsworth Vines, Jaroslav Drobný, came just once. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, when travel was less difficult, leading players such as Manuel Santana, Jan Kodeš, Manuel Orantes, Ilie Năstase (who only came once, when 35 years old) and Björn Borg came rarely or not at all.|$|E

25|$|The Bowl Championship Series, {{famous for}} its use of math, was the {{successor}} of the Bowl Alliance (1995–1997), which was itself the successor of the Bowl Coalition (1992–1994). Besides the many adjustments it underwent during its tenure, including a large overhaul following the 2004 season that included {{the replacement of the}} AP Poll with the Harris poll, the BCS remained a mixture of math and human polls since its inception in 1998, with the goal of matching the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> teams in the nation in a national championship bowl game which rotated yearly between the Sugar, Fiesta, Rose, and Orange Bowls from 1998 to 2005, and later a standalone game titled the BCS National Championship Game (2006 to 2013). The winner of the BCS Championship Game was awarded the national championship of the Coaches' Poll thus winning the AFCA National Championship Trophy. The BCS winner also received the MacArthur Bowl from the National Football Foundation. Neither the AP Poll, nor other current selectors, had contractual obligations to select the BCS champion as their national champion. The BCS resulted in a number of controversies, most notably after the 2003 season, when the BCS championship game did not include eventual AP champion USC, the only time the two championships have diverged since the advent of the BCS. After many seasons of controversy, the BCS was replaced with the College Football Playoff, a Plus-One system aimed at reducing the controversy involved in which teams get to play in a championship game through use of a tournament.|$|E
25|$|Caesar responded quickly. He force-marched six legions {{north to}} Orléans, where the {{rebellion}} had begun, {{and then to}} Gergovia, the home of Vercingetorix. At the same time, he sent his deputy Titus Labienus with four legions to subdue the Parisii and their allies, the Senons. The Commander of the Parisii, Camulogene, burned the bridge that connected the oppidum to the left bank of the Seine, so the Romans were unable to approach the town. Then Labienus and the Romans went downstream, built their own pontoon bridge at Melun and approached Lutetia on the right bank. Camulogene responded by burning the bridge to the right bank and burning the town on the Île de la Cité, before retreating to the left bank and making camp at what is now Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Labienus deceived the Parisii with a clever ruse; {{in the middle of}} the night, he sent part of his army, making as much noise as possible, upstream to Melun, left his most inexperienced soldiers in their camp on the right bank, and, with his best soldiers, quietly crossed the Seine to the left bank and laid a trap for the Parisii. Camulogene, believing that the Romans were retreating, divided his own forces, some to capture the Roman camp, which he thought was abandoned, and others to pursue the Roman army. Instead, he ran directly into the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> Roman legions on the plain of Grenelle, near the site of the modern Eiffel Tower and the École Militaire. The Parisii fought bravely and desperately in what became known as the Battle of Lutetia; Camulogene was killed and his soldiers were cut down by the disciplined Romans. Despite the defeat, the Parisii continued to resist the Romans; they sent eight thousand men to fight with Vercingetorix in his last stand against the Romans at the Battle of Alesia.|$|E
