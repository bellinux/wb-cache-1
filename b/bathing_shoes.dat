She was clad, not in the single white silk slip she evidently wore only for girl parties, but in a coquettish imitation of the prevailing fashion mode, a suit of changeable light blue and green silk--almost the color of the pool; the skirt slightly above the knees whose roundedness he recognized; with long stockings to match, and tiny <b>bathing</b> <b>shoes</b> bound on with crossed ribbons. On her head was a jaunty swimming cap no jauntier than herself when she urged the ten minutes in place of five.|$|E

Although he {{admitted}} having hijacked the aircraft, but denied criminal liability because of was {{under the influence of}} evil powers. He made is statement in Arabic with an interpreter. He stated that he had been forcefully recruited to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, where he had been brainwashed.

In 1858, Whitman published a 47,000 word series called Manly Health and Training under the pen name Mose Velsor. Apparently he drew the name Velsor from Van Velsor, his mother's family name. This self-help guide recommends beards, nude sunbathing, comfortable <b>shoes,</b> <b>bathing</b> daily in cold water, eating meat almost exclusively, plenty of fresh air, and getting up early each morning. Present-day writers have called Manly Health and Training [...] "quirky", [...] "so over the top", [...] "a pseudoscientific tract", and [...] "wacky".|$|R

In many communities, mirrors in the mourners' home are covered since {{they should not be}} concerned about their personal appearance. It is customary for the mourners to sit on low stools or even the floor, symbolic of the emotional reality of being [...] "brought low" [...] by the grief. The meal of consolation (seudat havra'ah), the first meal eaten on returning from the funeral, traditionally consists of hard-boiled eggs and other round or oblong foods. This is often credited to the Biblical story of Jacob purchasing the birthright from Esau with stewed lentils (Genesis 25:34); it is traditionally stated that Jacob was cooking the lentils soon {{after the death of his}} grandfather Abraham. During this seven-day period, family and friends come to visit or call on the mourners to comfort them ("shiva calls").|$|R
