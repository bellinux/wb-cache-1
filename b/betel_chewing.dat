Water is brought to the houses by little aqueducts formed of large Bamboos split in half and supported on crossed sticks of various heights so as {{to give it a}} regular fall. Thin long-jointed Bamboos form the Dyaks' only water-vessels, and a dozen of them stand in the corner of every house. They are clean, light, and easily carried, and are in many ways superior to earthen vessels for the same purpose. They also make excellent cooking utensils; vegetables and rice can be boiled in them to perfection, and they are often used when travelling. Salted fruit or fish, sugar, vinegar, and honey are preserved in them instead of in jars or bottles. In a small Bamboo case, prettily carved and ornamented, the Dyak carries his sirih and lime for <b>betel</b> <b>chewing,</b> and his little long-bladed knife has a Bamboo sheath. His favourite pipe is a huge hubble-bubble, which he will construct in a few minutes by inserting a small piece of Bamboo for a bowl obliquely into a large cylinder about six inches from the bottom containing water, through which the smoke passes to a long slender Bamboo tube. There are many other small matters for which Bamboo is daily used, but enough has now been mentioned to show its value. In other parts of the Archipelago I have myself seen it applied to many new uses, and it is probable that my limited means of observation did not make me acquainted with one-half the ways in which it is serviceable to the Dyaks of Sarawak.|$|E

The history of <b>betel</b> nut <b>chewing</b> in Southern China indexes {{the ways in which}} non-Han minorities were sinicized, demonstrating how <b>betel</b> nut <b>chewing</b> culture was appropriated by Han nobles, and variously incorporated into Han cultural expressions in the southern region.; In Taiwan <b>betel</b> nut <b>chewing</b> marks boundaries between groups in terms of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and gender. The stigmatization of betel nut in Taiwan is explained by political, economic, and historical factors related to the Japanese colonial prohibition and KMT neglect of the betel nut industry. Ethnic, gender and socioeconomic status was articulated by a re-introduced commoditized practice of <b>betel</b> nut <b>chewing.</b> Marketing strategies involving "betel nut beauties" developed in the betel nut retailing business, since most betel nut chewers were men. The industry functioned as a "shadow economy. " The symbolic nature of betel nut among the "Indigenous <b>betel</b> nut <b>chewing</b> cultures" of southeastern Taiwan articulates themes of cultural prosperity and wealth. Tourism development is based on cultivating Indigenous cultural capital.; In Hainan <b>betel</b> nut <b>chewing</b> marks boundaries between locals and outsiders.

Interethnic relations among Han and non-Han are marked by salient cultural differences, though all share a <b>betel</b> nut <b>chewing</b> culture. The use of betel nut in weddings shows continued social and symbolic significance. Betel nut production and retailing remains integrated in the traditional economy.

Analysis of the symbolic nature of betel nut and the process of chewing is found to relate to gendered complementary practice at its root, and extends to various expressions of betel nut in its social and ritual forms.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Betel</b> quid, <b>chewed</b> {{by about}} 600 million people worldwide, {{is one of}} the most widely used {{addictive}} substances. Cessation factors in betel quid chewers are unknown. The present study explores prevalence and the quit rate of <b>betel</b> quid <b>chewing</b> in Taiwan aborigines. Our goal was to delineate potential predictors of chewing cessation. Methods A stratified random community-based survey was designed for the entire aborigines communities in Taiwan. A total of 7144 participants were included between June 2003 and May 2004 in this study. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, such as gender, age, obesity, education years, marital status, ethnicity, and habits of <b>betel</b> quid <b>chewing,</b> smoking and drinking was collected by trained interviewers. Results The prevalence of betel quid chewers was 46. 1 %. <b>Betel</b> quid <b>chewing</b> was closely associated with obesity (OR = 1. 61; 95 % CI: 1. 40 – 1. 85). Betel quid chewers were most likely to use alcohol and cigarettes together. Quit rate of betel quid chewers was 7. 6 %. Betel quid chewers who did not drink alcohol were more likely to quit (OR = 1. 89; 95 % CI: 1. 43 – 2. 50). Alcohol use is a significant factor related to cessation of <b>betel</b> quid <b>chewing,</b> but smoking is not.

Of a total of 229 women recruited into this study, 32 women with adverse birth outcomes constituted the case group. Analyses revealed that adverse birth outcomes were associated with maternal <b>betel</b> quid <b>chewing</b> and maternal age. After adjusting for maternal age, the risk of adverse birth outcome was five times higher among <b>betel</b> quid <b>chewing</b> women as compared to substance nonusers.

Although factors related to <b>betel</b> quid <b>chewing</b> or cessation of behaviors were reported previously, few studies simultaneously compared both behaviors in the same population. In addition, {{it is essential to}} consider time-to-event concept, since the chance of developing or stopping habit may vary over time. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the risk factors for commencement and cessation of <b>betel</b> quid <b>chewing</b> behaviors in a time-to-event setting. Methods A stratified multi-stage cluster sampling with selection probabilities proportional to size (PPS) was designed for Taiwanese adults with aged 18 years old and above. Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to compare and calculate the hazard rate ratios for related factors to commencement or cessation of chewing habits. Results In Taiwan, men had a higher <b>betel</b> quid <b>chewing</b> rate (M: 20. 9 %, W: 1. 2 %), but woman chewers had a lower cessation rate (M: 27. 5 %, W: 12. 7 %). The hazard rate ratio (HRR) of having chewing habit changed from 4. 22 (men vs women) univariately to 1. 38 multivariablely, which indicated gender differences were confounded by other factors. In multivariable analysis, the risk factors of gender, education and ethnicity were significantly associated with both starting and cessation of <b>betel</b> quid <b>chewing</b> behavior.

AURKA, which encodes a centrosome-related serine/threonine kinase, is frequently amplified and overexpressed in many human cancers, particularly advanced OSCC. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study to estimate AURKA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and environmental risk factors to determine OSCC susceptibility and clinicopathological characteristics. We enrolled a total of 876 OSCC patients and 1200 controls. Four SNPs of AURKA, namely rs 1047972, rs 2273535, rs 2064863, and rs 6024836, were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among the 1420 smokers, the AURKA polymorphism carriers with the <b>betel</b> nut <b>chewing</b> habit had a higher risk of oral cancer than AURKA wild-type (WT) carriers without the <b>betel</b> nut <b>chewing</b> habit. Patients with the AURKA rs 2064863 gene had a 1. 365 -fold higher risk of stage III or IV OSCC (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 029 - 1. 811) than those with the rs 2064863 WT gene. Furthermore, carriers of the AURKA rs 1047972 /rs 2273535 /rs 2064863 C-A-T haplotype had a 1. 736 -fold (95 % CI 1. 110 - 2. 715) higher risk of OSCC than controls (C-T-T, the most common haplotype). Among patients with the <b>betel</b> quid <b>chewing</b> habit, carriers of other haplotypes (C-T-T, C-A-G, T-A-T, T-A-G, T-T-T, and C-T-G) had a 12. 857 -fold (95 % CI 10. 731 - 15. 404) increased risk, and carriers of the C-A-T haplotype had the highest risk (AOR: 31. 120; 95 % CI 13. 864 - 69. 850) of OSCC, compared with those without the <b>betel</b> quid <b>chewing</b> who harbored other haplotypes. In conclusion, <b>betel</b> nut <b>chewing</b> combined with the AURKA C-A-T haplotypes lead to a high risk of OSCC. These findings reveal a novel genetic-environmental predisposition for oral tumorigenesis...|$|R
