The aim was to clarify the de-mand relationships among the major coffee varieties traded internationally and the factors influencing coHee prices by variety. A nine-equation model of the U. S. coHee market was constructed, consisting of import-demand, export-supply, and stock-demand functions describing the structural mecha-nisms underlying the market {{for each of the}} three coffee varieties. Estimates of structural parameters were obtained by different estimation methods, but only three-stage least-squares results are reported in this article. Parameter estimates suggest that milds (the premium coHee variety) are normal eco-nomic goods, whereas <b>brazils</b> <b>and</b> robustas are inferior goods with respect to the U. S. economy.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this project}} is to explore <b>Brazil's</b> <b>and</b> China's {{positions}} in the international society in terms of 'the Responsibility to Protect' (R 2 P). We use the English School as our theoretical framework, especially utilising the concepts of pluralism and solidarism in the debate on sovereignty and non-interference vs. human rights transcending sovereignty, respectively as the guiding principles of international society. Great power status and international responsibility, are also key concepts employed throughout the project, which is discussed from a historical perspective, in terms of <b>Brazil's</b> <b>and</b> China's roles as emerging powers. We argue how <b>Brazil’s</b> <b>and</b> China’s relationships with R 2 P have evolved from being embedded in a rigid pluralistic understanding of the international society, to paying closer attention to solidaristic understandings of the international society such as R 2 P. This culminated in their formulation of Brazil's Responsibility while Protecting and China's Responsible Protection, which {{show that they are}} actively engaging with R 2 P, and acknowledge that R 2 P does {{have a role to play}} in guiding the international society. This is despite the fact that both states voiced a condemnatory critique of the 2011 Libyan intervention. Finally, through a comparative analysis of <b>Brazil's</b> <b>and</b> China's foreign policies and their relationship with R 2 P we will discuss how both countries have evolved as responsible actors in the international society. We conclude that both states have moved significantly on the pluralism-solidarism continuum, towards accepting and adopting more solidaristic foreign policies...|$|R
