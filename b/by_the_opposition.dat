5|$|A motion passed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> parties (161 for to 115 against) on February 5, 2007 {{to reaffirm}} Canada's {{commitment}} to the Kyoto Protocol.

5|$|However, {{some of his}} Twitter posts proved {{controversial}} and were highlighted negatively <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> and press. As Minister of State for External Affairs he re-established long-dormant diplomatic relationships with African nations, where his fluency in French made him popular with Francophone countries and their heads of state.|$|E

50|$|The first {{gathering}} of <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> Communists {{was held in}} Berlin March 17-19, 1930. It was attended <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>oppositions</b> of Germany, Czechoslovakia, Sweden and by M. N. Roy. The meeting decided {{to set up an}} information center in Berlin to co-ordinate international activities and publish a bulletin, International Information of <b>the</b> Communist <b>Opposition,</b> which had previously been published <b>by</b> <b>the</b> KPO.|$|R
5|$|In April 1974, {{faced with}} {{attempts}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Opposition</b> to obstruct supply (appropriation bills) in the Senate, Whitlam obtained the concurrence of the Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, to a double dissolution. Labor was returned at the election on 18 May with a reduced House majority of five seats. The Coalition and Labor each had 29 Senate seats, with {{the balance of}} power held by two independents.|$|E
5|$|At the time, several princes {{complained that}} they were being betrayed by Britain, who they {{regarded}} as an ally, and Sir Conrad Corfield resigned his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten {{played a crucial role in}} ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the {{attention}} was placed on the weather forecast and the prospects of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially if the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.|$|E

5|$|Following the incident, the {{government}} offered dialogue which the opposition {{said they will}} only take part in after {{the withdrawal of the}} army. The general labor union called for a general strike. Internationally, the attack on protesters was condemned by Barack Obama and Human Rights Watch. High Representative of European Union expressed her deep concerns and called for restrain and immediate dialogue. Britain revoked over forty arms licenses to Bahrain after an earlier announcement that it would review them and German president canceled a planned visit to the country. Buhmaid is remembered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> as a martyr, leader and symbol of peacefulness.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the country}} {{held its first}} {{parliamentary}} elections; however, two years later, the late emir dissolved the parliament and suspended the constitution after parliament rejected the State Security Law. The period between 2002 and 2010 saw three parliamentary elections. The first, held in 2002 was boycotted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition,</b> Al Wefaq, which won {{a majority in the}} second in 2006 and third in 2010. The 2011 by-election was held to replace 18 members of Al Wefaq who resigned in protest against government crackdown.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, al-Jamri was {{released}} {{along with other}} opposition activists. The new emir, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, proposed a reform plan, the National Action Charter of Bahrain, which was accepted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> and later gained widespread popular support. A year later, Hamad issued a new constitution which al-Jamri said fell short of the opposition's demands.

5|$|In late 2003, it was {{discovered}} that Texan businessman Allen Stanford had given both Joseph and fellow minister Gaston Browne cheques worth 100,000 East Caribbean dollars. While Browne denied suggestions that this had constituted bribery, claiming that the money had gone towards community projects, Leader of the Opposition Baldwin Spencer demanded that both ministers resign. Both ministers were part of a team negotiating with Stanford over a land exchange in St. John's, and the news led to protesters picketing their offices. Prime Minister Lester Bird affirmed his support in both ministers, and despite a motion of censure brought <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> and more protests, Stanford publicly made a second set of donations to Joseph and Browne.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 2013, Dunderdale held a {{surprise}} cabinet shuffle that saw Minister Marshall shuffled out of Finance and appointed as Minister of Natural Resources. He {{was replaced by}} Jerome Kennedy, who had served as Natural Resources Minister since October 2011. With contract negotiations underway with public sector unions Minister Kennedy's appointment was called a warning shot to the union leaders <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition.</b> Minister Kennedy is considered a tough negotiator, and was Minister of Finance in 2008 during the last round of contract negotiations.|$|E
5|$|The Jamaican general {{election}} scheduled for August 27 was postponed until September 3, {{at which point}} they went ahead as planned. Opponents accused Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller of unnecessarily extending {{the state of emergency}} (and related curfews) to maintain her political control as predictions at the time suggested that she and her party would be ousted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition.</b> She and her party ultimately did lose the election, although Dean's light damage was not thought to have been a major factor.|$|E

5|$|The governor's {{relationship}} with the General Assembly has typically been the determining factor in his success at enacting his agenda, although other factors also play an important role. In most of Indiana's history, the governor has come to power {{at a time in}} which his party controlled the assembly. Since the political parties first became dominant in 1831 and until 2010, thirty-three sessions of the legislature have been divided with different parties controlling the House and Senate. Only five sessions have occurred where the legislature was entirely controlled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> party, while in ninety-eight sessions the governor's party controlled the entire assembly.|$|E
5|$|The {{war began}} with the Libyan {{occupation}} of northern Chad in 1983, when Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi, refusing to recognize {{the legitimacy of the}} Chadian President Hissène Habré, militarily supported the attempt <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) to overthrow Habré. The plan was foiled by the intervention of France which, first with Operation Manta and later with Operation Epervier, limited Libyan expansion to north of the 16th parallel, in the most arid and sparsely inhabited part of Chad.|$|E
5|$|Bohun's {{spent most}} of his early career reconquering Marcher lands {{captured}} by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd during the Welsh war in England. This was finally accomplished through Edward I's war in Wales in 1277. Hereford also fought in Wales in 128283 and 129495. At the same time he also had private feuds with other Marcher lords, and his conflict with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, eventually ended with the personal intervention of King Edward himself. Hereford's final years were marked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> he and Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, mounted against the military and fiscal policy of Edward I. The conflict escalated to a point where civil war threatened, but was resolved when the war effort turned towards Scotland. The king signed the Confirmatio Cartaruma confirmation of Magna Cartaand Bohun and Bigod agreed to serve on the Falkirk Campaign. Bohun died in 1298, and was succeeded by his son, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the signing}} of Lee Vaughan {{in the summer of}} 2010, Courtney's {{position}} at Kidderminster looked tenuous and the club stalled on a new contract as they were finalising their budget for the forthcoming season. He joined Kidderminster's Conference Premier rivals York City on 24 May 2010 on a one-year contract. He made his debut in a 2–1 defeat to former club Kidderminster as a 76th-minute substitute on 14 August 2010, the opening day of 2010–11, and he conceded a penalty kick in the 89th minute that was scored <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition.</b> His first start for the club came in a 1–1 draw at Wrexham on 11 September 2010. Having made seven appearances for York, Courtney was made available for loan on 28 October 2010. He went on trial with League Two club Cheltenham Town in January 2011, who were managed by Yates, Courtney's manager at Kidderminster. He impressed playing in central defence in Cheltenham's reserve match against Coventry City. Courtney was released by York after his contract was cancelled on 21 January 2011, after which he agreed to train with Cheltenham for one week. However, Cheltenham decided to not offer him a contract.|$|E
5|$|Howe's {{impatience with}} the {{necessity}} for parliamentary debate of his proposals won him few friends, and he was often accused of dictatorial conduct <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Opposition.</b> As the Liberal government entered its third decade, it and Howe {{came to be seen}} as arrogant. The Government's attempt to impose closure in the 1956 Pipeline Debate led to major controversy in the House of Commons. In the 1957 election, Howe's actions and policies were made an issue by Opposition leader John Diefenbaker. Howe faced a serious challenge in his riding, but was expected to make speeches elsewhere as a major Liberal leader. Howe lost his seat in the election, and Diefenbaker became Prime Minister, ending almost 22years of Liberal rule. Howe returned to the private sector, accepting a number of corporate directorships. The former minister died suddenly {{of a heart attack in}} December 1960.|$|E
5|$|In 1576, the Transylvanian prince Stefan Batory became King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania after a contested {{election}} to the joint Polish–Lithuanian throne with the Habsburg Emperor Maximilian II. Both Batory's fiancèe Anna Jagiellon and Maximilian II had been proclaimed elected to the same throne in December 1575, three days apart; Maximilan's death in October 1576 prevented the conflict from escalating. Batory, ambitious to expel Ivan IV from Livonia, was constrained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> of Danzig (Gdansk), which resisted Batory's accession with Danish support. The ensuing Danzig War of 1577 ended when Batory conceded further autonomous rights to the city {{in return for a}} payment of 200,000 zloty. For a further 200,000 zloty payment, he appointed Hohenzollern George Frederick as administrator of Prussia and secured the latter's military support in the planned campaign against Russia.|$|E
