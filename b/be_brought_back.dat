Moreno was forced to put in at Rockland, Maine—where many of the observers on board were left to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> by train to Camden—before proceeding for repairs to the Fore River Shipyard, which had built the ship's engines.|$|E
5|$|Alkan's {{compositions}} for organ {{have been}} among the last of his works to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to the repertoire. As to Alkan's pedal-piano works, due to a recent revival of the instrument, they are once again being performed as originally intended (rather than on an organ), such as by Italian pedal-pianist Roberto Prosseda, and recordings of Alkan on the pedal piano have been made by Jean Dubé and Olivier Latry.|$|E
5|$|The US Immigration and Naturalization Service {{allowed her}} body to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to the United States. She was buried in German Waldheim Cemetery (now named Forest Home Cemetery) in Forest Park, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago, among the graves of other labor and social activists {{including}} Ben Reitman and those executed after the Haymarket affair. The bas relief on her grave marker was created by sculptor Jo Davidson.|$|E

5|$|The Germans placed {{candles on}} their {{trenches}} and on Christmas trees, then continued the celebration by singing Christmas carols. The British responded by singing carols of their own. The two sides continued by shouting Christmas greetings to each other. Soon thereafter, there were excursions across No Man's Land, where small gifts were exchanged, such as food, tobacco and alcohol, and souvenirs such as buttons and hats. The artillery {{in the region}} fell silent. The truce also allowed a breathing spell where recently killed soldiers could <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> behind their lines by burial parties. Joint services were held. In many sectors, the truce lasted through Christmas night, continuing until New Year's Day in others.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{response}} {{was so good}} that in September 1914 {{the decision was made}} to raise the 4th Infantry Brigade and 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades. The 4th Infantry Brigade was commanded by Colonel John Monash, a prominent Melbourne civil engineer and businessman. The AIF continued to grow through the war, eventually numbering five infantry divisions, two mounted divisions and a mixture of other units. A sixth infantry division, the 6th Division, was partially formed in the United Kingdom February 1917. Casualties from the First Battle of Bullecourt and the Battle of Messines caused the disbandment of the partially formed unit to allow the other five divisions to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> up to strength.|$|E
5|$|Vicksburg's fall gave Union forces {{control of}} the Mississippi River and split the Confederacy. By that time, Grant's {{political}} sympathies fully coincided with the Radical Republicans' aggressive prosecution {{of the war and}} emancipation of the slaves. The success at Vicksburg was a morale boost for the Union war effort. The personal rivalry between McClernand and Grant continued after Vicksburg until Grant removed McClernand from command when he contravened Grant by publishing an order without permission. When Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton suggested Grant <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> east to run the Army of the Potomac, Grant demurred, writing that he knew the geography and resources of the West better and {{he did not want to}} upset the chain of command in the East.|$|E

5|$|The {{project has}} been criticised for its delayed {{completion}} date; in 2009 the Department for Transport confirmed that Network Rail was developing High Level Output Specification options for the station, with an estimated date for the re-opening of the platforms of 2014, seven years after their closure. The cost of maintaining the disused platforms up to late 2010 was found via a Freedom of Information request to have been £4.1million. South West Trains subsequently confirmed that platform 20 would <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> into use in 2014, hosting certain services to and from Reading, Windsor, Staines and Hounslow. These would be 10-car trains newly formed from refurbished SWT and former Gatwick Express rolling stock. Platform 20 reopened in May, with access via platform 19, and platforms 21 and 22 in October after steps were constructed over the former Eurostar entrance to access the platforms.|$|E
5|$|Urobuchi {{stated that}} Sayaka was his {{favorite}} character overall, and remarked that her plotline was the most enjoyable to write. Due to her grim fate {{by the end of}} the series, a destiny that Shinbo believed was slightly unfair, he asked Urobuchi if it was possible to change the plot so that Sayaka could be spared. Urobuchi declined, asserting that her death was too integral to the overarching story. Shinbo then inquired if there were any way that she could <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to life, admitting he had become very attached to the character. However, Urobuchi again refused, explaining that this would be impossible with regard to the already-established rules governing the story. Shinbo finally acquiesced to this, but remarked that he believed there may have been too large of a burden placed on the characters who were in essence young middle school girls.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} monument, the Tour of Flanders, BMC was noted to be {{bringing}} a strong squad, headed by Ballan and Hincapie. Burghardt and Van Avermaet {{went on the}} attack in the early portions of the race, only to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> after a short while. When Fabian Cancellara put in {{an attack on the}} Leberg, the day's fourteenth cobbled climb, and quickly took a sizable time gap, it was the BMC team which organized the chase to bring him back. They placed four riders into a seven-rider chase group and succeeded in bringing Cancellara back, something which has usually not happened to him in classics races. A further two riders had remained {{at the head of the}} peloton, giving them six riders at the front of the race when Cancellara was caught. Cancellara put in another move on the Muur van Geraardsbergen and was followed only by Sylvain Chavanel and eventual race winner Nick Nuyens. Hincapie finished with the group 5 seconds back for sixth place on the day. Kristoff rode to seventh place in the sprinters' classic Scheldeprijs later in April, back of three-time winner Mark Cavendish.|$|E

5|$|Hannibal was now {{isolated}} at {{the northern}} end of the British line, under heavy fire from Formidable as well as the Spanish shore batteries and gunboats and unable to manoeuvre or effectively respond. Ferris attempted to notify Saumarez of his ship's precarious position, but his signal halyards had been torn away by shot and it was sometime before assistance could be organised. The rest of the squadron was ordered to provide ship's boats to attempt to tow Hannibal off the shoal but the attempt failed, Caesars pinnace sinking in the process after being struck by a cannonball. Ultimately, Hannibal was left stranded as the last of the seabreeze disappeared, preventing any of the other British ships from coming to Ferris' assistance. There was however a light land breeze from the northwest that initially favoured the outnumbered and battered French squadron, Linois immediately ordering his ships to sever their anchor cables and use the breeze to manoeuvre slowly into stronger defensive positions closer inshore. His flagship Formidable successfully completed the manoeuvre, but neither Indomptable nor Desaix could <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> under control in time, and both grounded, Desaix directly in front of Algeciras and Indomptable northeast of Isla Verda with her bow facing out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Snake {{continues}} his mission, destroying the facility and the Shagohod tank, while engaging Volgin, who is {{killed by a}} bolt of lightning during the battle. Snake and EVA travel to a lake, where a WIG ground effect vehicle is hidden. Before they use it to escape the region, Snake confronts his old mentor, The Boss, whom he must assassinate to complete his mission. After an emotional battle, The Boss gives Snake the microfilm containing the location of the Philosopher's Legacy, and requests Snake to kill her. Soon after, Snake overcomes his feelings and kills The Boss, emerging victorious. He and EVA escape to Alaska, and spend the night together as they make love. During the night, EVA disappears with the microfilm, and leaves behind a tape revealing herself to be a Chinese spy sent to steal the Philosopher's Legacy for China. The tape continues, and EVA reveals that The Boss did not defect to the Soviet Union; rather, she was under orders to pretend to defect so she could infiltrate Volgin's ranks and find the location of the Legacy, which could <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to America. The final part of her mission was to sacrifice her honor and die at the hands of Snake, under the guise of a traitor, to prove the U.S.'s innocence in Volgin's nuclear attack during the Virtuous Mission.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived at}} its final destination of Libreville on 21 March, after twenty-seven days. The {{block of ice}} was found to weigh 2,714kg; it had lost only 336kg along the way. Though it was unclear how much time the expedition would take, Klevan had initially estimated a loss of 10%; the end result was approximately 11%. A French representative of the company met the crew in Libreville. A personal friend of President Charles de Gaulle, he presented an offer to drive the ice back to Paris. If the crew accepted, the President himself would have received the crew under the Arc de Triomphe. The men, however, were too exhausted at that point to contemplate such an offer. Instead, arrangement were made for the vehicles to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> by freight, while the crew would fly home. The ice was cut up and divided between the citizens of Libreville, for whom this was a rare commodity. Klevan, always conscious of promotional opportunities, brought {{a portion of the}} ice back home with him. This ice was subsequently used in drinks served to journalists at the première of the expedition documentary back home in Oslo.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fictional version of the Shibuya {{shopping}} district in Tokyo, Japan. While everyday life goes on in the Realground (RG), the chosen dead are brought to an alternate plane of existence called the Underground (UG). The UG is also the venue for the Reapers' Game. By offering their most treasured possession to enter the Game, the dead gain the chance to contest for the prize: to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to life or to transcend to a higher form of spiritual existence. Most of those who choose to transcend become Reapers, the opponents of players in future Games. Lasting a week, each Game is a contest to judge the worth of humanity. Players set out to accomplish objectives under the rules created by the Composer, who is a god-like entity who maintains Shibuya. Another Reaper, the Conductor, tasks other Reapers to obstruct the players' efforts. Failure to complete a mission will disperse the mind and spirit of the player or Reaper, thus erasing his or her existence.|$|E

25|$|By mid-July an {{armistice}} {{came into}} effect and the 21st Brigade subsequently undertook garrison duties along the coast. In December 1941 Imperial Japanese forces advanced rapidly in South East Asia following {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor and the invasion of Malaya. As a result, in January 1942, the British government requested that the 7th Division <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> from the Middle East to conduct operations in the Netherlands East Indies. From 30 January, the division, including the 21st Brigade, began disembarking from Suez. In February 1942, however, as {{the situation in the}} Pacific worsened, the Australian government decided that the division should <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to Australia rather than be committed to the fighting in Java, or in Burma.|$|E
