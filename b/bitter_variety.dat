Both cultivars were infested throughout {{the period of the}} observations, but significantly higher populations (P< 0. 01) occurred on the sweet variety Lueki while the <b>bitter</b> <b>variety</b> Mvuama harboured less scales. Three planting dates (early, intermediate and late planting) were considered to follow the changes in the populations of ARTS on these two varieties. ARTS population development on the plant showed the same trend for the three planting dates on both varieties. The peaks in the population occurred {{at the onset of the}} main dry season, in May in the plots of the intermediate planting and, in June in the early and late planted plots, indicating seasonal effects. The late planting date showed the highest peaks and higher infestations throughout (P< 0. 05). Dramatic drops in ARTS populations occurred just after the peaks, from 700 individuals to < 100 individuals for the highest peak. Instrinsic mortality increased with the increase in population densities. No evidence of predation was observed. In addition to natural mortality, larvae migration/dispersal occurred. Such high mortalities coupled with migration/dispersal were attributed to the over-population of the ARTS on the plants, indicating density effects. These observations show that cassava cultivars, cultivation season, dry season effects, natural mortality and migration are major factors influencing ARTS population abundance on cassava.

Of the lupin cultivars tested only those with strongly reduced alkaloid contents were acceptable as host plants by the generalist species of aphid tested, and only M. albifrons reproduced on the “bitter” cultivars. In order to define the performance of M. albifrons, developmental time, mean relative growth rate and number of embryos were recorded for two strains reared for several generations on a bitter cv. of lupin and then transferred for several generations to sweet lupin and then reared again on a bitter cv. of lupin. The performance of M. albifrons was not better on lupins rich in alkaloids. However, the results also indicate that this aphid can adapt and thrive on a previously resistant cultivar within five generations even when reproducing parthenogenetically and that this change is reversible...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cassava root meal {{which has}} been used as good {{alternative}} energy source in poultry and pig diets is increasingly becoming an important energy source for feeding the world’s human population. There are however, several by-products of cassava harvest ranging from the leaves, peels and pulp which have potential as feed ingredients in poultry rations. Cassava peels and pulps are moderate to high in energy and have been included in diets as replacements for conventional energy sources. Cassava leaves, moderate to good protein contents, have been used as protein supplements. Dietary recommendations of cassava by-products for poultry have varied considerably. The major factors limiting the efficient utilization of these by-products in poultry diets include the high fibre and low energy contents and likely presence of antinutritional factors, mainly hydrocyanic acid (HCN) in the <b>bitter</b> <b>variety</b> of cassava. Several technologies have been used to improve the utilization of cassava by-products by poultry. The following paper reviewed the composition of some cassava by-products (leaves, peels and pulp), their recommendations for inclusion in poultry diets and processing methods to maximize their utilization by poultry. It was concluded that efficient use of cassava by-products will reduce feed cost of poultry production and provide additional source of income to cassava farmers and processors...|$|E

The fermentation with peeled roots is preferred because it favours the rapid softening of cassava roots and it allows to shorten {{at least one day}} the fermentation duration.

40|$|In Mozambique 97 % of {{the small}} scale farmers grow cassava in 43 % of the total {{cultivated}} land. In 2012 cassava production was estimated at 10. 05 million tons. Cassava {{is the second most}} important staple food after maize. Consumption of cassava is estimated at 85 kg per person per year. In Mozambique the diet is poor in micronutrients and the prevalence of under-nutrition is estimated at 38 %. Anaemia is a serious public health concern, affecting more than 40 % of young children, pregnant and nursing mothers. Cassava mahewu a fermented nonalcoholic beverage prepared using indigenous traditional technology. Fermentation is known to reduce the toxicity of cyanogenic glycosides in both leaves and cassava roots. It also results in higher levels of vitamins, especially the B group, essential amino acids, improves the digestibility of protein and increases the bioavailability of minerals. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether cassava, in the form of mahewu, can be fortified with iron. Bitter and sweet cassava roots and soil samples, were collected from small scale farmers in four Districts of Mozambique. The four Districts are located in intermediate and high production areas of cassava. The concentrations of iron and other minerals such as aluminum, calcium, copper, manganese, phosphorus, lead and zinc in cassava roots and soil, were determined using an inductively coupled-plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), after microwave digestion. Sweet and bitter varieties of cassava from four Districts in Mozambique were fermented in a food laboratory, under controlled conditions (45 °C for 24 hours) and the optimal stage for iron fortification was determined. Samples were collected at hour 0 and hour 24 for microbial analysis, acid concentration and total solids determination. Fortification with ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) and ferrous fumarate (C 4 H 2 FeO 4) were investigated. The total iron content of the fortified cassava mahewu was determined using Microwave Digestion Accelerated Reaction System (MARS) and ICP-OES, while the bioaccessibility of iron in fortified cassava mahewu was assessed using the in vitro dialysability procedure. Results showed that the mineral content of soil from the four districts differed significantly (p ˂ 0. 05). There was also a significant difference (p ˂ 0. 05) in the mineral concentration of the cassava roots from the four varieties, but no difference between sweet or bitter types. The concentration of minerals was found to be significantly higher in soil, than in roots. This difference was greatest for iron concentration, which was not detectable in the root samples, although soil concentration was up to 24. 78 mg/kg. Although the reason for this was not determined, this lack of iron in the roots supported iron fortification of mahewu. A significant difference (p ˂ 0. 05) in pH was observed between mahewu fortified with ferrous sulfate (4. 5) and ferrous fumarate (4. 3), with the latter being similar to the control. At the beginning of fermentation the acidity was 0. 06 % and at the end 0. 30 %. The total solids of fermented mahewu were 9. 6 %. The microorganisms responsible for fermentation were predominantly lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeast. The pH and acidity was different to that reported in the fermentation of maize mahewu. The fermenting microorganisms and total solids were similar to previous findings for maize mahewu. The total iron content of mahewu fortified with ferrous sulfate was significantly higher (p ˂ 0. 05) than mahewu fortified with ferrous fumarate. Both the amount and percentage of bioaccessible iron were higher in mahewu fortified with ferrous sulfate compared to mahewu fortified with ferrous fumarate. It was found that mahewu made using the <b>bitter</b> <b>variety</b> of cassava and fortified with ferrous sulfate provided a more bioaccessible source of iron. The stage of fortification was not found to affect the total iron content nor the iron bioaccessibility. It was concluded that cassava roots do not take up iron, even when soils are high in this metal. Thus the selection of varieties with better uptake of minerals and fertilization of soils is recommended, but may not increase concentration of essential minerals sufficiently to maintain health in vulnerable communities where cassava is the main staple. This was the first study in which fermentation of traditional cassava mahewu was carried out under repeatable, controlled conditions. It is recommended that fortification occurs at the end of the fermentation when done at household level. However, when flour is being milled in larger villages, it could be fortified prior to sale in informal markets. There is also the possibility of large scale commercial applications. It is concluded that bitter varieties of cassava will deliver more bioaccessible iron to the consumer. Ferrous sulfate is more suitable as iron fortification source for cassava mahewu than ferrous fumarate and also is more stable in mahewu. Fortification of cassava mahewu could contribute to the iron intake of vulnerable population. In addition, although fortification at the end of fermentation would probably be ideal for rural communities, as it could be made available in sugar sprinkled into the traditional product, it was shown that fortification of flour used to make mahewu would result in significantly higher availability. It is recommended that iron fortification of mahewu is implemented both at subsistence and commercial level. This should form part of a communication strategy at community level by the state, in order to improve public health in vulnerable communities in Mozambique.

However, some <b>bitter</b> <b>varieties</b> of cassava contain high levels of hydrogen cyanide, a natural poison which can be very damaging to human health. Fortunately, the poison can be removed by careful processing, for example by cutting the cassava into small pieces and soaking it in water. Afterwards, the cassava can either be cooked and eaten, or else dried and stored. Farmers need to ensure that when the crop is drying, it is protected from sources of dirt, such as chickens, dogs or other animals. Using a raised drying rack {{can be a good}} method. And as Patrick Mphaka recently found out, farmers also need to protect their stored cassava from insects and moulds. He sent us this report. IN:		?Cassava is one of the root ? OUT:		? or the moulds, for future use. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 42 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Patrick Mphaka, speaking to Grinja Chitowe, an agricultural field assistant in Blantyre, Malawi. Transcript Mphaka	Cassava is one of the root and tuber crops which is of vital importance to the food security of over one billion people in developing countries including Malawi. However, not every tuber which is harvested is utilized. Some is lost to moulds and weevils, among other post harvest deterioration causes. The protection, storage, and processing are some of the steps that ought to be looked at in order to improve the amounts of the harvested crop for the actual consumption. I learnt some of the ways which can be used to preserve the crop when I talked to Mr. Grinja Chitowe, an agricultural field assistant in Blantyre. Chitowe	There are so many varieties which are grown in the rural areas. These are sweet and <b>bitter</b> <b>varieties.</b> When you want to process cassava, these sweet varieties, you make chips which we call Makaka in Chichewa. And for the <b>bitter</b> <b>varieties,</b> what is recommended is: when it has reached maturity stage, that is around 12 to 15 months, we uproot the cassava and then we submerge it in water for about a week to remove the bitterness. And, we make the chips and we heap them into a heap and then after about 24 hours we put the chips into the water, wash them, clean them, and dry them in the sun. After the chips are well dried, we apply the actellic super and store them in a cool dry place. The actellic is applied at the rate of 25 g of actellic super to a 50 kg bag of cassava chips. Mphaka	What is the purpose of cutting the cassava into small pieces which you are referring to as chips here? Chitowe	As you know, it needs the chips not to take long to dry. So, the purpose of slicing them is to fasten the drying process for it not even to grow the moulds. Mphaka	Would you like to explain a bit why most of the times we see that the cassava pieces which have been stored have got a lot of moulds, what happens? Chitowe	A lot of cassava gets moulds because of the weather pattern. When it is cloudy and the farmers have already made the makaka, they are not dry. If it takes long without any sunny days, sunny periods, it grows moulds. So, after the farmers have experienced these moulds, they have to wash those moulds in clean water, and then re-dry the cassava chips. Mphaka	Is there a difference in taste between the chips which are mouldy and one which is not? Chitowe	The taste is different, because when it grows mouldy, it is rotting. It tastes bad. But if the makaka is processed very well, dried very well, the taste is good. It is palatable. So it is proper to process the makaka or the cassava in a proper way. Mphaka	Surely you don?t use actellic to control the moulds, what do you use the actellic for? Chitowe	When you make makaka it can be attacked by the pests like the weevils. So, when the weevils attack cassava chips, it means it is destroying. So to control these weevils, we have to apply actellic super. Mphaka	Is there any traditional way, other than the use of actellic super? For example in the villages, what can people do? Chitowe	Sometime back, they were just keeping them in a smoking kitchen, but it was not helpful to the farmers because even the weevils were attacking while those bags are kept in a smoked area. Mphaka	What is your advice to farmers who grow, or are planning to grow cassava? Chitowe	We encourage farmers to grow the cassava as a security crop, as you know it needs less moisture. But we need farmers to process it properly because of the bitterness or the moulds, for future use. End of track. Grinja Chitowe, an agricultural field assistant from Blantyre, Malawi, describes how cassava is dried and stored, and a method for removing toxin from the <b>bitter</b> <b>varieties...</b>|$|R

40|$|Since lipid {{auto-oxidation}} during wort boiling is a determining for {{the appearance}} of staling flavour in aged beers, we have investigated the reducing power of hops added in the boiling kettle. An assay based on the inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation {{in the presence of}} an initiator [2, 2 '-azobis(2 -amidino-propane) dihydrochloride = AAPH] enabled us to distinguish hop varieties and conditionings. Large differences in hop flavanoid contents explained the higher antioxidant activity of low-cr-acid samples versus <b>bitter</b> <b>varieties</b> and CO 2 hop extracts. As expected, adding hop pellets to the kettle effectively increased the overall reducing activity of wort. Supercritical CO 2 hop extracts had no significant effect due to their extremely low level of polyphenols. The concentration of the very well-known marker of beer ageing, trans- 2 -nonenal, was lower in boiled wort exhibiting a better reducing power. The AAPH reducing power test applied to hops or worts was thus efficient to predict the nonenal synthesis during boiling. Hop varieties and conditionings emerged from this work as key-parameters for improving the reducing power of wort and the flavour stability of the final product. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Since a typical apricot kernel weighs 600 mg, <b>bitter</b> and sweet <b>varieties</b> contain respectively 1.8 and 0.3 mg of cyanide.|$|R
40|$|Tomahawk hop (Humulus lupulus) is a {{recently}} developed Super Alpha cultivar (14 - 18 % α-acids w/w), already widely used by brewers to impart bitterness and a citrus-like aroma to beer. By comparison with two <b>bitter</b> <b>varieties</b> (Nelson Sauvin and Nugget) and two aromatic ones (Cascade and Saaz), the Tomahawk cultivar showed a very particular terpenoid profile, rich in both α- and β-selinenes (> 600 mg/kg IST equiv in total), methyl geranate (> 40 mg/kg IST equiv), and geraniol (> 200 mg/kg). Tomahawk also proved {{to contain a}} wide variety of odorant polyfunctional thiols. The major β-sulfanyl acetate, 3 -sulfanyl- 2 -ethylpropyl acetate, newly identified here, was found at similar levels in the famous Sauvignon-like Nelson Sauvin and Tomahawk varieties (15 - 44 μg/kg IST equiv). On the other hand, lower levels of total β-sulfanyl alcohols were measured in Tomahawk, although 3 -sulfanylhexan- 1 -ol was found at a similar level and the 3 -sulfanyl- 4 -methylpentan- 1 -ol previously claimed to be specific to the Nelson Sauvin variety was also evidenced in the Super Alpha cultivar (9 - 13 μg/kg IST equiv). As revealed by boiling and fermentation, Tomahawk hop also contains very interesting bound polyfunctional thiols that should be investigated for better use by brewers...|$|R
40|$|Bitter melon (Momordica charantia L.) has {{traditionally}} {{been used as a}} medicinal food in many developing countries. It is a tropical fruit claimed to have therapeutic effects due to its content of bioactive compounds. The present review is an attempt to highlight the <b>bitter</b> melon <b>varieties,</b> bioactive composition that is linked to its therapeutic effects, especially antidiabetic effect, in vitro and in vivo models, and understanding of the mechanisms of actions of bitter melon that are associated with epidemiological evidences. This paper also outlines a proposed processing scheme aiming to fully utilize bitter melon and add further value to this fruit...|$|R
50|$|One unusual notorious dish is Pagitpagit {{that has}} {{distinctly}} pungent aroma. The ingredients include a brew of cassava leaves, santan (coconut milk), rimbang (a <b>bitter</b> but non-toxic <b>variety</b> of the nightshade family), flowers of some locally-available plants and some arsik sauce, pork or beef meat, mixed with additional unusual substance — juice from a cow’s cud, food {{that has been}} digested and regurgitated.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the kinetics of natural detoxification of hydrogen cyanide contained in retted cassava roots. Retting is traditional fermentation of cassava, performed {{to soften the}} roots. During retting, cyanide diffuses into water used for the retting. The fresh cassava roots (<b>bitter</b> and sweet <b>varieties)</b> used for this experiment were separately retted at ambient 0 temperature of 30 C. The cyanide content and pH were monitored daily. From {{the analysis of the}} experimental results, a first order consecutive rate equation is an adequate tool for explaining the mechanism of HCN reduction (or decay) in retted cassava roots. The detoxification constants for the bound cyanide in the bitter and sweet cassava roots were 0. 378 /day and 0. 438 /day respectively, while that of the free hydrogen cyanide were 0. 63 /day and 0. 74 /day for the <b>bitter</b> and sweet <b>varieties</b> respectively. Cassava tubers from different species cannot be fermented with the same retting condition unless they have same or close functional properties.

40|$|Cassava root is {{the main}} staple for 70 % of the {{population}} in Mozambique, particularly in inaccessible rural areas, but is known to be low in iron. Anaemia is a public health problem in mothers and preschool children in Mozambique and up to 40 % of these cases are probably due to dietary iron deficiency. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recognize the fortification of foodstuff as an effective method to remedy dietary deficiencies of micronutrients, including iron. Cassava mahewu, a non-alcoholic fermented beverage is prepared at subsistence level from cassava roots using indigenous procedures. The aim {{of the study was to}} standardize mahewu fermentation and investigate if the type of cassava fermented, or the iron compound used for fortification affected the final product. Roots of sweet and <b>bitter</b> <b>varieties</b> of cassava from four districts (Rapale, Meconta, Alto Molocue and Zavala) in Mozambique, were peeled, dried and pounded to prepare flour. Cassava flour was cooked and fermented under controlled conditions (45 °C for 24 h). The fermentation period and temperature were set, based on the findings of a pilot study which showed that an end-point pH of about 4. 5 was regularly reached after 24 h at 45 °C. Cassava mahewu was fortified with ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) or ferrous fumarate (C 4 H 2 FeO 4) at the beginning (time zero) and at the end of fermentation (24 h). The amount of iron added to the mahewu was based on the average of the approved range of iron used for the fortification of maize meal. The mean pH at the endpoint was 4. 5, with 0. 29 % titratable acidity. The pH and acidity were different to those reported in previous studies on maize mahewu, whereas the solid extract of 9. 65 % was found to be similar. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeast growth were not significantly different in mahewu fortified with either of the iron compounds. There was no significant difference between cassava mahewu made from <b>bitter</b> or sweet <b>varieties.</b> A standard method for preparation and iron fortification of cassava mahewu was developed. It is recommended that fortification occurs at the end of fermentation when done at household level.
