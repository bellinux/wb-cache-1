These <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> were made necessary {{by the fact}} that intervention prices were set in ECUs and converted into national currency terms at green rates, set at levels different from commercial market rates. This gave rise to price differentials between member nations (in market ECUs) that would influence intra-EC trade if not offset by the MCAs. The system worked by subsidizing exports (and taxing imports) from strong-currency countries, and taxing exports (subsidizing imports) from weak- currency countries.|$|E

Only little research {{attention has been paid}} to assessing the interactions between empirical and normative approaches to climate change in the context of potential trade measures. To this end, the paper focuses on currently discussed carbon <b>border</b> adjustment <b>measures.</b> This paper assesses these trade measures from a normative perspective: it explores whether they are compatible or in conflict with development ethics on the one hand and with climate ethics on the other. The paper finds that <b>border</b> adjustment <b>measures</b> are both a threat to development as well as to a workable climate agreement. It argues that they are therefore both in conflict with development as well as climate ethics concerns. From a development ethics perspective, <b>border</b> adjustment <b>measures</b> are objectionable for two reasons. First, they hurt developing countries and above all the ones that are vulnerable in terms of relying only on few export goods. Second, <b>border</b> adjustment <b>measures</b> restrict market access for developing countries and thereby undermine the potential of trade to foster development.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how domestic price discrimination between fluid and manufacturing milk influences dairy trade. Two types of dairy models {{are used for}} the study. The first one is a stylized mathematical model {{which is used to}} explore the relative trade effects of domestic price discrimination accompanied with revenue pooling mechanism versus <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> in dairy product markets. The second one is a partial equilibrium, multiple-region model of dairy policy and trade, which is used to see the empirical implication of domestic price discrimination for six major dairy producers. The analytical results identify the trading status as the key to determine the relative trade effects. While domestic price discrimination is always less trade distorting than <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> in a net-importer case, the relative trade distortiveness depends on the export volume in a net exporter case. The theoretical possibility that domestic price discrimination is more trade distorting than <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> is found when the ratio of dairy export to domestic manufacturing milk consumption is very high. The results also indicate that while the both support measures increase dairy export, domestic price discrimination may place greater economic burden on fluid milk consumers and less economic burden on tax payers than <b>border</b> <b>measures.</b> In addition, the results imply that domestic price discrimination schemes can be effective trade protective measures for Canada, Japan and the United States, where the schemes are currently being implemented. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ...|$|E

40|$|International {{trade in}} fruits, vegetables, {{processed}} products and other high unit-value products has been expanding rapidly relative {{to trade in}} bulk commodities.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{trade flows}} are being {{affected}} by new discriminatory measures implemented during {{the global financial}} crisis. We match data on behind-the-border measures (e. g., bailouts and subsidies) and <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> implemented through April 2010 to monthly HS 4 -digit bilateral trade data. Our estimation strategy relies on a first-differenced gravity equation and timevarying fixed effects to disentangle the impact of new discriminatory measures. Trade in exporterimporter pairs subject to new measures decreased by 5 to 8 percent relative to trade in the same product among pairs not subject to new measures. These product-level results imply global trade declines at the aggregate level of about 0. 2 percent, or $ 30 - 35 billion a year. These aggregate figures would be higher, if one third of measures had not been excluded due to incomplete data. The paper {{then goes on to}} dissect protectionism’s trade impact by disaggregating measures by type, advanced/developing countries, regions, sectors, and time. Behind-the-border measures are found to have been more harmful than <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> at the product level.

Domestic Support and <b>Border</b> <b>Measures</b> for Processed Horticultural Products In horticultural markets, trade barriers often apply to the processed products whereas domestic support applies to farm-produced raw commodities. Here we assess the effects of such trade barriers and domestic support by simulating the effects of policy reform on global processing tomato markets, which are faced with modest processed product tariffs and high domestic support in the European Union (EU). Both protection and EU subsidy drive down world welfare, but we find that reducing import tariffs for tomato products would yield greater effects on markets and larger welfare impacts outside Europe than would reductions in EU domestic support.

Regional integration is seen as a rational response to the difficulties faced by a continent with many small national markets and landlocked countries. As a result, African governments have concluded {{a very large number of}} regional integration arrangements, several of which have significant membership overlap. While characterized by ambitious targets, they have a dismally poor implementation record. Part of the problem may lie in the paradigm of linear market integration, marked by stepwise integration of goods, labour and capital markets, and eventually monetary and fiscal integration. This tends to focus on <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> such as the import tariff. However, supply-side constraints may be more important. A deeper integration agenda that includes services, investment, competition policy and other behind-the-border issues can address the national-level supply-side constraints far more effectively than an agenda which focuses almost exclusively on <b>border</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|E

40|$|International trade can be {{inhibited}} in two ways; {{through the}} use of mechanisms that directly alter the flow of goods and poor transparency in the rules of trade. The former includes tariffs and other <b>border</b> <b>measures,</b> subsidies and non-tariff barriers. The effect on trade flows resulting from issues of transparency is indirect. When the rules of trade are unclear for firms considering investing in trade related activities, the risks associated with those investments increase and investment is inhibited. If there is less investment in trade related activities, trade flows will be reduced. Poor transparency exists in contingent protection measures such as anti-dumping – currently on the agenda of the Rules negotiations at the WTO and – customs and related procedures – on the agenda in the Trade Facilitation negotiations. Increasing transparency can have important trade liberalizing effects. Trade negotiators often focus on achieving a big result from reductions in <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> and subsidies where there may be considerable resistance from protectionist vested interests. If progress can be made in increasing the transparency of trade rules, a less ambitious result may be acceptable for the direct aspects of trade liberalization. investment, liberalization, risk, transparency, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
