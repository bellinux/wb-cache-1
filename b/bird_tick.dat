40|$|Ticks are {{the most}} {{important}} vectors of disease-causing pathogens in Europe. In the U. K., Ixodes ricinus L. (Ixodida: Ixodidae) transmits louping ill virus (LIV; Flaviviridae), which kills livestock and red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus Lath. (Galliformes: Phasianidae), a valuable game <b>bird.</b> <b>Tick</b> burdens on grouse have been increasing. One novel method to reduce ticks and LIV in grouse may be acaricide treatment. Here, we use a mathematical model parameterized with empirical data to investigate how the acaricide treatment of grouse might theoretically control ticks and LIV in grouse. Assuming a situation in which ticks and LIV impact on the grouse population, the model predicts that grouse density will depend on deer density because deer maintain the tick population. In low deer densities, no acaricide treatment is predicted to be necessary because abundances of grouse will be high. However, at higher deer densities, the model predicts that grouse densities will increase only if high numbers of grouse are treated, and the efficacy of acaricide is high and lasts 20 weeks. The qualitative model predictions may help to guide decisions on whether to treat grouse or cull deer depending on deer densities and how many grouse can be treated. The model is discussed in terms of practical management implications...|$|E

40|$|Ticks are {{important}} vectors of emerging zoonotic diseases affecting {{human and animal}} health worldwide. Ticks are often found on wild birds, which have been long recognized as a potential risk factor for dissemination of ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBP), thus raising societal concerns and prompting research into their biology and ecology. To fully understand the role of birds in disseminating some ticks species and TBP, {{it is important to}} consider the evolutionary relationships between <b>birds,</b> <b>ticks</b> and transmitted pathogens. In this paper we reviewed the possible role of birds in the dissemination of TBP as a result of the evolution of host-tick-pathogen associations. Birds are central elements in the ecological networks of ticks, hosts and TBP. The study of host-tick-pathogen associations reveals a prominent role for birds in the dissemination of Borrelia spp. and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, with little contribution to the possible dissemination of other TBP. Birds have played a major role during tick evolution, which explains why they are by far the most important hosts supporting the ecological networks of ticks and several TBP. The immune response of <b>birds</b> to <b>ticks</b> and TBP has been largely overlooked. To implement effective measures for the control of tick-borne diseases, it is necessary to study bird-tick and bird-pathogen molecular interactions including the immune response of <b>birds</b> to <b>tick</b> infestation and pathogen infection.

To investigate whether this is true for rickettsial agents, we undertook a study to characterize tick infestation in populations of the migratory passerine bird Riparia riparia (Passeriformes: Hirundinidae), the sand martin. A total of 194 birds were sampled and ticks removed from infested <b>birds.</b> The <b>ticks</b> were identified as female Ixodes lividus (Acari: Ixodidae) using standard morphological and molecular techniques.

In this sample group the majority of ticks were molecularly identified as Ixodes ricinus, and three individuals collected from the European robin as Hyalomma marginatum marginatum. The latter is the first molecularly confirmed occurrence of this species in Hungary. Rickettsia aeschlimannii was detected in H. marginatum, also for the first time in Hungary, and in ticks from an urbanized bird species north of the Mediterranean countries. The overall prevalence range of rickettsiae (including R. helvetica and R. monacensis) in <b>ticks</b> of synanthropic <b>birds</b> was 29 - 40 %, exceeding that in questing ticks of relevant species reported earlier. Additionally, in specimens of I. ricinus, the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s. l.), Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and a new Francisella-like genotype was also verified.

In Panama, we found immature ticks on 227 out of 3, 498 individually-sampled birds representing 93 host species (24 % of the bird species sampled, and 13 % of the Panamanian land <b>bird</b> fauna). <b>Tick</b> parasitism rates did not vary with rainfall or temperature, but did vary significantly with several host ecological traits.

Here we elucidate roles of wild passerine birds, eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus), and Ixodes dentatus ticks in enzootic cycles of two spirochetes, Borrelia miyamotoi and B. andersonii in a region of Michigan where the zoonotic pathogen B. burgdorferi co-circulates. Methods Over a four-year period, wild birds (n = 19, 631) and rabbits (n = 20) were inspected for tick presence and ear tissue was obtained from rabbits. Samples were tested for Borrelia spirochetes using nested PCR of the 16 S- 23 S rRNA intergenic spacer region (IGS) and bidirectional DNA sequencing. Natural xenodiagnosis was used to implicate wildlife reservoirs. Results Ixodes dentatus, a tick that specializes on birds and rabbits and rarely bites humans, {{was the most common}} tick found, comprising 86. 5 % of the 12, 432 ticks collected in the study. The relapsing fever group spirochete B. miyamotoi was documented {{for the first time in}} ticks removed from wild birds (0. 7 % minimum infection prevalence; MIP, in I. dentatus), and included two IGS strains. The majority of B. miyamotoi -positive ticks were removed from Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis). Borrelia andersonii infected <b>ticks</b> removed from <b>birds</b> (1. 6 % MIP), ticks removed from rabbits (5. 3 % MIP), and rabbit ear biopsies (5 %) comprised twelve novel IGS strains. Six species of wild birds were implicated as reservoirs for B. andersonii. Frequency of I. dentatus larval and nymphal co-feeding on birds was ten times greater than expected by chance. The relatively well-studied ecology of I. scapularis and the Lyme disease pathogen provides a context for understanding how the phenology of <b>bird</b> <b>ticks</b> may impact B. miyamotoi and B. andersonii prevalence and host associations. Conclusions Given the current invasion of I. scapularis, a human biting species that serves as a bridge vector for Borrelia spirochetes, human exposure to B. miyamotoi and B. andersonii in this region may increase. The presence of these spirochetes underscores the ecological complexity within which Borrelia organisms are maintained and the need for diagnostic tests to differentiate among these organisms. </p...|$|R

Migratory birds were trapped on Grindul Lupilor (44 ° 41 'N; 28 ° 56 'E) using mist nets during 4 migratory seasons (2 spring and 2 autumn) in 2011 and 2012. From each <b>bird,</b> all the <b>ticks</b> were collected and identified based on morphological features. Epidemiological parameters (prevalence, mean abundance, mean intensity) were calculated and all data were analysed statistically based on the season (spring and autumn), regional status of birds (migrants and breeding) and foraging behaviour (ground feeders, reed-bed feeders, foliage feeders). A total of 1434 birds (46 species) were captured. Ticks were found on 94 birds (10 species). Significantly more migratory <b>birds</b> hosted <b>ticks,</b> compared to resident birds. The 400 collected ticks belonged to four species: Ixodes ricinus (92. 25 %), I. arboricola (6. 25 %), I. redikorzevi (1. 00 %) and Haemaphysalis punctata (0. 50 %). A higher prevalence was found for I. ricinus in spring, with higher prevalence of nymphs in this season, while larvae occurred with the same prevalence in both seasons. Larval intensity was higher during spring and nymphs were more abundant during autumn. The seasonal differences in our study may be related not to the local seasonal dynamics of ticks, but on the seasonal dynamics at the site of migration initiation...|$|R
40|$|We report <b>tick</b> infestations on <b>birds,</b> in the {{environment}} and on domestic animals in a non-forested phytophysiognomy, the savanna-like Cerrado sensu stricto, in a natural reserve {{on the outskirts of}} the urban area of Uberl&# 226;ndia, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Overall, 238 birds within 50 species, 15 families and six orders were caught. Passeriformes were the most numerous, with 216 birds (90. 75 %), among which 22 had ticks (n = 31). Within this order, the prevalence of tick infestation was 10. 2 %, and the abundance and mean intensity were 0. 14 and 1. 41, respectively. Only immature ticks of the species Amblyomma nodosum were found on the <b>birds.</b> The <b>tick</b> species found both on animals (Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, Amblyomma cajennense and Dermacentor nitens) and in {{the environment}} (Amblyomma dubitatum, Rhipicephalus (B.) microplus and Amblyomma cajennense) were as expected. This difference in tick species between the environment and birds possibly occurred because the sampling of the environment was limited to the ground. This study also highlights the importance of the diverse microenvironments used by ticks and hosts in the same area and the complex ecology of bird-tick relationships. Ecological and epidemiological aspects of the findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2006 New Holland Honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae, Meliphagidae) were {{examined}} for tick and blood parasite prevalence and intensity during a single breeding season (June–November 2004) at four locations in South Australia. We examined 126 <b>birds</b> for <b>ticks</b> and 110 of these birds for blood parasites. Twenty-two birds (17. 5 %) were infested with {{one to two}} ticks from the genus Ixodes. Ten birds (9. 1 %) were infected with blood parasites from the genus Haemoproteus (intensity was low, on average 0. 016 % infected blood cells). There was no relation between blood parasite and <b>tick</b> prevalence within <b>birds</b> and across sites. We found no relationship between blood parasites and site, or age, sex, or body condition of hosts. Tick prevalence {{was significantly related to}} host age (being higher in juveniles than adults), site (ticks were only found in coastal areas), and reduced body condition. This study provides preliminary evidence for a geographical pattern of tick (Ixodes sp.) distribution: we found ticks on Kangaroo Island and in a coastal area of the Fleurieu Peninsula, but not at sites more inland within the Mount Lofty Ranges...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 118 Borrelia {{isolates}} were cultured from {{a variety}} of rodents, <b>birds,</b> and <b>ticks</b> collected in the southern United States. In addition to a highly diverse group of Borrelia bissettii strains and a homogenous group of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strains, a group of 16 isolates with unusual characteristics was found. The isolates were cultured from ear biopsy samples of the rodents Peromyscus gossypinus and Neotoma floridana trapped at five localities in South Carolina. A multilocus sequence analysis of the rrf-rrl intergenic spacer, 16 S rRNA, fla, ospA, and p 66 genes were used to clarify the taxonomic status of the new group of B. burgdorferi sensu lato isolates. Thirteen species of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex were used as controls. Unique restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns of the rrf-rrl intergenic spacer region and fla gene were recognized. Unique signature nucleotides were also found in the 16 S rRNA gene. A phylogenetic analysis shows that the 16 new isolates cluster together but separately from the other species in the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex. Our data strongly support the recognition of the 16 isolates as a new B. burgdorferi sensu lato species. We propose to name this genospecies “Borrelia carolinensis” with respect to the place of its currently known geographic location...|$|R
