D'Oyly had arrived in England with William I in the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 and William the Conqueror granted him {{extensive}} lands in Oxfordshire. Oxford had been stormed in the invasion with considerable damage, and William directed D'Oyly to build a castle to dominate the town. In due course D'Oyly became the foremost landowner in Oxfordshire and was confirmed with a hereditary royal constableship for Oxford Castle. Oxford Castle is not among the 48 recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> castle in existence {{at the time was}} recorded in the survey.|$|E

25|$|Since it {{sequences}} {{its laws}} by subject matter instead of by biblical context, the Mishnah discusses individual subjects more thoroughly than the Midrash, {{and it includes}} a much broader selection of halakhic subjects than the Midrash. The Mishnah's topical organization thus became {{the framework of the}} Talmud as a whole. <b>But</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> tractate in the Mishnah has a corresponding Gemara.

25|$|The {{bundle of}} {{differential}} forms, at each point, consists of all totally antisymmetric multilinear maps on the tangent space at that point. It is naturally divided into n-forms for each n at most {{equal to the}} dimension of the manifold; an n-form is an n-variable form, also called a form of degree n. The 1-forms are the cotangent vectors, while the 0-forms are just scalar functions. In general, an n-form is a tensor with cotangent rank n and tangent rank 0. <b>But</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> such tensor is a form, as a form must be antisymmetric.|$|E
25|$|Note the {{difference}} between the earlier formal definition for the big-O notation, and the present definition of little-o: while the former has to be true for at least one constant M the latter must hold for every positive constant , however small. In this way, little-o notation makes a stronger statement than the corresponding big-O notation: every function that is little-o of g is also big-O of g, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> function that is big-O of g is also little-o of g (for instance g itself is not, unless it is identically zero near ∞).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the angels, Islam assumes the existence of other invisible creatures including Jinn. Besides they also belong to the supernatural creatures, they are distinguished from the angels, since they have some characteristics in common with humans and differ from the angels. Unlike angels, the Jinn are mortals and it is said, they also eat, drink, procreate, die and have desires. Furthermore, the angels belong to the celestial realm, even they can travel to other realms, if their tasks requires it, while Jinn are assumed to live either next to humans on earth or in an intermediary realm. Because both angels and jinn are invisible, some scholars hold, both angels and jinn are jinn, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> jinn is an angel.|$|E

In 1669, under Louis XIV, the city was already lit with three {{thousand}} oil lamps, suspended in the middle of the street at a height of twenty feet, with twenty feet between each lantern, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> street was lit, and the light was usually very dim; those going out at night or to the theater were usually obliged to hire a lantern-bearer to light their way until the end of the century. Between 1745 and 1769, the old lanterns were gradually replaced by a new model called a réverbère which, mounted on a lamp post, gave off a much brighter light. By 1789 there were 5,694 new lanterns in service. A few years later the most popular revolutionary song, Ça ira! urged Parisians to hang aristocrats from the new lanterns.|$|E
25|$|Ranji Trophy – Founded as the 'Cricket Championship of India' at {{a meeting}} of the Board of Control for Cricket in India in July 1934. The first Ranji Trophy {{fixtures}} took place in the 1934–35 season. Syed Mohammed Hadi of Hyderabad was the first batsman to score a century in the tournament. The Trophy was donated by H.H. Sir Bhupendra Singh Mahinder Baha-dur, Maharajah of Patiala in memory of His late Highness Sir Ranjitsinhji Vibhaji of Nawanagar, affectionately called as Ranjitsinhji. In the main, the Ranji Trophy is composed of teams representing the states that make up India. As the political states have multiplied, so have cricket teams, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> state has a team. Some states have more than one cricket team, e.g. Maharashtra and Gujarat. There are also 'odd' teams like Railways, and Services representing the armed forces. The various teams used to be grouped into zones – North, West, East, Central and South – and the initial matches were played on a league basis within the zones. The top two (until 1991–92) and then top three teams (subsequent years) from each zone then played in a national knock-out competition. Starting with the 2002–03 season, the zonal system has been abandoned and a two-division structure has been adopted with two teams being promoted from the plate league and two relegated from the elite league. If the knockout matches are not finished they are decided on the first-innings lead.|$|E

Similarly, in United States v. Bailey (1835), the Court held that {{the question of whether the}} evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified. And, certificates of division began to fall into disuse as it became increasingly common for the circuit courts to sit with a single judge. As Chief Justice Marshall wrote, he did not have [...] "the privilege of dividing the court when alone." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the number}} of base-pairs of DNA in the human genome has been known since the 1960s, the {{estimated}} number of genes has changed over time as definitions of genes, and methods of detecting them have been refined. Initial theoretical predictions of {{the number of}} human genes were as high as 2,000,000. Early experimental measures indicated there to be 50,000–100,000 transcribed genes (expressed sequence tags). Subsequently, the sequencing in the Human Genome Project indicated that many of these transcripts were alternative variants of the same genes, and the total number of protein-coding genes was revised down to ~20,000 with 13 genes encoded on the mitochondrial genome. Of the human genome, only 1–2% consists of protein-coding genes, with the remainder being 'noncoding' DNA such as introns, retrotransposons, and noncoding RNAs.
