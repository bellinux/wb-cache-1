40|$|Abstract — A {{numerical}} {{study is}} {{presented in this paper}} to examine the dynamic behavior for the detailed characterization of commercially available Ni-MH battery. In the present study, a novel Multi-Regression Analysis (MRA) based model for the D-size HHR 650 D battery from panasonic is adopted to ascertain the charge and discharge characteristics along with its SoC estimation. Oxygen gas formation at the Ni electrode during charging and overcharging that affects the pressure variations inside the battery is essential to be analyzed for its characterization. Henceforth, the effect of <b>battery</b> <b>charging</b> <b>conditions</b> over the pressure and temperature variations are considered in the developed MRA model and the corresponding performance profiles subjected to recurrent load cycles are reported. Model validation of the steady state behavior is performed based on the benchmark data obtained from a 6. 5 Ah, 1. 2 V Nickel-Metal Hydride battery. The result obtained shows that the regression model responses fit well with the benchmark result. Moreover, the model can also predict pressure and temperature dynamics under a sudden change in charging and discharging states. The characterization results show that the proposed regression model of Ni-MH battery could be suited effectively for any kind of model based plug-in or hybrid electric vehicle technologies.

40|$|With {{the current}} {{surge in the}} {{development}} and use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) due to increased environmental consciousness, methods to increase the driving range and improve the <b>battery</b> <b>charging</b> <b>conditions</b> of these vehicles have become important research areas. Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) is one of the solutions to the challenges currently faced by EV manufacturers and customers. IPT is a method that is used to transfer power over large air gaps and has proven to be efficient, reliable and convenient in the charging of electric vehicles and also for factory automation systems and charging of consumer devices such as mobile phones. In some cases, it necessary to have transmitter and receiver topologies having multiple coils especially in a three phase IPT highway system or a table top IPT system for charging many consumer devices or mobile phones at the same time. Multi coil topologies are also used in lumped charge pad topologies to enable better misalignment tolerances. In such cases it is necessary to mutually decouple these multiple coils to avoid interactions that could affect the efficiency of power transfer. The current state of the art systems offer solutions that lead to the decoupling of multiple coils by their relative spatial position, and are hence limited. Multi coil systems operating at the same frequency also generate magnetic fields that add or cancel out each other, thereby changing the air gap magnetic field orientation depending on which coil is powered. A multi frequency IPT system developed in this thesis aims to provide a solution to the above challenges. A multi coil primary system with two coils carrying currents of different frequencies can be designed to transfer power independently without interactions between the two different frequency systems. This thesis develops this concept by first investigating the need for decoupling multi coil transmitter and receiver designs. Multi frequency IPT is then introduced and the design considerations are developed in order to achieve a frequency decoupled IPT system. Experimental results of the proposed multi frequency method using two transmitter coils are also presented. Finally, a comparison is provided between this proposed multi frequency method using two transmitter coils and another recently published method that amplifies the third harmonic along with the fundamental from the input inverter, thereby achieving multi frequency IPT using one transmitter coil.

40|$|This report {{demonstrates}} improvements made in <b>battery</b> <b>charging</b> and <b>battery</b> management technology {{through the}} design of a universal programmable <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> with optional <b>battery</b> management system attachment. This charger offers improvements in charge efficiency and unique <b>battery</b> <b>charging</b> algorithms to charge a variety of battery chemistries with variety of power requirements. Improvements in efficiency result from a synchronous Buck Controller topology as compared to previous universal chargers that use asynchronous Buck-Boost Converter topologies. This <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> also surpasses current universal battery chargers by offering different charge modes for different <b>battery</b> chemistries. <b>Charge</b> modes provide the user an option between extending the life of the battery by selecting a mode with a slower, less stressful charge rate or a shorter charge time with a fast, more stressful charging mode. The user can also choose a charge mode in which the <b>battery</b> <b>charges</b> to full capacity, resulting in maximum runtime or a less than full capacity, which puts less stress on the battery thus extending the lifetime. Ultimately, this system permits weighing the performance tradeoff of <b>battery</b> lifetime and <b>charge</b> time. The optional battery management system attachment offers more precise monitoring of each cell and cell balancing for Li-Ion batteries. This further enhances the performance of the charger when integrated, but is not necessary for <b>charger</b> operation. The <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> consists of three subcircuits: A microcontroller unit, a power stage, and a current sensing circuit. A C 2000 Piccolo F 28069 microcontroller controls a LM 5117 Buck Controller by injecting a pulse-width modulated signal into the feedback node controlling the output of the buck to set a constant current or constant voltage thus creating a programmable <b>battery</b> <b>charger.</b> The pulse-width modulated signal changes according to charge algorithms created in software for specific <b>battery</b> chemistries and <b>charge</b> requirements. An analog-to-digital converter on the microcontroller monitors battery voltage by using a voltage divider and an INA 169 current shunt monitor, which outputs a voltage corresponding to the charge current to another analog-to-digital converter on the microcontroller, monitors the charge current. This allows the charger program to maintain correct and safe <b>charging</b> <b>conditions</b> for each <b>charge</b> mode in addition to measuring output power. Lights on the microcontroller display a real-time status to the user of which portion of the charge profile the charger is in. A solid red light means the charger is in the constant current portion of the charge profile. A blinking red light means the charger is in the constant voltage portion. No red light means the <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> finished and the <b>battery</b> is currently <b>charged</b> above nominal voltage. The <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> works with the battery management system in the next section to provide ultimate <b>battery</b> <b>charging</b> and managing capabilities. The battery management system consists of two subcircuits: A microcontroller and a battery monitoring circuit. The MSP 430 FR 5969 microcontroller unit communicates with BQ 76 PL 536 battery management integrated circuits to create a battery management system that monitors data such as cell voltage, pack voltage, pack temperature, state of charge, fault statuses, alert statuses, {{and a variety of other}} useful cell parameters. This data displays on a liquid crystal display screen through different menu options.
