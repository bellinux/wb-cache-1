5|$|The {{remaining}} {{portion of}} the en echelon attack was the responsibility of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division of A.P.

5|$|Longstreet's attack {{commenced}} with a 30-minute artillery barrage by 36 {{guns that}} was particularly punishing to the Union infantry in the Peach Orchard and {{the troops and}} batteries on Houck's Ridge. Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood's division deployed in Biesecker's Woods on Warfield Ridge (the southern extension of Seminary Ridge) in two lines of two brigades each: at the left front, <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Jerome B. Robertson's Texas Brigade (Hood's old unit); right front, <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Evander M. Law; left rear, <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> George T.

5|$|Jeb Stuart and {{his three}} cavalry brigades arrived in Gettysburg around noon but had {{no role in the}} second day's battle. <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Wade Hampton's brigade fought a minor {{engagement}} with newly promoted 23-year-old <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> George Armstrong Custer's Michigan cavalry near Hunterstown to the northeast of Gettysburg.|$|E
5|$|The {{target of}} the Confederate assault {{was the center of}} the Union Army of the Potomac's II Corps, {{commanded}} by Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock. Directly in the center was the division of <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> John Gibbon with the brigades of <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> William Harrow, Col. Norman J. Hall, and <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Alexander S. Webb. (On the night of July 2, Meade correctly predicted to Gibbon at a council of war that Lee would try an attack on Gibbon's sector the following morning.) To the north of this position were brigades from the division of <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Alexander Hays, and to the south was Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday's division of the I Corps, including the 2nd Vermont Brigade of <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> George J. Stannard and the 121st Pennsylvania under the command of Col. Chapman Biddle. Meade's headquarters were just behind the II Corps line, in the small house owned by the widow Lydia Leister.|$|E

5|$|McPherson's corps was {{assigned}} to attack the center along the Jackson Road. On their right flank, the brigade of <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Thomas E. G. Ransom advanced to within 100 yards of the Confederate line, but halted to avoid dangerous flanking fire from Green's Redan. On McPherson's left flank, the division of Maj. Gen. John A. Logan {{was assigned}} to assault the 3rd Louisiana Redan and the Great Redoubt. The brigade of <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> John E. Smith made {{it as far as}} the slope of the redan, but huddled there, dodging grenades until dark before they were recalled. <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> John D. Stevenson's brigade advanced well in two columns against the redoubt, but their attack also failed when they found their ladders were too short to scale the fortification. <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Isaac F. Quinby's division advanced a few hundred yards, but halted for hours while its generals engaged in confused discussions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{after hearing}} {{news of the}} day's victory, <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Judson Kilpatrick {{launched}} a cavalry attack against the infantry positions of Longstreet's Corps southwest of Big Round Top. <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Elon J. Farnsworth protested against the futility of such a move, but obeyed orders. Farnsworth {{was killed in the}} attack, and his brigade suffered significant losses.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, {{with the}} fort surrounded, the Confederates, {{commanded}} by <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> John B. Floyd, launched a surprise {{attack against the}} right flank of Grant's army {{in an attempt to}} open an escape route to Nashville, Tennessee. Grant, who was away from the battlefield {{at the start of the}} attack, arrived to rally his men and counterattack. Despite achieving partial success and opening the way for a retreat, Floyd lost his nerve and ordered his men back to the fort. The following morning, Floyd and his second-in-command, <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Gideon Johnson Pillow, escaped with a small detachment of troops, relinquishing command to <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Simon Bolivar Buckner, who accepted Grant's terms of unconditional surrender later that day.|$|E

5|$|On the Union left, McClernand's corps {{moved along}} the Baldwin Ferry Road and astride the Southern Railroad of Mississippi. The {{division}} of <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Eugene A. Carr {{was assigned to}} capture the Railroad Redoubt and the 2nd Texas Lunette; the division of <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Peter J. Osterhaus was assigned the Square Fort. Carr's men achieved a small breakthrough at the 2nd Texas Lunette and requested reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|On the {{southern}} flank, the North Carolina brigade of <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> James H. Lane contributed {{little to the}} assault; he was kept busy by a clash with Union cavalry on the Hagerstown Road. <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Edward L. Thomas's Georgia Brigade was in reserve well to the rear, not summoned by Pender or Hill to assist or exploit the breakthrough.|$|E
5|$|Rodes {{initially}} sent three brigades south against Union {{troops that}} represented the right {{flank of the}} I Corps and the left flank of the XI Corps: from east to west, <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> George P. Doles, Col. Edward A. O'Neal, and <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Alfred Iverson. Doles's Georgia brigade stood guarding the flank, awaiting the arrival of Early's division. Both O'Neal's and Iverson's attacks fared poorly against the six veteran regiments in the brigade of <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Henry Baxter, manning a line in a shallow inverted V, facing north on the ridge behind the Mummasburg Road. O'Neal's men were sent forward without coordinating with Iverson on their flank and fell back under heavy fire from the I Corps troops.|$|E

5|$|Around 2 p.m., the Confederate Second Corps {{divisions}} of Maj. Gens. Robert E. Rodes and Jubal Early assaulted and out-flanked the Union I and XI Corps positions north and northwest of town. The Confederate brigades of Col. Edward A. O'Neal and <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Alfred Iverson suffered severe losses assaulting the I Corps division of <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> John C. Robinson south of Oak Hill. Early's division profited from a blunder by <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Francis C. Barlow, when he advanced his XI Corps division to Blocher's Knoll (directly {{north of town}} and now known as Barlow's Knoll); this represented a salient in the corps line, susceptible to attack from multiple sides, and Early's troops overran Barlow's division, which constituted the right flank of the Union Army's position. Barlow was wounded and captured in the attack.|$|E
5|$|Early {{the next}} day, Tuesday, July 1, McClellan, having come from nearby Haxall's Landing the night before, {{examined}} his army's battle line on Malvern Hill. His inspection left him worried {{most about the}} Union Army's right (eastern) flank, which lay behind Western Run. Western Run was an area necessary for McClellan's plans to relocate to Harrison's Landing, and he feared an attack might come from there. As a result, he posted the largest portion of his army there: two divisions from Edwin Sumner's II Corps, two divisions from <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Samuel P. Heintzelman's III Corps, two divisions from <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> William Franklin's VI Corps and one division from Maj. Gen. Erasmus Keyes's IV Corps, who were stationed across the James. The division under <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> George McCall, badly damaged in the fighting at Glendale with McCall himself wounded and captured, was held in general reserve.|$|E
5|$|North of the pike, Davis {{gained a}} {{temporary}} success against <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Lysander Cutler's brigade but was repulsed with heavy losses in an action around an unfinished railroad bed {{cut in the}} ridge. South of the pike, Archer's brigade assaulted through Herbst (also known as McPherson's) Woods. The U.S. Iron Brigade under <b>Brig.</b> <b>Gen.</b> Solomon Meredith enjoyed initial success against Archer, capturing several hundred men, including Archer himself.|$|E
