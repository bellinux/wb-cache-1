Under his direction, the new company built two furnaces on the Butz farm along the Lehigh River, establishing a community that would become Hokendauqua, Pennsylvania. Furnace No. 1 was put in blast on June 3, 1855, and Furnace No. 2 on October 27, 1855.|$|E
50|$|In the {{original}} {{versions of the}} Darrieus design, the aerofoils are arranged {{so that they are}} symmetrical and have zero rigging angle, that is, the angle that the aerofoils are set relative to the structure on which they are mounted. This arrangement is equally effective no matter which direction the wind is <b>blowing—in</b> contrast to the conventional type, which must be rotated to face into the wind.|$|E

50|$|Inspired both by Geisenhainer and Crane (whose {{success was}} closely {{followed}} by the LC&N), experiments in the US continued. Baughman, Guiteau and Company used an old furnace near Mauch Chunk to produce some anthracite iron during late 1837. They built another experimental furnace nearby, which was worked for about two months during fall and winter 1838 and for some time in 1839, but mechanical deficiencies led them to abandon the furnace {{at the end of}} 1839. In the meantime, Pioneer Furnace, in Pottsville, was blown in using anthracite fuel in 1839. It was built by William Lyman obtained the aid of a Welsh emigrant, Benjamin Perry, who was familiar with Neilson's process and the Yniscedwyn works, for the <b>blowing-in.</b> The furnace ran for three months on anthracite alone and fulfilled the conditions to win the $5,000 prize. In the design of Pioneer Furnace, Lyman had also been assisted by David Thomas, who had arrived in the United States in May 1839. Thomas was engaged by the LC&N to set up the Lehigh Crane Iron Company and its first furnace at Catasauqua, which went into blast in 1840, along with five other anthracite furnaces. This marked the commercial establishment of anthracite iron production in the United States.|$|E
40|$|In the {{phenomenon}} of heat transfer from {{the wall of a}} solid body to fluid，the existence of two phase boundary layer，that is, the existence of the air phase in the fluid phase is the matter frequently experienced in the fields of mechanical engineering and chemical engineering. The author performed a few basic experiments on the effects upon the heat transfer by blowing air bubbles into liquid (fluid) -distilled water-in order to ascertain the stirring effect in the course of heat transfer between a vertical board heating surface and the fluid contacting with the board. The result obtained is as follows： 1) Blowing air bubbles into the fluid greatly influences upon the heat transfer. Especially the ratio of its increase is considerably far remarkable compared with the experimental result with a horizontal board heating surface. 2) The forms of <b>blowing-in</b> of air bubbles are in general likely to be classified into four types of a sphere type，a bell type，a precession type and a tandem type which are approximately similar to produced bubbles at the time of nucleal boiling...|$|E
