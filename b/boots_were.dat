5|$|In the 1st and 2nd centuries, a Roman soldier's clothes {{consisted}} of a single-piece, short-sleeved tunic the hem of which reached the knees and special hobnailed sandals (caligae). This attire, which left the arms and legs bare, had evolved in a Mediterranean climate and was not suitable for northern Europe in cold weather. In northern Europe, long-sleeved tunics, trousers (bracae), socks (worn inside the caligae) and laced <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> commonly worn in winter from the 1st century. During the 3rd century, these items of clothing became much more widespread, apparently common in Mediterranean provinces also. However, {{it is likely that}} in warmer weather, trousers were dispensed with and caligae worn instead of socks and boots. Late Roman clothing was often highly decorated, with woven or embroidered strips, clavi, circular roundels, orbiculi, or square panels, tabulae, added to tunics and cloaks. These colourful decorative elements usually {{consisted of}} geometrical patterns and stylised plant motifs, but could include human or animal figures. A distinctive part of a soldier's costume, though it seems to have also been worn by non-military bureaucrats, was a type of round, brimless hat known as the pannonian cap (pileus pannonicus).|$|E
5|$|The mounted police {{influenced}} {{the creation of}} other imperial units during the conflict. Lord Strathcona, the Canadian High Commissioner in London, raised a unit of mounted infantry modelled on the force, believing this would be particularly suitable for taking on Boer scouting parties. Thirty-three serving members of the police joined the unit, including Superintendent Samuel Steel, who became their commanding officer. The Strathconas wore the mounted police's Stetson hat {{as part of their}} uniform, while in turn their distinctive <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> adopted by the police as their official footwear in 1901. The South African Constabulary was created in October 1900 to police the recaptured territories; it mirrored the mounted police, with its members again wearing the force's Stetson hat; it incorporated forty-two members of the mounted police and one of its divisions was commanded by Steele. The mounted police volunteers suffered seven casualties during the conflict. Sergeant Arthur Richardson, a member of the Strathconas, won the Victoria Cross for rescuing a Canadian soldier under heavy fire at Wolve Spruit. In 1904, the Crown renamed the force the Royal North-West Mounted Police to honour its contributions in the war.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after the war, many teams in Europe were forced to wear unusual kits due to clothing restrictions. England's Oldham Athletic, who had traditionally worn blue and white, spent two seasons playing in red and white shirts borrowed from a local rugby league club, and Scotland's Clyde wore khaki. In the 1950s kits worn by players in southern Europe and South America became much more lightweight, with V-necks replacing collars on shirts and synthetic fabrics replacing heavy natural fibres. The first boots to be cut below the ankle rather than high-topped were introduced by Adidas in 1954. Although they cost {{twice as much as}} existing styles the <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> a huge success and cemented the German company's place in the football market. Around the same time Adidas also developed the first boots with screw-in studs which could be changed according to pitch conditions. Other areas were slower to adopt the new styles – British clubs again resisted change and stuck resolutely to kits little different from those worn before the war, and Eastern European teams continued to wear kits that were deemed old-fashioned elsewhere. The FC Dynamo Moscow team that toured Western Europe in 1945 drew almost as much comment for the players' long baggy shorts as for the quality of their football. With the advent of international competitions such as the European Cup, the southern European style spread {{to the rest of the}} continent and by the end of the decade the heavy shirts and boots of the pre-war years had fallen entirely out of use. The 1960s saw little innovation in kit design, with clubs generally opting for simple colour schemes which looked good under the newly adopted floodlights. Designs from the late 1960s and early 1970s are highly regarded by football fans.|$|E
5000|$|Snow <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> {{waterproof}} {{or water}} resistant, but winter <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> not.|$|R
50|$|Sheepskin <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> <b>boots</b> {{made from}} {{sheepskin}}. The wool on sheepskin has good insulating properties and so such <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> commonly worn {{when it is}} cold.|$|R
50|$|Bell <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> {{usually made}} of rubber. They may be open, with Velcro or other {{fastenings}} to close them, or closed and slipped {{on over the}} hoof. Although open bell <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> the easiest to apply, close bell <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> more secure as they have no chance of slipping off.|$|R
25|$|Men wore {{stockings}} or netherstocks {{and flat}} shoes with rounded toes, with slashes {{early in the}} period and ties over the instep later. <b>Boots</b> <b>were</b> worn for riding.|$|E
25|$|After {{traveling}} through Northern California {{in the spring}} of 1851, two gold prospectors reported seeing an erupting volcano that “threw up fire to a terrible height.” They further claimed that they walked 10 miles over rocks so hot that their <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> entirely destroyed.|$|E
25|$|William North was a bootmaker from Haconby {{who founded}} North Shoes in 1876. It is {{believed}} that his wife Sarah saw the property for sale whilst visiting the market in Bourne. <b>Boots</b> <b>were</b> made by up to 12 workers until 1914, when increased demand lead to sourcing elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Harness <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> {{very similar}} to {{engineer}} <b>boots.</b> The <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> most often made of heavy weight leather and range in height from short (10 inches) to extra high (38 inches). The most typical height is between 10 and 18 inches. The most common color is black, but brown harness <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> also made.|$|R
2500|$|Hard <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> {{used with}} special bindings. They {{are similar to}} skier's boots. [...] Hard <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> heavier than soft boots, and also have an inner bladder.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Boot</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{written by}} Micha Niskin and Alan Dipert {{as part of}} the Hoplon web framework. As of May 2015, <b>Boot</b> <b>is</b> developed and released independently of Hoplon. <b>Boot</b> <b>is</b> implemented as an executable entry point and a set of Clojure libraries {{that can be used to}} develop build processes programmatically. The spirit of <b>Boot's</b> design <b>is</b> captured by its tag line, [...] "Builds are programs. Let's start treating them that way." ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> {{made from}} felt and leather and though heavy would be {{comfortable}} and {{wide enough to}} accommodate the trousers tucked in before lacing tightly. They were heelless, though the soles were thick and lined with fur. Worn with felt socks, the feet were unlikely to get cold.|$|E
25|$|Caligae: {{military}} boots worn by legionaries and auxiliaries {{throughout the}} history of the Roman Republic and Empire. The <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> made from leather and laced up the center of the foot and onto the top of the ankle. Iron hobnails were hammered into the sole for added strength. Similar to the modern cleat.|$|E
25|$|The {{officers}} were given New Zealand battledress, dyed blue to wear and a conventional hat, also dyed blue. The other ranks were given blue dyed World War One uniforms with a diamond shaped khaki patch sown {{on the back}} of the jacket and the front and back of the right thigh of the trousers. <b>Boots</b> <b>were</b> also provided.|$|E
50|$|Motocross <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} specifically for off-road, motocross (MX) or all-terrain vehicle riding. To help prevent a rider's feet and legs from being injured, motocross <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> typically much stiffer than regular motorcycle boots or racing <b>boots,</b> but <b>are</b> more flexible than ski boots by comparison.|$|R
50|$|After {{a five-year}} {{research}} project, the SX series of ski <b>boots</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced in the}} beginning of the 1980s. The <b>boot</b> <b>was</b> the result of collaboration with the French designer Roger Tallon.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} aspect of mountaineering <b>boots</b> <b>is</b> warmth. To prevent frostbite in extreme cold conditions, synthetic insulation is incorporated into the boot. Lighter weight <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> classified as single boots. These single <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> insulated as a single unit with the insulation being permanently attached {{to the rest of}} the boot. Double boots, another classification, typically consist of a non-insulated leather or plastic outer shell with a removable insulated liner. The purpose of a double <b>boot</b> <b>is</b> long-term protection from cold weather. If the liner becomes wet, it can be removed from the shell and dried inside a sleeping bag. Since the insulation cannot be removed from single <b>boots,</b> they <b>are</b> not ideally suited for multi-day cold weather excursions.|$|R
25|$|Modern craftswomen weave and {{embroider}} traditional garments that command {{very high}} prices. In winter the skins of animals were worn, with leggings of deerskin and in Sakhalin, <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> {{made from the}} skin of dogs or salmon. Ainu culture considers earrings, traditionally made from grapevines, to be gender neutral. Women also wear a beaded necklace called a tamasay.|$|E
25|$|The women's {{shoes of}} the early Victorian period were narrow and heelless, in black or white satin. By 1850s and 1860s, they were {{slightly}} broader with a low heel and made of leather or cloth. Ankle-length laced or buttoned <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> also popular. From the 1870s to the twentieth century, heels grew higher and toes more pointed. Low-cut pumps were worn for the evening.|$|E
25|$|Original {{engineer}} <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> {{almost always}} black in color. The toes were bulbous and the soles {{were made of}} thick leather. The heels were about one-and-three-quarter inches in height with a slight forward slant, with the edges being concave. Some were customized with studded straps or with cleats. Modern engineer boots vary in toe shape, heel height, sole material, or {{in the use of}} steel reinforcements.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boot</b> fetishism <b>is</b> {{a sexual}} fetish focused on boots. Boots {{have become the}} object of sexual {{attraction}} amounting to fetishism for some people and they have become a standard accessory in BDSM scenes (where leather, latex and PVC <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> favoured) and a fashion accessory in music videos. <b>Boots</b> <b>are</b> seen as perhaps the most fetishistic of all footwear and <b>boots</b> may <b>be</b> the most popular fetish clothing attire.|$|R
5000|$|The Hypervenom Phantom was {{released}} in May 2013. The <b>boot</b> <b>was</b> first known through a Nike commercial [...] "Nike Hypervenom - Deadly Breed". Later on, more commercials will be made starring Neymar in which the video is counting down to the released date of the Hypervenoms. The <b>boot</b> <b>are</b> advertised to be for [...] "fit, touch and traction". The <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> originally released in the black/bright citrus colourway.|$|R
50|$|Several {{styles of}} wetsuit <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} used for kayaking. Short-cut <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> frequently used in warmer conditions where the boots help give grip and foot protection while launching and portaging. In cold conditions longer wetsuit <b>boots</b> may <b>be</b> {{used with a}} drysuit where they are worn over the rubber drysuit socks.|$|R
25|$|Low-heeled {{leather shoes}} {{fastened}} with buckles were worn with silk or woollen stockings. <b>Boots</b> <b>were</b> worn for riding. The buckles were either polished metal, usually in silver (sometimes with the metal cut into false stones in the Paris style), or with paste stones, {{although there were}} other types. These buckles were often quite large {{and one of the}} world's largest collections can be seen at Kenwood House.|$|E
25|$|Service uniform (Dienstuniform) – The summer service uniform for {{officers}} was a bloused jacket, {{called a}} Hemdbluse, worn without a shirt, trousers, and a visored service cap. The winter service uniform featured a tunic with four large buttoned-down patch pockets, a black waist belt, the service cap, breeches, shirt, tie, and pants belt; high <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> reserved for officers and NCOs. A long, heavy, belted greatcoat was {{also part of}} the winter uniform.|$|E
25|$|Fish-skin boots (amirak ~ amiraq sg amiriik dual in Yup'ik and Cup'ik) are {{waterproof}} skin boot made of fish skin. In {{the past}} fish-skin <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> made with depilated soles of bearded seal, ankle straps, and a casing sewb {{to the upper}} edge of the leg. Large salmon skins were prepared for boots by sewing up the fin holes. A round needle was used because a triangular needle would split the skin.|$|E
50|$|Rossi <b>Boots</b> <b>is</b> an Australian work boot company. Rossi employs 75 {{staff in}} the Adelaide suburb of Hilton, making it Australia's second largest work boots company. All Rossi <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> made in Australia in their Hilton factory.|$|R
5000|$|Firefighter turnout <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> usually sized as {{a regular}} shoe, but are made of rubber or leather with a Boron Steel toe insert. The <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> slipped inside {{the legs of the}} {{trousers}} to maintain a barrier from the heat given off by the fire. When the trousers and <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> not being actively used, the trousers will fold down and out around the shins of the boots, ready for quick access for the firefighter. Due to the enormous amounts of potential hazards at a fire scene to the feet, turnout <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> required {{to be able to handle}} a variety of different burns and blows. All <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> required to be outfitted with safety toes and a puncture-resistant midsole plate to prevent puncture from sharp objects that may be stepped on. Such emphasis on the midsole plate is made that IFSTA has deemed that “if there is doubt about midsole protection, should go as far as to x-ray the boot.” ...|$|R
50|$|What is {{the origin}} of the Bootmakers name? In The Hound of the Baskervilles, one of the best-known Sherlock Holmes adventures, a <b>boot</b> <b>is</b> stolen from Sir Henry Baskerville. Readers learn that scent from the <b>boot</b> <b>was</b> {{intended}} to let a fierce hound to track and kill Sir Henry. In the story the <b>boot</b> <b>was</b> fashioned in Toronto by a bootmaker named Meyers. So the society is named The Bootmakers of Toronto and each year the leader of the society is called Meyers.|$|R
25|$|Children's {{clothing}} (mikelnguut aturait) {{was made}} of soft skin of younger animals. Reindeer fawn and dog puppy skin parkas, with the fur inside, were made for babies (irniaq) and small children (mikelnguq). Puppies one and two months old were killed for the purpose. Fawn and puppy skins were turned inside out, scraped, hung out to dry, and then put away. When needed the skins were taken from storage, rubbed between the hands with a rotary motion, and chewed as necessary to soften and loosen tissue that had not previously been removed. For a sealskin parka, one skin was required for a three-year-old, two for a five- or six-year-old, and three for a child of 10 or 12 years. A small child's sealskin parka was often decorated with tassels of the same material stitched to the upper center of the back. A baby's <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> always made with the fur inside but otherwise were similar in construction to adult boots. In former times, babies wore long boots and no pants. When a child was toilet trained, pants separate from <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> put on a boy, while girls were given trouser-boots like those worn by women.|$|E
25|$|Poundland may {{sometimes}} find they are competing with other retailers' own brand produce. It {{was reported in}} May 2010 that Poundland were selling rebranded lotions for £1, exactly the same product that <b>Boots</b> <b>were</b> selling under their own brand for significantly more. Boots responded to the findings by suggesting that the products available in Poundland stores were likely excess stock they had sold off below cost price which had been destined for overseas markets, with some inadvertently directed into UK distribution without their permission.|$|E
25|$|Being {{one of many}} {{clothing}} {{products made}} from animal skin, the production of sheepskin boots {{has been the subject}} of criticism by the animal rights movement with producers responding by improving animal welfare. Animal rights groups call for the boycott of sheepskin boots and their replacement with synthetic alternatives. In 2007, Pamela Anderson, realizing that the <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> made of skin, called for a boycott on her website. In February 2008, the Princeton Animal Welfare Society staged a campus protest against the fur industry, particularly attacking the sheepskin boot industry.|$|E
50|$|A Beatle <b>boot</b> <b>is</b> a {{style of}} <b>boot</b> that has <b>been</b> worn since the 1960s made popular by the English rock group the Beatles, for whom they were {{originally}} made. The <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> {{a variant of the}} Chelsea boot: they are tight-fitting, Cuban-heeled, ankle-high boots with a sharp pointed toe. The style can feature either elastic or zipped sides.|$|R
5000|$|Tanker <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> {{military}} <b>boots</b> {{closely associated}} with soldiers who serve on tanks and tracked vehicles in general. It is said the idea was borrowed from the French crewmen encountered during World War I when then-Captain George S. Patton, Jr. established the United States Tank Corps. Whereas regular combat <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> laced through metal eyelets in the leather upper, the tanker <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> fastened with leather straps which wrap around the upper and buckle near the top.
