40|$|Dry {{friction}} dampers {{are widely}} used to reduce vibration. The forced vibration response of a simplified turbine blade with {{a new kind of}} under-platform dry friction dampers is studied in this paper. The model consists of a clamped blade as two rigidly connected beams and two dampers in the form of masses which are allowed to slide along the <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> in the horizontal direction and vibrate with the <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> in the vertical direction. The horizontal and vertical vibrations of the two dampers, and the horizontal and transverse platform vibrations are coupled by friction at the contact interfaces which is assumed to follow the classical discontinuous Coulomb’s law of friction. The vertical motion of the dampers leads to time-varying contact forces and can cause horizontal stick-slip motion between the contact surfaces. Due to the relative horizontal motion between the dampers and the <b>blade</b> <b>platform,</b> the vertical contact forces and the resultant friction forces act as moving loads. The Finite Element (FE) method and Modal Superposition (MS) method are applied to solve the dynamic response, together with an algorithm that can capture nonsmooth transitions from stick to slip and slip to stick. Quasi-periodic vibration is found even under harmonic excitation...|$|E
40|$|WO 2009098106 A 1 UPAB: 20090824 NOVELTY - The {{heating loop}} (41) {{used in the}} new turbine blade heating unit is seen to be {{generally}} U-shaped, with intentional additional curvatures. Its arrangement is such that a temperature gradient is produced in the fin section of the turbine blade (406). The loop (41) is run close to the blade, {{above and below the}} <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> (403). Above the platform (403) the loop is run near the blade and is curved to correspond with the blade curvature. The loop is curved below the <b>blade</b> <b>platform,</b> especially in correspondence with the turbine blade curvature above the <b>blade</b> <b>platform.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Only a single heating loop is used. It is led near the <b>blade</b> <b>platform.</b> It is passed near the turbine blade or the blade root. The heating loop is arranged on the suction- and/or pressure side of the blade. The heating unit forms part of welding equipment for a turbine blade. In the new method of welding, the heating unit is used in conjunction with welding equipment (49), especially a laser, to produce a weld seam. Welding is carried out {{on the side of the}} turbine blade where the heating loop runs below the <b>blade</b> <b>platform.</b> The weld seam is intentionally allowed to harden to a DS- or SX-orientated structure. The transition region between turbine blade and platform is welded. In the region to be heated, a powder is coated-on. This is a magnetic powder, especially a magnetic and dielectric powder. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the corresponding welding method. USE - A heating unit used when e. g. welding cracks in turbine blades or removing material from them. ADVANTAGE - Turbine blade welding e. g. re-melts and fuses cracks together, or removes material. Pre-heating precedes welding, to reduce thermally-induced stressing. In prior art, the desired temperature or temperature distribution is not achieved. The new equipment and measures described are used to overcome this problem. Use of only a single heating loop is preferred, since it represents an easily-reproducible arrangement. The magnetic and dielectric powder acts as a concentrator for the heating loop, during the heating operation. Its use masks selectively against welding. The blade is used in e. g. an aviation- or power generation gas turbine, a steam turbine or a compressor. Suitable alloys and structure are also discussed in the disclosure...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{gas turbine}} engines require higher turbine-entry gas {{temperature}} {{to improve their}} thermal efficiency and thereby their performance. A major accompanying concern is the heat-up of the turbine components which are already subject to high thermal and mechanical stresses. This heat-up can be reduced by: (i) applying thermal barrier coating (TBC) on the surface, and (ii) providing coolant to the surface by injecting secondary air discharged from the compressor. However, as the bleeding off of compressor discharge air exacts a penalty on engine performance, the cooling functions must be accomplished with the smallest possible secondary air injection. This necessitates a detailed and systematic study of the various flow and geometrical parameters that may have a bearing on the cooling pattern. In the present study, experiments were performed in three regions of a non-rotating gas turbine blade cascade: <b>blade</b> <b>platform,</b> blade span, and blade tip. The <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> and blade span {{studies were carried out}} on a high pressure turbine rotor blade cascade in medium flow conditions. Film-cooling effectiveness or degree of cooling was assessed in terms of cooling hole geometry, blowing ratio, freestream turbulence, coolant-to-mainstream density ratio, purge flow rate, upstream vortex for <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> cooling and blowing ratio, and upstream vortex for blade span cooling. The blade tip study was performed in a blow-down flow loop in a transonic flow environment. The degree of cooling was assessed in terms of blowing ratio and tip clearance. Limited heat transfer coefficient measurements were also carried out. Mainstream pressure loss was also measured for <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> and blade tip film-cooling with the help of pitot-static probes. The pressure sensitive paint (PSP) and temperature sensitive paint (TSP) techniques were used for measuring film-cooling effectiveness whereas for heat transfer coefficient measurement, temperature sensitive paint (TSP) technique was employed. Results indicated that the <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> cooling requires a combination of upstream purge flow and downstream discrete film-cooling holes to cool the entire platform. The shaped cooling holes provided wider film coverage and higher film-cooling effectiveness than the cylindrical holes while also creating lesser mainstream pressure losses. Higher coolant-to-mainstream density ratio resulted in higher effectiveness levels from the cooling holes. On the blade span, at any given blowing ratio, the suction side showed better coolant coverage than the pressure side even though the former had two fewer rows of holes. Film-cooling effectiveness increased with blowing ratio {{on both sides of the}} blade. Whereas the pressure side effectiveness continued to increase with blowing ratio, the increase in suction side effectiveness slowed down at higher blowing ratios (M= 0. 9 and 1. 2). Upstream wake had a detrimental effect on film coverage. 0 % and 25 % wake phase positions significantly decreased film-cooling effectiveness magnitude. Comparison between the compound shaped hole and the compound cylindrical hole design showed higher effectiveness values for shaped holes on the suction side. The cylindrical holes performed marginally better in the curved portion of the pressure side. Finally, the concept tip proved to be better than the baseline tip in terms of reducing mainstream flow leakage and mainstream pressure loss. The film-cooling effectiveness on the concept blade increased with increasing blowing ratio and tip gap. However, the film-coverage on the leading tip portion was almost negligible...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the asymmetry of thermal conditions during directional solidification, the temperature evolution and correspondingly developed undercooling in a simplified single crystal blade cluster were numerically simulated. Simulation results demonstrate that the temperature distribution at the <b>blade</b> <b>platforms</b> is obviously asymmetrical. On {{the outside of the}} blade which directly faces the heating element, the liquidus (TL) isotherms progress relatively smoothly. On the inside of the blades facing the central rod, however, the TL-isotherms are in concave shape and the slope goes upwards to the platform extremities. The average undercooling extent ΔT and undercooling time Δt at the inside are much higher than those at the outside. It was then predicted that the inside platform extremities have significantly higher probabilities of stray grain formation compared to the outside ones. A corresponding experiment was carried out and the metallographic examination exhibited the same side- and height-dependence of stray grain formation in the blades as predicted.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation to}} measure the effect of mainstream turbulence on <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> cooling effectiveness within a linear cascade has been completed. Turbulence grids generate the wide ranges of turbulence intensity, from 0. 72 % to 13 %. To simulate the rotating condition of engine blades, velocity triangle analogy has been adopted. Different size of inclined injection hole plates produces swirl motion of purge flow, which makes three different swirl ratios of 0. 4, 0. 6 and 1. 0.

Horseshoe vortex and passage vortex sweep coolant remarkably, which results in poor film cooling coverage on the blade. Furthermore, {{the strength of the}} two vortexes increases for higher rotating conditions.

40|$|During the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSM) HPFtP/AT {{development}} program, engine hot fire testing {{resulted in}} turbine blade fatigue cracks. The cracks were noted {{after only a}} few tests and a several hundred seconds versus the design goal of 60 tests and > 30, 000 seconds. Subsequent investigation attributed the distress to excessive steady and dynamic loads. To address these excessive turbine blade loads, Pratt & Whitney Liquid Space Propulsion engineers designed and developed retrofitable turbine blade to <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> featherseal dampers. Since incorporation of these dampers, along with other turbine blade system improvements, there has been no observed SSME HPFTP/AT turbine blade fatigue cracking. The high time HPFTP/AT blade now has accumulated 32 starts and 19, 200 seconds hot fire test time. Figure # 1 illustrates the HPFTP/AT turbine <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> featherseal dampers. The approached selected was to improve the turbine blade structural capability while simultaneously reducing loads. To achieve this goal, the featherseal dampers were designed to seal the blade to <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> gap and damp the dynamic motions. Sealing improves the steady stress margins by increasing turbine efficiency and improving turbine blade attachment thermal conditioning. Load reduction was achieved through damping. Thin Haynes 188 sheet metal was selected based on its material properties (hydrogen resistance, elongation, tensile strengths, etc.). The 36, 000 rpm wheel speed of the rotor result in a normal load of 120 #/blade. The featherseals then act as micro-slip dampers during actual SSME operation. After initial design and analysis (prior to full engine testing), the featherseal dampers were tested in P&W's spin rig facility in West Palm Beach, Florida. Both dynamic strain gages and turbine blade tip displacement measurements were utilized to quantify the featherseal damper effectiveness. Full speed (36, 000 rpm), room temperature rig testing verified the elimination of fundamental mode (i. e, modes 1 & 2) resonant response. The reduction in turbine blade dynamic response is shown for a typical turbine blade. This paper discusses the design and verification of these dampers. The numerous benefits associated with this design concept warrants consideration in existing and future turbomachinery applications...|$|E
40|$|Friction damping {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{exploited}} systems of passive control of the vibration of mechanical systems. In order to mitigate vibration of turbine blades, friction dampers are commonly included in the bladed disk design. A common type of blade-to-blade friction dampers are the so-called underplatform dampers (UPDs); these are metal devices placed under the <b>blade</b> <b>platforms</b> and held in contact with them by the centrifugal force acting during rotation. The effectiveness of UPDs to dissipate energy by friction and reduce vibration amplitude depends mostly on the damper geometry and material and on the static loads pressing the damper against the <b>blade</b> <b>platforms.</b> The common procedure used to estimate the static loads acting on UPDs consists in decoupling the static and the dynamic balance of the damper. A preliminary static analysis of the contact is performed in order to compute the static pressure distribution over the damper/blade interfaces, assuming that it does not change when vibration occurs. In this paper a coupled approach is proposed. The static and the dynamic displacements of blade and UPD are coupled together during the forced response calculation. Both the primary structure (the bladed disk) and the secondary structure (the damper) are modeled by finite elements and linked together by contact elements, allowing for stick, slip and lift off states, placed between each pair of contact nodes, by using a refined version of the state-of-the-art friction contact model. In order to model accurately the blade/damper contact with a large number of contact nodes without increasing proportionally the size of the set of nonlinear equations to be solved, damper and blade dynamics are modeled by linear superposition of a truncated series of normal modes. The proposed method is applied to a bladed disk under cyclic symmetric boundary conditions in order to show the capabilities of the method compared to the classical decoupled approache...|$|R

Film cooling effectiveness distributions were obtained on a turbine <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> within a linear cascade with upstream slot injection. The width of the slot was varied as well as the mass flow rate of the injected coolant. Obstacles were placed upstream to model the effect of the upstream vane.

The width of the opening of this seal was varied to simulate the effect of misalignment. Stationary rods were placed upstream of the cascade in four phase locations to model the unsteady wake formed at the trailing edge of the upstream vane. Delta wings were also placed in four positions to create a vortex similar to the passage vortex at the exit of the vane. The film cooling effectiveness distributions were measured using pressure-sensitive paint (PSP).

The fluid velocity field, temperature field and cooling curves of the single and multiple turbine blades during gas fan quenching were also simulated. Modeling results indicate that the loading tray, free outlet and the location of turbine blades have important influences on the flow field. The high-speed gas flows out from the nozzle is divided by loading tray, and the free outlet enhanced the two vortex flow {{at the end of the}} furnace door. The closer the blade is to the exhaust outlet and the nozzle, the greater the flow velocity is and the more adequate the flow is. The blade geometry has an effect on the cooling for single blade and multiple blades during gas fan quenching, and the effects in double layers differs from that in single layer. For single blade, the cooing rate at thin-walled part is lower than that at thick-walled part, the cooling rate at sharp corner is greater than that at tenon and <b>blade</b> <b>platform,</b> and the temperature at regions close to the internal position is decreased more slowly than that close to the surface. For multiple blades in single layer, the temperature at sharp corner or thin wall in the blade that close to the nozzles is much lower, and the temperature distribution of blades is almost parallel. The cooling rate inside the air current channel is lower than that of at the position near <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> and tenon, and the effect of blade location to the nozzles on the temperature field inside the blade is lower than that on the blade surface. For multiple blades in double layers, the flow velocity is low, and the flow is not uniform for blades in the second-layer due to the shielding of blades in the first-layer. the cooling rate of blades in the second-layer is lower than that in the first-layer. The cooling rate of blade close to the nozzles in the first-layer is the higher than that of blade away from the nozzles in the second-layer, and the temperature distribution on blades in the same layer is almost parallel. The cooling rate in thin wall position of blade away from the nozzles is larger than that in tenon of the blade closer to the nozzles in the same layer. The cooling rate for blades in the second-layer is much lower both in thin wall and tenon for blades away from the nozzles...|$|E
40|$|The Sony-Toshiba-IBM Cell Broadband Engine is a {{heterogeneous}} multicore architecture {{that consists of}} a traditional microprocessor (PPE) with eight SIMD coprocessing units (SPEs) integrated on-chip. While the Cell/B. E. processor is designed with multimedia applications in mind, there are currently no open-source, optimized implementations of such applications available. In this paper, we present the design and implementation behind {{the creation of an}} optimized MPEG- 2 software decoder for this unique parallel architecture, and demonstrate its performance through an experimental study. This is the first parallelization of an MPEG- 2 decoder for a commodity heterogeneous multicore processor such as the IBM Cell/B. E. While Drake et al. have recently parallelized MPEG- 2 using StreamIt for a streaming architecture, our algorithm is quite different and is the first to address the new challenges related to the optimization and tuning of a multicore algorithm with DMA transfers and local store memory. Our design and efficient implementation target the architectural features provided by the heterogeneous multicore processor. We give an experimental study on Sony PlayStation 3 and IBM QS 20 dual-Cell <b>Blade</b> <b>platforms.</b> For instance, using 16 SPEs on the IBM QS 20, our decoder runs 3. 088 times faster than a 3. 2 GHz Intel Xeon and achieves a speedup of over 10. 545 compared with a PPE-only implementation. Our source code is freelyavailable through SourceForge under the CellBuzz project. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work {{procedural}} fundamentals are {{developed for the}} laser remelting of single crystal turbine blades made from the nickel-base superalloy PWA 1483. Such a process aims to remove cracks in the surface layer by maintaining the single crystal structure. Single crystal repair using laser remelting requires controlled solidification conditions {{in order to prevent}} nucleation and growth of spurious grains ahead of the columnar dendritic front, i. e. to ensure epitaxial growth and to prevent the columnar to equiaxed transition. The development of the procedural fundamentals is subdivided into three steps. A laser remelting process is first developed on flat sample geometries. A process window is determined by varying all relevant process parameters. By maintaining the single crystal structure, a remelted depth up to 1. 2 mm is reached in the surface layer. The development of an overlapping strategy is used to remelt whole areas and to achieve a homogeneous remelted depth. In addition investigations are carried out to measure the emitted temperature radiation on the surface in the melt pool. In comparison to the experimental process development, heat conduction calculations based on the finite element method are carried out to determine the solidification conditions (temperature gradient, solidification velocity) and the temperature field within the melt pool. The experimental and calculated results are compared with results from previous literature. The first step is completed by remelting artificial cracks and maintaining the single crystal structure. In the second step, the developed process is transferred to complex samples with changing material thickness and curved surfaces. The measurement of the emitted temperature radiation of the surface of the melt pool is used to implement a temperature control. By using this control a nearly constant remelted depth of zm = 1 mm  0. 1 mm is achieved along the remelted track. This means that the deviation in remelted depth is decreased in comparison to laser remelting with a constant laser power. In the third step, the process is successfully applied to remelt different areas on turbine <b>blades</b> (<b>platform,</b> <b>blade,</b> fillet) without cracking...|$|R
40|$|All {{numerical}} {{models of}} friction-damped bladed arrays require knowledge or information of contact-friction parameters. In the literature, these parameters are typically tuned {{so that the}} experimental Frequency Response Function (FRF) of a damped blade matches its numerical counterpart. It {{is well known that}} there exist multiple combinations of contact parameters capable of satisfying a given experimental-numerical FRF match. A better approach towards a finer tuning could be based on directly measuring contact forces transmitted between <b>blade</b> <b>platforms</b> through the damper: in this case friction coefficients are estimated through tangential over normal force components during those hysteresis segments which are safely identified as being in a slip condition. This has been applied by these authors to rigid bar (solid) dampers. Unfortunately, the four contact stiffness values (left and right damper-platform contact, normal and tangential) are more than the measurements available in the technique presentedby these authors. Therefore, the problem is underdetermined. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold, i. e., to propose an alternative way to estimate contact stiffness values (i. e. thus solving the under-determinacy mentioned above) and to check the effective significance of such estimates from a practical engineering point of view. The contact parameter estimation technique proposed by these authors produces, for each contact parameter, a best-fit value and an uncertainty band. It will be shown that the uncertainty affecting each contact parameter results in an uncertainty on the equivalent damping and stiffness indicators at blade level which is lower than 5 %...|$|R
