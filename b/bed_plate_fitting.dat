A <b>bed</b> <b>plate</b> and hub for the NOWITECH 10 MW reference turbine has been analyzed, according to IEC 61400. The work is based on Ebbe Smith's thesis about <b>bed</b> <b>plate</b> design, and Mohammad Akram Khan's thesis about rotor shaft and rotor hub design. A completely new <b>bed</b> <b>plate</b> has been designed, and analyzed with more correct boundary conditions including a yaw bearing with contact surfaces and bolt connections between flanges.

40|$|NOWITECH (Norwegian Research Centre for Offshore Technology) are {{developing}} a 10 MW offshore reference wind turbine to encourage increased production of renewable energy. This thesis present a mechanical design and dimensioning of a transition piece between the yaw bearing (part of the nacelle) and the tower in this reference turbine. A fatigue analysis to verify the lifetime of 20 years for the main shaft, <b>bed</b> <b>plate</b> and transition piece has also been performed. The final design has shape like a cone, which distributes the loads from the yaw bearing to the whole section of each tower leg. An extreme load case with 50 year occurrence period {{has been used for}} the Ultimate Limit State analysis. The material EN-GJS- 400 - 18 is suggested for the transition piece, <b>bed</b> <b>plate</b> and main shaft. It has a yield strength of 240 MPa and a tensile strength of 370 MPa. The mass of the transition piece is 49. 6 tonnes and a peak stress of 262 MPa in a single node was found. This is further discussed in chapter 12. 3 and 18. The fatigue analysis was calculated with a detailed assessment described in the European standard, EN 13445 - 6 together with IEC 61400. The load case was calculated from a memo with fatigue loads for power production. A static analysis in the software NX/Nastran was performed with conservative estimations.

5000|$|Another {{significant}} {{advantage of}} IQF technology {{is its ability}} to separate the products during the freezing process, which results in products of higher quality when compared to those which are block frozen for example. This advantage is also important for food sustainability as it allows the defrost and use of the exact needed quantity as opposed to defrosting a bigger block and dispose of the unneeded or unused portion. There is a range of IQF technologies, but the main concept is to transport the product into the freezer {{with the help of a}} processing line belt or infeed shaker. Inside the freezer the product travels through the freezing zone and comes out on the other side. The transportation of the product inside the freezer can be achieved through different technologies depending on the IQF freezer’s brand. There are solutions based on transportation belts inside the freezer which is similar to a conveyor belt. Other latest innovations include <b>bed</b> <b>plates</b> on which the product lands and an asymmetrical movement is used for making the product advance by itself in the freezer.|$|R

50|$|For the {{composition}} of the flammable material used in a carcass, 18th century philosopher Christian Wolff prescribed 10 parts of pounded gunpowder, 2 of nitre, 1 of sulfur, and 1 of colophony; or 6 of gunpowder, 4 of nitre, 4 of sulfur, 1 of beaten glass, 0.5 of antimony 0.5 of camphor, 1 of sal armoniac, and 0.25 of common salt.

The internal shell's aperture was then plugged up, and it was immersed in a mixture of 4 parts of melted pitch, 20 of rosin, 1 of oil of turpentine, and as much ground gunpowder as was needed to reduce it to the consistency of a paste. After immersion, the shell was to be covered with tow, and immersed again, until it was the proper size for the mortar.|$|R

40|$|Through-thickness {{microstructure}} {{and mechanical}} property of AA 7055 -T 7751 aluminum alloy plate were investigated by using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), {{transmission electron microscope}} (TEM) and small angle X-ray scattering(SAXS). The results indicate an inhomogeneous distribution of microstructure through the thickness. The degree of recrystallization decreases gradually from 69 % to 19. 1 %, as deepening from the surface {{to the center of}} the plate. The size of subgrains decreases from 10 μm at the surface to around 2 μm at the center. Strong texture of rolling type is observed near the center but the intensity decreases gradually as nearing the surface and the shear texture becomes the dominant. High density of plate-like η' phases are observed in the alloy, indicating the sufficient precipitation. η' precipitates of this condition are around 3. 7 nm in radius, 1 - 3 nm in thickness and are found coherent with the Al matrix with a coherent strain of 0. 0133, showing a strong strengthening effect. The heterogeneity in grain scale does not influence the distribution and the morphology of precipitates. The yield strength (L direction) varies linearly along the thickness direction of the <b>plate,</b> <b>fitting</b> an equation of σ y =- 38. 7 S + 604. 8 (0 ≤ S ≤ 1).

40|$|The order Parmales (Heterokontophyta) is a {{group of}} small-sized {{unicellular}} marine phytoplankton, which is distributed widely from tropical to polar waters. The cells of Parmales are surrounded by a distinctive cell wall, which consists of several siliceous <b>plates</b> <b>fitting</b> edge to edge. Phylogenetic and morphological analyses suggest that Parmales {{is one of the key}} organisms for elucidating the evolutionary origin of Bacillariophyceae (diatoms), the most successful heterokontophyta. The effects of silicon-limitation on growth and morphogenesis of plates were studied using a strain of Triparma laevis NIES- 2565, which was cultured for the first time in artificial sea water. The cells of T. laevis were surrounded by eight plates when grown with sufficient silicon. However, plate formation became incomplete when cells were cultured in a medium containing low silicate (ca. < 10 µM). Cells finally lost almost all plates in a medium containing silicate concentrations lower than ca. 1 µM. However, silicon-limitation did not affect growth rate; cells continued to divide without changing their growth rate, even after all plates were lost. Loss of plates was reversible; when cells without plates were transferred to a medium containing sufficient silicate, regeneration of shield and ventral plates was followed by the formation of girdle and triradiate plates. The results indicate that the response to silicon-limitation of T. laevis is different from that of diatoms, where cell division becomes inhibited under such conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the effect of turbulence intensity on frazil formation and evolution a series of experiments were undertaken at the Hydraulics Research & Testing Facility in the University of Manitoba using a counter-rotating flume. Five sets of <b>bed</b> <b>plates</b> ranging in roughness from roughened PVC to 20 mm gravel were used to generate turbulence in the flume. Velocity measurements were made using a constant temperature anemometer with a conical hot-film probe. The ability to rotate the flume walls at any given rate enabled the researchers to perform experiments where the average velocity was kept virtually constant, while the turbulence intensity increased with increasing bed roughness. Measurements of water and air temperature as well as digital images taken during ice formation were analyzed. It was found that although turbulence intensity seemed to have an effect on several of the key features of a supercooling curve, the relationships were not particularly strong. The most significant finding is the mean diameter and standard deviation of the frazil disks seem to reach nearly constant values after several minutes of supercooling, and that these values were strongly affected by turbulence intensity. In addition, it is hypothesized that a power-law relationship could describe the variation of the mean diameter and standard deviation with time...|$|R
40|$|The {{processes}} of secondary nucleation and flocculation of frazil ice are relatively poorly understood. In {{order to better}} understand the effect that turbulence intensity has on these processes, a series of experiments were undertaken at the Hydraulics Research & Testing Facility in the University of Manitoba using a counter-rotating flume. Five sets of <b>bed</b> <b>plates</b> ranging in roughness from smooth PVC to 20 mm gravel were used to generate the turbulence in the flume. Velocity measurements in open water were made using a constant temperature anemometer with a conical hot-film probe. The ability to rotate the flume walls at any given rate enabled the researchers to perform experiments where the average velocity was kept constant, while the turbulence intensity increased with increasing bed roughness. Measurements of water temperature, air temperature, and digital images taken during ice formation were analyzed. It was found that the rate of secondary nucleation increased with increasing turbulence intensity, however, the trend was not well defined. A multiple linear regression model using turbulence intensity in addition to the maximum degree of supercooling as the two independent variables was found to reasonably model the rate of secondary nucleation. Initial results demonstrate that turbulence intensity increases the uniformity of the vertical distribution of frazil particles and tends to inhibit frazil flocculation. 1...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic energy {{dissipation}} within a jigging cycle has been mechanically analyzed using data {{developed in a}} highly instrumented and controlled pilot scale Baum jig. The analysis {{is based on the}} use of the energy and momentum equations for the fluid. It was found that energy balances on the water in the jig failed to close because of elastic deformation of the jig body, rather than inaccuracies in the measurement techniques or failure to account for heat transfer. This deformation problem appears to be common in either pilot jigs or commercial jigs. An empirical means of correcting the energy balance was devised and applied to the data with some success. Using this compensation method, the energy balance was improved. The likely energy balance indicates that (i) less than 7 % of the energy of the incoming compressed air is expended in the jig system, (ii) less than 5 % of the energy from the compressed air is actually dissipated in the jig bed, (iii) the kinetic energy input from the hutch water supply is effectively negligible, in comparison to the energy input from the compressed air, and (iv) about 2. 5 - 3. 7 % of the energy from compressed air is dissipated around the <b>bed</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{operation}} of the closure valve was to be critical:Along the upper surface of the pipe is a continuous slit or groove about two inches wide. This groove is covered by a valve, extending the whole length of the railway, formed of a strip of leather riveted between iron plates, the top plates being wider than the groove and serving to prevent the external air forcing the leather into the pipe when the vacuum is formed within it; and the lower <b>plates</b> <b>fitting</b> into the groove when the valve is shut, makes up the circle of the pipe, and prevents the air from passing the piston; one edge of this valve is securely held down by iron bars, fastened by screw bolts to a longitudinal rib cast on the pipe, and allows the leather between the plates and the bar {{to act as a}} hinge, similar to a common pump valve; the other edge of the valve falls into a groove which contains a composition of beeswax and tallow: this composition is solid at the temperature of the atmosphere, and becomes fluid when heated a few degrees above it. Over this valve is a protecting cover, which serves to preserve it from snow or rain, formed of thin plates of iron about five feet long hinged with leather, and the end of each plate underlaps the next {{in the direction of the}} piston's motion, thus ensuring the lifting of each in succession.|$|R
50|$|A {{new company}} {{was formed in}} 1912 and the mine reopened after many years. A Victorian mine manager, David Morgan, was {{appointed}} as the new Tyrconnel mine manager. By early 1913 they had the winding gear and ore bins erected. The owners bought the Great Dyke Company's ten head battery at Caledonia Creek near Thornborough. T. Harley, engineer-in-charge, had the contract for £80 to transport the battery to its new position. Their first twelve weeks of crushings from the mine were impressive yielding 1,041 ounces of gold from 945 tons of stone (sent out to another battery for crushing). They installed a compressor in July 1913 and rock drills in September. In October they struck a reef almost 2.4 m wide which offered two to three ounce gold quartz. The mine shaft was then put in order in November for skips. By then the battery was almost ready and the headframe was being put in position. They also had a suction gas engine sitting at Dimbulah awaiting transport to the Hodgkinson. The battery started crushing in February 1914 but broke down in May because the engine <b>bed</b> <b>plate</b> broke.
