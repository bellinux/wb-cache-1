40|$|Basket weaving: the {{euromarket}} {{experience with}} basket currency bonds 2 ECU-denominated international bonds owed {{much of their}} limited success in the 1980 s and 1990 s to restrictions on the internationalisation of the Deutsche mark and to speculative investment, rather than simply to the benefits of diversification. <b>Basket</b> <b>bond</b> issuance may come {{at the cost of}} a less liquid domestic bond market. JEL classification: E 42, E 58, F 02, F 31, F 33, F 36, G 15. Asian policymakers have given priority to developing domestic bond markets. The Asian financial crisis of 1997 – 98 suggested that more developed local bond markets could have limited risky mismatches between foreign currency liabilities and home currency assets. Since the crisis, central banks have also agreed to a network of swap arrangements to prevent a recurrence of speculators ’ attacking first one and then another currency. The depegging of the Chinese currency from the US dollar has made concerted exchange rate management possible as a third element in regional cooperation, along with bond market development and foreign exchange reserve sharing. In this context, the eurobond market has been seen as a precedent for regional market development in the service of financial, currency and monetary cooperation. In particular, market participants ’ use of a basket of European currencies that eventually became the euro strikes many as an example worth pursuing in Asia. Leading advocates in Asia include Chaipravat et al (2003) and Ito (2004). 3 The latter links multicurrency bond issuance to prospective management of currencies against a common basket, such as that proposed by...|$|E
40|$|First version: May 20, 2003; This version: December 22, 2003 This {{paper is}} to {{investigate}} {{advantages and disadvantages of}} common currency <b>basket</b> denominated <b>bonds</b> over international currency denominated ones in terms of both foreign exchange risks and liquidity. Our empirical analysis obtained the following results: (i) the currency <b>basket</b> denominated <b>bonds</b> would be able to decrease foreign exchange risks in both borrowing and investment sides; (ii) the US dollar has the highest degree of liquidity for all of the nine East Asian currencies; (iii) both investors and bond issuers face trade-off between foreign exchange risks and liquidity. 21 世紀COEプログラム = 21 st-Century COE Progra...|$|R

Wages paid will be spent immediately in the corporate, profit-making sector. Corporate profit will rise, followed by production and hiring of personnel. GDP will go up, and debt ratios down. The program can be financed by loans from the ECB at 0. 25 %, and subsequently by better taxation, retrieval from tax havens, FTT or European <b>basket</b> <b>bonds.</b> The sum needed is smaller than the stimulus program (2009 -) of the Obama Administration, QE by the FED and BoE, and loans by the ECB to banks...|$|R

50|$|To {{determine}} the cheapest <b>bond</b> in a <b>basket</b> of deliverable <b>bonds</b> against a futures contract, implied repo rate is computed for each bond; the {{bond with the}} highest repo rate is the cheapest. It is the cheapest because it has the lowest initial value to yield a higher return provided it is delivered with the stated futures price.|$|R
40|$|Even if {{the name}} futures {{indicates}} a simple instrument, bond futures are complex. Several special features {{are embedded in}} the instrument. In particular the future is not written on one specific bond but on a <b>basket</b> of <b>bonds,</b> from which the short side can deliver the cheapest. This paper focuses on that feature, present in the main futures market, {{and its impact on}} the futures risk. A formula for the delivery option and the convexity adjustment due to the daily margining is proposed in the Gaussian HJM model. The approach is numerically very efficient and easy to implement. Based on this result a futures option formula is derived. The approach is similar to the one used for Canary swaptions. ...|$|R

40|$|Concrete block {{pavement}} (CBP) {{is distinct}} from typical concrete or asphalt pavements. It is built by using individual blocks with unique construction patterns forming a discrete surface layer to bear traffic loadings. The surface structure of CBP varies depending on the block shapes and construction patterns, so {{it is hard to}} apply a general equivalent elastic modulus estimation method to define the surface structural strength. In this study, FEM analysis and dynamic loading test were carried out to develop a deflection prediction model for CBP considering the block shapes and construction patterns. Based on the analysis results, it was found that block shapes did not have much effect on load distribution, whereas construction patterns did. By applying the deflection prediction model to the rutting model for CBP proposed by Sun, the herringbone bond pattern showed the best performance comparing with stretcher <b>bond</b> or <b>basket</b> weave <b>bond</b> pattern. As the load repetition increased to 1. 2 million, the rutting depth of CBP constructed by herringbone bond pattern was 2 [*]mm smaller than those constructed by the other two patterns...|$|R
40|$|The Chairman’s Statement of the Second East Asian Summit held in January 2007 {{included}} the agreement {{for the study}} of economic integration of participating countries, and for close cooperation in various financial markets to achieve continuous and stable economic development. This paper examines what East Asian financial and capital markets should be {{in the light of the}} analysis of the present situation, and also seeks the possibility of issuance of Asian currency <b>basket</b> denominated <b>bonds</b> as one of the symbolic challenges toward the future. Firstly, even in the case of the recent data (as of the end of 2006) on the I-S balance in the East Asian sovereign and quasi-sovereign states, excess savings further expanded; so there is an urgent need to make effective use of the savings funds for intra-regional investment. Secondly, this paper summarizes the current issues relating to local currency bond markets in East Asian states and cross-border bond markets, which are both expected to play an important role in East Asian financial and capital markets in the future...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the efficiency of}} the Treasury Bond futures market in Australia. We provide a comprehensive explanation of the method used to price, and evaluate efficiency of the 3 and 10 Year Australian Treasury Bond Futures contracts, against underlying <b>bond</b> <b>baskets.</b> Results indicate that the futures contracts exhibit minimal variation from their theoretical value. The average mispricing equates to 1. 96 basis points for 3 Year and 1. 19 basis points for 10 Year government bond futures contracts. However, during some periods (including the financial crisis of 2008), the bond futures contracts exhibit greater mispricing. Consistent with prior literature, we find a decreasing pattern of mispricing towards expiry, with the futures contract yields and average forward yields of the underlying bonds converging towards expiry. Further analysis reveals that volatility and time to expiry exhibit a significant positive relationship with the absolute level of mispricing. 12 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Under {{standard}} assumptions the reduced-form {{credit risk}} model is {{not capable of}} accurately pricing the two fundamental credit risk instruments - bonds and credit default swaps (CDS) - simultaneously. Using a data set of euro-denominated corporate bonds and CDS our paper quantifies this mispricing by calibrating such a model to bond data, and subsequently using it to price CDS, resulting in model CDS spreads up to 50 % lower on average than observed in the market. An extended model is presented which includes the delivery option implicit in CDS contracts emerging since a <b>basket</b> of <b>bonds</b> is deliverable in default. By using a constant recovery rate standard models assume equal recoveries for all bonds and hence zero value for the delivery option. Contradicting this common assumption, case studies of Chapter 11 filings presented in the paper show that corporate bonds do not necessarily trade at equal levels following default. Our extension models the implied expected recovery rate of the cheapest-to-deliver bond and, applied to data, largely eliminates the mispricing. Calibrated recovery values lie between 8 % and 47 % for different obligors, exhibiting strong variation among rating classes and industries. A cross-sectional analysis reveals that the implied recovery parameter depends on proxies for the delivery option, primarily the number of available bonds and bond pricing errors. No evidence is found for a direct influence of the bid-ask spread, notional amount, coupon, or rating used as proxies for bond market liquidity. ...|$|R
40|$|A basket default swap is a {{derivative}} security tied to an underlying <b>basket</b> of corporate <b>bonds</b> or other assets subject to credit risk. The {{value of the}} contract depends on the joint distribution of the default times of the underlying assets. Valuing a basket default swap often entails Monte Carlo simulation of these default times. For baskets of high-quality credits and for swaps that require multiple defaults to trigger payment, pricing the swap is a rareevent simulation problem. Joshi and Kainth (2004) introduced an innovative importance sampling technique for this problem that forces a predetermined number of defaults to occur on each path. This paper analyzes, extends and improves the Joshi-Kainth algorithm. We show that, in its original form, the algorithm can actually increase variance; we present an alternative that is guaranteed to reduce variance, even when defaults are not rare. Along the way, we provide a rigorous underpinning in a setting sufficiently general to include both the original method and the version proposed here. ...|$|R
