25|$|If {{a patient}} with {{epilepsy}} is being considered for resective surgery, it is often necessary to localize the focus (source) of the epileptic brain activity with a resolution greater than what is provided by scalp EEG. This is because the cerebrospinal fluid, skull and scalp smear the electrical potentials recorded by scalp EEG. In these cases, neurosurgeons typically implant strips and grids of electrodes (or penetrating depth electrodes) under the dura mater, through either a craniotomy or a <b>burr</b> <b>hole.</b> The recording of these signals {{is referred to as}} electrocorticography (ECoG), subdural EEG (sdEEG) or intracranial EEG (icEEG)--all terms for the same thing. The signal recorded from ECoG is on a different scale of activity than the brain activity recorded from scalp EEG. Low voltage, high frequency components that cannot be seen easily (or at all) in scalp EEG can be seen clearly in ECoG. Further, smaller electrodes (which cover a smaller parcel of brain surface) allow even lower voltage, faster components of brain activity to be seen. Some clinical sites record from penetrating microelectrodes.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{operation}} for which evidence exists is trepanation (also known as trepanning, trephination, trephining or <b>burr</b> <b>hole</b> from Greek τρύπανον and τρυπανισμός), {{in which a}} hole is drilled or scraped into the skull for exposing the dura mater to treat health problems related to intracranial pressure and other diseases. In the case of head wounds, surgical intervention was implemented for investigating and diagnosing {{the nature of the}} wound and the extent of the impact while bone splinters were removed preferably by scraping followed by post operation procedures and treatments for avoiding infection and aiding in the healing process. Evidence has been found in prehistoric human remains from Proto-Neolithic and Neolithic times, in cave paintings, and the procedure continued in use well into recorded history (being described by ancient Greek writers such as Hippocrates). Out of 120 prehistoric skulls found at one burial site in France dated to 6500 BCE, 40 had trepanation holes. Folke Henschen, a Swedish doctor and historian, asserts that Soviet excavations of the banks of the Dnieper River in the 1970s show the existence of trepanation in Mesolithic times dated to approximately 12000 BCE. The remains suggest a belief that trepanning could cure epileptic seizures, migraines, and certain mental disorders.|$|E
50|$|In the {{multiple}} <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> procedure, multiple small <b>holes</b> (<b>burr</b> <b>holes)</b> {{are placed in}} the skull to allow for growth of new vessels into the brain from the scalp.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{operations}} {{that have been}} developed for the condition, but currently the most favored are the in-direct procedures EDAS, EMS, and multiple <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> and the direct procedure STA-MCA. Direct superficial temporal artery (STA) to middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass is considered the treatment of choice, although its efficacy, particularly for hemorrhagic disease, remains uncertain. Multiple <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> have been used in frontal and parietal lobes with good neovascularisation achieved.|$|R
40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that preservation of nonviable cranial bone is possible in some selected cases in the absence of infection. Methods: A series of ten male patients, mean age 29 ± 7 with severe electrical scalp burns and nonviable cranial bone were managed conservatively. The patients were treated initially by soft-tissue debridement until the wound presented viable, clean margins. At 22 ± 6 days after the burn, multiple <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> were made in the nonviable bone, and the defect immediately covered with a well-vascularized scalp flap. Each patient’s progress was documented during the hospital stay and during the follow-up for at least one year. Results: The multiple <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> filled with fibrous tissue and the contour of the skull was maintained in all 10 patients making the need of a secondary cranioplasty unnecessary. No postoperative infection, osteomyelitis, or cranial bone sequestration occurred. Conclusions: Even with moderately delayed management of contaminated electrical burns, partial excision of the necrotic bone with <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> and flap coverage appear...|$|R
2500|$|Trepanning, {{also known}} as trepanation, trephination, trephining or making a <b>burr</b> <b>hole</b> (the verb trepan derives from Old French via Medieval Latin, from the Greek noun of trypanon, {{literally}} [...] "borer, auger") is a surgical intervention in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the human skull, exposing the dura mater to treat health problems related to intracranial diseases or release pressured blood buildup from an injury. It may also refer to any [...] "burr" [...] hole created through other body surfaces, including nail beds. [...] It {{is often used to}} relieve pressure beneath a surface. [...] A trephine is an instrument used for cutting out a round piece of skull bone.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of an}} {{evaluation}} for epilepsy surgery, {{it may be necessary}} to insert electrodes near the surface of the brain, under the surface of the dura mater. This is accomplished via <b>burr</b> <b>hole</b> or craniotomy. This is referred to variously as [...] "electrocorticography (ECoG)", [...] "intracranial EEG (I-EEG)" [...] or [...] "subdural EEG (SD-EEG)". Depth electrodes may also be placed into brain structures, such as the amygdala or hippocampus, structures, which are common epileptic foci and may not be [...] "seen" [...] clearly by scalp EEG. The electrocorticographic signal is processed in the same manner as digital scalp EEG (above), with a couple of caveats. ECoG is typically recorded at higher sampling rates than scalp EEG because of the requirements of Nyquist theorem—the subdural signal is composed of a higher predominance of higher frequency components. Also, many of the artifacts that affect scalp EEG do not impact ECoG, and therefore display filtering is often not needed.|$|E
2500|$|The narrowness of the {{cerebral}} aqueduct and foramina {{means that they}} can become blocked, for example, by blood following a hemorrhagic stroke. As cerebrospinal fluid is continually produced by the choroid plexus within the ventricles, a blockage of outflow leads to increasingly high pressure in the lateral ventricles. As a consequence, this commonly leads in turn to hydrocephalus. Medically one would call this post-haemorrhagic acquired hydrocephalus, but {{is often referred to}} colloquially by the layperson as [...] "water on the brain". This is an extremely serious condition regardless of the cause of blockage. An endoscopic third ventriculostomy is a surgical procedure for the treatment of hydrocephalus in which an opening is created in the floor of the third ventricle using an endoscope placed within the ventricular system through a <b>burr</b> <b>hole.</b> This allows the cerebrospinal fluid to flow directly to the basal cisterns, thereby shortcutting any obstruction. A surgical [...] procedure to make an entry hole to access any of the ventricles is called a ventriculostomy. This is done to drain accumulated cerebrospinal fluid either through a temporary catheter or a permanent shunt.|$|E
30|$|Skull “pseudolesions” include {{arachnoid}} granulations, prominent venous lakes, hyperostosis frontalis, thinning of the parietal {{bones and}} surgical <b>burr</b> <b>holes.</b> It {{is important to}} recognise these entities, so as to not mistake them for true pathology.|$|R
30|$|All {{surgeries}} {{were done}} under general anesthesia {{with one or}} two coin-sized (about 2  cm in diameter) <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> performed and located according to the operating surgeon’s decision based on the size and configuration of the hematoma.|$|R
25|$|Depending on {{the size}} and deterioration, age of the patient, and {{anaesthetic}} risk posed, subdural hematomas occasionally require craniotomy for evacuation; most frequently, simple <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> for drainage; often conservative treatment; and rarely, palliative treatment in patients of extreme age or with no chance of recovery.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Burr</b> <b>Hole</b> Mounted System: This {{provides}} a {{limited range of}} possible intracranial target points with a fixed entry point. They provided two angular degrees of freedom and a depth adjustment. The surgeon could place the <b>burr</b> <b>hole</b> over nonessential brain tissue and utilize the instrument to direct the probe to the target point from the fixed entry point at the <b>burr</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{procedure}} for {{deep brain stimulation}} placement is similar, though instead of skull being removed, a <b>burr</b> <b>hole</b> is drilled for the electrodes instead and the MAC surgery is more common.|$|E
30|$|Although CSDH is {{a common}} neurosurgical condition, still, there is no {{consensus}} on the best surgical steps among different neurosurgical centers and among neurosurgeons of the same center such as the number of <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> or their size [22, 23], the use of irrigation [24], the site of the drain whether subdural or subgaleal, and the opening of the hematomas’ inner membrane.|$|R
40|$|Subdural effusions are {{uncommon}} but known {{complications of}} arachnoid cysts {{of the middle}} cranial fossa. They mainly occur after minor head traumas in young patients. Here, we report eight cases of arachnoid cyst of the middle cranial fossa associated with subdural hematoma in five cases and hygroma in three cases. Major symptoms are signs of raised intracranial pressure. CT scan and MRI showed the cyst and the subdural effusion. An excellent therapeutic result was achieved with evacuation of the subdural fluid via <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> in the five cases of subdural hematoma while in the two cases of hygroma a subduro-peritoneal shunt was necessary. In the last case, a temporal craniotomy was performed with evacuation of the hygroma and fenestration of the cyst. We suggest treating only the complicating event {{in the case of}} a subdural hematoma via <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> evacuation. Whereas, in the case of hygroma we think that craniotomy with fenestration of the cyst or the use of a subdural shunt are more often neede...|$|R
50|$|Compound {{depressed}} skull fractures {{occur when}} there is a laceration over the fracture, putting the internal cranial cavity in contact with the outside environment, increasing the risk of contamination and infection. In complex depressed fractures, the dura mater is torn. Depressed skull fractures may require surgery to lift the bones off the brain if they are pressing on it by making <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> on the adjacent normal skull.|$|R
50|$|Craniotomy is {{distinguished}} from craniectomy (in which the skull flap is not immediately replaced, allowing {{the brain to}} swell, thus reducing intracranial pressure) and from trepanation, {{the creation of a}} <b>burr</b> <b>hole</b> through the cranium in to the dura mater.|$|E
50|$|In neurosurgery, Dandy's {{point is}} a common entry point for {{occipital}} <b>burr</b> <b>hole.</b> It is located 2 cm lateral to the midline and 3 cm above the inion. In infants this usually corresponds with the lambdoid suture in the mid pupillary line.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} types of {{intracranial}} hematomas, the blood may be removed surgically to remove the mass and reduce the pressure it puts on the brain. The hematoma is evacuated through a <b>burr</b> <b>hole</b> or craniotomy. If transfer to a facility with neurosurgery is prolonged trephination may be performed in the emergency department.|$|E
50|$|The {{natural history}} of this {{disorder}} is not well known. The long term outlook for patients with treated moyamoya seems to be good. While symptoms may seem to improve almost immediately after the in-direct EDAS, EMS, and multiple <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> surgeries, it will take probably 6-12 months before new vessels can develop to give a sufficient blood supply. With the direct STA-MCA surgery, increased blood supply is immediate.|$|R
40|$|Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD) is {{a wave of}} {{complete}} neuronal depolarization that usually lasts for one to two minutes and can silence brain activity {{for a certain time}} after its occurrence. In this research project, changes in LFP during CSD are measured using an A 4 x 8 silicone based planar probe. To perform this experiment, two <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> and two craniotomies are made in the skull of the rat. A screw is placed in each of the <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> to serve as a reference and a ground electrode and the planar probe is inserted in the anterior craniotomy, 2 mm above the bregma, in the right hemisphere of the rat’s skull to record changes in electric potential. To induce CSD propagation, 20 - 40 ?L of various concentrations of potassium acetate (0. 5 M, 1 M, 1. 5 M, 2 M) are dropped on the posterior craniotomy. Results show that increases in [CH 3 CO 2 K] concentration cause not only increases in the frequency of CSD, but also nontrivial changes in their propagation speed, which decreases as the CSD events are repeated. These results provide a greater insight into the nature of the propagation of CSD and will assist in creating computational models and techniques to further understand this phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic {{subdural}} hematomas (CSDHs) {{are common}} in neurosurgical practice. There are no publications that report large series of the epidemiological characteristics of this pathology in Brazil. The purpose is to describe a large series of surgical cases and analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients with CSDH admitted into Neurosurgical Services at the Hospital de Base do Distrito Federal, Brasília, Brazil from 2006 to 2011. Age, sex, clinical feature, etiology, surgical procedure, side, clinical outcome, and recurrence were reviewed. Statistical tests were used to analyze data, and P < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The series included 778 patients. There were 643 (82. 6 %) male patients {{with a mean age}} of 64. 3 ± 15. 9 (range, 14 – 93) years. The principal symptom was headache (58. 9 %). The most frequent origin was a fall (282 cases, 36. 2 %), but the origin remained unclear in 281 (36. 1 %) patients. Mild head injury occurred in 540 (69. 4 %) cases. <b>Burr</b> <b>holes</b> with drainage were used as the surgical procedure in 96. 5 % patients, and 687 (88. 3 %) patients had a positive outcome. Mortality was 0 %. Recurrence was observed in 42 cases. Conclusions: The occurrence of CSDHs is more common in elderly men. Treatment with <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> and drainage is a simple and safe method for treatment. In our experience, CSDH presents decreased morbidity and mortality...|$|R
50|$|Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is a {{surgical}} procedure {{for treatment of}} hydrocephalus in which an opening is created in {{the floor of the}} third ventricle using an endoscope placed within the ventricular system through a <b>burr</b> <b>hole.</b> This allows the cerebrospinal fluid to flow directly to the basal cisterns, bypassing the obstruction. Specifically, the opening is created in the translucent tuber cinereum on the third ventricular floor.|$|E
50|$|Dating back to Neolithic times, a skull {{operation}} called trepanning {{was sometimes}} performed. This involved drilling a <b>burr</b> <b>hole</b> in the cranium. Examination of skulls {{from this period}} reveals that the patients sometimes survived for many years afterward. It seems likely that trepanning was also performed purely for ritualistic or religious reasons. Nowadays this procedure is still used but is normally called a craniectomy.|$|E
50|$|In the US, psychosurgery {{was taken}} up and zealously {{promoted}} by neurologist Walter Freeman and neurosurgeon James Watts. They started a psychosurgery program at George Washington University in 1936, first using Moniz's method but then devised a method of their own in which the connections between the prefrontal lobes and deeper structures in the brain were severed by making a sweeping cut through a <b>burr</b> <b>hole</b> {{on either side of}} the skull. They called their new operation a lobotomy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} lobotomy/leucotomy involved drilling <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> in {{the skull}} {{on the side}} of the head and inserting a cutting instrument; it was thus a [...] "closed" [...] operation, with the surgeon unable to see exactly what he was cutting. In 1937 J.G. Lyerly at the Florida State Hospital developed a similar operation but reached the brain via larger holes in the forehead and was thus able to see what he was cutting. Some neurosurgeons preferred this [...] "open" [...] technique to Freeman and Watts' closed technique as it was less likely to damage blood vessels; it became the most widely used standard lobotomy/leucotomy in the United States.|$|R
50|$|A {{craniotome}} is a {{tool for}} drilling simple <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> (trepanation) or for creating larger openings in the skull (craniotomy). The trepanation tool is generally equipped with a clutch which automatically disengages once it touches softer tissue, thus preventing tears in the dura. For larger openings the craniotome is a surgical instrument that has replaced manually pulled saw wires in craniotomies from the 1980s on. Its working tool tip consists of a spiral blade that is framed by a guard device with an angled cranium guide that rests against the inner layer of the skull bone. The dura guard pushes the dura mater downward while the craniotome is moved forward thus preventing dural tearing.|$|R
40|$|Subdural Empyema {{in infants}} and {{children}} might be life threatening if not managed properly.

The prevalence, etiology, clinical features, investigations and management of SDE are reviewed in this article. Conservative management with antibiotics and follow up imaging is recommended if there are no focal deficits, change in mental status or if the patient is responding well to antibiotics. Alternatively, craniotomy is warranted in addition to antibiotics therapy. The surgeon might opt for <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> in case the patient is frail or in septic shock. </p...|$|R
50|$|Keen's {{point is}} one of the ventriculostomy sites used in neurosurgery, {{typically}} in pediatrics for ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. Keen's point is located 3cm superior and 3 cm posterior to the helix of the ear. A <b>burr</b> <b>hole</b> or small twist drill hole is made in the skull at the Keen's point, to introduce a catheter into the lateral ventricle of brain for the purpose of obtaining or diverting cerebrospinal fluid. The procedure is done for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.|$|E

50|$|This {{treatment}} {{does not}} place a foreign {{body into the}} patient {{so there is a}} much lower risk of infection as compared to a shunt procedure. Along with not implanting a device, this procedure avoids mechanical issues like disconnection, over or underdrainage, and valve dysfunction. The surgery begins by entering the right or left lateral ventricle endoscopically through a <b>burr</b> <b>hole.</b> The third ventricle is identified and entered as well, and an incision is made in the floor of the ventricle and enlarged as necessary with tools such as forceps or Fogarty catheters. If a membrane prevents CSF flow between the ventricle and the subarachnoid space, then an incision is made in the membrane as well. Ideally this procedure can be performed near the midline of the brain with minimal side-to-side motions of the endoscope so as to not tear tissues and cause further complications.|$|E
40|$|Total 200 {{patients}} with subdural haemorrhages were managed in 11 years in Department of Neurosurgery, Rajshahi Medical College. Out of these, 80 patients had acute SDH and 120 patients had chronic SDH. All of them presented with headache and variable degree {{of lack of}} alertness. About 120 patients presented with hemi-paresis, 75 patients presented with urinary retention. Male and female patients were 180 and 20 with a ratio 9 : 1. All the patients were after 6 th decades of life in CSDH. Bilateral acute and chronic SDH was seen in 40 (20 %) patients. All of them were evacuated by two <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> and irrigations with normal saline. One patient developed re-accumulation and drained by ventricular cannula. GCS varied from 7 - 13. ASDH was treated by wide craniotomy. Mortality rate was 25 (12. 5 %) ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryChronic {{subdural}} hematoma (SDH) is {{a common}} clinical entity in neurosurgery. Craniostomy, including twist-drill <b>holes</b> or <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> with or without drainage, is the treatment of choice for SDH. Despite convincing results from this surgical procedure, unexpected complications may still develop such as acute epidural hematoma, acute SDH, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), tension pneumocephalus, and empyema. We present a rare complication of an acute SDH located between the dura and the outer membrane instead of within the previous hematoma cavity (i. e., between the outer and the inner membrane), which occurred after chronic SDH burr-hole evacuation with closed-system drainage. This complication resulted from misplacement of the drainage catheter and superimposed coagulopathy. In conclusion, precisely inserting the drainage catheter in the chronic SDH space and reversing coagulopathy {{before and after the}} surgical procedure are necessary to prevent such complications...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{occurrence}} of cerebrospinal fluid fistulas of the frontal sinus after anterior skull base surgery is not rare. The extracerebral techniques to repair cerebrospinal fluid fistulas are often used, especially because they avoid open-air surgical operations.

Ten millimeters of human fibrin glue was injected into the frontal sinus {{through one of the}} <b>burr</b> <b>holes</b> of the bone flap by an 18 -gauge spinal needle. RESULTS: After an average follow-up period of 2. 8 years, all three patients are in excellent general and neurological conditions and have not shown any further signs of rhinoliquorrhea.
