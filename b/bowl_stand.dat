5000|$|The Holiday Bowl, {{built in}} 1958 in the Crenshaw neighborhood, {{became one of}} Fong's most celebrated projects. [...] She led {{the design of the}} {{cocktail}} lounge, putting in touches like a 3-D map of Japan, to pay tribute to the Japanese American community, just rebuilding after World War II internment. [...] The Holiday <b>Bowl</b> <b>stood</b> as a landmark and community center in Crenshaw for over four decades, bringing together Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Chinese Americans, among others.|$|R

60|$|On the {{afternoon}} following the expedition to Bickleypool, Louis was seated, with an earthenware pan before him, coaxing an actinia with raw beef to expand her blossom, to be copied for Miss Faithfull. Another <b>bowl</b> <b>stood</b> near, containing some feathery serpulas; and the weeds were heaped on the locker {{of the window}} behind him, and {{on the back of}} the chair which supported his lame foot. The third and only remaining chair accommodated James, with a book placed on the table; and a semicircle swept round it, within which nothing marine might extend.|$|R

2500|$|Nebraska {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 33–0 win over the Arizona Wildcats in the 2009 Holiday Bowl where Pelini proclaimed to the Nebraska fans in the Holiday <b>Bowl</b> <b>stands</b> [...] "Nebraska is back and we're here to stay!". [...] The victory was the first bowl shutout of Nebraska's 45 bowl history, as well as the first shutout in Holiday Bowl history. [...] Nebraska's final rank in the coaches and AP media poll was 14th, the highest final ranking since 2001. [...] Under Pelini Nebraska finished #1 in NCAA scoring and pass efficiency defense, the first time since 1984 and 2003 that Nebraska has led the country in those categories respectively.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned to}} the {{policeman}} who stood at the door, a picturesque figure in his white jacket and lava-lava, the loin cloth of the Samoan, {{and told him to}} bring kava. The kava <b>bowl</b> <b>stood</b> {{on the floor in the}} corner of the room, and the policeman filled a half coconut shell and brought it to Walker. He poured a few drops on the ground, murmured the customary words to the company, and drank with relish. Then he told the policeman to serve the waiting natives, and the shell was handed to each one in order of birth or importance and emptied with the same ceremonies.|$|R

25|$|Several other {{buildings}} {{within the park}} are listed at grade II. The oldest of these is an icehouse with a circular brick-lined underground chamber which probably dates from the late 18th century. Several structures that are now listed date from the 1861–2 works to the grounds. The Jacobean-style gate lodge on Chester Road is in red brick with stone dressings and blue brick decoration. The clock tower over the carriage house features stone frames to the clock dials and is topped by a wooden finial with a weather vane. A large iron statue of a mastiff with puppies oversetting a food <b>bowl</b> <b>stands</b> in the forecourt of the hall; it is attributed to Pierre Louis Rouillard and came from the Paris Exhibition of 1855.|$|R

5000|$|... ====Georgia State Stadium==== Georgia State began hosting {{its home}} games at Georgia State Stadium during the 2017 season. Originally {{built for the}} 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games as Centennial Olympic Stadium, the stadium was {{converted}} from Turner Field, a baseball stadium for the Atlanta Braves to a college football stadium. The conversion took place between March and August of 2017, and saw the removal of several sections of the lower <b>bowl</b> <b>stands</b> from right field and a new east side grand-stand built to enclose the new football field. On August 8th, {{it was announced that}} the field would be named Parker H. Petit Field after a major donor with the donation of $10 million. Several more stages of construction will follow after the 2017 season, including removing more lower bowl seating from the remaining right field, and additional facilities added to the upper bowl, including bathroom renovations and concessions.|$|R

60|$|The girl sprang {{away from}} him, {{running to the}} {{opposite}} side of the library table at which she had been reading. Maenck started to pursue her, when she seized a heavy, copper <b>bowl</b> that <b>stood</b> upon the table and hurled it full in his face. The missile struck him a glancing blow, but the edge laid open the flesh of one cheek almost to the jaw bone.|$|R
2500|$|A grade-II*-listed gateway now {{situated}} in the wall {{to the west of}} the hall formerly belonged to Sir Roger Wilbraham's almshouses in Nantwich. The wrought-iron gate features a sun motif with scrolls; it stands in a moulded stone opening flanked by niches containing busts and surmounted by lions. Several other buildings within the park are also listed at grade II. The oldest of these is an icehouse with a circular underground chamber lined with red brick which probably dates from the late 18th century. [...] The reconstruction of the grounds in 1861–2 also resulted in several structures that are now listed. The Jacobean-style gate lodge on Chester Road is in red brick with stone dressings and blue brick decoration. The clock tower over the carriage house features stone frames to the clock dials and is topped by a wooden finial with a weather vane. A large iron statue of a mastiff with puppies oversetting a food <b>bowl</b> <b>stands</b> in the forecourt of the hall; it is attributed to Pierre Louis Rouillard and came from the Paris Exhibition of 1855.|$|R
2500|$|In <b>bowling,</b> {{one player}} <b>stood</b> out. Cowie took 19 of the 40 Test wickets, {{and no other}} player on either side got into double figures [...] partly, perhaps, because England varied their bowling attack for each Test.|$|R
50|$|After sixteen seasons, John Elway retired {{following}} the Super Bowl. He finished his Broncos career with 51,475 yards passing and 300 touchdowns. Until Peyton Manning won Super <b>Bowl</b> 50, Elway <b>stood</b> {{as the only}} Broncos quarterback to win a Super Bowl.|$|R
60|$|Even Captain Lawton {{had been}} {{received}} with many and courteous inquiries {{after the state}} of his health, from {{all the members of}} the family, when he made his morning entrance; but an invisible spirit presided over the comforts of the English colonel. Sarah had shrunk with consciousness from entering the room; yet she knew the position of every glass, and had, with her own hands, supplied the contents of every <b>bowl,</b> that <b>stood</b> on his table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where shall I put--" [...] Ralph began vaguely, {{holding out}} his hat and glancing about him; he {{balanced}} it carefully against a silver <b>bowl</b> that <b>stood</b> upon the sideboard. He then sat himself down rather heavily {{at the head of}} the oval dinner-table. Rodney stood on one side of him and Katharine on the other. He appeared to be presiding over some meeting from which most of the members were absent. Meanwhile, he waited, and his eyes rested upon the glow of the beautifully polished mahogany table.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ceiling of}} the church is plastered, and the east and south walls of the chancel have {{refitted}} 17th-century panels. [...] Elsewhere, on the north, east and south walls, are 13th-century paintings, mainly in red and white, of geometric patterns and floral decorations. On parts of the north and south walls these have been superimposed by 16th and 17th-century black-lettered inscriptions, including the Ten Commandments. [...] Between the nave and the chancel is a wooden screen with a wide central entry and three bays on each side. The lower parts of the bays are panelled, and the upper parts consist of open arches with pendents. The choir stalls date from the 19th-century, and have carved angels as finials. The stone font dates from the 12th century and has a tapering cylindrical bowl carved with a cross and interlacing decoration. The <b>bowl</b> <b>stands</b> on a cylindrical stem and a circular base. Near the font is a 14th-century coffin lid carved with a cross in a circle. The lectern probably dates from the 19th century. The reconstructed Roman altar stands in the blocked north doorway. [...] It carries a badly worn inscription that can be roughly translated as [...] "To the god of the three ways (crossroads), Beccicus dedicates this altar".|$|R
50|$|Container {{glass is}} a type of glass for the {{production}} of glass containers, such as bottles, jars, drinkware, and <b>bowls.</b> Container glass <b>stands</b> in contrast to flat glass (used for windows, glass doors, transparent walls, windshields) and glass fiber (used for thermal insulation, in fiberglass composites, and optical communication).|$|R
50|$|Six modern Rose <b>Bowl</b> records still <b>stand</b> {{as of the}} 2008 Rose Bowl. Buddy Young and Julius Rykovich {{were named}} co-Most {{valuable}} players when the Rose Bowl introduced the award in 1953 and then retroactively applied the award to previous games.

At the 2011 World Cup Qualifier, where Brouwers {{featured}} in three out of her team's five matches, the Netherlands placed seventh, losing its ODI and T20I status. The team has continued to participate in minor international tournaments, with Brouwers' last international match to date coming against Thailand at the 2013 World Twenty20 Qualifier. Because she only took a single wicket in eight T20I fixtures, her T20I career <b>bowling</b> average <b>stands</b> at 137.00, which has been exceeded only by her teammate Annemarie Tanke.|$|R
5000|$|Fields {{was born}} in Washington D.C. where he {{attended}} Woodrow Wilson High School. Recruited to play collegiate football for Michigan State in 1976 where he played both offensive tackle and defensive tackle. During his time with the Spartans, Fields played alongside both Dan Bass and Larry Bethea. In 1977 MSU went 7-3-1 and in 1978 Michigan State won the Big Ten championship. However, the Spartans were on NCAA probation and unable to attend the Rose <b>Bowl.</b> Fields <b>stood</b> out due to his strength and agility. He was drafted {{in the second round}} of the 1980 NFL Draft by the Houston Oilers with whom he played three seasons before being released.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Ugu the Shoemaker, slowly {{filling his}} pipe with fresh tobacco from a silver <b>bowl</b> that <b>stood</b> beside him, [...] "that {{is exactly what}} I imagine. It will do you no good to demand from me the girl who was {{formerly}} the Ruler of Oz, because I will not tell you where I have hidden her, and you can't guess in a thousand years. Neither will I restore to you any of the magic I have captured. I am not so foolish. But bear this in mind: I mean to be the Ruler of Oz myself, hereafter, so I advise you to be careful how you address your future Monarch." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{furnishings}} {{were largely}} replaced in 1863 - 64 although {{the base of}} a rood screen dating from around the 15th century has survived. The granite font dates from the 12th century. It has a lead lined round <b>bowl</b> which <b>stands</b> on a shaft carved with cable moulding on a round base. A memorial stone to John Mably who died in 1687 is in the south porch. Inside the church on the south wall is a memorial to Ernest Edward Betjeman, the father of Sir John Betjeman, who died in 1984. There is a memorial to the three crew lost on the brig Maria Asumpta, which was wrecked on The Rumps in 1995.|$|R
