An officer dusted the bedroom window's exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment generated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes {{a moment to}} the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E
5|$|Glastonbury Methodist Church on Lambrook Street {{was built}} in 1843 and has a galleried interior, typical of a non-conformist chapel of that period, but an unusual number of stained glass windows. Close <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{of the church is}} an ancient pond, which was later covered to form a brick-arched reservoir. This is {{mentioned}} in property deeds of 1821, and is still accessible, containing approximately 31,500 gallons of water.|$|E

5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed at the tail-end of a stationary front, organizing into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on October28 about 520mi (835km) south-southeast of Bermuda. Steered west-northwest and then sharply northeast ahead {{of an approaching}} cold front, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Shary six hours after formation. Within an environment of low wind shear, Shary strengthened into a hurricane and attained peak winds of 75mph (120km/h) by 00:00UTC on October30 as an eye became apparent on microwave imagery. The storm became increasingly asymmetric as it interacted with the front, and Shary transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 18:00UTC that day. The extratropical system was completely absorbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> six hours later. Since Shary remained south and east of Bermuda, its effects were limited to 0.54in (13.7mm) of rainfall and a gust to 35mph (56km/h).|$|E
5|$|After exiting Cuba {{into the}} Gulf of Mexico, the {{hurricane}} weakened greatly. On October20 it passed {{a short distance}} west of Key West, Florida, and very early on October21 the hurricane moved over Marco Island with winds of 90mph (150km/h). The cyclone weakened further as it turned eastward through the state, deteriorating to tropical storm status as it passed near or over Miami. It accelerated east-northeastward, moving over the Abaco Islands in The Bahamas. Gradually weakening, the storm interacted with an approaching cold front; late on October23 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and shortly thereafter it was absorbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b>|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{depression}} turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an oncoming cold front, and strengthened into a subtropical storm. The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the Azores, the storm weakened slightly {{as it moved}} to the north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front early on October5 the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> later that day. The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become Subtropical Storm Vince on October8.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down {{into a number of}} major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and tail end of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 to 1978, the Giants {{registered}} {{just two}} winning seasons and {{were unable to}} advance to the playoffs. During this period the team also traded away quarterback Fran Tarkenton, who would later lead the Minnesota Vikings to three Super Bowls and end up in the Hall of Fame. This period was characterized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> office's bad decisions in the college draft, several ill-advised trades, and the team's fans' growing disappointment. It was not until the 1980s that the Giants would develop a consistent playoff team.|$|E

5|$|All Saints' parish {{church was}} rebuilt in 1873 {{and is a}} grade II listed building. James Oglethorpe, {{the founder of the}} state of Georgia, now part of the United States of America, is buried with his wife at the centre of its chancel. The area around the church forms a {{conservation}} area. There is a second church called St Luke's further north on Front Lane. Cranham Hall, the former manor house, is a grade II listed building. There are two community associations that are both registered charities. The Cranham Community Association operates a broad range of sporting, self-improvement and hobby activities at Cranham Community Centre on Marlborough Gardens. Cranham Social Hall, with a capacity of 100, is separately operated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> Lane Community Association, and provides a limited range of activities. The main cultural and entertainment facilities of the borough are located in Hornchurch and Romford.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{limbs of}} the horse are {{structures}} made of dozens of bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support {{the weight of the}} equine body. They include two apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, and the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. The limbs play a major part in the movement {{of the horse}}, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures which provide blood flow through the lower leg. As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary defense mechanism of running over hard ground, its legs evolved to the long, sturdy, light-weight, one-toed form seen today.|$|E

These withdrawals, although costly in losses of personnel and materiel, avoided major encirclements experienced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fronts</b> to <b>the</b> south, and succeeded in delaying the Army Group North sufficiently to allow preparation for the defence of Leningrad.|$|R
5|$|The plumage of {{an adult}} bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is {{moderately}} long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism {{is evident in the}} species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African fish eagle (H. vocifer) (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.|$|E
