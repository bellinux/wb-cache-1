25|$|Barrier Disruption: In {{isolates}} from Blastocystis sp. subtype 4, {{study has}} demonstrated that Blastocystis {{has the ability to}} alter the arrangement of F-actin in intestinal epithelial cells. Actin filaments are important in stabilizing tight junctions; they in turn stabilize the barrier, which is a layer of cells, between the intestinal epithelial cells and the intestinal content.

25|$|Epilepsy is {{a common}} {{neurological}} disease that is characterized by recurrent and sometimes untreatable seizures. Several clinical and experimental data have implicated the failure of blood–brain <b>barrier</b> <b>function</b> in triggering chronic or acute seizures. Some studies implicate the interactions between a common blood protein (albumin) and astrocytes. These findings suggest that acute seizures are a predictable consequence of disruption of the BBB by either artificial or inflammatory mechanisms. In addition, expression of drug resistance molecules and transporters at the BBB are a significant mechanism of resistance to commonly used anti-epileptic drugs.|$|E
25|$|Endotoxemia is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of colic and warrants aggressive treatment. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) is released from the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria when they die. Normally, endotoxin is prevented from entering systemic circulation by the <b>barrier</b> <b>function</b> of the intestinal mucosa, antibodies and enzymes which bind and neutralize it and, for the small amount that manages to enter the blood stream, removal by Kupffer cells in the liver. Endotoxemia occurs {{when there is an}} overgrowth and secondary die-off of gram negative bacteria, releasing mass quantities of endotoxin. This is especially common when the mucosal barrier is damaged, as with ischemia of the GI tract secondary to a strangulating lesion or displacement. Endotoxemia produces systemic effects such as cardiovascular shock, insulin resistance, and coagulation abnormalities.|$|E

2500|$|Research by Nina Jablonski {{suggests}} that an estimated time of about 10,000 to 20,000 years {{is enough for}} human populations to achieve optimal skin pigmentation in a particular geographic area but that development of ideal skin coloration may happen faster if the evolutionary pressure is stronger, even {{in as little as}} 100 generations. The length of time is also affected by cultural practices such as food intake, clothing, body coverings, and shelter usage which can alter {{the ways in which the}} environment affects populations. [...] One of the most recently proposed drivers of the evolution of skin pigmentation in humans is based on research that shows a superior <b>barrier</b> <b>function</b> in darkly pigmented skin. Most protective functions of the skin, including the permeability barrier and the antimicrobial barrier, reside in the stratum corneum (SC) and the researchers surmise that the SC has undergone the most genetic change since the loss of human body hair. Natural selection would have favored mutations that protect this essential barrier; one such protective adaptation is the pigmentation of interfollicular epidermis, because it improves <b>barrier</b> <b>function</b> as compared to non-pigmented skin. In lush rainforests, however, where UV-B radiation and xeric stress were not in excess, light pigmentation would not have been nearly as detrimental. This explains the side-by-side residence of lightly pigmented and darkly pigmented peoples.|$|E
2500|$|The skin of {{the bony}} ear canal is unique, {{in that it is}} not movable but is closely {{attached}} to the bone, and it is almost paper thin. For these reasons, it is easily abraded or torn by even minimal physical force. Inflammation of the ear canal skin typically begins with a physical insult, most often from injury caused by attempts at self-cleaning or scratching with cotton swabs, pen caps, fingernails, hair pins, keys, or other small implements. Another causative factor for acute infection is prolonged water exposure in the forms of swimming or exposure to extreme humidity, which can compromise the protective <b>barrier</b> <b>function</b> of the canal skin, allowing bacteria to flourish, hence the name [...] "swimmer's ear".|$|E

40|$|Since the ?trends in risk level? project {{first was}} started, the weights used to {{estimate}} the risk level on the Norwegian Continental Shelf has more or less been the same; five sets of generic weights, one {{for each type of}} facility, and not facility specific and time dependent. The aim of this master thesis has been to develop a new weight estimation model. The new model estimates time dependent and facility specific weights, based on risk analyses and observed <b>barrier</b> <b>functions?</b> performances. These weights are combined with occurrences of major accident precursors for each facility and then summed up for the entire Norwegian Continental Shelf. This estimates one risk indicator, combining both types of major accident related data reported in the ?trends in risk level? project. The developed model consists of two methods; method 1 and method 2. Both methods use the facility?s QRA and reported <b>barrier</b> <b>functions?</b> performances when estimating new weights. There are however some differences between the two methods. o	Method 1 reproduces parts of the risk analysis, but instead of using assumed <b>barrier</b> <b>functions?</b> performances, observed performance is used. Based on the updated risk analysis, weights are estimated. o	Method 2 adjusts the risk estimated by the original risk analysis by correction factors based on deviations between the observed <b>barrier</b> <b>functions?</b> performances and benchmark values. Both methods estimate facility specific weights based on <b>barrier</b> <b>functions?</b> performances. Method 1 gives more correct weights, is more time-consuming and requires more information from the available data. Method 2 will be less specific to the facility, as it uses general calibration factors established based on other facilities. The test cases show that method 1 will give good weight estimates and that weights can be estimated by method 2. It can also be seen that the new weight estimates are significantly different from the generic weights and that the estimated weights changes from year to year depending on <b>barrier</b> <b>functions?</b> performances. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a conic optimization formulation for inequality-constrained convex programming, and propose a self-dual embedding model for solving the resulting conic optimization problem. The primal and dual cones in this formulation {{are characterized by}} the original constraint functions and their corresponding conjugate functions respectively. Hence they are completely symmetric. This allows for a standard primal-dual path following approach for solving the embedded problem. Moreover, there are two immediate logarithmic <b>barrier</b> <b>functions</b> for the primal and dual cones. We show that these two logarithmic <b>barrier</b> <b>functions</b> are conjugate to each other. The explicit form of the conjugate functions are in fact not required to be known in the algorithm.

40|$|High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) is the {{extension}} to the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). HSDPA allows for higher data rates due to new adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) techniques, Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (H-ARQ) and fast scheduling algorithm. One {{of the key}} features of HSDPA technology is to handle UMTS traffic classes with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In order to provide QoS several scheduling algorithms, QoS control constraints, and different other schemes have been proposed in literature. In the thesis, a simple matlab based model for HSDPA is presented in order to simulate various algorithms. The QoS controls in terms of guaranteed bit rate (GBR) have been implemented by means of <b>barrier</b> <b>functions</b> which perform <b>barrier</b> around the feasible region. The results illustrate the trade-off between the cell throughput and the minimum guaranteed bit rate. Traffic classes are prioritized by means of QoS parameters. The priority is given to RT traffic streams over interactive services. Real-Time (RT) algorithms have been simulated to prioritize traffic classes based on delays. QoS {{is the ability to}} provide resources and prioritize different applications. As mentioned before, the 3 GPP standard defines four categories of service (Conversation, streaming, interactive and background) for UMTS. Strategies in traffic management, priority GBR allowances and bandwidth are important strategies for traffic differentiation and quality of service (QoS). Providing QoS over HSDPA is one of the challenging tasks for researchers. The significant results and findings of our thesis are as follows • In this thesis various algorithms were implemented with their duties barrier to provide guarantees of quality, in terms of speed guaranteed (GBR). The emphasis was to ensure the flow and priority categories of traffic. First the performance of algorithms were studied alone and then along with the <b>barrier</b> <b>functions.</b> It is concluded that <b>barrier</b> <b>functions</b> play an important role by means of providing QoS guarantee in HSDPA, considering channel conditions. Traffic classes were prioritized on QoS parameters defined for <b>barrier</b> <b>functions.</b> It was found that minimum bit rates were maintained by <b>barrier</b> <b>functions</b> but the cell throughput decreases with their <b>barrier</b> <b>functions</b> depending upon QoS parameters. The streaming aware scheduler has been evaluated by means of simulations in mixed scenarios and it is concluded that this algorithm protects streaming QoS in high overload conditions. It is therefore concluded that <b>barrier</b> <b>functions</b> and streaming aware schedulers are the best option for QoS control.
