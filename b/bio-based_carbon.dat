40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work is to compare three techniques for characterizing the morphology of porous <b>bio-based</b> <b>carbon</b> foam, namely mercury intrusion porosimetry, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microtomography. The first two techniques are commonly used in this field, while X-ray microtomography is a more recent characterization technique derived from medical tomography. Our study demonstrates the added value of the latter technique, especially concerning the evaluation of porosity, cell size distributions and cell connectivity. In this study we {{have shown that the}} material have a total porosity of around 90 % with a cell size of less than 100 microns. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{potentially}} bio-based methacrylate derivatives, namely (with mol. % of <b>bio-based</b> <b>carbon),</b> butanediol dimethacrylate (BDDMA) (33 %), isobornyl methacrylate (IBOMA) (71 %), lauryl methacrylate (LMA) (75 %) {{have been}} evaluated as alternatives to styrene as reactive diluent of unsaturated polyester (UPR). First the compatibility of these compounds with SMC/BMC processes has been studied in terms of volatility, miscibility with UPR and viscosity. Based on these preliminary experiments, butanediol dimethacrylate (BDDMA) was selected as sole reactive diluent. The thermo-mechanical and mechanical properties of the resulting network {{were found to be}} very different from the ones of a UPR/MMA network prepared as a reference. Consequently, mixtures constituted of BDDMA and one monomethacrylate derivative (MMA, IBOMA and LMA) were then used as reactive diluents to yield networks owning a large range of mechanical behaviours...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{materials}} was prepared by curing acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) and dibutyl itaconate (DBI) or ethyl cinnamate (EC) comonomers to provide examples of thermosets {{with a high}} proportion of <b>bio-based</b> <b>carbon,</b> in accordance with the principles of green chemistry. The comonomers, representative of cellulose-derived (DBI) or potentially lignin-derived (EC) raw materials, were tested at levels of 25 %, 33 %, and 50 % by mass and the resulting products were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and dynamic mechanical analysis. Both DBI and EC were incorporated into the thermosets to a high extent (> 90 %) at all concentrations tested. The AESO-DBI and AESO-EC blends showed substantial degradation at 390 – 400 °C, similar to pure AESO. Glass transition temperatures decreased as comonomer content increased; the highest Tg of 41. 4 °C was observed for AESO-EC (3 : 1) and the lowest Tg of 1. 4 °C was observed for AESO-DBI (1 : 1). Accordingly, at 30 °C the storage modulus values were highest for AESO-EC (3 : 1, 37. 0 MPa) and lowest for AESO-DBI (1 : 1, 1. 5 MPa) ...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{microporous}} <b>bio-based</b> activated <b>carbon</b> fibers (ACFs) {{were prepared}} through a simple reactivation method. Sawdust, {{as the starting}} material, was liquefied and melt-spun to produce the precursor fibers. Then, the precursor fibers were activated by KOH and reactivated by steam. By varying {{the conditions of the}} two activation processes, the formation mechanism of the pore structure was studied, and the result showed that steam reactivation has a positive effect on the development of microporosity. The sample with the optimal condition exhibited the highest specific surface area of 2578 m 2 ·g− 1 as well as the largest pore volume of 1. 425 cm 3 ·g− 1, where micropores contributed 70. 3 %. Due to its excellent texture properties, the ACF exhibited a high adsorption capacity of 1934 mg/g for iodine...|$|R
40|$|Valorization {{strategies}} of wastes from agri-food processes are intertwined with clean technological approaches and eco-industrial management. By-products from Mediterranean agri-food {{processes such as}} olive oil, wine and fruit create a considerable disposal problem for the agro-industry. Their characteristics in combination with Mediterranean climate enhance microbial development and can be source of health and safety concerns. After pre-treatment and recovery of valuable precursor materials (lignin, pulp), pyrolysis {{can be used for}} fuels, chemicals and <b>carbon</b> <b>bio-based</b> materials production. Since thermal degradation kinetic studies are a key step for the efficient design of thermo-chemical processes, in this study pyrolysis experiments were performed, using TGA for the estimation of the process kinetic parameters.

40|$|How do {{you build}} a {{sustainable}} house in New Zealand? - is it even possible?" This thesis is structured in three parts to answer this question. The first part asks, then answers, "What is sustainability?", "How do you measure sustainability?" and "How {{do you know when}} you have reached sustainability - what is its limit?" The second part describes the methodologies for conducting embodied energy and CO 2 analysis. The third part applies the results of the sustainability definition, and the energy and CO 2 methodologies to a series of house designs. Part 1 defines, measures, and establishes a limit for sustainability. It reviews the history of sustainability and sustainable development. A distillation of what is being sought by the various parties to the sustainability debate then contributes to a checklist of essential requirements for a functional definition of sustainability. Addressing climate change is shown to be the major requirement. The checklist enables answers to the questions about measuring sustainability, and knowing when its limit has been reached, and leads to a functional definition: Sustainability meets the needs of the present without annual CO 2 emissions exceeding what the planet can absorb. The requirements for sustainability indicator methods are examined. A robust way of comparing environment impacts is introduced. Several common sustainability indicators are examined against the requirements, but are found wanting, while two are found to be effective: energy and CO 2 analysis. Human population and annual global carbon absorption are used to identify global and per-capita sustainability limits, which can be applied at many scales to many activities. They are applied to New Zealand's housing sector to identify a sustainable annual per-house emissions target, including construction, maintenance, and operation. Part 2 reviews the methodologies to measure and delimit sustainability using embodied energy and embodied CO 2 analysis. A new, fast, accurate, and reliable process-based hybrid analysis method developed for this research is used to derive embodied energy and CO 2 coefficients for building materials. Part 3 applies the results of the sustainability definition and limit, and the energy and CO 2 methodologies and coefficients from analysing building materials, to a series of house designs within New Zealand and global contexts. A spreadsheet-based calculator developed for this analysis that has potential beyond this thesis is described. A method is presented for annualising emissions to fairly account for differing building components' lifetimes. Finally, a sustainable house is shown to be possible by combining several strategies to meet the challenging sustainable emissions target. Technologies that reduce grid electricity use - solar hot water, PV, and wind-generators - are crucial, cutting emissions the most. <b>Bio-based</b> materials sequestering <b>carbon</b> are the second most important strategy: strawbale insulation to ~R 10, and timber for framing, cladding, windows, linings, and roofing. Efficient appliances, lighting, and other low-emission materials were also helpful. Other key outcomes were: hot water heating emits the most CO 2, double any other category; heating energy emissions are smaller than any other category; CO 2 -optimal conventional insulation levels are ~R 5; CO 2 flux of materials is double operating energy CO 2 for sustainable houses...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{markets for}} {{applications}} of biocomposites are expanding internationally. A biocomposite is a material {{made from a}} mixture of natural fibers and a thermoplastic polymer to obtain a product having some characteristics of both resources: (a) filler reinforcement (plus wood-like appearance of wood plastics) and (b) plastic performance in wet conditions. Wood–polymer composites (WPCs) are used mainly in four different sectors of materials applications: building, construction, automotive, and marine infrastructures. Current major scientific and technological efforts are focused on increasing the <b>bio-based</b> <b>carbon</b> content and minimizing environmental impacts {{associated with the use}} of polymeric materials. However, bio-based composites can create problems at the end of their lives. The current recycling streams are not suited to such materials. That is why the focus is increasingly on “eco-friendly” materials such as composites based on natural or synthetic biodegradable polymers and fillers such as starch, vegetable fiber, or wood flour. The most studied WPC-based biodegradable matrix systems are composites based on polylactic acid (PLA). Many studies deal with the mechanical properties and the inclusions of additives to improve the effects of reinforcing fillers. However, very few studies are devoted to the durability of these new biocomposites during their service life...|$|E
40|$|Carbon fiber based polymer {{composites}} {{have been}} recognized as advanced materials for structural applications. The unique reinforcing abilities of carbon fibers with their combination of high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent fatigue resistance have made carbon fiber based composites exceptional compared to other fiber reinforced composites. However, the high cost involved in current precursor materials for carbon fibers has limited the widespread applicability of carbon fibers. Hence, intensification of research efforts towards cheaper and easily available raw material for fabrication of carbon fibers is justified. The growing demand for low cost carbon fibers for mainstream composite applications has driven recent interests in using lignin as alternative choice of material for carbon fiber precursor. Lignin is a highly aromatic, plant-derived amorphous polymer and has been considered as potential low-cost, <b>bio-based</b> <b>carbon</b> fiber precursor. Copolymers of polyacrylonitrile/lignin were developed as alternative precursors for fabrication of raw fibers using conventional solution spinning techniques. Lignin/polyacrylonitrile copolymers were successfully synthesized and characterized using FT-IR and NMR techniques. The thermal properties of the copolymers were studied by DSC and TGA analysis. The effect of chemical modification on the morphology and stability of the carbon fibers from PAN-Lignin copolymers has been studied using Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Modification of lignin prior to copolymerization provided a significant advantage in the improvement of precursor processability using solution spinning. Additionally, carbon fibers obtained from copolymers containing different varieties of lignins were examined. Carbon fibers produced from organosolv lignin/polyacrylonitrile copolymers exhibit promising carbon fiber structure when compared to softwood/lignin polyacrylonitrile copolymers...|$|E
