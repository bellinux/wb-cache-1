40|$|Bees {{are known}} to collect pollen and nectar to provide their larvae and {{themselves}} with food. That bees, especially the tropical stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini), also collect plant resins has, however, been barely addressed in scientific studies on resource use in <b>bees.</b> <b>Resins</b> are used for nest construction, nest maintenance and nest defence. Furthermore, some South-East Asian species transfer resin-derived terpenes to their cuticular profiles. The <b>resin</b> requirement of <b>bees</b> is in turn used by certain plant species, which attract bees either for pollination by providing resin in their inflorescences, or for seed dispersal by providing resin in their seed capsules (mellitochory). Mellitochory {{is found in the}} eucalypt tree Corymbia torelliana, the resin of which is collected by Australian stingless bees. We investigated how the interaction between C. torelliana and resin-collecting bees affects the chemical ecology of two Australian stingless bee genera by comparing the chemical profiles of eight <b>bee</b> species with <b>resin</b> from C. torelliana fruits. The two bee genera differed significantly in their chemical profiles. Similar to South-East Asian stingless bees, 51 % of all compounds on the body surfaces of the five Tetragonula species were most likely derived from plant resins. Up to 32 compounds were identical with compounds from C. torelliana resin, suggesting that Tetragonula species include C. torelliana compounds in their chemical profiles. By contrast, few or none resinous compounds were found on the body surfaces of the three Austroplebeia species sampled. However, one prominent but as yet unknown substance was found in both C. torelliana resin and the chemical profiles of all Tetragonula and four Austroplebeia colonies sampled, suggesting that most colonies (76 %) gathered resin from C. torelliana. Hence, C. torelliana resin may be commonly collected by Australian stingless bees and, along with resins from other plant species, shape their chemical ecology...|$|R

40|$|Background/Question/Methods: The highly social stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) are {{important}} pollinators in tropical ecosystems. Besides pollen and nectar they also collect {{large amounts of}} plant resins which they use for nest construction and defense. They further transfer resin-derived terpenes to their body surfaces, thereby increasing the diversity of their chemical profiles. We observed resin collection by stingless bees at trees and colony entrances in Borneo, to investigate whether <b>bees</b> collected <b>resin</b> from many different or only few specific trees and whether different bee species differed in or shared their preferred resin trees. Results/Conclusions: At our field site, all stingless <b>bee</b> species collected <b>resin</b> from several tree species, particularly from trees of the resinous dipterocarp family. All colonies collected a large variety of resins, suggesting that stingless bees visit several tree species rather than just a few adjacent resin wounds. Analysis of network-level specialization revealed that stingless bees are highly generalist resin collectors with no specific preferences for specific tree species but a variety of resin sources visited. Although stingless bees collect a large variety of resins, they only transfer a subset of terpenes derived from these resins to their body surface. Some species even exclude whole classes of terpenes, thereby increasing chemical differences between species and revealing a hitherto unknown ability of bees to filter terpenes derived from resins and embed them in their chemical profiles...|$|R

Overall, a positive antimicrobial effect could be shown. However, {{when compared to the}} commonly used control substances (e. g., specific antibiotics, antiseptics and antifungals), propolis appeared less effective, depending on the bacterial strain, and required higher concentrations than the control substances, in order to show a measurable effect. Nevertheless, propolis as a natural herbal <b>resin</b> <b>bee</b> product can be considered as a natural antiseptic agent within the range of other herbal products, like sanguinarine.

40|$|The {{constant}} pressure posed by parasites has caused species throughout {{the animal kingdom}} to evolve suites of mechanisms to resist infection. Individual barriers and physiological defenses are considered the main barriers against parasites in invertebrate species. However, behavioral traits and other non-immunological defenses can also effectively reduce parasite transmission and infection intensity. In social insects, behaviors that reduce colony-level parasite loads are termed "social immunity. " One example of a behavioral defense is <b>resin</b> collection. Honey <b>bees</b> forage for plant-produced resins and incorporate them into their nest architecture. This use of resins can reduce chronic elevation of an individual bee's immune response. Since high activation of individual immunity can impose colony-level fitness costs, collection of resins may benefit both the individual and colony fitness. However the use of resins as a more direct defense against pathogens is unclear. Here we present evidence that honey bee colonies may self-medicate with plant resins {{in response to a}} fungal infection. Self-medication is generally defined as an individual responding to infection by ingesting or harvesting non-nutritive compounds or plant materials. Our results show that colonies increase resin foraging rates after a challenge with a fungal parasite (Ascophaera apis: chalkbrood or CB). Additionally, colonies experimentally enriched with resin had decreased infection intensities of this fungal parasite. If considered self-medication, this is a particularly unique example because it operates at the colony level. Most instances of self-medication involve pharmacophagy, whereby individuals change their diet in response to direct infection with a parasite. In this case with honey <b>bees,</b> <b>resins</b> are not ingested but used within the hive by adult bees exposed to fungal spores. Thus the colony, as the unit of selection, may be responding to infection through self-medication by increasing the number of individuals that forage for resin...|$|R

40|$|The {{diversity}} of species is striking, {{but can be}} far exceeded by the chemical {{diversity of}} compounds collected, produced or used by them. Here, we relate the specificity of plant-consumer interactions to chemical diversity applying a comparative network analysis to both levels. Chemical diversity was explored for interactions between tropical stingless <b>bees</b> and plant <b>resins,</b> which <b>bees</b> collect for nest construction and to deter predators and microbes. Resins also function as an environmental source for terpenes that serve as appeasement allomones and protection against predators when accumulated on the bees' body surfaces. To unravel {{the origin of the}} bees' complex chemical profiles, we investigated resin collection and the processing of resin-derived terpenes. We therefore analyzed chemical networks of tree resins, foraging networks of <b>resin</b> collecting <b>bees,</b> and their acquired chemical networks. We revealed that 113 terpenes in nests of six bee species and 83 on their body surfaces comprised a subset of the 1, 117 compounds found in resins from seven tree species. Sesquiterpenes were the most variable class of terpenes. Albeit widely present in tree resins, they were only found on the body surface of some species, but entirely lacking in others. Moreover, whereas the nest profile of Tetragonula melanocephala contained sesquiterpenes, its surface profile did not. Stingless bees showed a generalized collecting behavior among resin sources, and only a hitherto undescribed species-specific "filtering" of resin-derived terpenes can explain the variation in chemical profiles of nests and body surfaces from different species.

Artificially induced wounds were found by bees within 1 – 2 d. The number of foragers at artificial wounds increased during the subsequent 5 d until resin secretion stopped or the resin hardened. At natural resin wounds, species identity and number of foragers remained constant during the observation period. <b>Bees</b> collected <b>resin</b> from some trees and ignored others.

The number of circulating hemocytes in hemolymph remained constant despite the differential diet during the experiment. However, the development of fat bodies and hypopharyngeal glands was altered by propolis ingestion. The abdominal fat body development in winter bees diminished after fourteen days of propolis consumption, while it increased in summer bees. The hypopharyngeal gland development decreased for the assayed period in workers from both seasons. Our results encourage us to continue exploring this research field and learn how long-term forced ingestion of a plant-derived compound, a non-nutritive substance, can modify physiological bee parameters.

Therefore, the resin chemistry of C. torelliana may be particularly well adapted to attract the bees. While the importance of visual and olfactory cues has been frequently studied in pollination mutualisms, we here provide the first study to investigate the importance of resin compounds as olfactory cues in a bee seed dispersal mutualism. To investigate whether the seed-dispersing Australian stingless bee species Tetragonula carbonaria relies on olfactory cues when searching for C. torelliana resin and which compounds of the blend they use to identify it, we performed several choice tests with pure resin extracts, fractionated extracts, extracts enriched with C. torelliana resin compounds and with single compounds. Olfactory cues were sufficient to attract bees, confirming the importance of olfactory cues for resin-searching stingless bees. However, bees only landed on filter papers with pure resin extract, but not on fractionated or enriched extracts, nor on single compounds. This finding indicates that, instead of relying on just a few specific volatile compounds, the bees used a complex blend as recognition cue including relative compound proportions. Moreover, they showed little tolerance for even slight concentration changes of single components.
