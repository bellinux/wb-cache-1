25|$|Without {{waiting to}} be {{told what to do}} by the Senate, Appius Claudius <b>began</b> <b>bold</b> public works to address the supply problem. An {{aqueduct}} (the Aqua Appia) secured the water supply of the city of Rome. By far the best known project was the road, which ran across the Pontine Marshes to the coast northwest of Naples, where it turned north to Capua. On it, any number of fresh troops could be sped to the theatre of operations, and supplies could be moved en masse to Roman bases without hindrance by either enemy or terrain. It is no surprise that, after his term as censor, Appius Claudius became consul twice, subsequently held other offices, and was a respected consultant to the state even during his later years.|$|R

The approach is to “send human and robotic explorers as partners, leveraging the capabilities of each where most useful. ” Human-robot interfacing technologies for this approach are required at readiness levels above any available today.

5000|$|In {{his early}} paintings, Tuke placed his male nudes in mythological contexts, but the critics found these works {{to be rather}} formal, lifeless and flaccid. [...] From the 1890s, Tuke {{abandoned}} mythological themes and began to paint local boys fishing, sailing, swimming and diving, and also began to paint in a more naturalistic style. His handling of paint became freer, and he <b>began</b> using <b>bold,</b> fresh colour. One of his best known paintings from this period is August Blue (1893-1894), a study of four mostly nude youths bathing from a boat. The Looe artist, Lindsay Symington (1872-1942), modelled for the blonde boy holding onto the boat in the water; though not a regular model, Symington {{was a good friend}} of Tuke, the latter often visiting the Symington family home, Pixies' Holt, at Dartmeet. Tuke painted some female nudes but these were not as successful as his male nude paintings.|$|R

In his earlier paintings, Hunter was influenced by Cézanne to produce domestic landscapes. Later, however, in common with {{the other members of the}} Scottish colourists movement, he was heavily influenced by contemporary French artists like Monet and Matisse, and his paintings <b>began</b> to make <b>bolder</b> and more energetic use of colour.|$|R

Upon reaching the sea he is captured by Turkish Muslim slave-traders and sold into Zheng He's Chinese treasure fleet. Bold befriends a young African slave, named Kyu, whom he cares for after the Chinese castrate him.

5000|$|On September 3, Lyautey {{received}} missives from Thami El Glaoui, informing {{him that}} the situation in Marrakesh had turned decisively against the Hibists. Al-Hiba's puritanical edicts - he famously ordered all unmarried women in Marrakesh to take a husband from among his mujahadeen - had already alienated much of the city's resident population. [...] The timidity and defeats of the Hibist armies in the skirmishes with Mangin now fostered doubts about al-Hiba's military judgment and leadership qualities, and began to disenchant his followers. Even the more fanatical ones who regarded him as a mahdi began feeling uneasy. Al-Hiba's mystical promise that [...] "French bullets would turn into water and French shells into watermelons" [...] had been tested and found wanting. [...] As al-Hiba's popularity was weakening, the qaids <b>began</b> feeling <b>bolder.</b> Should the French march on Marrakesh, El Glaoui promised, the qaids were prepared to pounce inside the city and secure the French hostages themselves.|$|R

50|$|Ardabil rugs feature motifs {{that are}} very similar to Caucasian rugs, but with more motifs and objects woven into the borders. The colors are also lighter. The {{patterns}} are predominantly geometric and the most common layouts on Ardabil rugs are medallions, multiple connected diamond-shaped medallions, and all-over octagonal shapes. The most recognized design found on Ardabil rugs is the famous Mahi (Herati) design - a diamond medallion and small fish throughout. Some modern weavers have <b>begun</b> to favor <b>bold</b> geometric patterns over the traditional Mahi (Herati) design, and have added colors such as turquoise and purple to the more traditional red, pink, ivory, green, and blue.|$|R

50|$|More recent interpretations have disputed this gnomic exhortation. According to John Niles, in this “genteel” reading, {{it seems}} less {{consequential}} whether the wife has been scorned by one husband or two; {{it is her}} “dignified passivity” {{as well as her}} gnomic wisdom on which scholars focus. In “vindictive” readings, however, the wife is generally seen to burn with anger toward one man - her husband. In such views, The Wife’s Lament <b>begins</b> as a <b>bold</b> statement of misery, transitions into a description of her misfortunes in which she nostalgically recalls happy days with her husband, and ends in a bitter curse upon this same man who has now abandoned her.|$|R

She {{would continue to}} utilize vibrant color {{for the rest of}} her career. In addition, she began to fracture her paintings in a cubistic fashion and began to make use of looser brushwork. A good example of these new found techniques is a work from 1991 entitled L’adiau. In this piece Delia depicts a memory of travel and combines it with a feeling of separation. Two figures dominate this scene, they seem to be say goodbye to one another but are far removed from each other, effectively highlighting both the sadness of separation and the feeling of ambiguity.|$|R

50|$|In the 1960s, as the {{political}} and social front of America began to explode in all directions, the black artist <b>began</b> to take <b>bold</b> declarative initiatives, making definitive imagery, inspired by the specific conditions of the African American experience. Abstraction remained a critical issue for artists like Sam Gilliam. Gilliam's sense of color is modulated by his study of light, color, and its transformative and changing dynamics. He is most widely known for the large color-stained canvases he draped and suspended from the walls and ceilings during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Gilliam's early style developed from brooding figural abstractions into large paintings of flatly applied color, pushing Gilliam to eventually remove the easel aspect of painting by eliminating the stretcher.|$|R

I would follow her to Kentucky, to Europe, to the uttermost ends of the earth. I could do it now. The frozen deposits in my terminal moraine would furnish me with the means. I walked away and left the old farmer standing grinning.

But, as yet, there was no sound or sign of human life! That was to come.|$|R
