50|$|Jump {{starters}} are {{portable battery}} devices {{that allow for}} jump starting of vehicles. These devices operate similar to jumper cables but do not require an additional vehicle to provide the power needed to boost the dead vehicle <b>battery.</b> <b>Jump</b> starters come in various sizes (typically rated in Amps). Most jump starters {{on the market today}} use lead-acid batteries and claim 400 to 1700 Amps ratings. The main disadvantage of lead-acid jump starters is weight, size and <b>battery</b> chemistry. Lead-acid <b>jump</b> starters can be extremely heavy and large, making them less than convenient when transporting between vehicles. Lead-acid batteries may self-discharge develop a condition called sulfating, which permanently loses battery capacity. It is entirely possible to destroy a new lead-acid battery within months that will require a replacement.|$|R

50|$|Mr. Bean has {{a letter}} he wants to post, but upon {{unlocking}} his car through finding a number of keys hidden within it, he finds that the battery is dead, and so decides to take the bus. A few moments upon reaching the bus stop, a man waiting there suddenly has a heart attack, causing Bean to panic. Seeking to help revive him, he attempts to pump air into his chest with his foot, tries mouth-to-mouth resuscitation using the man's magazine as a funnel, and then pours several of the man's pills down his throat, but these methods don't work. He eventually uses electric shock treatment by borrowing some <b>jump</b> <b>leads</b> and connecting them to a nearby lamppost. Although this initially works, Bean forgets to remove the <b>jump</b> <b>leads</b> from his hands when the man offers a handshake, thereby electrocuting him and causing him to pass out. Fleeing the scene, Bean watches as an ambulance arrives, and decides to use its battery to jumpstart the Mini.

Trajectories of these two types are demarcated in the phase space by a separatrix. Crossings of the separatrix result in jumps of the adiabatic invariant.

40|$|How do {{learning}} processes {{escape from}} local optima? Doing so requires {{an exploration of}} the landscape at a range of the order of the landscape correlation length [...] a "long jump" in synapsis space. This brings up a dilemma: because of the high dimensionality of this space, the probability that a random long <b>jump</b> <b>lead</b> to a better optimum is nearly zero. We conjecture that "intelligent" coarse-grained learning operators emerge as a consequence of a self-organization process in neural systems, as follows. The presentation of a single new data vector stimulates the recall of other vectors, each of which generates a small displacement in synapsis space. The sum of these displacements constitutes a coarsegrained learning event. Although long jumps are occasionally needed to escape from local optima, they should be {{the exception rather than the}} rule. This leads us to propose a neural network model where the recall process self-organizes to a critical state and one has a power-law distribution in the number of data vectors recalled...|$|R
