40|$|Up-to-date meta-databases {{are vital}} for the <b>analysis</b> of <b>biological</b> data. However,the current {{exponential}} increase in biological data leads to exponentially increasing meta-database sizes. Large-scale meta-database management is therefore an important challenge for production platforms providing services for <b>biological</b> data <b>analysis.</b> In particular, {{there is often}} a need either to run an analysis with a particular version of a meta-database, or to rerun an analysis with an updated meta-database. We present our GeStore approach for biological meta-database management. It provides efficient storage and runtime generation of specific meta-database versions, and efficient incremental updates for <b>biological</b> data <b>analysis</b> tools. The approach is transparent to the tools, and we provide a framework that makes it easy to integrate GeStore with <b>biological</b> data <b>analysis</b> frameworks.

40|$|Abstract Background Biological imaging is an {{emerging}} field, covering {{a wide range}} of applications in biological and clinical research. However, while machinery for automated experimenting and data acquisition has been developing rapidly in the past years, automated image analysis often introduces a bottleneck in high content screening. Methods Wndchrm is an open source utility for <b>biological</b> image <b>analysis.</b> The software works by first extracting image content descriptors from the raw image, image transforms, and compound image transforms. Then, the most informative features are selected, and the feature vector of each image is used for classification and similarity measurement. Results Wndchrm has been tested using several publicly available biological datasets, and provided results which are favorably comparable to the performance of task-specific algorithms developed for these datasets. The simple user interface allows researchers who are not knowledgeable in computer vision methods and have no background in computer programming to apply image analysis to their data. Conclusion We suggest that wndchrm can be effectively used for {{a wide range of}} <b>biological</b> image <b>analysis</b> tasks. Using wndchrm can allow scientists to perform automated <b>biological</b> image <b>analysis</b> while avoiding the costly challenge of implementing computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms. </p...|$|R
