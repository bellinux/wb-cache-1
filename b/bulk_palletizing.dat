40|$|It is the {{responsibility}} of the glass container industry to supply wide mouth and narrow neck glass containers to the various glass packers and bottlers in the food and beverage industry. The majority of this glass is shipped to these packers and bottlers in a corrugated carton, normally a one dozen carton with partition. This same carton is then used to ship the filled container to the ultimate customer. However, many large packers (and bottlers) have found a better method that can significantly reduce costs. This method is referred to as <b>bulk</b> glass <b>palletizing.</b> This method entails automatically placing the closely nested glass containers on a pallet with only a chipboard sheet separating each layer. The pallet loads are then strapped and/or shrink wrapped in plastic film. While there can be some labor savings for the glass maker and packer/bottler, the major savings usually occur in permitting glass-to-glass packaging of the final product. This is simply packing the product in a tight fitting carton without partitions thus eliminating the cost of partitions and reducing the size (and cost) of the corrugated carton. However, before any packer/bottler can decide whether <b>bulk</b> glass <b>palletizing</b> is feasible, many other savings and cost factors must also be considered. It is the purpose of this article to demonstrate a method, using the decision flow process, by which this feasibility can be determined. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R
50|$|Seatrain Puerto Rico was {{the first}} of the heavy sea-lift ships {{completed}} in 1966, followed by Seatrain Carolina, Seatrain Florida, Seatrain Maryland, Seatrain Maine, Seatrain Washington and Seatrain Ohio in 1967. The ships were equipped with two cranes for self-loading and unloading and could carry general <b>bulk</b> and <b>palletized</b> cargo, intermodal containers, and vehicles. The lower and main decks also had embedded rails to allow for carrying railcars, although there is no evidence that any of the ships were ever employed as railcar carriers per se, except for transporting some narrow-gauge rolling stock to Vietnam, in which case the standard-gauge rails could not be used. Elevated spar decks provided additional carrying space for vehicles, aircraft and containers.|$|R
50|$|The {{quantity}} of inflation air may be varied {{in accordance with}} the particular properties and requirements of the package contents. Dunnage bags are commercially available in various sizes and designs, ranging from spheres, standard cushions to corner and edge cushioning and tubular cushioning. Dunnage bags can be used to stabilize, secure, and protect cargo during all sorts of transportation. Dunnage bags are placed in the void between the cargo. Dunnage bags can be used in all modes of transportation. Besides being usable in all modes of transportation, almost every type of cargo can be secured with the use of dunnage bags, including break <b>bulk</b> and <b>palletized</b> cargo, coils, barrels, cases, and crates.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} sold to the Hudson Waterways Corporation on 3 May 1966 and renamed Seatrain Florida. She was {{subsequently}} lengthened using part of the mid section of another T2 tanker, the Fruitvale Hills, and rebuilt by Newport News Shipbuilding into one of seven Seatrain Lines multi-purpose cargo ships capable of carrying general <b>bulk</b> and <b>palletized</b> cargo, intermodal containers, vehicles and rail cars. Upon completion of the conversion and delivery in March 1967 Seatrain Florida, IMO 6119807, was chartered to the MSTS in support of overseas U.S. military operations, including the transport of material, equipment and aircraft to Vietnam. The ship {{was transferred to the}} National Defense Reserve Fleet (James River) in October 1974 and on August 8, 1978 her name was changed to just Florida. The ship was retired and broken up in 1986.|$|R

50|$|Moving {{floor is}} a hydraulically-driven moving-floor {{conveyance}} system for moving <b>bulk</b> material or <b>palletized</b> product, {{which can be}} used in a warehouse, loading dock or semi-trailer. It automates and facilitates loading and unloading of palletized goods by eliminating the need for a forklift to enter the trailer. In a truck-based application, the system can quickly unload loose material without having to tip the trailer or tilt the floor as with other dumping systems. In a bulk material application such as a waste facility, these systems can reduce double handling by allowing any vehicle to deliver material to the conveying floor and move heavy bulk materials to subsequent stages of a process. For bagged waste, the system can also be combined with bag openers.|$|R
