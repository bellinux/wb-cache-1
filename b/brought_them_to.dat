5|$|In February 2011, Marvel Comics {{launched}} the eight-issue digital comic Captain America: First Vengeance, {{on the same}} day as the first trailer aired. Written by Fred Van Lente and featuring a rotation of artists, the story is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Each of the eight issues focuses on a specific character from the movie, heroes and villains alike, and what <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the point where the movie begins.|$|E
5|$|NOI {{leaders were}} angry that Clarence13X freely taught {{portions}} of their doctrine that they only revealed to committed members; although one of their captains repeatedly asked him to stop, he refused. Clarence13X also experienced conflict within his family: his children did not revere him, and hostility quickly developed between core Five Percenters {{and some of his}} sons when Willeen Jowers <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> visit him.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best {{regularly}} {{performed at}} different clubs in Hamburg, Northern Germany, {{during the period}} from August 1960 to December 1962; a chapter in the group's history which honed their performance skills, widened their reputation, and led to their first recording, which <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the attention of Brian Epstein.|$|E

In 2001, PiscesV collected {{samples of the}} organisms and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the surface for study.|$|E
5|$|Butthole Surfers did {{not seek}} to replace her at the time, and opted to {{continue}} as a quartet. Following a final EP for Touch and Go—1989's Widowermaker—the band left their longtime recording partners to sign with longtime supporter Terry Tolkin at Rough Trade Records who had also <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Touch and Go, for a reportedly generous one-album deal. Prior to the new LP's debut, Rough Trade talked the band into first releasing 1990s The Hurdy Gurdy Man, which previewed material from the coming release. The same year, Rough Trade issued Digital Dump by The Jackofficers, Haynes and Pinkus's psychedelic house music side project.|$|E
5|$|Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} South Sandwich Islands. There {{was a heavy}} swell, such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its gunwales below the waves, filling the waist with water. As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan {{at the end of}} January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the edge of the pack ice on 4 February.|$|E

5|$|When Beyoncé was eight, she and {{childhood}} friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They were placed {{into a group}} called Girl's Tyme with three other girls, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R producer Arne Frager <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mansur in the {{meantime}} used his time more effectively: he mobilized troops in Syria and Iran and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Iraq, and recalled Isa ibn Musa from Medina to lead them. Finally, Ibrahim decided to march on Kufa, but on the way he abandoned this plan and turned back. Instead of returning to Basra, however, he encamped at Bakhamra, a location on the road between the two cities. There, on 21 January, Ibrahim with his troops, reduced by defections to some 15,000 men, confronted the Abbasid army under Isa ibn Musa. Isa's vanguard was at first beaten, but the battle ended in a crushing Abbasid victory. Ibrahim himself was heavily wounded and escaped {{with a handful of}} supporters. He died of his wounds on 14 February 763, signalling the end of the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a chance {{encounter}} in late spring 1968, according to some accounts, drummer Dennis Wilson was driving through Malibu when he picked up two hitchhiking women of the Manson Family, Patricia Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey, and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> his house in Pacific Palisades for a few hours. Returning home in the morning of the following day from a night time recording session with The Beach Boys, Wilson was unexpectedly greeted in the driveway of the residence by the Family's leader, Charles Manson. At first, Wilson was frightened by Manson, but Manson assured him he came with no intent to harm Wilson and began kissing his shoes. The two struck a friendship and, over the next few months, members of the Manson Familymostly women who were treated as servantswere housed at Wilson's Sunset Boulevard household, reportedly costing him approximately $100,000 (U.S.).|$|E

5|$|Budapest fell on 13 February. Hitler ordered Dietrich's 6th SS Panzer Army to {{move into}} Hungary to protect the Nagykanizsa oilfields and refineries, which he deemed the most {{strategically}} valuable fuel reserves on the Eastern Front. Frühlingserwachsen (Operation Spring Awakening), the final German offensive in the east, took place in early March. German forces attacked near Lake Balaton, with 6th SS Panzer Army advancing north towards Budapest and 2nd Panzer Army moving east and south. Dietrich's forces at first made good progress, but as they drew near the Danube, the combination of muddy terrain and strong Soviet resistance <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a halt. By 16 March the battle was lost. Enraged by the defeat, Hitler ordered the Waffen-SS units involved to remove their cuff titles as a mark of disgrace. Dietrich refused {{to carry out the}} order.|$|E
5|$|In 1793 at the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolutionary Wars, Curtis returned to Queen Charlotte and joined Lord Howe {{at the head of the}} Channel Fleet. In May 1794, Howe led the fleet to sea to search for a French grain convoy and after a month of fruitless searching, discovered that the French Atlantic Fleet under Villaret de Joyeuse had left harbour and was sailing to meet the convoy. Howe gave chase and gradually closed on Villaret's rearguard, fighting two inconclusive actions during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794. On 1 June 1794, Howe caught the French fleet and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> battle in the battle of the Glorious First of June. The action was hard fought and Curtis' ship was heavily engaged, fighting several French ships of the line simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{the band}} started {{work on their}} next album, Night in the Ruts. Aerosmith decided to go on tour during {{a break in the}} {{recording}} schedule but tensions within the band were slowly coming to a head. The band's touring schedule <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Cleveland Stadium on July 28, 1979, where they headlined the World Series of Rock festival. In a heated argument backstage, Joe Perry's wife, Elissa, threw a glass of milk at Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry. Following the show, Tyler and Perry got into a heated argument when Tyler confronted Perry about his wife's antics, and after the course of the argument Perry quit the band and left (while Tyler claims in his autobiography that he fired Perry from the band). In leaving, Perry took some of the music that he had written with him. Shortly after his departure Perry formed a new band called the Joe Perry Project.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Beyoncé Knowles met rapper LaTavia Roberson while {{auditioning for}} a girl group. Based in Houston, Texas, they were joined to a group that {{performed}} rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles' house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Támar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor. With Knowles and Rowland, Girl's Tyme attracted nationwide attention: west-coast R producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles' vocals because Frager thought she had personality {{and the ability to}} sing. With efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time. However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, their choice of song was wrong; they were actually rapping instead of singing.|$|E
5|$|In August 1718, Bonnet {{anchored}} the Royal James on an estuary of the Cape Fear River {{to careen}} and repair the ship. In late August and September, Colonel William Rhett, with the authorization of South Carolina governor Robert Johnson, led a naval expedition against pirates on the river. Rhett and Bonnet's men fought {{each other for}} hours, but the outnumbered pirates ultimately surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Charles Town in early October. Bonnet escaped on 24October, but was recaptured on Sullivan's Island. On 10November, Bonnet was brought to trial and charged with two acts of piracy. Judge Nicholas Trott sentenced Bonnet to death. Bonnet wrote to Governor Johnson to ask for clemency, but Johnson endorsed the judge's decision, and Bonnet was hanged in Charles Town on 10December 1718.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} Marlborough {{the rest of}} the van had mixed success. HMS Bellerophon and HMS Leviathan were both still {{suffering}} the effects of their exertions earlier in the week and did not breach the enemy line. Instead they pulled along the near side of Éole and America respectively and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> close gunnery duels. Rear-Admiral Thomas Pasley of Bellerophon was an early casualty, losing a leg in the opening exchanges. HMS Royal Sovereign, Graves's flagship, was less successful due to a miscalculation of distance that resulted in her pulling up too far from the French line and coming under heavy fire from her opponent Terrible. In the time it took to engage Terrible more closely, Royal Sovereign suffered a severe pounding and Admiral Graves was badly wounded.|$|E

5|$|Kelendria Trene Rowland {{was born}} on February 11, 1981, in Atlanta, Georgia. She is the {{daughter}} of Doris Rowland Garrison (December 6, 1947 – December 2, 2014) and Christopher Lovett. Kelly has an older brother named Orlando. When she was seven, her mother took her and left her father, who was an abusive alcoholic. At the age of eight, she relocated to Houston. In 1992, Rowland joined a girl group, originally named Girl's Tyme. Rowland's addition made it a six-member group. West coast R producer, Arne Frager, flew to Houston to see them and eventually <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> his studio, The Plant Recording Studio, in Northern California. As part of efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major label record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut them on Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at that time. They participated, but lost the competition.|$|E
5|$|The koala is {{featured}} in the Dreamtime stories and mythology of indigenous Australians. The Tharawal people believed that the animal helped row the boat that <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the continent. Another myth tells of how a tribe killed a koala and used its long intestines to create a bridge for people {{from other parts of}} the world. This narrative highlights the koala's status as a game animal and the length of its intestines. Several stories tell of how the koala lost its tail. In one, a kangaroo cuts it off to punish the koala for being lazy and greedy. Tribes in both Queensland and Victoria regarded the koala as a wise animal and sought its advice. Bidjara-speaking people credited the koala for turning barren lands into lush forests. The animal is also depicted in rock carvings, though not as much as some other species.|$|E
5|$|Although Jones took {{no part in}} {{the raising}} of his {{children}} by Tuhbenahneequay, he did take an active interest in their welfare. In 1805, he secured a pair of two-square-mile plots of land {{near the mouth of}} the Credit River for his two sons from the local Mississauga Indians, but the government of Upper Canada would not recognise the title. In 1816, Jones feared that the Mississauga band his sons John and Peter lived with would fall apart, {{in the aftermath of the}} War of 1812, the famine of 1816's harvest and the influx of settlers to the area in recent years. Jones travelled to find the boys, and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> his farm in Stoney Creek. He arranged for the boys to be schooled in Stoney Creek, as neither spoke much English. After nine months, Jones felt that Peter's command of English was sufficient, and took him out of school to teach him the farming craft. The next year, Jones and his family relocated to land along the Grand River, and Jones brought his son Peter with them. Peter lived with his father for seven years there.|$|E
