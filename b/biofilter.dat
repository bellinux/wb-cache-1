25|$|The {{biological}} load, or bioload, is {{a measure}} of the burden placed on the aquarium ecosystem by its inhabitants. High biological loading presents a more complicated tank ecology, which in turn means that equilibrium is easier to upset. Several fundamental constraints on biological loading depend on aquarium size. The water's surface area limits oxygen intake. The bacteria population depends on the physical space they have available to colonize. Physically, only a limited size and number of plants and animals can fit into an aquarium while still providing room for movement. Biologically, biological loading refers to the rate of biological decay in proportion to tank volume. Adding plants to an aquarium will sometimes help greatly with taking up fish waste as plant nutrients. Although an aquarium can be overloaded with fish, an excess of plants is unlikely to cause harm. Decaying plant material, such as decaying plant leaves, can add these nutrients back into the aquarium if not promptly removed. The bioload is processed by the aquarium's <b>biofilter</b> filtration system.|$|E

This building is very different among the rest of the university’s buildings as its structure and characteristics are very eco-friendly. Some features that the building includes are: construction materials that were chosen due to their recycled content, a living wall that is five stories tall and composed of numerous plants that with act as an air filtration system, and a green roof. The green wall is the tallest living <b>biofilter</b> wall in North America. The wall is situated in the main agora of the Faculty of Social Science building and is visible from the outside. The green wall is a unique component of the building’s air handling system, for it is capable of treating a large quantity of air at a time, and it provides a source of humidity that doesn’t need to be artificially introduced.|$|E

Laboratory scale <b>biofilters</b> {{were filled with}} a mixture of peat, bark and wood and inoculated with a mixed microbial population. Toluene and xylene were applied both as single pollutants and as mixtures. Attention was focused on the evaluation of the following transients: the response of <b>biofilters</b> to step changes and peaks in pollutant concentrations, the effect of changes between single and multiple pollutant loadings and the response to shutdown periods. The <b>biofilters</b> demonstrated a good dynamic stability during transient states induced by changes in inlet pollutant concentrations. Their time periods did not exceed three hours. No interaction between xylene and toluene degradation was observed during changes in loading with single pollutants or their mixture. The performance interruptions lasting less than 24 hours were found to have no significant influence on the removal efficiency of <b>biofilters.</b> When the <b>biofilters</b> were reacclimated after longer starvation periods, a short temporary decrease in efficiency whose minimum and duration were proportional to the length of a preceding shutdown period was observed.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to investigate three packing materials (polyurethane foam, sugar-cane bagasse, and coconut fibre) for biofiltration of a gaseous mixture containing hydrogen sulphide (H(2) S).

The empty bed residence time was 495 {{for each of the}} <b>biofilters.</b> The reactors were operated simultaneously, and the inlet concentrations of H(2) S varied between 184 and 644 ppmv during the long-term continuous operation of the <b>biofilters</b> (100 clays). Average removal efficiencies remained above 99. 3 %, taking into consideration the entire period of operation.

The paper {{focuses on}} the {{operation}} of a pilot plant with four <b>biofilters</b> operated in parallel for determining the suitability of coconut fiber, peat, compost from the digested sludge of a wastewater treatment plant and pine leaves as packing materials for biofiltration of toluene.

Biological activity and packing capabilities related to toluene removal were determined during the startup and operation of the four <b>biofilters</b> under different conditions of nutrients, watering and inlet air relative humidity supply. Nutrient addition was key in improving removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC) of <b>biofilters.</b> Feeding of medium with nutrients increased the RE and the EC {{by a factor of}} 2 to 4 than these found when supplying only tap water.
