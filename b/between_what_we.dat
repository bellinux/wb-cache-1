25|$|A link <b>between</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{now know}} as the {{sympathetic}} system and the lung was shown in 1887 when Grossman showed that stimulation of cardiac accelerator nerves reversed muscarine induced airway constriction. In elegant experiments in the dog, where the sympathetic chain was cut {{at the level of}} the diaphragm, Jackson showed that there was no direct sympathetic innervation to the lung, but that bronchoconstriction was reversed by release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla. An increased incidence of asthma has not been reported for adrenalectomized patients; those with a predisposition to asthma will have some protection from airway hyper-reactivity from their corticosteroid replacement therapy. Exercise induces progressive airway dilation in normal subjects that correlates with work load and is not prevented by beta blockade. The progressive dilation of the airway with increasing exercise is mediated by a progressive reduction in resting vagal tone. Beta blockade with propranolol causes a rebound in airway resistance after exercise in normal subjects over the same time course as the bronchoconstriction seen with exercise induced asthma. The reduction in airway resistance during exercise reduces the work of breathing.|$|E

Anderegg wrote that this, {{in combination with}} Welles' fast-paced camera movements and editing, makes the Shakespearean dialogue more difficult to understand. Many scenes are shot in long shots or with character's backs facing the camera, most likely for practical purposes when actors were not present, creating more sound problems. [...] "In effect," [...] Anderegg writes, [...] "Welles generates a constant tension <b>between</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> see and what we hear, a tension that points to the ambiguous status of language in its relation to action."

500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency <b>between</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E

2500|$|The Canadian shield, Precambrian shield, {{makes up}} the bedrock geology {{highlighted}} by rocks and lakes and a boreal forest area. [...] There are transitional areas between boreal and tundra flora. The lower boundary of the Canadian Shield cuts across the province diagonally from the latitude 57 degrees in the north west to 54 degrees in the south east. [...] Three orogenies formed the Precambrian shield, the Kenoran (Laurentian-Algoman), Hudsonian (Penokean) and Grenville Orogeny. [...] Between 2.2 and 2.5 billion years ago was the Kenoran Orogeny, which was overlain by the Hudsonian Orogeny 1700 to 1900 million years ago. [...] The earth was experiencing hotter and more volatile Archean tectonics, evidencing island arc volcanic activity and mountain building. The Trans-Hudson Orogen occurred when a number of Archean continental blocks came together, including the Superior Craton from the southeast and Hearne-Rae craton from the northwest. [...] A microcontinent named the Sask Craton was underlain in this collision zone. [...] The Canadian Grenville province occurred between 1080 and 980 Ma and {{did not affect the}} geology of the Canadian Shield in Saskatchewan.

[...] Over the drum-heavy sample, Lamar and Bobby Ray join T.I. in sharing some nostalgic stories, which he says reminds him of some of a few renowned MCs and their classic projects: [...] " [...] taking turns on our story about a female that we knew years, years, years ago before we were who we are today. It kinda puts me in the mind of the 'Da Art Of Storytellin' [...] from Outkast and Slick Rick. It puts me in the mind of that."

There are similarities between most of the teachers but also differences <b>between</b> them. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> can learn from the study is that communication between teacher and student is aimed at ultimate weight and especially the verbal communication.

While current theories of grammar suggest a highly modular, abstract, language universal characterisation of linguistic competence, traditional models of performance have postulated parsing strategies based on construction-oriented, phrase-structure grammars. In contrast, we construct a principled theory of performance on the basis of cross-linguistic evidence, with the aim of shedding greater light on the relationship between grammar and processing. On the basis of Fodor's Modularity Hypothesis and a range of empirical evidence, we assume the existence of a distinct syntactic processor within the human sentence processor.

This research indicates that measures of accessibility should include not only commonly used factors such as socio-demographic variables and distance, but also the facilities available at various attractions, management and operational aspects relating to the attraction (<b>what</b> <b>we</b> term "functions"), and the infrastructure used to move <b>between</b> specific attractions (<b>what</b> <b>we</b> term "connectivity of networks").

60|$|So {{with other}} fabrics of human thought, {{imagination}} has been spinning and weaving them all.

We are too prone to regard the present age of the world as preeminently practical, much as a middle-aged man laments the witching fancies of his boyhood. But, and there is more in the parallel than analogy, if the man be truly imaginative he is none the less so at forty-five than he was at twenty, if his imagination have taken on a more critical form; for this latter {{half of the nineteenth century}} is perhaps the most imaginative period the world's history has ever known.

And therefore the consciences of men will cry for pardon, just in proportion as they are worthy of the name of men, and not merely a superior sort of animals; and therefore just in proportion as our souls are alive in us, alive with the feeling of duty, of justice, of purity, of love, of a just and orderly God above--just in that proportion shall we be tormented by the difference <b>between</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are, and what we ought to be; and the sense of sin, and the longing for pardon, will be more keen in us; and we shall have no rest till the sins are got rid of, and the pardon sure. That is the price we pay for having immortal souls. It is a heavy price truly: but it is well worth the paying, if it be only paid aright. If that tormenting feeling of being continually wrong in this life, ends by making us continually right for ever in the world to come; if Christ be formed in us at last; if out of our sinful and mortal manhood a sinless and immortal manhood is born;--then shall we, like the mother over her new-born babe, forget our anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.|$|E
