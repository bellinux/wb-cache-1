5|$|<b>Bellows,</b> hydraulic-powered: Although it {{is unknown}} if metallurgic <b>bellows</b> (i.e. air-blowing device) in the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) were of the leather bag type or the wooden fan type found in the later Yuan Dynasty (1279–1368), the Eastern Han {{politician}} Du Shi (d. 38 AD) applied the use of rotating waterwheels to power the <b>bellows</b> of his blast furnace smelting iron, a method which continued in use in China thereafter, as evidenced by subsequent records; it is a significant invention in that iron production yields were increased and it employed all the necessary components for converting rotary motion into reciprocating motion.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Bellew</b> Baronetcy, of Barmeath in the County of Louth, {{was created}} in the Baronetage of Ireland on 11 December 1688 for the first Baron Bellew's great-great-grandfather Patrick <b>Bellew.</b> His brother Christopher <b>Bellew</b> was the {{ancestor}} of the Grattan-Bellew Baronets, of Mount <b>Bellew,</b> a title created in 1838.|$|R

5|$|One model had its lens {{fixed to}} a bag <b>bellows.</b> A scissor {{mechanism}} held the <b>bellows</b> in its expanded state until {{the photo was}} taken, but condensed it immediately afterwards.

5|$|Playing {{the organ}} before {{electricity}} required {{at least one}} person to operate the <b>bellows.</b> When signaled by the organist, a calcant would operate a set of <b>bellows,</b> supplying the organ with air. Because calcants were expensive, organists would usually practise on other instruments such as the clavichord or harpsichord. By the mid-19th-century <b>bellows</b> were also being operated by water engines, steam engines or gasoline engines. Starting in the 1860s <b>bellows</b> were gradually replaced by wind turbines which were later directly connected to electrical motors. This made it possible for organists to practice regularly on the organ. Most organs, both new and historic, have electric blowers, although others can still be operated manually. The wind supplied is stored in one or more regulators to maintain a constant pressure in the windchests until the action allows it to flow into the pipes.|$|E
5|$|While {{acting as}} {{administrator}} of Nanyang in 31 CE, Du Shi (d. 38 CE) invented a water-powered reciprocator which worked the <b>bellows</b> {{of the blast}} furnace and cupola furnace in smelting iron; before this invention, intensive manual labor was required to work the <b>bellows.</b>|$|E

5|$|Henry Whitney <b>Bellows</b> {{determined}} {{to take a}} different approach, establishing a civilian organization of nurses separate from the U.S. Army. <b>Bellows</b> was the founder of the United States Sanitary Commission and served as its only president. An influential minister, born and raised in Boston, <b>Bellows</b> went to Washington in May 1861 as head of a delegation of physicians representing the Women's Central Relief Association of New York and other organizations. Bellows's aim was to convince the government to establish a civilian auxiliary branch of the Army Medical Bureau. The Sanitary Commission, established by President Lincoln on June 13, 1861, provided nurses (mostly female) with medical supplies and organized hospital ships and soldiers' homes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bellew,</b> later Grattan-Bellew Baronetcy, of Mount <b>Bellew</b> in County Galway, is a {{title in}} the Baronetage of the United Kingdom.

Thomas <b>Bellew,</b> younger son of the first Baronet, sat as Member of Parliament for County Galway. He married Pauline, daughter of Henry Grattan. Their son, the third Baronet, assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Grattan. As of 2014 the title is held by the latter's grandson, the fifth Baronet, who succeeded his father in 1948. He is a journalist, radio and television broadcaster and publisher.|$|R

Blount owned several corporations and one, the Green Mountain Railroad (GMRC), controlled the tracks that lay between Walpole, <b>Bellows</b> Falls and Chester, Vermont, which Steamtown was to use for its excursions.

5|$|The {{technology}} {{required for}} blast furnaces may have either been transferred from China, or {{may have been}} an indigenous innovation. Al-Qazvini in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian Sea. This is close to the silk route, so that the use of technology derived from China is conceivable. Much later descriptions record blast furnaces about three metres high. As the Varangian Rus' people from Scandinavia traded with the Caspian (using their Volga trade route, {{it is possible that the}} technology reached Sweden by this means. High quality ores, water power for <b>bellows</b> for blast and wood for charcoal are readily obtainable in Sweden. However, since blast furnace has also been invented independently in Africa by the Haya people, it is more likely the process has been invented in Scandinavia independently. The step from bloomery to true blast furnace is not big. Simply just building a bigger furnace and using bigger <b>bellows</b> to increase the volume of the blast and hence the amount of oxygen leads inevitably into higher temperatures, bloom melting into liquid iron and, cast iron flowing from the smelters. Already the Vikings are known to have used double <b>bellows,</b> which greatly increases the volumetric flow of the blast.|$|E
