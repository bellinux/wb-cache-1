50|$|A common <b>breeding</b> <b>practice</b> for pet dogs is mating between close {{relatives}} (e.g. between half- and full siblings). In {{a study of}} seven different French breeds of dogs (Bernese mountain dog, basset hound, Cairn terrier, Epagneul Breton, German Shepherd dog, Leonberger, and West Highland white terrier) {{it was found that}} inbreeding decreases litter size and survival. Another analysis of data on 42,855 dachshund litters, found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the relationships between}} <b>breeding</b> <b>practices</b> and carcass characteristics, and between <b>breeding</b> <b>practices</b> and Longissimus Thoracis (LT) muscle characteristics, a data set obtained from 262 cattles was analyzed. In total, 27 variables on <b>breeding</b> <b>practices</b> during the fattening period, the carcass, and LT characteristics, were studied. There were high correlations between the carcass weight and composition (muscles, fat and skeleton) with cattle live weight. Differences appeared {{between male and female}} cattle. For male cattle, carcass weight and composition were highly correlated with feeding source during the fattening period whereas no high correlations were observed for female. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in LT was highly correlated with <b>breeding</b> <b>practices.</b> LDH activity was negatively correlated with forage amount in the fattening diet and positively with concentrate amount. Furthermore, LDH activity was correlated with the duration of fattening period only for male cattle...|$|R

50|$|Looking at {{all this}} it also becomes clear, why an {{international}} acceptance of this breed by the FCI is not regarded as being very desirable {{by the majority of}} hortaya aficionados. The breed's <b>breeding</b> <b>practice,</b> its consolidated state and its truly extreme phenotypical diversity do not really fit into the actual breeding and judging practices of today's FCI or of any other major kynological federation. Any international FCI acceptance which would not result in immediate harm to the breed needs major, important groundwork and decades of preparation. Currently the direct and immediate consequence would be the undesirable separation into show and work lines, and into western and original hortaya.|$|E

50|$|A {{study done}} by Cornell University Veterinary School looked at 1,498 dogs from Guiding Eyes for the Blind. The study was {{interested}} in the measurement of hip joint quality. Cornell found a complex generation from a family of Labrador Retrievers. This included 1,236 connected dogs over 17 generations from a particular male dog. The results of selective breeding were evident in the relationship between breeding values and their accuracy. Over half of the Labrador Retrievers were bred at the Guiding Eyes for the Blind facility. Dogs with more accurate breeding values produced more progeny, with clustering of breeding values with higher accuracy indicative of better hip joint confirmation. This indicates that the selective <b>breeding</b> <b>practice</b> of Guiding Eyes for the Blind program are effective in improving hip joint confirmation in dogs. Overall the study confirmed that the selection of dogs for hip joint quality resulted in genetic improvement predominantly in the last 10 to 15 years.|$|E
5000|$|... "Manx syndrome" [...] or [...] "Manxness" [...] is a colloquial name {{given to}} the {{condition}} which results when the tailless gene shortens the spine too much. It can seriously damage the spinal cord and the nerves, causing a form of spina bifida, as well as problems with the bowels, bladder, and digestion. Very small bladders are indicative of the disease, and {{it is often difficult}} to diagnose. Death can occur quite suddenly, and some live for only 3-4 years; the oldest recorded was 5 years when affected with the disease. In one report, it was shown to affect about 30% of Manx cats studied, but nearly all of those cases were rumpies, which exhibit the most extreme phenotype. Such problems can be avoided by breeding rumpy Manx cats with stumpy specimens, and this <b>breeding</b> <b>practice</b> is responsible for a decline in spinal problems among modern, professionally bred Manx cats today. Most pedigreed cats are not placed until four months of age (to make sure that they are properly socialised) and this usually also gives adequate time for any such health problems to be identified. Feline expert Roger Tabor has stated: [...] "Only the fact that the Manx is a historic breed stops us being as critical of this dangerous gene as of other more recent selected abnormalities." ...|$|E

40|$|This work {{sets out}} a methodological {{approach}} {{to assess the}} relationships that exist between four sets of data: <b>breeding</b> <b>practices,</b> carcass characteristics, m. Longissimus thoracis biomarkers and m. Semitendinosus biomarkers. Seventy-one young bulls of 3 breeds were characterized by 78 variables. The variables in each set were arranged into 4, 3, 5 and 3 homogeneous clusters respectively using the clustOfVar approach. A second clustering of variables established from these 15 clusters was then used to build 5 pools of clusters that were precisely described to characterize {{the interaction between the}} 4 sets of variables. Some practices have a universal impact on biomarker patterns eg. increasing straw proportion in the diet leads to an increase in MyLC- 1 F and Hsp 40 biomarkers whatever the breed and the muscle. Nevertheless, most <b>breeding</b> <b>practices</b> appear to have varying impacts on biomarkers depending on animal type and muscle. For example, ST biomarkers are less related to <b>breeding</b> <b>practices</b> and/or carcass characteristics than in LT. Moreover, some biomarker expressions appear to be breed-dependant, especially for the Angus breed which is very specific in comparison to continental breeds. The breed where muscle biomarkers are the most closely linked to <b>breeding</b> <b>practices</b> and carcass characteristics is the Blonde d’Aquitaine. In this breed, MDH 1 and DJ- 1 biomarkers are positively linked to muscle yield and carcass development in both muscles and some other LT biomarkers might also be considered as good indicators of carcass fatness (small Hsp, ENO 3, Capz-β, MyBP-H) ...|$|R
30|$|Although {{a number}} of male {{sterility}} lines have been reported, most of them cannot be used in <b>breeding</b> <b>practice</b> mainly due to incomplete male sterility, poor agronomic traits, or poor general combining ability (GCA). For instance, Anitha and Ganesan (2000) obtained three chemical-induced completely sterile plants, with no or sterile pollen. However, these plants show general reduction in the values of all biometrical characters compared to wild parent. The new sterile line developed in present study, although also being classified as recessive GMS, has {{a number of}} advantages when compared to previous ones. Being developed from a spontaneous mutant in Zhuzhi 4, a widely used cultivar in China, D 248 A has very good agronomic performance such as growth vigor, long BD (Table  2) and high GCA (unpublished data), which can be directly used in <b>breeding</b> <b>practice.</b> Currently, four F 1 hybrids with 47 - 142 % yield advantage over check variety have been developed from D 248 A (Table  3), which will be further tested in National Regional Trail.|$|E
