5|$|The common {{chiffchaff}} breeds across Europe and Asia east {{to eastern}} Siberia and north to about 70°N, with isolated populations in northwest Africa, northern and western Turkey and northwestern Iran. It is migratory, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> {{of the first}} passerine birds to return to its breeding areas {{in the spring and}} among the last to leave in late autumn. When breeding, it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes. These trees are typically at least 5metres (16ft) high, with undergrowth that is an open, poor to medium mix of grasses, bracken, nettles or similar plants. Its breeding habitat is quite specific, and even near relatives do not share it; for example, the willow warbler (P. trochilus) prefers younger trees, while the wood warbler (P. sibilatrix) prefers less undergrowth. In winter, the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub, and is not so dependent on trees. It is often found near water, unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats. There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas, especially in coastal southern England and the mild urban microclimate of London. These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies abietinus and tristis, so they are certainly not all birds which have bred locally, although some undoubtedly are.|$|E
25|$|Biologists {{and other}} {{research}} scientists constantly monitor the welfare, living conditions, {{and health of}} reindeer, {{as well as the}} ecological health of their habitat, and they make recommendations and set quotas designed to ensure that game resources and natural biodiversity are protected, managed, and maintained. Many factors, some of them difficult to measure or predict, are analyzed including natural cycles, parasites, disease, short-term weather conditions (relative harshness of winter or summer), long-term climate changes, and condition of food sources. Hunting is not the only factor affecting reindeer welfare, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> area that can be managed to some degree.|$|E

25|$|Lithuania is {{not very}} well known for its beer, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the few {{countries}} in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence this process gathered speed, and soon {{there were more than}} 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown {{in the rest of the}} world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.|$|E

500|$|The film was, however, {{subject to}} a number of harsh reviews that {{expressed}} disapproval of its overblown style.

500|$|Rabies is {{an often}} fatal disease {{caused by the}} {{infection}} of mammals with rabies virus. In the 21st century it is mainly a disease that affects wild mammals such as [...] foxes and bats, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the oldest known virus diseases: rabies is a Sanskrit word (rabhas) that dates from 3000 BC, [...] which means [...] "madness" [...] or [...] "rage", and the disease {{has been known for}} over 4000years. Descriptions of rabies can be found in [...] Mesopotamian texts, and the ancient Greeks called it [...] "lyssa" [...] or [...] "lytta", meaning [...] "madness". [...] References to rabies {{can be found in the}} Laws of Eshnunna, which date from 2300BC.

Celsus, in the first century AD, first recorded the symptom called [...] and suggested that the saliva of infected animals and humans contained a slime or poison– to describe this he invented the [...] word [...] "virus". Rabies does not cause epidemics, but the infection was greatly feared because of its terrible symptoms, which include insanity, hydrophobia and death.|$|E
500|$|Some {{reception}} of the film, however, was much more positive, in particular by reviewers for horror outlets. Michael Gingold of Fangoria gave it two-and-half out of four skulls, while Jonathan Barkan of Bloody Disgusting gave it {{four out of five}} skulls, stating it [...] "isn’t a movie meant to scare or make you think <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the most entertaining and enjoyable movies of its kind that I’ve seen in years." [...] Scott Weinberg of FEARnet wrote that [...] "aside from some very clunky editorial missteps in the film's second half, there's a good deal of wit, enthusiasm, energy, and amusing attitude {{to be found in the}} dumb-yet-self-aware Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," [...] all while noting that he is [...] "not the type to act snobbish around a ridiculous film that obviously knows it's ridiculous." [...] According to Ryan Larson of Shock Till You Drop, the film [...] "is a mixed bag" [...] but [...] "fortunately, the lows don’t appear as often as you would think," [...] and, [...] "if taken at face value, Hansel & Gretel is well worth the view." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline, who criticized the film's inadequately [...] "limp" [...] marketing campaign, found the movie itself [...] "inherently stupid" [...] but in a good way, [...] "played with humor, ultraviolence and anachronistic fetish." [...] Cinema Blend's Sean O'Connell stated that the film is [...] "often mean and nasty, but that's really its saving grace." [...] Peter Paras of E! recommended this [...] "super violent, pretty funny flick" [...] for how it [...] "revels in the mayhem". Tom Russo of The Boston Globe, giving the film three out of five stars, called it a [...] "splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun." [...] Jonathon Natsis of Filmink wrote: [...] "Hansel and Gretel is not a 'film'. It's a 'movie', in all its unabashed, excitable glory...big on blood-soaked entertainment and low on pretension." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave it four out of five stars, stating: [...] "This has all the elements of a classic action flick, and it's destined for cult status. Welcome to the most fun movie of 2013." [...] DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich summed up: [...] "Is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters a good movie? Probably not. At least not in any way that is defensible by regular critical standards. Is it a hell of a good time? Absolutely so. Unabashedly so. That's all it wants to be." ...|$|E

In 1959, novelist Robertson Davies excused the narrator entirely, writing that the theme of Lolita is [...] "not the corruption of an innocent child by a cunning adult, but the exploitation of a weak adult by a corrupt child.

2500|$|When an {{electron}} and a hole {{are present in}} the same region, they may recombine or [...] "annihilate" [...] producing a spontaneous emission — i.e., the electron may re-occupy the energy state of the hole, emitting a photon with energy equal to the difference between the electron's original state and hole's state. (In a conventional semiconductor junction diode, the energy released from the recombination of electrons and holes is carried away as phonons, i.e., lattice vibrations, rather than as photons.)
