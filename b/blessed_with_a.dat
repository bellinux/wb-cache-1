25|$|The Puranas, Sangam {{literature}} and the Tirumurai canon join several epigraphs and murals in highlighting {{the brilliance of the}} temple site and the devotion of Patañjali, Vyaghrapada-Pulikaalmunivar and patanjali to Nataraja at Thillai. The sthala puranam as well as umapathi sivacharya's koyil puranam give an account of how an ancient chola prince of kritayugam or first of epochal ages. Worshipped The Lord's feet at Chidambaram and being <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vision of His was further helped by saint Vyaghrapada to consecrate a place of worship therewith. The temple murals and some cholan and pandyan literature refer to this sthala puranam. The chidambaram mahatyam as well as koyil puranam by the same author discuss as to how this prince who was presented with dhataki or atti garland and tiger flag in which Lord Indra would take abode to make him ever victorious was blessed with vision of lord and further attained mukti at this spot. This is very credible because all ancient {{literature and}} documents report that tiger flag and atti or dhataki (grislea tomentosa) garland as being emblematic with cholas. Some sangam period works also passingly refer to the krita age king's war with demons and his victory against them. The king also went by name Vyaghraketu after being gifted with the tiger flag.|$|E
25|$|The {{third day}} of play was <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bright and sunny weather, and the pitch {{remained}} an excellent one for batting. The pair of Dravid and Laxman began in a circumspect fashion, adding only 28 runs in 17 overs, {{a period in which}} the only noteworthy accomplishment made by either sides was Dravid's half-century, which he reached with a front-foot flick to square leg off Stuart MacGill's bowling in the penultimate ball of the 59th over. Not long afterward, in the 65th over, Dravid hit the first boundary of the morning by flicking a loose, low full-toss drifting towards leg-side from MacGill. VVS Laxman, facing the first ball after the drinks break, from Andy Bichel, was dropped by Ricky Ponting when he was batting on 65. The ball was short and nicely dug in, but Laxman tilted the face of the bat at an unusual angle, getting a thick edge towards slips, where Ponting dived full to his left, but was unable to latch on to the ball. Australia would go on to regret this mistake. Sunil Gavaskar noted that Laxman would have a sudden lapse of concentration after prolonged periods of good batting. The two batsmen grew in confidence, however, and they began to bat a little more freely, with Dravid driving every ball in the off-stump line towards extra cover or cover for a boundary, while Laxman use his wristy strokeplay and his good footwork to negotiate the odd ball which kept low, and often dragging off-stump deliveries towards leg-side. This was reminiscent of the way he handled Shane Warne in 2000–01 at Eden, where he hit 281 and along with Dravid, staged a comeback to give India a famous victory. At Lunch, India were securely placed at 252/4 from 83 overs. After lunch, the two batsmen began to stroke boundaries at will, going at a rate of a four every over for the first five overs after lunch, with the highlight of that passage of play being Dravid's century. He miscued a pull from Gillespie's short ball, but had hit it hard enough for it go over the backward-square leg ropes for a six. Then Laxman reached his century as well, in the 89th over, with a single towards mid-wicket, his sixth in tests and his third against Australia, the earlier two being 167 and 281.|$|E
