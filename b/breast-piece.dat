6000|$|... "Well, mother, how be you? I {{felt like}} a boy again, {{waking up in the}} old chamber. Where's my back and <b>breast-piece?</b> Have you a cup of ale, while I rub it up?" ...|$|E
25|$|Both of his biographers give a {{much more}} {{detailed}} account of the occurrence, evidently taken from a common source. The Frenchmen first sent over in a boat their banners, their arquebuses and pistols, swords and targets, and some helmets and <b>breast-pieces.</b> Then twenty Spaniards crossed in the boat and brought the now unarmed Frenchmen over the lagoon in parties of ten. They were subjected to no ill-treatment as they were ferried over, the Spaniards not wishing to arouse any suspicions among {{those who had not}} yet crossed. Men√©ndez himself withdrew some distance from the shore to the rear of a sand dune, where he was concealed from the view of the prisoners who were crossing in the boat.|$|R
60|$|They had no sudden {{attack to}} fear from lurking foes, for an act of Edward the First was still in force, by which every highway leading from one market-town to another was always to be kept clear, for two hundred feet on each side, of every ditch, tree, or bush in which a man might lurk to do harm; while, as any ill that {{happened}} to travellers was made payable by the township in which it occurred, {{there was a strong}} personal interest {{on the part of the}} inhabitants to suppress plundering bands in their neighbourhood. Both Edgar and Albert rode in partial armour, with steel caps and <b>breast-pieces,</b> it being an ordinance that all of gentle blood when travelling should do so, and they carried swords by their sides, and light axes at their saddle-bows.|$|R
60|$|Abradates {{immediately}} fitted up for Cyrus {{a hundred}} such chariots {{at his own}} expense, and provided horses to draw them from his own troop. He made one chariot {{much larger than the}} rest, for himself, as he intended to take command of this corps of chariots in person. His own chariot was to be drawn by eight horses. His wife Panthea was very much interested in these preparations. She wished to do something herself toward the outfit. She accordingly furnished, from her own private treasures, a helmet, a corslet, and arm-pieces of gold. These articles formed a suit of armor sufficient to cover all that part of the body which would be exposed in standing in the chariot. She also provided <b>breast-pieces</b> and side-pieces of brass for the horses. The whole chariot, thus equipped, with its eight horses in their gay trappings and resplendent armor, and with Abradates standing within it, clothed in his panoply of gold, presented, as it drove, in the sight of the whole army, around the plain of the encampment, a most imposing spectacle. It was a worthy leader, as the spectators thought, to head the formidable column of a hundred similar engines which were to follow in its train. If we imagine the havoc which a hundred scythe-armed carriages would produce when driven, with headlong fury, into dense masses of men, on a vast open plain, we shall have some idea of one item of the horrors of ancient war.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{looked and}} a thought came to me. Lifting the mummy, I thrust {{it into the}} sarcophagus, all of it save the gilded mask and the painted <b>breast-piece</b> of stiff linen. Then I laid myself down in the coffin, of which the lid, still lying crosswise, hid me to the waist, and drew the gilded mask and painted <b>breast-piece</b> {{over my head and}} bosom. Scarcely was it done when the {{soldiers}} entered. By now the reflected sunlight had faded from the place, leaving it in deep shadow; but some of the men held burning torches made from splinters of old coffins, that were full of pitch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] {{answered}} Myles, [...] "what thou sayest doth rejoice my very heart. Ne'theless, it is {{but just}} to say that both his <b>breast-piece</b> and over-girth were burst in the stitches before he ran his course, for so I saw with mine own eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I give thee gramercy for thy courtesy, my Lord," [...] {{answered}} Myles, {{speaking in}} French; [...] "and I will strive to encounter thee as best I may, and pardon me if I seem forward in so saying, but were I in thy place, my Lord, I would change me yon <b>breast-piece</b> and over-girth of my saddle; they are sprung in the stitches." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{said the}} Sieur de la Montaigne, laughing, [...] "breast-piece and over-girth have carried me through more tilts than one, and shall through this. An thou {{give me a}} blow so true as to burst <b>breast-piece</b> and over-girth, I will own myself fairly conquered by thee." [...] So saying, he saluted Myles with {{the butt of the}} spear he still held, and passed by to his end of the lists.|$|E
60|$|The young knights practised at tilting daily {{under the}} eye of Sir Ralph, {{and at the end}} of three months could carry off rings skilfully, and could couch their lances truly, whether at <b>breast-piece</b> or helm. It was nigh two years since they had first ridden to London, and both had grown tall and greatly widened. Edgar was still by far the taller and stronger, and was now an {{exceptionally}} powerful young man. Albert was of a fair strength and stature, and from his constant practice with Edgar, had attained almost as great a skill with his weapons. When they jousted they always used lighter spears than when they practised at the ring, for in a charge, Edgar's weight and strength would have carried Albert out of his saddle, and that with such force as might have caused him serious injury; the lances therefore were made so slight as to shiver at the shock.|$|E
60|$|The {{heat was}} terrific, but Cyril's helmet and <b>breast-piece</b> {{sheltered}} him somewhat; yet though he shielded {{his face with}} his arm, he felt that it would speedily become unbearable. His eye fell upon a coil of rope at his feet. Snatching it up, he fastened it to the tiller and then round a belaying-pin in the bulwark, caught up a bucket with a rope attached, threw it over the side and soused its contents over the tiller-rope, then, unbuckling the straps of his breast- and back-pieces, he threw them off, cast his helmet on the deck, blistering his hands as he did so, and leapt overboard. It was with a delicious sense of coolness that he rose to the surface and looked round. Hitherto he had been so scorched by the flame and smothered by the smoke that it was with difficulty he had kept his attention upon what he was doing, and would doubtless, in another minute, have fallen senseless. The plunge into the sea seemed to restore his faculties, and as he came up he looked eagerly to see how far success had attended his efforts.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{deemed it}} no harm to slip {{back to the}} {{vineyard}} where the Maid lay, and there I met the good Father Pasquerel, that was her confessor. He told me that now she was quiet, either praying or asleep, for he had left her as still as a babe in its cradle, her page watching her. The bolt had sped by a rivet of her <b>breast-piece,</b> clean through her breast hard below the shoulder, and it stood a hand-breadth out beyond. Then she had wept and trembled, seeing her own blood; but presently, with such might and courage as was marvel, she had dragged out the bolt with her own hands. Then they had laid on the wound cotton steeped with olive oil, for she would not abide that they should steep the bolt with weapon salve and charm the hurt with a song, as the soldiers desired. Then she had confessed herself to Pasquerel, and so had lain down among the grass and the flowers. But it was Pasquerel's desire to let ferry her across secretly to Orleans. This was an ill hearing for me, yet it was put about in the army that the Maid had but taken a slight scratch, and again would lead us on, a thing which I well deemed to be impossible. So the day waxed late, and few onslaughts were made, and these with no great heart, the English standing {{on the walls and}} openly mocking us.|$|E
50|$|About 1550, the <b>breast-piece</b> of the cuirass was {{characterized}} by a vertical central ridge, called the tapul, having near its center a projecting point. Somewhat later, the tapul was moved lower on the breast. Eventually, {{the profile of the}} plate began to resemble a pea pod and, as such, was referred to as the peascod cuirass.|$|E
50|$|The Mishnah, Kelim xxvi. 5, enumerates the {{following}} articles made of leather: a covering for the mule or ass; aprons worn by muleteers and by surgeons {{to protect their}} clothes; a cradle-cover; a child's <b>breast-piece</b> {{to protect it from}} the scratching of a cat; aprons by which wool-carders and flax-spinners protected themselves from the waste of the wool or the tow of the flax; the pad placed by the porter under his load; and skins used for various purposes by individuals not engaged in any business or trade ("'orot ba'al ha-bayit"). In mishnah 8 of the same chapter, tanners' skins are spoken of; but certainly untanned skins are meant, similar to those referred to in Shab. 49a as having been spread by the tanner for people to sit upon.|$|E

The bones were usually {{on the back of the}} shaman's jacket or used on the <b>breast-piece.</b> Another important aspect used to distinguish shamans in rock art depictions is that they are wearing fringed fabric. There are differences in the lengths of the fringe and where on the shaman the fringe is located. In the rock art, the fringe was usually long single strands attached to different parts of the shaman's body. The symbolism of the fringe can be interpreted in several ways. One example is, [...] "The fringe on a shaman's coat is an important element, which marks his or her ornithomorphic nature (i.e. the ability to transform into a bird or to gain its abilities such as the capacity for flight) [...] " [...] (Devlet 44). The concept of fringe being correlated with flying was mainly used in rock art in the Altai, Tuva, and Mongolian regions.|$|E
