5|$|During the trial, {{it emerged}} that Dyer had worn gloves to avoid leaving {{fingerprints}} on {{the letters and}} used water to stick the stamps rather than licking them, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had made errors, such as leaving a copy of an extortion demand on a newsagent's photocopier, however, there is speculation that this was done so his letter would reach Tesco by a person other than himself. Although Dyer initially demanded only £200,000, Tesco would have lost an estimated £5million had they complied with Dyer's demand to place cards in every copy of the Bournemouth Echo.|$|E

5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus.

He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E

5|$|It is {{revealed}} {{that this man}} is the actual, corporeal Prismo, and the version Finn and Jake are familiar with is merely a dream.

Suddenly, an interdimensional being arrives and begins taking the Lich to the Citadel, to which Finn and Jake give chase.|$|E
