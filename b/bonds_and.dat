5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{has led to}} {{a better}} understanding of chemical <b>bonds</b> <b>and</b> non-covalent interactions. The initial studies revealed the typical radii of atoms, and confirmed many theoretical models of chemical bonding, such as the tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the diamond structure, the octahedral bonding of metals observed in ammonium hexachloroplatinate (IV), and the resonance observed in the planar carbonate group and in aromatic molecules. Kathleen Lonsdale's 1928 structure of hexamethylbenzene established the hexagonal symmetry of benzene and showed a clear difference in bond length between the aliphatic C–C <b>bonds</b> <b>and</b> aromatic C–C bonds; this finding led to the idea of resonance between chemical bonds, which had profound consequences for the development of chemistry. Her conclusions were anticipated by William Henry Bragg, who published models of naphthalene and anthracene in 1921 based on other molecules, an early form of molecular replacement.|$|E

5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into the}} realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak <b>bonds</b> <b>and</b> hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} has assessed {{gender differences in}} delinquency due to differential social controls, yet important questions remain regarding gender <b>and</b> social <b>bonding.</b> As much of this work was premised on Hirschi’s measurement of the social bond, we examine whether gender moderates {{two parts of the}} social bond: the measurement of the social <b>bond</b> <b>and</b> structural differences between the social <b>bond</b> <b>and</b> delinquency. Using multiple-group structural equation modeling, we find that neither the measures of the social bond nor their relationships with property crime are gender-specific. The structural relationship between the elements of the social <b>bond</b> <b>and</b> violent delinquency differs slightly for boys and girls. We discuss implications of this research for social control theory, measuring the social <b>bond</b> <b>and</b> for gender-specific theories of social <b>bonding</b> <b>and</b> control...|$|R
50|$|Usually, {{a single}} bond is a sigma bond. An {{exception}} is the bond in diboron, which is a pi bond. In contrast, the double bond consists of one sigma <b>bond</b> <b>and</b> one pi <b>bond,</b> <b>and</b> a triple <b>bond</b> consists of one sigma <b>bond</b> <b>and</b> two pi <b>bonds</b> (Moore, Stanitski, <b>and</b> Jurs 396). The number of component bonds is what determines the strength disparity. It {{stands to reason that}} the single bond is the weakest of the three because it consists of only a sigma <b>bond,</b> <b>and</b> the double <b>bond</b> or triple bond consist not only of this type of component bond but also at least one additional bond.|$|R

5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon <b>bonds</b> <b>and</b> thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E

5|$|Thallium is {{the first}} element in group 13 where the {{reduction}} of the +3 oxidation state to the +1 oxidation state is spontaneous under standard conditions. Since bond energies decrease down the group, by thallium, the energy released in forming two additional <b>bonds</b> <b>and</b> attaining the +3 state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the 6s-electrons. Accordingly, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide are more acidic, showing that thallium conforms to the general rule of elements being more electropositive in their lower oxidation states.|$|E
