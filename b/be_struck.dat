5|$|Following an {{investigation}} into Speyer's wartime conduct held in camera by the Home Office's Certificates of Naturalisation (Revocation) Committee, Speyer's naturalisation was revoked by an order dated 1 December 1921. On 13 December 1921 an order was issued by King George V for Speyer to <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> off {{the list of the}} Privy Council. The next person to <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> off the list was Elliot Morley in 2011, though others resigned in the intervening period.|$|E

5000|$|The {{issue was}} {{generally}} considered a success, and beginning in 1936, the silver dollar (in [...]800 fine silver) <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> more-or-less annually {{as a regular}} issue for general circulation, with the same reverse design as in 1935. Although commemorative dollars <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> for circulation for the visit of King George VI in 1939, no regular issue dollars <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> that year, or, as it turned out, {{until the end of}} World War II in 1945. Thereafter, Voyageur Dollars <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> each year through 1966, except in years (e.g. 1935, 1939, and 1958) when a commemorative dollar <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> for circulation.

5|$|In November 2003, the Mint {{announced}} {{the first two}} reverse designs, to <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> with Schlag's obverse in 2004. The first, designed by United States Mint sculptor-engraver Norman E. Nemeth, depicts an adaptation of the Indian Peace Medals struck for Jefferson. The second, by Mint sculptor-engraver Alfred Maletsky, depicts a keelboat like that used by the Expedition.|$|E

5|$|Some {{people believe}} that, for various reasons, large cities cannot <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> by tornadoes. More than 100tornadoes have been {{reported}} to strike downtown areas of large cities.

50|$|In 1847 and 1848, coins {{were issued}} in {{denominations}} of 1 att, 1 and 2 pe, 1 fuang, ¼, 1 and 4 tical.

5|$|The act {{provided}} for {{a maximum of}} 40,000 medals, to <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> at the Philadelphia Mint, from design models prepared by the Norse-American Centennial Commission. Medals would {{be turned over to}} a designated agent of the commission on payment of the cost of producing them. They were to be made subject to the provisions of section 52 of the Coinage Act of 1873. That section permitted medals of a national character to <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> at the Philadelphia Mint, but forbade Mint personnel from making dies for private medals, and was enacted after Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Franklin Peale had for some years run a private medals business on Mint premises, prior to his firing in 1854.|$|E
5|$|The ideal age {{to start}} {{training}} dromedaries for riding is three years, {{although they may}} be stubborn and unruly. At first the camel's head is controlled, and it is later trained to respond to sitting and standing commands, and to allow mounting. At this stage a camel will often try to escape when a trainer tries to mount it. The next stage involves training it to respond to reins. The animal must be given loads gradually and not forced to carry heavy loads {{before the age of}} six. Riding camels should not <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> on their necks, rather they should <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> behind the right leg of the rider. Leese described two types of saddles generally used in camel riding; the Arabian markloofa used by single riders and the Indian pakra used when two riders mount the same camel.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1780s, a {{large number}} of {{prominent}} Americans called {{for the establishment of a}} central mint to supply the United States with official coinage; all such proposals failed due in large part to lack of funds and opposition from individuals and groups who preferred that coins <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> by the individual states. Since there were no federal coins issued, the needs of the states were fulfilled by a variety of domestic and foreign coins and tokens, including Spanish eight-real coins (popularly known as Spanish dollars or pieces of eight).|$|E
50|$|In 1318 AH (1900), {{a copper}} larin (or laari) <b>was</b> <b>struck.</b> In 1319 AH (1901), a copper Larin <b>was</b> also <b>struck.</b> In 1320 AH (1902), a copper Larin & a 4 laari <b>was</b> <b>struck.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, 3,055 proof cents <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> at the San Francisco Mint {{without the}} [...] "S" [...] mint mark, making them {{appear as if}} they had <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> at the Philadelphia Mint.

5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan for decimalisation of the currency (120 years after this denomination was first introduced in the initial plan to introduce a decimal currency), from 1968 the ten pence coin was introduced of the same size, weight and metal composition as the florin. Thus, the florin ceased to <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> for circulation after the 1967-dated pieces. The new and the old circulated side by side as florins prior to Decimal Day (15 February 1971) and as ten pence pieces after.|$|E
5|$|In proposing {{his plan}} for a mint and a coinage system, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton in 1791 {{proposed}} that the one-dollar denomination <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> both as a gold coin, and as one of silver, representative of the two metals which he proposed be made legal tender. Congress followed Hamilton's recommendation only in part, authorizing a silver dollar, but no coin of that denomination in gold.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Head gold pieces or Pratt-Bigelow {{gold coins}} were two {{separate}} coin series, identical in design, {{struck by the}} United States Mint: a two-and-a-half dollar piece, or quarter eagle, and a five-dollar coin, or half eagle. The quarter eagle was struck from 1908 to 1915 and from 1925–1929. The half eagle was struck from 1908 to 1916, and in 1929. The pieces remain the only US circulating coins with recessed designs. These coins were the last of their denominations to <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> for circulation, ending a series which had begun in the 1790s.|$|E

5|$|The old bronze penny was {{slated for}} {{elimination}} as decimal currency was planned in the 1960s. It continued to <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> after 1967, still bearing that date. The 97 percent copper, 0.5 percent tin, 2.5 percent zinc alloy was used {{again for the}} 1960s pennies. Finally, there was an issue of proof quality coins dated 1970 for collectors, to bid farewell to a denomination which had served the country well for 1200 years. The longstanding depiction of Britannia on the penny was translated by sculptor Christopher Ironside to the post-decimal fifty-pence coin.|$|E
5|$|A statewide {{review by}} {{emergency}} management officials recorded 249 fatalities in Alabama, 23 {{of which were}} not tornado-related. Damage and power outages in the Huntsville area were so widespread {{that at one point}} over 650,000 people were out of power in the Tennessee Valley Authority system. The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged main power lines coming from Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant further to the northeast. These towers were the main supply of electrical power to much of North Alabama and some were without power for two weeks. The tornado just missed the Limestone Correctional Facility, which {{less than a year later}} would <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> by another tornado.|$|E
5|$|According to Ehrman, Jesus {{taught that}} a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not {{anything}} in this life. He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, sometimes in opposition to other traditions. Jesus put love {{at the center of}} the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E

50|$|In 1967, coins were {{introduced}} in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 cents. The 1 and 5 cents <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> in nickel brass, with the other denominations struck in cupro-nickel. In 1996, high inflation caused the introduction of 1, 5 and 10 dollars coins.

5|$|After {{completing}} Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci {{suggested to}} Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign, a new gold coin equal to one pound {{that was to}} <b>be</b> <b>struck,</b> would be Saint George. Until the early 20th century, gold coins were struck for circulation, rather than as bullion pieces. Kevin Clancy, in his volume {{on the history of}} the sovereign coin, doubted whether the Spencer commission was truly the inspiration for the George and Dragon design which that coin has long featured, and that the idea might not even have come from Pistrucci. Clancy argued that such motifs were common at the time and that the story originated with Pistrucci, whom he deemed an unreliable witness on his own past.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns still on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts used to handle the bombs and torpedoes and the limited number of ordnance elevators. Thus, the torpedoes could not <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took {{about an hour and a}} half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck and warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message that American carriers had been spotted. At 07:30 Kaga recovered three of her CAP.|$|E
