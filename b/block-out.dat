40|$|Abstract Satisfying {{the large}} car impact {{condition}} of the high level SB 5 -B for "SMART Highway " longitudinal barriers, the possibility of increase of the small car impact velocity from 120 km/h to 130 km/h was investigated. Through computer simulation using input parameters calibrated to full-scale crash test results, various longitudinal semi-rigid barrier models were improved such that for the small car impact speed of 120 km/h the change of longitudinal and transverse velocities of the impact vehicle can satisfy the limit. The barrier model determined through this process satisfied the performance assessment criteria for SB 5 -B impact conditions. Varying the wing angle of slip <b>block-outs</b> of the passed barrier model, the possibility of increase of the small car impact velocity was investigated by FEA and a full-scale crash test was conducted. It {{has been shown that}} the possibility to increase the small car impact speed to 130 km/h is high if the test facility condition fo...|$|R

40|$|Steel trusses are {{the most}} popular system for {{supporting}} long span roofs in commercial buildings, such as warehouses and aircraft hangars. There are several advantages of steel trusses, such as lightweight, ease of handling and erection, and geometric flexibility. However, they have some drawbacks, such as high material and maintenance cost, and low fire resistance. In this paper, a precast concrete truss is proposed as an alternative to steel trusses for spans up to 160 ft. without intermediate supports. The proposed design is easy to produce and has lower construction and maintenance costs than steel trusses. The proposed design is an evolution of the system that was developed by e. Construct USA, LLC and was used in the construction of a cement storage facility at United Arab of Emirates. The proposed truss design consists of two segments that are formed using standard bridge girder forms (PCI and AASHTO girders) with <b>block-outs</b> in the web that result in having diagonals and vertical sections. The two segments are then connected using a wet joint and post-tensioned longitudinally. The proposed design optimizes the truss-girder member locations, cross-sections, and material use. A Finite Element Analysis for the truss-girder system is conducted to investigate stresses at truss connections and the wet joint. A 30 -foot long truss specimen is constructed at the structural laboratory of UNL to investigate the constructability of the truss and the structural capacity of the diagonals, verticals, and connections. Testing results indicate the production and structural efficiency of the developed system. Adviser: George Morcous and Maher K. Tadro...|$|R

40|$|This project {{conveys the}} {{processes}} and research efforts employed {{in order to}} eliminate the frequent cyclical repair of handrail anchorages affixed to coastal concrete balconies through a building code modification. This report also recognizes the benefits experienced through industry and professional partnerships, which helped expedite the code modification process by avoiding the bureaucratic and institutional barriers that have allowed the problem to continue. Typical coastal balcony corrosion issues stem from design and construction practices that increase the exposure of dissimilar metals to an environment containing abnormally high levels of moisture and chloride. Eliminating or reducing the ability for the galvanic reaction that occurs in this environment will significantly {{reduce the likelihood of}} aggressive and rapid corrosion within the balcony. x To do this, care should be taken to use the materials and methods described in this report to prevent chlorides from penetrating into grout at the handrail posts and to prevent the effect chlorides have on embedded metals, should intrusion occur. The code modification suggests two less-conductive handrail anchoring methods. Both methods forbid the use of the core-drilling method and cementitious grout. Instead, the builder is instructed to either: 1. Surface mount the handrail posts to the concrete slab 2. Pre-form handrail post-holes before concrete is placed using the ???<b>block-out???</b> method and use an epoxy-based grout or equivalent material to anchor the handrails to the balcony slab. Both of these alternative methods reduce the conductive environment that perpetuates this corrosive cycle. CSU, Chic...|$|E
40|$|The DSN (Deep Space Network) Scheduling Engine targets all space {{missions}} that use DSN services. It allows clients to issue scheduling, conflict identification, conflict resolution, and status requests in XML over a Java Message Service interface. The scheduling requests may include new requirements that represent {{a set of}} tracks to be scheduled under some constraints. This program uses a heuristic local search to schedule a variety of schedule requirements, and is being infused into the Service Scheduling Assembly, a mixed-initiative scheduling application. The engine resolves conflicting schedules of resource allocation according {{to a range of}} existing and possible requirement specifications, including optional antennas; start of track and track duration ranges; periodic tracks; locks on track start, duration, and allocated antenna; MSPA (multiple spacecraft per aperture); arraying/VLBI (very long baseline interferometry) /delta DOR (differential one-way ranging); continuous tracks; segmented tracks; gap-to-track ratio; and override or <b>block-out</b> of requirements. The scheduling models now include conflict identification for SOA(start of activity), BOT (beginning of track), RFI (radio frequency interference), and equipment constraints. This software will search through all possible allocations while providing a best-effort solution at any time. The engine reschedules to accommodate individual emergency tracks in 0. 2 second, and emergency antenna downtime in 0. 2 second. The software handles doubling of one mission's track requests over one week (to 42 total) in 2. 7 seconds. Further tests will be performed in the context of actual schedules...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground/purposeThe {{consequence}} of premature loss of primary teeth {{resulting in the}} need for space maintainers has been controversial for many years. There is no longitudinal long-term report in literature regarding the premature loss of a primary maxillary first molar. The {{aim of this study}} was to continue observing the long-term space changes of 19 cases following premature loss of a primary maxillary first molar during the transition from primary to permanent dentition. Materials and methodsTen of the 19 original participants were excluded because of extensive decay or loss to follow-up. Nine children (mean age at time of tooth extraction, 6. 0  ±  0. 42  years) with unilateral premature loss of a primary maxillary first molar were examined. Maxillary dental study casts were obtained 2  days or 3  days after tooth removal and, on average, 81  months later. The contralateral intact primary molars in each participant served as controls. The arch width, arch length, intercanine width, intercanine length, and arch perimeter of each study cast from the initial and follow-up examinations were measured and compared using paired t-tests. ResultsEight of nine cases (88. 9 %) did not show crowded permanent successors or canine <b>block-out</b> at the extraction site. Interestingly, the permanent dentition was more crowded at the control site (2 / 9) than at the extraction site (1 / 9). The arch width, arch length, intercanine width, and intercanine length significantly increased at 81  months (P <  0. 05), whereas the arch perimeter increases approached significance (P =  0. 071). ConclusionThe anterior and posterior arch dimensions significantly increased 81  months after premature loss of a primary maxillary first molar, which suggested that space maintainers were not needed in these cases...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare surface loss values after erosion-abrasion cycles {{obtained}} with modified surface microhardness measurement (mSMH), focus variation 3 D microscopy (FVM) and contact stylus profilometry (CSP). We cut human molars into buccal and lingual halves, embedded them in resin and ground 200 μm of enamel away. The resulting surfaces were polished. To maintain a reference area, we applied <b>Block-Out</b> resin to partly cover the enamel surface. The samples were incubated in artificial saliva (37 °C; 1 h), then rinsed in deionized water (10 s) and dried with oil-free air (5 s). We immersed the specimens individually in 30 mL citric acid (1 %, pH 3. 6) for 2 min (25 °C, 70 rpm dynamic conditions) before brushing them (50 strokes, 200 g) in an automatic brushing machine with toothpaste-slurry. We calculated the surface loss as per mSMH, by re-measuring the length of the same six indentations made before the abrasive challenge. The experiment consisted of five experimental groups that received between 2 and 10 erosion-abrasion cycles. Each group contained 15 specimens and samples in groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 underwent a total of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 cycles, respectively. The resin was removed from the reference area in one piece under 10 × magnification and the FVM and CSP were performed. Agreement between the methods was calculated with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and depicted in Bland-Altman plots. All methods presented a linear pattern of surface loss measurements throughout the experiment, leading overall to a strong, statistically significant correlation between the methods (ICC = 0. 85; p< 0. 001). So, despite the different surface loss values, all methods presented consistent results for surface loss measurement...|$|E
