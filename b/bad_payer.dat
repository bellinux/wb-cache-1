50|$|In Europe, {{parking tickets}} are also heavily used. In Sweden, parking {{violations}} on street are considered traffic crimes with a fine. If the fine is not objected or paid within a specified time, the Swedish Enforcement Administration will claim money from bank accounts or other assets, relatively fast. The owner will be noted as a <b>bad</b> <b>payer,</b> {{and will not}} get a loan or a new rental apartment etc. for three years. A parking violation on a parking place (not on the street) is considered a break of contract which results in a penalty fee with different rules. According to statistics from Stockholm the cars with {{the highest number of}} parking violations (weighted for number of cars) are Jeep, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Lexus. Mercedes owners were the worst for parking in handicap spaces. Professor Gunnar Aronsson at the department for psychology at Stockholm university believes {{this is due to the}} owners being well-off and thinking that their time is more important. According to Jan Prestberg at the traffic office in Stockholm the fines are low enough to be ignored by richer people. It is often hard to find parking spots in big cities. After wheel-locks were introduced in London, the prices for rented parking spots went up considerably.|$|E
40|$|Credit scoring {{modelling}} comprises one of {{the leading}} formal tools for supporting the granting of credit. Its core objective consists of the generation of a score by means of which potential clients can be listed in the order of the probability of default. A critical factor is whether a credit scoring model is accurate enough in order to provide correct classification of the client as a good or <b>bad</b> <b>payer.</b> In this context the concept of bootstraping aggregating (bagging) arises. The basic idea is to generate multiple classifiers by obtaining the predicted values from the fitted models to several replicated datasets and then combining them into a single predictive classification in order to improve the classification accuracy. In this paper we propose a new bagging-type variant procedure, which we call poly-bagging, consisting of combining predictors over a succession of resamplings. The study is derived by credit scoring modelling. The proposed poly-bagging procedure was applied to some different artificial datasets and to a real granting of credit dataset up to three successions of resamplings. We observed better classification accuracy for the two-bagged and the three-bagged models for all considered setups. These results lead to a strong indication that the poly-bagging approach may promote improvement on the modelling performance measures, while keeping a flexible and straightforward bagging-type structure easy to implement.

40|$|Insurance {{fraud is}} {{a major source of}} {{inefficiency}} in insurance markets. A self-justification of fraudulent behavior is that insurers are <b>bad</b> <b>payers</b> who start nitpicking if an opportunity arises, even in circum- stances where the good-faith of policyholders is not in dispute. We relate this nitpicking activity to the inability of insurers to commit to their auditing strategy. Reducing the indemnity payments acts as an incentive device for the insurer since auditing is profitable even if the claim is not fraudulent. We show that optimal indemnity cuts are bounded above and that nitpicking remains optimal even if it induces adverse effects on policyholders' moral standards...|$|R

The non-financial factors consisted of nine factors and financial factors consisted of four factors. The non-financial factors include too rapid expansion of the franchise business, greed of franchisee, franchisee attitude, poor service, poor management of the franchise business, conflict with franchisor, legal imperfection, location and external factor. Meanwhile, financial factors looked at under capitalization of the franchisee, high overhead expenses, cash flow mismanagement and <b>bad</b> <b>payers</b> franchisee. For this individual assignment, this paper tried {{to determine whether the}} factors discussed in the literature could contributes to the franchisee failures in Malaysia. The findings may be beneficial to franchisor in selection process of franchisee and provide greater understanding between franchisor and franchisee in order to improve the performance of the franchise business...|$|R

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{decisions}} {{financial institutions}} have to make {{as part of their}} daily operations is {{to decide whether or not}} to grant a loan to an applicant. With the emergence of large-scale data-storing facilities, huge amounts of data have been stored regarding the repayment behavior of past applicants. It is the aim of credit scoring to analyze this data and build models that distinguish good from <b>bad</b> <b>payers</b> using characteristics such as amount on savings account, marital status, purpose of loan, etc. Many classification techniques have been suggested to build credit-scoring models. Especially neural networks have in recent years received a lot of attention. However, while they are generally able to achieve a high predictive accuracy rate, the reasoning behind how they reach their decisions is not readily available, which hinders their acceptance by practitioners. Therefore, in [1], we have proposed a two-step process to open the neural network black box which involves: (1) extracting rules from the network; (2) visualizing this rule set using an intuitive graphical representation, such as decision tables or trees...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Traditionally, {{customer}} {{credit scoring}} aimed at distinguishing good <b>payers</b> from <b>bad</b> <b>payers</b> {{at the time}} of the loan application. However, the timing when customers become bad is also very interesting to investigate since it can provide the bank with the ability to compute the profitability over a customer’s lifetime and perform profit scoring. The problem statement of analysing when customers default is commonly referred to as survival analysis. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss and contrast statistical and neural network approaches for survival analysis in a creditscoring context. When compared to the traditional statistical proportional hazards model, neural networks may offer an interesting alternative because of their universal approximation property and the fact that no baseline hazard assumption is needed. Several neural network survival analysis models are discussed and evaluated according to their way of dealing with censored observations, time-varying inputs, the monotonicity of the generated survival curves and their scalability. In the experimental part of this paper, we contrast the performance of a neural network survival analysis model with that of the well-known proportional hazards model for predicting both loan default and early repayment using data from a U.

40|$|This paper aims to {{discover}} whether the predictive accuracy {{of a new}} applicant scoring model for a credit card can be improved by estimating separate scoring models for applicants who are predicted to have high or low usage of the card. Two models are estimated. First we estimate a model to explain the desired usage of a card, and second we estimate separately two further scoring models, one for those applicants whose usage is predicted to be high, and one for those for whom it is predicted to be low. The desired usage model is a two-stage Heckman model {{to take into account}} the fact that the observed usage of accepted applicants is constrained by their credit limit. Thus a model of the determinants of the credit limit, and one of usage, are both estimated using Heckman's ML estimator. We find a large number of variables to be correlated with desired usage. We also find that the two stage scoring methodology gives only very marginal improvements over a single stage scoring model, that we are able to predict a greater percentage of <b>bad</b> <b>payers</b> for low users than for high users and a greater percentage of good payers for high users than for low users...|$|R

Based on the current framework of sophisticated feature selection methods, we iden-tify features that contain the most relevant information to distinguish good loan <b>payers</b> from <b>bad</b> loan <b>payers.</b> The feature selection methods are validated on several real world datasets with different types of classifiers. We show the advantages following from using the sub-space approach to classification. We discuss many practical issues related to the applicability of feature selection methods. We show and discuss some difficulties that use to be insufficiently emphasised in standard feature selection literature...|$|R

Brakstad was fired in July, and Dokken was again hired as manager, on condition that he was also allowed to manage the team the following season. Dokken led the team to an eighth place in the league, and a victory over Linfield and loss for Red Star Belgrade in the European Cup. The 1987 season saw the odd rule that all league ties were to be determined with a penalty shootout, with a bonus point going to the winners. Along with moving games to Saturday, {{the goal was to}} make games more attractive. Instead, attendance hit rock bottom, with only 1,000 spectators watching the Lillestrøm game. Rosenborg had 11 penalty shootouts in 22 games, and lost 7 of them. The team finished fourth in the league.|$|R
