40|$|Elevated intze {{tanks are}} used to store large {{quantity}} of water. They {{are used to}} supply water under gravity. Intze tanks are known as modified version of cylindrical tanks. They may <b>be</b> <b>shaft</b> supported or trestle supported. Earlier IS: 1893 - 1984 considered elevated tanks as single degree of freedom systems. But IS: 1893 - 2002 (Part 2), suggests two mass model having impulsive and convective modes of vibration for elevated tanks. This paper presents a parametric study to analyze the effect of variation of height/diameter (h/d) ratio of tank container and tank capacities on parameters like time period, base shear, base moment and hydrodynamic pressure for both the modes. It is hoped, that this studywill be helpful to understand the seismic behaviour of intze tank supported on shaft...|$|E

50|$|The mine's first <b>shaft</b> <b>was</b> {{known as}} No. 4 as three other <b>shafts</b> had already <b>been</b> dug {{in the same}} area {{belonging}} to other mines located closer to Whitehaven Harbour. <b>Shaft</b> No. 4 <b>was</b> 387 m deep and 5.8 m in diameter. No. 5 <b>shaft</b> <b>was</b> constructed at the same time, but the winding gear and steam engine were not installed until 1920-1921 and its <b>shaft</b> <b>was</b> slightly wider at 6.77 m in diameter. The engines powering both <b>shafts</b> <b>were</b> built by Bever Dorling of Bradford. Initially, No. 4 <b>shaft</b> <b>was</b> used to transport everything {{in and out of the}} mine, but when No. 5 <b>shaft</b> <b>was</b> fitted out, all coal came via that shaft with No. 4 being used for man-riding only. The mine extended out across the Saltom Bay area of the Irish Sea for 4 mi.|$|R
40|$|The start gear <b>shaft</b> <b>is</b> the {{key part}} of {{automobile}} starter, it is involute small module internal gear with addendum modification. It <b>is</b> step <b>shaft</b> with H/D> 6 in the outline. Because of the concentric degree demand of the internal gear and the outline step <b>shaft</b> <b>is</b> higher, length of below <b>shaft</b> <b>is</b> large and diameter is small, So plastic forming of the <b>shaft</b> <b>is</b> very difficult. Meeting the needs of markets and improving comprehensive function of automobiles, the high efficient precision forming technology method of single-step chipless-forming for internal gear tooth surface and external step <b>shaft</b> <b>is</b> put forward based on analysis, study and repeated test. In the same time, a set of high accuracy die with simple novel structure and long service life is designed and manufactured. The advantages of the method have been verified that utilization ratio of material and production efficiency is high. For this reason, the method is profitable reference for producing {{the same type of}} complex shape gear shaft...|$|R

40|$|International audiencen this work, the {{non-linear}} dynamic {{behavior of}} a flexible <b>shaft</b> <b>is</b> presented. The <b>shaft</b> <b>is</b> mounted in two journal bearings and axial load {{is supported by a}} hydrodynamic thrust bearing, at one end. The coupling between the axial thrust bearing behavior and the bending vibrations of the <b>shaft</b> <b>is</b> especially studied. The <b>shaft</b> <b>is</b> modeled by a typical beam finite element method and includes gyroscopic effects. The dynamic behavior of the journal bearings and the thrust bearing are considered to be non-linear. The dynamic behavior is analyzed with a transient time integration procedure. The thrust bearing provides additional stiffness and additional damping on the flexible shaft. A defect on the thrust bearing rotor excites a critical speed...|$|R

5000|$|Quite commonly, {{helical gears}} are {{used with the}} helix angle of one having the {{negative}} of the helix angle of the other; such a pair might also {{be referred to as}} having a right-handed helix and a left-handed helix of equal angles. The two equal but opposite angles add to zero: the angle between <b>shafts</b> <b>is</b> zero—that <b>is,</b> the <b>shafts</b> <b>are</b> parallel. Where the sum or the difference (as described in the equations above) is not zero, the <b>shafts</b> <b>are</b> crossed. For <b>shafts</b> crossed at right angles, the helix angles are of the same hand because they must add to 90 degrees. (This is the case with the gears in the illustration above: they mesh correctly in the crossed configuration: for the parallel configuration, one of the helix angles should be reversed. The gears illustrated cannot mesh with the shafts parallel.) ...|$|R
