5|$|The skull {{is small}} and delicate. The front part, the rostrum, is narrow and {{relatively}} long. The nasal bones are rounded at the front, but blunt at the back. The zygomatic plate—a bony plate {{at the side of}} the skull—is narrow and extends <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> margin of the first upper molar (M1). The jugal bones constitute much of the thin zygomatic arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region, between the eyes, is narrow and hourglass-shaped. There are no crests or ridges on the interorbital region or on the braincase. The incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend back to a point between the front roots of the M1s. The bony palate itself is broad and lacks many indentations and protuberances present in other species. Its posterior margin is at the level of the upper third molars (M3s). There is no alisphenoid strut, so that the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two openings on the underside of the skull, are fused. There are 13 thoracic (chest), 7 lumbar (abdomen), 4 sacral (hip), and 38 caudal (tail) vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|During {{the worst}} European winter in 40 years, the 48th Battalion {{continued}} {{to take its}} turn at the front line, and Leane was mentioned in despatches for the fourth time. In March 1917 his battalion followed up the Germans as they withdrew towards the multi-layered Hindenburg Line of fortifications. In early April 1917, the 12th Brigade was committed to an attack aimed at capturing Bullecourt, with the 48th Battalion given the task of capturing the secondary objective, following behind the 46th Battalion. During the preparations, due to a misunderstanding, Leane was ordered by his brigade commander to send 200 troops into the village of Bullecourt, which Leane believed to be well defended. Characteristically, Leane insisted that if the order must be carried out, it would involve the destruction {{of one of his}} companies, and he would have to choose that commanded by his nephew Allan. The timely arrival of a divisional staff officer clarified the situation, and the order was cancelled. On the morning of 10 April, the battalion was formed up for the attack when the promised tank support failed to arrive on time, and the assault was postponed. During the withdrawal <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line, Leane's brother, Major Benjamin Leanenow the second-in-command of the unitwas killed by shell fire, and the battalion suffered another 20 casualties. Leane found Ben's body among the dead, and carried him to a spot where he dug a grave before erecting a cross above it.|$|E

25|$|Turbin {{was drafted}} into the Red Army in December 1941. He was sent into combat in January 1942 and was wounded. After recovering, {{he was sent to}} the Ulyanovsk Military Infantry School.

On the lumbar spine, unilateral contraction bends the trunk laterally, while bilateral contraction raises the trunk from its supine position. In addition, attachment to the lesser trochanter, located on the postero-medial aspect of the femur, causes lateral rotation and weak adduction of the hip.|$|E

25|$|Since many {{remains of}} each species of mammoth are known from several localities, it is {{possible}} to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus through morphological studies. Mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges on their molars; the primitive species had few ridges, and the amount increased gradually as new species evolved and replaced the former ones. At the same time, the crowns of the teeth became longer, and the skulls become higher from top to bottom and shorter from the <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> over time to accommodate this.|$|E
25|$|Maharramov {{fought in}} World War II from June 1941. He {{fought with the}} 70th Rifle Division near Novgorod, leading a {{communications}} squad.

He recovered and was sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> fighting on the Northwestern Front. Maharramov was wounded and after his recovery sent to the Vladimir Infantry School, from which he graduated in 1942 with the rank of lieutenant. Maharramov was appointed leader of a cadet platoon at the Ryazan Infantry School.|$|E
25|$|The Panorama Elite III was {{the last}} in the Elite series. Improvements {{continued}} to the basic Elite design; this included rear lighting, rear emergency door and subtle changes to the front grill. The rear emergency door was brought about by changes in legislation and did improve the offside appearance of the Elite, however some early Mark IIIs were completed with front emergency doors. The rear lights abandoned the soup plates in favour of tall lozenge shaped lights and the name badges were re-located from between the side bright metal strips at the <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> just behind the front door.|$|E

25|$|The {{declaration}} of war in 1914 signaled a major break in European cultural history, and a major break in the life and career of Robert Antoine Pinchon, who was mobilised on 5 August 1914 at Bernay. Pinchon was wounded in his right leg by a German mortar discharge during the First Battle of the Marne and was repatriated {{to a hospital in}} Saint-Céré. Once recovered, he was sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines, but during fierce fighting in the village of Tahure on October 6, Pinchon was wounded, this time by shrapnel to the right arm.|$|E
25|$|Direct flight muscles {{generate}} the upward stroke by the contraction {{of the muscles}} attached {{to the base of}} the wing inside the pivotal point. Outside the pivotal point the downward stroke is generated through contraction of muscles that extend from the sternum to the wing. Indirect flight muscles are attached to the tergum and sternum. Contraction makes the tergum and base of the wing pull down. In turn this movement lever the outer or main part of the wing in strokes upward. Contraction of the second set of muscles, which run from the <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the thorax, powers the downbeat. This deforms the box and lifts the tergum.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1916, Pinchon {{was sent}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{for the second}} time. After several {{unsuccessful}} offensive assaults, the Germans were able {{to gain control of}} the French coast near Damloup. Robert Antoine Pinchon became a prisoner of war and was evacuated to Gerichshain, Germany (east of Leipzig). His father arranged for a painting of his to be shown at the 9th Salon des artistes rouennais (April–May 1917). Pinchon remained a prisoner in Germany from autumn 1916 until autumn 1918, but was able to create several pastels while in captivity. Meanwhile, works by Pinchon were shown again at the Galerie Legrip in Rouen.|$|E

25|$|In 1920, the Robbins Company {{took over}} production. They {{produced}} six distinct variants, all in sterling silver. The first 1920 version {{was similar to}} the Dieges & Clust design, but with smaller scroll lettering and the standard single knot. The second 1920 version has more distinctive feathering on {{the back side of the}} pendant. The engraving on the 1930 version is especially fine. In 1933, BSA was removed from all of the Eagle Scout insignia, including the medal. In 1955 the obverse of the eagle pendant was made flat so it could be engraved. BSA was added <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and the reverse was returned to a full feathered design in 1969.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 1917, he was {{commissioned}} as a sottotenente and reassigned to 50a Squadriglia. His determination to continue fighting despite battle damaged aircraft won him renown; on both 8 January and 19 February, he {{was granted a}} Bronze Medal for Military Valor. On 19 June 1917, he was shot down by bullets through his Farman's radiator. That same day, {{he was awarded the}} Croce di Guerra. In September 1917, he was forwarded to fighter pilot's training in Malpensa. On 4 October, he was promoted to tenente.

25|$|On 23 June 1941, Papin {{was drafted}} again. He fought on the Northwestern Front, leading {{elements}} of the 179th Separate Antiaircraft Battalion. On 19 August 1941, Papin was wounded. During evacuation, his group was attacked by German machine gunners. Despite his wound, Papin reportedly killed three German soldiers, forcing them to flee. After recovery, Papin went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> in January 1942. He was appointed acting commander of the mortar platoon of the 508th Rifle Regiment of the 85th Rifle Division of the Kalinin Front. He participated in the Rzhev-Vyazma Offensive. In the capture of Korovino village, Papin's mortars suppressed five German firing positions, allowing the attack to succeed. He was seriously injured again on 22 January 1942.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, then England-based Australian, Russell Ingall {{was chosen}} to fill the vacant {{endurance}} seat.
