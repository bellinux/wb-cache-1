5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{can also}} be performed to measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of hydrocephalus. However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because {{it can lead to}} fatal <b>brain</b> <b>herniation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{complications}} {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} SCSFLS including decreased cranial pressure, <b>brain</b> <b>herniation,</b> infection, blood pressure problems, transient paralysis, and coma. The primary and most serious complication of SCSFLS is spontaneous intracranial hypotension, where pressure in the brain is severely decreased. This complication leads to the hallmark symptom of severe orthostatic headaches.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly <b>brain</b> <b>herniation.</b> Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E
30|$|In this report, {{we present}} our patient with aneurysmal SAH who {{suffered}} <b>brain</b> stem <b>herniation</b> secondary to intraoperative lumbar drainage and review the clinical symptoms with radiologic findings.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Brain</b> stem <b>herniation</b> due to raised {{intracranial}} pressure (ICP) {{is a common}} cause of mortality in severe bacterial meningitis, but continuous measurements of ICP {{and the effects of}} ICP-reducing therapy in these patients have, to our knowledge, not been described. METHODS: During a four-year period, an ICP-monitoring device was implanted in patients admitted to our hospital with severe bacterial meningitis and suspected intracranial hypertension. ICP above 20 mmHg was treated using the Lund Concept, which includes antihypertensive therapy (beta 1 -antagonist,alpha 2 -agonist), normalization of the plasma colloid osmotic pressure and the blood volume, and antistress therapy. RESULTS: ICP above 20 mmHg was found in all 12 patients studied. It was effectively reduced in all but two patients, who died. Both patients had a low cerebral perfusion pressure (< 10 mmHg), dilated pupils at start of therapy and were beyond recovery. Radiological signs of brain swelling were present in only five patients. Seven patients recovered fully, while mild audiological impairment was observed in two and minor neurological sequelae in one patient. Eight patients showed signs suggesting imminent <b>brain</b> stem <b>herniation</b> before start of ICP-reducing treatment, seven of whom had been subjected to diagnostic lumbar dural puncture shortly before development of the brain stem symptoms. These symptoms gradually regressed after initiation of therapy, and in one patient reversal of <b>brain</b> stem <b>herniation</b> was documented by MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Severe bacterial meningitis can be associated with increased ICP, which can be reduced using the Lund Concept. The high survival rate, the low frequency of sequelae and the reversal of signs of imminent <b>brain</b> stem <b>herniation</b> in these high-risk patients indicated beneficial effects of the intervention. The study confirms earlier observations that lumbar dural puncture is potentially hazardous in patients with intracranial hypertension, because it may trigger <b>brain</b> stem <b>herniation.</b> A normal CT brain scan does not rule out intracranial hypertension...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{intracranial}} hypotension with <b>brain</b> stem <b>herniation</b> and <b>brain</b> sag causes an altered mental status {{and signs of}} herniation after intraoperative lumbar drainage, especially in aneurysmal SAH patients (Connolly et al. 1997; Samadani et al. 2003). This may lead to permanent neurologic deficit {{or it may be}} fatal (Alaraj et al. 2011; Komotar et al. 2005; Samadani et al. 2003).|$|R
5|$|Neck {{stiffness}} usually presents {{six hours}} after initial onset of SAH. Isolated dilation of a pupil {{and loss of}} the pupillary light reflex may reflect <b>brain</b> <b>herniation</b> {{as a result of}} rising intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull). Intraocular hemorrhage (bleeding into the eyeball) may occur in response to the raised pressure: subhyaloid hemorrhage (bleeding under the hyaloid membrane, which envelops the vitreous body of the eye) and vitreous hemorrhage may be visible on fundoscopy. This is known as Terson syndrome (occurring in 3–13 percent of cases) and is more common in more severe SAH.|$|E

25|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>herniation,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as brain hernia, is a potentially deadly side effect of very high intracranial pressure that occurs when a part of the brain is squeezed across structures within the skull.|$|E
30|$|A lumbar {{drainage}} catheter is frequently placed intra-operatively to decrease fluid {{pressure on the}} brain in aneurysmal subarachnoid cases. In rare cases, this catheter placement can lead to intracranial hypotension, resulting in <b>brain</b> stem <b>herniation</b> termed “brain sag” and {{it can lead to}} neurological injury and may prove to be fatal. We present our patient with brain sag secondary to intraoperative lumbar drainage.|$|R
5000|$|Carrillo also {{produced}} {{a body of}} research into <b>brain</b> <b>herniations</b> protruding into blood cysterns (cysternal herniations) and the syndromes occurring after a brain contusion; he discovered what became known as [...] "Carrillo's disease," [...] or acute papillitis; described in detail the cerebral scleroses, during whose research he performed many cerebral transplants (brain grafts) between living rabbits; and histologically reclassified the cerebral tumors and the inflammations of the innermost brain envelope (arachnoid mater) known as arachnoiditis. He also proposed a widely used, pre-DSM classification of mental illnesses. Against considerable opposition from conservative colleagues, in 1942 and at the age of 36 Carrillo became the Chair of Neurosurgery at the University of Buenos Aires School of Medicine. Among the influential Argentine physicians he trained were Germán Dickmann, Raúl Matera, D. E. Nijensohn, Raúl Carrea, Fernando Knesevich, Lorenzo Amezúa, Jorge Cohen, Jacobo and Leon Zimman, Rogelio Driollet Laspiur, Juan C. Christensen, and Alberto D. Kaplan.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the causes}} of {{anisocoria}} are life-threatening, including Horner's syndrome (which may be due to carotid dissection) and oculomotor nerve palsy (due to a <b>brain</b> aneurysm, uncal <b>herniation,</b> or head trauma).|$|R
25|$|Treatment {{involves}} {{removal of}} the etiologic mass and decompressive craniectomy. <b>Brain</b> <b>herniation</b> can cause severe disability or death. In fact, when herniation is visible on a CT scan, the prognosis for a meaningful recovery of neurological function is poor. The patient may become paralyzed {{on the same side}} as the lesion causing the pressure, or damage to parts of the brain caused by herniation may cause paralysis on the side opposite the lesion. Damage to the midbrain, which contains the reticular activating network which regulates consciousness, will result in coma. Damage to the cardio-respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata will cause respiratory arrest and (secondarily) cardiac arrest. Current investigation is underway regarding the use of neuroprotective agents during the prolonged post-traumatic period of brain hypersensitivity associated with the syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>herniation</b> {{frequently}} presents with abnormal posturing {{a characteristic}} {{positioning of the}} limbs indicative of severe brain damage. [...] These patients have a lowered level of consciousness, with Glasgow Coma Scores of three to five. One or both pupils may be dilated and fail to constrict in response to light. Vomiting can also occur due to compression of the vomiting center in the medulla oblongata.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>herniation</b> is a {{potentially}} deadly {{side effect of}} very high pressure within the skull that occurs when {{a part of the}} brain is squeezed across structures within the skull. The brain can shift across such structures as the falx cerebri, the tentorium cerebelli, and even through the foramen magnum (the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord connects with the brain). [...] Herniation can be caused by a number of factors that cause a mass effect and increase intracranial pressure (ICP): these include traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, or brain tumor.|$|E
30|$|Eleven {{patients}} (85 %) {{of group}} I had a favorable outcome, {{and only two}} patients (15 %) died due to <b>brain</b> edema and <b>herniation</b> early in the postoperative period. In group II, a favorable outcome was observed in 15 patients (54 %), while 4 patients (14 %) had severe disability, and 9 patients died (32 %). Causes of death were: sepsis (n = 3), meningitis (n = 1), combination of sepsis and meningitis (n = 2), <b>brain</b> edema and <b>herniation</b> (n = 1), acromegalic cardiomyopathy (n = 1), and pulmonary thromboembolism (n = 1). An absolute risk of having a poorer neurologic recovery (any other below GOS 5) in patients with IAH was 0.89, with a 95 % confidence interval of 0.77 to 1.0. The length of stay [LOS] in the NICU was significantly longer in patients with IAH (p = 0.02, Table 2).|$|R

Ewing sarcoma family tumor (ESFT) members commonly originate in bones and soft tissues. However, a few published articles describe ESFT arising from cranial cavities. Pathologically, ES/pPNET are composed of small round cells. Unambiguous distinction between pPNET and other small round cell tumors, in particular central PNET, is of clinical significance. Definitive diagnoses of pPNET can be obtained through CD 99 (MIC 2 gene product) membrane positivities and molecular identifications of chromosomal rearrangements between EWS and ETS family genes. Multimodal approaches comprising surgical resections, radiotherapies, and chemotherapies are required for the treatment of ESFT. Decompressive medical measures are preferentially performed when epidural masses are compressing spinal cords.

40|$|Background-Current {{regulations}} {{require that}} all cardiac allograft offers for transplantation must include an interpreted 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG). However, {{little is known}} about the expected ECG findings in potential organ donors or the clinical significance of any identified abnormalities in terms of cardiac allograft function and suitability for transplantation. Methods and Results-A single experienced reviewer interpreted the first ECG obtained after <b>brain</b> stem <b>herniation</b> in 980 potential organ donors managed by the California Transplant Donor Network from 2002 to 2007. ECG abnormalities were summarized, and associations between specific ECG findings and cardiac allograft use for transplantation were studied. ECG abnormalities were present in 51 % of all cases reviewed. The most common abnormalities included voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy, prolongation of the corrected QT interval, and repolarization changes (ST/T wave abnormalities). Fifty-seven percent of potential cardiac allografts in this cohort were accepted for transplantation. Left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG was a strong predictor of allograft nonuse. No significant associations were seen among corrected QT interval prolongation, repolarization changes, and allograft use for transplantation after adjusting for donor clinical variables and echocardiographic findings. Conclusions-We have performed the first comprehensive study of ECG findings in potential donors for cardiac transplantation. Many of the common ECG abnormalities seen in organ donors may result from the heightened state of sympathetic activation that occurs after <b>brain</b> stem <b>herniation</b> and are not associated with allograft use for transplantation. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc...|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{damaging}} aspects of brain trauma and other conditions, directly correlated with poor outcome, is an elevated intracranial pressure. [...] ICP is very likely to cause severe harm if it rises too high. [...] Very high intracranial pressures are usually fatal if prolonged, but children can tolerate higher pressures for longer periods. [...] An increase in pressure, most commonly due to head injury leading to intracranial hematoma or cerebral edema, can crush brain tissue, shift brain structures, contribute to hydrocephalus, cause <b>brain</b> <b>herniation,</b> and restrict blood supply to the brain. It is a cause of reflex bradycardia.|$|E
2500|$|In ALF, hepatic {{encephalopathy}} leads to cerebral edema, coma, <b>brain</b> <b>herniation,</b> and eventually death. [...] Detection of encephalopathy {{is central to}} the diagnosis of ALF. [...] It may vary from subtle deficit in higher brain function (e.g. mood, concentration in grade I) to deep coma (grade IV). [...] Patients presenting as acute and hyperacute liver failure are at greater risk of developing cerebral oedema and grade IV encephalopathy. The pathogenesis remains unclear, but {{is likely to be a}} consequence of several phenomena. [...] There is a buildup of toxic substances like ammonia, mercaptan, benzodiazepines, serotonin and tryptophan in the brain. [...] This affects neurotransmitter level and neuroreceptor activation. [...] Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is impaired, and is associated with anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative stress. [...] Neuronal cell astrocytes are susceptible to these changes, and they swell up, resulting in increased intracranial pressure. [...] Inflammatory mediators also play important role.|$|E
2500|$|In {{patients}} who have high ICP due to an acute injury, it is particularly important to ensure adequate airway, breathing, and oxygenation. Inadequate blood oxygen levels (hypoxia) or excessively high carbon dioxide levels (hypercapnia) cause cerebral blood vessels to dilate, increasing {{the flow of blood}} to the brain and causing the ICP to rise. [...] Inadequate oxygenation also forces brain cells to produce energy using anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactic acid and lowers pH, also dilating blood vessels and exacerbating the problem. [...] Conversely, blood vessels constrict when carbon dioxide levels are below normal, so hyperventilating a patient with a ventilator or bag valve mask can temporarily reduce ICP. Hyperventilation was formerly a part of the standard treatment of traumatic brain injuries, but the induced constriction of blood vessels limits blood flow to the brain {{at a time when the}} brain may already be ischemic—hence it is no longer widely used. [...] Furthermore, the brain adjusts to the new level of carbon dioxide after 48 to 72 hours of hyperventilation, which could cause the vessels to rapidly dilate if carbon-dioxide levels were returned to normal too quickly. [...] Hyperventilation is still used if ICP is resistant to other methods of control, or there are signs of <b>brain</b> <b>herniation,</b> because the damage herniation can cause is so severe that it may be worthwhile to constrict blood vessels even if doing so reduces blood flow. ICP can also be lowered by raising the head of the bed, improving venous drainage. A side effect of this is that it could lower pressure of blood to the head, resulting in a reduced and possibly inadequate blood supply to the brain. Venous drainage may also be impeded by external factors such as hard collars to immobilize the neck in trauma patients, and this may also increase the ICP. [...] Sandbags may be used to further limit neck movement.|$|E
30|$|Symptoms usually develop when serum sodium {{concentration}} {{drops below}} 125  mmol/L. The most frequent symptoms are headache, nausea, vomiting and weakness. If further fluid intravasation occurs, {{reduction of the}} blood osmolality creates an osmotic gradient that moves water into the interstitial and intracellular space, leading to brain oedema and increased intracranial pressure. The resultant cerebral oedema may present with signs of cerebral irritation such as agitation, apprehension, confusion, weakness, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, blindness and headache. If significant, {{it can lead to}} <b>brain</b> stem <b>herniation,</b> coma and death [22]. A further fall of sodium below 120  mmol/L may lead to confusion, lethargy, seizures, coma, arrhythmias, bradycardia and respiratory arrest.|$|R
50|$|Imaging {{basically}} encompasses {{computed tomography}} (CAT or CT) {{scan of the}} brain, or MRI for example, and is performed to identify specific causes of the coma, such as hemorrhage in the <b>brain</b> or <b>herniation</b> of the <b>brain</b> structures.

The autonomous responses such as the skin conductance response may also provide further insight on the patient's emotional processing.|$|R
30|$|Although {{intraoperative}} CSF drainage via lumbar {{drainage catheter}} {{is the preferred}} technique, in rare cases it can cause intracranial hypotension leading to <b>brain</b> stem <b>herniation</b> and <b>brain</b> sag after treating the aneurysmal SAH (Alaraj et al. 2011; Komotar et al. 2005; Samadani et al. 2003).

30|$|Nevertheless, {{the loss}} of too much {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) precipitating mild to severe complications is a possibility associated with these maneuvers.
