5|$|<b>Botanical</b> <b>gardens</b> {{have always}} {{responded to the}} {{interests}} {{and values of the}} day. If a single function were to be chosen from the early literature on <b>botanical</b> <b>gardens,</b> it would be their scientific endeavour and, flowing from this, their instructional value. In their formative years, <b>botanical</b> <b>gardens</b> were gardens for physicians and botanists, but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture and the needs of the general public. The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities, not by its living collections. The interest in economic plants now has less relevance, and the concern with plant classification systems has all but disappeared, while a fascination with the curious, beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of civic or {{municipal}} <b>botanical</b> <b>gardens</b> were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These did not develop scientific facilities or programmes, but the horticultural aspects were strong and the plants often labelled. They were <b>botanical</b> <b>gardens</b> {{in the sense of}} building up collections of plants and exchanging seeds with other gardens around the world, although their collection policies were determined by those in day-to-day charge of them. They tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were, indeed, often under general parks administrations.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th century, <b>botanical</b> <b>gardens</b> {{began their}} {{contribution}} to a deeper scientific curiosity about plants. If a botanical garden is defined by its scientific or academic connection, then the first true <b>botanical</b> <b>gardens</b> were established with the revival of learning {{that occurred in the}} European Renaissance. These were secular gardens attached to universities and medical schools, used as resources for teaching and research. The superintendents of these gardens were often professors of botany with international reputations, a factor that probably contributed to the creation of botany as an independent discipline rather than a descriptive adjunct to medicine.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} <b>botanical</b> <b>gardens</b> is {{closely linked to}} the history of botany itself. The <b>botanical</b> <b>gardens</b> of the 16th and 17th centuries were {{medicinal}} gardens, but the idea of a botanical garden changed to encompass displays of the beautiful, strange, new and sometimes economically important plant trophies being returned from the European colonies and other distant lands. Later, in the 18th century, they became more educational in function, demonstrating the latest plant classification systems devised by botanists working in the associated herbaria as they tried to order these new treasures. Then, in the 19th and 20th centuries, the trend was towards a combination of specialist and eclectic collections demonstrating many aspects of both horticulture and botany.|$|E

5|$|There are {{currently}} about 230 tropical <b>botanical</b> <b>gardens</b> with a concentration in southern and south-eastern Asia. The first botanical garden {{founded in the}} tropics was the Pamplemousses Botanical Garden in Mauritius, established in 1735 to provide food for ships using the port, but later trialling and distributing many plants of economic importance. This {{was followed by the}} West Indies (Botanic Gardens St. Vincent, 1764) and in 1786 by the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Botanical Garden in Calcutta, India founded during a period of prosperity when the city was a trading centre for the Dutch East India Company. Other gardens were constructed in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden, 1808), Sri Lanka (Botanical Garden of Peradeniya, 1821 and on a site dating back to 1371), Indonesia (Bogor <b>Botanical</b> <b>Gardens,</b> 1817 and Kebun Raya Cibodas, 1852), and Singapore (Singapore <b>Botanical</b> <b>Gardens,</b> 1822). These {{had a profound effect on}} the economy of the countries, especially in relation to the foods and medicines introduced. The importation of rubber trees to the Singapore Botanic Garden initiated the important rubber industry of the Malay Peninsula. At this time also, teak and tea were introduced to India and breadfruit, pepper and starfruit to the Caribbean.|$|E
