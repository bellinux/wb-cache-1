5|$|Although Keynes {{has been}} widely criticised – {{especially}} {{by members of the}} Chicago school of economics – for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact he was a firm <b>believer</b> <b>in</b> balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programs of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure {{to meet the needs of}} exceptional circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Extremists will {{probably}} deplore {{the fact that}} the composer is still a respecter of form, still a devotee of beauty, still a <b>believer</b> <b>in</b> the potency of melody; but this is rather a matter for congratulation than regret... Mr. Sibelius is a fine musical constructionist, an eloquent harmonist and a fine colorist despite his fondness for dark tints.|$|E

Darré was a firm <b>believer</b> <b>in</b> {{the superiority of}} the Nordic race, and his philosophy was a major influence on Himmler.|$|E

5|$|Henry is {{best known}} for his six marriages and, in particular, his efforts to have his first marriage, to Catherine of Aragon, annulled. His {{disagreement}} with the Pope on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation, separating the Church of England from papal authority and appointing himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Despite his resulting excommunication, Henry remained a <b>believer</b> <b>in</b> core Catholic theological teachings.|$|E

5|$|Richard {{was said}} to have been tall, good-looking and intelligent. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought {{to bring an end to}} the Hundred Years' War that Edward III had started. He was a firm <b>believer</b> <b>in</b> the royal prerogative, which led him to {{restrain}} the power of the aristocracy, and to rely on a private retinue for military protection instead; in contrast to the fraternal, martial court of his grandfather, he cultivated a refined atmosphere at his court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between king and magnates {{was caused by}} dissatisfaction with the influence of foreigners at court, and Henry's high level of taxation. In 1258 Henry was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford, that essentially left royal government {{in the hands of}} a council of magnates, but this document went through a long series of revocations and reinstatements. In 1263, as the country was on the brink of civil war, the two parties agreed to submit the matter to arbitration by the French king. Louis was a firm <b>believer</b> <b>in</b> the royal prerogative, and decided clearly in favour of Henry.|$|E
