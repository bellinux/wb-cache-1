5|$|On Russell's Top the Auckland Mounted Rifles {{were in a}} {{precarious}} position; their trenches were still far from <b>being</b> <b>fully</b> constructed, and three saps heading towards The Nek {{had yet to be}} joined up. The 19th Division, using hand grenades, attacked the New Zealanders' position in three waves. The Wellington Mounted Rifles to the north were able to bring their machine-guns to bear on the attackers. The flanking fire caused devastation amongst the Turkish ranks. At the same time the Aucklands charged them in a counter-attack, forcing the survivors to withdraw.|$|E

Thomas was a fifth-year senior who {{accumulated}} 673 rushing yards and seven touchdowns despite missing three games due to injury.

Conaty underwent surgery and played despite not <b>being</b> <b>fully</b> healed.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish is {{traditionally}} packaged in flat, round, 60-gram (2-ounce) tins, usually with an easy-open facility. Because {{the amount of}} shoe polish {{that needs to be}} applied is small, and the shoe polish will desiccate due to volatile ingredients, such as naphtha, a large container would dry out before <b>being</b> <b>fully</b> used. The traditional flat, round tins have since become synonymous with shoe polishes.|$|E

5|$|The game sold a {{total of}} 300,000 units for the ZX Spectrum and {{generated}} £1 million in revenue for Ultimate Play the Game, which enabled the Stamper brothers to gain {{a foothold in the}} early video gaming market. After the game's release, Jetpac was parodied in a long-running Crash comic strip named Lunar Jetman. The strip, designed by John Richardson, lasted from July 1984 to October 1991 and gained popular reception from readers. To develop the comic, photographs had to be processed manually on a photo-mechanical tone and then transferred to paper, later <b>being</b> <b>fully</b> colourised in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{west coast}} of Ireland, Lahinch and Donegal Bay in particular, have popular surfing beaches, <b>being</b> <b>fully</b> exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, {{creating}} good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing. Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks {{along the coast of}} Ireland, with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast.|$|E

The process appears to be unique to Wagiman within Australian languages.|$|E

After an unsuccessful short stay at Black-Foxe, Wilder returned home and became increasingly involved with the local theatre community. He performed {{for the first time in}} front of a paying audience at age 15, as Balthasar (Romeo's servant) in a production of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
5|$|Allegorical {{stories are}} central to the poetic diction of many cultures, and were {{prominent}} in the West during classical times, the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Aesop's Fables, repeatedly rendered in both verse and prose since first being recorded about 500 B.C., are perhaps the richest single source of allegorical poetry through the ages. Other notables examples include the Roman de la Rose, a 13th-century French poem, William Langland's Piers Ploughman in the 14th century, and Jean de la Fontaine's Fables (influenced by Aesop's) in the 17th century. Rather than <b>being</b> <b>fully</b> allegorical, however, a poem may contain symbols or allusions that deepen the meaning or effect of its words without constructing a full allegory.|$|E

5|$|By {{late on the}} 19th, Austrian and French {{soldiers}} had been skirmishing at outposts for more than 30 hours, with the action growing increasingly intense. In {{the early hours of}} the 21st, General Lefebvre informed Jourdan that the Austrians were attacking all his positions, and that the general engagement would begin shortly. After 24hours of fighting, Austrian forces pushed Lefebvre and Saint Cyr's troops back to the Pfullendorf heights. Although sappers blew up the primary bridge over the Ostrach river, the Austrians managed to ford the stream anyway. They nearly outflanked General Saint Cyr's forces on the right flank, did outflank Lefebvre's forces in the center, and cut off a portion of the southern flank from the main body. Saint Cyr's troops barely managed to pull back before <b>being</b> <b>fully</b> cut off. Finally, General Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze, marching north with 10,000men, from Feldkirch, threatened Ferino's First Division from the south.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Strachan {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season, Brown's former Hibs boss Tony Mowbray became Celtic manager. Brown underwent surgery during pre-season in an attempt to rectify his ankle problem, but this didn't work, and he played matches despite not <b>being</b> <b>fully</b> fit. Celtic had a fairly good start to their league campaign, going into the first Old Firm match four points ahead of Rangers, but they lost 2–1. Celtic beat Dynamo Moscow in Champions League qualifying, but then lost the play-off to Arsenal, which meant that they dropped into the Europa League group stage. The 1–0 home defeat by Hamburg on 22 October 2009 was Brown's last action of the year, as Celtic initially chose to rest him in another effort to heal the ankle injury. This proved unsuccessful, and he underwent a second operation in Rotterdam to try and clear up his ankle injury.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} become {{recognised}} fully by the American Kennel Club, they must first compete in a Miscellaneous Class. The requirements to compete in that class are to demonstrate a following by having a minimum of 100 active members in a national breed club, a population of 300 to 400 dogs, with third generation pedigrees and for all dogs in those pedigrees {{to be of the}} same breed, a distribution across twenty or more states, and the breed standard must be reviewed and approved by the AKC. Currently there are five dogs in the AKC's Miscellaneous Class which are Dogue de Bordeaux, Redbone Coonhound, Irish Red and White Setter, Norwegian Buhund and Pyrenean Shepherd. Typical stays in that class are between one and three years, and the national club of the breed must have held seminars, shows and judges workshops prior to <b>being</b> <b>fully</b> recognised.|$|E
