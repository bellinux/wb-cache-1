40|$|Abstract. Anaerobic {{treatment}} of relatively dry biomass (W= 30 - 55 %) has an advantage, {{compared to the}} traditionally used wet biomass, due to lowered expenses of the transportation of raw or finished materials. By the help of laboratory scale 5 l digesters biogas production was investigated from different biomass in anaerobic fermentation in the batch process. Inoculum from cow manure finished fermentation process was added in each digester to facilitate the anaerobic fermentation process. The lowest average yield of biogas 185 l kgvos- 1 was obtained from fresh sawdust. The methane yield (percentage of methane) obtained from different biomass was the following: fresh sawdust 83 l kgvsd- 1 (45 %); old sawdust 91 l kgvsd- 1 (46 %); <b>broiler</b> <b>manure</b> with sawdust litter 98 l kgvsd- 1 (49 %); <b>broiler</b> <b>manure</b> with slaughterhouse waste 185 l kgvsd- 1 (52 %); and grain mill wastes 132 l kgvsd- 1 (50 %) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} incubation {{study was}} conducted {{to determine the effects of}} liming on microbial activity and N mineralization in two Bizana soils amended with <b>broiler</b> <b>manure.</b> The experimental layout was a 4 x 3 complete factorial experiment with three replicates, arranged in a randomized design. Soil pH, CO 2 evolution, and mineral N concentration were measured. After 56 days the soil pH ranged from 4. 50 to 5. 74 and 4. 99 to 5. 94, in the Magusheni and Nikwe soils, respectively. The effect of liming on microbial activity and N mineralization differed between the soils. In the Nikwe soil (acid saturation 4. 0 %), microbial activity and N mineralization increased as the rate of <b>broiler</b> <b>manure</b> application was raised, but liming had no effect. In the Magusheni soil (acid saturation 25 %), microbial activity increased as both lime and chicken manure application rates increased, but liming reduced N mineralization, suggesting N immobilization was being driven by an active microbial population in the limed soils. The rates of lime and/or chicken manure application, percentage Ca 2 + and soil acid saturation were important factors influencing microbial activity and N mineralization, but the effect of soil pH on N mineralization was not evident in either of the soils...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. - Effect of broiler {{droppings}} {{has been}} studied on primary productivity, and net fish yield of major carps for one year in four earthen fish ponds. Catla catla, Labeo rohlita and Cirrhinus mrigala were stocked with a ratio of 40 : 30 : 30 to test the input of broiler droppings. Based on its nitrogen contents (4. 62 %) broiler excreta was applied {{at a rate of}} 0. 15 g nitrogen / 100 g of fish weight daily. The input of this nitrogen source significantly increased the fish weight, fork and total length. Statistically the differences were non-significant between Labeo rohita and Cirrhinus mrigala for an increase in their body weight. The plankton productivity, phyto- and zooplankton abundance and phytoplankton / zooplankton ratios were significantly different in treated and control ponds. Increase in fish yield and nitrogen incorporation efficiency of fish was found to be correlated with water temperature and plankton productivity in treated and control ponds. The plankton biomass was found to depend on the water temperature. The net fish yield of 3951. 42 and 828. 64 kg/ha/year of major carps were secured from <b>broiler</b> <b>manure</b> treated and control ponds, respectively. The suitable environment in a manured pond resulted in a significantly better growth of major carps than the control pond. In the absence of any harmful effects of ammonia on the survival of fish, the fish yields can be quite easily enhanced with an application of <b>broiler</b> <b>manure</b> at low or no cost...|$|E

It was hypothesized {{that the use of}} the two low cost residues (bagasse and chicken manure) in an animal feed could present a great nutritional potential to livestock farmers. Five treatments were made in duplicates, containing zero (control), 2. 5, 5, 7. 5 and 10 % chicken manure.

The proportional amount of phytoplankton found in guts of Catla catla, Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigala, Cyprinus carpio, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Ctenopharyngodon idella was 80 - 90 %, 70 - 80 %, 60 - 70 %, 60 - 80 %, 35 - 90 %, 28 - 75 %, respectively. The parallel zooplankton values were 10 - 15 %, 25 - 30 %, 30 - 40 %, 20 - 40 %, 20 - 30 %, 25 - 45 %, respectively.

40|$|A {{series of}} fishkills in 1997 in the Chesapeake Bay {{were linked to}} Pfiesteria piscicida, a rare toxic microorganism, and to {{nutrient}} pollution from agricultural sources. Manure from poultry production on the Delmarva Peninsula was regarded as {{the primary source of}} the excess nutrients. These fishkills served as a focusing event for policy-makers in Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware to update their scientific guidance on phosphorus management, promulgate agricultural regulations, and depart from decades of relying on voluntary technical and financial assistance to improve farm-related water quality problems. This dissertation conducts a comparative case study of these three states to determine if 1) the policy-making process in each state affects compliance by farmers and 2) if the laws improved farmer nutrient management behavior. Data sources include information gathered from interviews with 60 corn farmers on the Peninsula that use <b>broiler</b> chicken <b>manure</b> as fertilizer; interviews with over 60 policy stakeholders; and reviews of primary and secondary documents. Analytical methods include: political analysis of the main stages of the policy development process; policy analysis of the effectiveness of plan-based regulations; statistical tests to determine significant differences between states regarding farmer responses to Likert Opinion Statements and questions about their nutrient management practices; logit regression analysis to determine factors influential to low manure application rates; and a review of compliance data collected by the state regulatory agencies. Answers to both research questions are, overall, "yes," though this answer depends on which dataset of compliance and which metric of improved nutrient management behavior is reviewed; there are "no" answers as well. Results of this dissertation highlight the serious difficulty of regulating dispersed nonpoint source agricultural nutrient pollution through nutrient management plans. Several findings arise, including: plan-based agricultural regulations are in reality voluntary; plans prepared by private and public sector planners result in non-uniform standards; gaining "buy-in" from rather than "alienating" the regulated community likely results in better overall outcomes; regulations that account for on-the-ground realities of farming and state regulatory capacity likely achieve better overall outcomes; and focusing events that turn out to be weak can undermine the justification for new regulatory policies...|$|R

40|$|The {{experiment}} that aimed {{to study the}} types and various levels of manure for improving growth and production of sweet corn was conducted for 9 weeks. Completely randomized design (CRD) arranged with nested model {{was used in this}} experiment. The main plot consisted of three kind of manures, there were <b>broiler</b> <b>manure</b> (A), horse manure (K), and pig manure (B). As sub plot were levels of manure: without manure D 0 (0 ton/ha), D 1 (10 ton/ha = 87. 51 g/pot), D 2 (20 ton/ha = 175 g/pot), D 3 (30 ton/ha = 262. 5 g/pot), with three replication in each combination treatment. Variables measured in this experiment were plant high, stem diameter, fresh and dry weight of leaf, stem and maize-ear of corn, total dry weight of forage production (stem + leaf) and dry weight ratio of stem and leaf of sweet corn. The result of the experiment showed that the effect of broiler, horse, and pig manure on all variables which measured in the experiment were not significantly different (P> 0, 05). The highest growth and production of sweet corn were obtained at 20 ton/ha level for all kind of manures that used in this experiment with total dry weight of forage production 48. 88; 51. 11; and 48. 30 g/pot and dry weight of maize-ear production 23. 80; 23. 30 and 22. 00 g/pot for broiler, horse and pig manure respectively.

The identification of crop production methods that maximise energy efficiency and minimise greenhouse gas emissions is vital. Sugar beet is grown in a variety of locations and under a variety of agronomic conditions within the UK. This study identified thirteen production scenarios, representative of over 90 % of the UK beet crop, which included five soil types, nine fertiliser regimes and nine crop protection strategies. The fossil energy input, the overall energy efficiency and the global warming potential (GWP) of each production scenario was assessed. This study did not consider the processing of the beet to extract sugar. The overall energy input of the UK beet crop ranges between 15. 72 and 25. 94 GJ/ha. It produces between 7. 3 and 15. 0 times as much energy in dry matter at the sugar factory gate as consumed in its production, with an average ratio of 9. 7. It has an average GWP of 0. 024 eq. t CO 2 per tonne of clean beet harvested, equivalent to 0. 0062 eq. t CO 2 per GJ output. The energy input into each scenario was dictated largely by the energy associated with crop nutrition. The smallest energy inputs per hectare were to crops grown under organic conditions or conventional crops grown on fertile soils (clay loam, silt or peat) or sand soil with <b>broiler</b> <b>manure</b> applied. Those crops with the greatest energy input were grown on sand soil that was irrigated and had mineral fertiliser applied. Although the organic scenario grown on sandy loam soil had one of the smallest energy inputs per hectare, the low yield meant that the energy input was similar per tonne of beet harvested to the conventional crops grown on sandy loam soil. The extra distance travelled by organic beet from the farm to the factory increased the energy input per tonne above that of the conventional scenarios. The GWP was smallest for the conventional crops on the fertile peat and silt soils and greatest on the irrigated sand soils and the sandy loam soils. The organic scenario had a similar GWP to the conventional scenarios on sandy loam to the farm gate, although the greater diesel requirement for transport increased the GWP overall. The GWP per GJ of output for sugar beet in England is similar to published values for wheat...|$|E
40|$|Shober, Amy L. Long-term {{applications}} of <b>broiler</b> <b>manure</b> to Delmarva agricultural soils at rates that exceed crop uptake {{led to the}} buildup of phosphorus (P) in soils to concentrations that exceed agronomic optimum. This legacy soil P is at risk for losses through artificial drainage systems that are installed to allow agricultural production of soils with high water tables and drainage problems throughout the Delmarva region. Transport of P through artificial drainage systems to sensitive waterbodies like the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Inland Bays is an important pathway for P losses from agriculture on Delmarva. However, knowledge about the mechanism and frequency of subsurface P transport events remains limited. The objectives {{of this study were}} to: 1) develop a method for using geophysics to study subsurface flowpaths in an agricultural field; 2) better understand how P interacts with subsurface hydrology, as applied at a small field site at the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore research farm; 3) determine how subsurface P loss risk is accounted for in several P indices used for artificially drained fields; and 4) determine recommended risk factors for inclusion in a future version of the Delaware Phosphorus Site Index. Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) and a bromide (Br) salt tracer were used at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore research farm to better understand subsurface water flows and potential for P loss in subsurface lateral flow. Electrical resistivity was monitored in real time during two storm events (October 2015 and February 2016) following application of a Br tracer within a trench located within the larger ERI monitoring grid (7 m x 12. 5 m). The ERI visualization revealed the presence of tracer within and slightly below the trench (possible density dependent flow); however, minimal lateral movement was seen likely due to the low intensity of the storm events. Continued monitoring during heavier storm events at this site is recommended. Additionally, better corroboration of ERI data with both hydrologic and visual monitoring is critically needed. Phosphorus indices are field-based management tools used to identify fields with a high risk of P transport due to both site hydrology and presence of P sources. The P index is also an important tool to guide mitigation of P losses by incentivizing best management practices (BMPs). Subsurface P losses are often poorly accounted for in P indices due to lack of understanding of these processes. We compared regional (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina) P index approaches to address the risk of subsurface P loss in the subsurface. Five P indices were calculated for conditions based on collected deep (approximately 1 m) soil cores collected from 13 field sites throughout the Delmarva. Overall P index scores and risk ratings were compared among indices as calculated for individual core samples at each site. In addition, calculated subsurface P risk scores were compared to concentrations of water extractable and Mehlich 3 P in soil near the estimated seasonal high water table. Based on comparisons of P Index score to field scenarios, the Delaware P Site Index and updated version of the University of Maryland P Management Tool (PMT 2) most accurately predicted the overall P loss risk determined for various scenarios. However, the University of Maryland P Management tools (UM-PMT and PMT 2) and Virginia P Index most accurately predicted the risk for subsurface P losses (based on soil P concentrations near the seasonal high water table). We recommend that future updates to Delaware’s PSI account for risk of both leaching potential and subsurface lateral flow potential by taking into account the following factors: soil P saturation ratio, calculated runoff and percolation volume, hydrologic soil group, soil drainage class, and drainage intensity. Updated P Indices should be evaluated using measured and modeled water quality data. University of Delaware, Department of Plant and Soil SciencesM. S...|$|E
