Bunning was also outspoken on the issue of illegal immigration, taking the position that all illegal immigrants should be deported. Bunning was also {{the only member of the}} United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs to have opposed Ben Bernanke for Chief of the Federal Reserve. He said it was because he had doubts that Bernanke would <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>different</b> from Alan Greenspan.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{the success}} that Parker and Presley had achieved, Parker was still {{struggling}} to believe that Presley's career would last longer than a year or two. He had seen many acts come and go during his earlier years in management, and felt that to think that Presley, despite being Parker's most successful act to date, would <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>different,</b> was foolish. In January 1958 Presley received his draft notice from the United States Army. He was upset {{about the possibility of}} it affecting his career, but Parker was secretly overjoyed. Presley had been showing signs of rebellion against him recently, and Parker believed that a stint in the Army would cure him of this.|$|E
500|$|The 1998 {{season was}} not {{expected}} to <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>different,</b> as the Falcons had failed to reach the playoffs the previous two seasons and only made the playoffs twice in the previous fifteen seasons. However, head coach Dan Reeves, who was hired before the previous season, had overhauled the roster {{in an attempt to}} reverse the team's fortunes. Thirty-eight of the fifty-three players on the 1998 Falcons team had been brought in by Reeves over the previous year, including journeyman quarterback Chris Chandler, who had a career-best season in 1998. Running back Jamal Anderson also posted a career-high 1846 rushing yards, which led the NFC that year, and the defense finished fourth overall in points allowed. As a result, the Falcons won the NFC West with a record of 14–2 and clinched 2nd overall seed in the NFC playoffs, behind only the Vikings. The team was nicknamed the [...] "Dirty Birds" [...] after a touchdown dance created by tight end O.J. Santiago [...] but popularized by Anderson.|$|E

500|$|Accumulated fuel, old forests, and {{unabated}} and exceptionally dry conditions spelled {{trouble for}} Yellowstone. However, foresters and fire ecologists predicted a normal fire {{season for the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and anticipated normal rainfall for July. History provided little {{evidence to suggest that}} 1988 would <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>different</b> from the previous 100plus years the park had existed. But, as major fires started to break out throughout the Rocky Mountain region, the media began to take notice. Twenty small fires started in Yellowstone by July and of those, eleven went out on their own. The remainder were closely monitored in accordance with the prescribed natural fire policies. By July 15 fires throughout the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem had burned [...] and though this was not out of the ordinary, media focus on fires raging throughout the American west influenced the decision by the park officials to initiate fire suppression efforts on July 15. Within a week after suppression efforts commenced, the fires had spread to include almost [...] on the parkland alone.|$|E
500|$|He {{noted that}} Lord Hoffmann in Hall v Simons (2001) {{had said that}} a witness owed no duty of care in respect of his evidence, only a duty to tell the truth, but he {{considered}} that to be incorrect, since it failed to distinguish between witnesses of fact and experts. The expert would have {{a contract with the}} client in which he agreed to perform the duties that he owed to the court, and so there was no conflict between the two duties. In this respect, expert witnesses were more like advocates, who owed duties to client and court, than to witnesses of fact. He noted that barristers had long been immune from negligence claims until the decision of the House of Lords in Hall v Simons. Removing their immunity, he said, had not led to any diminution in advocates performing their duty to the court, and it would be [...] "mere conjecture" [...] to assume that this would <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>different</b> for expert witnesses. Neither had vexatious claims been a problem for barristers – in any event, the present case was not vexatious and there were other hurdles, both procedural and financial, in the way of an unsuccessful litigant making unmeritorious claims against an expert. As there was no justification for continuing to hold that expert witnesses were [...] "immune from suit in relation to the evidence they give in court or for the views they express in anticipation of court proceedings", he concluded that the immunity for claims for breach of duty (but not defamation) should be abolished.|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue of}} [...] "authenticity" [...] in {{relation}} to an approach like Gould's has been a topic of great debate, although diminished {{by the end of}} the 20th century—a development that Gould seems to have anticipated. It asks whether a recording is less authentic or [...] "direct" [...] for having been highly refined by technical means in the studio. Gould likened his process to that of a film director—one does not perceive that a two-hour film was made in two hours—and implicitly asks why the act of listening to music should <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>different.</b> He went so far as to conduct an experiment with musicians, sound engineers, and laypeople in which they were to listen to a recording and determine where the splices occurred. Each group chose different points based on their relationship to music, but none successfully. While the conclusion was hardly scientific, Gould remarked, [...] "The tape does lie, and nearly always gets away with it".|$|E

According to the MRD's magazine Queensland Roads, there were hopes [...] "that the construction of this building with its landscaped gardens and surroundings in the old Spring Hill area of Brisbane, [...] provide an incentive for other businesses and developers to {{follow the example of}} the Main Roads Department". Commissioner Barton viewed the MRD as [...] "a giant consulting engineers and construction organisation", and stated [...] "why should a department like Main Roads <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>different</b> from private business ... e hope that when our officers are dealing with people they will get the idea that we are here to do business just as efficiently and effectively as anybody else in the community". The Courier-Mail added that [...] "the building design, layout of office space and staff facilities, gives the Main Roads Department an air of big business, not the traditional Government department organisation", while the Mines and Main Roads Minister, Ronald Ernest Camm, claimed that the new building [...] "would {{be one of the most}} effective ways of organising Main Roads personnel and facilities for a bolder attack on the problems of the future".|$|E
2500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, saying the {{directors}} were skilled at [...] "springing surprises" [...] from the writers' [...] "ingenious" [...] screenplay.

[...] Robert Wilonsky of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "The result is pleasant and diverting, if ultimately forgettable, and it's one of the rare instances in the recent history of 3-D's resurrection as The Savior of Cinema in which the technology doesn't dim the screen or distract the focus." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York gave the film three out of five stars, saying, [...] "The setup is pure Looney Tunes, and indeed, Despicable Me is at its best when trading in the anything-for-a-laugh prankery that was a specialty of the Termite Terrace crowd." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying, [...] "Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash-quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Kids will dig it, adults will smile with amusement, and no one will <b>be</b> <b>any</b> <b>different</b> afterward than they were walking into the theater." [...] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying, [...] "Neither as rich in story nor stunning in animation as Pixar offerings, Despicable Me instead settles for simply being goofy good fun, and it hardly seems like settling at all." ...|$|E
