School <b>board</b> <b>members</b> participating in this research were volunteers. The external evaluator would supply the <b>board</b> <b>members</b> with the School Board Orientation/Evaluation Instrument (SBOEI) by mail to be returned for analysis. The evaluator would share the results of the survey during the scheduled course of treatment (orientation/evaluation training).

The evaluation component was designed to assess board perceptions of their current practice and their perceptions of how an ideal board would function in contrast with recommendations of current research;Data were collected over more than a 12 -year period.

Post-treatment experimental group <b>board</b> <b>members</b> perceived themselves to have improved overall. Their perceptions of ideal board practice did not change significantly overall. Conclusions noted that perceptions of current practice became more congruent with ideal practice after <b>board</b> <b>members</b> had received training in effective school board governance practices...|$|R
