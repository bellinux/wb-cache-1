This study investigates the potential of different sensors for geomorphologic mapping in the Brazilian Savanna region. The study area is located in the Raso Catarina region, Bahia State. Digital image processing techniques were used to enhance spectral characteristics of the geomorphologic units.

(2) The Debye shielding scenario {{depends on the}} local ion density near the cloud charge within the Debye shielding distance, causing the reduction rate of PG rather constant at all phases. In other words, it predicts smaller PG (absolute) values with the same timescale in both cases. (3) The dielectric shielding depends largely on the total numbers of shielding ions and hence, {{the distance between the}} cloud charges and the ground. Therefore, we expect different time profiles, i.e., (a) constant suppression rate of PG without change in the timescale if the cloud charges develop/decay locally and (<b>b)</b> <b>quick</b> rise and quick decay (symmetric shortening of the timescale) if the cloud charges are moving, like Fig.  1.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{application}} of Rapid Prototyping in the fabrication of a robotic hand is presented. Using the Selective Laser Sintering Sinterstation 2000 of DTM Corporation of Austin, TX, prototypes of mechanical joints were fabricated experimentally. The designs of these component joints were then used to fabricate the articulated structure of one four degree of freedom finger of a five-fingered robotic hand. This robotic finger and joints have been fabricated in one step, without requiring assembly while maintaining their desired mobility. Keywords: Rapid Prototyping, Stereolithography, Selective Laser Sintering, Robotics, Hands. INTRODUCTION Rapid prototyping of parts and tools is a rapidly deve loping technology with many advantages: a) time and money savings, <b>b)</b> <b>quick</b> product testing, c) expeditious design improvements, d) fast error elimination from design, e) increased product sales, and f) rapid manufacturing (Ashley 1995 and 1998).

5000|$|A {{former student}} of Doctor Diehard (a {{pastiche}} of Magneto and Professor X) {{and leader of}} his Zen-Men (a pastiche of the X-Men themselves), he joined the Metamilitia when Americommando became President of the U.S.A. and approved the [...] "Metahuman Act". Similar to the unfolding of events during Marvel's Civil War, the pro-registration heroes subdued the anti-registration ones; unlike the Marvel Universe wherein Cyclops and the X-Men remained neutral in the conflict, the Zen-Men on the alternative Earth of Angor were besieged by the Metamilitia, who feared their power. Although Doctor Diehard assured Americommando of their neutrality, the Zen Men were interned in a concentration camp and inhibitor chips were embedded in their hands. One-Eye switched sides, joining the Metamilitia out of fear and to avoid detention. After witnessing the rape of the Silver Sorceress (a pastiche of the Scarlet Witch) and {{the murder of her}} brother Jack <b>B.</b> <b>Quick</b> (a pastiche of Quicksilver), One-Eye damaged his chip and led the Zen-Men in rebellion.|$|R

Optimalisation of these processes in AO combined transport terminal is presented on the project in contexture on road transport vehicles. Application of GPS is signefied in combined transport providing that all transport units will be followed this way. It is necessary to unify the systems for following in combined transport not only in national standard but also international. To communication between the two relatively separately working systems must be used unified standards. Telematics contribution to dispraise of expenses and escalation efficiency by optimal operational, transport and logistics process control also in combined transport. The main aspect for solving logistics problem is regular and distortionless information about positions of mobile object inclusive their condition. Satellite system rank among modern substance of telematics. Satellite systems enable navigation, monitoring and destination position of mobile objects. Satellite systems escalate degree of garrison and freight security, and enable <b>quicker</b> <b>reverse</b> flows of information. Contribution articulates into two parts. Scopes of satellite systems utilise for combined transport control and demands for these systems are description in forepart.

40|$|Today agility of {{management}} cannot be realized unless given {{all of the}} following three kinds of quickness: a) quick recognition of environmental changes, <b>b)</b> <b>quick</b> decision-making on countermeasures against these changes, and c) quick implementation of the countermeasures chosen. In the business world nowadays the quickness of a) concerns information that an MIS deals with, the quickness of b) concerns use of an MIS for decision-making, and the quickness of c) concerns change of an MIS itself. With a focus on c) and assuming that flexibility is a core property that an MIS should acquire to realize agile management, our study aims to clarify how MIS flexibility should be enhanced. With this aim in mind, we will survey the sources and types of change demands on an MIS and consider in a structured way the characteristics that an MIS should have, such that they will conduce to its flexibility in dealing with these change demands. Having laid the groundwork mentioned so far, we will discuss practical methods to enhance MIS flexibility, and end by presenting our evaluation procedure for MIS flexibility...|$|R

5000|$|Abelard Snazz, a.k.a. [...] "the {{man with}} the two/multi-story brain", is a genius whose plans {{nevertheless}} do not work quite as intended. His first name was likely inspired by Moore's half-memory of having read about the philosopher Peter Abelard, but no specific link was implied. Snazz was Alan Moore's first recurring character for 2000 AD, and appeared in eight issues between 1980 and 1983. Snazz first appeared in Moore's third Ro-Jaws' Robo Tales strip for 2000 AD (and third work overall for that publication), in the two-part story [...] "The Final Solution", in issues #189-190. Moving briefly into the Tharg's Future Shocks for his second storyline (third appearance) in #209, Snazz then gained his own short-lived strip in #237. 'The Man with the Double-Decker Brain' is a mutant with two brains and two sets of eyes (occasionally adorned by two sets of glasses). Convinced - with some accuracy - of his own genius, he acted as a consultant inventor, [...] "offering to handle complex problems with even more complicated solutions," [...] and shared many character traits that Moore would return to with the America's Best Comics character Jack <b>B.</b> <b>Quick</b> in his Tomorrow Stories anthology comic, two decades later.|$|R
