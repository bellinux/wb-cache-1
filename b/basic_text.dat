25|$|Rickover {{preferred}} life {{on smaller}} ships, {{and he also}} knew that young officers in the submarine service were advancing quickly, so he went to Washington and volunteered for submarine duty. His application was turned down due to his age, at that time 29 years. Fortunately for Rickover, he ran into his former commanding officer from Nevada while leaving the building, who interceded successfully on his behalf. From 1929 to 1933, Rickover qualified for submarine duty and command aboard the submarines S-9 and S-48. While at the Office of the Inspector of Naval Material in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1933, Rickover translated Das Unterseeboot (The Submarine) by World War I German Imperial Navy Admiral Hermann Bauer. Rickover's translation became a <b>basic</b> <b>text</b> for the U.S. submarine service.|$|E

Developers humorously named the character Pip [...] "Tsumaru" [...] in Japanese (which means [...] "packed") as a pun on their attempts to pack as much content into the game as possible. To avoid the burden of writing unique, accented dialogue for several characters, team member Kiyoshi Yoshii coded a system that produces accents by modifying <b>basic</b> <b>text</b> for certain characters. Art director Nobuteru Yuuki initially wanted the characters to appear in a more chibi format with diminutive proportions. The game world's fusion of high technology and ethnic, tribal atmospheres proved challenging at first. He later recalled striving to harmonize the time period's level of technology, especially as reflected in characters' garb.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{begins with}} {{a survey of the}} textual {{foundations}} of capital punishment both in the Jewish law and the United States Constitution. The <b>basic</b> <b>texts</b> of the Jewish law and the Constitution are examined for their treatment, or lack thereof, of capital punishment. They are then scrutinized for any potential mitigatory effect on the imposition, structure, and use of capital punishment. Having established the foundational law, this essay continues by tracing the actual judicial development of capital punishment law in both systems. A comparison is conducted of the interpretation applied to the <b>basic</b> <b>texts</b> by the highest judicial court of each system. The essay concludes by contrasting the two wholly divergent judicial interpretational experiences to divine root causes of the present structure of, and judicial attitude towards, capital punishment in the United States...|$|R

2500|$|Early in {{the history}} of NA, {{different}} groups emphasized different aspects of recovery. In particular, the make-up and process of creating an NA text was a contentious period for the fellowship. Different factions supported different versions of the <b>Basic</b> <b>Text,</b> and in the ensuing power struggle there were many accusations made and resentments cultivated. The basis of the dispute was whether the service committees were described as a part of NA, or as a separate entity, basically a tool of the NA groups with no decision-making power; instead being charged collecting the decisions of the NA groups themselves. This dispute reached its nadir when the NA World Service Office sued an NA member in an attempt to prevent him from distributing free versions of the <b>Basic</b> <b>Text.</b> [...] Today there are some NA groups who use a self-produced version of the <b>Basic</b> <b>Text</b> that {{has come to be known}} as the Baby Blue which is basically the Third Edition, Revised <b>Basic</b> <b>Text</b> (except that it contains originally approved essays on the Traditions).
