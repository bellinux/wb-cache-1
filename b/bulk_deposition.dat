The analysis based on the latter model resulted in a rotation angle of 608 for the adsorbed Te layer against the the Au(111) lattice. This value was not consistent with that expected from the adsorbate structure of the first upd layer of Te, i. e., (√ 3 x √ 3) R 30 °.

A {{synthesis}} of the biogeochemistry of S was done during 34 yr (1964 – 1965 to 1997 – 1998) in reference and human-manipulated forest ecosystems of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH.

40|$|This {{study is}} part of the {{long-term}} monitoring of Finnish arable land and it is based on soil analyses of 705 monitoring sites sampled in 1998. The same sites were sampled twice previously,in 1974 and 1987. We describe here the state of the Finnish cultivated soils in 1998 and changes in soil quality since 1987. The samples were analysed for organic C, volume weight, pH, P, K, Ca, S, Mg, Al, B, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Se and Zn. Macronutrients were extracted with 0. 5 M ammonium acetate + 0. 5 M acetic acid (pH 4. 65) and most micronutrients, Al and heavy metals with the same solution + 0. 02 M Na 2 EDTA. Hot water was used to extract B and Se. From 1987 to 1998, soil P, Ca, Mg, S, Cr, Cu, Zn, volume weight and electrical conductivity increased and soil K, B, pH and organic C decreased. There was no change in soil Al, Cd, Mn and Ni. Between 1987 and 1998,the use of P,K,B and Cu in mineral fertilisers declined whereas that of Ca in liming agents and Zn in mineral fertilisers increased. With the exception of P and Cu,these changes affected the concentrations of easily soluble macro- and micronutrients in the soil accordingly. The slight decrease in soil pH might be due to the increase in the use of fertliser N. The finding that soil Cd and Ni ceased to increase and that soil Cr increased only slightly was attributed to the dramatic reduction in national emissions and <b>bulk</b> <b>depositions</b> of heavy metals. ...|$|R
40|$|Water soluble organic {{nitrogen}} (WSON) compounds are ubiquitous in precipitation {{and in the}} planetary boundary layer, and therefore are a potential source of bioavailable reactive nitrogen. This paper examines weekly rain data {{over a period of}} 22 months from June 2005 to March 2007 collected in 2 types of rain collector (<b>bulk</b> <b>deposition</b> and “dry+wet ” deposition) located in a semi-rural area 15 km southwest of Edinburgh, UK (N 55 ° 51 ′ 44 ″, W 3 ° 12 ′ 19 ″). <b>Bulk</b> <b>deposition</b> collectors are denoted in this paper as “standard rain gauges”, and they are the design used in the UK national network for monitoring precipitation composition. “Dry+wet ” deposition collectors are flushing rain gauges and they are equipped with a rain detector (conductivity array), a spray nozzle, a 2 -way valve and two independent bottles to collect funnel washings (dry deposition) and true wet deposition. On average, for the 27 weekly samples with 3 valid replicates for the 2 types of collectors, dissolved {{organic nitrogen}} (DON) represented 23 % of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in <b>bulk</b> <b>deposition.</b> Dry deposition of particles and gas on the funnel surface, rather than rain, contributed over half of all N-containing species (inorganic and organic). Some discrepancies were found between bulk rain gauges and flushing rain gauges, for deposition of both TDN and DON, suggesting biological conversion and loss of inorganic N in the flushing samplers...|$|E
40|$|The main sources {{contributing}} to heavy metal content in mosses in Lithuania were examined by {{a comparison of}} heavy metal concentrations in moss and corresponding deposition levels calculated from <b>bulk</b> <b>deposition</b> analysis. <b>Bulk</b> <b>deposition</b> was collected in open areas as well as under the canopy of trees. Uptake efficiencies in moss were calculated for Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, V and Zn. All elements in moss except Pb and Cd appeared to {{be more or less}} influenced by sources other than air pollution. The general order of this influence on the heavy metal content in moss was observed as follows: Ni < V < Cr < Zn < Fe < Mn. The contents of Mn and Zn in moss were greatly influenced by leaching from the canopy while Pb was the only element which showed a net metal retention by the canopy. Concentrations of Fe and Cr in moss were dominating due to contribution from soil dust. 01998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|Acceleration of {{anthropogenic}} emissions in China has substantially increased nitrogen (N) deposition {{during the last}} 3 decades and may result in an imbalance of atmospheric N and phosphorus (P) inputs in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the status of P deposition in China is poorly understood. This study synthesized data on total P and total N concentrations in bulk precipitation and throughfall from published literature to assess the characteristics of P deposition, N deposition and N : P deposition ratio in China's forests. Our results show relatively high mean rates of bulk P deposition (0. 38  kg P ha − 1  yr − 1) and total P deposition (0. 69  kg P ha − 1  yr − 1), but they were accompanied by even more elevated N inputs via <b>bulk</b> <b>deposition</b> (16. 5  kg N ha − 1  yr − 1) and total deposition (21. 6  kg N ha − 1  yr − 1), resulting in high N : P ratios in <b>bulk</b> <b>deposition</b> (44. 4) and total deposition (32. 8). Based on the difference between total deposition and <b>bulk</b> <b>deposition,</b> canopy-captured dry P and N deposition {{was estimated to be}} 0. 31  kg P ha − 1  yr − 1 and 5. 1  kg N ha − 1  yr − 1, respectively. We found significantly higher P deposition and lower N : P ratios at sites nearby than those far from semiarid regions. The estimated bulk and total deposition of P and N both showed a significant power-law increase with decreasing distance to the nearest large cities either in the areas nearby or far from semiarid regions. Our results suggest an anthropogenic alternation of regional P and N cycling, which may shift large areas of China's forests towards human-induced P limitation especially in southern China...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{advent of}} the cold spray process has {{permitted}} <b>bulk</b> spray <b>deposition</b> of oxidation-sensitive materials such as aluminum. Particle-reinforced aluminum matrix composites (Al-MMCs) exhibit lower wear rates and more stable friction than their un-reinforced matrix materials. This improvement in tribological behavior is useful for various aerospace applications, such as coating of magnesium gearbox components.

40|$|This study {{employed}} real-time in situ STM imaging {{to examine}} the adsorption of PEG molecules on Pt(111) modified by a monolayer of copper adatoms and the subsequent <b>bulk</b> Cu <b>deposition</b> in 1 M H 2 SO 4 + 1 mM CuSO 4 + 1 mM KCl + 88 μM PEG. At the end of Cu underpotential deposition (∼ 0. 35 V vs Ag/AgCl), a highly ordered Pt(111) -(√ 3 × √ 7) -Cu + HSO 4 − structure was observed in 1 M H 2 SO 4 + 1 mM CuSO 4. This adlattice restructured upon the introduction of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, molecular weight 200) and chloride anions. At the onset potential for <b>bulk</b> Cu <b>deposition</b> (∼ 0 V), a Pt(111) -(√ 3 × √ 3) R 30 °-Cu + Cl− structure was imaged with a tunneling current of 0. 5 nA and a bias voltage of 100 mV. Lowering the tunneling current to 0. 2 nA yielded a (4 × 4) structure, presumably because of adsorbed PEG 200 molecules. The subsequent nucleation and deposition processes of Cu in solution containing PEG and Cl− were examined, revealing the nucleation of 2 - to 3 -nm-wide CuCl clusters on an atomically smooth Pt(111) surface at overpotentials of less than 50 mV. With larger overpotential (η > 150 mV), Cu deposition seemed to bypass the production of CuCl species, leading to layered Cu deposition, starting preferentially at step defects, followed by lateral growth to cover the entire Pt electrode surface. These processes were observed with both PEG 200 and 4000, although the former tended to produce more CuCl nanoclusters. Raising [H 2 SO 4] to 1 M substantiates the suppressing effect of PEG on Cu deposition. This STM study provided atomic- or molecular-level insight into the effect of PEG additives on the deposition of Cu...|$|R
40|$|Humans are {{attracted}} by the fertile properties of volcanic soils and currently around 10 % of the world population lives within active volcanic areas. Volcanoes emit significantly amounts of potentially toxic elements such as selenium (Se), {{even in the absence}} of obvious volcanic activity. Although Se is an essential element for humans, ingestion of an excess amount of Se can produce adverse effects. Mt. Etna, the biggest volcano in Europe, is persistently active for the last 200, 000 years and one of the most intensely monitored volcanoes. We have studied selenium in rainwater and soils from Mt Etna volcano. <b>Bulk</b> <b>depositions</b> were collected from April 2006 to December 2007, using a network of five rain gauges, located at various altitudes around the summit craters. Highest Se concentrations (up to 13 µg/L) have been found close to the emission vent, confirming the prevailing volcanic contribution to rainwater composition close to the summit craters. The deposition rate for Se was estimated to be 1. 7 µg m- 2 day- 1 nearby to the summit vents, to 0. 5 µg m- 2 day- 1 at the local background site on the upwind western sector. Thirty soils collected at the flanks of the volcano show total concentrations between 0. 1 and 2. 2 ppm. Lab-controlled experiments with these soils and synthetic rainwater show that up to 5 % of the Se is mobilized during soil-rain water interaction. The trace element deposition of the plume cannot explain the observed spatial trends. However, the stage of soil development plays an important role in the behaviour of Se within the soils. Our results have implications for the chemical composition of the Etnean aquifer. Additional, the mobility of soil Se influences the bioavailability and potential toxicity through agricultural activities, essential to the local economy...|$|R
