60|$|Ah, how he {{had loved}} it! The green garden path, the tufts of flowers, purple and white columbines, and great oriental red poppies with their <b>black</b> chaps and <b>mulleins</b> tall and yellow, this flamy garden which had been a garden for a {{thousand}} years, scooped out in the little hollow among the snake-infested commons. He had made it flame with flowers, in a sun cup under its hedges and trees. So old, so old a place! And yet he had re-created it.|$|R
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Verbascum has not undergone any significant revision since Svanve Mürbeck's monographies in the 1930s, {{with the exception}} of the work of Arthur Huber-Morath, who used informal group in organizing the genus for the florae of Iran and Turkey to account for many intermediate species. Since Huber-Morath's groups are not taxonomical, Mürbeck's treatment is the most current one available, as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or molecular data extensively to the genus. In Mürbeck's classification, V.thapsus is placed in section Bothrospermae subsect. Fasciculata (or sect. Verbascum subsect. Verbascum depending on nomenclatural choices) alongside species such as Verbascum nigrum (<b>black</b> or dark <b>mullein),</b> Verbascum lychnitis (white mullein) and Verbascum sinuatum (wavy-leaved mullein).|$|R
