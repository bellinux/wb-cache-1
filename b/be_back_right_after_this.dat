50|$|Also, {{during the}} Hmong New Year celebration, house spirits {{as well as}} the spirit of wealth (xwm kab) are honored. In addition, if a shaman is in the house, the healing spirits of She-Yee are also honored and {{released}} to wander the land (Neeb Foob Yeem)—similar to vacationing after a long year of working—until they <b>are</b> called <b>back</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> new year. Hmong New Year lasts only for 3 days—with 10 dishes of food each day, for a total of 30 dishes—thus the Hmong saying “eat 30.” Here are a few practices that the Hmong observe during their New Year Celebration, performed anytime during the 3 days of celebration.|$|R

The Ava {{garrison}} at Sandoway fell before Ava reinforcements (8000 troops, 300 horses, 30 elephants) led by Minye Kyawswa arrived. Ava forces laid siege to {{the city for the}} next three months. But they had to retreat in early 1412 when Minkhaung recalled the troops to defend against Hanthawaddy's ally Hsenwi (Theinni), which had opened a new front by invading Ava territory in the north.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, in {{accordance}} with then-current regulations set by the Federal Communications Commission that required a distinction between programs and commercials, most children's programming bumpers would include the phrase [...] "We'll <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>after</b> these messages", except for the bump before the final commercial break, which would usually say, [...] "And now, these messages."

5000|$|Dozens {{of unique}} spells {{can be learned}} from scrolls that use the various {{elements}} of nature (wind, earth, fire, and water). Each character has to learn the spells individually with no spell sharing allowed. Spells are lost when the character that was holding them temporarily disappears from the party along with any armed weapon or armor that he was carrying. The equipment and spells <b>are</b> gained <b>back</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> the character re-joins the group. Symbols determine the effects of the spell. For example, a spell with an up arrow is a spell that increases the target's stats and a spell with a flame symbol on it is considered to be an attack spell (regardless of which element that spell actually belongs to). At the start of the game, a dying woman assigns the player the challenge of [...] "conquering the world." [...] For every enemy encounter that the player overcomes in battle, the warriors gain gold pieces and experience points. The combat system and some of the music used in the game is borrowed from vintage Final Fantasy games such as Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy IV.|$|R
