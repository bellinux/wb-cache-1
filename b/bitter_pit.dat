50|$|Several {{decades of}} {{research}} in several countries with many cultivars showed that moderate levels of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> could be controlled with the spraying of the trees with calcium chloride or calcium nitrate during the growing season. However, in the southern hemisphere where highly susceptible fruit had to be harvested early for export to Europe, the problem remained. An attempt to increase the calcium content by applying calcium after harvest had resulted in severe injury to the fruit. Export of susceptible apples from New Zealand was under threat and new methods for controlling <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> were investigated. While it was shown that <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> was reduced as calcium levels rose, {{it was not possible}} to determine a minimum level of calcium that would ensure that the disorder was controlled. The most effective treatment found for closed calyx fruit was to submerge the fruit in the calcium chloride solution and to apply a vacuum and immediately rinsing in water. This overcame the injury problem and gave much better control of the disorder. The vacuum treatment was commercialized in New Zealand for the Cox's Orange Pippin cultivar in 1978 and was used for several years. However the treatment was expensive and could not be used for open calyx cultivars.|$|E

50|$|Granny Smith is {{much more}} easily {{preserved}} in storage than other apples, a factor which has greatly contributed to its success in export markets.

This cultivar needs fewer winter chill hours and a longer season to mature the fruit, so it is favoured for the milder areas of the apple growing regions. However, they are susceptible to superficial scald and <b>bitter</b> <b>pit.</b> Superficial scald may be controlled by treatment with diphenylamine before storage. It can also be controlled with low-oxygen storage. Pit can be controlled with calcium sprays during the growing season and with postharvest calcium dips.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bitter</b> <b>pit</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important physiological disorders affecting apple fruit production, causing soft discrete pitting of the cortical flesh of the apple fruits which renders them unmarketable. The disorder is heritable; however, the environment and cultural practices play a major role in expression of symptoms. <b>Bitter</b> <b>pit</b> has been shown to be controllable to a certain extent using calcium sprays and dips; however, their use does not entirely prevent the incidence of the disorder. Previously, <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> has been shown to be controlled by two dominant genes, and markers on linkage group 16 of the apple genome were identified that were significantly associated with the expression of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> symptoms in a genome-wide association study. In this investigation, we identified a major QTL for <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> defined by two microsatellite (SSR) markers. The association of the SSRs with the <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> locus, and their ability to predict severe symptom expression, was confirmed through screening of individuals with stable phenotypic expression from an additional mapping progeny. The data generated in this current study suggest a two gene model could account for the control of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> symptom expression; however, only one of the loci was detectable, most likely due to dominance of alleles carried by both parents of the mapping progeny used. The SSR markers identified are cost-effective, robust and multi-allelic and thus should prove useful for the identification of seedlings with resistance to <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> using marker-assisted selection in apple breeding programs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bitter</b> <b>pit</b> is a {{physiological}} disorder {{that occurs in}} apple, pear, and quince and {{has been associated with}} calcium uptake or lack thereof. Although <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> has been studied for over a century, there is still not enough knowledge about <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> and why there are no completely effective preventive treatments to reduce fruit loss. In a previous group publication (Val et al. 2006), it was conjectured after SDS-PAGE that an unknown 18 kDa protein might contribute to bitter pito The objective {{of the present study was}} to identify this 18 kDa protein and get more extensive data on the proteomic changes associated to <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> using the latest mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Healthy and <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> fruit samples (Malus domesica 'Reinette gris du Canada' and Malus domestica 'Golden Smoothee') were collected near Zaragoza (Aragón, Spain). Following phenol extraction, ten µg protein were allowed to run on SDS-PAGE, trypsin digested, and digestion products were analyzed on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were identified with X!Tandem pipeline software ([URL] and relative quantification was performed by spectral counting. More than two hundred proteins were identified in the range of 12 - 24 kDa. We focused on 35 proteins that varied significantly between the two conditions (<b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> vs. healthy) being over/under expressed. There were 26 and 22 <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> proteins ('Reinette gris du Canada' and 'Smoothee Golden Delicious,' respectively) detected with at least 50 % greater abundance when compared to their respective healthy counterparts. Among these proteins, 14 found in both cultivars, were identified as Pathogenesis-related protein Bet v 1, a major allergen found in trees within the order Fagales. In both apple cultivars, 2 proteins were identified as thaumatin-like protein (TLP), a group of proteins responsible for several fruit allergies. Glutathione S-transferase, linked to protein binding and heat shock transcriptional factors (Hsfs) in Malus, was abundantly detected in <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> samples for both cultivars. Several proteins identified near or at 18 -kDa, are related to Malus domestica' response to stress, desiccation, and increased protein binding.

The role of free and conjugated calcium in maintaining cellular integrity and the relationship between biochemical and fluorescence changes and development of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> were investigated.

Another diagnostic model based on changes in the proportion of calcium oxalate content during storage in comparison with harvest was developed to identify samples with higher propensity to <b>bitter</b> <b>pit.</b> Also chlorophyll fluorescence was investigated as a non-destructive method for monitoring fruit during storage and prediction models for detecting changes in the maturity of fruit and developing <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> and reduction of fluorescence during storage as an alert to identify incidence of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> were developed. Furthermore, changes in gene expression profiles of a limited number of genes like calmodulin showed the differences in patterns of transcripts between apples suffering from <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> and healthy apples.

40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric) (Horticulture)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. <b>Bitter</b> <b>pit</b> {{fruit in}} {{commercial}} consignments of apples still poses an economic threat to exporters from South Africa. <b>Bitter</b> <b>pit</b> develops pre-harvest, but gets progressively worse during storage {{and is only}} traceable once the lesions appear after storage. Accurate, early indications of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> incidence will allow for remedial pre-harvest measures in the field, e. g. Ca foliar applications, to reduce the potential losses. Similarly, the automatic detection of a <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> fruit during packing will reduce financial losses by identifying unacceptable fruit before shipping. Fluorescence imaging is a fast, non-destructive technique, able to evaluate numerous fruits individually. Results of pre-harvest imaging on apples to identify fruit susceptible to <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> showed that pitted fruit were correctly classified, but misclassification of non-pitted fruit with fluorescence imaging was still too high. NIR-spectroscopy point meter readings could distinguish visible <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> lesions from healthy tissue. Important wavelengths associated with visible <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> were identified. This technique could also identify immature apples, more prone to <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> development. It could however not distinguish between <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> and non-pitted fruit when applied randomly on the calyx end of apples at harvest. Pre-harvest foliar applications to increase fruit Ca content and reduce <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> incidence, is a standard practice world wide. External Ca uptake by fruit was monitored to determine the efficacy of applications during different stages of fruit development. Two periods of efficient uptake of external Ca were identified, viz., cell division and {{the last few weeks}} before harvest. Foliar Ca applications from 40 days after full bloom were more effective in increasing fruit Ca content and reducing <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> incidence than at 80 days after full bloom, which was recommended previously. Mineral analysis of fruit has been used with variable success to predict <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> prior to harvest. The possibility of increasing the accuracy of existing predictive models by using analysis of individual fruit rather than pooled samples, was investigated. By improving the normality of different mineral distributions and decreasing the overlap between pitted and non-pitted fruit classes, it was attempted to improve the reliability of predictions based on variable threshold values. The Ca distribution showed a variation between pitted and nonpitted classes, but still a significant overlap between classes reduced the accuracy of the predictive capacity of this distribution. Even though our results produced a correct classification of 85 % for non-pitted fruit, which can be useful, this was still below the required tolerance, of less that 2 %, expected on the market. The effect of pruning and fruit bearing position on two-year-old wood on dry mass and Ca allocation of fruit was determined. ‘Golden Delicious’ fruit set was the lowest at the basal bearing position compared to the other positions evaluated and was contrary to expectations. Fruit in a terminal bearing position was superior to the basal position regarding total dry weight and fruit size. Distal wood possibly inhibited growth and set on the basal position via auxin distribution. Ca allocation differed between seasons and cultivars and could either be influenced by bearing position or presence or absence of re-growth...|$|E

40|$|<b>Bitter</b> <b>pit</b> is a {{physiological}} disorder that significantly reduces {{the quality of}} apples. Although it has been detected {{since the beginning of}} the last century, still there is little known about the mechanism of its occurrence. According to numerous studies, <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> is formed as a result of calcium deficiency in the fruit. Some authors cite the high concentration of gibberellins, later in the production season, most probably caused by excessive activity of the roots, as the chief causative factor. Beside Ca, there are several factors that can also contribute to its development, like imbalance among some mineral elements (N, P, K and Mg), cultivar, rootstock, the ratio of vegetative and generative growth, post-harvest treatments and the storage methods. There are some prediction models available that can estimate the risk of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> in apples, but even those are not always reliable. The aim of this review was to encompass the pre and postharvest factors which cause <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> and point out the directions for solving this problem...|$|E

Posteriormente, foram separadas em quatro lotes, de acordo com a severidade de "bitter pit": nula (0 lesão/fruto), baixa (1 - 2 lesões/fruto), moderada (3 - 4 lesões/fruto) e alta (5 - 16 lesões/fruto), com 15 frutos (repetições) em cada nível de severidade. Os frutos de cada lote foram analisados individualmente quanto aos teores de Ca, Mg, K e N, na casca e na polpa. Na análise univariada dos teores minerais da polpa, observou-se aumento nos níveis de K e da relação K/Ca com o aumento na severidade de "bitter pit", apesar da ausência de diferenças quanto aos teores de Ca. Na casca, os teores de Ca e de N diminuíram, e as relações K/Ca, Mg/Ca e (K+Mg) /Ca aumentaram com o incremento da severidade do distúrbio. Pela análise canônica discriminante (análise multivariada), observou-se que a melhor separação entre níveis de severidade de "bitter pit" foi obtida com os teores de Ca na casca. Assim, para maçãs 'Fuji', é mais seguro fazer previsão da ocorrência de "bitter pit" durante a armazenagem, com base nos teores de Ca na casca do que na polpa. Frutos com teor de Ca na casca This {{study was}} carried out to identify the mineral attributes in the flesh and skin tissues better related to <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> severity in 'Fuji' apples. 'Fruit were harvested in a commercial orchard in Southern Brazil (Lages, SC), and left for four months in conventional cold storage (at 0 ± 0. 4 ºC and 90 - 95 % RH). Subsequently, fruits were divided into four lots according {{to the level of}} <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> severity: none (0 pit/fruit), low (1 - 2 pits/fruit), moderate (3 - 4 pits /fruit), and high (5 - 16 pits /fruit). There were 15 fruit replicates for each level of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> severity. Mineral analysis of Ca, Mg, K, and N in the skin and in the flesh tissues were performed on individual fruits of each severity level. The univariate analysis in the fresh tissue showed an increase of K content and of the K/Ca ratio with the increase of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> severity, despite of no difference of Ca contents. In the skin, Ca and N contents reduced, and K/Ca, Mg/Ca, and (K+Mg) /Ca ratios increased with the increase of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> severity. However, the canonical discriminant analysis (multivariate analysis) showed that the best segregation between levels of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> severity was achieved with the Ca content in the skin. Therefore for 'Fuji' apples, it is safer to predict the occurrence of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> during cold storage by assessing the Ca content in the skin rather than the in flesh. Fruit with Ca content in the skin < 240 mg kg- 1 of fresh matter are susceptible to <b>bitter</b> <b>pit...</b>|$|E
40|$|O "bitter pit" é um distúrbio fisiológico pós-colheita em maçãs, ocasionado pela deficiência de Ca e agravado pela presença de elevados níveis de Mg, N e K nos frutos. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a viabilidade prática da infiltração de maçãs 'Gala' com Mg, visando a avaliar, em pré-colheita, o risco de ocorrência de "bitter pit" durante o armazenamento refrigerado, bem como a identificar os atributos minerais do fruto associados à ocorrência do distúrbio. Em 50 talhões de pomares localizados no município de Fraiburgo-SC, foram coletadas amostras de 25 frutos / talhão, cerca de 20 dias antes do início da colheita comercial, sendo os mesmos infiltrados a vácuo com Mg e avaliados quanto à incidência (%) e severidade (manchas / fruto) de "bitter pit". Nos mesmos talhões, na maturação comercial, foram coletadas amostras de 120 frutos / talhão, sendo que 100 frutos foram armazenados em câmara fria convencional durante quatro meses (0 ± 0, 5 ºC e 90 - 95 % UR), e 20 frutos foram utilizados para a análise mineral (teores de Ca, Mg, K e N). Cinco dias após a remoção da câmara fria, os frutos foram avaliados quanto à incidência (%) e severidade (manchas / fruto) de "bitter pit". Houve correlação linear altamente significativa (r² = 0, 69; p <b>Bitter</b> <b>pit</b> is a postharvest {{physiological}} disorder in apples, related to Ca deficiency, and aggravated by {{high levels of}} Mg, N, and K in the fruits. This work was carried out to assess the practical viability of 'Gala' apples infiltration with Mg, for preharvest identification of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> risk during cold storage, as well as, to identify the mineral attributes associated with the occurrence of the disorder. Fruits were sampled in 50 plots of apple orchards located in Fraiburgo, SC (Southern Brazil). Samples of 25 fruits / plot were harvested about 20 days before commercial harvesting, and then vacuum infiltrated with Mg and assessed for incidence (%) and severity (pits / fruit) of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit.</b> Samples of 120 fruits were harvested in the same plots, at the commercial maturity. One hundred fruits were stored in conventional cold storage for four months (0 ± 0. 5 ºC and 90 - 95 % RH) and 20 fruits were analyzed for mineral content (Ca, Mg, K, and N). Cold stored fruit were assessed for incidence (%) and severity (pits / fruit) of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> five days after removal from storage. There was a highly significant linear correlation (r² = 0. 69; p< 0. 001) between the incidence of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> assessed in fruits infiltrated with Mg and in fruits left in cold storage. In both, fruits infiltrated with Mg and fruits left in cold storage, there was a decrease in Ca {{and an increase in}} N contents with increases of incidence and severity of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit.</b> Results show that preharvest infiltration of 'Gala' apples with Mg is a viable method to identified plots in a commercial orchard with risk to manifest <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> during cold storage...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi identificar atributos nutricionais, quantificados na polpa e na casca dos frutos, que melhor discriminam quanto à severidade de "bitter pit" em maçãs 'Gala'. Depois de quatro meses de armazenamento em atmosfera normal (0 - 1 °C; 90 - 95 % UR), os frutos foram separados em quatro lotes, de acordo com a severidade de incidência de "bitter pit": nula (nenhuma lesão por fruto), baixa (1 - 2 lesões por fruto), moderada (3 - 4 lesões por fruto) e alta (5 - 13 lesões por fruto). Foram determinados os teores de Ca, Mg, K e N na casca e na polpa em frutos individuais (doze frutos de cada lote). A análise univariada mostrou que os frutos com sintomas de "bitter pit" apresentaram menor teor de Ca na casca e na polpa, maior teor de K na casca e maiores valores das relações K/Ca, Mg/Ca, N/Ca, (K+Mg) /Ca e (K+Mg+N) /Ca, tanto na casca como na polpa. Todavia, quando todos os atributos nutricionais avaliados na casca e na polpa foram submetidos à análise canônica discriminante (análise multivariada), a melhor discriminação entre frutos sem "bitter pit" e frutos com severidade de incidência de "bitter pit" de baixa a alta é obtida com a relação K/Ca na casca, seguido, em menor grau, pelas relações Mg/Ca e N/Ca na polpa. The {{objective}} of this work was to identify nutritional attributes, assessed in the flesh and skin tissues, that provide a better discrimination regarding <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> severity in 'Gala' apples. After four months in regular cold storage (0 - 1 °C; 90 - 95 % RH), fruits were segregated into four lots with different levels of <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> severity: null (none pit per fruit), low (1 - 2 pits per fruit), moderate (3 - 4 pits per fruit), and high (5 - 13 pits per fruit). Nutritional analysis (Ca, Mg, K and N) in the skin and in the flesh tissues were performed on twelve individual fruits of each severity level. The univariate analysis showed that fruits with <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> symptoms had lower concentration of Ca in the skin and flesh tissues, a higher concentration of K in the skin tissue, and higher values for K/Ca, Mg/Ca, N/Ca, (K+Mg) /Ca, and (K+Mg+N) /Ca ratios in the skin and flesh tissues than fruits without <b>bitter</b> <b>pit.</b> However, the canonical discriminant analysis (multivaried analysis) showed that, out of all nutritional attributes assessed in the skin and flesh tissues, K/Ca ratio in the skin provides the best discrimination between fruit with <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> and fruit without the disorder, followed by Mg/Ca and N/Ca ratio in the flesh tissue...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bitter</b> <b>pit</b> is {{the most}} {{economically}} important physiological disorder affecting apple fruit production. Brown pits develop in the cortical apple flesh – due to {{the breakdown of the}} cell plasma membranes – especially during storage, rendering the fruit unmarketable. Environmental conditions and cultural practices play a role in symptom expression, and there is a link between the severity of symptoms and relative concentrations of calcium in the fruit, leading to the application of calcium sprays and dips; however, these are not completely effective. Cultivars vary in susceptibility and thus there is scope for breeding for resistance. In this investigation, we have identified two major QTL controlling <b>bitter</b> <b>pit</b> symptom expression in four large apple mapping populations. The QTL intervals were defined using SSR and SNP markers, and candidate genes from both intervals were characterised. The markers identified will be useful for marker assisted selection in programmes for the genetic improvement of cultivated apple...|$|E
