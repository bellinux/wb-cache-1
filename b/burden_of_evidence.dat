Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy {{concluded}} that the Fifth Circuit failed to apply strict scrutiny in its decision affirming the admissions policy. Instead, he wrote, the Fifth Circuit held that Fisher could only challenge [...] "whether the University's decision to use race as an admissions factor 'was made in good faith.' It presumed that the school had acted in good faith and gave petitioner the burden of rebutting that presumption". Kennedy argued that per the Grutter ruling, the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> primarily lies with the university [...] "to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity".|$|E
50|$|Prey luring {{in general}} is confounded by false interpretation. The {{difficulty}} {{is that there are}} a number of other behavioural interpretations for a wiggling appendage, and luring-like motions are associated with several other behavioural contexts (e.g., defence, stress, etc.). Caudal luring is thought to have evolved from a caudally localised intention movement (a behaviour derived from locomotor movements). Essentially, the act of remaining stationary while sensing prey produces general nervous system excitation that gets released in the form of tail movements. Caudal luring is not merely tail undulations, but must specifically be attractive to prey. Caudal distraction is another behaviour used by snakes, and the tail motions are very similar to caudal luring. The difference is in the snake's posture and especially in the nature and outcome of the behaviour in reference to the encounter with prey. Other caudal luring-like movements occur as warning signals and are induced by stressful circumstances. Thus identifying caudal luring entails observing the effect that tail movements have on prey species, a <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> that is woefully lacking in much of the literature on this intriguing behaviour.|$|E
5000|$|Most likely Maximinus was of Thraco-Roman origin (believed so by Herodian in his writings). According to the {{notoriously}} unreliable Augustan History (Historia Augusta), {{he was born}} in Thrace or Moesia to a Gothic father and an Alanic mother, an Iranian people of the Scythian-Sarmatian branch; however, the supposed parentage is highly unlikely, as the presence of the Goths in the Danubian area is first attested after the beginning of the Crisis of the Third Century. British historian Ronald Syme, writing that [...] "the word 'Gothia' should have sufficed for condemnation" [...] of the passage in the Augustan History, felt that the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> from Herodian, Syncellus and elsewhere pointed to Maximinus having been born in Moesia. The references to his [...] "Gothic" [...] ancestry might refer to a Thracian Getae origin (the two populations were often confused by later writers, most notably by Jordanes in his Getica), as suggested by the paragraphs describing how [...] "he was singularly beloved by the Getae, moreover, as if he were one of themselves" [...] and how he spoke [...] "almost pure Thracian".|$|E
50|$|The basic {{outline of}} a section 7 {{horizontal}} acquisition case is familiar.

5000|$|Arguments for emotivism {{focus on}} what {{normative}} statements express when uttered by a speaker. A person who says that killing is wrong certainly expresses her disapproval of killing. Emotivists claim {{that this is all}} she does, that the statement [...] "killing is wrong" [...] is not a truth-apt declaration, and that the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> is on the cognitivists who want to show that in addition to expressing disapproval, the claim [...] "killing is wrong" [...] is also true. Emotivists ask whether there really is evidence that killing is wrong. We have evidence that Jupiter has a magnetic field and that birds are oviparous, but as yet, we do not seem to have found evidence of moral properties, such as [...] "goodness". Emotivists ask why, without such evidence, we should think there is such a property. Ethical intuitionists think the evidence comes not from science or reason but from our own feelings: good deeds make us feel a certain way and bad deeds make us feel very differently. But is this enough to show that there are genuinely good and bad deeds? Emotivists think not, claiming that we do not need to postulate the existence of moral [...] "badness" [...] or [...] "wrongness" [...] to explain why considering certain deeds makes us feel disapproval; that all we really observe when we introspect are feelings of disapproval. Thus the emotivist asks why not adopt the simple explanation and say that this is all there is, rather than insist that some intrinsic [...] "badness" [...] (of murder, for example) must be causing feelings when a simpler explanation is available.|$|E

This institute is the concentration of the procedure, principle of which is to bring about the state of termination of facts and evidence, which means that parties of the civil procedure are allowed to present facts important for the decision of the court and evidence connected with them only until a certain moment, if they present them later, they will not be relevant for the court.

For example, when an event happens in a state that gives rise to a lawsuit - if two parties are involved in an automobile accident, for example - that state in which the accident occurred provides the parties with certain [...] "vested rights". These rights include such things as the ability of a plaintiff to file a lawsuit, the imposition of a statute of limitations to prevent a defendant from being subjected to a lawsuit after too much time has passed, limitations on recovery, and specified <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> These so-called vested rights compete with the policy claims of other states for their laws to be applied.

Three different understand- ings of precaution arise in the policy process around this case, and in the relevant actors’ view of precaution and the perceived relationship be- tween science and politics.

We think that such evidence can tell us whether a decision is preference sensitive; how patients feel about important health outcomes, treatment goals, and decisions; and whether preferences vary in different types of patients. The likely effects of reviewing the literature are a general sensitization to the importance of preferences in decision making, the recognition that some decisions are simply all about preferences, a more considered approach to forming preferences among patients and other stakeholders, and more effective integration of preferences into decisions.

40|$|Social {{justice is}} a contested concept.

40|$|The first genetically {{modified}} crops and foods to be approved for commercial use in the European Union have prompted intense controversy. Food retailers and processors {{have been forced to}} take up the concerns voiced by their customers. New networks of groups have formed to oppose the technology. In response to these pressures, regulators who approved the products have had to reconsider questions they had previously dismissed or officially resolved. Governments have devised more precautionary measures of various kinds. For example, they have increased the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> for demonstrating safety, have broadened the practical definition of the ‘adverse effects’ which must be prevented, and have devised marketstage precautions for such effects. These extra measures manage the risk debate as well as any risks. In such ways, the technocratic model of European harmonization is being challenged and superseded. This may allow differences in national practices to be viewed as valuable expert resources for a different harmonization model, rather than as deviations from a universal rational norm. Regulatory conflicts offer precautionary opportunities, which could lead to more flexible and democratic procedures.
