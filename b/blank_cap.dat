50|$|The caravan {{stops in}} a small town to study magic and assist the Duke of Emelan with the drought. As Daja is working in the smithy, a woman, a wirok, a scorned Trader who negotiates with lugsha, tradesmen, stops by to talk to the smith. As she notices the <b>blank</b> <b>cap</b> on Daja's Trader staff which signifies her exile status, the Trader refuses to talk to her.|$|E
50|$|Stubs for RTs, the BC, or BMs, are {{generally}} {{connected to the}} bus through coupling boxes, which may provide a single or multiple stub connections. These provide the required shielding (â‰¥ 75 percent) and, for transformer coupled stubs, contain the coupling transformers and isolation resistors. They have two external connectors through which the bus feeds, and one or more external connectors to which the stub or stubs connect. These stub connectors should not be terminated with matching resistors, but left open circuit when not used, with <b>blanking</b> <b>caps</b> where necessary. One of the bus connectors may be terminated where the bus coupler is physically {{at the end of}} the bus cable, i.e. it is not normally considered essential to have a length of bus cable between the last bus coupler and the termination resistor.|$|R
50|$|The Happy Hacking Keyboard {{is a small}} {{computer}} keyboard produced by PFU Limited of Japan, co-developed with Japanese computer pioneer Eiiti Wada. Its reduction of keys from the common 104 keys layout down to 60 keys in the professional series {{is the basis for}} its smaller size while retaining full key size. It returns the control key to its original position as on the early 84 key PC AT and XT layouts. The current models in production are the Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2, Professional JP, both either dark or light colors, Type-S silenced variants and <b>blank</b> key <b>caps</b> variants, and the Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite 2 with an additional Macintosh specific variant and a blank variant for each.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Catesby, {{turning into}} Bashford's Lane, {{lost in a}} moment all this life and colour. The hum of distant voices {{certainly}} reached there, but that was all, for Bashford's Lane, a retiring thoroughfare facing a <b>blank</b> dock wall, <b>capped</b> here and there by towering spars, set an example of gentility which neighbouring streets had long ago decided crossly was impossible for ordinary people to follow. Its neatly grained shutters, fastened back by {{the sides of the}} windows, gave a pleasing idea of uniformity, while its white steps and polished brass knockers were suggestive of almost a Dutch cleanliness.|$|R
5000|$|A {{starting}} pistol or starter pistol is a blank handgun that is fired to start {{track and field}} races, as well as competitive swimming races at some meets. The sound of the gun going off serves as the signal for the athletes to begin the event. Starter guns [...] "cannot fire real ammunition or be modified to fire real ammunition." [...] Beside sporting events, they are also used in films and in TV or stage shows. <b>Blank</b> shells or <b>caps</b> are used to prevent expelling projectiles, and only small amount of smoke can be seen when shot. Starting pistols may also include modified versions of standard pistols incapable of firing bullets, most commonly achieved by welding an obstruction into the barrel. This is less common nowadays, especially in Western countries. When electronic timing is used, a sensor is often affixed to the gun, which sends an electronic signal to the timing system upon firing. For deaf competitors or for modern electronic systems, a light may be used instead.|$|R
