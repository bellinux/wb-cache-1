5|$|A {{calculated}} {{titration curve}} for oxalic acid is {{shown at the}} right. Oxalic acid has pKa values of 1.27 and 4.27. Therefore, the <b>buffer</b> regions will be centered at about pH 1.3 and pH 4.3. The <b>buffer</b> regions carry the information necessary to get the pKa values as the concentrations of acid and conjugate base change along a <b>buffer</b> region.|$|E
5|$|<b>Buffer</b> {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a <b>buffer</b> solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The <b>buffer</b> capacity of a simple <b>buffer</b> solution is largest when pH=pKa. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate <b>buffer.</b> At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E

5|$|Between the two <b>buffer</b> regions {{there is}} an end-point, or {{equivalence}} point, at about pH 3. This end-point is not sharp and is typical of a diprotic acid whose <b>buffer</b> regions overlap by a small amount: pKa2 − pKa1 is about three in this example. (If the difference in pK values were about two or less, the end-point would not be noticeable.) The second end-point begins at about pH  6.3 and is sharp. This indicates that all the protons have been removed. When this is so, the solution is not buffered and the pH rises steeply on addition of {{a small amount of}} strong base. However, the pH does not continue to rise indefinitely. A new <b>buffer</b> region begins at about pH 11 (pKw − 3), which is where self-ionization of water becomes important.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{crossbar}} {{fabric is}} widely used as the interconnect of high-performance packet switches due to its low cost and scalability. There are two main variants of the crossbar fabric: unbuffered and internally <b>buffered.</b> On one hand, unbuffered crossbar fabric switches exhibit the advantage of using no internal <b>buffers.</b> However, they require a complex scheduler to solve input and output ports contention. Internally, <b>buffered</b> crossbar fabric switches, on the other hand, overcome the scheduling complexity by means of distributed schedulers. However, they require expensive internal buffers—one per crosspoint. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, namely, the Partially <b>Buffered</b> Crossbar (PBC) switching architecture, where {{a small number of}} separate internal <b>buffers</b> are maintained per output.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Buffered</b> {{crossbars}} {{have emerged}} as an advantageous switch architecture mainly due to their scheduling efficiency and capacity to operate directly on variable size packets. Such operation requires crosspoint <b>buffers</b> at least as large as one maximum packet each. When we cannot afford that large crosspoint <b>buffers,</b> {{we are forced to}} segment packets. Although variable-size segments can be used to avoid padding overheads, we are still left with the cost of reassembly <b>buffers</b> and the associated delays. This paper applies packet mode scheduling to <b>buffered</b> crossbars in order to remedy these shortcomings: the segments of a variable-size packet are switched consecutively in time. We propose two scheduling schemes: probabilistic and deterministic packet mode scheduling. The probabilistic case allows cut-through forwarding and operates with independent crossbar output schedulers, but it requires reassembly <b>buffers.</b> Deterministic scheduling sacrifices some scheduler independence in order to eliminate the reassembly <b>buffers.</b> Using simulation we show that it performs very close to <b>buffered</b> crossbars with no segmentation and large <b>buffers</b> at the crosspoints. 1...|$|R
