The German defenders quickly repulsed this however and Tatham-Warter organised a stronger attack, to <b>be</b> <b>led</b> by Grayburn.|$|E

5|$|After {{the demise}} of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus {{restored}} the outward façade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates, and the legislative assemblies. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including supreme military command, and those of tribune and censor. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could <b>be</b> <b>led</b> under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself Princeps Civitatis ("First Citizen of the State"). The resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate, {{the first phase of the}} Roman Empire.|$|E

Cantor, who was 33 at the time, had been valedictorian of that year's graduating class at the Jewish Theological Seminary. The {{decision}} was not accepted by all congregants; the Conservative movement had ordained its first female rabbi, Amy Eilberg, only three years before, in 1985, and following Cantor's appointment a number of families left the synagogue to form B'nai Avraham, an Orthodox congregation in Brooklyn Heights.|$|E

Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the plutonium purification and production work being carried out at Los Alamos, the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, and Ames Laboratory in Iowa.

5|$|Herodotus {{provides}} a dubious account of Darius's ascension: Several days after Gaumata had been assassinated, Darius {{and the other}} six nobles discussed {{the fate of the}} empire. At first, the seven discussed the form of government; a democratic republic was strongly pushed by Otanes, an oligarchy was pushed by Megabyzus, while Darius pushed for a monarchy. After stating that a republic would lead to corruption and internal fighting, while a monarchy would <b>be</b> <b>led</b> with a single-mindedness not possible in other governments, Darius was able to convince the other nobles.|$|E
5|$|In 1799 the 49th was {{assigned}} to the Helder Expedition against the Batavian Republic (now known as the Netherlands), to <b>be</b> <b>led</b> by Sir Ralph Abercromby. During the troop landings, Brock saw his first combat on 10 September 1799 under the command of then-Major-General John Moore. Given that the 49th was in poor shape when Brock took command, they saw little actual combat. Likely Moore was sparing them and using more experienced troops to establish the beachhead. Finally on 2 October the 49th was actively involved in heavy combat at the Battle of Alkmaar, where they acquitted themselves well, sustaining only 33 deaths.|$|E

Grenier also hoped to draw from newly published Inuit testimony collected by oral historian Dorothy Harley Eber. Some of Eber's informants have placed the location of one of Franklin's ships in the vicinity of the Royal Geographical Society Island, an area not searched by previous expeditions. The search was to also include local Inuit historian Louie Kamookak, who has found other significant remains of the expedition and would represent the indigenous culture.|$|E

5|$|Over the winter, with Test {{vacancies}} beckoning, Davidson and Benaud became training {{partners and}} decided to bowl for three hours continuously {{on a daily basis}} through the winter off season. With Ray Lindwall dropped, Davidson and Benaud became Australia's leading paceman and spinner when the team for the 1957–58 tour of South Africa was announced. It was a heavy burden on Davidson, who had only taken two Test wickets in an innings four times, and three wickets in a Test match on one occasion. The team was to <b>be</b> <b>led</b> by Ian Craig, who had played only six Tests, and at the age of just 22 years, he was the youngest ever Test captain from any country.|$|E
5|$|Republican leaders {{struggled}} {{to come to}} terms with popular sentiment; some wanted passionate armed struggle; others a more reasoned approach. Some leaders, such as the leftist Tan Malaka, spread the idea that this was a revolutionary struggle to <b>be</b> <b>led</b> and won by the Indonesian pemuda. Sukarno and Hatta, in contrast, were more interested in planning out a government and institutions to achieve independence through diplomacy. Pro-revolution demonstrations took place in large cities, including one led by Tan Malaka in Jakarta with over 200,000 people, which Sukarno and Hatta, fearing violence, successfully quelled.|$|E
