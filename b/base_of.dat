40|$|AbstractA matroid may be {{characterized}} by the collection <b>of</b> its <b>bases</b> or by the collection of its circuits. Along with any matroid is a uniquely determined dual matroid. Given the <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> a matroid, {{it is possible to}} show that base complements are precisely the <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the dual. So it is easy to construct <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the dual given the <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the original matroid. This paper provides two results. The first enables construction of all circuits of the dual matroid from circuits of the original matroid. The second constructs all <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> a matroid from its circuits...|$|R

5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf {{with a special}} glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} {{the shape of the}} egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched {{but in the case of}} Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall to the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the plant.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the family}} Apiaceae bear close {{resemblance}} to each other, and have many characteristics in common. Cicuta spp. are often mistaken for edible plants such as kvanne (Angelica archangelica), wild celery (Apium graveolens), pignut (Conopodium majus), wild carrot (Daucus carota), wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), and water parsnip (Berula spp.). One of the more common misidentifications is between water hemlock and water parsnip; both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas, and both have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers. Differences between water parsnip and water hemlock include the water parsnip having leaves only once compound while the water hemlock has leaves which are {{two or three times}} compound. Water hemlock also has a large swelling at the stem base which water parsnip lacks. Additionally, water hemlock has bracts at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> each small flower cluster, not at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the main flower head, while water parsnip has both bracts at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> flowers and also at the main flower head.|$|E
