40|$|We use {{the theory}} of Gröbner-Shirshov <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> ideals to {{construct}} linear <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> graded local Weyl modules for the (hyper) current and the truncated current algebras associated to the finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra sl_ 2. The main result is a characteristic-free construction of <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> this important family of modules for the hyper current sl_ 2 -algebra. In the positive characteristic setting this work represents the first construction in the literature. In the characteristic zero setting, the method provides a different construction of the Chari-Pressley (also Kus-Littelmann) bases and the Chari-Venkatesh <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> local Weyl modules for the current sl_ 2 -algebra. Our construction allows us to obtain new <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> the local Weyl modules for truncated current sl_ 2 -algebras with very particular properties. Comment: 22 pages.
