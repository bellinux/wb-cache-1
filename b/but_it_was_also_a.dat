5|$|After {{the death}} of Marcellus in 23BC, Augustus married his {{daughter}} to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Vipsania Julia, Agrippina the Elder, and Postumus Agrippa, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering {{the eastern half of}} the Empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean. This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.|$|E

I don’t know if that means I sound old or I sound intelligent. I’m going to hope that it’s the latter.|$|E

25|$|Prior to its conquest in the Nine Years War of the 1590s, Ulster was {{the most}} Gaelic part of Ireland and the only {{province}} that was completely outside English control. The war, of 1594–1603, ended with the surrender of the O'Neill and O'Donnell lords to the English crown, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> hugely costly and humiliating episode for the English government in Ireland. In the short term the war failed, and generous surrender terms given to the rebels re-granted them much of their former land, but under English law.|$|E
25|$|York's hostile {{attitude}} toward the Council's surrender of the French province of Maine, in return for {{an extension of the}} truce with France and a French bride for Henry, must have contributed to his appointment on 30 July 1447 as Lieutenant of Ireland. In some ways it was a logical appointment, as Richard was also Earl of Ulster and had considerable estates in Ireland, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> convenient way (for his enemies at court) of removing him from both England and France. His term of office was for ten years, ruling him out of consideration for any other high office during that period.|$|E
25|$|Although {{much of the}} Unit's early output {{concentrated}} on British and European wildlife, one of its first productions to be broadcast was Faraway Look featuring Peter Scott in Australia. The early programmes were limited by the available technology, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> time of great experimentation in style and content, bringing the Unit notable success. Animal Magic (1962–1983), presented by Johnny Morris and Tony Soper, was a successful format for young audiences which ran for over 20 years. The Unit also collaborated with Gerald Durrell on several films of his animal-collecting expeditions, beginning with the studio-based series 'To Bafut for Beef' (April 1958), using African footage shot by Durrell.|$|E

25|$|The Army was reconstructed {{after the}} War, based among {{others on the}} forces {{established}} in exile in Sweden and Great Britain during the War, {{as well as on}} domestic forces. The participation in the allied occupation of Germany was a very demanding task for the Army in the period of 1946–52, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> part of the reconstruction. The Army was established {{in all parts of the}} country, with a significant stronghold in Troms based on the threat picture of that time: the fear of an invasion from the East. This picture definitely changed with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent break-up of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.|$|E
25|$|Though {{government}} had {{been dominated by}} the Conservative Party {{for more than a}} decade, the new century saw much favourable legislation enacted in Ireland's interest. An electoral swing to the Liberal Party in the 1906 general election renewed Redmond's opportunities for working with government policy. The Liberals, however, did not yet back his party's demands for full Home Rule, which contributed to a renewal of agrarian radicalism in the ranch wars of 1906–1910. Redmond's low-key and conciliatory style of leadership gave the impression of weakness but reflected the problem of keeping together a factionalised party. He grew in stature after 1906 and especially after 1910. As far as Redmond was concerned, the Home Rule movement was interested in promoting Irish nationality within the British Empire, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> movement with a visceral antipathy to the English and their colonies.|$|E
25|$|When Damala left, {{she took}} on a new leading man and lover, the poet and playwright Jean Richepin, who {{accompanied}} her on a quick tour of European cities to help pay off her debts. She renewed her relationship with the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII. When they returned to Paris, Bernhardt leased the theater of Porte Saint-Martin and starred in a new play by Richepin, Nana-Sahib, a costume drama about love in British India in 1857. The play and Richepin's acting were poor, and it quickly closed. Richepin then wrote an adaptation of Macbeth in French, with Bernhardt as Lady Macbeth, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> failure. The only person who praised the play was Oscar Wilde, who was then living in Paris. He began writing a play, Salomé, in French, especially for Bernhardt, though it was quickly banned by British censors and she never performed it.|$|E

25|$|The band's origins can {{be traced}} to 1981, in Bradford, Yorkshire, where vocalist and {{songwriter}} Ian Astbury formed a band called Southern Death Cult. The name was chosen with a double meaning, and was derived from the 14th century Native American religion, the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex or Southern Death Cult as it was sometimes known, from the Mississippi delta area, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> stab at what the band viewed was the centralisation of power in Southern England (including that of the music industry); there has long been a perceived notion of a North-South divide based on social, historic and economic reasons. Astbury was joined by Buzz Burrows (guitar), Barry Jepson (bass) and Aki Nawaz Qureshi (drums); they performed their first show at the Queen's Hall in their hometown of Bradford on 29 October 1981. The band were at the forefront of an emerging style of music, in the form of post-punk and gothic rock (then known as positive-punk), they achieved critical acclaim from the press and music fans.|$|E
25|$|The {{murder of}} Colonel Ramírez {{was just one}} act in a macabre war by the Medellín Cartel against the Colombian State {{in its attempt to}} outsmart it. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> {{milestone}} which resulted in the fight against the cartel being quickly strengthened with the international support of the DEA in order to hunt down the main ringleaders. On August 18, 1989 a successor of Ramírez, Colonel Waldemar Franklin Quintero, was also murdered by the same cartel, but 4 months later, on December 15, 1989 justice received its first meaningful victory in that war with the death of Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha, alias The Mexican. The next success was when Pablo Escobar Gaviria, alias El Patrón, surrendered himself to the authorities in 1991, however he made sure that the Colombian government would agree to a non-extradition regulation so that he could not be extradited to the United States. Afterwards, he escaped and tried to create his own war against the State, but he was shot down by the Police Special Force on December 2, 1993.|$|E

[...] In the same year, Lady Saigō had a temple founded in her mother's memory, {{indicating}} she had died by that point. [...] In 1586, Lady Saigō was at the side of Ieyasu when he entered the newly reconstructed Sunpu Castle in triumph. [...] This was a highly symbolic celebration of his victories over his enemies and the subjugation of the region, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> visible and symbolic gesture to Lady Saigō, a way that Ieyasu could credit her for her assistance, and publicly demonstrate the esteem in which he regarded her.|$|E

500|$|In The Gospel According to The Simpsons, Mark I. Pinsky {{writes that}} the episode has [...] "the {{structure}} of an exquisitely crafted twenty-two minute sermon." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson felt that [...] " [...] helped establish the show’s reputation as a master lampooner of pop culture. The introduction of cable into the home allowed [...] to mock many different movies and other media outlets, and this helped make the episode very entertaining. It also worked in many other ways and offered a fine show." [...] Writing for MacLean's magazine, Jaime J. Weinman described [...] "Homer vs. Lisa and the Eighth Commandment" [...] as [...] "the first truly great episode— the one that established The Simpsons as the funniest and most multi-layered sitcom around. The story of Homer stealing cable was an excuse for dozens of parodies of early 90s cable TV, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> story about Homer and his daughter and an examination of how we rationalize little acts of theft in our daily lives." ...|$|E

[...] Engineers at the time decided it was not feasible. [...] The plan was brought back in 1921, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> failure. [...] 1935 would see the last attempt of such a project, but while a new dam was finished in 1936, it produced no electricity. [...] In 1940 rural electrification finally powered the property.|$|E
2500|$|Grand Duchess Vera {{spent her}} {{early years in}} St Petersburg and in 1861, {{the family moved to}} Warsaw when her father was {{appointed}} Viceroy of Poland. [...] Vera was a troubled child, prone to violent fits of anger, and suffered what was officially described as a [...] "nervous condition". She became so unmanageable that her parents decided to send her to her aunt, Grand Duchess Olga, Queen of [...] Württemberg, who agreed {{to take care of her}}. On 7 December 1863, Grand Duke Constantin and his wife arrived with nine-year-old Vera in Stuttgart, entrusting her care to the childless King Karl of Württemberg and Queen Olga. Officially this was ascribed to the more advanced medical treatment the child would receive in Germany, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> way for Vera's parents to hide her embarrassing illness from the Russian court. Queen Olga was happy to take care of her niece in spite of the difficulties, and for Vera, her aunt eventually took the place of her mother.|$|E

2500|$|However several {{qualifications}} exist. First, if {{a representation}} was made during negotiations, which later transpires {{to be no}} longer true, there is a duty to make a correction. So in With v O'Flanagan where Dr O'Flanagan told Mr With that his medical practice earned £40 per week, but when the contract was signed the income had dropped to £5 per week, Dr O'Flanagan was under a duty to correct himself. Representations are continuing. Second, one cannot simply tell half truths, as for instance in Dimmock v Hallett, where a land vendor said two farms were fully let but did not say the tenants had given notice to quit. This was misrepresentation. Third, {{it can be a}} misrepresentation when a person says they are [...] "unaware" [...] of something, but have in fact done no checks. This was the situation in Notts Patent Brick and Tile Co v Butler, where a land purchaser asked the vendor's solicitors whether there were any restrictive covenants and the solicitor (without bothering to find out) said he was unaware of any. It was true that the solicitor was unaware, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> misrepresentation.|$|E

The gun room was in the stern area of the gun deck, to which passengers had no access due to it being the storage space for powder and ammunition for the ship's cannons and any other weapons belonging to the ship. The gun room might also house a pair of stern chasers, small cannons used to fire out {{the stern of the}} ship. Forward on the gun deck in the bow area was a windlass, equipment similar in function to the capstan in steerage, which was used to raise and lower the ship's main anchor. [...] There were no stairs for the passengers on the gun deck to go up through the gratings to the main deck. [...] To get up to the main deck, passengers were required to climb a wooden or rope ladder.|$|E
2500|$|Saint Petersburg has {{a longstanding}} and world famous {{tradition}} in literature. Dostoyevsky called it [...] "The most abstract and intentional {{city in the}} world", emphasizing its artificiality, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> symbol of modern disorder in a changing Russia. It frequently appeared to Russian writers as a menacing and inhuman mechanism. The grotesque and often nightmarish image {{of the city is}} featured in Pushkin's last poems, the Petersburg stories of Gogol, the novels of Dostoyevsky, the verse of Alexander Blok and Osip Mandelshtam, and in the symbolist novel Petersburg by Andrey Bely. According to Lotman in his chapter, 'The Symbolism of Saint Petersburg' in Universe and the Mind, these writers were inspired by symbolism from within the city itself. The effect of life in Saint Petersburg on the plight of the poor clerk in a society obsessed with hierarchy and status also became an important theme for authors such as Pushkin, Gogol and Dostoyevsky. Another important feature of early Saint Petersburg literature is its mythical element, which incorporates urban legends and popular ghost stories, as the stories of Pushkin and Gogol included ghosts returning to Saint Petersburg to haunt other characters as well as other fantastical elements, creating a surreal and abstract image of Saint Petersburg.|$|E
