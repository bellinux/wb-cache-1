2500|$|Brigadier General Edward Chaytor, {{commanding}} the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, moved his headquarters {{up to the}} <b>boundary</b> <b>post</b> [...] south-east of Rafa, immediately behind the Auckland Mounted Rifles. Half an hour later, the attack was seen to be steadily progressing all along the line. By 12:15 the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment had {{come up to the}} front line, between the Canterburys on the right, and the Aucklanders on the left, within [...] of El Magruntein, while the 2nd Battalion of the Camel Brigade advanced to extend the line held by their 1st Battalion. Shortly afterwards, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment linked up with the left of the 5th Mounted Brigade, completing the cordon around the Ottoman Army entrenchments. To the left of the 5th Mounted Brigade, the 7th Light Car Patrol reached the Rafa road, where they found cover from which to direct fire on to the A1 and A2 redoubts [...] away. Meanwhile, the batteries had pushed forward about [...] from their previous positions and [...] "B" [...] Battery HAC stopped firing on the [...] "C" [...] group of redoubts. Switching targets to the A1 and A2 redoubts, it recommenced firing at a range of [...] in support of the 5th Mounted Brigade.|$|E
60|$|Our beasts {{were worn}} out, their riders equally so; but we {{called up the}} last of our failing {{strength}} to make a creditable finish of the race. The coulée was left behind us, and Lane's figure grew larger ahead, for Mackay, who certainly did not wish to, declared he could see no <b>boundary</b> <b>post.</b> Then as the first crimson flushed the horizon, a lonely homestead rose out of the grass, and when Lane rode straight for it the sergeant swore in breathless gasps. A little smoke curled from its chimney, for the poorer ranchers rise betimes in that country. We saw Lane drop from the saddle and disappear within the door, while when we drew bridle before it, two gaunt brown-faced men came out and regarded us stolidly.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{various aspects of}} the effect of {{eccentricity}} in overturning restraint devices used in light-framed wood shear walls is discussed. To accurately assess the demand on the tension end post, nonlinear finite element modeling is used to investigate the effect that sheathing/nailing can have on the <b>boundary</b> <b>posts</b> in shear walls. Results are presented at both the allowable stress design level and at the strength limit state, and these results are compared against a bare post analysis. Additionally, both one and two story conditions are analyzed. The results show that the sheathing/nailing can significantly reduce the internal post stresses, and this reduction is proportional to post stiffness and nail spacing. Finally, {{various aspects of the}} In-Grade testing program used to determine wood resistance values in the United States are discussed because of the impact they have on the actual distribution of strength in a given grade of lumber...|$|R
