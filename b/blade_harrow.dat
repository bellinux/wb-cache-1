40|$|In the {{semi-arid}} tropics (SAT), 33 % {{area are}} occupied by Alfisols and related soils. In SAT these soils have low structural stability and thereby tend to form seal and crusts at the surface. Due to this {{a large proportion}} of the rain that falls on Alfisols during the early part of the rainy season,is normally lost as runoff thus causing high soil loss as well as moisture stress to crops. Two tillage studies were conducted first at plot scale (320 m 2) during 1991 - 95 and second at small watershed scale (1. 45 ha) during 2007 - 10,at ICRISAT research station,Hyderabad,India. These studies were conducted to find out whether the problem of excessive runoff and soil loss during the early part of the rainy season can be controlled by various inter-row tillage systems in addition to normal intercultivation by breaking the crust or seal and thereby improving infiltration and soil moisture and reducing runoff and soil loss. The observations on rainfall,runoff,soil moisture,soil loss,soil surface roughness and crop yields were collected from both the studies. Results from these studies have shown that inter-row tillage in addition to normal intercultivation is found effective in controlling early season runoff and soil loss and increasing crop yields. The additional tillage systems are found most effective during low and medium rainfall years and not so much during high rainfall years. The additional tillage with shoe cultivators,which creates rough soil surface (11 mm depression storage),is found most effective in increasing crop yields and reducing runoff and soil loss. The additional tillage with <b>blade</b> <b>harrow</b> which generates smooth soil surface is relatively less effective. In most rainfall conditions,the normal intercultivation with one additional tillage is found adequate for controlling early season runoff and improving soil moisture and crop yields...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} {{work has been}} carried out at Central Research Station farm of Dr. PDKV, Akola and at Katkheda and Sutala village of the Akola and Bulbhana district respectively. The operations considered were land preparation, sowing, intercultural, harvesting and crop residue management etc. The inputs like human power, bullock power for traditional operation were studied in entire work of the research. Similarly, for the same crops these operations were carried out by the mechanized practice for the exact quantification of the operational energy input. The study reflects the energy use patterns in mechanized and traditional farming and optimized energy efficient cropping system through mechanized farming over traditional farming. The practices evaluated for the crop production which resulted in the high yielding of crop and the crop residues. On the basis of results obtained, it was observed that the traditional operational energy requirement increases from 2680. 78 MJ/ha in traditional method to 3130. 72 MJ/ha in mechanized method for green gram crop. While, there is decrease in cost of operation from Rs 8407. 5 /ha in traditional method to Rs 5147. 0 /ha in mechanized system. Similar trend was observed in cotton, soybean, sorghum and wheat crop. For all the crops seed bed preparation is done by tractors in traditional as well as mechanized method except in mechanized method land smoothening is done by self propelled tiller instead of bullock drawn <b>blade</b> <b>harrow.</b> In most of the crops the farm operations were mechanized with different implements except harvesting operation, due to unavailability of appropriate machine for harvesting of crops except wheat crop. Overall it seen that the application of modern implements and machineries for the crop production over the traditional practices reduces the cost of production which surely impact on the crop production and the net income of the farmers. </p...|$|E

6000|$|The Blade, {{it must be}} understood--especially by the Blade's friends--spends {{his time}} in a whirl of dissipation. That is the {{symbolism}} of the emphatic obliquity of the costume. First, he drinks. The <b>Blade</b> at <b>Harrow,</b> according to a reliable authority, drinks cherry brandy and even champagne; other Blades consume whisky-and-soda; the less costly kind of Blade does it on beer. And here the beginner is often at a loss. Let us say he has looked up the street and down, ascertained that there are no aunts in the air, and then plunged into his first public-house. How shall he ask for his liquor? [...] "I will take a glass of ale, if you please, Miss," [...] seems tame for a Blade. It may be useful to know a more suitable formula. Just at present, we may assure the Blade neophyte, it is all the rage to ask for [...] "Two of swipes, ducky." [...] Go in boldly, bang down your money as loudly as possible, and shout that out {{at the top of your}} voice. If it is a barman, though, you had better not say [...] "ducky." [...] The slang will, we can assure him, prove extremely effective.|$|R
6000|$|Then the Blade gambles; {{but over}} the {{gambling}} of the Blade it is well to draw a veil--a partially translucent and coquettish veil, through which {{we can see the}} thing dimly, and enhanced in its enormity. You must patronise the Turf, of course, and have money on horses, or you are no Blade at all, but a mere stick. The <b>Harrow</b> <b>Blade</b> has his book on all the big races in the calendar; and the great and noble game of Nap--are not Blades its worshippers wherever the sun shines and a pack of cards is obtainable? Baccarat, too. Many a glorious Blade has lost his whole term's pocket-money at a single sitting at that noble game. And the conversation of the Blade must always be brilliant in the extreme, like the flashing of steel in the sunlight. It is usually cynical and worldly, sometimes horrible enough to make a governess shudder, but always epigrammatic. Epigrams and neat comparisons are much easier to make than is vulgarly supposed. [...] "Schoolmasters hang about the crops of knowledge like dead crows about a field, examples and warnings to greedy souls." [...] "Marriage is the beginning of philosophy, and the end is, 'Do not marry.'" [...] "All women are constant, but some discover mistakes." [...] "One is generally repentant when one is found out, and remorseful when one can't do it again." [...] A little practice, and this kind of thing may be ground out almost without thinking. Occasionally, in your conversation with ladies, you may let an oath slip. (Better not let your aunt hear you.) Apologise humbly at once, of course. But it will give them a glimpse of the lurid splendour of your private life.|$|R
