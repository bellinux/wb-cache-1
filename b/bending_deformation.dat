40|$|Curved crystal, {{focusing}} monochromators featuring cubed-root thickness profiles typically employ side-clamped cooling {{to reduce}} thermally induced overall <b>bend</b> <b>deformation</b> of the crystal. While performance is improved, residual <b>bend</b> <b>deformation</b> {{is often an}} important limiting factor in the monochromator performance. A slightly asymmetric “I-beam ” crystal cross section with cubed-root flange profiles has been developed to further reduce this effect. Physical motivation, finite-element modeling evaluation and performance characteristics of this design are discussed. Reduction of high mounting stress at the fixed end of the crystal required the soldering of an Invar support fixture to the crystal.

5000|$|Ionic polymer-metal {{composites}} (IPMCs) are synthetic composite nanomaterials {{that display}} artificial muscle behavior under an applied voltage or electric field. IPMCs {{are composed of}} an ionic polymer like Nafion or Flemion whose surfaces are chemically plated or physically coated with conductors such as platinum or gold. Under an applied voltage (1-5 V for typical 10mmx40mmx0.2mm samples), ion migration and redistribution due to the imposed voltage across a strip of IPMCs result in a <b>bending</b> <b>deformation.</b> If the plated electrodes are arranged in a non-symmetric configuration, the imposed voltage can induce all kinds of deformations such as twisting, rolling, torsioning, turning,twirling, whirling and non-symmetric <b>bending</b> <b>deformation.</b> Alternatively, if such deformations are physically applied to an IPMC strips they generate an output voltage signal (few millivolts for typical small samples) as sensors and energy harvesters. IPMCs are a type of electroactive polymer. They work very well in a liquid environment {{as well as in}} air. They have a force density of about 40 in a cantilever configuration, meaning that they can generate a tip force of almost 40 times their own weight in a cantilever mode. IPMCs in actuation,sensing and energy harvesting have a very broad bandwidth to kilo HZ and higher. IPMCs were first introduced in 1998 by Shahinpoor, Bar-Cohen, Xue, Simpson and Smith (see references below) but the original idea of ionic polymer actuators and sensors goes back to 1992-93 by Adolf, Shahinpoor, Segalman, Witkowski, Osada, Okuzaki, Hori, Doi, Matsumoto, Hirose, Oguro, Takenaka, Asaka and Kawami as depicted below: ...|$|E

In considering {{the effect of the}} first-order bending resonance on the rolling contact of wheel/rail, a new wheel/rail contact model is derived in detail in the modeling vehicle/track coupling dynamic system, in which the many intermediate coordinate systems and complex coordinate system transformations are used. The bending mode shape and its corresponding frequency of the wheelset are obtained through the modal analysis by using commercial software ANSYS. The modal superposition method is used to solve the differential equations of wheelset motion considering its flexible deformation due to the first-order bending resonance. In order to verify the present model and clarify the influence of the first-order <b>bending</b> <b>deformation</b> of wheelset on wheel/track contact behavior, a harmonic track irregularity with a fixed wavelength and a white-noise roughness are, respectively used as the excitations in the two models of vehicle-rail coupling dynamic system, one considers the effect of wheelset <b>bending</b> <b>deformation,</b> and the other does not.

We give the expressions relating the set of elastic moduli defined for one dividing surface to the corresponding set for another arbitrary dividing surface. The dividing surface with vanishing modulus of mixed deformation is defined as the neutral surface. We find the position of the neutral surface in terms of elastic moduli for any arbitrary dividing surface...|$|R

The maximum torque-induced <b>bending</b> <b>deformation</b> in ball screw systems with certain parameters is solved by modeling the ball screw as a simple Euler–Bernoulli beam. On {{the basis of the}} model, the general expression of maximum deformation of ball screw systems in terms of uncertain parameters is derived based on the second-order Taylor series expansion. Then the problem of determining bounds of the maximum deformation of uncertain systems is transformed into a series of box constrained quadratic programming problems. Box constrained quadratic programming problems are solved by difference of convex functions algorithm. The effectiveness of the analysis is validated by Monte Carlo simulation method. Through demonstration, the conclusion can be drawn that the torque-induced <b>bending</b> <b>deformation</b> in ball screw systems with uncertain-but-bounded parameters can be analyzed explicitly by the numerical method combined second-order Taylor series expansion with difference of convex functions algorithm, which offers a new approach for estimating the torque-induced <b>bending</b> <b>deformation</b> in ball screw systems...|$|E

The bio-prostheses are recorded in an artificial circulation setup and observed during the opening and closure of a systolic phase. Based on a segmentation of the orifice area, a distance signal is derived for each cusp relative to a base line given by the commissure points. This distance signal describes the static <b>bending</b> <b>deformation</b> of the cusps in one image frame.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to character skinning where divergence-free vector fields induced by skeletal motion, describe the velocity of skin deformation. The joint transformations for a pose relative to a rest pose create a <b>bend</b> <b>deformation</b> field, resulting in pose-dependent or kinematic skin deformations, varying smoothly across joints. The <b>bend</b> <b>deformation</b> parameters are interactively controlled to capture the varying deformability of bone and other anatomic tissue within an overall fold-over free and volume-preserving skin deformation. Subsequently, we represent the dynamics of skeletal motion, tissue elasticity, muscular tension and the environment as forces that are mapped to vortices at tissue interfaces. A simplified Biot-Savart law in the context of elastic deformation recovers a divergence-free velocity field from the vorticity. Finally, we apply a new stable technique to efficiently integrate points along their deformation trajectories. Adding these dynamic forces over a window of time prior to a given pose provides a continuum of user controllable kinodynamic skinning. A comprehensive implementation using a typical animator workflow in Maya shows our approach to be effective for complex character skinning...|$|R
