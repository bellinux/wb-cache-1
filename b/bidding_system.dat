5|$|Under HCI's Integrated Programme, the Sabbatical Programme {{is offered}} whereby {{students}} from Secondary 1 to 4 go on one week sabbatical courses in each {{term in the}} first semester (Terms 1 and 2). The programme is unique in allowing {{the majority of the}} school populace to put aside formal curricular lessons for a week in pursuit of their passions or interests. Sabbaticals offered are of a wide variety, in categories as defined by the school: Arts & Aesthetics, Chinese Studies, Humanities, English & Literature, Leadership, Technology, Science and Math, Camps and Student Exchange; they are essentially courses for students to opt for, such as beginner guitar and songwriting lessons, professional music production, Model United Nations training camps, football friendlies with other schools, et cetera. Also, the school requires students to use the specifically designed Online <b>Bidding</b> <b>System</b> - the i-ComP - to organise their sabbatical plans. Students who accumulate demerit points as a result of various offences are penalised in their sabbatical bidding or are recommended for corrective work order.|$|E

25|$|Edgar Kaplan (April 18, 1925 – September 7, 1997) was an American bridge {{player and}} one of the {{principal}} contributors to the game. His career spanned six decades and covered every aspect of bridge. He was a teacher, author, editor, administrator, champion player, theorist, expert Vugraph commentator, coach/captain and authority on the laws of the game. He was the editor and publisher of The Bridge World magazine for more than 30 years (1967–1997). With Alfred Sheinwold he developed the Kaplan–Sheinwold <b>bidding</b> <b>system.</b> He was from New York City.|$|E
25|$|In 1813, the Treasury had {{expenditures}} of $39 {{million and}} revenue of only $15 million. Despite anger from Congress, Gallatin {{was forced to}} reintroduce the Federalist taxes he had denounced in 1798, such as the taxes on whiskey and salt, {{as well as a}} direct tax on land and slaves. Absent a national bank and with the refusal of New England financiers to loan money for the war effort, Gallatin resorted to innovative methods to finance the war. In March 1813, he initiated the public <b>bidding</b> <b>system</b> that was to characterize subsequent government borrowings. A financial syndicate subscribed for 57% of the $16,000,000 loan, of which $5,720,000 came from New York City, $6,858,000 from Philadelphia, and $75,000 from Boston. He succeeded in funding the deficit of $69 million by bond issues and thereby paid the direct cost of the war, which amounted to $87 million. Deciding on a need for a national bank, he helped charter the Second Bank of the United States in 1816.|$|E

500|$|In January 2012, in {{preparation}} for the 2012 edition of the U.S. Open Cup, U.S. Soccer announced several changes to the tournament format. [...] Included in these changes was the introduction of a new host selection process. [...] Beginning in 2012, for all rounds of the tournament through the quarterfinals, a random host selection process would be used. While in previous years a blind <b>bidding</b> <b>system</b> was used to determine the host of a match, the new process has the host determined by blind draw if both teams' venues meet minimum standards. The blind <b>bidding</b> <b>system</b> for hosting rights remained in effect for the semifinals and final of the 2012 tournament. [...] However, U.S. Soccer announced in 2013 that hosting for all rounds of the tournament would be determined randomly as long as both venues met minimum standards.|$|E
500|$|U.S. Soccer {{was criticized}} after the {{match for the}} secretive bid process that allows teams to outspend their opponents for hosting rights. [...] Both the blind bidding process for hosting tournament matches {{and the manner in}} which MLS teams {{qualified}} for the tournament were widely criticized. [...] An example of the concerns raised around hosting came from FC Dallas midfielder Daniel Hernandez on Twitter, where he complained about Seattle's home-field advantage throughout the 2011 tournament. [...] Following the final, MLS and U.S. Soccer officials met to discuss rule changes to the tournament's host <b>bidding</b> <b>system</b> and team qualification processes. [...] Sounders FC owner Adrian Hanauer commented on the changes and the possibility of raising the profile of the tournament, [...] "I don’t think the bidding process is going to change the profile of the tournament, necessarily. It might make a few people happy, it might make a few people unhappy. But ultimately, I’m not convinced that’s what is going to raise the profile." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{a tumultuous}} time, Rainbow Hope kept {{at least part}} of the Iceland route from 1987 through late 1990. [...] In the 1987 bidding, Rainbow was the only U.S. company to bid. [...] Bids from Icelandic {{competitors}} were lower, giving them 65% of the carriage rights, while Rainbow Hope secured the remaining 35%. [...] In the 1988 bidding, the Navy changed the bidding process in a way Rainbow found unfair, and Rainbow took a new case to the Washington D.C. District Court. [...] By May 1988, the court had issued a preliminary injunction halting the bidding process and ordering carriage be continued under the terms of the 1987 contracts. [...] In November 1988, the court granted a summary judgement for Rainbow, finding the new <b>bidding</b> <b>system</b> illegal. [...] This judgement held for nearly two years, but was ultimately overturned on 24 August 1990, when a panel of Judges Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Douglas H. Ginsburg and David B. Sentelle of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Washington D.C. Circuit, reversed the lower court's decision.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{constrained}} <b>bid</b> <b>system</b> {{players are}} forced to bid a certain fraction of their current points.

500|$|Despite the {{negotiation}} difficulties, the Boston Red Sox eventually signed Matsuzaka. The team paid approximately $103.1million in total, including the transfer fee and contract, {{to acquire the}} pitcher. Kurkjian believes that with fees and contracts this high, small-market teams {{could not afford to}} compete with large-market teams for the rights to negotiate with some posted Japanese players. Kurkjian blames the posting system's use of a blind <b>bidding</b> <b>system</b> as the cause of Matsuzaka's [...] "outrageous offer." [...] He also postulates that Matsuzaka's high bid amount helped to inflate the bids for Kei Igawa who was posted two weeks later, perpetuating the problem further. After winning {{the negotiation}} rights to Igawa, Yankees' general manager Brian Cashman told reporters that [...] "the posting system, clearly with what took place this winter, might not necessarily be the best system". Kurkjian claims that other MLB executives already believe that a traditional free agent structure, where the highest bidder wins, would be better than the current system. Cashman and Yankees team president Randy Levine met with NPB team officials in early 2007 to discuss the posting system, among other things. These meetings did not result in any immediate changes.|$|E
2500|$|Reese {{contributed to}} the Acol <b>bidding</b> <b>system</b> [...] {{originally}} developed by Maurice Harrison-Gray, Jack Marx and S.J.("Skid") Simon in the late 1920s and early 1930s and co-authored the first textbook on it with Ben Cohen in 1938. Named after the Acol Bridge Club in North London (located on Acol Road at the time), it became the prevailing <b>bidding</b> <b>system</b> in Britain and some {{other parts of the}} world. The book and its subsequent editions in 1939, 1946 and 1949 gave unity to what was otherwise a rather free-wheeling <b>bidding</b> <b>system.</b> His later adaptation of Garozzo and Yallouze's book on the Blue Club and his book on the Precision Club were widely used by devotees of strong club systems, and by their opponents as references.|$|E
2500|$|As a theorist, Kaplan {{developed}} the Kaplan-Sheinwold <b>bidding</b> <b>system,</b> which heavily influenced Standard American bidding (apart from Standard's {{use of the}} strong no trump) from the 1970s on: for example, much of the Precision <b>bidding</b> <b>system</b> as originally formulated was based directly on Kaplan-Sheinwold. As Jeff Rubens noted in his remembrance of Kaplan, “The foundation of Kaplan-Sheinwold is more a blending of ostensibly eclectic elements into a coherent whole than a sparkling new concept, but Edgar combined the ingredients cleverly and added some finishing touches of his own.” ...|$|E

In domestic bridge he was a leading organiser. He {{had been a member of}} Almacks club since 1901, and later was a co-founder and Chairman of two leading London card clubs – Crockford's (in St James's Street) and the Hamilton Club (in Hamilton Place). He was also a leading player in the 1930s, winning the Gold Cup in 1933, and playing in several international events.
