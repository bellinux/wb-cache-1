5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for very small insects such as thrips is the {{possibility}} of being trapped <b>by</b> <b>water.</b> Thrips have non-wetting bodies and have the ability to ascend a meniscus by arching their bodies and working their way head-first and upwards along the water surface in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|Although {{social order}} was {{maintained}} throughout the plague years, {{the economy of}} the region was devastated. However, the surviving merchant community were very influential in the city and, {{in the wake of the}} catastrophe, set about increasing the council's influence around the market, buying many of the surrounding shops. The council also bought a set of wharves along King Street near Dragon Hall in 1397 and decreed that all goods entering Norwich <b>by</b> <b>water</b> be unloaded there. This ensured almost complete control of Norwich trade by the merchants who now dominated the council.|$|E

5|$|As the Brazilian {{army was}} ready for combat, Caxias sought to {{encircle}} Humaitá and force its capitulation by siege. To aid the operation, he used observation balloons to gather information of the enemy lines. The combined Brazilian–Argentine–Uruguayan army advanced through hostile territory to surround Humaitá. By 2 November, Humaitá was completely cut off from land reinforcement by Paraguayan forces. On 19 February 1868, Brazilian ironclads successfully made a passage up the Paraguay River under heavy fire, gaining full control {{of the river and}} isolating Humaitá from resupply <b>by</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, thorium is slowly attacked <b>by</b> <b>water,</b> {{but does not}} readily dissolve in most common acids, {{with the exception of}} hydrochloric acid, where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of ThO(OH,Cl)H. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions; if these are not present, passivation can occur, as with uranium and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Balch was {{a member}} of caving clubs such as the Wessex Cave Club. He was a serious speleologist and often made ten-hour trips wearing cloth cap, old suit and tie. Balch Cave near Stoke St Michael is named after him.

5|$|Catalytic triads perform {{covalent}} catalysis via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate {{is resolved}} <b>by</b> <b>water,</b> {{the result is}} hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a transferase. For example, attack by an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds are {{naturally}} lipophilic and hydrophobic, {{which means the}} diamonds' surface cannot be wet <b>by</b> <b>water,</b> but can be easily wet and stuck by oil. This property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds. However, when diamond surfaces are chemically modified with certain ions, {{they are expected to}} become so hydrophilic that they can stabilize multiple layers of water ice at human body temperature.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters {{from the}} Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), {{at that time}} a {{volunteer}} organization, arrived {{under the command of}} Chief Engineer Cornelius Anderson. As the fire grew, the FDNY personnel were joined by retired fire chiefs from the city and firefighting crews from Brooklyn, Newark, and Williamsburg. Firemen battling the blaze were aided <b>by</b> <b>water</b> flowing from the Croton Aqueduct, which had been completed in 1842. The fire either weakened in intensity or had been subdued by firefighters by 1:00 p.m. that day.|$|E

5|$|Fishing {{industry}} is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded <b>by</b> <b>water</b> on all sides. The fishing grounds of Romblon are a migratory path of fish from Sulu and Visayan Seas passing Tablas Strait, Sibuyan Sea and Romblon Pass.

5|$|Like many powders, {{dysprosium}} powder {{may present}} an explosion hazard when {{mixed with air}} and when an ignition source is present. Thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by static electricity. Dysprosium fires cannot be put out <b>by</b> <b>water.</b> It can react with water to produce flammable hydrogen gas. Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be extinguished with water, while dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non-flammable. Dysprosium nitrate, Dy(NO3)3, is a strong oxidizing agent and will readily ignite on contact with organic substances.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, {{atmosphere}} performers {{have disappeared}} from most {{sections of the}} park, including Medieval Faire. Two entertainment areas have remained constant in the section, a proscenium theatre and a stunt and acrobatic space surrounded <b>by</b> <b>water.</b> Currently named Wonderland Theatre, the indoor facility has hosted a variety of stage show revues, ice shows, and now an acrobatic production, Cirque Ambiente. A structure within Arthur's Baye initially featured a pirate diving and acrobatics show, which has changed now {{to have a more}} generic theme; it is currently branded Kinet–X.|$|E
5|$|Overall, high {{temperature}} {{is the most}} common problem in the Little Butte Creek watershed. This is most likely caused <b>by</b> <b>water</b> diversion and depleted riparian zones. Approximately 53percent of riparian zones in the watershed are damaged due to agriculture or deforestation, while 43percent are classified as healthy. Another threat to healthy riparian zones are invasive blackberries, which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue.|$|E
