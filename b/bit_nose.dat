Thus, it can be seen that: rock stress is mainly concentrated on the drill <b>bit</b> <b>nose</b> area, extending from the <b>bit</b> <b>nose</b> area to the both sides of the nose, the rock stress diminishes gradually. This change rule is similar to the wear regularity of the bit (Han Laiju et al. 1992; Ai 2006), which proves the correctness of the above finite material model and computational model, and per revolution-specific rock-breaking work a can be used to reflect the rock breaking effect.|$|E

Bill Yancey, another teammate of Marcelle's, said, [...] "What got Marcelle out of baseball, he and teammate Frank Warfield had a fight in Cuba {{in the winter of}} 1927-28, over a dice game and Warfield <b>bit</b> his <b>nose</b> off. He was a proud, handsome guy, you know, and then he used to wear a black patch across his nose and he got so he couldn't play baseball anymore."

50|$|The tiger sprang onto Atlas, who now staggered. It <b>bit</b> Atlas' <b>nose,</b> {{then tried}} to bite Atlas' throat. However, the mane saved Atlas' neck, so the tiger's bite did not suffocate Atlas. Instead, as they {{wrestled}} much, the tiger managed to get hair in its mouth, and the hair interfered with the tiger's respiration, so it had to release its hold on Atlas, allowing Atlas to deliver a massive left uppercut. The uppercut caused the tiger to stumble to about 20.0 ft away.|$|R

At the age of nine, calling himself [...] "a little Huguenot," [...] he refused to attend Mass, sang Protestant psalms to his sister Margaret (exhorting her all the while to change her religion and cast her Book of Hours into the fire), and even <b>bit</b> the <b>nose</b> off a statue of Saint Paul. His mother firmly cautioned her children against such behaviour, and he would never again show any Protestant tendencies. Instead, he became nominally Roman Catholic.|$|R

However, Harchester manager Stuart Naysmith came up with a solution - Sign Vivian Wright, a talented goalkeeper currently not playing for anyone. The problem? No-one really wanted to play with Viv following an incident in the middle of a game where Viv <b>bit</b> the <b>nose</b> of an opposing player.|$|R

Fifita stated, [...] "Yeah. It was in Baltimore Airport. There was a hotel there. We were staying at another hotel - the Marriott or something. There was another hotel there, though. It was hopping at the time. The music was playing and it was packed. It was during the week I believe. Me and Siva Afi went over and there were lots of babyfaces there at the bar. So we went and sat in the other corner away from them. When they were ready to close, we had a few drinks, and on our way out there were five guys just sitting there. Of course, the same thing came out. The 'fake' stuff. 'Hey, are you guys with those guys - wrestlers? The fake wrestlers on TV?' You know. I said, 'Yeah. I'll show you.' And I reached over without {{thinking}} - there are four other guys there (laughs) - grabbed his face, and <b>bit</b> his <b>nose</b> off. Then the fight started. Me and Siva kind of cleaned house there and left. I'll never forget it (laughs)." ...|$|R
50|$|Cats {{are highly}} {{territorial}} and secreting odors {{plays a major}} role in cat communication. The nose helps cats to identify territories, other cats and mates, to locate food, and for various other causes. A cat's sense of smell is believed to be about fourteen times stronger than that of humans. The rhinarium (the leathery <b>bit</b> of <b>nose</b> we see) is quite tough to allow it to absorb rather rough treatment sometimes. The color varies according to the genotype (genetic makeup) of the cat. Cat's skin has the same color as the fur but the color of the nose leather is probably dictated by a dedicated gene. Cats with white fur have skin susceptible to damage by ultraviolet light that may cause cancer. Extra care is required when outside in hot sun.|$|R

50|$|After his release, Bulger {{worked as}} a janitor and {{construction}} worker before becoming a bookmaker and loan shark with ties to Donald Killeen, {{the leader of the}} dominant mob in South Boston. In 1971, Killeen's younger brother allegedly <b>bit</b> off the <b>nose</b> of Michael Dwyer, a member of the rival Mullen Gang. A gang war soon resulted, leading to a string of killings throughout Boston and the surrounding suburbs. The Killeens quickly found themselves outgunned and outmaneuvered by the younger Mullens. It was during the Killeen-Mullen war that Bulger committed what Kevin Weeks describes as his first murder.|$|R

A gangland war soon resulted, leading to a string of slayings throughout Boston and the surrounding suburbs.|$|R
50|$|Gardner {{was always}} in the {{newspapers}} usually for barroom brawls. He beat several men in a brawl in 1852 at the Oyster Saloon, escaping the police. The New York Times called him 'Mr. Awful Gardner' after having <b>bit</b> another pugilist's <b>nose</b> or ear off after an argument in 1853 (later setting up a prize fight with the other boxer). Gardner fled to Canada after being charged with assault but returned in 1854 after his son drowned. Gardner spent time in jail and in 1855 he was convicted of assault and battery in another case. He was sentenced to six months in the Sing Sing Prison, being released in 1856, but he would return.|$|R
60|$|They plodded days upon {{days and}} without end over the soft, {{unpacked}} snow. It was hard, monotonous work, {{with none of}} the joy and blood-stir that went with flying over hard surface. Now one man to the fore in the snowshoes, and now the other, {{it was a case of}} stubborn, unmitigated plod. A yard of powdery snow had to be pressed down, and the wide-webbed shoe, under a man's weight, sank a full dozen inches into the soft surface. Snowshoe work, under such conditions, called for the use of muscles other than those used in ordinary walking. From step to step the rising foot could not come up and forward on a slant. It had to be raised perpendicularly. When the snowshoe was pressed into the snow, its nose was confronted by a vertical wall of snow twelve inches high. If the foot, in rising, slanted forward the slightest <b>bit,</b> the <b>nose</b> of the shoe penetrated the obstructing wall and tipped downward till the heel of the shoe struck the man's leg behind. Thus up, straight up, twelve inches, each foot must be raised every time and all the time, ere the forward swing from the knee could begin.|$|R
50|$|Hit men Tom and Jerry wait in a Chicago bar for {{the go-ahead}} to kill Stanley. Anxious {{to get the}} hit done, Jerry {{suggests}} they perform the hit immediately; Tom refuses, and Stanley entertains them with jokes. As the phone rings, the film shifts to a flashback set ten years earlier, in 1984. Jerry, a youth employed at Billy's used car dealership, joins Tom as he walks with Karl. Karl describes how a local gangster <b>bit</b> off the <b>nose</b> of Karl's nephew. Disturbed by the audaciousness and brutality of the attack, Tom promises {{to look into the}} issue. However, Karl becomes spooked when they enter Tom's car, and Karl begins bargaining with Tom, to Jerry's confusion. Tom agrees that the two are friends with a long history but strangles Karl after an apology. Jerry throws up but insists that he is otherwise fine.|$|R
5000|$|Butler to Commander Vimes and Lady Sibyl, Willikins was in {{his youth}} {{a member of the}} Shamlegger Street Rude Boys street gang (whose skills at street {{violence}} were respected even by Sam Vimes) where his weapon of choice was a cap brim sewn with sharpened pennies. In Night Watch it is revealed that he has been {{in the service of the}} Ramkin family for most of his life. His only absence from this employment was during the events in Jingo when he joined the army during the war against Klatch, during which he was known to alternate between violently yelling at his men for showing disrespect and then politely apologising to Vimes for their actions. It is implied, and almost certainly true, that he <b>bit</b> a man's <b>nose</b> off during the same war. Willikins' exaggerated deference and circumlocutory manner of speech strongly echo the character Jeeves created by P G Wodehouse ...|$|R

I'd have overlooked his ignorance, poor old gentleman, {{if he would}} not have gone and spoken of my O as vulgar. Vulgar! So when I began to tell him how it began from Tigearnach, the O'More of Ballymakilty, that was Tanist of Connaught, in the time of King Mac Murrough, and that killed Phadrig the O'Donoghoe in single combat at the fight of Shoch-knockmorty, and <b>bit</b> off his <b>nose,</b> calling it a sweet morsel of revenge, what does he do but tell me I was mad, and that he would have none of my nonsensical tales of the savage Irish. So I said I couldn't stand to hear my family insulted, and then--would you believe it? he would have it that it was I that was insolent, and when I was not going to apologize for what I had borne from him, he said he had always known how it would be trying to deal with one of our family, no better than making a silk purse out of a sow's ear. [...] "And I'm obliged for the compliment," [...] said I, quite coolly and politely, [...] "but no Irish pig would sell his ear for a purse;" [...] and so I came away, quite civilly and reasonably. Aye, I see what you would do, Mr. Kendal, but I beg with all my heart you won't. There are some things a gentleman should not put up with, and I'll not take it well of you if you call it my duty to hear my father and his family abused. I'll despise myself if I could. You don't--' cried he, turning round to Albinia.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} met with {{generally}} positive reviews. Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 76% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 218 reviews, with an average score of 6.6/10. The critical consensus is: [...] "Delivered with typically stately precision from director Clint Eastwood, Invictus may not be rousing enough for some viewers, but Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman inhabit their real-life characters with admirable conviction."Critic David Ansen wrote:Anthony Peckhams sturdy, functional screenplay, based on John Carlins book Playing the Enemy, can be a <b>bit</b> on the <b>nose</b> (and the message songs Eastwood adds are overkill). Yet the lapses fade {{in the face of}} such a soul-stirring story — one that would be hard to believe if it were fiction. The wonder of Invictus is that it actually went down this way.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars and wrote:It is a very good film. It has moments evoking great emotion, as when the black and white members of the presidential security detail (hard-line ANC activists and Afrikaner cops) agree with excruciating difficulty to serve together. And when Damons character — François Pienaar, as the team captain — is shown the cell where Mandela was held for those long years on Robben Island. My wife, Chaz, and I were taken to the island early one morning by Ahmed Kathrada, one of Mandelas fellow prisoners, and yes, the movie shows his very cell, with the thin blankets on the floor. You regard that cell and you think, here a great man waited in faith for his rendezvous with history.Shave Magazines Jake Tomlinson wrote:Eastwoods film shows how sport can unify people, a straightforward and moving message that leaves audiences cheering. The sports, accurate portrayal and the solid storyline earn this movie a manliness rating of 3/5. However, the entertainment value, historical accuracy and strong message this movie delivers earn it an overall rating of 4.5 stars. Definitely, worth seeing.Varietys Todd McCarthy wrote:Inspirational on the face of it, Clint Eastwoods film has a predictable trajectory, but every scene brims with surprising details that accumulate into a rich fabric of history, cultural impressions and emotion.|$|R
