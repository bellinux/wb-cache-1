5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{emotional}} distractions, {{during the summer of}} 1910 Mahler worked on his Tenth Symphony, completing the Adagio and drafting four more movements. He and Alma returned to New York in late October 1910, where Mahler threw himself into a busy Philharmonic season of concerts and tours. Around Christmas 1910 he began suffering from a sore throat, which persisted. On 21 February 1911, with a temperature of 40°C (104°F), Mahler insisted on fulfilling an engagement at Carnegie Hall, with a program of mainly new Italian music, including the world premiere of Busoni's Berceuse élégiaque. This was Mahler's last concert. After weeks confined to bed he was diagnosed with <b>bacterial</b> <b>endocarditis,</b> a disease to which sufferers from defective heart valves were particularly prone, and for which the survival rate in pre-antibiotic days was almost zero. Mahler did not give up hope; he talked of resuming the concert season, and took a keen interest when one of Alma's compositions was sung at a public recital by the soprano Frances Alda, on 3 March. On 8 April the Mahler family and a permanent nurse left New York on board SS Amerika bound for Europe. They reached Paris ten days later, where Mahler entered a clinic at Neuilly, but there was no improvement; on 11 May he was taken by train to the Löw sanatorium in Vienna, where he died on 18 May.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat), certain Streptococcus species {{are responsible for}} many cases of pink eye, meningitis, <b>bacterial</b> pneumonia, <b>endocarditis,</b> erysipelas, and necrotizing fasciitis (the 'flesh-eating' bacterial infections). However, many streptococcal species are not pathogenic, and form part of the commensal human microbiota of the mouth, skin, intestine, and upper respiratory tract. Furthermore, streptococci are a necessary ingredient in producing Emmentaler ("Swiss") cheese.|$|R
25|$|Many {{microorganisms}} {{can cause}} infective endocarditis. These are generally isolated by blood culture, where the patient's blood is removed, and any growth is noted and identified. The term <b>bacterial</b> <b>endocarditis</b> (BE) commonly is used, reflecting {{the fact that}} most cases of IE are due to bacteria; however, infective endocarditis (IE) has become the preferred term.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also used}} to prevent <b>bacterial</b> <b>endocarditis</b> in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent Streptococcus pneumoniae and other {{encapsulated}} bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax. The United Kingdom recommends against its use for infectious endocarditis prophylaxis. These recommendations do not appear to have changed the rates of infection for infectious endocarditis.|$|E

30|$|Introduction Early {{surgical}} {{intervention in}} <b>bacterial</b> infective <b>endocarditis</b> seems to increase survival compared with conservative management or delayed surgery [1]. However, {{in order to}} decrease the bacterial inoculum on valves, European society of cardiology guidelines suggest, in cases without emergency, to postpone surgery to allow 1 or 2  weeks of antibiotic treatment [2]. We looked for valve culture in a population of endocarditis {{in intensive care unit}} and we aimed to identify associated factor for positive valve culture and to study outcomes of those patients.|$|R
40|$|Antibiotic {{prophylaxis}} can {{be given}} to prevent surgical site infection or to avoid <b>bacterial</b> infective <b>endocarditis</b> and prosthetic joint infections {{as a result of}} bacteremia following surgery. Although prophylactic antibiotics are rarely warranted for clean dermatologic surgery, there is increasing support in the literature for their judicious use for selected high-risk cases. This article discusses the host co-morbidities, wound characteristics, body sites, and complex surgical procedures associated with increased dermatologic surgical site infection and goes on to review the evidence for and against antibiotic prophylaxis in its various forms. Updated guidelines for prevention of infective endocarditis and prosthetic joint infection following dermatologic surgery are also outlined...|$|R

40|$|Streptococcus sanguinis is {{a leading}} cause of infective <b>endocarditis.</b> <b>Bacterial</b> {{adhesion}} to platelets is likely important in the pathogenesis of infective <b>endocarditis.</b> <b>Bacterial</b> cell wall-anchored (Cwa) proteins may mediate this adhesion. To begin to test this hypothesis, S. sanguinis adhesion to platelets was examined in vitro. The requirement of 12 Cwa proteins for S. sanguinis-platelet adhesion was individually assessed, measuring adhesion of purified platelets to polystyrene wells coated with S. sanguinis strain SK 36 or 12 isogenic Cwa protein mutants. Significantly fewer platelets adhered to wells coated with one mutant strain, VT 1614. However, results of a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that 8 mutants, including VT 1614, adhered in significantly lower numbers to wells than did SK 36. After accounting for unequal bacterial numbers, we determined {{there was no significant difference}} in platelet adhesion among the strains. This suggests that none of the Cwa proteins examined were required for S. sanguinis-platelet adhesion...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze a PCR based {{approach}} for detection of infective endocarditis in Azerbaijan. Methods: Ten aortic valves, 8 mitral valves and 2 tricuspid valves, were analyzed for the presence of <b>bacterial</b> infective <b>endocarditis</b> using Gram staining, culture and PCR methods. Results: Of the 20 valves, 5 and 4 cases were positive by Gram staining and culture assay, respectively. Bacterial DNA was positive in 12 of the 20 valves (60 %) by broad-spectrum PCR. Direct sequencing for species identification was possible in 10 cases. Conclusion: PCR and direct molecular identification of the etiological agents responsible for infective endocarditis may enable specific treatment to begin at an earlier phase of the disease...|$|R

30|$|Surgical {{indications}} {{and appropriate}} timing for surgery for NBTE {{have not been}} formally studied. In general, surgical indications for NBTE {{are the same as}} for infectious endocarditis and include uncontrollable heart failure or infection and mobile vegetations. In the present case, patient was relatively stable and TEE showed mobile vegetations which could cause stroke; emergent open-heart surgery was warranted. Although open-heart surgery might be waved because of systemic condition related to the malignancy, open-heart surgery should be performed as soon as possible when they are stable enough to underwent surgery and meet one of surgical indications listed above. Preservation of the valve might be possible in more cases of NBTE in which the valve is structurally and functionally normal after the vegetation is removed than that of <b>bacterial</b> infectious <b>endocarditis.</b>|$|R

30|$|Half of DCT {{patients}} had basilar artery dilatation, an unusual finding in bacterial meningitis {{that was not}} observed in the non-DCT cases. The fusiform basilar artery dilatation {{in the course of}} bacterial meningitis found in two DCT cases is consistent with the diagnosis of infectious intracranial aneurysm, also known as mycotic aneurysm [20]. Infectious intracranial aneurysms are rare, localized, cerebrovascular lesions that make up 0.7 – 5.4 % of all intracranial aneurysms [21]. The majority of cases (65 %) occur in the context of <b>bacterial</b> infectious <b>endocarditis,</b> and meningitis is estimated to be the cause of 5 % of infectious intracranial aneurysms [20]. There are few case reports of infectious intracranial aneurysms in pneumococcal meningitis which describe both saccular and fusiform aneurysms [22, 23]. One of our DCT cases showed thrombosis in the basilar aneurysm and its branches which caused the infarction. The origin of the thrombosis cannot be traced, but an embolus or even spontaneous thrombosis of intracranial aneurysm could be suspected [24], especially in the setting of vascular inflammation [25].|$|R
