5|$|GoldenEye was {{the second}} and final Bond film to <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> a novel by novelist John Gardner. The book closely follows the film's storyline, but Gardner added a violent {{sequence}} prior to the opening bungee jump in which Bond kills a group of Russian guards, a change that the video game GoldenEye 007 retained.|$|E
5|$|Armies facing {{service in}} {{different}} theatres may need several different camouflage uniforms. Separate issues of temperate/jungle and desert camouflage uniforms are common. Patterns can {{to some extent}} <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> different terrains by adding means of fastening pieces of vegetation to the uniform. Helmets often have netting covers; some jackets have small loops for the same purpose. Being able to find appropriate camouflage vegetation or in other ways modify the issued battle uniform to suit the local terrain is an important skill for infantry soldiers.|$|E
50|$|The Eldar pine {{is treated}} as a species (Pinus eldarica) by some authors; it <b>is</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> a drier climate with a summer {{rainfall}} peak, whereas subsp. brutia <b>is</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> a climate with mainly winter rainfall.|$|R

5|$|The Soviets {{bought an}} example of, and plans for, the {{machinery}} of the later Duca d'Aosta-class cruisers and had some difficulty in adapting the smaller hull for the larger and more-powerful machinery, {{so much so that}} it delayed the start of construction. Another problem was that the Italian design had to <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> use the Soviet preference for a mix of longitudinal framing for the hull framing amidships and transverse framing for the ends, while also reinforcing the hull structure to withstand the more-severe weather conditions that the Soviets commonly encountered.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{idea for}} a video game that {{presented}} the Metroid series in a pinball setting came to Kensuke Tanabe after he learned that Fuse Games had previously worked on Mario Pinball Land, another pinball video game. Recalling that the series' protagonist, Samus, can morph into a ball, Tanabe {{was convinced that the}} Metroid universe could <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> a pinball setting. The game was sold with a Rumble Pak accessory for the Nintendo DS, marking the first time the accessory was available for the Nintendo DS.|$|E
5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} {{a method of}} using a rapidly rotating mirror to study transient phenomena, and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an electric spark. He communicated to Fran√ßois Arago the idea that his method could <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> {{a study of the}} speed of light. Arago expanded upon Wheatstone's concept in an 1838 publication, emphasizing the possibility that a test of the relative speed of light in air versus water could be used to distinguish between the particle and wave theories of light.|$|E
5|$|The Old Poor Law was {{a parish}} based system, there were around 15,000 such parishes {{based upon the}} area around a parish church. The system allowed for despotic {{behavior}} from the Overseers of the Poor but as Overseers of the Poor would know their paupers they were considered able to differentiate between the deserving and undeserving poor making the system both more humane and initially more efficient. The Elizabethan Poor Law operated {{at a time when}} the population was small enough for everyone to know everyone else, therefore people's circumstances would be known and the idle poor would be unable to claim on the parishes' poor rate. The system provided social stability yet by 1750 needed to <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> cope with population increases, greater mobility and regional price variations.|$|E
5|$|The keel of Yamato, {{the lead}} ship of the class, was laid {{down at the}} Kure Naval Arsenal, Hiroshima, on 4 November 1937, in a {{dockyard}} that had to <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> accommodate her enormous hull. The dock was deepened by one meter, and gantry cranes capable of lifting up to 350 tonnes were installed. Extreme secrecy was maintained throughout construction, a canopy even being erected over part of the drydock to screen the ship from view. Yamato was launched on 8 August 1940, with Captain (later Vice-Admiral) Miyazato Shutoku in command. A great effort was made in Japan {{to ensure that the}} ships were built in extreme secrecy to prevent American intelligence officials from learning of their existence and specifications.|$|E

5|$|Entertainment {{is a form}} of {{activity}} that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but {{is more likely to be}} one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.|$|E
5|$|Flex-fuel hybrid {{electric}} and flex-fuel plug-in hybrid {{are two types}} of hybrid vehicles built with a combustion engine capable of running on gasoline, E-85, or E-100 to help drive the wheels in conjunction with the electric engine or to recharge the battery pack that powers the electric engine. In 2007 Ford produced 20 demonstration Escape Hybrid E85s for real-world testing in fleets in the U.S. Also as a demonstration project, Ford delivered in 2008 the first flexible-fuel plug-in hybrid SUV to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), a Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid, which runs on gasoline or E85. GM announced that the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, launched in the U.S. in late 2010, would be the first commercially available flex-fuel plug-in capable of adapting the propulsion to several world markets such as the U.S., Brazil or Sweden, as the combustion engine can <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> run on E85, E100 or diesel respectively. The Volt was initially expected to be flex-fuel-capable in 2013. Lotus Engineering unveiled the Lotus CityCar at the 2010 Paris Motor Show. The CityCar is a plug-in hybrid concept car designed for flex-fuel operation on ethanol, or methanol as well as regular gasoline.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{shifting}} interferometry overcomes {{these limitations}} by not relying on finding fringe centers, {{but rather by}} collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig.17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency. The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase shifting technology has been adapted {{to a variety of}} interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach‚ÄìZehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase shifting techniques can <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle interferometry.|$|E

5|$|The 1994 Imola layout, {{which had}} been in place since 1981, was never again used for a Formula One race. The circuit was heavily {{modified}} following the race, including a change at Tamburello‚Äîalso the scene of major accidents for Gerhard Berger (1989) and Nelson Piquet (1987)‚Äîfrom a high speed corner to a much slower chicane. The FIA also changed the regulations governing Formula One car design, {{to the extent that}} the 1995 regulations required all teams to create completely new designs, as their 1994 cars could not <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> them. The concern raised at the drivers briefing the morning of the race, by Senna and Berger, would lead to the Grand Prix Drivers' Association reforming at the following race, the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix. The GPDA, which was founded in 1961, had previously disbanded in 1982. The primary purpose of it reforming was to allow drivers to discuss safety issues with a view to improve standards following the incidents at Imola. The front two grid slots at the Monaco Grand Prix that year, which were painted with Brazilian and Austrian flags, were left clear in memory of the two drivers who had lost their lives, while both Williams and Simtek entered only one car each. Additionally, a minute of silence was observed before the race.|$|E
