This is manufactured by dispersing long strands (usually >1”) of chopped fiber (commonly glass fibers or carbon fibers on a bath of thermoset resin (commonly polyester resin, vinyl ester or epoxy resin)).

Wall panels fabricated from polyester resins reinforced with fiberglass [...] so-called fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) [...] are typically used in restaurants, kitchens, restrooms and other areas that require washable low-maintenance walls. Departments of Transportation in the USA also specify them for use as overlays on roads and bridges. They are known as PCO Polyester Concrete Overlays.

40|$|Continuous caster moulds are {{the last}} and most {{important}} stage in the steelmaking process, where inclusions can either be generated or removed. With increasing casting speed using conventional immersion nozzles critical problems, such as unstable <b>bulk</b> <b>mould</b> flow have been noticed. Mould flux entrapment due to vortex and shearing action from the oscillating surface waves have become of particular concern. It is therefore necessary to have a calm inlet flow {{at the entrance of}} the mould. Recently, it has been acknowledged that a swirl blade placed at the upstream of the immersion nozzle effectively resolves the problems arising from unstable <b>bulk</b> <b>mould</b> flow. Therefore, to increase the knowledge of effect of swirling flow on the flow pattern in the mould, fundamental mathematical models of a billet mould equipped with a swirl blade in the nozzle have been developed. The model was used to study the effect of divergent angle of the immersion nozzle and mould aspect ratio on the flow field and temperature distribution inside billets moulds. Data from water model experiments were used to verify the mathematical model predictions. A fairly good agreement was found between physical modeling data and predictions, which ensured that the numerical model is reliable. Thereafter, the differences between square and round billet moulds were studied. Next, the effect of changing aspect ratio of the rectangular mould on the fluid flow and heat transfer, while keeping mould surface area constant, was studied. Two types of immersion nozzles, bottomless and conventional, were also analyzed during the research. The model moulds were changed gradually from a square billet with an aspect ratio of 1 x 1 to a rectangular billet with an aspect ratio of 3 x 1. First, the temperature and velocity distributions were calculated. Later, unsteady calculations were done to determine velocity fluctuations on the meniscus level for two types of nozzles and several moulds geometries. QC 20101110 </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to produce {{isotactic}} polypropylene based composites filled with waste thermosetting <b>bulk</b> <b>moulded</b> composite (BMC). The influence of BMC waste addition (5, 10, 20 wt%) on composites structure and properties was investigated. Moreover, additional studies of chemical treatment of the filler were prepared. Modification of BMC waste by calcium stearate (CaSt) powder allows to assess the possibility of the production of composites with better dispersion of the filler and more uniform properties. The mechanical, processing, and thermal properties, as well as structural investigations were examined by means of static tensile test, Dynstat impact strength test, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), melt flow index (MFI) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Developed composites with different amounts of non-reactive filler exhibited satisfactory thermal and mechanical properties. Moreover, application of the low cost modifier (CaSt) allows to obtain composites with better dispersion of the filler and improved processability...|$|R

40|$|For powder {{injection}} moulding (PIM) the ceramic powder {{is mixed with}} a thermoplastic binder system to achieve an injectable feedstock. In contrast to {{injection moulding}} of polymeric components, the binder must be removed after the shaping step before sintering the ceramic part to full density. During the mould filling process shear forces act on the blend that might cause separations of powder particles and binder. In this case polymer films form at the mould surface and at internal interfaces which induce microstructural defects in the debinded part. In particular for multi-component parts this effect is critical since binder films in the joining zone weaken the bonding strength between the two components that might even lead to delamination. For detecting binder separations within the injection <b>moulded</b> <b>bulk</b> material and at joining zones of two-component parts the microstructure of green samples has been studied. Since conventional machining techniques like grinding and polishing modify the original structure, e. g. when particles are {{pulled out of the}} matrix and binder smears onto the surface, a special ceramographic method for the preparation of cross-sections was applied. This approach bases on broad ion beam techniques and enables the simultaneous polishing of hard ceramic particles and soft polymer molecules without destroying the structure or producing a relief at the surface. In the analysed samples binder accumulations were found along flow lines, at weld lines, at boundaries of so-called dead water regions and at the interface of two-component parts...|$|R
40|$|URL] of {{the present}} {{challenges}} in polymer sca!old processing is the fabrication of three-dimensional (3 D) architectures with an adequate mechanical performance {{to be used in}} the tissue engineering of hard tissues. This paper describes a preliminary study on the development of a new method to produce biodegradable sca!olds from a range of corn-starch-based polymers. In some cases, hydroxlapatite was also used as a einforcement of the biodegradable polymers. The developed methodology consists of a standard conventional injection moulding process, on which a solid blowing agent based on carboxylic acids is used to generate the foaming of the <b>bulk</b> of the <b>moulded</b> part. The proposed route allows for the production of sca!olds with a compact skin and a porous core, with promising mechanical properties. By using the developed method it is possible to manufacture biodegradable polymer sca!olds in an easy (melt-based processing) and reproducible manner. The sca!olds can be moulded into complex shapes, and the blowing additives do not a!ect the non-cytotoxic behaviour of the starch-based materials. The materials produced using this method were evaluated with respect to the morphology of the porous structure, and the respective mechanical properties and degradation behaviour. It was demonstrated that it is possible to obtain, by a standard melt based processing route, 3 D sca!olds with complex shapes that exhibit an appropriate morphology, without decreasing signi"cantly the mechanical properties of the materials. It is believed that the optimisation of the proposed processing methodology may lead to the production of sca!olds that might be used on the regeneration of load-bearing tissues...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — An {{original}} {{approach to}} compute the longitudinal tensile break stress of multiphase composite materials with short fibers reinforcement is presented. The most obvious mechanical model which reflects a multiphase composite material is a pre-impregnated material, known as prepreg. We may include in this class of prepregs, Sheet- and <b>Bulk</b> <b>Moulding</b> Compounds. The model is seen as consisting of three phase compounds: resin, filler and fibers, model that is reduced to two phase compounds: substitute matrix and fibers. The Sheet Moulding Compounds reinforced with discontinuous and almost parallel fibers, subjected to longitudinal tensile loads, presents a specific note by {{the existence of a}} shear mechanism between fibers and matrix. This shear mechanism transfers the tensile load through the fibers. The Young’s moduli for the substitute matrix and for the entire composite are computed and a comparison between the theoretical approach and the experimental data is accomplished...|$|E

Flax fiber/polypropylene compounds were prepared in a co-rotating twin screw extruder using maleic acid anhydride/polypropylene copolymers as a coupling agent. The tensile strength is increased up to 170 % compared to the pure matrix material. Mechanical properties of flax fiber reinforced BMC (a thermosetting <b>Bulk</b> <b>Moulding</b> Compound) processed by injection moulding are {{comparable to those of}} glass fibre reinforced BMC. Because of the high polarity of its surface the flax fiber shows a strong adhesion to polyurethanes. So flax fibers can simply be processed to reinforced foam using the structural Reaction Injection Moulding technique.

40|$|There is an {{emerging}} {{interest in the}} aerospace industry to manufacture composite components with intricate geometries. One {{way to do this}} is by using a <b>bulk</b> <b>moulding</b> compound which consists of strands of unidirectional carbon-fibre tape. This material system is termed randomly-oriented strand (ROS) composites. The great design potential of ROS composites has been demonstrated in the literature, but the modelling techniques for this material are in their infancy. This paper proposes a stochastic 2 D modelling technique for predicting strength of ROS composites from the mechanical properties of the individual strands. This model is representative of the microstructure and the through-the-thickness fracture morphologies characteristic to ROS composites. Classical laminate theory and Hashin's criteria are used to predict strand breakage, while interlaminar strength and fracture toughness are implemented to account for strand debonding. The model successfully predicts the strength of ROS composites, captures the effect of strand size on properties, depicts heterogeneous nature of the material, and demonstrates that failure follows the 2 ̆ 01 cweakest-link 2 ̆ 01 d principle. It also indicates that thermoplastic ROS composites are superior to their thermoset (e. g. epoxy) counterparts. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} methods of combining fibrous reinforcement with resin matrix have been dictated by {{the properties of the}} matrix. If a thermoset matrix is used the low viscosity of the unreacted system can be exploited to either mix in quantities of short fibre reinforcement, as with <b>bulk</b> <b>moulding</b> compound, or to infiltrate the resin through reinforcement as with resin transfer moulding, however it is necessary to ensure that the moulded article is formed into its final shape before the resin cures. If a thermoplastic resin is selected then the high viscosity of material means that the blending of reinforcement and fibre must usually be performed under condition of high temperature and shear, as for example by compounding extruder or calendaring. This paper describes a method of exploiting the soluble nature of certain biodegradable polymers to produce an injection mouldable short fibre reinforced material without a mechanical compounding stage. This method combines the low viscosity advantages of thermoset systems with the continuing mouldability of thermoplastics. It is anticipated that this method will allow the production of mouldable compounds on the farm, thus allowing the grower to benefit from the higher value of a semi-finished produc...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for composites {{leads to a}} growing amount of end-of-life material and production waste. The latter consists of a large fraction of unimpregnated fibre waste which is not sufficiently reprocessed using conventional textile processing procedures as they are either too expensive or their mechanical performance is too low. Using pieces of dry non-crimp fabrics (patches) in a <b>Bulk</b> <b>Moulding</b> Compound process (BMC) displays a straightforward approach of fabric recycling. Adding fillers to the mixture not only offers the opportunity to modify mechanical and electrical properties {{as well as the}} costs but also a chance for a more holistic approach of dry fibre recycling, when conventional fillers like chalk are replaced by ground recycled carbon fibres. In this way, all kind of dry fibre wastes can be reused in one process: Larger offcuts are chopped to smaller rectangular patches whereas waste fractions of small offcuts are processed to carbon fibre powder as filler and processed together with resin to produce BMC materials. Mechanical investigations reveal that the presented approach shows higher specific properties than the conventional filler without compromising the process and material quality...|$|E

The crank body is treated as a composite sandwichstructure, where the interior is a short fibre layer (B. M.

40|$|This project {{involves}} {{the design and}} construction of a fibre cutter {{which can be used}} to chop different types of fibres in order to produce alternative composite materials. Chopped fibre is needed in the production of composite materials for the automotive industry and other sectors. <b>Bulk</b> <b>Moulding</b> Compound (BMC) and Sheet Moulding Compound (SMC) are the most commonly used processes. The process uses chopped glass fibre to produce light composite materials. Currently, the market offers many alternatives to quickly cut glass fibre. However, these methods cannot be used with alternative fibres which are more difficult to handle, so a new fibre cutter is needed to cut alternative fibres and produce new materials which can offer lighter, and more sustainable reinforcement alternatives than glass fibre. The chosen solution has been the modification of an existing fibreglass chopper gun, which was able to cut glass fibre at different lengths with its cutting wheels, but could not cut other types of fibres. After the adaption of the conceptual design to the existing chopper gun, the gun arrangement was able to cut carbon fibre successfully, and is also capable of cutting some types of coated rayon fibre. In order to prove the usefulness of this new design, the chopper gun has been used to cut carbon fibre to produce alternative BMC materials, where, remarkably, that the cutting process just needed 72 seconds to produce 475 grams of chopped carbon fibre. These alternative BMC materials have been tested and compared with conventional glass fibre BMC compounds, demonstrating superior mechanical properties and lower density.
