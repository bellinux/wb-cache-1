5|$|Carl Linnaeus, {{the founder}} of modern <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> gave lemurs their name as early as 1758, when he used it in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae. He {{included}} three species under the genus Lemur: Lemur tardigradus (the red slender loris, now known as Loris tardigradus), Lemur catta (the ring-tailed lemur), and Lemur volans (the Philippine colugo, now known as Cynocephalus volans).|$|E
5|$|The archaic English {{word for}} walrus—morse—is widely {{thought to have}} come from the Slavic languages, which in turn {{borrowed}} it from Finno-Ugric languages. Compare морж (morž) in Russian, mursu in Finnish, morša in Northern Saami, and morse in French. Olaus Magnus, who depicted the walrus in the Carta Marina in 1539, first referred to the walrus as the ros marus, probably a Latinization of morž, and this was adopted by Linnaeus in his <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is salient to {{note that}} in {{taxonomy}} and <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> the genus name of the martins (the larger-bodied among swallow genera) is Progne, a Latinized form of Procne. Other related genera named after the myth include the Crag Martins Ptyonoprogne, and Saw-wings Psalidoprocne. Coincidentally, {{although most of the}} depictions of the nightingale and its song in art and literature are of female nightingales, the female of the species does not sing—it is the male of the species who sings its characteristic song.|$|E
5000|$|Widespread use. The <b>binomial</b> {{system of}} <b>nomenclature</b> {{is governed by}} {{international}} codes and is used by biologists worldwide. A few binomials have also entered common speech, such as Homo sapiens, E. coli, and Tyrannosaurus rex.|$|R
5000|$|By the {{introduction}} of his <b>binomial</b> system of <b>nomenclature</b> Linnaeus gave plants and animals an essentially Latin nomenclature like vernacular nomenclature in style but linked to published, and hence relatively stable and verifiable, scientific concepts and thus suitable for international use.|$|R
5000|$|There {{exists a}} lot of {{controversy}} on what corresponds as a species in avian malaria parasites. The latin <b>binomials</b> <b>nomenclature</b> used to describe Plasmodium and Hemoproteus parasites is based on a restricted set of morphological characteristics and the restriction to which parasites of birds they are able to infect. Therefore, considering co-speciation events or even species diversity for malaria parasites is surrounded by {{a lot of}} disagreement. Molecular tools have directed classification towards a phylogenetic definition of lineages, based on sequence divergence and the range of hosts in which the parasite can be found. The diversity of avian malaria parasites and other haemosporidia is extremely large, and previous studies have found that the number of parasites approximates the number of hosts, with significant host switching events and parasite sharing. The current approach suggests amplification of the cytochrome b gene of the parasite and the reconstruction of genealogies based on this information. Due to the large amount of lineages and different host species, a public database called MalAvi has been created to encourage sharing these sequences and aid in understanding the diversity of these parasites. Considering that no other genetic markers have been developed for this group of parasites, a ~1.2-4% sequence divergence has been determined as a cutoff value to distinguish between different parasite lineages. [...] The molecular approach has also allowed direct comparisons between host phylogenies and parasite genealogies, and significant co-speciation has been found based on event-based-matching of phylogenetic trees.|$|R
5|$|The {{establishment}} of universally accepted conventions for {{the naming of}} organisms was Linnaeus' main contribution to taxonomy—his work marks {{the starting point of}} consistent use of <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, Linnaeus also developed {{what became known as the}} Linnaean taxonomy; the system of scientific classification now widely used in the biological sciences. A previous zoologist Rumphius (1627–1702) had more or less approximated the Linnaean system and his material contributed to the later development of the binomial scientific classification by Linnaeus.|$|E
5|$|This {{approach}} {{coupled with}} the new Linnaean system of <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature</b> resulted in plant encyclopaedias without medicinal information called Floras that meticulously described and illustrated the plants growing in particular regions. The 17th century also {{marked the beginning of}} experimental botany and application of a rigorous scientific method, while improvements in the microscope launched the new discipline of plant anatomy whose foundations, laid by the careful observations of Englishman Nehemiah Grew and Italian Marcello Malpighi, would last for 150 years.|$|E
5|$|Fries himself {{declined}} {{to keep the}} genus separate, instead classifying Gomphus as a tribus (subgenus) within the genus Cantharellus in his 1821 work Systema Mycologicum, the species becoming Cantharellus clavatus. He recognized four varieties: violaceo-spadiceus, carneus, purpurascens and umbrinus. Swiss mycologist Louis Secretan described three taxa—Merulius clavatus carneus, M.clavatus violaceus and M.clavatus purpurascens—in his 1833 work Mycographie Suisse. Many of his names have been rejected for nomenclatural purposes because Secretan had a narrow species concept, dividing many taxa into multiple species that were not supported by other authorities, and his works did not use <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature</b> consistently. Fries revised his classification in his 1838 book Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici seu Synopsis Hymenomycetum, placing it in a series—Deformes—in the genus Craterellus.|$|E
5000|$|The word officinalis {{literally}} means [...] "of or {{belonging to}} an officina", the storeroom of a monastery, where medicines and other necessaries were kept. Officina was a contraction of opificina, from opifex (gen. opificis) [...] "worker, maker, doer" [...] (from opus [...] "work") + -fex, -ficis, [...] "one who does," [...] from facere [...] "do, perform". When Linnaeus invented the <b>binomial</b> system of <b>nomenclature,</b> {{he gave the}} specific name [...] "officinalis", in the 1735 (1st Edition) of his Systema Naturae, to plants (and sometimes animals) with an established medicinal, culinary, or other use.|$|R
50|$|Gmelin was {{the author}} of Historia Fucorum (1768), the first work {{dedicated}} to marine biology, dealing exclusively with algae and the first using the <b>binomial</b> system of <b>nomenclature.</b> It includes elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves. However, algal specimens used by Gmelin in the Historia fucorum are thought to no longer exist (Dixon & Irvine, 1970). The results of his travels were published in Reise durch Russland zur untersuchung der drey natur-reiche (Trip through Russia to study the three natural provinces) (1770-1784, 4 vols.). The final volume was to be completed by Guldenstadt but was ultimately edited by Peter Simon Pallas after Guldenstadt's death.|$|R
50|$|Later on {{number of}} new plant species {{were added to the}} then known {{pharmacopoeia}} of indigenous medicinal plants. Attempts were also made to identify the required medicinal plant species by observing their exomorphic characters. For example, plant species like Bala (Sida acuta Burm.); Atibala (Sida rhombifolia Linn.); Nagabala (Sida spinosa Linn.) and Bhubala (Sida veronicaefolia Lam.) were named and grouped together under one class. In modern classification all these belong to Hibiscus (Malvaceae) family. Indeed, Indian scholars do have realised the importance of correct identity of plants and that the knowledge of diagnostic external morphological characters are essential requirements for that purpose. But they could not imagine the use of <b>Binomial</b> system of <b>nomenclature</b> of the plants and thereby fixing absolute identity of the concerned plant material. Instead of that they have started giving various names to the same plant species by considering broad features like shape, color of flowers, smell, taste, along with local names based on plant profile and mythologicalfolklores in various regional languages. For example, Krisna Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum L.) have 52 different names in various Indian dialects. Such trend of thinking became prelude to more confusion while undertaking any research project on indigenous Indian plants.|$|R
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{classification system}} {{is called the}} Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> How organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), and the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (ICNB). The classification of viruses, viroids, prions, and all other sub-viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and {{is known as the}} International Code of Viral Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN). However, several other viral classification systems do exist.|$|E
5|$|It was the Swedish {{botanist}} Carl Linnaeus {{who finally}} put order into this situation as {{he attempted to}} name all the known organisms of his day. In 1735 his Systema Naturae, which included animals (the tenth edition became {{the starting point for}} zoological nomenclature) was followed by Critica Botanica in 1737, and Philosophia Botanica in 1751. But it was his most comprehensive work on plants, the 1753 publication Species Plantarum that formalised the name of a genus with a single epithet to form the name of a species as two words, the binomial thus making secure the biological system of <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> In these works Linnaeus used a third name as a variety within a species. These varieties included both wild and horticultural variants. The horticultural varieties were still written in Latin and some have persisted to this day.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Jean Cadenat and Jacques Blache {{revisited}} {{the type}} specimens of S. tudes {{and found that}} the lectotype from Nice is likely not a smalleye hammerhead, but rather a fetal whitefin hammerhead (S. couardi, likely a synonym of the scalloped hammerhead, S. lewini). This would also explain the anomalous locality of the Nice specimen, as the smalleye hammerhead is not otherwise known outside of the Americas. By the rules of <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> Sphyra tudes should then become the valid name for the whitefin hammerhead, taking precedence over S. couardi, and the smalleye hammerhead would revert to being Sphyrna bigelowi. Taxonomists, though, have been reluctant to change the names again, preferring to keep the smalleye hammerhead as S. tudes. For this solution to have official status would require a decision by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), to reject the Nice specimen as the lectotype and designate the Cayenne specimen in its place. The relevant petition to the ICZN has not yet been put forth.|$|E
5|$|Mycology is a {{relatively}} new science that became systematic after the development of the microscope in the 17th century. Although fungal spores were first observed by Giambattista della Porta in 1588, the seminal work in the development of mycology is considered to be the publication of Pier Antonio Micheli's 1729 work Nova plantarum genera. Micheli not only observed spores but also showed that, under the proper conditions, they could be induced into growing into the same species of fungi from which they originated. Extending the use of the <b>binomial</b> system of <b>nomenclature</b> introduced by Carl Linnaeus in his Species plantarum (1753), the Dutch Christian Hendrik Persoon (1761–1836) established the first classification of mushrooms with such skill so as to be considered a founder of modern mycology. Later, Elias Magnus Fries (1794–1878) further elaborated the classification of fungi, using spore color and various microscopic characteristics, methods still used by taxonomists today. Other notable early contributors to mycology in the 17th–19th and early 20th centuries include Miles Joseph Berkeley, August Carl Joseph Corda, Anton de Bary, the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne, Arthur H. R. Buller, Curtis G. Lloyd, and Pier Andrea Saccardo. The 20th century has seen a modernization of mycology that has come from advances in biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and biotechnology. The use of DNA sequencing technologies and phylogenetic analysis has provided new insights into fungal relationships and biodiversity, and has challenged traditional morphology-based groupings in fungal taxonomy.|$|R
5|$|Systematic botany {{is part of}} {{systematic}} biology, which {{is concerned with the}} range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.|$|E
25|$|As in the {{examples}} of ardeo 'heron' and abio 'fir', the names of most plants and animals are based on their <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> and so many are Latin or Greek as well.|$|E
25|$|First {{volume of}} Carl Alexander Clerck's Svenska Spindlar published. Describing {{a number of}} spiders in <b>{{binomial}}</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> {{it was the first}} work to employ Linnaeus's binomial system, which had been proposed in his 1753 work Species Plantarum.|$|E
25|$|The 10th {{edition of}} Systema Naturae {{is a book}} written by Carl Linnaeus and {{published}} in two volumes in 1758 and 1759, which marks {{the starting point of}} zoological nomenclature. In it, Linnaeus introduced <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature</b> for animals, something he had already done for plants in his 1753 publication of Species Plantarum.|$|E
25|$|Although Linnaeus’ {{system of}} <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature</b> was rapidly adopted after the {{publication}} of his Species Plantarum and Systema Naturae in 1753 and 1758 respectively, {{it was a long time}} before there was international consensus concerning the more general rules governing biological nomenclature. The first botanical code was produced in 1905, the zoological code in 1889 and cultivated plant code in 1953. Agreement on the nomenclature and symbols for genes emerged in 1979.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of perhaps a hundred common or generic plant and animal names, Esperanto adopts the international <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature</b> of living organisms, using suitable orthography, and changing the nominal and adjectival grammatical endings to -o and -a. For example, the binomial for the guineafowl is Numida meleagris. In Esperanto, therefore, a numido would be any bird of the genus Numida, and a meleagra numido the helmeted guineafowl specifically. Likewise, a numidedo is any bird in the guineafowl family Numididæ.|$|E
25|$|Various debates {{occurred}} over the <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature</b> of this population due to the distinct morphological characteristics that set them apart from other populations of green sea turtles. Obtaining valid information on the lifestyles of the Galápagos green turtle has been difficult for researchers due to their continuous migrations and aquatic habits; most information has been obtained through tagging experiments. The Galápagos green turtle, along with all other populations of green sea turtles, is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of threatened species. All populations are still suffering reductions in numbers despite the many conservation efforts being practiced.|$|E
25|$|The {{exploration}} of the Americas revealed large numbers of new plants and animals that needed descriptions and classification. In {{the latter part of}} the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, careful study of animals commenced and was gradually extended until it formed a sufficient body of knowledge to serve as an anatomical basis for classification. In the late 1740s, Carl Linnaeus introduced his system of <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature</b> for the classification of species. Linnaeus attempted to improve the composition and reduce the length of the previously used many-worded names by abolishing unnecessary rhetoric, introducing new descriptive terms and precisely defining their meaning.|$|E
25|$|From {{the first}} {{identification}} of a bacterial species in 1872, microbial species were named according to the <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> based on largely subjective descriptive characteristics. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, however, it was clear that this nomenclature and classification system required reform. Although several different comprehensive nomenclature systems were invented (most notably, that described in Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, first published in 1923), none gained international recognition. In 1930, a single international body, now named the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes (ICSP), was established to oversee all aspects of prokaryotic nomenclature. Work began in 1936 on drafting a Code of Bacteriological Nomenclature, the first version of which was approved in 1947.|$|E
500|$|In 1758, the dog conch was {{formally}} described and named Strombus canarium by Swedish naturalist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus, who originated {{the system of}} <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> The specific name of this taxon, canarium, {{is derived from the}} Latin canis (dog). The original description given by Linnaeus in his book, Systema Naturae, is in Latin: ...|$|E
500|$|... 18th century plant {{taxonomy}} bequeathed to the 19th century a precise <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature</b> and botanical terminology, {{a system of}} classification based on natural affinities, and {{a clear idea of}} the ranks of family, genus and species — although the taxa to be placed within these ranks remains, as always, the subject of taxonomic research.|$|E
500|$|Carl Linnaeus ( [...] ; 23 May 1707 – 10 January 1778), {{also known}} after his ennoblement as Carl von Linné (...) , was a Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist, who formalised the modern system of naming organisms called <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> He is {{known by the}} epithet [...] "father of modern taxonomy". Many of his {{writings}} were in Latin, and his name is rendered in Latin as [...] (after 1761 Carolus a Linné).|$|E
500|$|In 1821, Elias Magnus Fries {{described}} it as Agaricus phalloides, but included all white amanitas within its description. [...] Finally in 1833, Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link settled on the name Amanita phalloides, after Persoon had named it Amanita viridis 30 years earlier. Although Louis Secretan's use of the name Amanita phalloides predates Link's, it has been rejected for nomenclatural purposes because Secretan's works did not use <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature</b> consistently; some taxonomists have, however, disagreed with this opinion.|$|E
500|$|Taxonomy (...) is {{the science}} of {{defining}} and naming groups of biological organisms {{on the basis of}} shared characteristics. Organisms are grouped together into taxa (singular: taxon) and these groups are given a taxonomic rank; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a super group of higher rank, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy. The principal ranks in modern use are kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species. The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus is regarded as the father of taxonomy, as he developed a system known as Linnaean taxonomy for categorization of organisms and <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature</b> for naming organisms.|$|E
500|$|The {{queen conch}} was {{originally}} described from a shell in 1758 by Swedish naturalist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus, who originated {{the system of}} <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> Linnaeus named the species Strombus gigas, which remained the accepted name for over 200 years. Linnaeus did not mention a specific locality for this species, giving only [...] "America" [...] as the type locality. The specific name is the ancient Greek word [...] (...) , which means [...] "giant", referring to the large size of this snail compared with almost all other gastropod molluscs. Strombus lucifer, which {{was considered to be}} a synonym much later, was also described by Linnaeus in Systema Naturae.|$|E
500|$|In Systema Naturae, the {{unwieldy}} names mostly {{used at the}} time, such as [...] "", were {{supplemented with}} concise and now familiar [...] "binomials", composed of the generic name, followed by a specific epithet – in the case given, Physalis angulata. These binomials {{could serve as a}} label to refer to the species. Higher taxa were constructed and arranged in a simple and orderly manner. Although the system, now known as <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers (see Gaspard Bauhin and Johann Bauhin) almost 200 years earlier, Linnaeus was the first to use it consistently throughout the work, including in monospecific genera, and may be said to have popularised it within the scientific community.|$|E
500|$|The {{zebra shark}} was first {{described}} as Squalus varius by Seba in 1758. No type specimen was designated, though Seba included a comprehensive description in Latin and an accurate illustration of a juvenile. Müller and Henle placed this {{species in the}} genus Stegostoma in 1837, using the specific epithet fasciatus (or the neuter form fasciatum, as Stegostoma is neuter while Squalus is masculine) from an 1801 work by Bloch and Schneider. In 1984, Compagno rejected the name [...] "varius/m" [...] in favor of [...] "fasciatus/m" [...] for the zebra shark, because Seba did not consistently use <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature</b> in his species descriptions (though Squalus varius is {{one that can be}} construed as a binomial name). In Compagno's view, the first proper usage of [...] "varius/m" [...] was by Garman in 1913, making it a junior synonym. Both S. fasciatum and S. varium are currently in wide usage for this species.|$|E
500|$|In July 1736, Linnaeus {{travelled}} to England, at Clifford's expense. He went to London {{to visit}} Sir Hans Sloane, a collector of natural history, {{and to see}} his cabinet, {{as well as to}} visit the Chelsea Physic Garden and its keeper, Philip Miller. He taught Miller about his new system of subdividing plants, as described in [...] Miller was in fact reluctant to use the new <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> preferring the classifications of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and John Ray at first. Linnaeus, nevertheless, applauded Miller's Gardeners Dictionary, The conservative Scot actually retained in his dictionary a number of pre-Linnaean binomial signifiers discarded by Linnaeus but which have been retained by modern botanists. He only fully changed to the Linnaean system in the edition of The Gardeners Dictionary of 1768. [...] Miller ultimately was impressed, and from then on started to arrange the garden according to Linnaeus' system.|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} {{legacy of}} the herbal is to botany. Up to the seventeenth century, botany and medicine were {{one and the same}} but gradually greater emphasis was placed on the plants rather than their medicinal properties. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, plant description and classification began to relate plants to one another and not to man. This was the first glimpse of non-anthropocentric botanical science since Theophrastus and, coupled with the new system of <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> resulted in [...] "scientific herbals" [...] called Floras that detailed and illustrated the plants growing in a particular region. These books were often backed by herbaria, collections of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. In this way modern botany, especially plant taxonomy, was born out of medicine. As herbal historian Agnes Arber remarks – [...] "Sibthorp's monumental Flora Graeca is, indeed, the direct descendant in modern science of the De Materia Medica of Dioscorides." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} given the name Auricularia auricula-judae in 1888 by Joseph Schröter. The {{specific}} name of A.auricula-judae comprises auricula, the Latin word meaning ear, and Judae, meaning of Judas. Under <b>binomial</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> a species name can comprise only two words; but the taxonomists responsible for this naming hyphenated the specific name to [...] "bend the rules" [...] and keep the name [...] "within {{the letter of the}} law". The name was criticised by mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd, who said [...] "Auricularia auricula-Judae is cumbersome and in addition is a slander on the Jews". Though critical of Lucien Marcus Underwood, saying he [...] "would probably not have known the Jew's ear from the calves' liver", he followed him in using Auricularia auricula, which was in turn used by Bernard Lowy in an article on the entire genus. Despite this, Auricularia auricula-judae is the currently recognised name for the species by many sources, though Auricularia auricula is still occasionally used.|$|E
