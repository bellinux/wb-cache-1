His 2010 opening, Bread Street Kitchen, {{was based on the}} same concept as Plane Food, as its location within the One New Change office and retail development created a similar need to cater for quick dining and a high volume of single diners.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian General Ali Abdul Hameed was {{dispatched}} <b>by</b> <b>plane,</b> {{and arrived}} on September 29 {{to assess the}} situation {{and needs of the}} Yemeni Revolutionary Command Council. Egypt sent a battalion of Special Forces (Saaqah) on a mission to act as personal guards for Sallal. They arrived at Hodeida on October 5. Fifteen days after he had left San'a, al-Badr sent a man ahead to the Saudi Arabia to announce that he was alive. He then went there himself, crossing the border near Khobar, at the north-eastern edge of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Lord Howe Island {{is known}} for its geology, birds, plants, and marine life. Popular tourist {{activities}} include scuba diving, birdwatching, snorkelling, surfing, kayaking, and fishing.

The island is reached <b>by</b> <b>plane</b> from Sydney Airport or Brisbane Airport in less than two hours. The Permanent Park Preserve declared in 1981 has similar management guidelines to a National Park.|$|E

5|$|The American {{prisoners were}} quickly {{returned}} to the United States, most <b>by</b> <b>plane.</b> Those who were still sick or weakened remained at American hospitals to continue to recuperate. On February11, 1945, 280 POWs left Leyte aboard the transport USS General A.E. Anderson bound for San Francisco via Hollandia, New Guinea. In an effort to counter the improved American morale, Japanese propaganda radio announcers broadcast to American soldiers that submarines, ships, and planes were hunting the General Anderson. The threats {{proved to be a}} bluff, and the ship safely arrived in San Francisco Bay on March8, 1945.|$|E

5|$|As Tam was developing, {{residents}} {{attempted to}} evacuate the island <b>by</b> <b>plane,</b> with the primary target of Fiji. Only a few flights took off before officials closed the airport, stranding numerous passengers. Late on January 11, RSMC Nadi placed Tonga and Futuna under a tropical cyclone alert and also placed Tonga and Wallis under a strong wind warning. Early the next day RSMC Nadi placed northern Tonga under a tropical cyclone gale warning. Later that morning they canceled the tropical cyclone alert for Wallis and Futuna as Tam was not expected to directly affect Futuna anymore. During that afternoon RSMC Nadi placed Niue under a Tropical cyclone alert, as they predicted that Niue {{would be affected by}} Tam within 24 hours. Early on January 13 RSMC Nadi cancelled the tropical cyclone warnings and alerts for Tonga, whilst at the same time placing Niue under a tropical cyclone gale warning, however this gale warning was canceled later that day as Tam moved into the southern ocean.|$|E
5|$|At the Quahog Gay Pride Day festivities, in a raffle {{sponsored}} by Weenie and the Butt, Brian wins tickets to see Celine Dion in Las Vegas. As they prepare to travel, Stewie convinces Brian {{to use the}} new teleportation device he has been working on instead. Stewie's device appears to have malfunctioned, and he believes it failed to work, when it instead created a duplicate set of Brian and Stewie which was teleported to Vegas. The real Brian and Stewie then travel <b>by</b> <b>plane</b> to Vegas. As the duplicated pair check into the Bellagio hotel, their luck makes itself present immediately with the duplicated Brian winning a large jackpot at the slot machines near the entrance. The real Brian and Stewie arrive to find their room has been already taken. As the duplicated pair have the time of their lives, the real pair find themselves in a third-rate hotel. Trying their luck, they quickly lose all of the money they brought.|$|E
5|$|Like the board, {{which might}} be an ad hoc affair, the actual exam {{questions}} were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate {{was expected to be}} able to splice ropes, reef a sail, work a ship in sailing and shift his tides. In navigation, he was expected {{to be able to keep}} a reckoning of the ship's way <b>by</b> <b>plane</b> sailing, to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the variation of the compass. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an able seaman and midshipman.|$|E

The Star-Club, opened by Manfred Weissleder, had a {{capacity}} for two thousand people, as well as cinema-style seating. When the Beatles were booked to play there, Neil Aspinall left his job to become the Beatles' permanent road manager, as he was earning more money driving them around than he was earning by being an accountant, and had his van ferried to Hamburg. The Beatles returned to Hamburg <b>by</b> <b>plane</b> to play from 13 April to 31 May 1962. Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Zhou Enlai made {{an effort}} to save Peng by placing him under PLA surveillance. On December 25, Zhou's office ordered the Red Guards who had {{abducted}} Peng to accompany members of the PLA from Chengdu, to deliver Peng to Beijing by train (instead of <b>by</b> <b>plane,</b> because the airports in Sichuan had been taken over by Red Guards), and then to deliver Peng to the Beijing PLA garrison. After the party arrived in Beijing, Wang Dabin successfully directed Red Guards under his command to delay the PLA unit scheduled to take possession of Peng, and succeeded in keeping Peng from being saved.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the visit, the US {{government}} and the AFV made thorough preparations to make Diá»‡m's visit pleasant, and the AFV successfully lobbied the media to write favourable reports on the South Vietnamese leader. Diá»‡m was trumpeted {{as a champion of}} democracy, and mentions of his autocratic style and election rigging were avoided. Diá»‡m arrived <b>by</b> <b>plane</b> in Washington, D.C. on May 8, and was personally greeted at the airport by President Dwight D. Eisenhowerâ€”an honor Eisenhower accorded to only one other visiting head of state. Diá»‡m's motorcade was greeted by 50,000 wellwishers and his address to the US Congress and his policies were heartily endorsed by both sides of politics. During his time in the US capital, Diá»‡m also attended receptions, and had private meetings with both Eisenhower and the US Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, to discuss American support for South Vietnam, although the meeting with Dulles was ineffectual as Diá»‡m spoke continuously, rendering two-way discussions impossible.|$|E

5|$|Race {{director}} Angelo Zomegnan {{commented that}} the route {{was designed to be}} easier than that of the extremely climbing-intensive 2006 Giro. The Giro's twenty-one stages were divided into the following classifications: three time trials (one team and two individual), eleven flat or undulating stages (officially there was no distinction made between flat and undulating), four intermediate stages, and three mountain stages. The race began with a team time trial on the island of Sardinia. This was followed by two flat stages and an unusually early rest day to transfer from Sardinia to Italy's mainland. The riders transferred <b>by</b> <b>plane</b> while the Giro caravan, race officials and team cars made the trip by boat. The final stage, as was tradition, was a flat, mostly ceremonial road stage to Milan, finishing with ten circuits on the Corso Venezia of the Via Montenapoleone.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dave starts listing to Hurley why the island events are {{occurring}} in his mind suffered from continuous interruption, as military exercises on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam led to many takes being ruined <b>by</b> <b>plane</b> noises. Weather problems also plagued production, with loud waves causing Hurley's and Libby's beach scene to be redubbed in post-production, and rain on one day changing {{the location of the}} basketball game scene to an indoor court, and also leading to a second day of filming on the cliff. The cliff was digitally redesigned in post-production to appear as if the actors were standing on the edge. Dave's jump was done by making a stunt double jump in front of a bluescreen, with the body hitting the water and resulting splash being rendered through computer graphics. The mental hospital was shot at the Laniakea YWCA in Honolulu, except for Dr. Brooks's office, which was done inside a studio.|$|E
