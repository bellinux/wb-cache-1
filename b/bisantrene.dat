40|$|The {{effect of}} 3 {{anthracene}} derivatives, mitoxantrone, ametantrone, <b>bisantrene,</b> on 4 normal human bone marrows, was studied using the {{myeloid stem cell}} assay developed by Pike and Robinson, in order to define to what extent this test {{could be used to}} predict the relative clinical hematologic toxicity of new anticancer agents. For the 3 drugs, an exponential relationship between colony survival and drug concentration was found, but was much steeper for mitoxantrone (slope = - 195. 2 +/- 8. 8 /micrograms/ml) than for ametantrone (slope = 5. 1 +/- 1. 0 /micrograms/ml, p {{less than or equal to}} 0. 001) and <b>bisantrene</b> (slope = 7. 1 +/- 0. 3 /micrograms/ml, p less than or equal to 0. 001). The difference of slope between ametantrone and <b>bisantrene</b> was of borderline significance (p less than or equal to 0. 05). The ratios of concentrations inducing a 50 % growth inhibition for mitoxantrone versus <b>bisantrene</b> and for ametantrone versus <b>bisantrene</b> were close to the corresponding ratios of concentrations inducing a 90 % growth inhibition. The relative in vitro toxicities reproduce very well the relative myelosuppression observed in clinical trials with mitoxantrone versus <b>bisantrene</b> but the results were less satisfactory for the comparison of these 2 agents with ametantrone. In addition, our data suggest that, for these 3 compounds, intrinsic myeloid progenitor sensitivity is a major determinant of leukopenia.

40|$|To {{identify}} structural determinants for the sequencespecific {{recognition of}} covalent topoisomerase II-DNA complexes by anti-cancer drugs, we investigated {{a number of}} <b>bisantrene</b> congeners, including a 10 -azabioisoster, bearing one or two 4, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-imidazol- 2 -yl hydrazone side chains at positions 1, 4, or 9 of the anthracene ring system. The studied bisantrene/amsacrine (m-AMSA) hybrid and <b>bisantrene</b> isomers were able to poison DNA topoisomerase II with an intermediate activity between those of <b>bisantrene</b> and m-AMSA. Moving the side chain from the central to a lateral ring (from C- 9 to C- 1 /C- 4) only slightly modified the drug DNA affinity, whereas it dramatically affected local base preferences of poison-stimulated DNA cleavage. In contrast, switching the planar aromatic systems of <b>bisantrene</b> and m- AMSA did not substantially alter the sequence specificity of drug action. A computer-assisted steric and electrostatic alignment analysis of the test compounds was {{in agreement with the}} experimental data, since a common pharmacophore was shared by <b>bisantrene,</b> m- AMSA, and 9 -substituted analogs, whereas the 1 -substituted isomer showed a radically changed pharmacophoric structure. Thus, the relative space occupancy and electron distribution of putative DNA binding (aromatic rings) and enzyme binding (side chains) moieties are fundamental in directing the specific action of topoisomerase II poisons and in determining the poison pharmacophore...|$|E

Adult female BALB/c mice were dehaired dorsally and given 0. 5 mg intradermal injections of the DNA intercalators, doxorubicin and <b>bisantrene.</b> The mice-re then housed in plexiglass cages and exposed to 2 -Hz PEMF of repetitive pulse bursts of 250 μsec or 20 μsec duration. Skin lesions and survival were assessed daily. There was no significant skin toxicity reduction with either PEMF treatment for doxorubicin (acute ulceration) or <b>bisantrene</b> (chronic ulceration). The inclusion of topical DMSO treatments also did not reduce skin ulceration and appeared to increase doxorubicin lethality. The PEMF treatments appeared to slightly increase some of the vesicant ulcers and doxorubicin lethality. © 1986 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bisantrene</b> (NSC 337766) is an anthracenedicarboxaldehyde {{hydrazone}} {{demonstrating a}} wide spectrum of activity in animal tumor model systems with no evidence of cardiotoxicity or alopecia, in contrast to doxorubicin. Thirty-three women with advanced adenocarcinoma of the breast were treated with 260 mg/m 2 IV every 3 weeks. All patients had received at least one prior combination chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease and 32 / 33 were refractory to doxorubicin. Of 28 patients evaluable for response one had a partial response lasting 10 weeks and three patients had stable disease for 22, 22, and 9 weeks. The most significant toxicities were nonhematologic: nausea and vomiting (41 %), phlebitic reactions (38 %), hypotension, one fatal anaphylactic reaction, {{and the development of a}} 7 th cranial nerve palsy during drug infusion. Hematologic toxicity, leukopenia, was dose-limiting but manageable without associated infections or bleeding. These results indicate that <b>bisantrene</b> in this dose and schedule is not a useful drug in heavily pretreated breast cancer patients. The incidence and severity of phlebitic reactions limited venous access and adversely affected patient compliance. Preliminary results of other phase II breast cancer trials indicate a similar spectrum of toxicity but suggest more significant antitumor activity even in patients previously treated with doxorubicin. Trials conducted in patients with minimal prior treatment and with <b>bisantrene</b> administered via central line appear warranted for definitive assessment of the activity of this agent in breast cancer...|$|E

40|$|A multidrug-resistant {{variant of}} the human HL- 60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL- 60 /MX 2) has been {{isolated}} in vitro by subcultiiring these cells in progressively increasing concentrations of mitovaut rone. The MX 2 cells are cross-resistant to etoposide, teniposide, <b>bisantrene,</b> dactinontycin, 4 '-(9 -acridinylamino) methanesulfon-m-anisididc, and the anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin but retain sensitivity to the Vinca alkaloids melphalan and mitomycin C.

40|$|We {{selected}} a human colon carcinoma cell line in increasing concen trations of mitoxantrone {{to obtain a}} resistant subline, S l-M 1 - 3. 2. with the following characteristics: profound resistance to mitoxantrone; significant cross-resistance to doxorubicin, <b>bisantrene,</b> and topotecan; and very low levels of resistance to Taxol, vinblastine, colchicine, and camptothecin. This multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, which was not reversed by verapamil or another potent P-glycoprotein (Pgp) inhibitor, CL 329, 753, was dependent, in part, upon an energy-dependent drug efflux mecha nism. Pgp and the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) were not elevated in the resistant cells relative to the drug-sensitive parent, suggesting that resistance was mediated by a novel pathway of drug transport. A cellbased screen with S 1 -M 1 - 3. 2 cells was used to identify agents capable of circumventing this non-Pgp, non-MRP MDR. One of the active agents identified was a mycotoxin, fumitremorgin C.

40|$|A human colon {{carcinoma}} {{cell line}} selected for a 21 -fold resistance to mixtoxantrone was cross-resistant to the anthracycline, doxorubicin, {{but not to}} the anthracene, <b>bisantrene.</b> A 2 -fold resistance was observed with vinblastine, another drug associated with multidrug resistance. Net intracellular mitoxantrone and doxorubicin accumulation were decreased at 1 h for all dose levels in the resistant cell line compared to the sensitive cell line. Although the resistant cells were more resistant to mitoxantrone than doxorubicin, the net accumulation of mitoxantrone was only 19 % less than the sensitive cell line; whereas doxorubicin accumulation was decreased by 49 %. No significant difference between the sensitive and resistant cell lines was observed in the initial accumulation of mitoxan trone; however, the efflux of mitoxantrone was increased in the resistant cell line.

40|$|P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the MDR 1 gene, is a plasma {{membrane}} transporter which effluxes {{a large number}} of structurally nonrelated hydrophobic compounds. The molecular basis of the broad substrate recognition of P-gp is not well understood. Despite the 78 % amino acid sequence identity of the MDR 1 and MDR 2 transporter, MDR 2, which has been identified as a phosphatidylcholine transporter, does not transport most MDR 1 substrates. The structural and functional differences between MDR 1 and MDR 2 provide an opportunity to identify the residues essential for the broad substrate spectrum of MDR 1. Using an approach involving exchanging homologous segments of MDR 1 and MDR 2 and site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that MDR 1 residues Q 330, V 331, and L 332 in transmembrane domain 6 are sufficient to allow an MDR 2 backbone in the N-terminal half of P-gp to transport several MDR 1 substrates, including <b>bisantrene,</b> colchicine, vinblastine, and rhodamine- 123. These studies help define some residues important for multidrug transport and indicate the close functional relationship between the multidrug transporter (MDR 1) and phosphatidylcholine flippase (MDR 2) ...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of small}} {{molecules}} able to induce and stabilize selected G-quadruplex arrangements can cause telomerase inhibition and telomere dysfunction in cancer cells, thus providing very selective therapeutic approaches. Effective stabilizers usually comprise a planar aromatic portion to grant effective stacking onto the G-quartet and positively charged side chains {{to exploit the}} highly negative charge density on the quadruplex grooves. Since the relative position of these two pharmacophoric moieties is expected {{to play an important}} role in DNA folding stabilization, we evaluated a series of anthracene derivatives substituted with one or two 4, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-imidazol- 2 -yl-hydrazonic groups (the <b>bisantrene</b> side chain) at different positions of the aromatic system. Indeed, the various regioisomers showed distinct binding affinities for telomeric G-quadruplex, and the most effective was the 1, 5 and 1, 7 bissubstituted analogues. On turn, the 1, 8 regioisomer was poorly effective. Interestingly, G-quadruplex binding is clearly related to telomerase inhibition in this class of compounds, thus confirming their ability to shift the nucleic acid conformational equilibrium upon binding and consequently produce interference with the telomere processing enzyme. Additionally, the 1, 5 regioisomer was shown to inhibit telomerase activity at lower concentrations than those required to reduce tumor cell proliferation. Comparative analysis of drug effects in telomerase-positive and telomerase-negative cancer cells showed consistent cell growth impairment, as a consequence of activation of the senescence pathway, which was mainly attributable to anthracene-mediated telomere dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} structure-activity relationships {{for drugs}} {{that are able to}} poison or inhibit topoisomerase II, we investigated the thermodynamics and stereochemistry of the DNA binding of a number of anthracene derivatives bearing one or two 4, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-imidazol- 2 -yl-hydrazone side chains (characteristic of <b>bisantrene)</b> at different positions of the planar aromatic system. An aza-bioisostere, which can be considered a bisantreneamsacrine hybrid, was also tested. The affinity for nucleic acids in different sequence contexts was evaluated by spectroscopic techniques, using various experimental conditions. DNA-melting and DNase I footprinting experiments were also performed. The location and number of the otherwise identical side chains dramatically affected the affinity of the test compounds for the nucleic acid. In addition, the new compounds exhibited different DNA sequence preferences, depending on the locations of the dihydroimidazolyl-hydrazone groups, which indicates a major role for the side-chain position in generating specific contacts with the nucleic acid. Molecular modeling studies of the intercalative binding of the 1 - or 9 -substituted isomers to DNA fully supported the experimental data, because a substantially more favorable recognition of A-T steps, compared with G-C steps, was found for the 9 -substituted derivative, whereas a much closer energy balance was found for the 1 -substituted isomer. These results compare well with the alteration of base specificity found for the topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage stimulated by the isomeric drugs. Therefore, DNA-binding specificity appears to represent an important determinant for the recognition of the topoisomerase-DNA cleavable complex by the drug, at least for poisons belonging to the amsacrinebisantrene family...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the response rates (RR) and duration to second- and third-line chemotherapy programmes in patients with anthracycline-resistant breast cancer, utilizing various definitions of anthracycline resistance. This was a retrospective analysis performed on 1335 patients with metastatic breast cancer who participated in consecutive clinical trials of first line, anthracycline-containing combination chemotherapy (ACCC) at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between July 1973 and April 1980. Anthracycline-resistant groups were identified using definitions of anthracycline resistance found in the literature: progressive disease as best response to ACCC (Group 1, n = 56 patients); progressive disease while receiving ACCC after an intervening response to the drug (Group 2, n = 84); progressive disease within 6 months of last dose of ACCC (Group 3, n = 233); and progressive disease within 12 months of last dose of ACCC (Group 4, n = 272). Second- and third-line therapies administered to these patients included methotrexate, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, <b>bisantrene,</b> vinblastine, vindesine, melphalan, mitomycin, cisplatin, etoposide and others, but not taxanes. The distribution of patients' characteristics was similar between the four groups, as was the use of second- and third-line regimens. Response rate (RR) to second-line chemotherapy were 5 % and 7. 7 % for Group 1 and Group 2 respectively. In contrast, RR to second-line chemotherapy were 21. 6 % and 15 % for Group 3 and 4. The differences in response rate between the combination of Groups 1 and 2 and Groups 3 or 4 were significant (P = 0. 005 and P = 0. 04 respectively). These results indicate that strictly defined anthracycline resistance as defined in Groups 1 and 2 is associated with resistance to many other cytotoxic drugs. The definitions used in Groups 3 and 4 include many patients with responsive tumours, and a more favourable prognosis. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E
40|$|Quinocarcin binds to d(ATGCAT) ₂ with a {{preferred}} direction of 3 ' and the R configuration at C 4 of the drug. A {{mode of action}} involving ring opening of the oxazolidine ring to form an iminium ion which can then alkylate the N 2 of guanine has been reinforced by the current computer modeling study. The absolute configuration for quinocarcin should be reversed {{based on the fact}} that the optical isomer of the structure arbitrarily assigned in the literature forms a much better binding complex to DNA. Anthramycin binds to the 2 -amino group of guanine but its mechanism of action proceeds through a neutral imine. The 3 ' direction is again favored but for this molecule, the preferred configuration is S. This computer modeling study provided a basis for a 2 D NMR study which confirmed that anthramycin forms a 3 'S adduct when it binds to d(ATGCAT) ₂. <b>Bisantrene</b> and R 9 are synthetic anthracene derivatives with antitumor activity. Use of UV spectroscopy provided insight into the ability of these compounds to intercalate between the base pairs of double helical DNA. Standard Scatchard plot analysis proved useless in determining the binding parameters. A McGhee-von Hippel equation was able to describe a portion of the data but a smoothing spline function was able to describe the data completely. Naphthyridinomycin studies indicate that it too prefers a covalent adduct in which the direction is 3 ' and the configuration is R at C 7. When the noncovalent drug binds to d(ATGCAT) ₂ it may bind with either the C 3 a face or the C 7 face closest to N 2 of guanine. Iminium ion mechanisms have been proposed for the binding of naphthyridinomycin to N 2 of guanine in the minor groove of DNA and the computer modeling presents evidence to support such mechanisms. Saframycin A binds much better to d(GATGCATC) ₂ as a hydroquinone species but the quinone can still bind in the same site. The 3 ' direction is clearly preferred with the R configuration at C 7. The hydrogen bonding network of the hydroquinone is conserved in the noncovalent, iminium ion, and covalent 3 'R models after 32 ps of dynamics. Iminium ion mechanisms have been proposed for the binding of saframycin A to N 2 of guanine in the minor groove of DNA and the computer modeling presents evidence to support such mechanisms...|$|E
