5|$|As {{time went}} <b>by,</b> <b>authorities</b> {{received}} few tips regarding Power's location {{and she was}} eventually removed from the Most Wanted Fugitives list in 1984.

While living in Oregon, Power taught cooking classes at Linn-Benton Community College in Albany and worked at restaurants in Corvallis and Eugene. She reached the shortlist for the post of food writer for the Corvallis Gazette-Times and became part-owner of Napoli Restaurant and Bakery in Eugene.|$|E
5|$|Bonstelle's Playhouse {{was one of}} America's first civic theaters and, uniquely in the 1920s, a {{profitable}} one. Though it closed in 1933, a year after her death, due {{to the rise of}} the movie industry and the Depression, Wayne State University bought the premises in 1956 for the use of its theater department, and in 1963 renamed it the Bonstelle Theatre in her memory. Bonstelle's approach gained nationwide attention and she was interviewed <b>by</b> <b>authorities</b> from other cities which wanted information about her plan. Her theater influenced the future Federal Theater Project.|$|E

In this argumentation, the doctor might explicitly present him- or herself as an authority, thereby presenting an argument <b>by</b> <b>authority.</b> Depending on the specific conditions under which the doctor advances such an argument, the doctor’s argument <b>by</b> <b>authority</b> can constitute a sound or a fallacious contribution to the discussion.

Bačić claimed that while no specific order to attack was received, Tus did instruct him to respond aggressively and capture as much territory as possible in cases of grave breaches of ceasefire by the RSK forces. Nevertheless, Bačić was reprimanded by the President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman because of the offensive. In the RSK, Torbica was forced to resign his post and was replaced by Major General Mile Novaković.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He used to say that he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required <b>by</b> <b>authorities.</b>|$|E

Another attempt a month later to form a union of white collar professionals was also quickly broken up <b>by</b> <b>authorities</b> and its founder Vladimir Svirsky arrested.|$|E

Adela Kogălniceanu was robbed and murdered in October 1920; rumor had it that she had been killed by her own son, but this path was never pursued <b>by</b> <b>authorities,</b> who were quick to cancel the investigation (at the time, they were faced with the major strikes of 1920).|$|E

5|$|On June 25, a tipster, who {{was later}} {{revealed}} to be Taylor's sister Laurie Galli, contacted Washington Terrace Police officer Marcia Gathercole with information connected to the murder.

He was arrested at about 9 p.m. on June 28 {{at the home of}} his half-sister/incestous lover Tresa Taylor in Ogden, Utah and charged with first-degree burglary, first-degree child rape, and first-degree murder the next morning. Taylor had arrived from Florida four days before the murder and had been staying with another sister in the same apartment complex.|$|E
5|$|Prior to his arrest, Chandler {{worked as}} an {{unlicensed}} aluminum-siding contractor.

Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution, and, during his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he was notable for not having had a single visitor.|$|E

The special police was deployed to Slatina to enforce Šušak's order to cooperate, almost causing an armed clash over the issue. To settle matters, a team was sent to Slatina by Zagreb University's Institute for Forensic Medicine to perform autopsies, retrieve bodies and perform the rest of the procedures in Zagreb.|$|E
