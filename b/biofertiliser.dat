40|$|Organic farming {{often has}} to deal with a {{scarcity}} of readily available nutrients, and this is in contrast to chemical farming which relies on soluble fertilisers. The present study was conducted to ascertain the effect of different combinations of organic manures, rice residues and <b>biofertilisers</b> in organic farming of wheat. The field experiments were carried out on the research farm of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi in 2006 - 07 and 2007 - 08. Treatments consisted of a control (no fertiliser) and six fertiliser treatments, namely, farmyard manure (FYM), vermicompost (VC), FYM + rice residue (RR), VC + RR, FYM + RR + <b>biofertilisers</b> (B), and VC + RR + B. FYM and VC were applied on nitrogen basis (60 kg ha- 1), whereas RR was applied at 6 t ha- 1. For <b>biofertilisers,</b> Azotobacter, cellulolytic culture (CC) and phosphate solubilising bacteria (PSB) were used. The combinations of FYM + RR + B and VC + RR + B resulted in the highest increased growth and yield attributing characters of wheat and increased grain yield of wheat over the control by 81 % and 89 % (Year 1 & Year 2), and net return by 82 % and 73 %. These combinations were significantly superior to all other combinations for all the growth and yield parameters, yield, net profit and grain quality of wheat. The results of this study show that VC + RR + B was the most productive treatment, while FYM + RR + B was the most economical treatment with respect to increasing net profit. This was because of the higher price of vermicompost compared with FYM. Both of these combinations resulted in improved grain quality and nutrient uptake by grain. The present study thus indicates that a combination of FYM + RR + <b>biofertilisers</b> or VC + RR + <b>biofertilisers</b> hold promise for organic wheat farming...|$|R

Supplementary inoculation of soil with mycorrhizal fungi and rhizospheric bacteria may act as a plant growth-promoting factor. The present study aims to assess the potential use of <b>biofertilisers</b> on tomato {{as a way of}} increasing yield and stability of root exploration area. The experiment was set up in greenhouse, regarding the evaluation of growing dynamics of plants, mycorrhization level and obtained yield. The identification of effective inoculation variants can lead to a standardisation of technologies of growing for local plant genotypes. Data analysis was performed based on the ANOVA test, followed by Tukey HSD, principal component analysis and cluster analysis in order to identify the potential of bioproducts to stimulate the development of tomato plants. Application of bacterial <b>biofertilisers</b> does not stimulate enough the aboveground development of plants. An antagonistic reaction is visible between exogenous mycorrhizas and those specific in soil, acting slightly different for each genotype. Mycorrhizal level in root systems is more dependent on applied <b>biofertilisers</b> than on analyzed genotypes. For the variants without additional fertilisers, a high level of mycorrhization is visible only after 75 days from the transplantation.

40|$|Phosphate-solubilising rhizobacteria {{associated}} with Coffea arabica L. in natural coffee forests of southwestern Ethiopia were investigated. The main {{purpose was to}} screen for potential microbial <b>biofertilisers</b> by assessing isolated strains for phosphate solubilisation efficiency and organic acid production in different media. Initial screening was performed on Pikovskaya’s agar (PA). Quantitative colorimetric estimations of mobilised phosphate were made in different broth media {{in the presence of}} two phosphate sources. HPLC was employed for the detection of organic acids. From a total of 395 rhizobacterial isolates tested for P solubilisation, over 72 % (mostly Pseudomonas spp.) formed visible dissolution haloes on PA. Two Erwinia species and a P. chlororaphis strain produced the largest solubilisation indices and also solubilised hydroxyapatite strongly in broth medium. Solubilisation of hydroxyapatite (HAP) /tricalcium phosphate (TCP) by all isolates coincided with a decrease in medium pH. HPLC analyses of culture supernatants confirmed the presence of several organic acids, with 2 -ketogluconic acid dominating. The production of organic acids by these coffee-associated phosphobacteria could be considered the major mechanism involved in the solubilisation of insoluble HAP/TCP. Certain isolates deserve particular attention for bioinoculant development due to their remarkable efficiency of insoluble phosphate solubilisation. The present study could therefore be important with respect to screening of Coffea arabica-associated rhizobacteria that possess direct plant growth-promoting traits for extending the use of indigenous microbes as microbial <b>biofertilisers...</b>|$|R

However few ecotoxicological studies have been performed to evaluate the ecological impact of digestate application on soil. In this study, the use of digestate as <b>biofertiliser</b> in agriculture was assessed by a battery of ecotoxicological tests considering the potential pollutants present in the digestate as a whole by using the "matrix-based" approach (also known as "whole effluent toxicity" for eluates or wastewater effluents).

40|$|Throughout the world, {{there have}} been {{increasing}} interests in the recycling of wastes for sustainable development. This especially applies for organic materials of municipal and agro-industrial origin. Recycling initiatives in Argentina are still incipient. In the last years, the use of earthworms for stabilising organic wastes has been evaluated. In this paper, the authors compile the research results of vermicomposting of organic residues from different raw materials and its use as a <b>biofertiliser,</b> to provide a general outlook {{of the development of}} vermiculture technology in Argentina within the last decade. Research results of bioaccumulation of some trace elements by worms in artificially contaminated systems are also provided. earthworms, organic waste, biodegradation, bioaccumulation, vermiculture technology, waste management, environmental remediation, Argentina, organic residues, biofertilisers,...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to explore the {{possibilities}} of utilising the macroalgae accumulating on the Sopot beach, {{a part of the}} Gulf of Gdansk (Baltic Sea). During this work (2004 - 2006) a range of activities were undertaken: monitoring the occurrence of macroalgae, collection of plant material, taxonomic identification, laboratory analyses of contamination (metals - Cd, Pb, Ni, Zn, Cu, Cr, Hg;radionuclides - 137 Cs, 40 K; organic contaminants - polychlorinated biphenyls,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), the stage of algal degradation and studying possible uses of the plant material collected on the beach. The most suitable way of utilising the plant material seems to be as a <b>biofertiliser.</b> Laboratorygrowth tests were carried out to assess this possible use; they were successful...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{extensive}} research, {{production and}} use of mi-croorganisms to improve plant nutrition have resulted in an inconsistent {{definition of the term}} “biofertiliser ” which, in some cases, is due to the different microbial mechanisms involved. The rationale for adopting the term <b>biofertiliser</b> is that it derives from “biological fertiliser”, that, in turn, implies the use of living microorganisms. Here, we propose a defini-tion for this kind of products which is distinguishing them from biostimulants or other inorganic and organic fertilisers. Special emphasis is given to microorganism(s) with multi-functional properties and biofertilisers containing more than one microorganism. This definition could be included in legal provisions regulating registration and marketing require-ments. A set of rules is also proposed which could guarantee the quality of biofertilisers present on the market and thus foster their use by farmers...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of plant}} growth {{promoting}} bacterial inoculants as live microbial <b>biofertilisers</b> provides a promising alternative to chemical fertilisers and pesticides. Inorganic phosphate solubilisation {{is one of}} the major mechanisms of plant growth promotion by plant associated bacteria. This involves bacteria releasing organic acids into the soil which solubilise the phosphate complexes converting them into ortho-phosphate which is available for plant up-take and utilisation. The study presented here describes the ability of endophytic bacterial isolates to produce gluconic acid, solubilise insoluble phosphate and stimulate the growth of Pea plants (Pisum sativum). This study also describes the genetic systems within three of these endophyte isolates thought to be responsible for their effective phosphate solubilising abilities. The results showed that many of the endophytic isolates produced gluconic acid (14 - 169 mM) and have moderate to high phosphate solubilisation capacities (~ 400 - 1300 mg L- 1). When inoculated to Pea plants grown in sand/soil under soluble phosphate limiting conditions, the endophyte isolates that produced medium to high levels of gluconic acid also displayed enhanced plant growth promotion effects...|$|R

Our results revealed that plants receiving a combination treatment (HNB) recorded significant increases over control in both growing seasons. Moreover, economic evaluation reflects the profound influence of combination treatment (HNB) that realized the maximum gross income and minimum production cost.

40|$|In both managed {{and natural}} ecosystems, {{beneficial}} plant-associated bacteria {{play a key}} role in supporting and/or increasing plant health and growth. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can be applied in agricultural production or for the phytoremediation of pollutants. However, because of their capacity to confer plant beneficial effects, efficient colonization of the plant environment is of utmost importance. The majority of plant-associated bacteria derives from the soil environment. They may migrate to the rhizosphere and subsequently the rhizoplane of their hosts before they are able to show beneficial effects. Some rhizoplane colonizing bacteria can also penetrate plant roots, and some strains may move to aerial plant parts, with a decreasing bacterial density in comparison to rhizosphere or root colonizing populations. A better understanding on colonization processes has been obtained mostly by microscopic visualisation as well as by analysing the characteristics of mutants carrying disfunctional genes potentially involved in colonization. In this review we describe the individual steps of plant colonization and survey the known mechanisms responsible for rhizosphere and endophytic competence. The understanding of colonization processes is important to better predict how bacteria interact with plants and whether they are likely to establish themselves in the plant environment after field application as <b>biofertilisers</b> or biocontrol agents...|$|R
