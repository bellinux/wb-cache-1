25|$|The system {{provides}} sounds {{not found in}} the known Elven languages of the First Age, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was designed for notating a variety of languages. However, the consonants seem to be, more or less, the same found in Welsh phonology, a theory supported by the fact that Tolkien was heavily influenced by Welsh when creating Elven languages.|$|E
25|$|Canton: {{smaller than}} the quarter, {{formally}} said to occupy one-ninth of the shield, though sometimes drawn smaller. The canton is often {{said to be the}} quarter's diminutive, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> should be treated as a subordinary in its own right as it fulfils heraldic functions not fulfilled by the quarter, and behaves according to its own special rules—as for example {{in the case of the}} canton on which baronets in the UK may display the badges of their 'rank', which is very rarely shown occupying such a large area as the upper left third of the field, and is usually much less and very often shown not as square but as a rectangle with its longer side vertical. Very occasionally a 'sinister canton' is found, on the shield's other side.|$|E
25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E

500|$|Watson {{wrote that}} [...] "the chief joy [...] was the {{stealthy}} way the atmospheric story was built up layer by layer". In The Times, Billen described [...] "Sardines" [...] as [...] "a disciplined comedy, {{but a little}} bit of discipline, as one of the League's perverts might say, never did anyone any harm". With the exception of the ending, Billen [...] "loved it". A separate review in The Times, however, praised the twist ending; [...] "this isn't just an inspired set-up performed by a stellar cast – it builds to a macabre and horribly imagined climax." [...] Owen was ambivalent about the ending of [...] "Sardines", saying that it [...] "worked very well in terms of narrative, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> landed with too much softness". Mark Jones, writing in The Guardian, gave a more mixed review overall, describing [...] "Sardines" [...] as a [...] "slow burner, but a decent introduction to a series". Newsome called the episode a [...] "gem of an opener".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked by}} the {{broadcaster}} Melvyn Bragg in 1984 if the portraits painted {{in the wake of}} Dyer's death were depictions of his emotional reaction to the event, Bacon replied that he did not consider himself to be an [...] "expressionist painter". He explained that he was [...] "not trying to express anything, I wasn't trying to express the sorrow about somebody committing suicide... <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> comes through without knowing it". When Bragg inquired if he often thought about death, the artist replied that he was always aware of it, and that although [...] "it's just around the corner for , I don't think about it, because there's nothing to think about. When it comes, it's there. You've had it." [...] Reflecting on the loss of Dyer, Bacon observed that as part of aging, [...] "life becomes more of a desert around you". He told Bragg that he believed in [...] "nothing. We are born and we die and that's it. There is nothing else." [...] Bragg asked Bacon what he did about that reality, and after the artist told him he did nothing about it, Bragg pleaded, [...] "No Francis, you try and paint it." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, a few critics took a more-mixed {{view of the}} album. Emma Johnston {{from the}} English {{language}} version of Metal Hammer rated the album six out of ten, pointing out that [...] "there's little here to have progressive scene-leaders like Opeth looking over their shoulders." [...] She elaborated that apart from the string-drenched interlude on [...] "Dawn of Redemption", [...] "Extol hardly shifts out of a single gear, but it's worth a listen {{for those who like}} their genres bobbing around in a big old melting pot." [...] Anthony Peronto of Christian Music Zine rated it at three-point-seventy-five out of five, summarizing that while metal pioneer comebacks are not entirely new, this one did not entirely click with him. He concluded that [...] "The music itself was excellence in and of itself <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was the odd mix of vocals that let me down. I guarantee after a few listens even a doubter like me will warm up to return of Extol and the album they've always intended to create." [...] Mario of Metal 4 rated the album six out of ten, stating the while the album is decent, it also is fairly predictable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom {{remarked that}} {{something}} had started off the wall. I allow he mayn't have reflected much, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> significant he and you agree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Andrew {{needs some}} encouraging," [...] he remarked. [...] "When there's {{anything}} to be gained for himself, he's too diffident; <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> a good fault, and by no means common." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{think he}} doesn't know {{a single word}} about our having been on the brink o't. <b>But</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> the other way--he's heard of it and that may have brought him.|$|R
2500|$|During his Anfield career Hodgson missed {{very few}} games in league or cup and scored prolifically throughout; therefore, {{it was a}} shame that his career coincided with a barren period for the club because his {{contribution}} to the Liverpool cause was massive. [...] The 36 league goals Hodgson scored during the 1930–31 season beat Sam Raybould’s total of 31 scored in 1902–03 and set a new club record that would last for more than thirty years, until it was beaten by Roger Hunt in 1961–62. [...] Hodgson scored three hat-tricks that season at Anfield <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was the four goals he scored in an away match at Hillsborough that gave him the most satisfaction of all. [...] He was top scorer in seven out of the nine full seasons he played for Liverpool. [...] On completion of his ten years service he was honoured by the club with a benefit sum of £650. His popularity prompted an ingenious biscuit seller to name the home-made ginger nuts, that he sold in a quantity of five for a penny on matchdays at Anfield, in his honour: [...] "Hodgson’s Choice! Hodgson’s Choice!" [...] he would call. [...] The 1935–36 season proved to be Hodgson's last at Anfield; his 9 goals in 17 league appearances was yet again a decent return, but on 8 January 1936 he was allowed to move to Aston Villa [...] for £4,000. [...] In total Hodgson scored 241 goals in 377 appearances for Liverpool in all competitions, earning him a place in the Liverpool FC Hall of Fame and leaving him third in the all-time list of leading goalscorers for the Anfield club with only Ian Rush (346) and Roger Hunt (285) having scored more.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course I myself prefer Moussorgsky," [...] said Aaron. [...] "I {{think he}} is a greater artist. <b>But</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> is just {{personal}} preference." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mehreen Hasan of DAWN Images also rated 3/5 and said, [...] "Balu Mahi is a rom-com {{with some}} dark, {{dramatic}} moments, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> better described and digested as a fantasy film." ...|$|R
6000|$|Something in {{her tone}} again made her hearers laugh out; {{so it was}} still with the air of good humour that Vanderbank answered: [...] "Mere, mere, mere. <b>But</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> exactly the 'mere' that has made us range so wide." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ritika Jain, of the DNA India website, {{offered a}} mixed review of this book, saying, [...] "Book {{six of the}} Clifton Chronicles is a page turner and often unputdownable, <b>but,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>it's</b> time for Jeffrey Archer to give the story the closure it deserves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} makes much difference, Ibrahim, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> is as well to bring them away. We can leave the bundle in the wood.|$|E

6000|$|... 'John! It do sound lackadaisical. What I call womanish. <b>But</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> for the better. We {{have such}} a lot of Jacks.

6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Olivia, [...] "we {{will admit}} that is something, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> not important. Mr. Musgrave has engaged to return your clothes.

6000|$|Then as Christian {{left the}} room she sank back in her chair, with creases in her forehead, and began languidly to cut a magazine. 'Poor Christian!' she thought, 'how hardly she does take it! I am sorry for her; <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> just as well, as things are turning out. Psychologically it is interesting!' ...|$|R
60|$|Jim agreed. Bernard was {{obviously}} not fastidious, like his relatives, {{but he had the}} grand manner. This was not altogether what Jim meant, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> got nearest.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, no!" [...] said Maggie, {{with some}} pity; [...] "Columbus {{was a very}} {{wonderful}} man, who found out half the world, and they put chains on him and treated him very badly, you know; it's in my Catechism of Geography, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> rather too long to tell before tea--I want my tea so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> as {{well that}} she has gone. These cursed {{settlers}} are at their old complaints again about what they call 'Indian depredations,' and I have just received orders from head-quarters to keep the settlement clear of all vagabond aborigines.

6000|$|... "Oh, {{you have}} such a weak will. Or I always thought you had. <b>But</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> only a weak will with other women. I don't know! But Walter Libby!

60|$|Jimmy did {{not know}} why he smiled, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was because he was stirred a little and did not wish to show it. In any case, Valentine frowned at him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Some of {{the tricks}} are clever; they have puzzled you. We will not argue whether all are tricks or not. Anyhow, the clever impostor {{is a common}} type.

6000|$|... “I {{try to make}} it pleasant,” said Mrs. Lemon. “I {{should really}} miss you now; <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it’s</b> your mother’s wish.” If it was a {{question}} of defending her guest from ineligible suitors Mrs. Lemon felt of course that her son was more competent than she; though she had a lurking kindness for Herman Longstraw and a vague idea that he was a gallant genial specimen of unsophisticated young America.|$|R
