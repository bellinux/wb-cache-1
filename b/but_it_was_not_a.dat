5|$|At the Dutch Grand Prix, Rindt {{eventually}} {{used the}} new Lotus 72, better sorted after alterations had been made. He set pole {{position in the}} final practice session, {{almost a quarter of}} a second ahead of his closest challenger, Stewart. Rindt went on to take his maiden victory in the Lotus 72, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> joyful occasion for him; on lap 23, his close friend Piers Courage, with whom he had eaten dinner just the night before, died in a fiery crash. Rindt was heavily shaken by the loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{effective}} anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} U.S. ships, plus evasive maneuvers, the bombs from the first nine Vals missed Enterprise. However, at 16:44, an armor-piercing, delayed-action bomb penetrated the flight deck near the aft elevator and passed through three decks before detonating below the waterline, killing 35 men and wounding 70 more. Incoming sea water caused Enterprise to develop a slight list, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> major breach of hull integrity.|$|E
5|$|Konrad Zuse's Z3 was the world's first working programmable, fully {{automatic}} computer, with binary digital arithmetic logic, but it lacked the conditional branching of a Turing machine. On 12 May 1941, it was successfully presented {{to an audience}} of scientists of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt ("German Laboratory for Aviation") in Berlin. The Z3 stored its program on an external tape, but it was electromechanical rather than electronic. The Colossus of 1943 was the first electronic computing device, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> general-purpose machine.|$|E

5|$|The first {{numbered}} highway {{along the}} SR85 corridor {{was established in}} 1927 between Gila Bend and Phoenix as US80. At the time, it was only paved from Phoenix to Hassayampa. Although not paved between Hassayampa and Gila Bend, it was an improved road. This original routing of US80 still exists as Old US80 west of the SR85 alignment. A dirt road between Gila Bend and Ajo did exist at this time, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> {{part of the state}} highway system. By 1935, the entire route of US80 between Gila Bend and Phoenix had been paved. The road south of Gila Bend had also been improved to a gravel road.|$|E
5|$|Certain areas did {{not report}} their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study {{is the fact that}} the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E
5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the {{equipment}} in the payload bay, the team noticed some fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the crew to take additional images using a higher resolution camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised the crew to avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around the container to avoid the debris, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> significant concern.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{there were}} some who were {{concerned}} by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this {{came to a head}} with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio. Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio. Murena was named among the conspirators, the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair. The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> unanimous verdict. All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed {{as soon as they were}} captured—without ever giving testimony in their defence. Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.|$|E
5|$|Rich {{families}} from Rome usually {{had two or}} more houses, a townhouse (domus, plural domūs) {{and at least one}} luxury home (villa) outside the city. The domus was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (balneum), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> place to retreat from public life. Although some neighbourhoods of Rome show a higher concentration of well-to-do houses, the rich did not live in segregated enclaves. Their houses were meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias (head of household) met with clients every morning, from wealthy friends to poorer dependents who received charity. It was also a centre of family religious rites, containing a shrine and the images of family ancestors. The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces facing the street were often rented out as shops (tabernae). In addition to a kitchen garden—windowboxes might substitute in the insulae—townhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden that brought a tract of nature, made orderly, within walls.|$|E

25|$|The ferries {{were seen}} as past their day, due to their {{mounting}} financial and operational problems, even before {{the construction of the}} Newburgh-Beacon bridge. Increasing traffic on 52 by mid-century, coupled with the building of the New York State Thruway in the Hudson corridor, was straining the ferry beyond its breaking point. The state's Department of Public Works began planning for a bridge, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> serious possibility until federal money became available through the construction of Interstate 84.|$|E

Also shot in Britain was The Dark Avenger (1955), for Allied Artists, in which Flynn played Edward, the Black Prince. Wilcox used him with Neagle again, in King's Rhapsody (1955), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> success, ending plans for further Wilcox-Flynn collaborations. In 1956 he presented and sometimes performed in the television anthology series The Errol Flynn Theatre that was filmed in Britain.|$|E
25|$|In {{other events}} of the nineteenth century, The Times opposed {{the repeal of the}} Corn Laws until the number of demonstrations {{convinced}} the editorial board otherwise, and only reluctantly supported aid to victims of the Irish Potato Famine. It enthusiastically supported the Great Reform Bill of 1832, which reduced corruption and increased the electorate from 400,000 people to 800,000 people (still a small minority of the population). During the American Civil War, The Times represented the view of the wealthy classes, favouring the secessionists, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> supporter of slavery.|$|E

25|$|A gunshot to {{the west}} of the fort was the Pettah of Ahmednagar.

25|$|In 1878, the Swiss {{approved}} in a referendum federal subsidies for an eastern and a western Alpine rail crossing. In 1913 a western Alps was completed, the Lötschberg railway line, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> federal project, but instead {{it was an}} initiative of the canton of Bern. No eastern rail crossing has ever been built. Instead the Rhaetian Railway (RhB) opened the Albula line in 1903 and the Bernina Railway completed the Bernina line in 1910, providing a link to Italy. These lines were initially built for tourists, but they were later also used for freight.|$|E
25|$|VOC {{headquarters}} {{were located}} in Ambon during the tenures {{of the first three}} Governors General (1610–1619), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> satisfactory location. Although it was at the centre of the spice production areas, it was far from the Asian trade routes and other VOC areas of activity ranging from Africa to India to Japan. A location in the west of the archipelago was thus sought. The Straits of Malacca were strategic but had become dangerous following the Portuguese conquest, and the first permanent VOC settlement in Banten was controlled by a powerful local ruler and subject to stiff competition from Chinese and English traders.|$|E
