40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 80 - 82) This study {{attempted to}} determine the physical and microbiological effects of ground hospital solid waste materials on a selected part of the sanitary sewerage system of the City of Los Angeles. The quality of the sewage {{and the effect of}} the sewage on the sewer pipelines were examined during the study. Ground solid waste materials were introduced into the disposal system of two hospitals. Two specially designed solid <b>waste</b> <b>grinding</b> units were installed in a major hospital which was connected to a relatively large, fast-flowing sewer line. A third grinder was installed in a smaller facility which was connected to a sewer line of minimum size and flow. A small number of sewage samples were withdrawn {{prior to the start of}} solid <b>waste</b> <b>grinding</b> and samples were withdrawn monthly for the duration of the investigation. Existing criteria and methods for physical and microbiological analyses of sewage were employed for all samples. Existing methods for evaluation of sewer pipelines were also employed. All sewage samples were analyzed by the City of Los Angeles Bureau of Standards Laboratory. Pipeline tests were performed by the City's industrial waste control officials. Sewage samples were withdrawn from a point slightly downstream from each hospital's connection to the sewer line. The results of analyses of sewage samples taken before and during the grinding operations were compared to one another and to the Los Angeles City's maximum legal levels allowed for discharge of sewage into a sewer. The same results were also compared to the average results of similar tests performed on sewage entering the City's main sewage treatment plant during the year 1968. Based on the comparative results of these analyses, it was concluded that addition of ground hospital solid wastes apparently had no significant effect on the sewage. Additional tests of this type are needed, however, before positive conclusions may be drawn. Several recommendations for similar future studies were made. Based on the results of pipeline evaluations, it was concluded that heavier solid waste materials may tend to settle in sewers with a slow rate of flow. There appeared to be no deleterious effects of ground hospital wastes on the sewer lines, however. Recommendations were made for this phase of future studies, including evaluating the condition of the pipelines prior to the start of grinding (which was not done in this study). The study results must be considered provisional in nature. Further investigation into this method of hospital solid waste disposal, however, could lead to a potential solution for a major public health problem...|$|R

30|$|Recently, Acacia crassicarpa {{has been}} planted in {{peatland}} areas with acidic soil in Indonesia {{for use in}} pulp and paper materials. Its bark is not suitable to produce bleached pulp; hence, it is discarded as waste.

First, the structure of condensed tannin from the <b>bark</b> <b>waste</b> of A. crassicarpa is characterized.

To the best of our knowledge, this dimer is a new compound as evidenced from pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses; it corresponds to a gallocatechin–catechin flavan dimer with the absence of one oxygen atom at the 3 C of the pyran ring.

Usually, 1 g ethanol can produce approximately 27 kJ of energy, and therefore, the energy input for the microwave pretreatment was only 7 % of the energy output.

40|$|AbstractBiosorption {{of nickel}} ions from aqueous {{solutions}} by modified loquat <b>bark</b> <b>waste</b> (MLB) {{has been investigated}} in a batch biosorption process. The biosorbent MLB was characterized by FTIR analysis. The extent of biosorption of Ni(II) ions {{was found to be}} dependent on solution pH, initial nickel ions concentration, biosorbent dose, contact time, and temperature. The experimental equilibrium biosorption data were analyzed by three widely used two-parameters Langmuir, Temkin and Freundlich isotherm models. Langmuir and Temkin isotherm models provided a better fit with the experimental data than Freundlich isotherm model by high correlation coefficients R 2. The maximum adsorption capacity was 27. 548 mg/g of Ni(II) ions onto MLB. The thermodynamic analysis indicated that the biosorption behavior of nickel ions onto MLB biosorbent was an endothermic process, resulting in higher biosorption capacities at higher temperatures. The negative values of ΔG° (− 5. 84 kJ/mol) and positive values of ΔH° (13. 33 kJ/mol) revealed that the biosorption process was spontaneous and endothermic. Kinetic studies showed that pseudo-second order described well the biosorption experimental data.
