5|$|At the 1820 Summer Exhibition, Etty {{exhibited}} two paintings: Drunken Barnaby and The Coral Finder: Venus and her Youthful Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos. Drunken Barnaby is a {{scene of}} a drunken man being carried away from an inn while a <b>barmaid</b> looks on; the <b>barmaid</b> is shown as sturdily built, plump and rosy-cheeked, a style in which Etty would continue to paint women throughout his career. The Coral Finder is strongly inspired by Titian, and depicts Venus Victrix lying nude in a golden boat, surrounded by scantily clad attendants. It was Etty's first use of the combination of nude figures and mythological or literary references {{for which he was}} to become famous.|$|E

40|$|Salaam, was {{undertaken}} during June and July 2000. It sought {{to establish their}} perception of the female condom and its role in the struggle for women sexual empowerment. Ability to negotiate safer sex was considered as a proxy for women sexual empowerment, Only 7 % ~fthem were most able to negotiate. The salary of <b>barmaids</b> ranged from Tanzanian Shillings 4, 000 to 50, 000 per month, and most <b>barmaids</b> had dependants. Low income and increasing number of dependants among <b>barmaids</b> whom are of low level of education, were associated with involvement in multiple sexual relations and became unable to negotiate safer sex. Having multiple sexual relationships was a survival strategy among <b>barmaids.</b> In effect their employment did not improve their economic status but rather it exposed them to risks ofHN infection, STDs and unwanted pregnancies. Though the <b>barmaids</b> realized the possibility for their self-protection, male dominance in the sexual relationships stood as an obstacle for barmaids' efforts against HN infection STDs and unwanted pregnancies, as most of their sexual partners were not in favour of using condoms. Not many <b>barmaids</b> could forego the monetary gains as a result of insisting on condom use. <b>Barmaids</b> perceived the female condom as device meant to empower them sexually but were concerned with its price {{and the fact that it}} was not widely available. vu Multiple approaches for addressing the economic and social deprivation of <b>barmaids</b> and hence their vulnerability in order to empower them for self protection against RIV infection are recommended. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{reality was}} often the exact opposite. <b>Barmaids</b> {{typically}} prided themselves {{on their ability to}} pour, chat, and keep a clean bar simultaneously - not to mention their ability to support themselves and their family - and they deeply resented this characterisation by prohibitionists, but the stereotype stuck. Even though many <b>barmaids</b> loved the job because it offered better pay and greater freedom than typical female occupations like household servants, <b>barmaids</b> remained the object of scorn by 'proper' society.|$|R

5|$|As with The Quatermass Xperiment, the {{screenplay}} for Quatermass 2 condenses {{many of the}} events of the original. The most significant change is at the climax: in the television version Quatermass and his assistant, Pugh, use Quatermass's rocket to travel to the asteroid to take on the aliens on their home turf whereas in the film the rocket is fired, unmanned, at the asteroid to destroy it. Several characters from the television version do not appear in the film, most notably Quatermass's daughter, Paula, and his assistant, Leo Pugh.

5|$|Women in Washington social circles led by Floride Calhoun, {{the wife}} of Vice President John C.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the debates surrounding attempts {{to restrict the}} career of <b>barmaids</b> in Victorian hotels. It argues that the early attempts to prohibit <b>barmaids</b> were largely concerned with labour issues. Male hotel workers feared the incursions of female labour in the bar more than in other hotel occupations due to the pivotal role of the bar in developing careers in hotel management. It is by understanding Victorian attitudes to wealth creation that we can gain insights into the development of rigid hierarchical structure of labour in the modern hotel. ...|$|R
