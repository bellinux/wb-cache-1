25|$|Tarebia granifera {{have been}} {{associated}} with the disappearance of two indigenous benthic gastropod species from rivers in Puerto Rico and have displaced the vegetation-associated pulmonate Biomphalaria glabrata from streams and ponds on several Caribbean islands. Although the responsible mechanism is not understood, this has led to suggestions that it could be useful as a <b>biocontrol</b> <b>agent</b> in snail control operations within integrated schistosomiasis control programmes. They probably also compete for space and resources (e.g. food) with indigenous infaunal and epifaunal invertebrates, especially where its densities are high. Under such conditions it is likely to alter the structure and biodiversity of the entire benthic communities of invaded habitats and perhaps the vegetation-associated communities as well.|$|E
40|$|Biological {{control is}} a crucial tool {{in the battle against}} {{biological}} invasions, but <b>biocontrol</b> <b>agents</b> can have a deleterious impact on native species. Recognition of risks associated with host shifting has increased the emphasis on host specificity of <b>biocontrol</b> <b>agents</b> for invasive weeds. However, recent studies indicate hostspecific <b>biocontrol</b> <b>agents</b> can also exhibit substantial nontarget effects through indirect interactions and food-web subsidies. Based on an evaluation of these studies, we conclude that the interaction strength between <b>biocontrol</b> <b>agents</b> and their hosts is at least as important as host specificity for determining the outcome of biocontrol introductions. Host-specific <b>biocontrol</b> <b>agents</b> that establish, but fail to reduce the densities of their hosts can facilitate bottom-up effect...|$|R

Trichoderma viride, Trichoderma harzianum, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens were evaluated for their antagonistic activity against F. oxysporum f. sp. nicotianae under in vitro conditions. Different <b>biocontrol</b> <b>agents</b> showed varying degrees of antagonism. T. viride and T. harzianum showed 70 and 40 % inhibition of radial growth of the F. oxysporum f. sp. nicotianae respectively in dual culture technique. Mode of parasitism between the <b>biocontrol</b> <b>agents</b> and F. oxysporum f. sp. nicotianae were studied under the microscope. Formation of several loops and coiling of hyphae by T. viride and T. harzianum around the hyphae of the pathogen forming a thick compact rope like structure was observed. The <b>biocontrol</b> <b>agents</b> produced volatile metabolites. These metabolites suppressed the growth of F. oxysporum f. sp. nicotianae. The two <b>biocontrol</b> <b>agents</b> varied in the extent of volatile metabolite production. Among bacteria, B. subtilis inhibited the radial growth of F. oxysporum f. sp. nicotianae by 36 %. The bacterial and fungal antagonists were not mutually antagonistic as the co-inoculation did not inhibit each other.

2500|$|The use of {{biological}} pest control agents, or using predators, parasitoids, parasites, and pathogens to control agricultural pests, {{has the potential}} to reduce agricultural pollution associated with other pest control techniques, such as pesticide use. The merits of introducing non-native biocontrol agents have been widely debated, however. Once released, the introduction of a <b>biocontrol</b> <b>agent</b> can be irreversible. Potential ecological issues could include the dispersal from agricultural habitats into natural environments, and host-switching or adapting to utilize a native species. In addition, predicting the interaction outcomes in complex ecosystems and potential ecological impacts prior to release can be difficult. One example of a biocontrol program that resulted in ecological damage occurred in North America, where a parasitoid of butterflies was introduced to control gypsy moth and browntail moth. [...] This parasitoid is capable of utilizing many butterfly host species, and likely resulted in the decline and extirpation of several native silk moth species.|$|E

This thesis evaluates the biocontrol of crofton weed, Ageratina adenophora, in South Africa, with a stem gall fly, Procecidochares utilis, and a leaf-spot pathogen, Passalora ageratinae. The issues of multiple <b>biocontrol</b> <b>agents,</b> pathogen-insect interactions, the assessment of agent efficacy and post-release evaluations in biocontrol are addressed using crofton weed biocontrol as a case study. Laboratory trials showed an additive interaction between the fly and pathogen on crofton weed control. The fly inhibited vertical stem growth, with the gall acting as a nutrient sink, but crofton weed compensated with increased sideshoot growth. The pathogen inhibited sideshoot (vegetative reproduction) growth. Field trials showed an equivalent interaction between the two <b>biocontrol</b> <b>agents.</b> The pathogen inhibited sideshoot growth, however the fly did not inhibit stem height but the galled stems had less biomass allocated to bare stems, than sideshoots or live leaves, indicating weakened stems.
