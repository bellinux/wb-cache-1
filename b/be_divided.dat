5|$|The GCD can be visualized as follows. Consider a {{rectangular}} area a by b, and any common divisor c that divides both a and b exactly. The {{sides of the}} rectangle can <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> into segments of length c, which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length c. The greatest common divisor g is the largest value of c for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12=2) and five squares along the other (60/12=5).|$|E
