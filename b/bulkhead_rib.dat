50|$|Integral {{frame and}} body {{construction}} requires more than simply welding an unstressed body to a conventional frame. In a fully integrated body structure, the entire car is a load-carrying unit that handles all the loads experienced by the vehicleâ€”forces from driving as well as cargo loads. Integral-type bodies for wheeled vehicles are typically manufactured by welding preformed metal panels and other components together, by forming or casting whole sections as one piece, or {{by a combination of}} these techniques. Although this is sometimes also referred to as a monocoque structure, because the car's outer skin and panels are made load-bearing, there are still <b>ribs,</b> <b>bulkheads</b> and box sections to reinforce the body, making the description semi-monocoque more appropriate.|$|R
40|$|The hybrid wing body {{center section}} test article is an {{all-composite}} structure made of crown, floor, keel, <b>bulkhead,</b> and <b>rib</b> panels utilizing the Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS) design concept. The {{primary goal of}} this test article is to prove that PRSEUS components are capable of carrying combined loads that are representative of a hybrid wing body pressure cabin design regime. This paper summarizes the analytical approach, analysis results, and failure predictions of the test article. A global finite element model of composite panels, metallic fittings, mechanical fasteners, and the Combined Loads Test System (COLTS) test fixture was used to conduct linear structural strength and stability analyses to validate the specimen under the most critical combination of bending and pressure loading conditions found in the hybrid wing body pressure cabin. Local detail analyses were also performed at locations with high stress concentrations, at Tee-cap noodle interfaces with surrounding laminates, and at fastener locations with high bearing/bypass loads. Failure predictions for different composite and metallic failure modes were made, and nonlinear analyses were also performed to study the structural response of the test article under combined bending and pressure loading. This large-scale specimen test will be conducted at the COLTS facility at the NASA Langley Research Center...|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} a combination of wood, foam and fiberglass. The main structure is built from sheet foam and covered in fiberglass, as are the fuselage <b>bulkheads,</b> the wing <b>ribs,</b> stabilizers, and the rudder. The fuselage longerons, wing and tail spars, the landing gear mounts, and firewall are all made from Douglas fir, with the spars solid, not laminates. The formers are made from foam, fiberglassed on both sides for strength. All fittings are made from 4130 steel. The landing gear is fabricated from an automotive leaf spring wrapped with 3-inch fiberglass and mounts wheelbarrow wheels. The wheel pants are made from foam, covered in fiberglass and then hollowed out. Its 30.00 ft span wing has no flaps, has a wing area of 140.0 sq ft and folds for ground storage or transportation.

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of the monocoque chassied Lotus 25 during the [...] season, and its dominance {{in the hands of}} Jim Clark during , highlighted the shortcomings of its spaceframe rivals, including the new Cooper T66. To counteract this, urged on by John Cooper, Maddock started to develop Cooper's own monocoque car. Maddock's design not only followed strict monocoque principles, but also included some very advanced composite technology. The outer, stressed skin was, like the Lotus, formed from sheet aluminium. However, to support this skin, rather than using traditional <b>bulkheads</b> and metal <b>ribs,</b> Maddock specified a lining of aviation-grade honeycomb structure aluminium with a fibreglass inner skin, forming a sandwich structured composite. The resulting chassis (sometimes referred to as the Cooper T69) was far stiffer than previous Cooper products, but with variable wall thicknesses and bonded-in fuel cells it was complex to manufacture. With development over runs and limited finances Cooper decided to drop the concept. It would be 16 years until a car using the same technology won the World Championship: the Williams FW07 of [...]|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe vibroacoustic {{behavior}} of a structure excited by a partially space-correlated random pressure fields such as turbulent boundary layers or internal diffuse fields is of great interest for aeronautical or naval applications. Many works {{have been carried out}} for structures such as plates or simple cylinders whereas little attention has been paid on more complex cases. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study this problem for a ribbed cylindrical shell coupled to internal structures. The proposed modeling is based on the combination of two methods developed recently by the authors: the wavenumber-point (k, M) reciprocity technique and the Condensed Transfer Function (CTF) method. The first one estimates the sensitivity functions at point M of the system from its vibratory velocity field induced by a point excitation at M. This velocity field is estimated with the second method. The CTF method is a substructuring approach which consists in coupling a semi-analytical model of a submerged cylindrical shell with Finite Element models of axisymmetric (<b>ribs,</b> <b>bulkheads)</b> and non-axisymmetric (floor partitions, engine foundations) internal frames. A numerical example of a submerged stiffened cylindrical shell excited by random pressure fields will be given and the influence of the internal frames will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{explores the}} use of an approximate energy flow approach to provide a global modelling tool capable of predicting the pattern and level of vibrational energy flow in complex structures. The modelling approach is based on a differential control volume formulation which, by virtue of its simplified nature, describes the flow of mechanical energy within a structural component in a manner analogous to the flow of thermal energy in heat conduction problems. For complex structures the approach can be implemented using existing finite element software through an analogy between the thermal and vibrational systems. Energy flow predictions along simple beam structures, obtained using the energy flow approach, are compared to "exact" analytical solutions and experimental structural intensity measurements on real structures. This provides useful insight into the capabilities and requirements of the approach, such as the quality of model predictions at lower frequencies and the accuracy requirement for modelling parameters. The task of modelling the transmission of vibrational energy in practical engineering structures is complicated by the partial reflection of incident wave energy at structural discontinuities. Methods to account for this effect are discussed and an approach is developed which can be incorporated into the finite element global modelling scheme. This is used to model a complex multiple transmission path structure which illustrates the ability of the approach to form an effective transmission path ranking tool. Finally, the approach is used to build a representative energy flow model of a <b>ribbed</b> <b>bulkhead</b> structure typical of marine applications. A wavenumber measurement technique is used to assess the wave transmission characteristics of this structure which exhibit strong directional dependence. Predictions provided by the energy flow model are in good general agreement with energy flow measurements obtained from the real structure. Throughout these modelling exercises particular attention is paid to the provision of suitable estimates of the parameters (damping, group velocity, power input and transmission efficiency) on which the accuracy of the model predictions rely. This investigation represents a significant contribution to current knowledge regarding {{the use of}} the energy flow approach and its ability to provide representative models of real structures. Although further research is still required, considerable progress has been made and the work documented here provides the framework for a global modelling tool using existing finite element software...|$|R
