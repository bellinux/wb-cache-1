In 2009, however, the all-amateur Smart Gilas team became the country's official representative in international competitions. The PBA's role in forming a national team was thus reduced to sending up reinforcements to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> national squad.|$|E

25|$|By 6 February 1972, {{the militia}} {{garrison}} at Bouamlong had been organized as a regiment—Groupement Mobile 27 (GM 27). Once again, Bouamlong {{served as a}} launch site for a Royalist offensive as they once again tried to interdict Communist logistics. They were {{a key part of}} the diversion that drew 11 Communist battalions from attacking Long Tieng. After withdrawing from the pursuing Communists, GM 27 was scheduled to again take the offensive in Operation Strength II on 6 March. However, reinforcements being flown in to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> attack mutinied. Such reinforcements as did arrive struck south towards toward the Routes 7/71 road junction. By 30 March, GM 27 joined them in their overlook of the highways.|$|E
25|$|Although the Soviet Union did not {{contribute}} directly {{to the development of}} the RLAF, its actions in 1960-1961 had a great influence on RLAF development. In response to an appeal for help from Kong Le, the Soviet Union dedicated 44 transport aircraft to support of the Neutralist forces. Beginning in December 1960, the Soviets flew in military supplies, beginning with a battery of 105mm howitzers. The Russians flew about 1,000 sorties by March 1961 in support of the Neutralists even as they withdrew northward onto the Plaine des Jarres. The Soviet effort included some drops of Kong Le's paratroopers, as well as the provision of three Lisunov Li-2s to his air force. During the same time frame, the Vietnam People's Air Force's 919th Transport Regiment flew 184 resupply sorties from northern Vietnam into Sam Neua. The communist efforts sparked American efforts to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> RLAF.|$|E
25|$|To {{complete}} its assignments, the 82nd Airborne Division {{was divided into}} three forces. Gavin commanded Force A (parachute): the three parachute infantry regiments and support detachments. The drops were scattered by bad weather and German antiaircraft fire over an area {{three to four times}} larger than planned; ironically, this gave the Germans the impression of a much larger force. Two regiments of the division were given the mission of blocking approaches west of the Merderet River, but most of their troops missed their drop zones entirely. The 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment jumped accurately and captured its objective, the town of Sainte-Mère-Église, which proved essential {{to the success of the}} division.The 1st Battalion captured bridges over the Merderet at Manoir de la Fière and Chef-du-Pont. Gavin returned from Chef-du-Pont and withdrew all but a platoon to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> defense at Manoir de la Fière. About 2.2 miles west of Sainte-Mère-Église and 175 yards east of La Fière Bridge, on Route D15, a historical marker indicates the supposed location of Gavin's foxhole.|$|E

Issues arose during the tour, specifically times when members were barely visible due to the lighting.

There he became a protégé of Sir Henry Brackenbury, the new Military Member of the Viceroy’s Council (i.e. equivalent to War Minister for India), who had been Director of Military Intelligence in London and was keen to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> intelligence branch of the Indian army, including mapping the Northwest Frontier.

Van Derveer's brigade arrived from the Kelly Field line to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Union defense. Brig. Gen. Patton Anderson's brigade (Hindman's Division) attempted to assault the hill in the gap between Johnson and Kershaw. Despite all the furious activity on Snodgrass Hill, Longstreet was exerting little direction on the battlefield, enjoying a leisurely lunch of bacon and sweet potatoes with his staff in the rear. Summoned to a meeting with Bragg, Longstreet asked the army commander for reinforcements from Polk's stalled wing, even though he had not committed his own reserve, Preston's division. Bragg was becoming distraught and told Longstreet that the battle was being lost, something Longstreet found inexplicable, considering the success of his assault column. Bragg knew, however, that his success on {{the southern end of the}} battlefield was merely driving his opponents to their escape route to Chattanooga and that the opportunity to destroy the Army of the Cumberland had evaporated. After the repeated delays in the morning's attacks, Bragg had lost confidence in his generals on the right wing, and while denying Longstreet reinforcements told him [...] "There is not a man in the right wing who has any fight in him." ...|$|E
