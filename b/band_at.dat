40|$|This work {{presents}} a FT-Raman study (lambda(0) = 1064 nm) of naturally occurring polyester poly[(R) - 3 -hydroxybutyrate] (PHB) and its copolymer poly[(R) - 3 -hydroxybutyrate-co-(R) - 3 -hydroxyvalerate] (PHBV) with 5, 8 and 12 mol % of HV (hydroxyvalerate). The FT-Raman spectra of films indicate that full width at half {{height of the}} <b>band</b> centered <b>at</b> 1725 cm(- 1) and relative intensity of <b>bands</b> <b>at</b> 1443 and 1458 cm(- 1) can be use to estimate the crystalline degree in film samples. The similarity between Raman spectra of molten PHB and PHBV and theirs CDCl(3) solutions suggested that molten polymers present similar conformation than polymers in solution. Raman data of these samples showed that <b>bands</b> <b>at</b> 1220, 1402, 1725, 2998 and 3009 cm(- 1) are due to crystalline helical structure and the <b>bands</b> <b>at</b> 1453, 1740, 2881, 2938 and 2990 cm(- 1) are originated from disordered domains. It is shown that composition of PHBV samples can be estimated by analyzing {{the ratio of the}} intensity of the <b>bands</b> <b>at</b> 2938 cm(- 1) (nu C-H) and 1740 cm(- 1) (nu C=O) in the spectra of solutions and of <b>bands</b> <b>at</b> 1354 (wCH(2)) and 1740 cm(- 1) (nu C=O) in spectra of molten polymers.

James recalled how the wound caused her to change Scamper's normal conditioning routine, which cost the pair a few go-round wins; but they still managed to win the world championship title with $96,651 in season earnings. In 1993, James and Scamper qualified for the NFR yet again. James also set her sights on a tenth WPRA World Championship title and recalled how anxious she felt under such pressure. She wanted that win so she could retire Scamper undefeated while he was still in his prime.
