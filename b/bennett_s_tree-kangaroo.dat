50|$|The <b>Bennett</b> <b>S.</b> LeBow College of Business traces {{its origins}} to the {{founding}} of the Drexel Institute in 1891 and the establishment of the Business Department in 1896.

50|$|Earlier in {{his career}} he was {{affiliated}} with Brooke Group, a Leveraged buyout firm controlled by <b>Bennett</b> <b>S.</b> LeBow. Investor <b>Bennett</b> <b>S.</b> LeBow acquired control of Western Union through an outside of chapter 11 process that included the concurrent acquisition of the international telex operations of ITT {{as part of a}} complex leveraged recapitalization that was financed by Drexel Burnham and Michael Milken in a process that included many prominent investors who had also attempted to acquire control including Richard Rainwater and Jay Pritzker. LeBow installed Schriesheim at Western Union from 1987 to 1990 as a special adviser to CEO Robert J. Amman to help oversee a strategic, operational and balance sheet restructuring of the company. They executed a strategy of redirecting Western Union from being an asset-based provider of communications services into a provider of consumer-based money transfer financial services. Schriesheim focused his attention on the divestiture of the non-strategic telecommunications assets. Ultimately, LeBow's $25 million investment to acquire control of Western Union in 1987 was rewarded when the company was acquired by First Financial Management in 1993 for $1.15 billion also making Carl Icahn a return of 3 to 4 times his investment in the bonds in the process. First Financial Management was subsequently acquired in 1995 by First Data Corp in a $6.6 billion merger).|$|R
