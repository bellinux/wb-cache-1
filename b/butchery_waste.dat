40|$|Four {{samples of}} {{sediment}} {{and a single}} box of hand-collected bone from excavations at a site adjacent to Ailcy Hill and Priest Lane, Ripon, North Yorkshire, were submitted for an evaluation of their bioarchaeological potential. The few dateable fragments recovered tentatively suggest a range of dates from the pre-conquest to post-medieval periods. One sample was selected for processing but contained only trace amounts of ancient plant and invertebrate remains of no interpretataive value. The small, reasonably preserved, vertebrate assemblage included remains of the main domesticated species, probably representing both domestic and primary <b>butchery</b> <b>waste.</b> The presence of human bone fragments indicates a degree of reworking in two contexts...|$|E
40|$|Organic refuse, such as {{food and}} <b>butchery</b> <b>waste,</b> was {{commonly}} deposited in dumps andpits in medieval towns throughout northern Europe. These deposits of refuse attracted and supponed a diverse communily of scavengers and their predators. The organic refuse {{can be seen as}} a source of energy that maintained food-webs of donor-controlled populations, giving them potentially high population densities, foundercontrolled response to perturbation, and perhaps a strongly stochastic element in determining which species became dominant at any particular location. The red kite is an example of a scavenger which was strongly dependent on refuse deposition, and it is argued that cats in medieval towns may have lived largely as predators within the refuse-supported food-webs...|$|E
40|$|Three {{samples of}} {{sediment}} and three boxes of hand-collected bone from further excavation of deposits at Magistrates ’ Court, Hull, were submitted for {{an evaluation of}} their bioarchaeological potential. The plant and invertebrate assemblages were very similar to many from the previous excavation of this site (HMC 94) and clearly showed potential to contribute to its interpretation. Most of the bone represented domestic/kitchen refuse, with a smaller component of primary <b>butchery</b> <b>waste,</b> which was more apparent in the earlier phases. The assemblage was {{very similar to that}} recovered from the post-medieval deposits excavated in 1994. A proper record should be made of this material for incorporation with that already obtained in the earlier intervention...|$|E
40|$|Lawrence Street, York, during February 2003. Five {{sediment}} {{samples and}} one box of hand-collected bone, recovered from deposits of 1 st century to modern (19 th/ 20 th century), were submitted to PRS for {{an evaluation of}} their bioarchaeological potential. Plant remains preserved by charring were present, often in considerable quantities and in a good state of preservation in three samples associated with an?oven. The presence of grains showing sprouting in all three indicated the contexts all probably represented {{the same kind of}} activity, apparently malting. The two other samples gave useful assemblages of plant remains preserved mainly by anoxic waterlogging. Two samples produced invertebrate remains which, although somewhat decayed and fragile, have the potential to provide a range of information about the features and their surroundings. This would be of very great value since little work has been carried out on biological remains of this date or from the Lawrence Street area of York. The vertebrate assemblage recovered from this site was rather small, although quite well-preserved. Domestic mammals formed the bulk of the identified remains. Refuse representing both <b>butchery</b> and domestic <b>waste</b> was indicated, however, too few fragments were recovered for determining specific disposal patterns. It is recommended that all the material is retained for the present, and that any deposits of a similar kin...|$|R

A daughter of around four years of age holds her younger sibling in her arms. The caption to the slide reads: "Outcast. " This family could come from the "Dalit" or "Untouchable" caste, a group outside the four main castes of Hindu society, and believed to be ritually impure. Dalits were associated with "unclean" occupations, such as leatherwork, <b>butchery,</b> <b>waste</b> disposal and animal carcass disposal. This slide comes from a collection created by missionaries from Regions Beyond Missionary Union, an interdenominational Protestant evangelical mission working in northeast India (Bihar and Orissa) and Nepal...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{sediment}} samples and two boxes of hand-col 1 ected bone, from deposits of 11 th to 14 th century date, revealed by excavations at Wakeman’s House, Ripon, North Yorkshire, were submitted for {{an evaluation of}} their bioarchaeological potential. The few biological remains, other than bone, recovered from the samples were of no interpretative value beyond that given in the text. A small, but well dated assemblage of bones was recovered from the excavations. The bulk of the vertebrate remains, mainly identified as the major domestic species, cattle, caprovids and pigs, were recovered from 11 th/ 12 th century deposits. Skeletal element representation for cattle and caprovids from these deposits suggested the presence of both primary <b>butchery</b> <b>waste</b> and domestic refuse. A squirrel metatarsal may suggest the inclusion of waste from specialist craft activities. Additionally, remains of a sparrowhawk may provide evidence for high status activities such as hawking and hunting. No further investigation of the biological remains (other than bone, and the?charred amorphous organic component of Context 1018) from the sediment samples, is warranted. However, any remaining sediment should be sieved for the recovery of small bones and this material considered in conjunction with any additional study of the hand-collected vertebrate assemblage. A basic archive should be made of all wel...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{sediment}} {{samples and}} two boxes of hand-col 1 ected bone, from deposits of 12 th century to modern date, revealed by excavations at Skellgarths, Ripon, North Yorkshire, were submitted for {{an evaluation of}} their bioarchaeological potential. These deposits have, unusually for sites in Ripon observed {{in the past few}} years, produced some modest (in one case rich) assemblages of plant remains and one assemblage with excellent preservation of invertebrates, and there is clearly potential for further study both of the material in hand and any deposits threatened with destruction by development, to elucidate plant use, human activity and local environmental conditions in this area. A small but well preserved assemblage of animal bone (totalling approximately 40 litres) was recovered. The material came from three separate excavation trenches, with a total of 27 dated bone-bearing contexts. Material in each trench was summarily grouped by period as medieval, post-medieval and modern. A rather limited range of taxa was identified, but there was a high proportion of measurable bones, though these were largely concentrated in one modern context (1009) and appeared to represent specialised <b>butchery</b> <b>waste</b> (probably from an adjacent property which was, until recently, a butcher’s shop). It is recommended that the vertebrate remains should be fully recorded and a biometrical archiv...|$|E
