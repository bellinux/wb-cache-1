500|$|One critic theorized, [...] "...ather than {{end this}} Brazil-ian sci-fi dystopia with the {{equivalent}} of that film's shot of its lobotomized hero, which puts the lie to the immediately previous scene of his imagined liberation, Spielberg tries to pass off exactly the same ending but without the rimshot, {{just to see if}} the audience is paying attention." [...] Film scholars Nigel Morris and Jason P. Vest point to a line in the film as possible evidence of this. After Anderton is captured, Gideon tells him that, [...] "It's actually kind of a rush. They say you have visions. That your life flashes <b>before</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes.</b> That all your dreams come true."*Vest. pg. 135 While Vest considers the blissful dream ending a possibility, he questions why Anderton did not imagine his son as having returned.|$|E

The radioisotope thermoelectric generator was also appropriately used for heat. When his rations begin to run low, Watney builds an improvised garden using Martian soil and the crew's feces as a fertilizer. [...] "We could probably grow something on Mars", said Michael Shara, curator, Department of Astrophysics, Division of Physical Sciences at the American Museum of Natural History. It is also believed that microbial organisms {{have the potential to}} live on Mars. In one scene, the glass face shield on Watney's helmet cracks; as oxygen momentarily drops below the critical level, he quickly patches the helmet with duct tape and avoids suffocation. According to Shara, [...] "As long as the pressure on the inside is around 30 percent, you could hold it together <b>before</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> blow out or you had an embolism." ...|$|E

500|$|After Florida {{came under}} the Kingdom of Great Britain's {{jurisdiction}} in 1763, Quaker father and son naturalists John and William Bartram explored {{the length of the}} river while visiting the southeastern United States from 1765 to 1766. They published journals describing their experiences and the plants and animals they observed. They were charged by King George III to find the source of the river they called the Picolata or San Juan, and measured its widths and depths, taking soil samples as they traveled southward. William returned to Florida from 1773 to 1777 and wrote another journal about his travels, while he collected plants and befriended the Seminoles who called him [...] "Puc Puggy" [...] (flower hunter). William's visit took him as far south as Blue Spring, where he remarked on the crystal clear views offered by the spring water: [...] "The water is perfectly diaphanous, and here are continually a prodigious number and variety of fish; they appear as plain as though lying on a table <b>before</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes,</b> although many feet deep in the water." [...] Bartram's journals attracted the attention of such prominent Americans as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. The success of these journals inspired other naturalists such as André Michaux to further explore the St. Johns, as he did in 1788, sailing from Palatka south to Lake Monroe, and gave names to some of the plants described by the Bartrams' journals. Michaux was followed by William Baldwin between 1811 and 1817. Subsequent explorers, including John James Audubon, have carried William's Travels Through North & South Carolina, Georgia, East & West Florida with them as a guide.|$|E

That is, unlike the insight of the first rank, which can be easily disturbed, the second rank has greater constancy in the face of distractions.

Hakuin describes that at this point one [...] "is neither conversant with the deportment of the bodhisattva, nor does he understand the causal conditions for a Buddha-land.

2500|$|A {{few days}} before Bayonetta release, Japanese gaming {{publication}} Famitsu awarded the Xbox 360 version a perfect 40 out of 40, a relatively rare occurrence that many consider prestigious. The PlayStation 3 version received a slightly lower rating, criticized for its lesser visual quality, frame rate and control problems compared to the Xbox 360 version. Edge awarded the game a score of 10 out of 10, praising the game's combat system for being both deep and based around clear rules which are immediately accessible and well-taught to the player. Edge singled out the upgrade from Normal to Hard difficulties as [...] "where Bayonetta transitions from the great to the legendary," [...] concluding, [...] "it's difficult to recall another third-person actioner that feels so worth mastering." [...] GamesRadar's Nathan Irvine also gave the game 10 out of 10, calling [...] it [...] "nails... the epic scale of everything that unfolds <b>before</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and the manner in}} which it's delivered", believed it was better than God of War Collection, Devil May Cry 4, and Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and praised its [...] "superb action" [...] and humor (such as [...] "Luka doing his best Assassin's Creed impression by looking moody in an Altair/Ezio style hood").

2500|$|Cruyff was {{the most}} famous {{exponent}} {{of the school of}} football known as Total Football (Totaalvoetbal in Dutch) explored by Rinus Michels. Being known as [...] "the total footballer", he {{was also one of the}} brilliant pioneers of the [...] "false nine" [...] position/role in modern football. In Total Football's heyday (in the early 1970s), Cruyff was truly an ‘on-field tactician’, an ‘on-field manager’, or a ‘coach-player’ at the same time, before the concept of player-coach was at the height of its popularity in professional football during the 1980s and 1990s. As Argentina World Cup winner Jorge Valdano said of Cruyff, in an interview with Thomas Goubin of SoFoot.com, “Never in my life have I seen a player like Cruyff rule matches. He was the owner of the show. Much more than his team, the referee or the fans. His grip on what was happening on the field was amazing. He was a player, coach and referee at the same time.”. Chris McMullan (of FootballFanCast.com) writes that “he [...] was an anomaly. A man who played football like no one else. He didn't physically play football after all, he played it with his mind. An esoteric pursuit that completely changed the game. A visionary, a departure, a flight of fancy – Cruyff is the ultimate because his contribution to the game wasn't simply personal. He didn't break records, he didn't win golden boots, and only occasionally dazzled with skills. The reason he is a great is because he understood the game like no one else ever did and probably ever will. (...) His vision, his ability to see the game in a way that no one else could have was his gift. It showcases his talent, the way he formulated the game in his head and then was able to execute it perfectly with his legs.” And he concludes, “There is no one goal, no one clip of football that can encapsulate Johan Cruyff's contribution to football. No one piece of video could ever do that. That's not surprising. Cruyff wasn't a Pele or a Maradona whose careers can be summed up with a series of vines and clips, mountains of goals and skills after another. With Cruyff, you have to think in order to be able to understand it. It doesn't simply happen <b>before</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes,</b> but it's something altogether more thoughtful, and ultimately more rewarding.” ...|$|E
