5000|$|The {{jumping spider}} genus Tullgrenella was named {{in his honor}} by Cândido Firmino de Mello-Leitão. The eponymous [...] "Tullgren funnel" [...] is a {{modified}} <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnel,</b> a device used to extract small insects and arthropods from soil samples.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{extraction}} {{is commonly}} referred to as <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnel</b> or Tullgren funnel. Antonio Berlese described this method of dynamic sampling in 1905 with a hot water jacket as heat source. In 1918 Albert Tullgren described a modification, where the heating came from above by an electric bulb and the heat gradient was increased by an iron sheet drum around the soil sample. Today's extraction funnels of this type usually combine elements from both publications and thus should be referred to as Berlese-Tullgren funnel.|$|E

50|$|The {{nature of}} soil makes direct {{observation}} of food webs difficult. Since soil organisms {{range in size}} from less than 0.1 mm (nematodes) to greater than 2 mm (earthworms) there are many different ways to extract them. Soil samples are often taken using a metal core. Larger macrofauna such as earthworms and insect larva can be removed by hand, but this is impossible for smaller nematodes and soil arthropods. Most methods to extract small organisms are dynamic; they depend on the ability of the organisms {{to move out of the}} soil. For example, a <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnel,</b> used to collect small arthropods, creates a light/heat gradient in the soil sample. As the microarthropods move down, away from the light and heat, they fall through a funnel and into a collection vial. A similar method, the Baermann funnel, is used for nematodes. The Baerman funnel is wet, however (while the <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnel</b> is dry) and does not depend on a light/heat gradient. Nematodes move out of the soil and to the bottom of the funnel because, as they move, they are denser than water and are unable to swim. Soil microbial communities are characterized in many different ways. The activity of microbes can be measured by their respiration and carbon dioxide release. The cellular components of microbes can be extracted from soil and genetically profiled, or microbial biomass can be calculated by weighing the soil before and after fumigation.|$|E
5000|$|A Tullgren funnel, {{also known}} as <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnel</b> or Berlese trap, is an {{apparatus}} used to extract living organisms, particularly arthropods, from samples of soil. The Tullgren funnel works by creating a temperature gradient over the sample such that mobile organisms will {{move away from the}} higher temperatures and fall into a collecting vessel, where they perish and are preserved for examination. The illustration shows how it works: a funnel (E) contains the soil or litter (D), and a heat source (F) such as an electric lamp (G) heats the litter. Animals escaping from the desiccation of the litter descend through a filter (C) into a preservative liquid (A) in a receptacle (B). This illustration is merely a schematic, since usually the soil sample will not be crumbled and poured into the funnel (this would inevitably lead to a high amount of soil particles in the preservation fluid requiring laborious work to sort out the soil organisms). In fact, the soil sample is placed on a mesh sieve that will allow the soil animals to pass but should retain most of the soil particles.|$|E

40|$|A rich {{material}} of Heteroptera extracted with <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnels</b> by Dr. I. Loksa between 1953 – 1974 in Hungary, has been examined. Altogether 157 true bug {{species have been}} identified. The ground-living heteropteran assemblages collected in different plant communities, substrata, phytogeographical provinces and seasons have been compared with multivariate methods. Because of the unequal number of samples, the objects have been standardized with stochastic simulation. There are several true bug species, which have been collected in {{almost all of the}} plant communities. However, characteristic ground-living heteropteran assemblages have been found in numerous Hungarian plant community types. Leaf litter and debris seem to have characteristic bug assemblages. Some differences have also been recognised between the bug fauna of mosses growing on different surfaces. Most of the species have been found in all of the great phytogeographical provinces of Hungary. Most high-dominance species, which have been collected, {{can be found at the}} ground-level almost throughout the year. Specimens of many other species have been collected with <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnels</b> in spring, autumn and/or winter.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the ground-dwelling {{arthropod}} diversity in tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF). Due to unique habitat conditions in TMCFs with continuously wet substrates and a waterlogged forest floor along with the innate biases of the pitfall trap, <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnel</b> and Winkler extractor are certain to make it difficult to choose the most appropriate method to sample the ground-dwelling arthropods in TMCFs. Among the three methods, the Winkler extractor was the most efficient method for quantitative data and pitfall trapping for qualitative data for most groups. Inclusion of floatation method as a complementary method along with the Winkler extractor would enable a comprehensive quantitative survey of ground-dwelling arthropods. Pitfall trapping is essential for both quantitative and qualitative sampling of Diplopoda, Opiliones, Orthoptera, and Diptera. The Winkler extractor was the best quantitative method for Psocoptera, Araneae, Isopoda, and Formicidae; and the <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnel</b> was best for Collembola and Chilopoda.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Four {{sampling}} {{techniques were}} evaluated to estimate clover aphid, Nearctaphis bakeri (Cowen), abundance in red clover {{fields in the}} Willamette Valley. The <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnel</b> method detected one to four times more aphids than other sampling techniques. Visual assessment often underestimated the high aphid densities during the flowering and seeding of clover. Sweep net and Schuh shaker techniques had limitations and underrated the numbers of aphids present in the clover fields. Strong correlations (r² = 0. 74 - 0. 87) {{were found between the}} <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnel</b> technique and visual assessment technique in a 2 nd year established field. Numerical differences in the spatial distribution of N. bakeri on clover stems were shown during various stages of plant development over the season. During development of buds and axils, aphid numbers on {{the lower half of the}} plant averaged 1. 5 times greater than those on the upper half. As the season progressed into the flowering and seeding stage, aphid numbers on the upper stem halves were approximately five times greater than those on the lower half. Winged clover aphids were too few to show definite peaks of flight using water traps, averaging 2. 19 aphids per yellow bucket during the June-August period. No significant differences in aphid attractiveness to the different colors were found among water pan traps.

(Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), {{that attack}} cruciferous vegetables, also attack canola. The aims {{of this study}} were to determine the seasonal phenology of P. xylostella populations on canola, and the composition, relative abundance and seasonal phenology of parasitoids attacking P. xylostella on this crop. Diamondback moth adults were monitored with synthetic sex-pheromone traps. Larval and pupal populations of P. xylostella were monitored weekly for three years at Bapsfontein and Rietondale in Gauteng province. Samples of diamondback moth larvae, pupae and parasitoid cocoons were collected and transported to the laboratory. Parasitoids that emerged were identified and their incidence recorded. <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnel</b> catches were used as an indicator of the accuracy of the visual counts. The infestation level of P. xylostella larvae was high from May to August at Rietondale, while at Bapsfontein it was high from September to December. There was a high correlation (r= 0. 79, P< 0. 001) between pheromone trap catches and subsequent larval infestations at Bapsfontein. The pheromone traps indicated that diamondback moth adults were present throughout the year. <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnel</b> catches indicated {{that a large number of}} larvae, especially first instars, were overlooked during visual plant scouting. Parasitism rates were often very high, reaching 90 – 100 %.

Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus was most abundant; Psychodinae, Cheyletidae and Gamasina were present in numbers high enough to allow ecological consideration. Separate counts were made for living and dead specimens. Populations of D. pteronyssinus were detected throughout the year only in mattresses. In June-July the infestation spread to the bedroom floors where the mieroclimate was then suitable for development; this population died out in October. Livingroom floors were not infested due to the unsuitable microclimate, the absence of food and the distance from the bedrooms. There was a strong correlation between the weather (outdoors and indoors) and the numbers and distribution of D. pteronyssinus within the home. Microorganisms and fibers of plant origin (most likely from the cotton bed sheets) were found frequently in the alimentary canal of these mites. As a site for control of pyroglyphidinfestations in the environment of house dust atopies, mattresses are much more important than living-room floors which have been sampled most frequently in other studies...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of phytoseiid populations was made of two well- cultivated and regularly sprayed apple orchards with two unsprayed orchards in Cache Valley, northern Utah. Two phytoseiid species, Typhlodromus mcgregori Chant and T. occidentalis Nesbitt were observed on the apple leaves, under the bark, and occasionally in the litter and soil. Amblyseius cucumeris (Oudemans) occurred in the soil and litter and occasionally under bark. T. mcgregori was dominant in the unsprayed orchards, and T. occidentalis in the sprayed. Of the phytophagous mites, which served as food for the phytoseiids, the two-spotted mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch was dominant. Other phytophagous mites were the brown mite, Bryobia rubrioculus (Scheuten), the European red mite, Panonychus ulmi (Koch), and the McDaniel mite, Tetranychus mcdanieli McGregor. The study suggests T. mcgregori to be a non-specific, facultative predator of phytophagous mites. T. mcgregori was adversely affected by standard pesticide practices, but T. occiden talis survived in larger numbers. The phytoseiids seem well adjusted to {{the environment of the}} unsprayed orchards and to contribute to the low phytophagous mite populations in those orchards. In the sprayed orchards, the phytoseiids failed to control the high populations of phytophagous mites which developed. No statistical differences were found in the efficiencies of the mite brushing machine and <b>Berlese</b> <b>funnels</b> in removing either phytoseiid or phytophagous mites from apple leaves...|$|R
