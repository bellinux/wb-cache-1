40|$|A {{protective}} cover assembly {{for an end}} of a cable connector having a cable housing that encloses a plurality of connective pins or sockets and that satisfies all requirements for space applications. A connector <b>body</b> <b>flange</b> is formed at the extremity of a cable and is positioned so that it may register with a corresponding connector <b>body</b> <b>flange</b> {{on the end of}} a companion cable to which a connection is to be made, one cable end having cable lead pins and the companion cable end having lead sockets with which the pins register. A latch mechanism having a latch housing is received in the connector <b>body</b> <b>flange</b> and a crank connected to a manually rotatable cap actuates a spring-loaded latch element that is engageable with a connector <b>body</b> <b>flange</b> to secure or to release the cover assembly with the simple twisting motion of the cap, thereby simplifying the task of effecting coupling and decoupling of the cable ends...|$|E
5000|$|It has a long, thin <b>body</b> and a <b>flange</b> at one end, {{resembling}} a T in profile. The flanges of T-nuts often have hooks or serrations on the prongs that dig into a wooden work piece as the bolt is tightened {{from the opposite}} side of the piece, providing better retention.|$|R
50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} innovation since the introduction of double seams is the welded side seam. Prior to the welded side seam, the can body was folded and/or soldered together, leaving a relatively thick side seam. The thick side seam required that the side seam end juncture at the end curl to have more metal to curl around before closing in behind the <b>Body</b> Hook or <b>flange,</b> with a greater opportunity for error.|$|R
50|$|On <b>bodies</b> with a <b>flange</b> focal {{distance}} {{greater than that}} of M42, most notably Nikon, three options are available. A simple mechanical adaptor allows the lens to be mounted, but the effect is similar to the introduction of an extension tube, reducing the minimum focus distance at the expense of losing infinity focus. Alternatively, an adaptor with an optical element can be used to retain the original focus range of the lens, at the expense of some image quality. Finally, it is possible to replace the M42 mount on some lenses with the desired camera mount, or to perform the reverse change on a camera body.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{simplicity}} of the M42 lens mount and the large selection of lenses, M42 adaptors exist for all current and many obsolete lens mounts. The adaptor fits between the camera and the lens, making it possible to mate an M42 lens to a body with a different lens mount. M42 adaptors work best on <b>bodies</b> with a <b>flange</b> depth {{less than or equal to}} the M42's flange depth, which includes the popular Canon EF-mount, the Pentax K-mount, the Minolta/Konica Minolta/Sony A-mount, the Sony E-mount, the Samsung NX-mount, the Fujifilm X-mount and the Four Thirds System including the Micro Four Thirds system. This allows the lens to be physically mounted the correct distance from the film or sensor, retaining the original focus range of the lens without the use of correction optics.|$|R
40|$|A {{saddle clamp}} {{assembly}} is presented. The assembly {{is comprised of}} a hollow cylindrical body centered about a longitudinal axis and being diametrically split into semicircular top and bottom sections. Each section has a pair of connection flanges, at opposite ends, that project radially outward. A pair of bolts are retained on the top section flanges and are threadable into nuts retained on the bottom section flanges. A base member is anchored to a central underside portion of the bottom clamp body section and has a pair of connection tabs positioned beneath the bottom clamp <b>body</b> section connection <b>flanges</b> {{on opposite sides of}} the clamp axis. A pair of bolts are retained on the base member connection tabs and are threadable into a pair of nuts retainable on a support structure. The connection tab and connection flanges on each side of the clamp body are axially offset in a manner permitting downward installation/removable tool access to the lower bolts past the connection flanges. An elongated retention tether is used to connect the top clamp body section to the balance of the clamp assembly. This prevents loss of the top clamp body section when it is removed from the bottom clamp body section...|$|R
40|$|As the {{offshore}} wind power tends to locate farther from the coast for efficient generation of electricity, the interest of foundation systems of which construction sequence is economical and convenient under deep water circumstance is increasing. Mooring anchor system has been utilized {{as one of the}} most popular ways for anchoring of vessels or floating structures, and various types of anchor and mooring system have been investigated for large structures under diverse loading condition. In this paper, the pullout behavior of the modified embedded suction anchor (ESA) is studied using numerical analysis. The behavior of the embedded suction anchor is simulated using finite element method, and Adaptive Meshing (AM) technique approach incorporated in Abaqus/Explicit is applied to simulate the large deformation of soil caused by continuous pullout of anchor. The three dimensional modeling is performed to duplicate the round <b>body</b> shape with <b>flanges</b> of the embedded suction anchor. The anchor is assumed as rigid body and clay is considered as a linear elastic-perfectly plastic soil model with a Tresca yield criterion. The pullout capacities after different initial rotations show similar results with the maximum horizontal pullout capacity and the load inclination of 30 ?? or 40 ?? at the bottom point of the ESA has an advantage in that reduced pullout load can rotate the ESA...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{integrity}} {{assessment of}} reactor vessel internals {{should be conducted}} in the design process to secure the safety of nuclear power plants. Various loads such as self-weight, seismic load, flow-induced load, and preload are applied to the internals. Therefore, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code, Section III, defines the stress limit for reactor vessel internals. The present study focused on structural response analyses of the upper guide structure upper flange. The distributions of the stress intensity in the <b>flange</b> <b>body</b> were analyzed under various design load cases during normal operation. The allowable stress intensities along the expected sections of stress concentration were derived {{from the results of}} the finite element analysis for evaluating the structural integrity of the flange design. Furthermore, seismic analyses of the upper flange were performed to identify dynamic behavior with respect to the seismic and impact input. The mode superposition and full transient methods were used to perform time–history analyses, and the displacement {{at the lower end of}} the flange was obtained. The effect of the damping ratio on the response of the flange was also evaluated, and the acceleration was obtained. The results of elastic and seismic analyses in this study will be used as basic information to judge whether a flange design meets the acceptance criteria...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum seals {{are very}} {{important}} to ensure that the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Linac has an optimum vacuum system. The vacuum joints between flanges must have reliable seals to minimize the leak rate and meet vacuum and electrical requirements. In addition, it is desirable to simplify the installation and thereby also simplify the maintenance required. This report summarizes an investigation of the metal vacuum seals that include the metal C-seal, Energized Spring seal, Helcoflex Copper Delta seal, Aluminum Delta seal, delta seal with limiting ring, and the prototype of the copper diamond seals. The report also contains the material certifications, design, finite element analysis, and testing for all of these seals. It is a valuable reference for any vacuum system design. To evaluate the suitability of several types of metal seals for use in the SNS Linac and to determine the torque applied on the bolts, a series of vacuum leak rate tests on the metal seals have been completed at Los Alamos Laboratory. A copper plated flange, using the same type of delta seal that was used for testing with the stainless steel flange, has also been studied and tested. A vacuum seal is desired that requires significantly less loading than a standard ConFlat flange with a copper gasket for the coupling cavity assembly. To save the intersegment space the authors use thinner flanges in the design. The leak rate of the thin ConFlat flange with a copper gasket is a baseline for the vacuum test on all seals and thin flanges. A finite element analysis of a long coupling cavity flange with a copper delta seal has been performed in order to confirm the design of the long coupling cavity flange and the welded area of a cavity <b>body</b> with the <b>flange.</b> This analysis is also necessary to predict a potential deformation of the cavity under the combined force of atmospheric pressure and the seating load of the seal. Modeling of this assembly has been achieved using both HKS/Abaqus and COSMOS/M, which are finite element packages for analysis of coupled, nonlinear problems. From these studies, the appropriate seals that are reliable for SNS long coupling cavities and beamline joints were determined...|$|R
40|$|Masters of ScienceNampak {{packages}} {{millions of}} cans {{a year and}} {{a very small percentage of}} these cans fail due to many reasons. One of the main reasons that cause 2 - piece food cans to fail is split flanges. Split Flanges arises due to a number of reasons which will be discussed in detail. The focus of this thesis was based on the causes of split flanges in 2 -piece food cans. A study on manufacturing the steel and can making together with packaging fish in these cans was conducted. Another study on the reasons for split flanges occurring in 2 piece cans was conducted done as well. The purpose of the investigation was to check if hydrogen embrittlement could be the cause for split bodies forming in 2 piece food cans. 2 piece cans are drawn and wall ironed from tinplate; the cans were made up of a top and a shaped body. It was this shaped body that went through a considerable amount of stress during manufacture especially at the top of the can, which gave an explanation to why the cans split at the curved area near the flange of the can. According to previous studies done at Nampak R&D more complaints about split bodies were coming from the Fish canneries on the West Coast than the Vegetable canneries. These canneries used the exact same cans to package their product. The difference between the processes at these canneries was the exhaust boxes at the fish canneries. The exhaust box is a long tunnel filled with steam used to precook the fish; the vegetables are not precooked in exhaust boxes. Non metallic inclusions (NMI) was one of the main reason for these split flanges to occur and a reason of particular interest in this research. NMI’s were distributed throughout the steel of the cans and since the same cans were used for the fish and vegetable canneries, they should be failing at the same rate. Yet only complaints came from the fish canneries. So the primary focus of the research was to check if the additional steam process contributed to the formation of split <b>bodies</b> / <b>flanges.</b> We proposed to investigate if hydrogen atoms collect at grain boundaries, vacancies and non metallic inclusions and also to check if the steam accelerated embrittlement. Hydrogen is believed to penetrate right into the bare steel of the cans that were exposed to steam. Hydrogen atoms are being investigated because of their small size, their ability to diffuse through a metal lattice and form hydrogen molecules within the intermetallic vacancies of the metal. The molecules of hydrogen, once formed within the internal structure of the metal, remain trapped because of their larger size and can generate a significant pressure that can contribute to the formation of split bodies. [1] The first step to prove whether H-embrittlement was present in the cans was to check if hydrogen was present. A spectroscopic method namely, elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) was used to check if H could be detected using the Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis technique. Several experiments were designed to make sure the technique was suitable for the detection of H. Even though it is known that all metals are susceptible to corrosion and Hembrittlement, the tinplate metals had to be checked in an environment similar to the exhaust box (suspected area causing hydrogen embrittlement) in the factories. Further characterization was done using X-Ray Diffraction to measure the residual stress and relate it to the effects of H-embrittlement. If the H had penetrated into the metal it would cause some distortion in the atomic distances between the atomic planes in Fe atoms and can be measured using XRD. Another effect of hydrogen embrittlement is to reduce the strength in the metal. Tensile tests were performed to measure the strengths of the metal...|$|R
