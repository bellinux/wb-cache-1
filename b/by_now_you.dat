25|$|The Clive Davis's pre-Grammy {{party that}} Houston was {{expected}} to attend, which featured many {{of the biggest names}} in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start: <b>By</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.|$|E
500|$|After Harrison {{has named}} Rolling Stone {{as the main}} {{perpetrator}} of his anguish, Leng suggests that {{he is unable to}} sustain the previous [...] "artifice", whereby the lyrics' shift in perspective from first-person to third-person represented the apparently [...] "happy" [...] private man versus the [...] "wounded" [...] musician, as [...] "personified by his guitar". Instead, Harrison [...] "flays his detractors" [...] in the song's subsequent verses. These final verses contain the rhyming couplets [...] "Thought <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> knew the score / You missed the point just like before" [...] and [...] "While you attack, create offence / I'll put it down to your ignorance". Music critic Lindsay Planer describes the lines as [...] "suggesting that there is more to Harrison's music than is being taken into consideration by narrow-minded journalists".|$|E
2500|$|The Nazis on the {{one hand}} would jam {{transmissions}} from the Allies' stations, {{but on the other hand}} would also copy them. The band Charlie and His Orchestra is considered as a negative example, also called Mr. Goebbels Jazz Band. Several of Germany’s most talented swing musicians, such as saxophonist Lutz Templin and vocalist Karl “Charlie” Schwedler, were active in a Jazz band. Here the Nazis replaced the original texts with their own provocative propaganda texts that were pro-Nazi and anti-American/British. For example, the lyrics for “Little Sir Echo” has anti-American/British appeal with lyrics such as “German U-boats are making you sore, You’re always licked, not a victory came through…You’re nice, little fellow, but <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> should know that you can never win this war!” [...] Goebbels’ propaganda was broadcast over pirated short-wave frequencies into America, Britain, and Canada in order to spread fear and weaken the morale of Germany’s enemies (WFMU Staff).|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll stay <b>by</b> <b>you,</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> are down," [...] said Dick sympathetically. [...] "We are not brutes, {{even though}} we haven't any great love for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And how terribly galling it all is, when {{we could}} have had that man under the {{guillotine}} <b>by</b> <b>now,</b> if <b>you</b> had not blundered so terribly last year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, but I'm {{a little}} {{doubtful}} of going in upon them <b>by</b> myself; <b>now,</b> <b>you</b> {{are well known}} to them all, {{and it will be}} no detriment to you just to let me go in with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You couldn't help that," [...] said Bickley, [...] "seeing {{that if you}} had stopped, <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> {{would have}} been {{wandering}} in religious light." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You should {{thank the}} God you believe in," [...] he said, [...] "that <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> are not stiff indeed--all that the jackals have left of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{remember}} right it came {{some time}} ago, Heer Adrian," [...] she replied with sarcasm. [...] "I thought that <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> had {{forgotten all about}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Agatha {{looked at}} her in evident bewilderment, but she nodded. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "of course, I knew it would come. Everybody knows <b>by</b> <b>now</b> that <b>you</b> have fallen out with Gregory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had been}} dead <b>by</b> <b>now</b> if <b>you</b> had, Messer Gonzaga. But you thought so, and I may take leave {{to show you how}} bold a man it needs to think so without suffering." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes, <b>by</b> Jove, <b>now</b> <b>you</b> mention it, there was. An even fiver. And--er--by the way, old man--the fact is, {{just for}} the moment, I'm frightfully--You haven't {{such a thing as}} a fiver {{anywhere}} about, have you? The fact is--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{speaks the}} man I loved," [...] said Irene. [...] "What perverse fate kept us apart, Olaf? Had you taken what I offered, <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> and I would have ruled the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have heard}} of you, Monsieur de Garnache," [...] said the youth as he crossed his shapely legs of silken violet, and fingered the great pearl that {{depended}} from his ear. [...] "But we had thought that <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> would be {{on your way to}} Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of a {{certainty}} {{you should be}} proud who with a few have defeated so many. Still, had I not been ordered to come at speed, I think that <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> would have been as those are," [...] and he looked towards the dead Zulus who were laid out at a distance like men asleep, while their companions sought {{for a place to}} bury them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I were in {{your place}} I should have tried a hundred things <b>by</b> <b>now,</b> but <b>you</b> always have some silly objection. Why couldn't you, for instance, have taken on the agency of that what-d'you-call-it car?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! And I {{suppose that}} <b>by</b> ESPECIALLY <b>NOW,</b> <b>you</b> mean Kendricks," [...] I said, and I laughed mockingly, as the novelists say. [...] "How sick I am of this stale old love-business between young people! We {{ought to know}} better--we're old enough; at least YOU are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can bear}} no more," [...] she said, with a {{downward}} {{glance at the}} long black dress. [...] "Have you forgotten? You have shown me what a man can rise to, Harry Alton, but I will not wrong you further <b>by</b> marrying <b>you.</b> <b>Now</b> <b>you</b> must say nothing, but out of pity for me go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This has chanced to you, King: {{that evil}} which I prophesied {{to you if}} you refused to listen to the voice of mercy has fallen upon you. <b>By</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> would have been dead, had it not pleased Him Whom I serve, working through me, His messenger, to bring you back to look upon the sun. Thank Him, therefore, and worship Him, for He alone is Master of the Earth," [...] and he held the {{crucifix}} before his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "For thirty years," [...] he said, [...] "I've sailed {{the seas}} and seen good and bad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, {{provisions}} running out, knives going, and what not. Well, now I tell you, I never seen good come o' goodness yet. Him as strikes first is my fancy; dead men don't bite; them's my views--amen, so be it. And now, you look here," [...] he added, suddenly changing his tone, [...] "we've had about {{enough of this}} foolery. The tide's made good enough <b>by</b> <b>now.</b> <b>You</b> just take my orders, Cap'n Hawkins, and we'll sail slap in {{and be done with}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The sponges, Steward," [...] said Cuticle, for {{the last}} time taking out his teeth, and drawing up his shirt sleeves still further. Then, taking the patient by the wrist, [...] "Stand <b>by,</b> <b>now,</b> <b>you</b> mess-mates; keep hold of his arms; pin him down. Steward, put your hand on the artery; I shall {{commence}} as soon as his pulse begins to--now, now!" [...] Letting fall the wrist, feeling the thigh carefully, and bowing over it an instant, he drew the fatal knife unerringly across the flesh. As it first touched the part, the row of surgeons simultaneously dropped their eyes to the watches in their hands while the patient lay, with eyes horribly distended, in a kind of waking trance. Not a breath was heard; but as the quivering flesh parted in a long, lingering gash, a spring of blood welled up between the living walls of the wounds, and two thick streams, in opposite directions, coursed down the thigh. The sponges were instantly dipped in the purple pool; every face present was pinched to a point with suspense; the limb writhed; the man shrieked; his mess-mates pinioned him; while round and round the leg went the unpitying cut.|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend Basil Grant," [...] I said, [...] "is {{the best}} man we can go to. He and I were to {{have gone to the}} same dinner tonight; but he will just have come back <b>by</b> <b>now.</b> Have <b>you</b> any {{objection}} to taking a cab?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Augusta. I {{have done}} my best <b>by</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>now</b> <b>you</b> must guard yourself. We part for ever. I go hence to finish where I began. My birthplace calls me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tell {{me about}} yourself. You {{know all about}} me, <b>by</b> <b>now.</b> What do <b>you</b> do besides {{brightening}} up the dull evenings of poor devils of bank-clerks?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd be {{just that}} colour in the sunset," [...] she said, thus {{bringing}} {{him back to}} the subject, [...] "and if you looked at the ground you'd find {{there was a sense of}} warm gold fire in it, and once you'd perceived the colour, it would strengthen till you'd see nothing else. You are blind; you are only half-born; you are gross with good living and heavy sleeping. You are a piano which will only play a dozen common notes. Sunset is nothing to you—it merely happens anywhere. Oh, but you make me feel as if I'd like to make you suffer. If you'd ever been sick; if you'd ever been born into a home where there was something oppressed you, and you couldn't understand; if ever you'd believed, or even doubted, you might have been a man <b>by</b> <b>now.</b> <b>You</b> never grow up, like bulbs which spend all summer getting fat and fleshy, but never wakening the germ of a flower. As for me, the flower is born in me, but it wants bringing forth. Things don't flower if they're overfed. You have to suffer before you blossom in this life. When death is just touching a plant, it forces it into a passion of flowering. You wonder how I have touched death. You don't know. There's always a sense of death in this home. I believe my mother hated my father before I was born. That was death in her veins for me before I was born. It makes a difference——" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unhappy, pent-up, ineffectual thing!" [...] he said, {{waving his}} jilted bread and butter, and {{addressing}} the discarded inedible. [...] "Poor old maid among eggs! And {{so it has}} come to this absolute failure with you. Why were you ever laid? Surely, since you were once alive, some lurking aspiration, some lowly, and yet not lowly, but most divine, striving towards the Higher and the Better, hath stirred within you. The warm sunlight shone through your translucent shell, the sweet air stirred the sweet hay of the nest, and life called you from your dreaming to awake, and join it in its interplay. And now! You might have been--what might you not have been? A prize hen, fountain of a broadening stream of hens, chicks, dozens of chicks, hundreds of chicks, a surging ocean of chickens. Had you been hatched among the early Victorian chickens that were, I presume, your contemporaries, <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>you</b> might have been a million fowl, and the delight and support {{of hundreds of thousands of}} homes. You might have been worth thousands of pounds and have eaten corn by the ton. They might have written articles about you in half-crown reviews and devoted poultry farms to your sole support. And instead you have been narrowed down to this sordid back-street tragedy, a mere offence, tempting a struggling tradesman to risk the honour of my patronage of his books, for a paltry fraction of a pennyworth of profit. Why, I ask you, were you not hatched? Was it lack of courage? a fear of the unknown dangers that lie outside the shell? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it. Why {{should you}} feel embarrassed? He must have {{realised}} <b>by</b> <b>now</b> that <b>you</b> acted in the only possible way. It was absurd his ever expecting you to marry him. I mean to say, {{just look at it}} dispassionately ... Eustace ... poor old Eustace ... and you! The Princess and the Swineherd!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to hear}} {{anything}} about it," [...] said Sir Thomas. [...] "Let bygones be bygones. Your aunt, I am sure, never meant unkindly <b>by</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Now,</b> I want <b>you</b> to listen to me." ...|$|R

50|$|Relatively short-lived, The Wizard of Odds {{replaced}} Sale of the Century at 11:00 AM Eastern (10:00 Central). The show did {{not perform}} well against CBS' Gambit (later replaced <b>by</b> <b>Now</b> <b>You</b> See It) and NBC dropped it after less than a year.|$|E
5000|$|On March 19, 1970, Bower {{publicly}} {{announced his}} official retirement — {{four months after}} his 45th birthday. When asked, {{in light of his}} retirement, if he might reveal his true age, he replied [...] "If you don't know <b>by</b> <b>now,</b> <b>you</b> never will". He subsequently revealed his birth date as November 8, 1924.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{nonsense}} you talk, Nat," [...] {{his eldest}} sister Mary said. [...] "I thought <b>by</b> this time, <b>now</b> <b>you</b> are a lieutenant, {{you would have}} become quite stiff, and would expect {{a good deal of}} deference to be paid to you." ...|$|R
