5|$|Among P. labiata {{and some}} other Portias, when adults {{of the same species}} but {{opposite}} sexes recognise each other, they display at 10 to 30centimetres. Males usually wait for 2 to 15minutes before starting a display, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> a female starts a display first.|$|E
5|$|In {{another study}} done at Nosy Mangabe on {{black-and-white}} ruffed lemurs a fourth level or organization was defined: affiliates. Affiliates were individuals with more persistent social bonds and more frequent interactions, usually within a core group, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> also between core groups within a subgroup. Adult females typically had many affiliates, whereas adult males rarely interacted with conspecifics, living a more solitary existence.|$|E

5|$|The Glamorgan sausage is a Welsh {{vegetarian}} sausage. It {{contains no}} meat or skin, instead {{it is made}} with cheese, generally Caerphilly, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> cheddar, along with leek or spring onion. This mixture is then coated in breadcrumbs and rolled into a sausage shape before cooking. Glamorgan sausages date back to at least the early 19th century, {{at which point the}} sausages would have contained pork fat.|$|E

5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E
5|$|Amplexus {{between the}} male and female occurs mainly in water, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> at {{substantial}} distances away on dry land. Observations of breeding sites have shown the males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females near their armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, but there have been reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will not result in eggs being laid.|$|E

5|$|As {{the series}} progressed, some critics began to express {{frustration}} with the comic. Joey Smith, also with Inside Pulse, found the large cast was difficult to track by the fourth issue. In a review of issue 33, Fulton found the series entertaining, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> thought the plot felt directionless. Not all agreed, however; Paste Magazine included the comic book in its list of favorite horror comics in late 2016.|$|E
5|$|Birds need {{to alter}} their {{metabolism}} {{to meet the demands}} of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E
5|$|Doctors {{initially}} told Kennedy {{the tumor}} was inoperable, but he looked around for other opinions and decided on the most aggressive and exhausting course of treatment possible. On June 2, 2008, Kennedy underwent brain surgery at Duke University Medical Center {{in an attempt to}} remove as much of the tumor as possible. The 3½-hour operation, conducted by Dr. Allan Friedman while Kennedy was conscious to minimize any permanent neurological effects, was deemed successful in its goals. Kennedy left the hospital a week later to begin a course of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Opinions varied regarding Kennedy's prognosis: the surgery typically only extended survival time by a matter of months, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> people lived for years.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Stafford {{said there}} were good and bad points to working closely with Weston. His {{knowledge}} of her {{made it easy for}} him to arrange her music, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because he knew she was capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she thought her voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was in the bath {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness. This category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{also includes the}} less severe locked-in syndrome and more severe chronic coma. Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research. Finally, brain death results in an irreversible disruption of consciousness. While other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration (e.g., dementia and delirium) or transient interruption (e.g., grand mal and petit mal seizures) of consciousness, they {{are not included in}} this category.|$|E
5|$|Mosaics {{are among}} the most {{enduring}} of Roman decorative arts, and are found on the surfaces of floors and other architectural features such as walls, vaulted ceilings, and columns. The most common form is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (tesserae) of materials such as stone and glass. Mosaics were usually crafted on site, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> assembled and shipped as ready-made panels. A mosaic workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.|$|E
