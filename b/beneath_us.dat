And any one standing on the moon, when it and the sun are both <b>beneath</b> <b>us,</b> would see this our earth and the element of water upon it just as we see the moon, and the earth would light it as it lights us.|$|E
2500|$|Author Robert Lacey {{quotes a}} fatwa by bin Baz urging caution towards {{claims that the}} Americans had landed on the moon. [...] "We must make careful checks {{whenever}} the kuffar [...] or faseqoon [...] tell us something: we cannot believe or disbelieve them until we get sufficient proof on which the Muslims can depend." [...] Lacey states that [...] "after extensive research" [...] of bin Baz's fatawa, he (Lacey) had only {{been able to find}} this one fatwa on the subject, and no statement in it that the earth was flat. Lacey does however say that according to his source, Bin Baz gave an interview after publishing the article [...] "in which he mused on how we operate day to day on the basis that the ground <b>beneath</b> <b>us</b> is flat ... and it led him to the belief that he was not afraid to voice and for which he became notorious." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ride through}} the dreary tunnel with the dark waters of the canal <b>beneath</b> <b>us,</b> and an {{insecure}} chalk roof above our heads, enlivened as it is by occasional shrieks from the engine's vaporous lungs, and the unceasing rattle of the train, is apt to make one feel somewhat nervous; and the first glimpse of bright daylight that breaks upon us, relieves us from a natural anxiety as to the chances we run of being crushed {{by the fall of}} some twenty tons of chalk from above, or being precipitated into twenty feet of water beneath, with the doors of the carriages locked and no [...] "Nautilus belt" [...] around our waists and not even a child's caul in our pocket. This relief is however temporary, for the light only breaks in through a gap in the tunnel, and some more experienced traveller informs us we are only half out of it. However, our journey is brought to a close without any accident: and we embark on the steamer that is to deposit us at Chatham.|$|E

"It {{was inside}} the {{sleeping}} bag that the 56-year-old detainee took his last breath through broken ribs, {{lying on the floor}} <b>beneath</b> a <b>U.S.</b> soldier in Interrogation Room 6 in the western Iraqi desert.

2500|$|The {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} the San Fernando Valley about 20 miles (31km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Although given the name [...] "Northridge", the epicenter was located {{in the community of}} Reseda; it took several days to pinpoint the epicenter in detail (both communities are neighborhoods of the City of Los Angeles). This was the first instance with a hypocenter directly <b>beneath</b> a <b>U.S.</b> city since the 1933 Long Beach earthquake.|$|R
50|$|The Port Authority {{opened a}} spur to Penn Park station in 1988, {{to link the}} 1985 {{downtown}} subway to the East Busway. However, the line was difficult to integrate into other services, since it used a portion of an old single-tracked former Pennsylvania Railroad tunnel. This tunnel travels <b>beneath</b> the <b>US</b> Steel Tower, and the building's structural supports are {{on each side of}} the tunnel, prohibiting the installation of a second track. The station is still listed as part of the Red Line subway service, but it has had no regular service since 1993.|$|R

50|$|Octavia Boulevard (designated as Octavia Street {{north of}} Hayes Street) {{is a major}} street in San Francisco, California that {{replaced}} the Hayes Valley portion of the damaged two-level Central Freeway.

This section of the trail passes alongside Levi's Stadium and the Ulistac Natural Area and connects with the Highway 237 Bikeway.|$|R
60|$|We {{looked at}} the water glimmering in the crater <b>beneath</b> <b>us</b> {{on the edge of}} which we sat. We looked at heaven above in which the great moon sailed royally. Then we looked into each other's eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much farther," [...] I said. [...] "I am {{sure there}} is firm ground <b>beneath</b> <b>us,</b> {{but it will not}} do to move. If we should fall down, we {{might not be able to}} get up again." ...|$|E
60|$|Following the {{direction}} of his gesture, I turned and looked down upon the camp in the plain <b>beneath</b> <b>us.</b> In spite of the fifteen miles, one could in that clear atmosphere see every detail with the utmost distinctness.|$|E
50|$|FM 1776 {{begins at}} I-10 Exit 248 as a northward {{extension}} of the US 67 roadway which approaches from the southwest from Alpine and merges with I-10. The two-lane road continues to the north <b>beneath</b> the <b>US</b> 285 underpass and reaches Coyanosa. North of Coyanosa, FM 1776 joins and follows FM 1450 for a half-mile (0.8 km) stretch southeast {{of the city of}} Pecos before turning off to the northeast. The road then leaves Pecos County at the Pecos River and crosses into Ward County where it intersects FM 1927 south of Pyote. The road then proceeds to the northeast crossing FM 1219 between Royalty and Wickett before terminating at SH 18 approximately 8 mi south of Monahans.|$|R
60|$|Look, look, brave Sol doth peep up from <b>beneath,</b> Shows <b>us</b> {{his golden}} face, doth on us breathe; He also doth compass us round with glories, Whilst he ascends {{up to his}} highest stories. Where he his banner over us displays, And gives us light to see our works and ways. Nor are we now, as at the peep of light, To question, is it day, or is it night? The night is gone, the shadows fled away, And we now most sure are that it is day. Our eyes behold it, and our hearts believe it; Nor can the wit of man in this deceive it. And thus it is when Jesus shows his face, And doth assure us of his love and grace.|$|R
60|$|Then we rode on, {{but when}} we had gone {{a hundred and fifty}} yards or so, we turned and {{perceived}} her still sitting on her horse at the same spot, and looking out after <b>us</b> <b>beneath</b> her hand, {{and that was the last}} we saw of her. About a mile farther on, however, we heard galloping behind us, and looking round, saw a mounted soldier coming towards us, leading Nyleptha's matchless steed -- Daylight.|$|R
6000|$|... "A good {{journey to}} you, Monsieur Cue. We may meet on the road, until which time I take my departure. The day may come, when we shall {{converse}} with a rolling sea <b>beneath</b> <b>us.</b> Till then, brave cheer!" ...|$|E
60|$|Presently the sun rose, and I {{saw that}} <b>beneath</b> <b>us</b> {{was a great}} stretch of plain covered with mist, and to the north, on our right, several denser billows of mist that marked {{the course of the}} Crocodile River.|$|E

5000|$|Matt Truman's Variety's {{review of}} the March 2015 {{production}} at the National Theatre in London believes that the music in the production is executed well with the play.

[...] Truman states, [...] "Holcroft not only ridicules our perfectionist culture, but shows the neurosis <b>beneath</b> and lets <b>us</b> feel the stress of its feedback loop ourselves." ...|$|R
60|$|Queen of Beauty {{rose and}} went to her chamber, from which she fetched a knife with some Hebrew words engraven on the blade. She then desired the Sultan, {{the chief of the}} eunuchs, the little slave, and myself to descend into a secret court of the palace, and placed <b>us</b> <b>beneath</b> a gallery which ran all round, she herself {{standing}} in the centre of the court. Here she traced a large circle and in it wrote several words in Arab characters.|$|R
