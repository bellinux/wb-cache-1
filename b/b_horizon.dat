50|$|Podzolic soils occupy about 1 429 000 km2 (15.6%) of Canada's {{land area}} and are {{dominant}} in vast {{areas of the}} humid Appalachian and Canadian Shield regions and in the humid coastal region of British Columbia. They are divided among 3 great groups {{on the basis of}} the kind of Podzolic <b>B</b> <b>horizon.</b> Humic Podzols have a dark <b>B</b> <b>horizon</b> with a low iron content. They occur mainly in wet sites under humid climates and are much less common than other Podzolic soils.|$|E
50|$|These acid soils have a <b>B</b> <b>horizon</b> {{containing}} accumulations of amorphous materials {{composed of}} humified organic matter associated with aluminum and iron. They develop most commonly in sandy materials {{in areas of}} cold, humid climate under forest or shrub vegetation. Water moving downward through the relatively porous material leaches out basic elements (e.g., calcium), and acidic conditions develop. Soluble organic substances formed by decomposition of the forest litter attack soil minerals in surface horizons, {{and much of the}} iron and aluminum released combines with this organic material. When the proportion of aluminum and iron to organic matter reaches a critical level, the organic complex becomes insoluble and is deposited in the <b>B</b> <b>horizon.</b> Dissolved aluminum and iron may also move downward in inorganic forms and be deposited as aluminum-silicon complexes and iron oxides. An Ae (light grey, strongly leached) horizon usually overlies the Podzolic <b>B</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ferro-Humic Podzols have a dark reddish-brown {{or black}} <b>B</b> <b>horizon</b> {{containing}} at least 5% organic carbon and appreciable amounts (often 2% or more) of aluminum and iron in organic complexes. They occur commonly {{in the more}} humid parts of the area of Podzolic soils; e.g., coastal British Columbia and parts of Newfoundland and southern Quebec. In Labrador along the Churchill River valley Ferro-Humic Podzols comprise about 36% of soils. Humo-Ferric Podzols, the most common Podzolic soils in Canada, have a reddish-brown <b>B</b> <b>horizon</b> containing less than 5% organic carbon associated with aluminum and iron complexes.|$|E
40|$|The <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> of {{terra rossa}} soils {{developed}} on three different carbonate lithologies having variable insoluble residue contents were studied in Western Herzegovina. Comparison of  their composition and properties illustrates {{to what extent}} mineral (especially clay mineral assemblage) and particle size composition of those horizons and the insoluble residue of the underlying carbonate rocks {{can be used as}} indicators of the polygenetic nature of terra rossa in this region. Terra rossa <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> have characteristic red colours, neutral to slightly acid pH, high base saturation with calcium as the predominant cation and high CIA (Chemical Index of Alteration). The CIA values obtained are generally in accordance with mineral composition and particle size distribution of the analysed <b>B</b> <b>horizons.</b>  The predominant clay mineral phases in <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> and related insoluble residues match. Kaolinite is the predominant clay mineral phase in the <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> overlying carbonate rocks containing low amounts of insoluble residue, while smectite predominates in calcarenites areas with a high insoluble residue content.  However, the presence of plagioclase, gibbsite, chlorite-vermiculite mixed layer mineral and vermiculite in <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> overlying carbonate rocks containing low amounts of insoluble residue support a polygenetic origin for the terra rossa. In contrast, terra rossa formed on calcarenites containing high amounts of insoluble residue might have formed almost exclusively from the parent carbonate rock although some influence of external materials (e. g. gibbsite) cannot be excluded. This investigation shows that in Western Herzegovina, an area with no important aeolian input, the content and mineral composition of carbonate rock insoluble residue {{plays a major role in}} terra rossa composition.  We can tentatively conclude that the lower the insoluble residue content of the parent materials, the greater is the expectation of a more polygenetic origin for the terra rossa...|$|R
40|$|Sulfate {{adsorption}} {{capacity of}} B-horizons of base-poor, predominantly stagnopodzol, soils from the Plynlimon catchments, mid-Wales {{was determined by}} combination of laboratory adsorption and desorption isotherms. Results show that sulfate adsorption capacity {{of a range of}} stagnopodzol (Histic-stagno-podzol (Leptic), WRB), brown podzolic soil (Histic-umbrisol (Leptic), WRB) and stagnohumic gley (Histic-stagno-gleysol, WRB) B-horizons was positively related to the amounts of extractable (pyrophosphate and oxalate) Fe + Al, with the stagnopodzol and brown podzolic soil <b>Bs</b> <b>horizon</b> having the largest adsorption capacity and stagnohumic gley Bg horizon the smallest adsorption capacity. Results show that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has a negative but limited effect on sulfate adsorption in these soils.

50|$|These soils have <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> {{that are}} very hard when dry, {{swelling}} to a sticky, compact mass when wet. They usually develop in saline parent materials in semiarid and subhumid regions. Properties of the <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> are associated with sodium ions that cause the clay to disperse readily and swell on wetting, thus closing the large pores and preventing water flow. Solonetzic soils cover almost 73 000 km2 (0.7%) of Canada's land area; most occur in southern Alberta, {{because of the large}} areas of saline parent material and semiarid climate.|$|R
50|$|In {{both the}} FAO and USDA soil taxonomy, a {{vertisol}} (Vertosol in the Australian Soil Classification) is a soil {{in which there}} is a high content of expansive clay known as montmorillonite that forms deep cracks in drier seasons or years. Alternate shrinking and swelling causes self-mulching, where the soil material consistently mixes itself, causing vertisols to have an extremely deep A horizon and no <b>B</b> <b>horizon.</b> (A soil with no <b>B</b> <b>horizon</b> is called an A/C soil). This heaving of the underlying material to the surface often creates a microrelief known as gilgai.|$|E

5000|$|B horizons form below an O, A, or E {{horizon and}} they have {{undergone}} sufficient changes during soil genesis, such that the properties of their original parent material are no longer discernible. The <b>B</b> <b>horizon</b> is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "subsoil". In humid regions, B horizons are the layers of maximum accumulation of materials such as silicate clays, iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) oxides, and organic material. These materials typically accumulate through a process termed illuviation, wherein the materials gradually wash in from the overlying horizons. Accordingly, this layer is also referred to as the [...] "illuviated" [...] horizon or the [...] "zone of accumulation". In addition, it is defined as having a distinctly different structure or consistency than the horizon(s) above and the horizon(s) below. The <b>B</b> <b>horizon</b> may also have stronger colors (higher chroma) than the A horizon. In arid and semiarid regions, calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate may accumulate in the <b>B</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This order {{includes}} all soils {{that have developed}} <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> but {{do not meet the}} requirements of any of the orders described previously. Many Brunisolic soils have brownish <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> without much evidence of clay accumulation, as in Luvisolic soils, or of amorphous materials, as in Podzolic soils. With time and stable environmental conditions, some Brunisolic soils will evolve to Luvisolic soils; others, to Podzolic soils. Covering almost 790 000 km2 (8.6%) of Canada's land area, Brunisolic soils occur in association with other soils in all regions south of the permafrost zone.|$|R
5000|$|Distinctive {{bioclimatic}} regimes or {{combinations of}} pedogenic processes produce distinctive soils.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of soils from widely distributed sites reveal {{the presence of}} clay minerals with 14 / ~ d spacings in the <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> of podzolized soils in Alberta. The minerals appear to be concentrated in the 2. 0 - 0. 2 micron clay fraction, the fraction less than 0. 2 micron being comprised primarily of material amorphous to X-ray. Despite the presence of montmorillonite in the eluvial horizon and soil parent material only interstratified minerals of this group appear {{in association with the}} 14 ~- mineral. Smaller amounts of quartz, kaolinite and illite are also noted in these <b>B</b> <b>horizons.</b> The data available reveal that the 14 A mineral is derived from montmorillonite and that formation occurs in situ in the <b>B</b> <b>horizons.</b> It is apparent from the investigations conducted that weathering of associated feld-spars under mildly acid conditions, releases hydrated alumina ions. These ions not only move into the interlayer regions of montmorillonite of fine clay size, where they exist in a discontinuous manner, but are also adsorbed onto the surfaces of these minerals binding adjacent particles into aggregates of coarse clay size. Adsorbed hydrated alumina hy-droxy ions in the interlayer region are responsible for the observed 14 A d spacings...|$|R
50|$|The main {{process in}} the {{formation}} of podzols is podzolisation. Podzolisation is a complex process (or number of sub-processes) in which organic material and soluble minerals (commonly iron and aluminium) are leached from the A and E horizons to the <b>B</b> <b>horizon.</b> It involves mobilization and precipitation of dissolved organic matter, together with aluminum and iron as they leach down from the A and E horizons to the <b>B</b> <b>horizon.</b> Through this process the overlying eluvial horizons are bleached. The complexes move to the brown, red or black horizon, which consist of cemented sesquioxides and/or organic compounds. Podzolisation occurs under low pH values.|$|E
50|$|Dokuchaev was {{the first}} to label soil horizons with A, B and C designations. According to Nikiforoff, Dokuchaev's A horizon was the surface humus horizon, his <b>B</b> <b>horizon</b> was the second horizon and graded to the C horizon, which was the {{relatively}} unweathered parent material.|$|E
50|$|These sub-processes include mobilisation, {{eluviation}} and illuviation. Mobilisation and eluviation both move {{organic materials}} and minerals through the A horizon into the <b>B</b> <b>horizon.</b> During this, they react {{with the water}} (illuviation) to become oxidised. This process of podzolisation results in the characteristic soil profile of spodosols, in which the E horizon is usually an ashen grey or white colour without structure {{and there is a}} distinctive hardpan oxide layer in the <b>B</b> <b>horizon</b> (which is always darker than the E horizon). The E horizon can be dark grey in profiles which are high in organic matter, but in such cases the underlying B is very dark. Spodosols over mafic rock may have a medium brown E horizon underlain by a darker B.|$|E

40|$|The {{release of}} {{dissolved}} silicon (DSi) from A and <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> was investigated with leaching tests on unsaturated columns. As forest A horizons have larger biogenic Si (BSi) pools than arable lands, {{we compared the}} Si release from a forest and a cropland from the same geographical region developed on a Luvisol in Belgium and a Cambisol in Sweden. The A horizons released a quickly dissolving Si fraction {{in contrast to the}} <b>B</b> <b>horizons,</b> which did contain no or only little amounts of BSi and released lower Si concentrations. Our experiments show that Si export from forest soils is high {{because of the presence of}} a large reservoir of soluble BSi as well as due to the acidity of the soil (pH< 4). Leaching at two different water fluxes revealed that export in forest soils was transport controlled while cropland soils were in equilibrium. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of bacteria in soil is enormous, and soil bacterial communities can vary greatly in structure. Here, we employed a pyrosequencing-based {{analysis of the}} V 2 -V 3 16 S rRNA gene region to characterize the overall and horizon-specific (A and <b>B</b> <b>horizons)</b> bacterial community compositions in nine grassland soils, which covered three different land use types. The entire data set comprised 752, 838 sequences, 600, 544 {{of which could be}} classified below the domain level. The average number of sequences per horizon was 41, 824. The dominant taxonomic groups present in all samples and horizons were the Acidobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. Despite these overarching dominant taxa, the abundance, diversity, and composition of bacterial communities were horizon specific. In almost all cases, the estimated bacterial diversity (H') was higher in the A horizons than in the corresponding <b>B</b> <b>horizons.</b> In addition, the H' was positively correlated with the organic carbon content, the total nitrogen content, and the C-to-N ratio, which decreased with soil depth. It appeared that lower land use intensity results in higher bacterial diversity. The majority of sequences affiliated with the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Fibrobacteres, Firmicutes, Spirochaetes, Verrucomicrobia, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria were derived from A horizons, whereas the majority of the sequences related to Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospira, TM 7, and WS 3 originated from <b>B</b> <b>horizons.</b> The distribution of some bacterial phylogenetic groups and subgroups in the different horizons correlated with soil properties such as organic carbon content, total nitrogen content, or microbial biomass...|$|R

5000|$|Brown earths have a {{long history}} of being a major {{grouping}} in most soil classifications. In France they have been included with [...] "sol brun acide", although these soils may tend to have more iron and aluminium in the <b>B</b> <b>horizon,</b> and tend to what, in the British classification, is called a brown podzolic soil. Brown earths are also classified in the German and Austrian soil taxonomy as [...] "Braunerde." [...] Braunerden are widespread and frequently occur on unconsolidated parent sand or loess parent materials. [...] "Parabraunerde" [...] is the classification for a brown earth with an elluvial horison above a slightly argillic, clayey illuvial horizon. This gives rise to a universal division of these, generally brown and well drained soils into the weakly leached brown earths - called cambisols in the international World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB); and more leached brown podzolic soils in which there is an orange-brown <b>B</b> <b>horizon,</b> but no pale leached horizon between the A and the B horizons.

After 2. 5 years and 3 winter crops, gypsum, {{and to a lesser extent}} the stubble treatments, resulted in significant changes to the composition of the exchangeable and soluble cations, and to soil physical properties. When gypsum was combined with SR, the beneficial effects of this ameliorant on soil properties were present in both the A and <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> of the soil. When combined with SB, the gypsum treatments were only effective in the A horizon. Organic carbon levels in the A and <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> were not significantly affected by the gypsum or stubble treatments. However, micromorphological evidence indicated that in the A horizon, biological activity was greater in SR plots than SB plots. Soil dispersion, penetrometer resistance, and bulk density were reduced in plots treated with gypsum compared with plots without gypsum. A stubble management effect was also present, showing lower dispersion scores, penetrometer resistance values, and bulk densities in SR plots than SB plots. The available water holding capacity of the soil from Natimuk was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in the gypsum-treated plots than in plots without gypsum. This effect was limited to the A horizon of the SB plots, but was apparent for the A and <b>B</b> <b>horizons</b> of the plots treated with SR. The use of gypsum in combination with SR (and break crops) may improve soil physical and chemical properties at a greater depth than the use of gypsum with SB alone. F. P. Valzano, R. S. B.
