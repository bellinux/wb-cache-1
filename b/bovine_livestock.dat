Veterinary Microbiology, 160 (3 - 4), 369 - 377. Cattle represent {{a major source}} of fecal contamination worldwide. Understanding the natural variation of the <b>bovine</b> <b>livestock</b> fecal microbiota is therefore important. For this reason we addressed the yearly differences of the fecal microbiota for <b>bovine</b> <b>livestock</b> reared in the same geographical region from 1999 to 2007 ?analyzing a total of 300 samples representing a range of experimental regimes. The aim of our work was to determine the effect of year visa experimental regime of the <b>bovine</b> <b>livestock</b> fecal microbiota. We used a newly developed high-throughput 16 S rRNA sequencing approach (a single mixed Sanger sequence was generated per sample) in combination with deep pyrosequencing. We found that similar feeding and treatment regimes for different years showed major differences in the fecal microbiota, suggesting other factors important for shaping the fecal microbiota than those experimentally controlled. Ruminococcaeae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Acinetobacter, Escherichia/Shigella, Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillales were the main taxa associated with the yearly fluctuations. Furthermore, we found that fecal samples with high levels of Lactobacillales, Ruminococcaea and Lachnospiraceae had the most even species distributions. The Peptostreptococcaceae and Acinetobacter dominated samples, on the other hand, showed a few highly dominant taxa. Testing of neutrality showed that the evenly distributed samples were explained by a neutral mode (that the assembly of the microbiota was random), while for the other samples there were overrepresentation of the dominant species (indicating bacterial-bacterial nice competition). We therefore propose that there are natural yearly fluctuations of the <b>bovine</b> <b>livestock</b> microbiota?both with respect to ecology and composition. This knowledge will have impact on our management of fecal bacteria in the environment, since {{it is very difficult to}} predict risk based on historical data. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Infections from Cryptosporidium parvum are of {{interest}} not only to public health, but also to wildlife conservation, particularly when humans and livestock encroach on nature and thereby {{increase the risk of}} cross-species transmissions. To clarify this risk, we used polymerase chain reaction to examine the hypervariable region of the C. parvum 18 S rRNA gene in feces from three monkey species. Samples were isolated from regions where disease transmission between monkeys, livestock, and humans was likely (soiled habitat) or unlikely (clean habitat). Monkey individuals, their social groups, and different species shared multiple genotypes/isolates of C. parvum. Ecological and molecular analyses suggested that Cryptosporidium infection among Toque macaques in soiled habitats was mainly the bovine genotype C. parvum.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{analysis}} is to evaluate how generic properties of networks of livestock farms connected by movements of cattle impact on the potential for spread of infectious diseases. We focus on endemic diseases with long infectious periods in affected cattle, such as <b>bovine</b> tuberculosis. <b>Livestock</b> farm networks provide a rare example of large but fully specified directed contact networks, allowing investigations into how properties of such networks impact the potential for spread of infections within them. Here we quantify the latter {{in terms of the}} basic reproduction number, R 0, and partition the contributions to R 0 from first order moments (mean contact rates) and second order moments (variances and covariances of contact rates) of the farm contact matrices. We find that the second order properties make a substantial contribution to the magnitude of R 0, similarly to that reported for other populations. Importantly, however, we find that the magnitude of these effects depends on exactly how the contacts between farms are defined or weighted. We note that the second order properties of a directed contact network may vary through time even with little change in the mean contact rates or in overall connectedness of the network.

The study involved testing some 400 cattle, 200 sheep and 170 goats for tuberculosis and brucellosis and interviewing 98 livestock keepers. Single comparative intradermal tuberculin test and Rose Bengal plate test were used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and brucellosis, respectively. Tuberculosis was recorded in 27 cattle, 1 goat and 1 sheep. In cattle, the estimated individuallevel and herd-level tuberculosis prevalence was 5. 9 % and 35 %, respectively. The individual-level and herdlevel brucellosis prevalence in cattle was 2. 6 % and 12 %, respectively. The questionnaire survey showed that most respondents had no accurate knowledge about the transmission of zoonoses. It was also found that some of their behaviours would potentially facilitate the transmission of zoonotic pathogens to human, such as raw animal product consumption and backyard slaughtering. Even though the prevalence of the two diseases was relatively low, surveillance and prevention may be warranted taking into account possible animal genetic improvement programs, unrestricted animal movement in the area and low awareness of the community about zoonoses, which might result in an increased transmission to humans...|$|R

40|$|Brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) {{were first}} {{introduced}} from Australia to New Zealand in 1858 {{to establish a}} fur industry. Currently numbering more than 65 million, they are recognised {{as the most important}} mammalian pest in New Zealand, because of the environmental and agricultural damage they cause. Possums act as a wildlife reservoir of bovine tuberculosis (Tb) and, as such, threaten New Zealand's multi-million dollar beef and dairy industry. Eliminating <b>bovine</b> Tb in <b>livestock</b> requires removal of contact with infected possums. This is mainly achieved through the intensive poisoning of areas of known wildlife Tb infection and the establishment around them of zones of low possum density (known as buffer zones) adjacent to at-risk farmland. Not only does this result in lower possum density, and thus fewer dispersing possums, but may also affect the movement patterns of possums. Measurement of gene frequency differences between populations associated with a buffer zone would allow a qualitative estimate of the effect of buffer zones on limiting possum movement. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region is an effective marker for detecting intraspccific genetic structure because it has a high mutation rate, lack of recombination and uniparental mode of inheritance. An extensive survey of brushtail possum mtDNA control region variation in New Zealand was conducted to quantify levels of variation and thus assess the utility of the mtDNA control region as a marker for detecting genetic differentiation between possum populations. Nine haplotypes were found among 70 possums from throughout New Zealand. Most of the variation (six haplotypes) was concentrated in the North Island, and the most widespread haplotype (occurring in all four islands surveyed) was also the most common - found in 67 % of possums surveyed. The technique of single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) was developed for the brushtail possum so that a quick, cost-effective and sensitive method for surveying mtDNA control region variation in large numbers of individuals was available. This assay was applied to screen the variation in possums separated by small spatial scales associated with two buffer zones in the South Island. A total of 234 possums were screened, with 98. 7 % found to possess the same haplotype. The other 1. 3 %, all from one location, possessed a second haplotype. The extremely low levels of variation makes it highly unlikely that surveys of variation in mtDNA will be able to detect an effect of buffer zones on possum movement, at least in the South Island. Areas of higher variation, such as certain parts on the North Island, would be better candidates for testing the effect of barriers such as buffer zones on genetic differentiation between possum populations...|$|R

Eleven classes were selected considering the main land cover types in the region. The classification results showed high overall accuracy (above 92. 5 %) and kappa coefficient (above 0. 91). Broadly, the range of dates of the Landsat images used allowed for the differentiation between classes.

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} is an {{endemic disease}} {{with a low}} prevalence in South African cattle. This is mostly {{the result of a}} national bovine tuberculosis control scheme which has been in place for nearly 40 years and has prevented outbreaks from spreading and causing large-scale losses, thereby also minimising the risk in view of human health. However, with the establishment of African buffalo as a successful wildlife maintenance host a new, yet undetermined risk factor has been introduced. It poses an entirely new challenge on national and provincial authorities to meet the 'fit for purpose' principle in terms of reducing economic losses but also the potentially negative impact on conservation efforts and, most of all, to protect human health and livelihoods. There is a need to shift the focus of bovine tuberculosis control from an exclusively cattle based to an integrated strategy, which takes into consideration the wildlife reservoir and the added risk of Mycobacterium bovis transmission between cattle and buffalo populations. In order to justify such a change in strategy, data regarding the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis in wildlife reservoirs need to be available to underpin the interdependence of <b>bovine</b> tuberculosis in <b>livestock</b> and wildlife. This thesis describes the establishment of a set of molecular tools for researching the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis in both livestock and wildlife and their crucial contribution to insight in the genetic diversity of M. bovis in South Africa. Furthermore it was demonstrated beyond doubt that spillover of M. bovis from cattle to wildlife has occurred and revealed important clues on the course of the epidemic within the Kruger National Park by intra- and interspecies spread of one dominant M. bovis strain. Evaluation of new and improved diagnostic methods based on both the cellular immunity and humoral immune response were undertaken and showed that especially the gamma interferon assay holds a high potential for more practical and reliable testing of buffalo and cattle for bovine tuberculosis than conventional approaches. In the long-term, all diagnostic assays applied and evaluated will {{play a crucial role in}} the implementation and monitoring of a suitable control strategy in wildlife as well as cattle. The principal aim for controlling bovine tuberculosis is to eliminate the risk of infecting humans, but also to protect biodiversity in indigenous wildlife. Ultimately vaccination will be the most feasible, economical and ethically acceptable control option in South Africa and work presented in this thesis has resulted in both an experimental intratonsilar infection model in buffalo and provided the first insight into the immune responsiveness of buffalo to vaccination with BCG Pasteur vaccine.

Decreased expression of ß 1 -integrin and focal adhesion kinase in epithelial cells may initiate involution of mammary glands. Journal of Cellular Physiology 200, 318 - 325 Extended periods of milk accumulation result in loss of secretory activity, increased apoptosis and eventually, involution of mammary glands. This process is associated with increased permeability of the tight junction (TJ) complexes between adjacent mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The change in cell shape during mammary engorgement from a cuboidal to a flattened morphology may initiate changes in protein and gene expression (mechanotransduction) that trigger these processes. Therefore, {{this study examined the}} regulation of the major TJ protein components during mammary engorgement, and in particular the role of physical distension of the mammary epithelium in the regulatory process. Expression of the integral transmembrane TJ proteins, occludin and claudin- 1, and the cytoplasmic TJ protein, ZO- 1, were down-regulated in both bovine and rat mammary glands during the early stages of mammary apoptosis and involution following the abrupt cessation of milk removal. In the rat, these responses were locally regulated as they occurred only in teat-sealed glands in a hemi-suckled model. Furthermore, the down-regulation of TJ proteins is consistent with a loss of TJ integrity during mammary engorgement. Induced physical distension of rat mammary glands in vivo transiently up-regulated the expression levels of occludin protein and mRNA, and ZO- 1 mRNA, followed by an accelerated decrease in expression compared with the effects of milk accumulation alone. This was associated with the initiation of apoptosis, the up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic factor pSTAT 3, and the down-regulation of the cell-ECM survival factor βl-integrin. An in vitro model was also developed to stretch MECs, mimicking the flattening in cell shape during mammary engorgement in vivo. While stretching MECs in vitro did not conclusively alter TJ protein expression, the overall results of this project support further investigation into the role of the TJ complex in mechanotransduction pathways. In addition, the results point to crosstalk between cell-ECM survival signalling and STAT 3 death signalling as a candidate for regulation by physical distension of the mammary epithelium. In conclusion, this study supports the hypothesis that physical distension during engorgement of the mammary glands with milk is a primary trigger initiating apoptosis of MECs through changes in the regulation of gene pathways controlling cell survival and death, and the disruption of TJ function...|$|R

The aims of {{this study}} were to estimate the seroprevalence of bovine brucellosis and risk factors associated with the seropositivity in rural and peri-urban buffaloes and cattle populations of Sindh. Firstly, a cross sectional study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of bovine brucellosis in cattle and buffaloes of Sindh province, Pakistan. Serum samples (2600) were tested using Rose Bengal Plate Test. The overall seroprevalence of brucellosis in Sindh province was 13. 96 % (95 % C. I.; 11. 55 - 16. 37). Of the 917 herds tested, 232 or 25. 30 % herds (95 %C. I.; 22. 51 - 28. 24) were positive for brucellosis. The adult animals were 2. 05 (95 % C. I.; 1. 14 - 3. 68, P= 0. 02) times more likely to test positive for brucellosis. The animals in a peri-urban dairy production system were 2. 07 times (95 %C. I.; 1. 09 - 3. 90, P = 0. 03) times more likely have brucellosis. The species or sex of animal did not appear to affect the risk of seropositivity in cattle or buffalo in this population. Secondly, a cross sectional survey was conducted to understand the structure and composition of farms, animal husbandry and management practices in peri-urban dairy colonies in Karachi and farmers’ awareness of zoonoses. The mean herd size was 93. 58 animals and 88. 01 % of these animals were female buffaloes. Of 326 farms surveyed, only 37. 42 % were able to associate animals with transmission of diseases in human. The characteristics of peri-urban dairy farms in Karachi are discussed. Thirdly, the value of FTA® cards in detecting the Brucella DNA in milk samples was estimated by determining the detection limits of genus specific ERI PCR assay for FTA® cards and comparing the PCR results from whole sediments taken from culturing pooled milk samples with taking sediment on FTA® cards. The detection limits of this method ranged from 6. 6 x 103 cfu/ml for B. abortus to 7. 17 x 106 cfu/ml for B. suis. Assuming the results of ERI PCR for the whole sediment as gold standard (method 1), the method using sediment on FTA® cards as test samples (method 2) showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 81. 44 % (95 % C. I.; 75. 54 - 87. 33) but a poor diagnostic specificity of 42. 86 % (95 %C. I.; 16. 95 - 68. 78). The kappa value, κ, was 0. 14 (p = 0. 02) demonstrating a poor agreement between the two methods. Lastly, 181 bulk milk samples were used to estimate the herd level prevalence of bovine brucellosis in Landhi dairy colony, Karachi. The ERI PCR was used to test these samples. The herd prevalence was estimated as 92. 26 % (95 % C. I.; 88. 34 - 96. 19). For each level (50 animals) increase in herd size, the risk of herd being brucellosis positive increases by 2. 38 times. The herds that have a male animal for breeding are 0. 09 times less likely to have brucellosis. The history of abortion, presence of small ruminants or the regions of animal purchase don’t appear to have any association with the risk of brucellosis at a herd level in this population at LDC, Karachi.

Previous studies showed that buparvaquone, similarly to others hydroxynaphtoquinone, probably acts by binding to cytochrome b (cyt b) inhibiting the electron transport chain in the parasite. Several observations suggested that T. annulata is becoming resistant to buparvaquone in many endemic regions (Tunisia, Turkey and Iran), which may hinder the development of <b>bovine</b> <b>livestock</b> in these areas. In the present study we sought to determine whether point mutations in T. annulata cytochrome b gene could be associated to buparvaquone resistance. A total of 28 clones were studied in this work, 19 of which were obtained from 3 resistant isolates (ST 2 / 12, ST 2 / 13 and ST 2 / 19) collected at different time after treatment, from a field treatment failure and nine clones isolated from 4 sensitive stocks of T. annulata (Beja, Battan, Jed 4 and Sousse). The cytochrome b gene was amplified and sequenced. We identified five point mutations at the protein sequences (114, 129, 253, 262 and 347) specific for the clones isolated from resistant stocks. Two of them affecting 68 % (13 / 19) of resistant clones, {{are present in the}} drug-binding site Q 02 region at the position 253 in three resistant clones and at the position 262 in 11 out of 19 resistant clones. These two mutations substitute a neutral and hydrophobic amino acids by polar and hydrophilic ones which could interfere with the drug binding capabilities. When we compared our sequences to the Iranian ones, the phylogenetic tree analyses show the presence of a geographical sub-structuring in the population of T. annulata. Taken together, our results suggest that the cytochrome b gene may be used as a tool to discriminate between different T. annulata genotypes and also as a genetic marker to characterize resistant isolates of T. annulata...|$|E

A Dissertation {{presented}} to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. Dissertation supervisors: Dr. Richard Houseman and Dr. Jennifer Benne. Vita. Mosquito presence and fitness play key roles in the spread of zoonotic pathogens affecting human as well as livestock and wild populations of vertebrates. This study examined the (1) differences between mosquito communities collected from mid-Missouri agricultural locations having differing primary livestock hosts and (2) genetic differences between populations of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) collected from four differing latitudes. Adult mosquito collections from 15 trapping locations that maintained 5 different primary livestock groups were made during 2009 and 2010. MRPP analysis indicated {{a difference between the}} mosquito community collected from the bovine trap sites and the community collected from the capine trap sites. An indicator species analysis found three particular mosquito species that may indicate the presence of <b>bovine</b> <b>livestock</b> in the environment. The ability of female mosquitoes to transmit pathogens among vertebrate populations has a direct relationship with her fitness as an adult. During the summer of 2010 four populations of Ae. albopictus were collected and used for comparisons of phenotypic traits expressed under the same environmental conditions. Florida larvae developed faster than Ohio and Georgia larvae in the same environment. During interspecific competition, Georgia larvae developed slower than Tennessee and Ohio larvae. Microsatellite analysis found genetic differences between the Ohio and Florida populations, but none due to geographic separation. These latitudinally separated populations of the invasive Ae. albopictus have exhibited genetic differences in body size that may significantly influence their success in disease transmission. This study adds more information concerning the presence of genetic differences of populations from differing climates that influence body size and female mosquito fitness.

40|$|In England, {{over the}} last decade the rising {{incidence}} of bovine TB has resulted in recognised economic impacts on the agricultural and ancillary industries. Nowhere has the dramatic increase in bovine TB been more evident than in Southwest England, a region which is characterised by smaller, family-run farms often specialising in relatively extensive <b>bovine</b> <b>livestock</b> systems, whether dairying or beef production. The economic impacts result from the nature of the disease, the government's control measures (restrictions on movement of cattle on and off the farm, repeat testing and compulsory cleaning) and the impact of test 'failures' on the normal marketing of livestock and product. Moreover, this worsening of the disease situation - and hence increasing economic impact - of bovine TB coincides with a period of considerable economic pressures for the agricultural industry. Principal among these are (a) the recent major changes in the CAP, (b) established long-term changes in the food chain (many of which are detrimental to primary producers), (c) new requirements for an increasingly environmentally-friendly farming systems and (d) increased competitive pressures from the enlargement of the EU and greater exposure to global markets. In conjunction with the farming industry, the veterinary profession and other stakeholders, the government is currently developing a new strategy for tackling bovine TB. Bovine TB is acknowledged {{as one of the most}} difficult animal health problems facing UK farmers with the incidence now rising at 18 per cent each year. A further factor of particular relevance is the government's recent Animal Health and Welfare Strategy and its implications for affected herds. There is no scientific consensus about why the incidence of bovine TB is rising again (having apparently been brought under reasonable control by the 1970 s), although there is increasing scientific evidence of a reservoir of infection in wildlife, particularly in badgers.

40|$|A pecuária bovina é um dos mais importantes setores do agronegócio brasileiro. Entretanto, a sanidade dos rebanhos brasileiros - peça {{fundamental}} para a atividade - ainda é uma questão pouco estudada em termos econômicos. Assim, este trabalho buscou identificar os principais determinantes do uso das medidas preventivas estabelecidas pelo Programa Nacional de Controle e Erradicação da Brucelose e Tuberculose Animal (PNCEBT). Para isso, utilizou-se um modelo Tobit em painel. Os principais resultados indicam que o início efetivo do programa, em 2004, estimulou significativamente o aumento das medidas. Também observou-se que a vacinação não é influenciada pelos preços pagos tanto para carne quanto para leite, mas que esses afetavam positivamente o número de exames de tuberculose. Variáveis relativas às transferências do governo federal por convênio aos estados e às exportações de carne ou leite não foram significativas. Concluiu-se que o PNCEBT vem apresentando bons resultados. Além disso, podem ser planejados incentivos econômicos aos produtores, de modo a estimular o aumento das práticas preventivas estudadas. The <b>bovine</b> <b>livestock</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} important sectors in the Brazilian agribusiness. However, Brazilian herds' health - very important for the activity - is still an issue rarely studied in economic terms. Therefore, the present study tried to identify the major determinants of the use of preventive measures established in the National Program for Control and Eradication of Animal Brucellosis and Tuberculosis (PNCEBT). For this, a Panel Tobit model was used. Results show that the effective beginning of PNCEBT in 2004, has significantly stimulated the increase of measures' use. It was also observed that vaccination is not influenced by the prices paid both for meat and milk, but those affected positively the number of tuberculosis tests. Variables related to federal government transfer, by agreement, to states and meat or milk exports were not significant. It was concluded that the PNCEBT has been showing good results. Moreover, economic incentives can be planned for producers, aiming to stimulate the increase in preventive practices...|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, {{changes in}} climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents. Mediterranean {{countries}} will be particularly affected by this phenomenon, with growing temperatures and reduced rainfall during summer months. Understanding how species and ecosystems respond to climate change has become a crucial focus in ecology, biodiversity conservation and management. The recent availability of genome-wide SNP panels allows providing background information concerning genome structure in domestic animals, opening new perspectives to livestock genetics. Several approaches have been performed in landscape genomics to detect adaptation to different climate pressure by correlations between genomic data and climate variables. The International Project GALIMED "Genetic Adaptation of <b>Bovine</b> <b>Livestock</b> and production systems in MEDiterranean region", funded by INRA (metaprogram ACCAF), develops an integrated approach that combines the analysis of SNP markers, bioclimatic variables and farming system information to identify genotypes and breeding practices {{able to respond to}} climate change. The general aim of the research is to identify genomic regions related to adaptation to climate change in these local cattle. In this work in particular, the genetic variability within breed and the genetic relationships between Italian and Corse local cattle breeds, that are part of this project, will be presented. Individuals of Cinisara (71), Modicana (72), Maremmana (25), Piemontese (21), Romagnola (21), Sarda (30), Sardo-Modicana (28) and Corse (31) cattle breeds, were genotyped using Illumina Bovine SNP 50 k BeadChip. Piemontese e Romagnola genotyping data were public available, whereas the other breeds are part of the GALIMED project. Farming systems data were collected by interviewing breeders. Geographic coordinates and 19 bioclimatic variables were also available. A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed either on SNPs data and climatic variables. Afterwards a Co-inertia (CIA) analysis was realized to detect a possible common structure between such different information. We present here first results of genetic variability and climatic data. After edits, 43, 625 SNPs were retained for the analysis. Breeds are clearly differentiated according to geography and climate. The first axis of PCA on individual genotypes differentiates Modicana from other breeds, and shows that Sardo-Modicana is close to Modicana, but is clearly admixed to another breed. The second axis differentiates Cinisara from a cluster "Romagnola/Maremmana" and shows a large variability of the Modicana breed. The CIA coefficient between molecular data and both geographic and climatic information is equal to 0. 38, significantly greater than 0 (p-value= 0. 001), suggesting evidence of genetic adaptation to different climatic pressures of the studied breeds. Further analyses are on going to identify the genetic regions with a potential adaptive role. The results will provide to farmers, technicians and industrial partners, a solid scientific foundation to reconsider their objectives and selection criteria and to improve their farming practices to prepare their livestock to the new environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Resumo:O objetivo central desta tese é analisar as relações de arrendamento e parceria no meio rural brasileiro nas últimas duas décadas. Observou-se a presença do arrendamento e da parceria em todo país, com grande heterogeneidade em formato, resultados da produção e provavelmente em ganhos de eficiência. A hipótese que orientou a pesquisa é que tal heterogeneidade não se explica apenas a partir das conhecidas diferenças regionais, e que por isto é necessário conhecer - como se tentou fazer neste trabalho - os principais condicionantes que regem as relações contratuais entre arrendatários, parceiros e proprietários. Sustenta-se que o arrendamento e a parceria, que no passado tiveram presença marcante no sistema agrário brasileiro, perdem expressão como mecanismos de acesso de pequenos produtores à terra de médios e grandes proprietários. Segundo a hipótese discutida no trabalho, o arrendamento e parceria estariam cada vez mais restritos ao contexto institucional (sócioeconômico, político, cultural) dos produtores mais capitalizados e experientes, os quais teriam condições produtivas e financeiras de aproveitar oportunidades de negócios e para se inserir nas cadeias agroindustriais mais complexas e estruturadas (por exemplo, soja, milho, cana de açúcar e álcool, pecuária bovina, arroz irrigado) sem a necessidade de imobilizar capital na compra de terras. Para os proprietários a opção pelo arrendamento (e parceria) encontra uma variedade de motivações, desde eliminar as preocupações relacionadas à gestão da atividade produtiva, evitar os riscos inerentes à agricultura até suprir a falta de capacidade (gerencial) e condições (financeiras) para explorar diretamente um negócio que é cada vez mais complexo e exigente. Conclui-se que a utilização do arrendamento e da parceria no Brasil voltado para pequenos produtores é um fenômeno geograficamente localizado e que, em geral, os contratos envolvem produtores mais capitalizados. O pequeno produtor geralmente não consegue obter um desempenho satisfatório em decorrência da dificuldade de acesso aos mercados, do nível de riqueza, da falta de qualificação e experiência para se consolidar na atividade produtiva. Nota-se um freqüente burlamento dos contratos, embora estejam regulamentados pela legislação para atender às reivindicações dos contratantes. Os prazos são diluídos em favor de interesses pontuais dos proprietários, principalmente, a recuperação de solos degradados e ocupação de áreas passíveis de conflitos agrários. Admite-se que sem a superação da instabilidade da propriedade (i. e., melhor definição dos direitos de propriedade) e a criação de mecanismos de incentivos para os próprios beneficiários, dificilmente os contratos de arrendamento e parceria tornar-se-ão uma opção viável de acesso à terra. Pelo contrário, esses contratos limitar-se-ão a um instrumento paliativo para tratar da grave questão agrária brasileira. O corolário disso seria um aumento da ineficiência na alocação dos recursos e das desigualdades sociais no meio ruralAbstract: The central {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze leasing and sharecropping relationships in the Brazilian rural areas {{in the last two}} decades. The presence of leasing and sharecropping in every state of the country with great heterogeneity in format, production results and probably in won of efficiency was observed. The hypothesis that guided this research is that such heterogeneity is not just explained by regional differences. But this work also tried to discover the main factors that govern the contractual relationships between tenants, sharecroppers and landlords. It is considered that leasing and sharecropping practiced in the Brazilian agrarian system in the past, lost influence as an access mechanism of small producers to the lands of medium and big landlords. According to the hypothesis discussed in this work, leasing and sharecropping became more and more restricted to the institutional context (socioeconomic, political, cultural) of producers who were more capitalized and had more expertise. Only they would have productive and financial conditions for taking advantage of business opportunities and to participate in the agro-industry chains that became more complex and structured (for instance, soy, corn, cane of sugar and alcohol, <b>bovine</b> <b>livestock,</b> irrigated rice) without the need of investing capital in the purchase of lands. For the landlords, the option of leasing and sharecropping has a variety of reasons ranging from eliminating the concerns related to the administration of the productive activity, to avoiding the inherent risks to agriculture like the lack of managerial capacity and financial conditions for developing businesses that are more and more complex and demanding. The study concluded that leasing and sharecropping in Brazil for small producers is a geographically located phenomenon and usually, the contracts involve more capitalized producers. The small producer does not usually get satisfactory results due to his difficult access to markets, his level of wealth, his lack of qualification and experience to be able to consolidate productive activity. Frequent noncompliance of contracts is noticed, even though they are regulated by legislation to assist the claims of the contracting parties. The periods are altered in favor of the punctual interests of the landlords, mainly, the recovery of degraded soils and occupation of areas susceptible to agrarian conflicts. It is admitted that without the elimination of the instability of property (i. e., better definition of the property rights) and the creation of mechanisms of incentives for beneficiaries, it will be difficult for leasing agreements and partnership to become a viable option of access to land. On the contrary, these contracts will be limited to a palliative instrument for treating the serious Brazilian agrarian problem. The corollary of that would be an increase of inefficiency in the allocation of resources and the creation of more social inequalities in the rural are...|$|E
