5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E

[...] Discussing the woman who inspired Mavis's characterisation, Barlow said, [...] "She had a strong core, but didn't show it.

He {{found it difficult}} to represent three time periods, but felt that the film could appeal to everyone if he chose to [...] "keep some of it in the past and still make it youthful and modern." [...] He said, [...] "I have created humour and situations which would <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> by everyone". For instance, he chose to display a different side to the Indian independence movement of the 1910s as opposed to the [...] "unromantic and non-colourful" [...] depicton.

500|$|In Stage three (good {{intentions}} {{as determined}} by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They {{try to be a}} [...] "good boy" [...] or [...] "good girl" [...] to live up to these expectations, having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the [...] "golden rule". [...] "I want to <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me." [...] Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that [...] "they mean well".|$|E

In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want your performance to <b>be</b> <b>liked.</b> You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. Things are going to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are going to be different sides of him that you're going to get to see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E
500|$|In 1930, Grant toured {{for nine}} months in a {{production}} of the musical, The Street Singer. After the production came to end in early 1931, the Shuberts invited him to spend the summer performing on the stage at The Muny in St. Louis, Missouri; he appeared in twelve different productions, putting on 87 shows. He received praise from local newspapers for these performances, gaining {{a reputation as a}} romantic leading man. Significant influences on his acting in this period were Sir Gerald du Maurier, A. E. Matthews, Jack Buchanan and Ronald Squire. He later admitted that he was drawn to acting because of a [...] "great need to <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> and admired". Grant was eventually fired by the Shuberts {{at the end of the}} summer season when he refused to accept a pay cut because of financial difficulties caused by the Depression. His unemployment was short lived; impresario William B. Friedlander offered him the lead romantic part in his new musical, Nikki, in which Grant starred opposite Fay Wray as a soldier in post-World War I France. The production opened on September 29, 1931 in New York, but was stopped after just 39 performances due to the effects of the Depression.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 76, based on 23 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Jaime Gill of BBC Music called the album a [...] "brief, brilliant record that leaves you panting, Body Talk, Part 2 {{is the latest}} evidence that Robyn is probably the best, most versatile pop star currently at work." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine referred to the album as [...] "pretty fucking fantastic", despite stating that it was [...] "a minor letdown following the near-perfection of its predecessor". Tom Ewing of The Guardian said that [...] "the second episode [...] has a different flavour from the first." [...] Ewing named [...] "U Should Know Better" [...] the best song on the record, calling it the [...] "unlikeliest success". In contrast, he considered [...] "Criminal Intent" [...] the worst song, but said that [...] "even that has a lovely, draggy vibe." [...] Dan Martin of the NME wrote that the album [...] "doesn't quite end with a severed hand, but it does swing a little lower with an awesomeness that tries less hard to <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> straight away." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is {{assigned}} {{six hours of}} counseling with Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) after he physically reprimanded his nephew Luke (Evan Peters) in [...] "Nepotism", but Michael refuses to speak to Toby. One hour into their session, Toby tells Michael {{that he will not}} fill in the official assessment form unless Michael talks to him, so Michael begins telling ridiculous stories. Toby then tries the common counseling method of playing games with the client to get them to open up more. The method works, and Michael opens up to Toby about his personal history and relationships with people (he mentions seeing a baseball game with his stepfather where he was told that the team's manager deserved respect and how he never forgot that), and Toby makes an important discovery that Michael needs to <b>be</b> <b>liked.</b> Michael realizes what is happening, gets angry at Toby, and denigrates his counseling ability. Toby gives up and gives Michael the official form, allowing him to fill it out however he wants. In his haste, Michael accidentally checks off on the form that he is severely depressed and homicidal. Gabe contacts Toby, confused by his extreme assessment of Michael. Although Michael initially blames Toby for the mishap, he turns his ire to Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), even making Toby laugh. Michael openly offers to return to the break room with Toby and [...] "bang this out". At the end of the episode, they are both talking and drawing pictures.|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants was an {{immediate}} hit. Within its first month on air, it overtook Pokémon (1997) as the highest-rated Saturday morning children's series. By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children's series on television. Nickelodeon began adding SpongeBob SquarePants to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block. This programming change {{increased the number of}} older viewers significantly. By May 2002, the show's total viewership reached more than 61 million, 20 million of which were aged 18 to 49. Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: [...] "I never imagined that it would get to this point. When you set out to do a show about a sponge, you can't anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to make ourselves laugh, then ask if it's appropriate for children. I can tell you that we hoped it would <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> by adults. But we really thought the best we could hope for was a college audience." [...] SpongeBob SquarePants has gone on {{to become one of the}} longest-running series on Nickelodeon. [...] "Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. It never was possible to conceive that. ...I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it," [...] Hillenburg said in 2009 during the show's tenth anniversary.
