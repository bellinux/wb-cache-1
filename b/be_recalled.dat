5|$|While Delrina {{lost the}} court case, the {{publicity}} it generated was substantial, with coverage {{in over a}} thousand newspapers across North America, resulting in consumers turning out in droves to buy the offending program before it could <b>be</b> <b>recalled.</b>|$|E
5|$|This deed won him great honour and fame: Praejecta, {{the widow}} of Areobindus and niece of Justinian, whom Guntharic was {{planning}} to marry, gave him a rich reward, while the emperor confirmed him as magister militum of Africa. Despite being already married to a relative of his, Artabanes eventually became engaged with Praejecta. He sent her back to Constantinople and himself asked from Justinian to <b>be</b> <b>recalled</b> from Africa, {{so that they could}} marry.|$|E

5|$|After {{starting}} {{out in the}} Delhi junior system, Kartik moved through the age group ranks at Railways, was selected for the Indian Under-19 team. He made his first-class debut in 1996–97 {{and after a few}} productive seasons at domestic level, made his Test debut in early-2000 as Kumble's bowling partner. However, he ran into disciplinary problems and was expelled from the National Cricket Academy in the same year, while new national captain Sourav Ganguly was reluctant to entrust him with responsibility. Ganguly called for off spinner Harbhajan to <b>be</b> <b>recalled</b> in 2001, and was rewarded with a series-winning performance against Australia. This entrenched the off spinner in the team and left Kartik on the outer.|$|E
5|$|George Alric R. Dewhurst (31 October 1894 – 4 January 1954) was a Trinidadian cricketer {{who played}} for West Indies before the team {{attained}} Test match status. A highly regarded wicket-keeper, Dewhurst was an influential and popular member of the Trinidad and West Indian sides. In his later career, he improved substantially as a batsman. He toured England with the West Indies team in 1923 but missed the 1928 tour of England in controversial circumstances. Despite continued speculation that he would <b>be</b> <b>recalled,</b> he did not play representative cricket again.|$|E
5|$|On August 27, 2013, Hickenlooper {{asked the}} Colorado Supreme Court to clarify if a voter had {{to vote for}} recall in order {{to vote for a}} {{replacement}} candidate. At the same time, Libertarian Jan Brooks turned in petitions to be on the ballot against Morse while Democrat Richard Anglund announced his write-in candidacy against Giron. On August 28, the Supreme Court ruled that a voter did not have to vote to recall in order to vote for a replacement, but that the Senators could only <b>be</b> <b>recalled</b> by a majority vote. Secretary of State Gessler announced that Brooks did not have sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot, leaving only Republican opponents on the ballot.|$|E
50|$|Only two {{governors}} {{have ever}} <b>been</b> successfully <b>recalled.</b> In 1921, Governor Lynn Frazier of North Dakota, <b>was</b> <b>recalled</b> during a dispute about state-owned industries.

5|$|The DVD {{edition of}} Ed Wood {{initially}} had difficulty reaching store shelves in The United States and Canada due to unspecified legal issues. The initial release had a featurette on transvestites — not {{relating to the}} film or its actors in any way — which was removed from subsequent releases. An initial street date of August 13, 2002 was announced only to be postponed. A new date of February 3, 2003 was set, only for it to <b>be</b> <b>recalled</b> again without explanation, although some copies quickly {{found their way to}} collectors' venues such as eBay. The DVD was finally released on October 19, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{arrived at}} St Helen's Pool in April 1651 {{and set about}} taking the island of Tresco, attacking the harbour of Old Grimsby and the blockhouse. Blake {{deployed}} a force of men in small boats, but they landed on the wrong island and had to <b>be</b> <b>recalled</b> to the ships. The next day the men landed on the beaches below the blockhouse; fighting ensued and the attackers were driven back. Blake's men made another landing which also saw fierce resistance, and the guns of the blockhouse were probably turned on the landing parties. Around 15 of the assault force were killed, but the guns of Blake's ships guns had a longer range {{than those of the}} blockhouse and Old Grimsby fell. Blake went on to use Tresco as a basis for taking St Mary's.|$|E
5|$|By 21 July 1914, the British had {{postponed}} {{delivery of}} Reşadiye and Sultan Osman-ı Evvel as tensions flared in Europe following {{the assassination of}} Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June. This action prompted a protest by Djemal Pasha, the Ottoman naval minister, via France, {{in the hopes of}} securing the ships' delivery. A transport ship carrying crews for the two battleships departed Constantinople on 4 August, only to <b>be</b> <b>recalled</b> on 7 August after the Ottoman government was informed that the dreadnoughts would not be delivered. First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill ordered the Royal Navy to detain the two ships on 29 July and prevent Ottoman naval personnel from boarding them; two days later, British sailors boarded the ships and formally seized them. Since Britain was not yet at war, these actions were illegal; the British government nevertheless determined to present the Ottomans with a fait accompli. On 3 August, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire informed the government that Britain had seized the ships.|$|E
50|$|On December 3, 2013, Teague was {{assigned}} to the Iowa Energy; he <b>was</b> <b>recalled</b> the next day. On December 26, 2013, he was reassigned to the Energy. On January 15, 2014, he <b>was</b> <b>recalled.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular and reserve armies, all former Regular Army personnel (known as the Regular Reserve) may <b>be</b> <b>recalled</b> for duty as needed. The Regular Reserve has two categories: A and D. Category A is mandatory, with {{the length of time}} in the category dependent on time spent in Regular Army service. Category D is voluntary, and consists of personnel who are no longer required to serve in category A. Regular Reserves in both categories serve under a fixed-term reserve contract and may report for training or service overseas and at home, similar to the Army Reserve. In 2007, there were 121,800 Regular Reserves, of which 33,760 served in categories A and D. Beginning in April 2013, the full Regular Reserve strength was no longer reported—only those serving in categories A and D (30,000 in 2015).|$|E
5|$|Keli was {{the second}} of three {{tropical}} cyclones to affect Tonga during a ten-month period, with Cyclones Hina and Ron affecting the island nation during March 1997 and January 1998. Ahead of the system impacting Tonga, the FMS issued cyclone warnings for the Niuas and strong wind warnings {{for the rest of}} Tonga. As a result of the warnings a vessel that was heading to the island group had to <b>be</b> <b>recalled,</b> which was predicted to affect supplies on the islands when it was likely to be most needed. During June 13, Keli caused some damage to the islands with plantations, breadfruit trees and other large trees devastated. The strong winds also destroyed several residences while causing damage to public buildings.|$|E
5|$|Leyland {{missed a}} {{substantial}} amount of cricket in 1937 with a broken finger, barely playing in July, and missing the Test series against New Zealand. He scored 1,306 runs at 36.27 and took 19 wickets. Injuries continued to trouble him in 1938. He scored 1,884 first class runs at 43.81, but a shoulder strain early in the season adversely affected his form. He was not selected for the first three Tests against Australia, not least as the England side contained several promising batsmen. However, he had his best season with the ball. A succession of hard, dry wickets gave fewer opportunities to orthodox spinners and Leyland took 63 wickets at 19.32. Early in the season, he took eight for 63 against Hampshire, the best figures of his career. Just as his batting form returned, and when he was likely to <b>be</b> <b>recalled</b> to the England side, Leyland broke his thumb in a match against Middlesex. However, he recovered in time to play in the final Test of the series. Australia's victory in the fourth Test had given the team a 1–0 lead.|$|E
50|$|Russ Ortiz {{was once}} again placed on the 15-day {{disabled}} list on June 7 because of a strained right forearm. Jonathan Sánchez <b>was</b> <b>recalled,</b> once again. On June 9, catcher Eliézer Alfonzo {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list and Guillermo Rodríguez <b>was</b> <b>recalled</b> from Fresno. Later that same day, outfielder Fred Lewis was placed on the 15-day disabled list because of a right oblique strain. Outfielder Dave Roberts <b>was</b> <b>recalled</b> in his place.|$|R
50|$|Brookes <b>was</b> <b>recalled</b> for {{the third}} match of the 1913-14 season, but after six matches Lee {{returned}} briefly before Fred Smith took over at right-back. Brookes <b>was</b> <b>recalled</b> in January for a further seven matches before Smith returned.|$|R
25|$|Since the City of Wildwood {{has been}} {{incorporated}} on January 1, 1912, there have <b>been</b> three <b>recall</b> elections {{all of which}} were successful. The first was in 1938 when the State's first female Mayor Doris W. Bradway and Commissioner Frederick W. Murray were voted out of office. The second successful <b>recall</b> <b>was</b> in December 1984 when Mayor Earl B. Ostrander <b>was</b> <b>recalled.</b> The third successful <b>recall</b> <b>was</b> in December 2009 when Mayor Ernest Troiano Jr. and Commissioner William N. Davenport <b>were</b> <b>recalled.</b>|$|R
5|$|President Andrew Johnson {{appointed}} Ewing as U.S. Minister to Holland, {{where he}} served from 1866 to 1870. This appointment may have drawn the ire of the Radical Republicans, for Speaker of the House James G. Blaine urged President Ulysses S. Grant that Ewing <b>be</b> <b>recalled</b> and replaced with his brother, Charles Ewing. Blaine told the President that Hugh was 'acting badly'. Blaine himself was disingenuous, having represented to prominent politicians in Ohio including Senator John Sherman {{that he was doing}} everything possible to nominate his close personal friend, former Ohio General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, for the post. Nonetheless, Blaine's request to recall General Ewing was never acted upon, possibly due to the influence of his sister, whose husband General Sherman was a very close friend to President Grant.|$|E
5|$|Taking an {{advantage}} of Mathabar's absence in Kathmandu, the military battalions {{under his command}} were distributed to other courtiers during the annual muster {{at the beginning of}} 1837. Nevertheless, Bhimsen managed to secure his and his family members' positions in the civil and military offices. An investigation was also started to check Bhimsen's expenditures in establishing various battalions. Such events led the courtiers to feel that Bhimsen's mukhtiyari would not last very long; thus Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the hopes of becoming the next mukhtiyar, {{wrote a letter to the}} King asking him to <b>be</b> <b>recalled</b> to Kathmandu from Palpa. His wish was granted; and Bhimsen, pleased to see his brother after many years, made Ranbir Singh the acting Mukhtiyar and decided to go to his ancestral home in Borlang Gorkha for the sake of pilgrimage. But in truth, Bhimsen had gone to Gorkha to placate his nephew and bring him back to Kathmandu.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} off-season, Edler {{was signed}} to an entry-level contract by the Canucks on 24 July 2006. Reporting to the Canucks' {{training camp in}} September 2006, his play had the Canucks slotting him in as the team's seventh defenseman. However, a hip injury saw him assigned to the Manitoba Moose. Following an injury to Canucks defenseman Sami Salo, he was called up to the NHL on 3 November 2006, two games into his AHL season. He made his NHL debut the following day against the Colorado Avalanche. Eleven days later, however, he was reassigned to the Moose, only to <b>be</b> <b>recalled</b> on 24 November. He scored his first NHL goal on 30 November, a slap shot that beat Anaheim Ducks goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère in a 2–1 loss. Edler was reassigned between Manitoba and Vancouver on several more occasions {{over the course of}} the 2006–07 season. He appeared in 22 games total for the Canucks, recording a goal and two assists. With the Moose, he scored five goals and 26 points over 49 games and was named Manitoba's Rookie of the Year.|$|E
25|$|After {{five years}} Onyango <b>was</b> <b>recalled</b> in a {{surprising}} fashion - {{as a number}} 11 against Australia in 2002, but didn't bowl throughout. Though missing Kenya's World Cup campaign of 2003, he <b>was</b> <b>recalled</b> for 2004 ICC Champions Trophy.|$|R
50|$|Bendysh <b>was</b> <b>recalled</b> {{from his}} post some time before 1655. He <b>was</b> <b>recalled</b> by Cromwell's Protectorate at the Restoration on 25 June 1660. However, {{in light of the}} {{changing}} political situation, he delayed his departure until 11 March 1661.|$|R
50|$|On March 4, 2014, Mekel was {{assigned}} to the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League. On March 9, he <b>was</b> <b>recalled</b> by the Mavericks. On March 15, he was reassigned to the Legends. He <b>was</b> <b>recalled</b> three days later.|$|R
5|$|Holmes {{played as}} an amateur for three season with the Parkdale Canoe Club of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) from 1908 to 1911, before joining the {{professional}} Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association (NHA) in 1912–13. Holmes won {{the first of his}} four Stanley Cups in 1914. Although being under contract to the Blueshirts, Holmes joined the Seattle Metropolitans of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) for the 1915–16 season, winning his second Stanley Cup (1917) in his second season with the Metropolitans. For the 1917–18 season, Holmes ended up playing for the Torontos (the following year renamed as the Toronto Arenas) of the National Hockey League (NHL) through a series of loans by other teams. Holmes won his third Stanley Cup in his only full season with the Torontos. After playing two games in the 1918-19 season for the Toronto Arenas, Holmes would <b>be</b> <b>recalled</b> by the Metropolitans. Holmes played for the Metropolitans for the next six seasons, until the team folded. In the 1924–25 season, Holmes joined the Victoria Cougars of the West Coast Hockey League (WCHL/WHL). Holmes played for the Cougars for two seasons, winning the Stanley Cup for his fourth and last time. After the WCHL/WHL league folded, Holmes joined the Detroit Cougars of the NHL, playing with the Cougars for two seasons before retiring.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} seventeenth century {{relatively}} {{large numbers of}} Scots took service in foreign armies involved in the Thirty Years' War, with 20–30,000 in Swedish service, a Scots brigade in the Netherlands, and 5–6,000 raised for Danish service in the period 1626–27, 11,000 for France and large numbers in the armies of eastern Europe, including German states, Poland and Russia. As armed confrontation between Scotland and the Charles I looked increasingly likely from 1637, the Standing Committee of the Tables began {{to function as a}} war council. It appointed two lairds in every parish to draw up lists of men suitable for military service, arms and the names of Scots serving abroad so that they could <b>be</b> <b>recalled.</b> Three commissioners were appointed in each shire, two residing in Edinburgh and another remaining in the locality, where presbyteries appointed commissioners to communicate instructions to the parishes. Hundreds of Scots mercenaries returned home from foreign service, including experienced leaders like Alexander and David Leslie. These veterans {{played an important role in}} training the parish recruits. Nobles were able to raise regiments, which usually bore their name as colonel, and they could appoint company commanders, but the lieutenant colonel and sergeant major of the regiment, and the lieutenant and sergeant of each company, were to be professional soldiers. The returning soldiers also brought expertise in fortification and trace italliene fortifications were added at Leith, Burntisland and Greenock. They would play a major role in the siege of Edinburgh in 1650.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the council can only {{be compared with the}} quite unique and unusual {{composition of}} the German upper house, the Bundesrat. Membership of the Bundesrat is limited to members of the governments of the states of Germany and can <b>be</b> <b>recalled</b> by those governments {{in the same manner as}} the EU's Council. They retain their state role while sitting in the Bundesrat and if their term ends when they are recalled by their state governments (who are solely responsible for their appointment) or they cease to sit in their state government. Hence they also are not elected at the same time and the body as a whole cannot be dissolved like most parliaments. As government representatives, members do not vote as individual members but in state blocks, rather than political alignment, to their state governments' agreed line. Each state has unequal voting powers based on population, with an absolute majority required for decisions. Likewise, the presidency rotates equally between members, though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council. However, unlike the EU's Council, the Bundesrat does not vary its composition depending on the topic being discussed. They both bear similar criticisms, because of the interference, of executives in the legislative process.|$|E
