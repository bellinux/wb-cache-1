5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E

25|$|Everything {{has either}} a price or a dignity. Whatever has a price can be {{replaced}} by something else as its equivalent; on the other hand, whatever is above all price, and therefore admits of no equivalent, has a dignity. But that which constitutes the condition under which alone something can <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> in itself does not have mere relative worth, i.e., price, but an intrinsic worth, i.e., a dignity.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{physically}} possible elements is unknown. A low {{estimate is that}} the periodic table may end soon after the island of stability, {{which is expected to}} center on Z = 126, as the extension of the periodic and nuclides tables is restricted by the proton and the neutron drip lines; some, such as Walter Greiner, predicted that there may not <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> to the periodic table. Other predictions of an end to the periodic table include Z = 128 (John Emsley) and Z = 155 (Albert Khazan).|$|E

25|$|With {{the defeat}} of Yugoslavia, Trifunović-Birčanin fled to Kolašin in Montenegro {{before moving to the}} Italian-controlled city of Split in October 1941. The Chetnik {{movement}} was openly and deeply hostile to the nascent Yugoslav Partisans, and this led to Chetnik commanders negotiating a series of local co-operation agreements with Italian occupying forces, based on the strong mutual wish that the Partisan insurrection be extinguished. In essence, these agreements were that Italian and Chetnik forces would leave one another alone, and in return there would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> to persecution of Serbs by the Italians. One such Chetnik-Italian agreement was concluded at a meeting in Split on 20 October 1941 by Trifunović-Birčanin, Dobroslav Jevđević, a leading Chetnik in the inter-war kingdom, and Angelo de Matteis, head of the information division of the Italian 6th Army Corps. Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović was aware of the collaborationist arrangements entered by Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin and condoned them. In addition to Jevđević, with whom he worked closely on liaison with the Italian forces, Trifunović-Birčanin's subordinate commanders included Momčilo Đujić (northern Dalmatia), Ilija Mihić and Slavko Bjelajac (Lika), and Petar Baćović (Herzegovina and southeastern Bosnia).|$|E
25|$|On 5 November 2006, a {{group of}} Muslims {{gathered}} outside the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes, Silibin, {{in the town of}} Ipoh, Perak to protest an alleged conversion of Muslim Malays out of Islam. The allegation was spread via a text message that claimed the church would baptise {{a group of}} Muslim Malays. The message proved to be false as the church celebrated only a Holy Communion service for 110 Indian children. The message further alleged that a famous Malaysian sportsman Azhar Mansor was leaving Islam to embrace Christianity. The police had traced the message to a lady who had met Harussani Zakaria, mufti of the state of Perak in a meeting. He has stated that the message was to remain {{within the confines of the}} meeting but had made no attempt to verify the authenticity of the message nor report it to the police as converting Muslims is illegal under Malaysian law. On 17 November, Azhar Mansor declared that he had not renounced Islam, and Umno president Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said that there should now <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> to the speculation.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. Geographic tongue does not usually cause any symptoms, {{and in those}} cases where there are symptoms, an oral parafunctional habit may be a {{contributory}} factor. Persons with parafunctional habits related to the tongue may show scalloping {{on the sides of}} the tongue (crenated tongue). Some suggest that hormonal factors may be involved, because one reported case in a female appeared to vary in severity in correlation with oral contraceptive use. People with geographic tongue frequently claim that their condition worsens during periods of psychologic stress. Geographic tongue is inversely associated with smoking and tobacco use. Sometimes geographic tongue is said to run in families, and it is reported to be associated with several different genes, though studies show family association may also be caused by similar diets. Some have reported links with various human leukocyte antigens, such as increased incidence of HLA-DR5, HLA-DRW6 and HLA-Cw6 and decreased incidence in HLA-B51. Vitamin B2 deficiency (ariboflavinosis) can cause several signs in the mouth, possibly including geographic tongue, although other sources state that geographic tongue is not related to nutritional deficiency. Fissured tongue often occurs simultaneously with geographic tongue, and some consider fissured tongue to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> stage of geographic tongue.|$|E

The Fur Army did not leave them alone and on 5 May a force of 500 men attacked the Anglo-Egyptian garrison at Abiad and four days later the telegraph post [...] east of Abiad was also attacked. On 12 May, an RFC reconnaissance aircraft flew over El Fasher dropping leaflets to the population.

500|$|With party support eroded, Treatt did {{not remain}} long as leader afterwards. On Friday 6 August 1954, Treatt {{announced}} that he would resign as leader on 10 August: [...] "Following the unsuccessful challenge for the Parliamentary leadership, it was expected that there would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> to activities so damaging to the party's morale and effectiveness. Unfortunately these activities have continued. The responsibilities of a political leader, particularly at the present time in New South Wales, are very heavy, and a leader giving of his best is infilled to receive the fullest support from every member of the party. This support has not been forthcoming, and without it the burdens on health and effectiveness would prove too much for any man." [...] At the following party meeting, after a deadlocked vote between Askin and Morton, Askin asked Murray Robson to nominate and subsequently he was elected to succeed Treatt. On 17 June 1955, Queen Elizabeth II granted him retention of the title [...] "The Honourable" [...] for life, for having served as Leader of the Opposition and the Executive Council of New South Wales.|$|E

2500|$|In 1165, {{hopes of}} Henry II's son's future {{accession}} to the French throne were dashed when Adèle {{gave birth to}} a son, Philip. Following this, the fragile Anglo-French peace ended. In 1167, Henry II marched into Auvergne, and in 1170 he also attacked Bourges. Louis VII answered by raiding the Norman Vexin, forcing Henry II to move his troops north, giving Louis the opportunity to free Bourges. At this point, John Gillingham mentions in The Angevin Empire that he believes Louis [...] "must have wondered whether there was ever going to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> to Henry's aggressively expansionist policies".|$|E

The implications of this for socio-political practice have {{to be worked out}} scientifically, and the necessary social and economic policies pursued with resolution. Any meaningful humanism must begin from egalitarianism and must lead to objectively chosen policies for safeguarding and sustaining egalitarianism. Hence, socialism.

Qatar cancelled its national day of celebration on 18 December 2016, in solidarity with Aleppo. German government spokesperson Steffen Seibert said that [...] "the cries for help of the people caught up in the fighting for the beleaguered city of Aleppo are a harrowing reminder to the world". He also urged: [...] "There must <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> to the killing and dying in Aleppo."

2500|$|On April 1, 1901, at the Malacañan Palace in Manila, Aguinaldo swore an oath {{accepting}} {{the authority of}} the United States over the Philippines and pledging his allegiance to the American government. On April 19, he issued a Proclamation of Formal Surrender to the United States, telling his followers to lay down their weapons and give up the fight. [...] "Let the stream of blood cease to flow; let there <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> to tears and desolation," [...] Aguinaldo said. [...] "The lesson which the war holds out and the significance of which I realized only recently, leads me to the firm conviction that the complete termination of hostilities and a lasting peace are not only desirable but also absolutely essential for the well-being of the Philippines." [...] The capture of Aguinaldo dealt a severe blow to the Filipino cause, {{but not as much as}} the Americans had hoped. General Miguel Malvar took over the leadership of the Filipino government, or what remained of it. He originally had taken a defensive stance against the Americans, but now launched all-out offensive against the American-held towns in the Batangas region. General Vicente Lukbán in Samar, and other army officers, continued the war in their respective areas.|$|E

Bohlen's response: [...] "I {{meant to say}} that the music of Modern Talking will live forever". Anders has kept the Modern Talking songs in his repertoire and produced songs in a similar vein for his solo records ("Independent Girl"). In 2006, he produced an album Songs Forever of swing and jazz versions of popular songs (including Modern Talking's first hit). Bohlen has written two autobiographical books about Modern Talking's history from his perspective. The first book sold a million copies in Germany. The sequel was heavily criticised for his unfairness towards the people he worked with. As a result of that, Bohlen withdrew from the public for a year until 2006, when he said he regretted putting out the second book. Anders had not been the only one pressing charges against Bohlen and demanding that sections of the book be modified. Frank Farian was also angered by Bohlen's literary output and released a book in which he tried to expose Bohlen as a fraud. Bohlen's first book was the basis of an animated comedy film called [...] The [...] contains the previously unreleased Modern Talking song [...] "Shooting Star" [...] which had been written for the Universe album.|$|E
