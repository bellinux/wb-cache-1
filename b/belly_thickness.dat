30|$|Ultrasound scans {{provide a}} {{non-invasive}} means to gain {{information about a}} muscle’s architecture. It has already been shown that plantarflexor morphometrics in CP are altered with respect to typically developing peers (TD) [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In case of the medial gastrocnemius (MG), {{in one of the}} spastic leg muscles displaying largest volumetric atrophy [15], there is evidence for reduced muscle belly length (L MB), cross-sectional area and muscle <b>belly</b> <b>thickness</b> (MT) [9]. However, achilles tendon length (L TEND) appears to be longer [10] while MG fascicle (bundle of skeletal muscle fibres) length (L FASC) seems shorter than in TD [11, 12]. Concerning the latter, L FASC, some inconsistencies have been reported [13, 14]. These discrepancies may be partly explained by difficulties in standardizing the musculoskeletal conditions, e.g., the degree of muscle stretch, during the assessment. On a microscopic level, spastic muscle fibres were also found to contain very long sarcomeres, which was interpreted as an inability to add sarcomeres in series with growth [16, 17].|$|E
30|$|Casts and {{orthotics}} {{are currently}} favourable for contracture management [18]. They should keep the plantarflexor’s muscle–tendon units (MTU) in a stretched position. This {{is assumed to}} increase L MB over time with a concomittant reduction in pathological equinus posture. Manual stretching of spastic MG can indeed transiently increase its L MB, L FASC, as well as L TEND [19], but the long-term effectiveness of manual stretch remains doubtful [18]. Cyclic stretches by an external, machine-driven device in combination with active training stimulated the MG fascicles to grow longer and become less stiff [20], positively demonstrating the MG’s adaptive potential. By contrast, most braces induce static, low load stretch over prolonged periods and also immobilise the muscle. Knowledge about the morphometric effects of chronic muscle stretch is primarily derived from healthy animals. When muscle from adult animal is immobilised in a lengthened position, sarcomeres {{have been shown to}} be added in series [21]. Muscle fibres in CP may thus grow longer in response to bracing. Yet, the fibres’ cross-section could also atrophy because of the immobilising effect [22]. In juvenile, developing animals, experiments point out that primarily the tendon, and not the muscle fibres, lengthens in response to stretched immobilisation [21, 23, 24]. Stimulated tendon growths could in fact reduce the stretch effects on muscle fibres and eventually induce sarcomere loss [23]. Such a scenario could theoretically decrease the MG muscle <b>belly</b> <b>thickness</b> [MT]. Because of cross-sectional atrophy and the pinnated fibre arrangement, the L MB could also decrease. In fact, it has been doubted that stretch-immobilization can promote muscle growth in children with CP [25].|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the time-course and recovery from eccentric (EC) exercise induced muscle damage by means of surface electromyography (sEMG), ultrasonography (US), and blood enzymes. Five subjects (EC Group) performed two bouts of 35 EC maximum contractions with the biceps brachii of their non dominant arm, five subjects were tested without performing EC (Control Group: CNT). The maximal isometric force (MVC) was measured. Force and sEMG signals were recorded during 80 % MVC isometric contractions. In EC and CNT subjects US assessment on non-dominant biceps brachii was performed; creatin kinase (CK) and lactic dehydrogenasis (LDH) plasma levels were also assessed. Force, sEMG and CK-LDH measurements were performed before EC and after it periodically for 4 weeks. The sEMG was analysed in time and frequency domains; a non-linear analysis (Lyapunov 1 st exponent, L 1) of sEMG was also performed. After EC, the MVC was reduced by 40 % on average {{with respect to the}} pre-EC values. A significant decrease in the initial frequency content, and in the MDF and L 1 decay (13 - 42 % less than the pre-EC values, respectively) was also observed. The sEMG amplitude (Root Mean Square, RMS) was unchanged after EC. The US revealed an increase in muscle <b>belly</b> <b>thickness</b> and in local muscle blood flow after EC. A complete recovery of all the considered parameters was achieved in two weeks. In conclusion sEMG analysis was confirmed as an early indicator of muscle damage. Muscle recovery from damage is followed by both sEMG and US and this may have useful clinical implications. Non linear analysis (L 1) was revealed to be sensitive to early sEMG modifications induced by EC as well as able to follow the post EC changes in the sEMG.

Criteria that were evaluated included: <b>belly</b> length, <b>thickness,</b> firmness, and slice yield; proximate and fatty acid analyses; iodine values; and sensory characteristics. There were no (P > 0. 08) DDGS × glycerol interactions on any criteria measured. Inclusion of 20 % DDGS in the diet decreased belly firmness (P < 0. 04), as measured by the belly flop test (fat-side down method). Twenty percent DDGS decreased (P < 0. 01) the percentage of myristic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, vaccenic acid, total saturated fatty acids, and total monounsaturated fatty acids. In contrast, 20 % DDGS increased (P < 0. 01) the percentage of linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, eicosadienoic acid, total polyunsaturated fatty acids, unsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratios, polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratios, and iodine values. The inclusion of 0, 2. 5, and 5 % glycerol in swine diets did not affect any measured criteria in this study. In conclusion, feeding DDGS at a level of 20 % decreased belly firmness and changed the fatty acid profile; however, it did not affect belly processing or sensory characteristics.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to study the {{echography}} visualization-based structural features of muscles and the wrist radial flexors for surgical treatment of 56 patients with the elbow flexion-and-extension contractures. The result of surgical treatment in the main group of patients consisted in the increase of the elbow extension angle. Muscle pattern was similar to a typical, normal ultrasound image. The most characteristic feature was {{a significant decrease in}} the muscle <b>belly</b> <b>thickness.</b> The thickness of fore-arm flexor muscular layer was 29, 2 % decreased for the brachium injured amounting to 16. 5 ± 4. 7 mm (P ≤ 0. 05), and that for the intact segment - to 23. 3 ± 2. 6 mm. In the immediate periods after treatment the signs of atrophy remained. It manifested by the significant decrease of the anterior muscle group thickness with regard to the intact segment values. The index of the echo intensity of m. biceps brachii in operated limb increased by 53. 7 % compared to preoperative values, reaching 22. 8 ± 2. 1 conv. u (P m. brachialis - 30 conv. u (P> 0. 05). Before the treatment in patients aged 8 - 13 years the relative strength of the forearm muscles was reduced by 12 % compared with those on the contralateral limb (P < 0. 05) according to t-test, and in the older age group - 20. 9 % (P < 0. 01). With increasing of movement range in the late periods after treatment were observed satisfactory contractile response of the upper limb muscles.

HouserThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the impact of 0 and 20 % dried distillers grains with soluble (DDGS) and increasing levels of glycerol (0, 2. 5 and 5 %) in grow-finishing rations on bacon quality and to determine the relationship between belly firmness and slicing yield for commercially produced bacon. A total of 84 barrows (PIC, initially 31. 03 kg) were fed corn-soybean meal-based diets organized in a 2 x 3 factorial with primary effects of DDGS (0 or 20 %) and glycerol (0, 2. 5, or 5 %) as fed. Belly length was measured from flank end to blade end. <b>Belly</b> <b>thickness</b> was measured at eight locations evenly spaced {{around the perimeter of the}} belly. Belly firmness was measured by centering bellies perpendicularly (skin side up and skin side down) over a stainless steel smokestick and measuring the flex between the edges on the ventral and dorsal edges of the belly. Bellies were injected at 12 % of the skinned belly weight resulting in a final concentration of 1. 74 % salt, 0. 5 % sugar, 0. 3 % sodium phosphate, 120 ppm sodium nitrite, and 500 ppm sodium erythorbate in the bellies. Bellies were cooked to an internal temperature of 53 oC, chilled, pressed and sliced for evaluation. Belly slice yield was calculated by determining the yield of # 1 type bacon slices. Proximate analysis and fatty acid analysis were evaluated by taking every 10 th bacon slice beginning from the caudal end to make a composite sample for each belly. Iodine value was calculated using the resulting fatty acid content results. Twenty bacon slices were removed from the belly one-third the length of the belly from the cranial end for sensory analysis and cooking yields. Sensory characteristics were evaluated on an 8 -point scale for brittleness, bacon flavor intensity, saltiness and off-flavor. There were no significant DDGS x glycerol interactions on any parameters measured (P > 0. 08). Inclusion of 20 % DDGS in pig diets decreased belly firmness (P < 0. 04) as measured by the belly flop fat side down method. Twenty percent DDGS decreased the percentage of myristic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, vaccenic acid, total saturated fatty acids, and total monounsaturated fatty acids (P < 0. 01). In contrast, 20 % DDGS increased the percentage of linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, eicosadienoic acid, total polyunsaturated fatty acids and decreased unsaturated: saturated fatty acid ratios, polyunsaturated: saturated fatty acid ratios, and iodine values (P < 0. 01). Statistical correlation analysis of belly processing characteristics showed that by increasing belly weight there will be an increase in smokehouse yields (R = 0. 81), increasing smokehouse yields will increase slice yield (R = 0. 71), increasing <b>belly</b> <b>thickness</b> results in firmer bellies (R = 0. 94) and increasing belly firmness will increase slice yields (R = 0. 60). Fatty acid content did not correlate with any belly processing characteristic (R < 0. 50). Iodine values were highly correlated with Total MUFA (R = 0. 83) Total PUFA (R = 0. 79), Total TFA (R = 0. 75), and UFA: SFA ratio, and PUFA: SFA ratios (R = 0. 83). The inclusion of 0, 2. 5 and 5 % glycerol in swine diets did not affect any measured parameters in this study. In conclusion, feeding DDGS at a level of 20 % decreased belly firmness and changed the fatty acid profile; however, it did not affect belly processing or sensory characteristics.

Pigs were randomly assigned to pens based on gender (14 barrow pens, 11 gilt pens, and 23 mixed-gender pens), with 25 to 28 pigs per pen. Previously, pens of pigs were assigned to treatments containing 0, 7. 5, or 15 % bakery by-product in a completely randomized design while balancing for initial BW and gender. On d 75, treatments were implemented {{to determine the effects of}} adding 50 ppm Zn from ZnO on finishing pig performance. A total of 1, 234 pigs (PIC 337 × 1050; average BW 224. 6 lb) were used in a 28 -d study. Pens of pigs were randomly assigned to diets with and without 50 ppm added Zn from zinc oxide (ZnO) and balanced by BW, bakery by-product, and gender. All diets contained 5 ppm RAC and 83 ppm Zn from ZnO provided by the trace mineral premix. There were 24 pens per treatment. Overall (d 75 to 102), no differences (P > 0. 22) in growth performance or carcass characteristics were observed when pigs were fed diets with 50 ppm added Zn compared with the RAC control. For pigs subsampled on d 84, pigs fed diets with 50 ppm added Zn had decreased (P < 0. 05) edge <b>belly</b> <b>thickness</b> compared with pigs fed the control. For pigs subsampled on d 102, pigs fed diets with 50 ppm added Zn had decreased (P < 0. 02) backfat thickness, belly weight, and edge belly thickness; a tendency for decreased (P < 0. 07) middle belly thickness; and increased (P < 0. 01) percentage lean compared with pigs fed the RAC control.

40|$|Purpose In {{children}} {{with cerebral palsy}} (CP), braces are used to counteract progressive joint and muscle contracture and improve function. We {{examined the effects of}} posi-tional ankle–foot braces on contracture of the medial gas-trocnemius (MG) and gait in {{children with}} CP while referencing to typically developing children. Methods Seventeen independently ambulant children with CP and calf muscle contracture (age 10. 4 ± 3. 0 y) and 17 untreated typically developing peers (age 9. 5 ± 2. 6 y) participated. Children with CP were analysed before and 16 ± 4 weeks after ankle–foot bracing. MG muscle <b>belly</b> length and <b>thickness,</b> tendon and fascicle length, as well as their extensibility were captured by 2 D ultrasound and 3 D motion capturing during passive, manually applied stret-ches. In addition, 3 D gait analysis was conducted. Results Prior to bracing, the MG muscle–tendon unit in children with CP was 22 % less extensible. At matched amounts of muscle–tendon unit stretch, the muscle belly and fascicles in CP were 7 % and 14 % shorter while the tendon was 11 % longer. Spastic fascicles displayed 32 % less extensibility than controls. Brace wear increased pas-sive dorsiflexion primarily with the knees flexed. During gait, children walked faster and foot lift in swing improved. MG muscle belly and tendon length showed little change, but fascicles further shortened (- 11 %) and muscle thickness (- 8 %) decreased. Conclusions Use of ankle–foot braces improves func-tion but may lead to a loss of sarcomeres in series, which could explain the shortened fascicles. To poten-tially induce gastrocnemius muscle growth, braces may also need to extend the knee or complementary training may be necessary to offset the immobilizing effects of braces...|$|R
40|$|The study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} immunocastration {{and the addition of}} ractopamine in the diet on the physical and chemical quality characteristics of belly and bacon from two crossbred pigs under different conditions of animal production, diet, management and slaughter. Five bellies for each treatment, totaling 60 bellies, were distributed in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement using two levels of ractopamine in the diet, 0 and 7. 5 ppm (for 21 days before slaughter) and three genders (gilts, immunocastrated males and castrated males) in a block design for the two genetics in different commercial farms. After carcass deboning, bellies were analyzed for length, width, firmness, <b>belly</b> <b>thickness,</b> fat thickness, chemical composition (protein, lipid, moisture, ash and carbohydrates), fatty acids profile, pH and objective color of meat and of fat, dry curing and process yields, during and after processing. After processing, analyzes of lean meat and fat percentage in bacon by digital image analysis, cooking loss, lipid oxidation, pH and objective color of meat and of fat (first day and 30 days after bacon processing) and sensory analysis for bacon odor and appearance were conducted. Bellies of barrow and immunocastrated pigs showed greater firmness, which can be an advantage for bacon processing and slicing. The immunocastrated animals had thicker bellies compared to the bellies of the gilts, however, the bellies of castrated did not differ from the others.
