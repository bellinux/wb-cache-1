25|$|To {{support the}} growing Lake Ontario sportfishing industry, the Salmon River Fish Hatchery {{was built in}} 1980 on Beaverdam Brook, a {{tributary}} to the Salmon River near Altmar. The hatchery receives its Chinook, coho and steelhead <b>broodstock</b> directly from river-running fish that are allowed directly into the hatchery. The facility also raises brown trout and Atlantic salmon using eggs received from other facilities. In total, the hatchery raises nearly three million young fish for release into New York's waters each year.|$|E
40|$|In the {{constantly}} growing Brazilian shrimp industry {{the evaluation}} of genetic relationships between <b>broodstocks</b> is an useful tool for shrimp culture management programs. We established the genetic relationships between five <b>broodstocks</b> of the white marine shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (Penaeidae) based on the sequencing of the mtDNA 16 S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) regions. Although no divergence {{was found between the}} <b>broodstocks</b> for the highly conservative 16 S rRNA gene, we did find an 8. 2 % distance between L. vannamei and the Farfantepenaeus subtilis. Analyses of the COI region showed genetic distances of only 0. 2 to 1 % between the <b>broodstocks,</b> which contrasted with the 10. 9 % mean distance found between L. vannamei and F. subtilis. The small genetic distance values obtained may be related to genetic drift or a founder effect that occurred during <b>broodstocks</b> establishment. The mtDNA analysis was able to characterize the genetic divergence between the <b>broodstocks</b> studied and could be helpful for defining better management strategies of these crustacea...|$|R

500|$|Oysters, mussels, clams, {{scallops}} {{and other}} bivalve species are grown with food materials that occur naturally in their culture {{environment in the}} sea and lagoons. One-third of the world’s farmed food fish harvested in 2010 was achieved {{without the use of}} feed, through the production of bivalves and filter-feeding carps. European flat oysters (Ostrea edulis) were first farmed by the Romans in shallow ponds and similar techniques are still in use. [...] Seed oysters are either raised in a hatchery or harvested from the wild. Hatchery production provides some control of the <b>broodstock</b> but remains problematic because disease-resistant strains of this oyster have not yet been developed. Wild spats are harvested either by broadcasting empty mussel shells on the seabed or by the use of long, small-mesh nets filled with mussel shells supported on steel frames. The oyster larvae preferentially settle out on the mussel shells. Juvenile oysters are then grown on in nursery trays and are transferred to open waters when they reach [...] in length.|$|E
500|$|The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is {{cultivated}} {{by similar}} methods but in larger volumes {{and in many}} more regions of the world. This oyster originated in Japan {{where it has been}} cultivated for many centuries. It is an estuarine species and prefers salinities of 20 to 25 parts per thousand. Breeding programmes have produced improved stock that is available from hatcheries. A single female oyster can produce 50–80 million eggs in a batch so the selection of <b>broodstock</b> is of great importance. The larvae are grown on in tanks of static or moving water. They are fed high quality microalgae and diatoms and grow fast. At metamorphosis the juveniles may be allowed to settle on PVC sheets or pipes, or crushed shell. In some cases, they continue their development in [...] "upwelling culture" [...] in large tanks of moving water rather than being allowed to settle on the bottom. They then may be transferred to transitional, nursery beds before being moved to their final rearing quarters. Culture there takes place on the bottom, in plastic trays, in mesh bags, on rafts or on long lines, either in shallow water or in the intertidal zone. The oysters are ready for harvesting in 18 to 30 months depending on the size required.|$|E

The hatchery complains 30 % mortality among fry and fingerlings while no mortalities was recorded among <b>broodstocks.</b> Parasitological examination revealed heavy infestation with Triochodina species (sp.) in all examined life stages at a prevalence rate 100 %. In addition, Gyrodactylus sp. was recorded in gills of fry, fingerlings and <b>broodstocks</b> {{at a rate of}} 5, 12, and 10 %, respectively. Kidneys and gills of all examined life stages showed heavy infestations with Myxosporean sp., with 100 % prevalence rate. Haemogregarina sp. was described in the blood of fingerlings and gill tissues of <b>broodstocks.</b> Additionally, Encysted metacerceria was observed in gills of <b>broodstocks.</b> The recovered parasites were demonstrated hisopathologically in the gill and kidney tissues of the examined fish. The histopathological examination revealed that the infested gills exhibited serious lesions such as hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the lining epithelial cells of the gill filaments, fusion and necrosis of secondary lamellae and vasodilatation. The lining epithelium of the renal tubules showed degenerative and necrotic changes with the presence of various developmental stages of myxosporidia. In conclusion, fry and fingerlings exhibited high mortalities, while no mortality was recorded among <b>broodstocks,</b> regardless the intensity of infestation and severity of pathological alterations which was intense in <b>broodstocks...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Broodstocks</b> require supplementation {{from outside}} sources {{regularly}} to prevent {{negative effects of}} closed populations. Domestication of <b>broodstocks</b> in hatcheries can reduce reproductive capabilities and alter other genetic characteristics.

50|$|Global {{production}} of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, requires over 3 billion eggs per year. This number is met because of <b>broodstocks</b> which undergo selection and conditioning in hatcheries. Trout have been reared artificially for over 80 years. Rainbow trout <b>broodstocks</b> are commonly manipulated to delay maturation and spawning {{time in order}} to provide eggs regularly and optimise supply. Artificial selection has favoured larger fish due to evidence of correlations between fish size and fecundity.|$|R
500|$|The {{artificial}} propagation of American paddlefish {{began with the}} efforts of the Missouri Department of Conservation during the early 1960s, and focused primarily on maintenance of the sport fishery. [...] However, it was the growing importance of American paddlefish for their meat and roe that became the catalyst for further development of culture techniques for aquaculture in the United States. [...] Artificial propagation requires <b>broodstock</b> which, because of the late sexual maturation of American paddlefish, are initially obtained from the wild and brought into a hatchery environment. [...] The fish are injected with LH-RH hormone to stimulate spawning. [...] The number of eggs a female may produce depends {{on the size of the}} fish and can range anywhere from 70,000–300,000 eggs. [...] Unlike most teleosts, the oviduct branches of American paddlefish and sturgeons are not directly attached to the ovaries; rather, they open dorsally into the body cavity. [...] To determine the status of progression toward maturation, ova staging is performed. [...] The process begins with a minor procedure that involves a small abdominal incision from which to extract a few sample oocytes. [...] The oocytes are boiled in water for a few minutes until the yolk is hardened, and then they are cut in half to expose the nucleus. [...] The exposed nucleus is examined under a microscope to determine stage of maturity.|$|E

After hatching, the baby salmon are typically grown to smolt stage (around six-months of age) before they are transferred to the sea cages or ponds. Most sea cage farming occurs in the Marlborough Sounds, Stewart Island, and Akaroa Harbour, while freshwater operations in Canterbury, Otago, and Tasman use ponds, raceways, and hydrocanals for growout operations.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to estimate the genetic variability level and distribution in Brazilian <b>broodstocks</b> of marine shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). Nine of the country?s largest hatcheries were evaluated using codominant and highly polymorphic microsatellite markers. The results obtained from genotyping of ten microsatellite loci are indicative of genetic variability that is compatible with that found in wild populations of L. vannamei in Mexico and Central America. A possible explanation is the highly diversified and relatively recent origin of the available <b>broodstocks.</b> Bayesian analysis detected a signal for five founding populations. The distribution of genetic distances partially reflects geographical location, and this information will be useful {{for the creation of}} new <b>broodstocks.</b> Therefore, L. vannamei genetic variability among nine of the largest national hatcheries can be considered high. 201...|$|R

50|$|<b>Broodstock</b> {{conditioning}} is {{the process}} of bringing adults into spawning condition by promoting the development of gonads. <b>Broodstock</b> conditioning can also extend spawning beyond natural spawning periods, or for production of species reared outside their natural geographic range with different environmental conditions. Some hatcheries collect wild adults and then bring them in for conditioning whilst others maintain a permanent breeding stock.Conditioning is achieved by holding <b>broodstock</b> in flow-through tanks at optimal conditions for light, temperature, salinity, flow rate and food availability (optimal levels are species specific).Another important aspect of <b>broodstock</b> conditioning is ensuring the production of high quality eggs to improve growth and survival of larvae by optimising the health and welfare of <b>broodstock</b> individuals. Egg quality is often determined by the nutritional condition of the mother. High levels of lipid reserves in particular are required to improve larval survival rates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Broodstock,</b> or broodfish, are a {{group of}} mature {{individuals}} used in aquaculture for breeding purposes. <b>Broodstock</b> can be a population of animals maintained in captivity {{as a source of}} replacement for, or enhancement of, seed and fry numbers.
