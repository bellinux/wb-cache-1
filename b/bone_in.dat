5|$|A {{handful of}} days before the Sugar Bowl, Tech wide {{receiver}} Ricky Hall broke a <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> his foot during practice and was considered unlikely to play. Hall was Tech's second-leading receiver, having caught 25passes for 398yards and three touchdowns. In addition, Hall was the Hokies' starting punt returner, and had returned 40kicks for 510yards and one touchdown, setting a school record for punt return yardage.|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} round of the Island Challenge, Sting went first. At first, Angus was having trouble {{adjusting}} to the ropes and did not place his first two <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> the holes fully, but soon he found his form and placed three <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> successfully as well as his first two halfway through. Angus then carefully succeeded putting more <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> before the time ran out and achieved eight <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> total. On Claw's turn, Rachael, who had one <b>bone</b> already put <b>in</b> as an advantage from the first round, quickly got her first few <b>bones</b> <b>in,</b> but then later dropped one. Rachael had some problems with the ropes as she often accidentally let go, but effortly continued scoring more bones. With only a few seconds left, Rachael dropped another bone that was to equal Angus' score, so Claw had seven <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> total. The winner was Sting by one point, who achieved another Sands of Time.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{its large}} size, the overall {{appearance}} of Deinosuchus was not considerably {{different from that}} of modern crocodilians. Deinosuchus had an alligator-like, broad snout, with a slightly bulbous tip. Each premaxilla contained four teeth, with the pair nearest to the tip of the snout being significantly smaller than the other two. Each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> the upper jaw) contained 21 or 22teeth. The tooth count for each dentary (tooth-bearing <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> the lower jaw) was at least 22. All the teeth were very thick and robust; those close {{to the rear of the}} jaws were short, rounded, and blunt. They appear to have been adapted for crushing, rather than piercing. When the mouth was closed, only the fourth tooth of the lower jaw would have been visible.|$|E
5|$|Digging for Fire is a 2015 American comedy-drama film {{directed}} by Joe Swanberg and co-written by Swanberg and Jake Johnson. It stars an ensemble cast led by Johnson, Rosemarie DeWitt, Brie Larson, Sam Rockwell, Anna Kendrick, Orlando Bloom and Mike Birbiglia. Johnson and DeWitt play {{a married couple}} who find a gun and a <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> the backyard of a house they are staying in.|$|E

5|$|Like rauisuchians, Batrachotomus {{walked with}} an erect posture, {{although}} the limbs were not located {{directly under the}} trunk. The limbs were not equal in length as the forelimbs were about 70% of the hindlimbs. The toe bones (phalanges) are poorly preserved and the only well known bone is a fifth metatarsal (<b>bone</b> <b>in</b> hindlimbs attached to the toe bones) which was hooked in shape. However, hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four toes and each hindlimb five.|$|E
5|$|Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, {{mineralization}} located {{inside the}} medulla {{of the long}} bones in gravid female birds) {{has been reported in}} at least one Allosaurus specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply calcium to shells. Its presence in the Allosaurus individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> dinosaurs, including this Allosaurus individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> this Allosaurus individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating gender in a specimen of Tyrannosaurus, {{it may be possible to}} ascertain whether or not the Allosaurus in question was indeed female.|$|E

5|$|Robben did {{not make}} his {{competitive}} debut for Chelsea until November 2004, as he was injured in a pre-season friendly match against Roma, breaking a metatarsal <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> his right foot in a challenge from Olivier Dacourt.

5|$|The film's {{plot was}} {{inspired}} by a similar incident in which Johnson discovered a gun and a <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> his backyard. Instead of a traditional script, he and Swanberg wrote an outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue. They cast the film mainly by contacting their friends and other actors who they knew had enjoyed their previous work. It was filmed over 15 days in Los Angeles County, California. Swanberg dedicated the film to filmmaker Paul Mazursky.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the {{temporal}} <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central {{area known as}} the vestibule contains two small fluid-filled recesses, the utricle and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled {{at right angles to}} each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E

5|$|When laying eggs, females grow {{a special}} type of bone between the hard outer bone and the marrow of their limbs. This {{medullary}} bone, which {{is rich in}} calcium, is used to make eggshells. A discovery of features in a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton provided evidence of medullary <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> extinct dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further research has found medullary <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> the carnosaur Allosaurus and the ornithopod Tenontosaurus. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus {{very early in the}} evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew {{it lightly}} first to subdue it. They {{typically}} have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown {{of these are}} composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs {{have one or two}} rows of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> the roof of the mouth.|$|E

5|$|Avialans diversified into a {{wide variety}} of forms during the Cretaceous Period. Many groups {{retained}} primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis, retained the long bony tails of their ancestors, the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened {{with the advent of the}} pygostyle <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> the group Pygostylia. In the late Cretaceous, around 95 million years ago, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell.|$|E

Watched by a crowd of 100,000 and a television audience of five million, Manchester City took an early lead through Joe Hayes, but Noel Kinsey equalised midway through the first half. Second half goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 3–1 victory. The match is best remembered for the heroics of Manchester City goalkeeper, Bert Trautmann, who continued playing despite breaking a <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> his neck in a collision with Birmingham City's Peter Murphy.|$|E
5|$|Both Abrictosaurus and Heterodontosaurus {{had very}} large eyes. Underneath the eyes, the jugal bone {{projected}} sideways, a feature {{also present in}} ceratopsians. As in the jaws of most ornithischians, the anterior edge of the premaxilla (a bone {{at the tip of}} the upper jaw) was toothless and probably supported a keratinous beak (rhamphotheca), although heterodontosaurids did have teeth in the posterior section of the premaxilla. A large gap, called a diastema, separated these premaxillary teeth from those of the maxilla (the main upper jaw <b>bone)</b> <b>in</b> many ornithischians, but this diastema was characteristically arched in heterodontosaurids. The mandible (lower jaw) was tipped by the predentary, a bone unique to ornithischians. This bone also supported a beak similar to the one found on the premaxilla. All the teeth in the lower jaw were found on the dentary bone.|$|E
