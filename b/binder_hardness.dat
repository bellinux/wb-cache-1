40|$|The industrially-important WC-Co {{composite}} materials provide a useful, albeit complicated materials system {{for understanding the}} combined influences on hardness and strength properties of the constituent WC particle strengths, the particle sizes, their contiguities, and of Co <b>binder</b> <b>hardness</b> and mean free paths, and in total, the volume fraction of constituents. A connection is made here between the composite material properties, especially including the material fracture toughness, and the several materials-type considerations of: (1) related hardness stress-strain behaviors; (2) dislocation (viscoplastic) thermal activation characterizations; (3) Hall-Petch type reciprocal square root of particle or grain size dependencies; and (4) indentation and conventional fracture mechanics results.

40|$|The {{short-term}} aging {{properties of}} neat bitumen were investigated using the rolling thin film oven test (RTFOT) to simulate aging during mixing, compaction and laying of asphalt mixtures, though the actual time of short-term aging {{in the field}} varies depending on haulage distances or paving times. The empirical tests, which include penetration and softening points, were conducted to ascertain the binder consistency. The RTFOT was conducted at 1630 C for 70 min, 85 min, and 100 min for bitumen 80 / 100 -penetration grade. Results from the study indicated that aging resulted in oxidation of the bitumen with increase in the stiffness of the binder. It was observed that aging increased the viscosity, decreased the binder penetration and increased the softening point of the neat bitumen. The results from the study also indicated that {{the magnitude of the}} short-term aging depends on the binder source, and aging time, as with longer aging time, the <b>binder</b> <b>hardness</b> and viscosity increases, thereby decreasing the penetration and increasing the binder softening point...|$|E
40|$|Carbamazepine was {{complexed}} with &#x 0026;# 946; -cyclodextrin in {{an attempt}} to enhance the solubility features of the drug. Phase solubility studies revealed a linear relationship between carbamazepine solubility and b -cyclodextrin concentration. The value of the stability constant (405. 42 M - 1 sub) calculated from the phase solubility diagram indicated that the complexes were adequately stable. Carbamazepine- &#x 0026;# 946; -cyclodextrin complex prepared by kneading method was used to produce dispersible tablets. A 2 3 sub factorial design was employed to investigate the effect of factors such as amount of <b>binder,</b> <b>hardness</b> and type of disintegrant on the tablet disintegration time and dissolution rate. Mathematical models containing only the significant factors influencing each response were generated using multiple linear regression and analysis of variance. The three main factors studied had a significant influence on both the response parameters. In addition to the main factors, the two-way interaction factors also showed a significant effect on the release rate. Type of disintegrant emerged as the main effect with the highest statistical significance affecting both the responses. Two formulations with a combination of factors within the experimental domain were developed and evaluated to validate the mathematical models. The predicted values were found to agree with the experimental values, confirming the forecasting ability of multi-linear regression and ANOVA...|$|E

40|$|Al 2 O 3 - 10 TiC {{composites}} were fabricated {{through the}} powder metallurgical process (mechanical milling combined with spark plasma sintering) {{with the addition}} of Ni/Nb as metallic binders. The effect of binder addition (Ni/Nb) on the processing, microstructure, and mechanical and tribological properties of the bulk-sintered composite samples was investigated. The microstructure of the composite reveals a homogeneous distribution of the TiC particles in the Al 2 O 3 matrix. However, the presence of Ni/Nb was not traceable, owing to the small amounts of Ni/Nb addition. Hardness and density of the composite samples increase with the increasing addition of Nb (up to 2 wt. % Nb). Any further increase in the Nb content (3 wt. %) decreases both the hardness and the wear resistance. However, in case of Ni as <b>binder,</b> both the <b>hardness</b> and wear resistance increases with the increase in the Ni content from 1 wt. % to 3 wt. %.

40|$|In this study, {{change in}} {{rheological}} and nanomechanical properties of asphalt due to aging is determined in the laboratory. Asphalt binders are aged using Rolling Thin Film Oven (RTFO), Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV), and draft ovens. Asphalt binder includes an unmodified base binder, Styrene-Butadiene (SB) and Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) polymer modified binders. Rheological properties such as viscosity, phase angle, shear modulus, creep compliance, stiffness, etc. are determined using Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) test, Multiple Stress Creep Recovery (MSCR) test, Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) test, Rotational Viscosity (RV) {{test and the}} Direct Tension (DT) test. Nanomechanical properties such as hardness and reduced elastic modulus are determined using a nanoindenter. Laboratory test results are {{expressed in terms of}} Aging Index (AI) defined by relative change in specific rheological or nanomechanical property of aged and unaged binder. As it was expected, binder rheological properties such as stiffness increases and phase angle and creep compliance decrease due to aging. Based on aging index defined by complex shear modulus (G*), increase in percentage of polymer results in decrease in the AI value for both SB and SBS modified binder. It means percent increase of polymer is not good for long term stability but may be good for fatigue. When comparing AI defined by G* of SB and SBS, it is shown that SBS has higher AI than SB. Aging index of RTFO condition binder does not vary as significantly as it varies in PAV conditioned sample. When comparing AI defined by G*, elastic modulus (G'), viscous modulus (G″), of oven aged sample, base binder ages more than modified binder and G' changes exponentially compared to the linear change of G″. At low temperature, the difference in creep compliance of unaged and aged binder is small compared to that at high temperature. This confirms that temperature significantly affects aging. Based on AI defined by BBR stiffness, original binder shows AI value similar to the modified binder. Again, SBS has higher AI defined BBR stiffness than SB. Based on ductility measured in DT test, it can be said as sample ages its ductility reduces. Nanoindentation is conducted on thin asphalt binder film deposited on glass slides. For both unmodified and modified <b>binders,</b> <b>hardness</b> and reduce modulus increase exponentially due to aging. Nanoindentation results show similar trend obtained by rheological test. Aging decreases the creep compliance defined by indentation depth, similar trend is observed in MSCR test by DSR. Civil EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|This Thesis was {{undertaken}} at the University of Nottingham {{which has a}} world class history of research into the fatigue of asphalt materials. The work described in this thesis {{was part of a}} research project funded by EPSRC, which attempts to gain a greater understanding of fatigue crack propagation in High Modulus Base (HMB) materials. Following on from Pell, Brown and Read this research has introduced the Compact Tension (CT) Test and Fracture Mechanics principles to examine the behaviour of HMB materials which had relatively little fatigue behavioural understanding on commencement of this research. This research investigated the fatigue cracking behaviour of twelve High Modulus Base (HMB) binders and mixtures. The research was instigated in response to the introduction of these HMB binders from France, as it was thought that these materials were not particularly well understood. In hindsight, this view was proven to be correct, as numerous problems have been experienced after using such materials. The Compact Tension test has been proved to be an effective means of testing bituminous mixtures for their crack propagation resistance, allowing the study of temperature effects. Crack propagation is dramatically affected by both <b>binder</b> <b>hardness</b> and temperature. In a pavement, the current approach to design, assuming a single fatigue characteristic, underestimates the life of 35 and 25 pen mixtures. However, it probably overestimates the life of 15 pen mixtures by not accounting for the effects of low temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of alternative binder systems for tungsten carbide (WC) based cemented carbides has again become of relevance due to possible changes in EU regulations {{regarding the use}} of Cobalt (Co). A framework for the ICME (Integrated Computational Materials Engineering) based Materials Design is presented to accelerate the {{development of}} alternative binder systems. Part one of this work deals with the design of the cemented carbide composite hardness. It has been shown that the intrinsic <b>binder</b> <b>hardness</b> is comparable to a bulk metal alloy and that based on the binder solubilities a solid solution strengthening model developed in this work can be employed. Using a method presented in this work the non-equilibrium, frozen-in binder solubilities can be obtained. Both the design of the binder phase and composite hardness is presented based on a general Materials Design approach. Part two deals with a multiscale approach to model the surface gradient formation. The experimentally missing data on liquid binder diffusion has been calculated using AIMD (Ab initio Molecular Dynamics). The diffusion through the liquid cemented carbide binder has to be reduced to an effective diffusion value due to the solid carbides acting as obstacles that increase the diffusion path. The geometrical reduction of the diffusion has been investigated experimentally using the SIMS (secondary ion mass spectroscopy) technique in WC-Nickel- 58 Nickel diffusion couples. The geometrical contribution of the so-called labyrinth factor has been proven by the combination of the experiments and in conjunction with DICTRA simulations using the precise liquid AIMD diffusivities. Unfortunately, despite the improved kinetic database and the geometrical diffusion reduction, the surface gradient formation cannot be explained satisfactory in complex cemented carbide grades. Additional, but so far unidentified, contributions have to be considered to predict the surface gradient thickness. QC 20170919 </p...|$|E

40|$|Alfalfa pellets {{have been}} known to {{generate}} dust and fines because of repeated handling and transport. During transport, this product loses or gains moisture which may affect its quality. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} manufacture pellets which are not prone to breakage but still can be palatable to animals. Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of chop quality, process and machine variables on the quality of alfalfa pellets. Three different qualities of alfalfa chops namely, low, intermediate and high quality, were used in the experiments. The chemical components and physical characteristics of alfalfa chops and grinds were determined. Pellets were made from alfalfa grinds and from alfalfa grinds mixed with <b>binders.</b> Durability and <b>hardness</b> of pellets were evaluated after manufacture and also after a period of storage at 28 °C and 90 % relative humidity. To study their compressibility, alfalfa grinds were compressed in a single pelleter and the tensile strength of pellets was determined by diametral compression test. Of four models considered, the Cooper-Eaton model provided the best fit to the particle compression data (volume or density of pellets versus applied pressure). Parameters determined from the Heckel and Cooper-Eaton models indicated that grinds from low quality alfalfa chops densified readily by particle rearrangement. Grinds from intermediate and high quality alfalfa chops produced pellets which required lower yield stress for plastic deformation (PY) and were, therefore, more compressible. The tensile strength of pellets increased with compression pressure during pellet formation and peaked at 100 MPa. Conditioner temperatures of 92 °C and above and conditioned grind moistures of 8. 5 to 10 % w. b. were ideal for pelleting. High durability pellets were produced in a high length-to-diameter ratio die. High temperature of pellets extruded out of the pelleter die resulted in high durability. The particle size of the grinds, die speed and pellet temperature were regressed to pellet durability, such relationships could be used for pellet mill control. Collagen protein, hydrated lime, lignosulfonate, bentonite and pea starch were the binders used with three chop qualities at inclusion rates depending on their cost. The durability of pellets made from low quality alfalfa chops was improved by addition of binders. However, the effect of binders on pellets made from intermediate and low quality chops was negligible. Hydrated lime and pea starch were identified as potential binders. Additional pelleting trials conducted showed that an inclusion rate of 0. 5 % of either hydrated lime or pea starch was adequate for improving the durability of low quality alfalfa pellets. Extending the conditioning time from the usual 17 - 22 s to 35 - 40 s did not affect binder performance nor did it improve the durability or hardness of pellets. Experiments were also conducted to determine the effect of high humidity storage on the physical characteristics of pellets. Moisture absorption data were modeled using the exponential model. Pellet durability decreased when the absorbed pellet moistures exceeded 10 or 12 %. Pellet hardness was sensitive to moisture change. In summary, the results from these experiments revealed that the physical quality of dehydrated alfalfa pellets was a function of both process and machine variables. Alfalfa chop quality also affected pellet quality and results showed that binder usage could help rectify variations in pellet durability...|$|R
