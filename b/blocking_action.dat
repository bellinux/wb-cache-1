25|$|The Abruzzo {{region has}} {{two types of}} climate that are {{strongly}} influenced by the Apennine Mountains, dividing the climate of the coastal and sub-Apennine hills from the interior's high mountain ranges.

Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers had attacked the German ships in the darkness, and when the German ships had turned westward to evade their attackers, Mauve continued in a southerly course, which placed his ships between the British and German battlecruisers. The British battlecruisers turned their attention to the pre-dreadnoughts, who in turn altered their course to the southwest in order to bring all of their guns to bear on the British ships. In the darkness, only muzzle flashes from the British ships could be seen; as a result Hessen and the other II Squadron ships held their fire.|$|E

40|$|Efonidipine, a {{derivative}} of dihydropyridine Ca 2 + antagonist, {{is known to}} block both L- and T-type Ca 2 + channels. It remains to be clarified, however, whether efonidipine affects other voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channel subtypes such as N-, P/Q- and R-types, and whether the optical isomers of efonidipine have different selectivities in blocking these Ca 2 + channels, including L- and T-types. To address these issues, the effects of efonidipine and its R(−) - and S(+) -isomers on these Ca 2 + channel subtypes were examined electrophysiologically in the expression systems using Xenopus oocytes and baby hamster kidney cells (BHK tk-ts 13). Efonidipine, a mixture of R(−) - and S(+) -isomers, exerted <b>blocking</b> <b>actions</b> on L- and T-types, but no effects on N-, P/Q- and R-type Ca 2 + channels. The selective <b>blocking</b> <b>actions</b> on L- and T-type channels were reproduced by the S(+) -efonidipine isomer. By contrast, the R(−) -efonidipine isomer preferentially blocked T-type channels. The <b>blocking</b> <b>actions</b> of efonidipine and its enantiomers were dependent on holding potentials. These findings indicate that the R(−) -isomer of efonidipine is a specific blocker of the T-type Ca 2 + channel...|$|R
