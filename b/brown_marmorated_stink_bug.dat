Despite the economic importance of pentatomid pests worldwide, their feeding behavior is poorly understood. Electronically monitored insect feeding (EMIF) technology is a useful tool in studies of feeding behavior of Hemiptera. Here we examined H. halys feeding behavior using an EMIF system designed for high throughput studies in environmental chambers. Our objectives were to quantify feeding activity by monitoring proboscis contacts with green beans, including labial dabbing and stylet penetration of the beans, which we collectively define as ‘probes’. We examined frequency and duration of ‘probes’ in field-collected H. halys over 48 hours and we determined how environmental conditions could affect diel and seasonal periodicity of ‘probing’ activity. We found differences in ‘probing’ activity between months when the assays were conducted. These differences in activity may have reflected different environmental conditions, and they also coincide with {{what is known about}} the phenology of H. halys. While a substantial number of ‘probes’ occurred during scotophase, including some of the longest mean ‘probe’ durations, activity was either lower or similar to ‘probing’ activity levels during photophase on average. We found that temperature {{had a significant impact on}} H. halys ‘probing’ behavior and may influence periodicity of activity.

50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>marmorated</b> <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> is {{a serious}} {{agricultural}} pest that has been readily causing damage to crops across the Eastern United States. They feed on {{a wide array of}} plants including apples, apricots, Asian pears, cherries, corn, grapes, lima beans, peaches, peppers, tomatoes, and soybeans. This makes them extremely versatile as they do not require a specific plant to feed on. To obtain their food stink bugs use their stylets to pierce the plant tissue in order to extract the plant fluids. In doing so, the plant loses necessary fluids that can lead to deformation of seeds, destruction of seeds, destruction of fruiting structures, delayed plant maturation, and increased vulnerability to harmful pathogens. While harvesting the plant's juices, the stink bug injects saliva into the plant creating a dimpling of the fruit's surface, and rotting of the material underneath.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>marmorated</b> <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> is {{more likely}} to invade homes in the fall than others in the family. The bug survives the winter as an adult by {{entering}} houses and structures when autumn evenings become colder, often in the thousands. In one home more than 26,000 stinkbugs were found overwintering. Adults can live from several months to a year. They will enter under siding, into soffits, around window and door frames, chimneys, or any space which has openings big enough to fit through. Once inside the house, they will go into a state of hibernation. They wait for winter to pass, but often the warmth inside the house causes them to become active, and they may fly clumsily around light fixtures. Two important vectors of this pest are the landscape ornamentals Tree of Heaven and Princess Tree.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Stink</b> <b>bugs</b> (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) {{comprise}} a critically important insect pest complex affecting 12 major crops worldwide including cotton. In the US, <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> damage to developing cotton bolls causes boll abscission, lint staining, reduced fiber quality, and reduced yields with estimated losses ranging from 10 to 60 million dollars annually. Unfortunately, scouting for <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> {{damage in the}} field is laborious and excessively time consuming. To improve scouting accuracy and efficiency, we investigated fluorescence changes in cotton boll tissues as a result of <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> feeding. Results Fluorescent imaging under long-wave ultraviolet light showed that stink bug-damaged lint, the inner carpal wall, and the outside of the boll emitted strong blue-green fluorescence in a circular region near the puncture wound, whereas undamaged tissue emissions occurred at different wavelengths; the much weaker emission of undamaged tissue was dominated by chlorophyll fluorescence. We further characterized the optimum emission and excitation spectra to distinguish between <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> damaged bolls from undamaged bolls. Conclusions The observed characteristic fluorescence peaks associated with <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> damage give rise to a fluorescence-based method to rapidly distinguish between undamaged and <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> damaged cotton bolls. Based on the fluorescent fingerprint, we envision a fluorescence reflectance imaging or a fluorescence ratiometric device to assist pest management professionals with rapidly determining the extent of <b>stink</b> <b>bug</b> damage in a cotton field. </p...|$|R
