Here, we present an R-based pipeline for differential analyses of HDCyto data, largely based on Bioconductor packages. We computationally define cell populations using FlowSOM clustering, and facilitate an optional but reproducible strategy for manual merging of algorithm-generated clusters. Our workflow offers different analysis paths, including association of cell type abundance with a phenotype or changes in signaling markers within specific subpopulations, or differential analyses of <b>aggregated</b> <b>signals.</b> Importantly, the differential analyses we show are based on regression frameworks where the HDCyto data is the response; thus, {{we are able to}} model arbitrary experimental designs, such as those with batch effects, paired designs and so on. In particular, we apply generalized linear mixed models to analyses of cell population abundance or cell-population-specific analyses of signaling markers, allowing overdispersion in cell count or <b>aggregated</b> <b>signals</b> across samples to be appropriately modeled. To support the formal statistical analyses, we encourage exploratory data analysis at every step, including quality control (e. g. multi-dimensional scaling plots), reporting of clustering results (dimensionality reduction, heatmaps with dendrograms) and differential analyses (e. g. plots of <b>aggregated</b> <b>signals)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{considers}} the <b>aggregate</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratio of amplified relaying channels, where the term aggregate {{refers to the}} inclusion of propagated noise terms generated as relaying terminals amplify both the information and noise portions of received signals.

40|$|Abstract Background Genomic aberrations {{can be used}} to {{determine}} cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Clinically relevant novel aberrations can be discovered using high-throughput assays such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) arrays and next-generation sequencing, which typically provide <b>aggregate</b> <b>signals</b> of many cells at once. However, heterogeneity of tumor subclones dramatically complicates the task of detecting aberrations. Results The <b>aggregate</b> <b>signal</b> of a population of subclones can be described as a linear system of equations. We employed a measure of allelic imbalance and total amount of DNA to characterize each locus by the copy number status (gain, loss or neither) of the strongest subclonal component. We designed simulated data to compare our measure to existing approaches and we analyzed SNP-arrays from 30 melanoma samples and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) from one melanoma sample. We showed that any system describing <b>aggregate</b> subclonal <b>signals</b> is underdetermined, leading to non-unique solutions for the exact copy number profile of subclones. For this reason, our illustrative measure was more robust than existing Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based tools in inferring the aberration status, as indicated by tests on simulated data. This higher robustness contributed in identifying numerous aberrations in several loci of melanoma samples. We validated the heterogeneity and aberration status within single biopsies by fluorescent in situ hybridization of four affected and transcriptionally up-regulated genes E 2 F 8, ETV 4, EZH 2 and FAM 84 B in 11 melanoma cell lines. Heterogeneity was further demonstrated in the analysis of allelic imbalance changes along single exons from melanoma RNA-Seq. Conclusions These studies demonstrate how subclonal heterogeneity, prevalent in tumor samples, is reflected in <b>aggregate</b> <b>signals</b> measured by high-throughput techniques. Our proposed approach yields high robustness in detecting copy number alterations using high-throughput technologies and has the potential to identify specific subclonal markers from next-generation sequencing data. </p...|$|R

Energy disaggregation can be formulated as a source separation problem where the <b>aggregated</b> <b>signal</b> is expressed as linear combination of basis vectors in a matrix factorization framework. In this paper, an approach based on Sum-to-k constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization (S 2 K-NMF) is proposed. By imposing the sum-to-k constraint and the non-negative constraint, S 2 K-NMF is able to effectively extract perceptually meaningful sources from complex mixtures. The strength of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through two sets of experiments: Energy disaggregation in a residential smart home, and HVAC components energy monitoring in an industrial building testbed maintained at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of S 2 K-NMF as compared to state-of-the-art decomposition-based disaggregation algorithms.

40|$|Carrier {{aggregation}} is {{the main}} feature of the Long Term Evolution advanced (LTE-A) standard to increase the spectral efficiency and communication bandwidth. It calls for wireless transmitters to be multi-band and multi-standard {{to meet the demands}} of various deployment scenarios. In addition, these transmit radios must efficiently amplify signals characterized with a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which is caused by advanced modulation schemes. These two factors highlight the need for the multi-band Doherty power amplifier (DPA), which allows the transmitter remain in high efficiency at back-off power levels and maintain that high efficiency over multiple frequency bands. In this work, a novel output combining network is presented for the dual-band DPA design with extended fractional bandwidth for carrier <b>aggregated</b> <b>signals.</b> The proposed output combiner employs a modified Pi-shape network, which enables the absorption of output capacitances from both the main and peaking devices and eliminates the need for phase offset lines which are major sources of bandwidth limitation in the existing multiband DPAs. In addition to performing the impedance inversion, the proposed combiner incorporates the biasing feeds and presents small low-frequency impedances to both the main and peaking transistors. The inclusion of the bias feeds and small low low-frequency impedance feature improves the linearizability of the DPA when stimulated with concurrent dual-band modulated signals. Lastly, by using the gain contour at the back-off power level, the non-linear AM-AM response caused by the varying input capacitance of the main transistor is mitigated. The proposed dual-band output power combiner and the back-off gain contour technique were applied to design of a dual-band two-way Doherty PA using the commercialized 25 W Gallium Nitride (GaN) transistor. Measurement of the two-way DPA shows a gain of 7. 5 - 9. 5 dB at 2. 05 - 2. 3 GHz and 9 - 11 dB at 3. 2 - 3. 62 GHz. The efficiency at 6 dB back off is greater than 49 % and 47 % across the two frequency bands. The linearizability of the dual-band DPA is validated using various carrier <b>aggregated</b> <b>signals.</b> The PA exhibits linear behaviour when driven by up to 80 MHz intra-band carrier <b>aggregated</b> <b>signal</b> and 20 MHz concurrent dual-band signal after DPD. Additionally, carrier <b>aggregated</b> <b>signals</b> usually lead to a PAPR value between 8 - 10 dB. The efficiency of classic two-way DPA deteriorates when dealing with such signals. To cope with the efficiency deterioration, a three-way DPA was designed. Simulations of the three-way DPA show that the gain is greater than 9 dB within the two frequency bands, 2. 05 - 2. 32 GHz and 3. 35 - 3. 65 GHz. The efficiency at 10 -dB back-off is greater than 40 % in the two frequency bands...|$|R

If differential privacy would be combined with wavelets only, the aggregator could, however, inspect a single smart meter’s consumption profile. A single profile is only protected by Gamma-distributed noise which does not provide differential privacy. Therefore, the mechanism achieving differential privacy must include a way to protect the summation operation by using a secure aggregation scheme, e.g., as described in section Multi-resolution secure aggregation.|$|R

However, traditional methods lose their power for biomedical data with non-Gaussian data types. We proposed innovative statistical models to derive more accurate <b>aggregated</b> <b>signals</b> to enhance the power by taking account of the special data types. Based on general exponential family distribution assumptions, we developed supervised logistic PCA and supervised categorical PCA for pathway based GWAS and rare variant analysis. A general framework, sparse exponential family PCA (SePCA), is further developed for aggregate analyses for various types of biomedical data with good interpretation. We derived an efficient algorithm to find the optimal <b>aggregated</b> <b>signals</b> by solving its equivalent dual problem with closed-form updating rules. SePCA is extended for aggregate {{association analysis}} in hierarchical levels for better biological interpretation, from groups to individual variables. Both simulation studies and real world applications have demonstrated that our methods can achieve higher power in association analysis and population stratification by taking good care of the correlations among the non-Gaussian variables in biomedical data. Another analytic issue in aggregate analysis is that biomedical data often have special stratified data structures due to the experiment design to solve confounding issues. We extended SePCA to low-rank and full-rank matched models to take account of the stratified data structures. The simulation study has demonstrated their capability of reconstructing more relevant PCs for the signals of interest compared to standard ePCA. A sparse low-rank matched PCA model outperforms the existing Bayesian methods in detecting differentially expressed genes for a benchmark spike-in gene study with technical replicates. In summary, our proposed statistical models for non-Gaussian biomedical data can derive more accurate and robust <b>aggregated</b> <b>signals</b> that help reveal underlying biological principles of human disease. Other than bioinformatics, these probabilistic models also have rich applications in data mining, computer vision, and social science areas...|$|R
