50|$|Until 2012 the {{blockchain}} technology underlying the first cryptocurrency - bitcoin (bitcoin) - was mostly {{considered as a}} revolutionary payment instrument. Nevertheless, later {{it became clear that}} the potential of this technology is much more than just a decentralized payment system. Currently there are many areas in which the <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> used. Although many projects are in the early stages, their implementation is only a matter of time.|$|E
50|$|Like the internet, <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> {{designed}} to be decentralized, with “layers,” where each layer is defined by an interoperable open protocol on top of which companies, as well as individuals, can build products and services. Bitcoin is the most notorious application of the blockchain. Bitcoin drives adoption of its underlying blockchain, and its strong technical community and robust code review process make it the most secure and reliable of the various blockchains.|$|E
50|$|Alternative blockchains, {{also known}} as altchains, are based on bitcoin {{technology}} in concept and/or code. The term encompasses all blockchains but bitcoin's main chain. Compared to bitcoin, these designs generally add functionality to the blockchain design. Altchains can provide solutions, including other digital currencies, though tokens in these designs are not always considered as such. Altchains target performance, anonymity, storage and applications such as smart contracts. Starting with a strong focus on financial applications, <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> extending to activities including decentralized applications and collaborative organizations that eliminate a middleman.|$|E

40|$|Technological {{advances}} {{over the}} last decade saw the rise of ICT and IoT, paving the way for the Supply Chain of Things. <b>Blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>was</b> one of the most recent and potentially most significant developments. <b>Blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>are</b> secure by design and can enable decentralization and visibility, with application in cryptocurrency transactions, historical records, identity management, traceability, authentication, and many others. However, successful adoption of such technology requires that the people, process and <b>technology</b> <b>are</b> ready. We propose a conceptual framework where the concept and technology can balance between positive and negative manifestations depending on human behavior, therefore determining the success of <b>Blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> application in supply chains. While both the concept and <b>technology</b> <b>are</b> relatively ready, human behavior is a challenge as it is known that people suffer from habits and perform poorly when exposed to large volumes of data. Therefore, the development of advanced supply chains with much greater visibility enabled by <b>Blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> must take into consideration people in order to succeed...|$|R
30|$|Therefore, <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> {{identified}} as a possible solution for this application (Bogensperger et al., 2018). Potential benefits are distributed data, the immanent validation mechanism and the low barriers {{for participation in the}} system.

30|$|In recent years, {{the status}} of {{cooperation}} and innovation has become increasingly important. Research {{on the behavior of}} production, education, and research organizations has attracted widespread attention. <b>Blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> considered as another subversive technology following cloud computing, wireless sensor networks, and big data. It is highly concerned by governments, financial institutions, and technology companies. <b>Blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> essentially a technical solution that collectively maintains a reliable database through a decentralized, high-trust way. Blockchain WEB technology has not only used in financial and other fields, but also has a great potential for application in the fields of production, education, and research. It has expected {{to play an important role}} in the establishment of a trust mechanism in the “Internet +” production, research, and innovation and promote education. Drawing on the experience in blockchain applications in the financial sector, the blockchain in the education sector mainly embodies six application modes: building individual science credit data, creating an intelligent education Taobao platform, developing a degree certificate system, and building a new ecology of open educational resources. Of course, due to the uniqueness and complexity of the trust field in the cooperation innovation of industry, universities, and research institutes, the application of <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> also faced with difficulties in the application, promotion, and operation of production and research, fuzzy ownership of educational big data, limited data storage space, and potential safety problems of blockchain technology.

40|$|Thing-to-thing {{payments}} {{are a key}} enabler in the Internet of Things (IoT) era, to ubiquitously allow for devices to pay each other for services without any human interaction. Traditional credit card-based systems {{are not able to}} handle this new paradigm, however <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> a promising payment candidate in this context. The prominent example of <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> Bitcoin, with its decentralized structure and ease of account creation. This paper presents a proof-of-concept implementation of a smart cable that connects to a smart socket and without any human interaction pays for electricity. In this paper, we identify several obstacles for the widespread use of bitcoins in thing-to-thing payments. A critical problem is the high transaction fees in the Bitcoin network when doing micro transactions. To reduce this impact, we present a single-fee micro-payment protocol that aggregates multiple smaller payments incrementally into one larger transaction needing only one transaction fee. The proof-of concept shows that trustless, autonomous, and ubiquitous thing-to-thing micro-payments is no longer a future technology...|$|E

40|$|<b>Blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> {{increasingly}} {{being seen as}} a general purpose technology with far reaching (institutional) effects. However, the ongoing empirical blockchain discussions on these effects are unstructured, due to high complexities. Both practitioners and researchers therefore struggle {{to get to the}} core of blockchain technology consequences. We use a Grounded Theory approach to map the ongoing blockchain discussion, which leads to our empirical core category that explains the core of the blockchain discussions: the disintermediation of trust in environments with highly institutionalized values. <b>Blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> thus often related to trust in our empirical data. However, following the conceptualization of Reliance – Trust and Control by Nooteboom, we show that blockchain technology should be more related to control, instead of trust. Futhermore, we argue that complete control is not always possible in blockchain- systems due to inherent character of decentralized decision making and thus, trust is still a factor in some blockchain environments. We conclude that <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> a technology that increases control over counterparties in a transaction, but decreases control from a systems-perspective. A transfer of power in the system therefore takes place in blockchain environments. We therefore present our final core category as: power transfer in environments with highly institutionalized values. This strong conceptualization of blockchain technology helps actors understand and discuss the essence of blockchain technology, and provides a much- needed empirical basis for further scientific research. Further development of this conceptualization of trust and control is needed to structure the ongoing blockchain discussions in both scientific literature and practice.

30|$|Equity {{crowdfunding}} via the Internet is a {{new channel}} of raising money for startups. It features low barriers to entry, low cost, and high speed, and thus encourages innovation. In recent years, equity crowdfunding in China has experienced some developments. However, some problems remain unsolved in practice. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology to ensure data security, transparency, and integrity. Because it cannot be tampered with or forged, the <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> deemed to have great potential in the finance industry. This study examines current problems {{in the practice of}} equity crowdfunding in China. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology,</b> this study further explores its practical applications in equity crowdfunding. 1) <b>Blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> may <b>be</b> a secure, efficient, low-cost solution for the registration of stocks and shares of a firm financed by crowdfunding; 2) <b>Blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> simplifies the transaction and transfer of crowdfunding equities, and thus facilitates their circulation; 3) <b>Blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> enables peer to peer transactions between investors and entrepreneurs, and solves the problems of regulatory compliance and security of fund management; <b>Blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> can <b>be</b> used to develop a voting system for crowdfunders, which enables them to be involved in corporate governance.

40|$|<b>Blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> has <b>been</b> raising enthusiasm over {{a variety}} of disciplines, from {{information}} technology and finance, to law and economics. Blockchain is a decentralized ledger, which facilitates trust and makes peer-to-peer transactions possible without a central third-party authority. Since 2008, cryptocurrency bitcoin has provided {{an example of how}} to implement a marketplace without a central authority by using <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology.</b> The fact that a broad range of economic and government activities rely on a centralized recording of the basic data of the economy makes this technology potentially significant. The utopian views of blockchain have argued that it will disrupt a wide range of markets by eliminating the need for intermediation. The objective of this thesis is to review the relevant literature related to the topic and provide a guide to what blockchain means in the field of economics. The published research is mapped through a three stage literature review, and based on this, it is organized in three main categories: monetary-, innovation- and governance-centred research. Even though the literature surrounding the topic is still in its infancy, the potential of <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>is</b> recognized by the literature. From the monetary viewpoint blockchain gives unprecedented flexibility in designing the attributes of currencies in terms of supply, value and exchange. From the innovation viewpoint, blockchain can create both increased efficiency of existing markets but also profits through entirely new markets. From the governance viewpoint blockchain facilitates trust and can be instrumental in democratizing economy more towards peer-to-peer production and consumption. Rather than a single <b>technology,</b> <b>blockchain</b> should <b>be</b> understood {{as a part of a}} greater digital transformation. In this case, blockchain can play a role in unlocking the potential of digital commons as well as the sharing and platform economy through a decentralized, universal record-keeping system...|$|R

On the one hand, networked microgrids shoulder the DSO’s burden of managing ADN operations {{by taking advantage of}} edge computing. The ADN energy management will accordingly be determined in a decentralized manner without posing any concerns with single-point failures and latency associated with centralized cloud-based schemes. On the other hand, SDN and <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> employed to secure intra- and inter-microgrid data flows, respectively.
