5000|$|The {{identification}} of a millisecond pulsar via a <b>blind</b> <b>search</b> of gamma-ray data alone provides hope that other gamma-ray sources with unknown origin can be identified as millisecond pulsars, especially given that radio pulses from PSR J1311-3430 were detected less than 10% of the time observed. Among known black-widow-type binary pulsar systems, PSR J1311-3430 has the shortest orbital period, and a mass constrained to be larger than 2.1 [...] This mass determination for the pulsar supports the existing notion that these systems are hosts to pulsars with large masses, and also provides constraints on the equation of state for neutron stars, strongly favoring [...] "stiff" [...] equations of state.|$|E

5000|$|Advanced wire-bond packages, unlike {{traditional}} Ball Grid Array (BGA) packages, {{have multiple}} pad rows on the die and multiple tiers on the substrate. This package technology has brought new challenges to failure analysis. To date, Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM), Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) analysis, and Real-Time X-ray (RTX) inspection were the non-destructive tools {{used to detect}} short faults. Unfortunately, these techniques do not work very well in advanced wire-bond packages. Because of the high density wire bonding in advanced wire-bond packages, it is extremely hard to localize the short with conventional RTX inspection. Without detailed information as to where the short might occur, attempting destructive decapsualtion to expose both die surface and bond wires is full of risk. Wet chemical etching to remove mold compound in a large area often results in over-etching. Furthermore, even if the package is successfully decapped, visual inspection of the multi-tiered bond wires is a <b>blind</b> <b>search.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} <b>blind</b> <b>search</b> on encrypted data, wherein servers are to perform a search service on the data {{without being able to}} discover the associated underlying search criteria. We focus on the case in which search is per-formed on an index of blinded (i. e. confidentiality-protected) keywords appended to the encrypted data or message. In re-cent years, several {{attempts have been made to}} provide such functionality using public-key encrypted keyword search (PEKS) schemes. We show that all PEKS schemes we are aware of fall to a generic dictionary attack which compro-mises the privacy of search keywords. This suggests revis-iting the existing PEKS model. Given this motivation, we distinguish <b>blind</b> <b>search</b> on incoming encrypted data (largely the focus of previous work) from <b>blind</b> <b>search</b> on outgoing encrypted data (which addresses novel applications), and provide both a new model for blind keyword search, and a specific proposal fitting the model. Our proposal is both (time- and space-) efficient, and prevents dictionary attacks by search servers. The simple idea is to build search to-kens using message authentication codes (MACs) keyed by user-specific strings (in essence, confounders). The keys are shared between the user and the party creating the search tokens, the latter being distinct from the search server. We also distinguish between systematic <b>blind</b> <b>search</b> (search on each incoming or outgoing message), and request-based <b>blind</b> <b>search</b> (search prompted by sporadic requests, as best re-sembles the only scheme we are aware of that provides <b>blind</b> <b>search</b> on public-key encrypted data, and does not fall to the aforementioned attack).

At lower resolution levels, "regions" of interest in the search space are singled out with a low computational cost. These regions are refined at intermediate resolution levels and only the most promising candidates are finally tested at the original fine resolution. The optimal search strategy is found by dynamic programming. We demonstrate the procedure for pulsar search from satellite gamma-ray observations and show that the power of the naive <b>blind</b> <b>search</b> can almost be matched with the hierarchical scheme while reducing the computational burden by more than three orders of magnitude.

40|$|Abstract. The Large Area Telescope on the {{recently}} launched Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly GLAST), with its large {{field of view}} and effective area, combined with its excellent timing capabilities, is poised to revolutionize the field of gamma-ray astrophysics. The large improvement in sensitivity over EGRET is expected to result in the discovery of many new gamma-ray pulsars, which in turn should lead to fundamental advances {{in our understanding of}} pulsar physics and the role of neutron stars in the Galaxy. Almost immediately after launch, Fermi clearly detected all previously known gamma-ray pulsars and is producing high precision results on these. An extensive radio and X-ray timing campaign of known (primarily radio) pulsars is being carried out in order to facilitate the discovery of new gamma-ray pulsars. In addition, a highly efficient time-differencing technique is being used to conduct <b>blind</b> <b>searches</b> for radio-quiet pulsars, which has already resulted in new discoveries.
