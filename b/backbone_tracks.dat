5000|$|The 2017 {{debut album}} SweetSexySavage, by American R&B artist Kehlani {{features}} {{a sample of}} the Rhian Sheehan track [...] "Waiting" [...] (co-written with Lotus Hartley). The sample is used as the <b>backbone</b> to the <b>track</b> [...] "Not Used To It" [...] (The album debuted at No.1 on the Billboard R&B chart, and reached No.3 on Billboard Top 200) [...] ).|$|R
50|$|The NTDR {{protocols}} {{consist of}} two components: clustering and routing. The clustering algorithms dynamically organize a given network into cluster heads and cluster members. The cluster heads create a backbone; the cluster members use {{the services of}} this backbone to send and receive packets. The cluster heads use a link-state routing algorithm to maintain the integrity of their <b>backbone</b> and to <b>track</b> the locations of cluster members.|$|R
50|$|The HWRF {{is a new}} {{computer}} model {{that will be the}} operational <b>backbone</b> for hurricane <b>track</b> and intensity forecasts by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The model will use data from satellite observations, buoys, and reconnaissance aircraft, making it able to access more meteorological data than any other hurricane model before it. The model will eventually run at an even higher resolution which will allow smaller scale features to become more discernible.|$|R

Extensive molecular dynamics simulations are performed to identify underlying mechanisms of the dynamical transition that corresponds to the onset of amplified atomic fluctuations in proteins. The {{results indicate that the}} number of water molecules within a cutoff distance of each residue scales linearly with protein depth index and is not affected by the local dynamics of the <b>backbone.</b> Keeping <b>track</b> of the water molecules within the cutoff sphere, we observe an effective residence time, scaling inversely with depth index at physiological temperatures while the diffusive escape is highly reduced below the transition. A depth independent orientational memory loss is obtained for the average dipole vector of the water molecules within the sphere when the protein is functional. While below the transition temperature, the solvent is in a glassy state, acting as a solid crust around the protein, inhibiting any large scale conformational fluctuations. At the transition, most of the hydration shell unfreezes and water molecules collectively make the protein more flexible...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the bicycle {{as a means of}} transport in a specific environment in Zlín, a town located in the valley. The <b>backbone</b> cycle <b>track</b> runs along the river Drevnice and it is connected to the city route. Both the cycle track and the city route provide two basic functions [...] transport and recreation. The user considers the flexibility and the safety when selecting round bike as a means of transport. It means the system must be integrated and it must be led through the space without collisions with other modes of transport. The bike must be secured at the place of its storage which is provided by the safety stands in Zlin. The recreation potential of the system can be increased by connecting to the bike path which runs along the Bata Canal and linking them with the interesting tourist targets around the city. Good awareness not only about tourist destinations but also about the overview of the entire network of cycle paths and lanes is ensured by Cyklo Zlín and it increases people's interest in issues of cycling...|$|R
2500|$|The deluxe {{version of}} MDNA has the song [...] "I Fucked Up", a slow pace tune where Madonna takes {{ownership}} {{for the reasons}} her marriage failed. In the concept song [...] "Beautiful Killer", a string arrangement reminiscent of Madonna's 1986 single [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] forms the <b>backbone</b> of the <b>track,</b> with the singer talking {{from the point of}} view of a victim and a murderer. [...] "Birthday Song" [...] is a goof off tune featuring M.I.A., containing a simple melody and a bassline with a punk style percussion. In the last song [...] "Best Friend", Madonna laments the loss of a lover who she compares to her best friend, and admits feeling guilty and remorseful.|$|R
5000|$|Idolator's Rachel Sonis {{labeled the}} song [...] "endlessly infectious". Chris DeVille of Stereogum called it [...] "a {{gorgeous}} thing to behold: thumping acoustic guitar figures, a crisply minimal disco drum beat, eerie background noise, thunderous bass, and twinkling pianos, all topped off by Grimes-reminiscent high-end vocal work. You're {{going to be}} hearing this one for a long time." [...] Pastes Scott Russell dubbed it [...] "hauntingly beautiful". Alex Siber of Pigeons and Planes said [...] "what sounds like a soft-spoken soul begins to soar, liberated, as the record progresses. Rogers breathes the crisp air of glacial plains, fueling a voice that's at once as delicate and powerful as the nature she describes and samples in the <b>track's</b> <b>backbone.</b> Each component of 'Alaska' pulses with the same heartbeat, amplifying itself like an echo chamber in which dancing is required and sadness is left at the door. What remains is an ear worm as infectious as it is earnest, one that took time to crystalize." ...|$|R
40|$|Per-flow {{network traffic}} {{measurements}} {{are needed for}} effective network traffic management, network performance assessment, and detection of anomalous network events such as incipient DoS attacks. Explicit measurement of per-flow traffic statistics is difficult in <b>backbone</b> networks because <b>tracking</b> the possibly {{hundreds of thousands of}} flows needs correspondingly large high-speed memories. To reduce the measurement overhead, many previous papers have proposed the use of random sampling and this is also used in commercial routers (Cisco's NetFlow). Our goal is to develop a new scheme that has very low memory requirements and has quick convergence to within a pre-specified accuracy. We achieve this by use of a novel approach based on sampling two-runs to estimate per-flow traffic. (A flow has a two-run when two consecutive samples belong to the same flow). Sampling two-runs automatically biases the samples towards the larger flows thereby making the estimation of these sources more accurate. This biased sampling leads to significantly smaller memory requirement compared to random sampling schemes. The scheme is very simple to implement and performs extremely well...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) methods {{were employed to}} study {{the interaction of the}} cytokine Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) with the α-subunit of its receptor (IL- 2 Rα), and to help understand the behavior of small molecule inhibitors of this interaction. Heteronuclear 1 H- 15 N HSQC experiments were used to identify the interaction surface of 15 N-enriched Interleukin- 2 (15 N-IL- 2) in complex with human IL- 2 Rα. In these experiments, chemical shift and line width changes in the heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra upon binding of 15 N-IL- 2 enabled classification of NH atoms as either near to, or far from, the IL- 2 Rα interaction surface. These data were complemented by hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange measurements, which illustrated enhanced protection of slowly-exchanging IL- 2 NH protons near the site of interaction with IL- 2 Rα. The interaction surface defined by NMR compared well with the IL- 2 Rα binding site identified previously using mutagenesis of human and murine IL- 2. Two low molecular weight inhibitors of the IL- 2 /IL- 2 Rα interaction were studied: one (a cyclic peptide derivative) was found to mimic a part of the cytokine and bind to IL- 2 Rα; the other (an acylphenylalanine derivative) was found to bind to IL- 2. For the interaction between IL- 2 and the acylphenylalanine, chemical shift perturbations of 15 N and 15 NH <b>backbone</b> resonances were <b>tracked</b> as a function of ligand concentration. The perturbation pattern observed for this complex revealed that the acylphenylalanine is a competitive inhibitor—it binds to the same site on IL- 2 that interacts with IL- 2 Rα...|$|R
