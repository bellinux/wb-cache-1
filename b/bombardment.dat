It was standardized as a <b>bombardment</b> group and redesignated the 509th <b>Bombardment</b> Group, Very Heavy, on 10 July 1946.|$|E

5|$|The Fifth Air Force had two {{heavy bomber}} groups. The 43rd <b>Bombardment</b> Group was {{equipped}} with about 55 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. Most of these had seen hard war service over the previous six months and the availability rate was low. The recently arrived 90th <b>Bombardment</b> Group {{was equipped with}} Consolidated B-24 Liberators, but they too had maintenance problems. There were two medium groups: the 38th <b>Bombardment</b> Group, equipped with B-25 Mitchells, and the 22nd <b>Bombardment</b> Group, equipped with Martin B-26 Marauders, {{but two of the}} former’s four squadrons had been diverted to the South Pacific Area, and the latter had taken so many losses that it had been withdrawn to Australia to be rebuilt.|$|E

The city itself suffered great damage during the war, with the bulk of direct damage occurring {{as a consequence of the}} 1991–92 <b>bombardment.</b> Direct war damage sustained by the city was estimated at a total of US$1.3billion. The damage was regularly recorded by 400 volunteers during the <b>bombardment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain diamond {{enhancement}} {{techniques are}} commonly used to artificially produce an array of colors, including blue, green, yellow, red, and black. Color enhancement techniques usually involve irradiation, including proton <b>bombardment</b> via cyclotrons; neutron <b>bombardment</b> in the piles of nuclear reactors; and electron <b>bombardment</b> by Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing color centers. The depth of color penetration depends on the technique and its duration, {{and in some cases}} the diamond may be left radioactive to some degree.|$|E

Johnson led the attack on the German naval installations at Kiel in May 1943 and the attack on the Ploesti oil fields in August 1943, for which the 44th <b>Bombardment</b> Group received Distinguished Unit Citations. He commanded the 14th Combat <b>Bombardment</b> Wing from September 1943 until May 1945.|$|E
5|$|During its height, the {{intensity}} of the <b>bombardment</b> was reported to reach as high as one shell per minute, and the artillery attacks were compounded by Yugoslav Air Force strikes against the city. According to Croatian sources, a total of 6,000 artillery shells were fired against Osijek in the period. Prior {{to the start of the}} <b>bombardment,</b> the civilian population of Osijek totaled 104,761 city residents and 129,792 municipal residents. These numbers were significantly reduced as civilians fled the fighting. It is estimated that only about a third of the population remained in the city by the end of November, with some sources placing the estimate even lower, suggesting that the population of the city was reduced to just 10,000 civilians during the most intense periods of the <b>bombardment.</b> Those who remained in Osijek through the fighting generally slept in bomb shelters.|$|E

The enemy ashore, preparing for a defense-in-depth strategy as at Iwo Jima, made no answer. Only air units provided a response, as several kamikaze raids were sent to harass the <b>bombardment</b> group. Texas escaped damage during those attacks. On 1 April, after six days of aerial and naval <b>bombardment,</b> the ground troops went ashore, and for almost two months, Texas remained in Okinawan waters providing gunfire support for the troops and fending off the enemy aerial assault. In performing the latter mission, she claimed one kamikaze kill on her own and claimed three assists. On 14 May she departed Okinawa for the Philippines.|$|E

He graduated from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the following year and returned to Langley as commanding officer of the 96th <b>Bombardment</b> Squadron. George flew to South America {{as a part of}} Air Corps goodwill flights in February 1938 and November 1939, and received for his participation the Order of the Southern Cross (Knight), from the government of Brazil. In 1940, George took command of the 2d <b>Bombardment</b> Group, which in 1937 had become the first unit equipped with the B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. Promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel on December 30, 1940, he also filled the position of Executive Officer of the 2nd <b>Bombardment</b> Wing from January 1941.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into the inner Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy <b>Bombardment</b> that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy <b>bombardment</b> lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury.

50|$|Although the Karelian Isthmus {{front was}} less active in January than in December, the Soviets began {{increasing}} <b>bombardments,</b> wearing down the defenders and softening their fortifications. During daylight hours, the Finns took shelter inside their fortifications from the <b>bombardments</b> and repaired damage during the night. The situation led quickly to war exhaustion among the Finns, who lost over 3,000 men in trench warfare. The Soviets also made occasional small infantry assaults {{with one or}} two companies. Because of the shortage of ammunition, Finnish artillery emplacements were under orders to fire only against directly threatening ground attacks. On 1 February, the Soviets further escalated their artillery and air <b>bombardments.</b>|$|R

5|$|Joined by Howe and re-designated Task Force 57, the British Pacific Fleet {{was again}} {{involved}} in operations in late March 1945, when it launched {{attacks on the}} Sakishimo-Gunto airfields, a task it repeated in early May. On 4 May 1945 King George V led battleships and cruisers in a forty-five-minute <b>bombardment</b> of Japanese air facilities in the Ryukyu Islands. As the Allies approached the Japanese homeland, King George V was dispatched in mid-July to join the US battleships in a <b>bombardment</b> of industrial installations at Hitachi. King George V fired 267 rounds from her 14-inch guns during this operation. The task force {{then moved on to}} Hamamatsu in southern Honshu, where it carried out a further <b>bombardment</b> of aviation factories.
