50|$|Without relay valves, {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the brake pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear service brakes concurrently with the front service brakes, resulting in a condition known as <b>brake</b> <b>lag.</b> To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a relay valve is installed near the rear service brake chambers. In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the relay valve for remote service brake application.|$|E

This, combined with the cabling required for multi-unit control, resulted in altogether seven cable connections between consisted units.|$|R
