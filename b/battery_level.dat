5|$|The Royal Engineers Signal Service, {{formed in}} 1912, was given {{responsibility}} for communications that included signal dispatch, telegraph, telephone and later wireless communications, from army headquarters to brigade {{and down to}} <b>battery</b> <b>level</b> for the artillery. For most of the war, the Army's primary methods of communication were signal dispatch (employing runners, messengers on horseback, dogs, and carrier pigeons), visual signalling, telegraph, and telephone. At {{the start of the}} war, the Army had a small number of wireless sets, which in addition to being heavy and unreliable, operated on longwave. In 1915, trench wireless sets were introduced, but the transmissions were easily intercepted by the listening Germans.|$|E
5|$|The Taken are {{protected}} by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's <b>battery</b> <b>level.</b> Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or {{wait for it to}} recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may recharge over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.|$|E
25|$|The {{front of}} the iPod Shuffle had buttons for Play/Pause, Next Song/Fast Forward, Previous Song/Fast Reverse, {{and up and down}} volume adjustment. On the reverse, it had a <b>battery</b> <b>level</b> {{indicator}} light (activated by a button) and a three-position switch to turn the unit off or set it to play music in order or shuffled. It plugged directly into a computer's USB port (either 1.1 or 2.0), through which it also recharged its battery, which has an expected life of around 12 hours. The USB plug is hidden beneath a cap. The unit also comes with a lanyard that attaches to the iPod Shuffle via an attached cap and this allows the user to wear the iPod Shuffle around his or her neck.|$|E

In large networks the nodes {{within the range of}} the base station forward data on behalf of the entire network. Under reasonable assumptions, as this burden significantly shortens the lifespan of these nodes, the network may become disconnected (and, hence, unusable) while considerable battery resources remain unused at the peripheral nodes. To alleviate this undesired effect, we investigate the effect of multiple <b>battery</b> <b>levels</b> to maximize the useful lifetime of the network. We demonstrate a powerful, yet attractively simple scheme to redistribute the total energy budget in multiple (but few) <b>battery</b> <b>levels.</b> We show by theoretical analysis, as well as simulation, that this substantially improves the network lifetime.

Building on the equipment level of the Futura, the Fairmont gained, automatic climate control air conditioning, trip computer, power rear windows, oil pressure and <b>battery</b> <b>level</b> gauges, front and rear illuminated footwells, electric aerial and full velour interior. Exterior wise, a more prominent chrome front grille, a larger bonnet bulge, and differently shaped headlamps distinguished the Fairmont from other EL models, as did 15-inch, 12-spoke alloy wheels. The Fairmont was also fitted with chrome insert side body mouldings and carried over the tail light lenses from the previous EF model.|$|E
500|$|Devers, Brewer, and Ward {{also argued}} for {{directing}} artillery from the battalion level {{rather than the}} <b>battery</b> <b>level.</b> [...] In their view, massing artillery and centrally controlling it from a brigade fire direction center enabled senior commanders to rapidly provide direct support to the areas on the battlefield where it was most needed. [...] McNair had advocated this tactic since World War I; he again agreed with the Gunnery Department, and worked to help implement this doctrinal change while also protecting the Gunnery Department from outside interference. [...] Over time, improvements to communications equipment and procedures and changes to doctrine enabled implementation {{of many of these}} changes, and they largely became the standard by which field artillery units conducted operations in World War II.|$|E

2500|$|High-intensity {{discharge}} (HID) {{lights were}} the brightest lights available for bicycles until recently eclipsed by the advances in LED lights. [...] They are very efficient, very bright, but expensive. They {{also tend to}} have high power consumption (although they use less power than halogens for higher output), so a relatively limited burn time. Otherwise {{they have the same}} advantages and disadvantages as rechargeable halogen systems, and like halogen systems they are designed primarily for off-road use, having rotationally symmetrical beams which cast as much light up as down. [...] An additional disadvantage compared with halogen or LED lights is that the HID lamp does not tolerate repeated strikes, and in many cases does not relight immediately after shutting down. [...] Likewise, should the <b>battery</b> <b>level</b> fall too low, the lamp will shut down rather than dimming. [...] But the longer battery life than halogens tends to negate these problems, as many riders simply switch the light on and leave it running throughout the ride.|$|E

ILMS require information about the departure time and length of EV drivers' upcoming trips to optimize the charging process depending on the availability of renewable energy in the grid. Inaccurate information may lead to insufficient <b>battery</b> <b>levels</b> or inefficient charging processes. In a field test during two weeks 60 participants predicted the departure time and trip length of their upcoming trips after having arrived at home with their own gasoline-powered cars. Actual mobility behavior was assessed by means of logbooks and GPS tracking devices. The results show that participants are on average able to accurately predict their departure times and trip lengths although for some outliers their prediction errors would potentially have led to insufficient <b>battery</b> <b>levels.</b> The type of trip (work, leisure, shopping) significantly influenced the accuracy of mobility predictions...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Bluetooth is a {{promising}} ad hoc networking technology. Although construction {{and operation of}} piconets are well defined in Bluetooth specifications, there is no unique standard for scatternet formation and operation. In this thesis, we propose a distributed and energy-efficient Bluetooth Scatternet Formation algorithm based on Device and Link characteristics (SF-DeviL) that is compatible with Bluetooth specifications. SF-DeviL handles energy efficiency using classes of devices, <b>battery</b> <b>levels</b> and the received signal strengths. SF-DeviL forms scatternets with tree topologies that are robust to battery depletions, where devices are arranged in an hierarchical order in terms of battery power and traffic generation rate. SF-DeviL is dynamic {{in the sense that}} the topology is reconfigured when <b>battery</b> <b>levels</b> are depleted, thereby increasing the lifetime of the scatternet. Unlike many of the algorithms in the literature SF-DeviL is also multihop, i. e., there is no requirement for each node to be in the transmission range of all other nodes. Pamuk, CananM. S...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{transmission}} range, data sensed by each sensor has to be forwarded in a multi-hop fashion before being delivered to the sink. The sensors closer to the sink have to forward comparatively more messages than sensors at {{the periphery of the}} network，and will deplete their batteries earlier. Besides the loss of the sensing capabilities of the nodes close to the sink, a more serious consequence of the death of the first tier of sensor nodes is the loss of connectivity between the nodes at the periphery of the network and the sink; it makes the wireless networks expire. To alleviate this undesired effect and maximize the useful lifetime of the network, we investigate the energy consumption of different tiers and the effect of multiple <b>battery</b> <b>levels,</b> and demonstrate an attractively simple scheme to redistribute the total energy budget in multiple <b>battery</b> <b>levels</b> by data traffic load.
