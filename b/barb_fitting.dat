50|$|A barb (or hose barb), which connects {{flexible}} hose or tubing to pipes, typically has a male-threaded end which mates with female threads. The {{other end of}} the fitting has a single- or multi-barbed tubeâ€”a long tapered cone with ridges, which is inserted into a {{flexible hose}}. An adjustable worm drive screw clamp (or other type of clamp) is often added, to keep the hose from slipping off the barbed tube. Barb fittings can be made of brass for hot-water applications, and plastic may be used for cold water; brass is considered more durable for heavy-duty use. The <b>barb</b> <b>fitting</b> may be elbow-shaped or straight.|$|E
5000|$|Hose barbs are {{cylindrical}} pieces {{or parts}} for attaching and securing of hoses (tubing). The barb-like rings on the cylindrical piece allow {{for an easy}} push-connection of flexible-plastic or rubber tubing that is not so easily disconnected. Hose barbs are used in machine perfusion and chemistry laboratory equipment. Hose <b>barb</b> <b>fittings</b> are small curved, bent or T-shaped pipes, hoses or tubes with hose barbs {{on at least one}} side used to join two or more pieces of piping (hosing, tubing) together.|$|R
