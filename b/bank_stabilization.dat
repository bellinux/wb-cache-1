Moreover, this paper also considers the effect, if any, of the Asian financial crisis on foreign and domestic bank behavior. Foreign banks. financial ratios differ from Korean banks with two notable exceptions: provisions for loan losses and loan growth. Before the Asian financial crisis, all banks. loans generally were unresponsive to Korean market conditions. Once the crisis began, foreign banks reduce total lending. Foreign banks increase and Korean banks decrease won-denominated loans when Korean GDP growth increases and when Korean interest rates increase. Finally, foreign banks. lending is sensitive to changes in home-country conditions. Asian financial crisis, Korean commercial <b>banks,</b> <b>stabilization,</b> foreign <b>bank</b> operations...|$|R

40|$|Canzoneri (1985) and Rogoff (1985) {{showed that}} {{imposing}} symmetric penalties on {{a central bank}} for deviations from an announced inflation target would reduce the Barro-Gordon inflation bias, but only {{at the expense of}} distorting the central <b>bank’s</b> <b>stabilization</b> effort. More recently, Walsh (1995) and Persson and Tabellini (1993) showed that a simple linear penalty on all observed inflation would eliminate the inflation bias without distorting the stabilization effort. We view this result as a methodological criticism of the Barro-Gordon model, and not a statement about the ease with which the bias can be eliminated. Thus, we begin by modifying the Barro-Gordon model to reintroduce the trade-off between inflation credibility and stabilization, even when linear inflation penalties are imposed. We then discuss how either type of penalty might actually be imposed, and ask whether inflation targeting (supported by one or the other type of penalty) is likely to bring a better resolution to the credibility-stabilization trade-off than the ERM.

40|$|AbstractA habitat {{assessment}} of 1, 707 km of rivers in the Federal State of Brandenburg, Germany, was undertaken using the desk-based ‘overview method’. This method includes {{the analysis of}} different sources such as topographic and thematic maps, reports, remote sensing data, and interviews with authorities. It compares actual habitat conditions with natural conditions, and assesses the human disturbances using a seven-step scale. Results show, that in Brandenburg more than 50 % of surveyed river units are heavily (class 5) to totally disturbed (class 7) and only slightly more than 20 % are undisturbed (class 1) to little disturbed (class 2). Main human disturbances are canalization, <b>bank</b> <b>stabilizations,</b> flood control, migration barriers, and agricultural and urban development in the floodplain.

40|$|The {{bailout of}} PT. Bank Century (BC) {{at the end}} of 2008 ignites many debates. If the Indonesian Central Bank had not bailed it out, would it have been a {{systemic}} disaster for Indonesian economic? BC’s total assets were not significant to the national banking asset. Why was it so important to bail BC out? This research wants to find answers to the following questions: 1) considering the internal problems of BC since 2005, was it worth to bail it out, and was the amount paid appropriate? 2) How bad was the internal problem in consideration of corporate governance theory, fraud theory, and in accordance with prudential banking principals? 3) Was the decision to bail out relevant for the national <b>banking</b> <b>stabilization?</b> 4) Was the failure of BC in 2008 a symptom of market failure, or a governance failure of BC and a regulation failure of the Indonesian Central Bank? This research uses descriptive qualitative method by in-depth analysis. The qualitative variables are classified to some significant factors which influence the decision to bail out. The result of this research shows that the historical performance, the corporate government and the fraud of the bank were not appropriately reviewed before the government decided to bail BC out. Even though the bailout was able to keep the national banking stabile at that time, the judgment of the decision was not purely economic. The non-economic factor was that the bank was too politically significant to fail...|$|R

40|$|The use of banked human tissue, {{obtained}} with informed consent after elective surgical procedures, represents a powerful model for understanding underlying mechanisms of diseases or therapeutic interventions and for establishing prognostic markers. However, donated tissues typically have varying times of warm ischaemia in situ due to blood arrest or cold ischaemia due to procurement and transportation. Hence, before using these tissues, {{it is important}} to carry out pre-analytical studies to ensure that they are representative of the in vivo state. In particular, tissues of the gastrointestinal tract have been thought to have low RNA stability. Therefore, this study aimed to determine if extended warm or cold ischaemia times and snap-freezing or <b>banking</b> in RNA <b>stabilization</b> solution affects RNA integrity or gene expression in human ileum mucosa. In short, ileum mucosa was collected for up to 1. 5 h and 6 h of simulated warm or cold ischaemia respectively. Subsequently, RNA integrity and gene expressions were determined. It was found that RNA integrity remained high over the course of warm and cold ischaemia examined and there were in general no significant differences between snap-freezing and <b>banking</b> in RNA <b>stabilization</b> solution. Following the same trend, there were in general no significant changes in gene expressions measured (MYC, HIF 1 α, CDX, HMOX 1 and IL 1 β). In conclusion, RNA in the ileum mucosa is maintained at a high integrity and has stable gene expression over the examined time course of warm or cold ischaemia when <b>banked</b> in RNA <b>stabilization</b> solution or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. As the average warm and cold ischaemia times imposed by surgery and the process of tissue banking are shorter than the time period examined in this study, human ileum mucosa samples collected after surgeries could be used for gene expression studies...|$|R

When committee members have heterogeneous policy preferences, welfare is greater under majority voting than under consensus decision-making. Furthermore, central bank communication under majority voting {{is more likely to be}} beneficial in this case. It is also shown that a chairman with stable policy preferences who carries significant weight in the monetary policy decision-making process is welfare enhancing.

Before the crisis a banking failure arose owing to the coexistence of a lemons credit market and high government borrowing. In a lemons credit market low credit risk firms switched from bank to nonbank finance, including trade credits and barter trade, generating an externality on banks'' interest rates. The collapse of the treasury bills market in the financial crisis triggered a change in banks'' lending behavior, providing initial conditions for banking development.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} monetary policy transparency in a simple static robust control framework. In this framework, we identify two sources of monetary policy uncertainty. First, we identify the uncertainty about the central <b>bank’s</b> inflation <b>stabilization</b> preferences, which affects the private sector’s inflation expectations and therefore the realized inflation and output. On the other hand, uncertainty means that central bank is unsure about its model, {{in the sense that}} there is a group of approximate models that it also consider as possibly true and its objective is to choose a rule that will work under a range of different model specifications. We find that robustness reveals the emergence of a precautionary behaviour of the central bank in the case of unstructured model uncertainty, reducing thus central bank’s willingness to choise a high degree of monetary policy transparency...|$|R
