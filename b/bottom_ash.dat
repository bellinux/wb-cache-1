In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled. In September 2007, Pulverised Fuel Ash was utilised as a filling material in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for the disposal of spent potlining from the smelter.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} the treatment of <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> deriving from combustion processes, said method comprising a step of storing and aging <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> and a step of grinding stored and aged <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes,</b> as well as a subsequent water washing step of said stored and aged <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes.</b> The water washing step is divided into two distinct washing stages, in every one of which water washing is combined with at least one screening step and one step of sand slime removal and hydrocyclone treatment and between which a further grinding step of the <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> hold by screening in the first washing stage is carried out. The water used to wash <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> is made to continuously recirculate in each washing stage after a step of clariflocculation with chemical treatment and fresh water is supplied in the second washing stage only. Thanks to these features, it is possible to reduce the content in polluting substances contained in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> within the limits provided by the present standards concerning their reuse as inert materials, by using a much smaller amount of fresh water than that used in known treatment apparatuses for <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> based on water washing.

5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions.

Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room.

40|$|The {{combination}} of energy production from biomass with phytoremediation opens perspectives for bringing land with moderate metal contamination into safe and beneficial use. Small scale fixed bed downdraft gasifier installations (150 kWe- 1 MWe) {{can be employed}} for on-site conversion of biomass to electricity and heat. To assess the fate of heavy metals, batch gasification operations were run in a small scale fixed bed downdraft gasifier (100 kW thermal power). The gasification of I kg of wood resulted {{in the production of}} 40 g of ashes, 1. 2 kWh of electricity and 9 MJ of heat. Per kg dry mass of willow wood, 31 g <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes,</b> 7 g cyclone ashes,. 2 g filter ashes, and 18 g DM of gasifier bed ashes were produced. Cd, Zn and Pb were enriched by a factor 7 - 100 in the fly ashes compared to the <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes.</b> Low mass recoveries (30 - 40 %) were found for Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb. This was mainly attributed to measurement uncertainties. 60 % and more of recovered Cd, Pb and Zn were present in the finer filter and cyclone ashes, while Cr, Cu and Ni were mainly found in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} the bed ashes. The scrubber placed after the hot cyclone has all essential role in intercepting the more volatile heavy metals before combustion of the gas. The <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> constituted the largest fraction and ideally should be recycled if limits for metal contents are met. Only Cd and Zn exceeded Flemish threshold values for use of this fraction as a fertilizer, albeit by a small margin.

40|$|To {{measure the}} content of silica in C 1 {{bituminous}} coal and its combustion products in the high-incidence area of lung cancer in Xuanwei, Yunnan Province, China and to investigate the relationship between high incidence of lung cancer among non-smoking women and silica produced naturally in C 1 bituminous coal in Xuan Wei. The C 1 bituminous coal widely used in the high-incidence area of lung cancer in Xuanwei was selected as experiment group, while the C 2 + 1, K 7, and M 30 bituminous coal that was mined and used in the low-incidence area of lung cancer in Xuanwei for more than 10 years were selected as control group. Fourteen paraffin-embedded cancer tissue samples from the non-smoking women with {{non-small cell lung cancer}} who were born in Xuanwei and were at least the 3 rd generation of the family living there were collected from the department of pathology, the third affiliated hospital of kunming medical university (tumor hospital of yunnan province). Titrimetric potassium silicofluoride method was used to measure {{the content of}} silica in raw coal and its <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> in 20 samples from the experimental group and control group. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the morphology of silica particles in C 1 bituminous coal and its <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes,</b> and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM-EDX) was used to analyze the microscopic composition. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe the morphology of silica particles in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> and coal soot of C 1 bituminous coal as well as the lung cancer tissue from the non-smoking women in Xuanwei, and transmission electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (TEM-EDX) was used to analyze the microscopic composition. The silica particles were separated from the coal soot and <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> and characterized by physical method. The silica content in C 1 bituminous coal and its <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> was significantly higher than that in C 2 + 1, K 7, and M 30 bituminous coal (P < 0. 05). The <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> of C 1 bituminous coal contained a large quantity of silica particles, mostly with microscale sizes. Silica particles were found in the soot of C 1 bituminous coal and the lung cancer tissue from non-smoking women in Xuanwei. The silica particles in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> were mostly 120 â¼ 500 nm in diameter, had various shapes, and contained such elements as iron, aluminium, calcium, and potassium; the silica particles in the coal soot were mostly nanoscale, ranging from 37 nm to 80 nm in diameter, had various shapes, with some in fibrous form, had non smooth surfaces, and contained such elements as iron, potassium, calcium, aluminium, and sulfur. In Xuanwei, the incidence of lung cancer among non-smoking women is high in the area where silica-rich C 1 bituminous coal is produced. There are silica particles enriched in both the combustion products (coal soot and <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes)</b> of C 1 bituminous coal and the cancer tissue from the non-smoking women with non-small cell lung cancer, with similar morphology and microscopic composition. We hypothesize that the silica particles from combusted C 1 bituminous coal in Xuanwei are mixed with indoor air and inhaled along with other suspended particles. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

All the UK biomass ashes investigated, whether from combustion of poultry litter, meat and bone meal, and straw, were alkaline and contained high concentrations of P, K, and Ca. The biomass air pollution control (APC) residues were enriched in K, Cl, S and Zn, and contained less lithophile elements, such as Al, Ca, P, Mg, Si, Ti, and Ba, compared to the <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes.</b> P appeared in: 1) <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> as apatite and other phosphates (potassium hydrogen phosphate and potassium iron phosphate in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> from combustion of poultry litter); 2) APC residues from combustion of poultry litter as potassium sodium calcium phosphate.
