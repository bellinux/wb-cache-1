5000|$|The Black Tower {{was built}} in the early 13th century as part of the {{fortification}} of the city. When the second fortification of Brussels was built {{at the end of the}} 14th century its original function became obsolete. Seeing that it wasn't destroyed historians believe it became private property. This would also explain why it survived so many centuries unharmed. In the 16th century, unlike other sections of the wall, the tower survived the creation of a new dock for the inland port of Brussels at the site where the St. Catherine Church is now located. Around the same time it was transformed into a tavern named: [...] "In the Tower". In 1888, when the entire street was sanitized mayor Charles Buls saved it from demolition. Architect Victor Jamaer restored the building and reconstructed the gable and the roof, as well as the <b>bent</b> <b>radius.</b> In the 19th century the tour was surrounded by a clothing store. On February 1, 1937 it officially became a state patrimonium and was classified as a historical monument. Nowadays it is surrounded by a hotel with modern-day supplies. A plaque reminds passers by of its historical importance.|$|E

A step index two-mode fiber Bragg grating is used as a transverse mode selector for CVB generation, while both the injection-locking technique and narrow bandwidth of the fiber Bragg grating lead to single-longitudinal-mode operation. The 3 -dB bandwidth of the laser output is measured to be 60 dB. Mode distribution and optical spectra of few-mode fibers with periodic modulated refractive index profile, namely the few-mode fiber Bragg gratings with <b>bent</b> <b>radius,</b> are investigated theoretically and experimentally, which provide a comprehensive exploration of CVB's generation...|$|E

Effective mode control can be achieved through these few mode fibers to achieve vector beam generation. Finally, reflection spectra of a few-mode fiber Bragg grating are calculated theoretically and then measured under different bending conditions. Experimental results are in good accordance with the theoretical ones. These few mode fibers show potential applications in generation of cylindrical vector beam both for optical lasing and sensing systems...|$|E

40|$|A {{continuous}} {{fuel level}} sensor using a side-emitting optical fiber is introduced in this paper. This sensor operates on the modulation of the light intensity in fiber, which {{is caused by the}} cladding’s acceptance angle change when it is immersed in fuel. The fiber is bent as a spiral shape to increase the sensor’s sensitivity by increasing the attenuation coefficient and fiber’s submerged length compared to liquid level. The attenuation coefficients of fiber with different <b>bent</b> <b>radiuses</b> in the air and water are acquired through experiments. The fiber is designed as a spiral shape with a steadily changing slope, and its response to water level is simulated.

40|$|A Q-enhancement {{strategy}} for racetrack microresonators is put forward. The design {{is based on}} the modification of the resonator geometry in order to mitigate the two main sources of radiation loss in the presence of curved waveguides: the discontinuities at the junctions between straight waveguides and the bent sections, and the continuous loss at the curved waveguide sectors. At the same time, the modifications of the geometry do not affect the versatility of coupling of racetrack resonators in integrated optical circuits, which is their main advantage over ring microresonators. The proposal is applied to the design of high-Q racetrack resonators for the silicon nitride CMOS-compatible platform having <b>bent</b> <b>radii</b> amenable for large-scale photonic integration.

40|$|Lipped channel beams (LCBs) are {{commonly}} used as floor joists and bearers in the construction industry. These thin-walled LCBs are subjected to specific local and global failures, one of them being web crippling. Several experimental and numerical {{studies have been conducted}} in the past to study the web crippling behaviour and capacities of different cold-formed steel sections under different concentrated load cases. However, {{due to the nature of}} the web crippling phenomenon and many factors influencing the web crippling capacities, capacity predictions given by most of the cold-formed steel design standards are either unconservative or conservative. Therefore a detailed experimental study was conducted to study the web crippling under End Two-Flange (ETF) and Interior Two-Flange (ITF) load cases based on the new AISI S 909 standard web crippling test method [1]. Finite element models were developed and validated using the test results. These models were then used in a detailed parametric study to investigate the web crippling capacities of a wide range of LCB sections including different sectional geometric parameters such as section depth, inside <b>bent</b> <b>radius,</b> thickness and bearing length. This paper presents the details of the numerical study of LCBs subject to web crippling under ETF and ITF load cases. Using the extensive web crippling capacity data obtained from both numerical and experimental studies, improved unified web crippling design equations were developed. Suitable web crippling design rules were also developed under the direct strength method format...|$|E

However, in most engineering applications pipeline networks generally contain one or more bends. In this article, we investigate the effect of bending radius on the natural frequencies of thin-walled pipes of circular cross-section using Finite Element Method (FEM). The FEM computation is accomplished using ANSYS. The boundary conditions at the ends are kept fixed. The modal analysis results are analyzed so as to determine the trend in natural frequency for a fixed mode of vibration for different <b>bent</b> <b>radii.</b> The objective of the analysis {{is to be able to}} infer from the results the effect of bend in terms of additional mass or stiffness.

These two trends cooperate toward the development of compliant substrates, which are designed to offload mechanical stress from the active circuit onto the substrate (and encapsulation). Compliant substrates make the circuit particularly rugged against rolling and bending.
