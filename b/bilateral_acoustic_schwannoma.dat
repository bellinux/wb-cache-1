40|$|INTRODUCTION: Schwannoma, also {{referred}} to as neurilemmoma, is a benign tumor of peripheral nerve arising from Schwann cells that form the neural sheath. These tumours along with neurofibromas form the two most common primary peripheral nerve tumours. Solitary lesions can occur sporadically in the general population but multiple neurof ibromas are distinctive feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and <b>bilateral</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannomas</b> are a feature of neurofibromatosis type 2. Schwannoma of ophthalmic interest is rare although it has been reported in relation with the orbit, and less frequentl y with the uveal tract and conjunctiva. Isolated eyelid schwannoma is extremely uncommon. PRESENTATION OF CASES: In the department of ophthalmology, G. S. L medical college, Rajahmundry, we came across a rare case of left lower eyelid schwannom...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Merlin, {{the product}} of the Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF 2) tumor-suppressor gene, {{is a member of the}} protein 4. 1 {{superfamily}} that is most closely related to ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM). NF 2 is a dominantly inherited disease characterized by the formation of <b>bilateral</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannomas</b> and other benign tumors associated with the central nervous system. To understand its cellular functions, we are studying a Merlin homologue in Drosophila. As is the case for NF 2 tumors, Drosophila cells lacking Merlin function overproliferate relative to their neighbors. Using in vitro mutagenesis, we define functional domains within Merlin required for proper subcellular localization and for genetic rescue of lethal Merlin alleles.

40|$|Melanotic Schwannoma (MS) {{is rarely}} seen and {{potentially}} malignant neoplasm that is categorized as {{a variant of}} Schwannoma. MS most frequently involves intracranial structures followed by posterior nerve roots in the spinal canal. Approximately 50 % of the cases with MS have psammomatous calcifications and this type of MS is related to Carney complex with autosomal dominant inheritance. Most cases of MS are benign, though 10 % of them are malignant with metastatic potential. MS mimics melanoma and the differential diagnosis should be made excluding other melanin producing neoplasms especially melanoma. Case 1. A 42 -year-old hypertensive male presented for checkup. He had a well-defined extraspinal oval lesion measuring 3. 5 × 2. 5 [*]cm near right adrenal. Case 2. A 22 -year-old female presented with neurofibromatosis- 2, <b>bilateral</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannomas</b> and café au lait lesions on sacrococcygeal region. She had an intradural extramedullary lesion measuring 6. 1 × 2. 0 [*]cm at L 1 - 2 level. MS is a rare neoplasm composed of Schwann cells and melanin pigment. These tumors are usually benign but they may become aggressive. The biologic behavior of MS is difficult to predict; the patients have to be followed up {{for a longer period}} due to its malignant potential...|$|R
40|$|Merlin, {{the product}} of the Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF 2) tumor-suppressor gene, {{is a member of the}} protein 4. 1 {{superfamily}} that is most closely related to ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM). NF 2 is a dominantly inherited disease characterized by the formation of <b>bilateral</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannomas</b> and other benign tumors associated with the central nervous system. To understand its cellular functions, we are studying a Merlin homologue in Drosophila.

Using in vitro mutagenesis, we define functional domains within Merlin required for proper subcellular localization and for genetic rescue of lethal Merlin alleles. Remarkably, the results of these experiments demonstrate that all essential genetic functions reside in the plasma membrane– associated NH 2 -terminal 350 amino acids of Merlin. Removal of a seven–amino acid conserved sequence within this domain results in a dominant-negative form of Merlin that is stably associated with the plasma membrane and causes overproliferation when expressed ectopically in the wing. In addition, we provide evidence that the COOH-terminal region of Merlin has a negative regulatory role, as has been shown for ERM proteins. These results provide insights into the functions and functional organization of a novel tumor suppressor gene...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether unenhanced high-resolution T 2 -weighted fast spin-echo MR imaging provides an acceptable {{and less expensive}} alternative to contrast-enhanced conventional T 1 -weighted spin-echo MR techniques in the diagnosis of <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannoma.</b> METHODS: We reviewed {{in a blinded fashion}} the records of 25 patients with pathologically documented <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannoma</b> and of 25 control subjects, all of whom had undergone both enhanced conventional spin-echo MR imaging and unenhanced fast spin-echo MR imaging of the cerebellopontine angle/ internal auditory canal region. The patients were imaged {{with the use of a}} quadrature head receiver coil for the conventional spin-echo sequences and dual 3 -inch phased-array receiver coils for the fast spin-echo sequences. RESULTS: The size of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannomas</b> ranged from 2 to 40 mm in maximum dimension. The mean maximum diameter was 12 mm, and 12 neoplasms were less than 10 mm in diameter. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>schwannoma</b> was correctly diagnosed on 98 % of the fast spin-echo images and on 100 % of the enhanced conventional spin-echo images. Statistical analysis of the data using the � coefficient demonstrated agreement beyond chance between these two imaging techniques for the diagnosis of <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannoma.</b> CONCLUSIONS: There is no statistically significant difference in the sensitivity and specificity of unenhanced high-resolution fast spin-echo imaging and enhanced T 1 -weighted conventional spin-echo imaging in the detection of <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannoma.</b> We believe that the unenhanced high-resolution fast spin-echo technique provides a cost-effective method for the diagnosis of <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannoma...</b>|$|R

Materials and Methods: A multi slice polystyrene head phantom was designed and fabricated for measurement of dose to cochlea during {{the treatment of the}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannoma.</b> The phantom has provision to position the MOSFET dosimeters at the desired location precisely. MOSFET dosimeters of 0. 2 mm x 0. 2 mm x 0. 5 μm were used to measure the dose to the cochlea. CT scans of the phantom with MOSFETs in situ were taken along with Leksell frame. The treatment plans of five patients treated earlier for <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannoma</b> were transferred to the phantom. Dose and coordinates of maximum dose point inside the cochlea were derived. The phantom along with the MOSFET dosimeters was irradiated to deliver the planned treatment and dose received by cochlea were measured. Results: The treatment planning system (TPS) estimated and measured dose to the cochlea were in the range of 7. 4 - 8. 4 Gy and 7. 1 - 8 Gy, respectively. The maximum variation between TPS calculated and measured dose to cochlea was 5 %. Conclusion: The measured dose values were found in good agreement with the dose values calculated using the TPS.

40|$|Schwannomas are {{tumors of the}} cranial, spinal, and {{peripheral}} nerve sheaths that originate from Schwann cells. Acoustic neurinomas are the most frequent cranial schwannomas. They might develop sporadically or {{in the context of}} neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF 2). Loss of part or all of chromosome 22 is frequently found in <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannomas,</b> suggesting that the NF 2 gene is a tumor suppressor gene involved in the genesis of these tumors. Only a few spinal schwannomas have been molecularly characterized so far, showing that chromosome 22 loss might also occur in these tumors. Here we present the molecular analysis of chromosome 22 in 23 <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannomas</b> and nine schwannomas of other locations (including other cranial nerves and spinal and {{peripheral nerve}}s). Most of these tumors were from sporadic cases. Multiple schwannomas of various locations were analyzed in two patients with NF 2. We found partial or complete monosomy for chromosome 22 in 22 % of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>schwannomas</b> and 55 % of the non-acoustic schwannomas. The tumors with partial monosomy included four with terminal deletions and one with a deletion of the centromeric part of the long arm of chromosome 22. The region between the beta B 2 - 1 crystallin locus (CRYB 2 A) and the myoglobin locus (MB) was commonly deleted in these tumors. Our studies suggest that a schwannoma-related tumor suppressor gene within this region, which might be the NF 2 gene, is involved in the development of schwannomas of various locations in the nervous system.
