You would not <b>believe</b> <b>how</b> curious I was about Herz, Liszt, Hiller, etc." [...] Liszt was in attendance at Chopin's Parisian debut on 26 February 1832 at the Salle Pleyel, which led him to remark: [...] "The most vigorous applause seemed not to suffice to our enthusiasm in the presence of this talented musician, who revealed a new phase of poetic sentiment combined with such happy innovation in the form of his art." ...|$|E

Sheila Nevins of HBO commented {{that she could not}} <b>believe</b> <b>how</b> aggressive the church had been.

[...] "Danny Says", the third track, was a lyrical depiction of what the band constantly went through while touring--soundchecks, autograph sessions, interviews, etc. The title [...] "Danny Says" [...] refers to the band's tour manager Danny Fields giving the members instructions, schedules, and demands. According to Joey, the ballad was inspired by Lou Reed, who had released the songs [...] "Candy Says" [...] and [...] "Caroline Says".

I still can't <b>believe</b> <b>how</b> well they pulled off the mystery. I did NOT see Aaron Echolls as the killer." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a glowing review, praising the Keith-Veronica dynamic, the conclusions to the story arcs, and the final sequence after it is revealed that Aaron is the murderer. [...] "It’s also an interesting choice to have the reveal come {{about two-thirds of the}} way through the episode, and have the episode end with a dramatic chase and fight scene. Veronica has so rarely been in direct personal danger that having Aaron Echolls chase and capture her, and having Keith show up for a brutal fight and rescue, is jarring.

[...] Slant Magazine's Matthew Cole stated that [...] "the duo volleys ball lines at each other on [...] "Otis" [...] and do call-and-response riffing on [...] "Gotta Have It," [...] sounding {{like a pair of}} hustlers who can't <b>believe</b> <b>how</b> much they've gotten away with. The chemistry between the two friends and self-described sibling rivals is conveyed perfectly on those two tracks." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters commented that several songs on the album are a [...] "hirlwind of excitement, particularly [...] "Gotta Have It", which finds Kanye and Jay spitting such decadent, pro-Black-laden material as [...] "Maybachs on bachs on bachs on bachs on bachs / Who in that? / Oh, shit, it's just blacks on blacks on blacks". Popdust's Emily Exton reported that that [...] "he two trade lines instead of verses in what results in a surefire example of what can happen when two pros team up." [...] The song peaked at number 69 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and at numbers 14 and 13 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs and Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs charts respectively.|$|E
500|$|In August 2008 [...] Tharin Robert Gartrell, 28, {{his cousin}} Shawn Robert Adolf, 33, and their friend Nathan Dwaine Johnson, 32, {{allegedly}} came to Denver, Colorado, specifically to kill then-Senator Barack Obama at the Democratic National Convention. The men came to Denver before Obama arrived there, and rented {{a room at}} the Hyatt Regency Tech Center, where they mistakenly believed Obama was staying (in fact, Obama was staying at another Denver hotel). Federal authorities began an investigation into the trio after they made alleged racist threats against Obama while taking methamphetamine in the hotel room. A woman present for their conversation, who was not identified by a police affidavit, told Colorado State Patrol officers they [...] "could not <b>believe</b> <b>how</b> close he was to becoming President". She claimed they spoke about killing the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, and that Adolf allegedly said, [...] "No nigger should ever live in the White House." [...] A woman in the group said it would be a [...] "suicide mission", and it would be best done by hiding a gun inside a hollowed-out television video camera, a method used in the 1992 Kevin Costner film, The Bodyguard. Security had already been increased for Obama due to low-grade fears of possible assassination attempts against the first African American major party presidential candidate. Authorities did not identify the woman who informed on the trio, nor did they disclose whether she was charged with a crime.|$|E
500|$|Played by Mike Reid, Frank {{had been}} a regular {{character}} in the serial from 1987 to 1994, and had appeared in a recurring role until 1998, when Reid agreed to return full-time. Frank's history on the show included a former marriage to another long-running matriarch, Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). Their history as lovers featured prominently in Peggy's narrative in 1998, when, after agreeing to marry Frank, Peggy was wrongly told that Frank and Pat were having an affair. A special two-hander episode aired in November 1998, featuring only Pat and Peggy for the entire duration. It concentrated on Peggy's reaction to the suspected affair, whilst simultaneously addressing Pat's unresolved history with Frank and the apparent destruction of Pat's own marriage to Roy (Tony Caunter), who had also responded badly to the rumours about his wife's infidelity. The episode, written by Tony Jordan, featured what the Sunday Mirror described as one of [...] "the most vicious fights ever filmed by a soap", with both throwing glasses at one another and Pat slapping Peggy across the face exclaiming [...] "You bitch!" [...] and Peggy responding by slapping Pat exclaiming [...] "You cow!". According to press reports, the fight scene between the characters was [...] "so powerful {{that it had to}} have scenes and dialogue cut so it could be screened before the 9pm watershed." [...] Barbara Windsor was reportedly bruised during the filming. Windsor commented, [...] "The writer didn't want a namby- pamby cat fight between two silly girls. We were throwing chairs and bottles and the adrenaline was at a high. When I saw the programme I couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>how</b> good it was. Pam and I were really proud." [...] The Sunday Mirror described it as: [...] "one of the most impressive episodes of all time". In the climax of the storyline, both couples resolved their differences, and their relationships remained intact.|$|E

Cisneros tapped Andrew Cuomo {{to serve as an}} assistant housing secretary, in charge of homelessness. He spent an evening touring a shelter and the streets in Washington D.C. [...] One night in late December 1994, he walked the streets of Minneapolis and St. Paul, talking to the homeless and later flopped for the night in a shelter in an effort to understand homelessness firsthand. [...] The next day he announced $7.3 million in HUD for five Minnesota state projects for homeless youth and families. [...] However, his efforts to alleviate the problem were often thwarted by a slow-moving bureaucracy.

2500|$|The {{following}} week, Mickelson won {{his fifth}} major title on July 21 at the Open Championship (often {{referred to as}} the British Open) Muirfield Golf Links in Scotland; the Open Championship is the oldest of the four major tournaments in professional golf. This {{was the first time in}} history that anyone had won both the Scottish Open and The Open Championship in the same year. Mickelson birdied four of the last six holes in a brilliant final round of 66 to win the title by three strokes. He shed tears on the 18th green after completing his round. Mickelson later said: [...] "I played arguably the best round of my career, and shot the round of my life. The range of emotions I feel are as far apart as possible after losing the U.S. Open.

It {{consists}} of vocal harmonies and guitar riffs, which according to PopMatters, {{is comparable to the}} work of Freddie Mercury and Queen. Gaga's inspiration behind the track was her father's heart condition, and her fear about his death. Gaga recalled that her [...] "dad used to call after he'd had a few drinks and I wouldn't know what to say. I was speechless and I just feared that I would lose him and I wouldn't be there. I wrote this song as a plea to him." [...] Produced by Ron Fair, [...] "Speechless" [...] was recorded with all live instruments such as drums, guitars, bass and piano played by Gaga. The album's fifth track, [...] "Dance in the Dark", talks about a girl being uncomfortable having sex with the lights on, so she would prefer to perform it in the [...] "dark".
