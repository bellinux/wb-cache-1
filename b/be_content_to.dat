5|$|By 5 December, the Australians {{had managed}} to {{stockpile}} enough supplies in forward areas to enable the 2/24th Infantry Battalion, which had been engaged in moving the stores, {{to be released from}} this task and thrown back into the fighting. In order to bypass the Japanese position, elements from the 2/23rd along with one company from the 2/24th carried out flanking manoeuvres {{to the west of the}} track were undertaken before the Australians established themselves in defensive positions short of Peak Hill. On 6 December, the remaining three companies of the 2/24th came up and as the Australians continued to advance towards Peak Hill they found considerable Japanese positions which had been abandoned. As movement was seen in Wareo, which was visible in the distance, an artillery bombardment was called in by the Australians. In the afternoon, the Australians cut the branch track that turned towards Kwatingkoo before an attack was put in on Peak Hill. The Japanese defences held and the attack beaten off, the Australians attempted to outflank to the north but they were prevented from doing so by the thick jungle and as the sun set, they had to <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> dig-in on the western approach to Peak Hill.|$|E

During the period 1955-1959, the Iraqi party was closer to Bakdash than at any other point. Al-Radi himself was not by inclination a theoretician, preferring to concentrate on party organisation and action; until 1961, he would <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> leave ideological questions primarily to Amir Abdallah, who was the party's dominant intellectual figure during this period and rather more cautious than al-Radi in his political approach.|$|E

25|$|Edmonds {{wrote that}} the German attack showed that with plenty of {{artillery}} and observation over British positions, the Germans could capture {{a small part of}} the British defences. A British counter-attack would need a similar mass of artillery and if the guns had to be transferred from elsewhere, a counter-attack would have to wait, allowing the Germans more time to consolidate. The large amount of German artillery near the ridge and sapping forward from their new positions, led Allenby to suspect that the Vimy Ridge attack was a preliminary for an attack on Arras. With the German involved in offensive operations in Russia and at Verdun, Haig thought that a bigger attack was unlikely. The 6th Army had a plan for a more ambitious attack but this needed another 12 divisions and 40 batteries of heavy artillery, which were not available. Wilson thought that the British could leave things as they were, on the assumption that the Germans would <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> consolidate their gains. If the Germans intended to attack again, he wanted to conduct a similar operation against the Germans, to re-capture the top of the ridge and the German positions down the reverse slope as far as their mine entrances.|$|E
25|$|Science is a {{magnificent}} force, {{but it is}} not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth's surface. Science has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; and now we are told that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars that may come in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings, and His teachings alone, can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world.|$|E

500|$|Russell's view {{of human}} nature, like that of Thomas Hobbes, is {{somewhat}} pessimistic. By Russell's account, the desire to empower oneself is unique to human nature. No other animals besides Homo sapiens, he argues, are capable of being so unsatisfied with their lot, that they should try to accumulate more goods than meet their needs. The [...] "impulse to power", as he calls it, does not arise unless one's basic desires have been sated. (Russell 1938:3) Then the imagination stirs, motivating the actor to gain more power. In Russell's view, the love of power is nearly universal among people, although it takes on different guises from person to person.

[...] Rothbard praised Malcolm X for [...] "acting white" [...] through use of his intellect and wit, and contrasted him favorably with the [...] "fraudulent intellectual with a rococo Black Baptist minister style, [...] "Dr." [...] King".

500|$|During the {{immediate}} post-UDI period Beadle, {{in his role}} as Chief Justice, occupied a unique position as he could speak directly with all the main playersâ€”Gibbs, Smith and Wilson. He became the main intermediary between them, and received a dormant commission from the UK government to replace Gibbs as Governor in case of necessity. He visited London in January 1966 and, according to Wilson's Attorney General Elwyn Jones, was [...] "scornful of the 1965 constitution". Some in Rhodesia criticised Beadle for going to London, or accused him of siding with Gibbs against Smith. The Chief Justice insisted that {{he was just trying to}} do his best for Rhodesia, a claim Smith accepted, saying Beadle [...] "thought more of his country than of his position". The UK Foreign Office remained wary, speculating in a January 1966 report that while the British government hoped to reclaim Rhodesia [...] "in such a way that policy and thinking is reoriented, racial attitudes changed, and the path to majority rule firmly laid," [...] the Chief Justice [...] "would <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> see a 1961-type constitution, without independence, remain for a long time".|$|E
500|$|No Limit was {{followed}} by Keep Your Seats, Please in 1936, which was again directed by Banks with Desmond returning as the co-star. Tensions arose in pre-production with Banks {{and some of the}} cast requesting to Dean that Beryl be banned from the set. Tempers had also become strained between Formby and Desmond, who were not on speaking terms except to film scenes. The situation became so bad that Dean avoided visiting his studios for the month of filming. The film contained the song [...] "The Window Cleaner" [...] (popularly known as [...] "When I'm Cleaning Windows"), which was soon banned by the BBC. The corporation's director John Reith stated that [...] "if the public wants to listen to Formby singing his disgusting little ditty, they'll have to <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> hear it in the cinemas, not over the nation's airwaves"; Formby and Beryl were furious with the block on the song. In May 1941 Beryl informed the BBC that the song was a favourite of the royal family, particularly Queen Mary, while a statement by Formby pointed out that [...] "I sang it before the King and Queen at the Royal Variety Performance". The BBC relented and started to broadcast the song.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1580s, with the {{development}} of English colonization schemes, initially in Ireland and later in North America, a new method to alleviate the condition of the poor would be suggested and utilized considerably over time. [...] Merchant and colonization proponent, George Peckham noted the then-current domestic conditions; [...] "there are at this day great numbers which Hue in such penurie & want, as they could <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> hazard their Hues, and to [...] one yeere for meat, drinke and apparell only, without wages, in hope thereby to amend their estates." [...] With this, he may have been the first to suggest what became the institution of [...] indentured service. [...] At the same time Richard Hakluyt, in his preface to Divers Voyages, likens English planters to [...] "Bees...led out by their Captaines to swarme abroad"; he recommends [...] "deducting" [...] the poor out of the realm. Hakluyt also broadens the scope and additionally recommends to empty the prisons and send them off to the New World. By 1619 Virginia's system of indentured service would be fully developed, and subsequent colonies would adopt the method with modifications suitable to their different conditions and times. English penal transportation would be implemented soon afterwards, and evolve into a subsidized government endeavor with the Transportation Act 1717.|$|E

500|$|Madness {{frequently}} discovers itself {{merely by}} unnecessary {{deviation from the}} usual mode of the world. My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, {{or in any other}} unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [...] Burney:â€“ Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was carried back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit [...] Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.'â€“ Johnson continued.
