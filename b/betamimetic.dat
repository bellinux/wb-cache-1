They may then take oral tocolytic maintenance therapy to prevent preterm birth and to prolong gestation. Objectives To assess the effects of oral <b>betamimetic</b> maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour for preventing preterm birth. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Register (June 2005) and MEDLINE (from 1966 to August 2003). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing oral <b>betamimetic</b> with alternative tocolytic therapy, placebo or no therapy, for maintenance following treatment of threatened preterm labour. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria and carried out data extraction and quality assessment of studies. Main results Eleven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. No differences were seen for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit when betamimetics were compared with placebo (relative risk (RR) 1. 29, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 64 to 2. 60; one RCT of terbutaline with 140 women) or with magnesium (RR 0. 80, 95 % CI 0. 43 to 1. 46; one RCT of 137 women). The rate of preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) showed {{no significant difference in}} four RCTs, two comparing ritodrine with placebo/no treatment and two comparing terbutaline with placebo/no treatment (RR 1. 08, 95 % CI 0. 88 to 1. 32, 384 women). No differences between betamimetics and placebo, no treatment or other tocolytics were seen for perinatal mortality and morbidity outcomes. Some adverse effects such as tachycardia were more frequent in the betamimetics groups than the groups allocated to placebo, no treatment or another type of tocolytic. Authors' conclusions Available evidence does not support the use of oral betamimetics for maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour. JM Dodd, CA Crowther, MR Dare and P Middleto...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{long-term}} therapy with salbutamol on renin activity, aldosterone levels and urinary sodium and potassium excretion in pregnant women are studied. Salbutamol was given intravenously {{in a first}} group of 18 patients in preterm labor, orally in a second group of 9 patients, whereas a third group of 17 patients was taken as control. No significant changes were observed in renin activity and aldosterone levels {{between the first and}} the fifth day of intravenous or oral therapy and in 24 -h sodium urinary excretion. Only potassium excretion showed a significant decrease (P< 0. 01) within 24 h {{from the start of the}} intravenous therapy, returning to control levels after 48 h. From these results, no replacement of potassium seems to be necessary in patients undergoing tocolytic therapy with <b>betamimetic</b> drugs...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Some {{women who}} have {{threatened}} to give birth prematurely, subsequently settle. They may then take oral tocolytic maintenance therapy to prevent preterm birth and to prolong gestation. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of oral <b>betamimetic</b> maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour for preventing preterm birth. SEARCH METHODS We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 9 November 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials comparing oral <b>betamimetic</b> with alternative tocolytic therapy, placebo or no therapy, for maintenance following treatment of threatened preterm labour. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria and carried out data extraction and quality assessment of studies. MAIN RESULTS We did not identify any new trials from the updated search so the results remain unchanged as follows. We included 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) {{with a total of}} 1551 women. We found no differences for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit when betamimetics were compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1. 28, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 68 to 2. 41; two RCTs of terbutaline with 2600 women) or with magnesium (RR 0. 80, 95 % CI 0. 43 to 1. 46; one RCT of 137 women). The rate of preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) showed no significant difference in six RCTs, four comparing ritodrine with placebo/no treatment and two comparing terbutaline with placebo/no treatment (RR 1. 11, 95 % CI 0. 91 to 1. 35; 644 women). We observed no differences between betamimetics and placebo, no treatment or other tocolytics for perinatal mortality and morbidity outcomes. Some adverse effects such as tachycardia were more frequent in the betamimetics groups than the groups allocated to placebo, no treatment or another type of tocolytic.

40|$|To characterise the phytotherapeutic tocolytic Bryophyllum pinnatum {{in vitro}} versus the {{conventional}} <b>betamimetic,</b> fenoterol, in human myometrium. STUDY DESIGN: Contractility (endpoints: area under the curve (AUC), amplitude {{and frequency of}} isometric force development) was measured in strips of term myometrium biopsied at caesarean section in 14 women and exposed to increasing concentrations of B. pinnatum versus +/- oxytocin 1 U/l. RESULTS: Inhibition of spontaneous contraction by B. pinnatum was concentration-dependent: 16 % at maximum concentration (10 (4) mg/l), or 53 % that with fenoterol 5 x 10 (- 8) mol/l. B. pinnatum increased contraction frequency by 91 % at constant amplitude and inhibited oxytocin-stimulated contractions by 20 % (AUC) at constant amplitude with slightly decreased frequency. Fenoterol decreased contraction AUC by 50 % with {{a significant decrease in}} frequency. CONCLUSION: Our in vitro data confirm the tocolytic activity of B. pinnatum observed in alternative medicine centres and may justify further clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comObjective: To assess the effects on maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of nifedipine (and other calcium channel blockers) administered as a tocolytic agent to women in preterm labour. Methods: Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Pregnancy and Childbirth Review Group were used. All published and unpublished randomised trials in which calcium channel blockers were used for tocolysis for women in preterm labour between 20 and 36 weeksâ€™ gestation, were considered. Main results: The systematic review includes 12 randomised controlled trials {{with a total of}} 1029 participating women. No trials were identified in which calcium channel blockers were compared with a placebo or no alternative tocolytic treatment. Calcium channel blockers appear to be more effective than <b>betamimetic</b> agents in prolonging pregnancy for 7 days or longer, are much less likely to cause maternal side-effects and are associated with reduced neonatal morbidity. Conclusion: Calcium channel blockers (especially nifedipine) can be considered safer and more effective tocolytic agents than betamimetics. James F.

40|$|Premature birth {{before the}} end of the 37 th week of {{gestation}} is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in newborns. Using drugs to suppress labour (tocolysis) does not prevent the causes of imminent premature birth, in most cases the birth can merely be temporarily delayed. In Austria, the drugs used in tocolysis are the <b>betamimetic</b> Hexoprenalin, a low cost drug which often leads to cardiovascular side effects, and the oxytocin receptor blocker Atosiban, which has fewer side effects but is more costly. The aims of the systematic review were to summarise (1) existing evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of imminent premature birth, (2) existing studies on the effectiveness and safety of tocolysis and, (3) health economic evaluations of the tocolysis drugs currently authorised in Austria. Evidence-based guidelines for tocolysis make the following recommendations: - Tocolysis is only indicated {{before the end}} of the 34 th week of pregnancy. - In routine practice only one cycle of tocolysis should be carried out in a 48 hour period. Neither a repetition of the treatment nor maintenance therapy are recommended. Using a combination of several tocolysis drugs is also not recommended. - When tocolysis is required, corticosteroids should be administered to help lung maturation, and, if necessary, the patient should be transferred to a neonatological centre. - Contraindications for tocolysis are increasing intrauterine infections, and fetuses that are unviable due to malformations. - Accompanying measures such as strict bed rest, hydration or sedation are not recommended in routine practice. Betamimetics were effective in delaying birth by 2 to 7 days compared to placebo. However, they did not change neonatal mortality and morbidity. No significant differences in effectiveness and safety were found between the different betamimetics. Under study conditions, Atosiban and betamimetics demonstrated the same effectiveness in terms of prolonging pregnancy, but Atosiban had fewer side effects. In order to avoid a side effect associated with <b>betamimetic</b> treatment, 6 women need to be tocolysed using Atosiban (NNT = 6). Atosiban failed to reduce morbidity and mortality to a greater extent than placebo or betamimetics. No health economic evaluations of Hexoprenalin, and just one of Atosiban could be identified, therefore a statement as to the cost-effectiveness of Hexoprenalin compared with Atosiban is currently not possible. Due to study heterogeneity in terms of design, intervention and data used, the cost-effectiveness of the tocolytics used in the studies cannot be assessed...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} whether ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels modulate the tocolytic effect of Î² 2 -adrenergic receptor (Î² 2 -AR) agonists (ritodrine and salmeterol) in early- pregnant (day 6) and late-pregnant (day 22) rat uterus in vitro, {{in order to}} examine the relation between the KATP channel sulphonylurea-binding regulatory subunit (SUR) expression and pharmacological reactivity of Î² 2 -AR agonists. Methods The tocolytic effects of ritodrine and salmeterol (10 - 10 - 10 - 5 M) on spontaneous rhythmic contractions were investigated cumulatively, alone, or {{in the presence of the}} KATP channel blocker glibenclamide (10 - 6 M) and the KATP channel opener pinacidil (10 - 9 - 10 - 7 M) after 5 -min preincubation. Results Î² 2 -AR agonist induced myometrial relaxation was inhibited by glibenclamide and enhanced by pinacidil on day 6, when SUR 1 expression levels were high. Neither glibenclamide nor pinacidil mediated tocolytic effect was measured on day 22. Conclusion Low expression of the KATP channels at the end of gestation may facilitate enhanced excitability and contractility in the rat myometrium. The combination of a <b>betamimetic</b> and a KATP channel opener will therefore not be of therapeutic relevance in the treatment of preterm delivery...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} whether maternal intravenous beta-mimetic tocolytic therapy {{increases the risk}} of autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and poorer behavioural and developmental outcomes. METHOD: Our study is a prospective case-control study among 90 children between 1. 5 and three years old. Cases (n = 46) were toddlers with <b>betamimetic</b> tocolytic exposure; control group toddlers (n = 44) were tocolytic untreated. Treated and untreated groups were also divided into subgroups: term and preterm delivered. The gestational age of tocolytic treatment start, the dose and duration of exposure in hours were obtained from obstetric medical records. The Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA), the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and the Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) tests were applied for evaluation of social, emotional problems, autism and developmental disorders. RESULTS: Term and preterm born toddlers treated tocolytically in utero didnâ€™t demonstrate a higher risk of autistic disorders or poorer behavioural and developmental results than controls. In the preterm group, the earliest start of tocolytic treatment was correlated with toddlers lower score of the Competencies Scale (p = 0. 009) and a higher score of the Problems Scale (p = 0. 048). Also, we concluded that preterm membrane rupture was associated with higher ASD risk in the untreated group (p = 0. 043). CONCLUSION: Exposure to betamimetics during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of autism, behavioural and developmental disorders...|$|E
40|$|Background: Data on the {{association}} between attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and atopic diseases have been inconclusive. Objectives: We assessed whether children with ADHD {{are more likely to}} have a history of atopy like asthma, allergic rhinitis or eczema than children without ADHD. Methods: A retrospective nested case-control study among children (6 - 12 years) using the IADB. nl prescription database was preformed. Medication proxies were used for the identification of ADHD and atopy. Cases were defined as children with at least two prescriptions of methylphenidate within 12 months. Cases were matched to four controls: patients without ADHD medication, on age, sex and area code. For each case and control, we recorded the presence of asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema in the 3 years prior to the inclusion. Asthma was defined as having at least three prescriptions of an inhaled corticosteroid or a short working <b>betamimetic,</b> allergic rhinitis was defined as having at least three prescriptions of a corticosteroid for nasal use and eczema was defined as having at least three prescriptions of ointments containing steroids or at least three prescriptions of calcineurin inhibitors, all within 12 months. We further assessed the parental ADHD and atopic diseases as a predicting parameter on developing ADHD in childhood. Conditional logistic regression analysis was applied to obtain odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Results: We identified 4257 cases and 17 028 controls. Asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema were more common in cases than controls with odds ratios of 1. 4 (95 %CI: 1. 3 - 1. 6), 1. 4 (95 %CI: 1. 1 - 1. 8) and 1. 3 (95 %CI: 1. 1 - 1. 5), respectively. Association of parental use of medication for atopy on receiving ADHD medication in the offspring (OR: 1. 1; 95 %CI: 1. 0 - 1. 2) was higher in cases compared to controls. Conclusions: This study suggests that atopic diseases are associated with the development of ADHD. Future studies should focus on the genetic component of {{the association}} to clarify the possible underlying mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: A {{wide range}} of tocolytic agents of {{different}} pharmacological groups are currently used with the aim to control labour. The present study was initiated to compare the tocolytic effect in vitro of the oxytocin-receptor antagonist Atosiban, the calcium entry blocker antagonist Nifedipine, active on smooth muscle and the <b>betamimetic</b> Fenoterol with predominantly ÃŸ 2 -adrenoreceptor activity on the uterus. Material and Methods: From March 2000 to March 2002 human myometrial tissues were taken from 49 healthy women undergoing elective cesarean at term {{before the onset of}} labor. Informed consent was obtained before biopsy. The research was approved by the local ethics committee. Myometrial strips were trimmed into 2 x 2 x 10 mm pieces. Placed under 20 mN tension they were allowed to start regular spontaneous contractions and to equilibrate for 60 minutes. Spontaneous contraction activity or activity under Oxytocin stimulation was determined over 15 minutes by measuring isometric changes in tension using a force transducer. This contraction level was used as reference activity. Atosiban, Nifedipine or Fenoterol were tested on spontaneous myometrial contractions as well as on oxytocin stimulated myometrial contractions. Each medication was administered in three different concentrations representing usual clinical therapeutic plasma concentrations: Atosiban: 250 ng/ml, 500 ng/ml, 1000 ng/ml, Nifedipine: 10 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml and Fenoterol: 500 pg/ml, 1000 pg/ml, 2000 pg/ml. The area under force-time-curve was determined over 15 minutes. Resulting contraction activity was compared to established reference activity and among the three substances. Results: All three substances, given at therapeutic plasma concentrations, inhibited spontaneous and Oxytocin induced contractions. Inhibition effects were independent of concentration levels for Atosiban and Fenoterol. 250 ng/ml Atosiban had the strongest effect on stimulated contractions with remaining contraction activity of 30 % (median) and was significantly more effective than Nifedipine (63 - 77 %) and 500 pg/ml Fenoterol (74 %). Nifedipine was the best tocolytic substance inhibiting spontaneous contractions with a remaining contraction activity of 2 - 32 % compared to 250 ng/ml Atosiban (86 %) and 500 pg/ml Fenoterol (73 %). Summary and conclusion: Nifedipine on spontaneous and Atosiban on Oxytocin induced contractions act as strong tocolytic substances on human myometrium of pregnant women in vitro. Atosiban&# 8217;s effect on uteral contractions {{even in the absence of}} Oxytocin suggest that it may be an inverse agonist. The present study indicates that with the introduction of the Oxytocin receptor antagonist Atosiban and the re-introduction of the Ca 2 + -channel blocker Nifedipine in clinical totcolytic practice, established tocolysis with betamimetics has to be re-evaluated...|$|E
