25|$|The Commonwealth Air Training Plan {{may also}} be {{regarded}} as the precursor of post-war international air training schemes in Canada, many of them involving personnel from other NATO powers. These include the NATO Air Training Plan (1950–1957) that graduated 4,600 pilots and navigators from 10 countries. Later <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> with individual NATO powers (1959–1983), the Military Training Assistance Plan, which has trained aircrews from developing countries since 1964 and NATO Flying Training in Canada (NFTC), since 1998, a partnership of the Canadian Forces, Bombardier Aerospace Corporation and participating air forces. In 2005, the Canadian Department of National Defence awarded a 22-year, $1.77-billion contract to an Allied Wings team led by Kelowna Flightcraft Ltd. of Kelowna, British Columbia, to provide flying training and support services to the Canadian Forces and international allies. These services are provided out of the Canada Wings Aviation Training Centre in the Southport Aerospace Centre near Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{based on}} {{experience}} of the inter-war years, U.S. planners developed a concept of economic security—that a liberal international economic system would enhance the possibilities of postwar peace. One of those who saw such a security link was Cordell Hull, the United States Secretary of State from 1933 to 1944. Hull believed that the fundamental causes of {{the two world wars}} lay in economic discrimination and trade warfare. Specifically, he had in mind the trade and exchange controls (<b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements)</b> of Nazi Germany and the imperial preference system practiced by Britain, by which members or former members of the British Empire were accorded special trade status, itself provoked by German, French, and American protectionist policies.

2500|$|Caledonian re-applied to the ATLB for a licence {{to launch}} transatlantic {{scheduled}} services from Gatwick, Heathrow or Stansted via Prestwick to New York JFK, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Toronto, and from Birmingham via Prestwick to New York, in 1967. These services {{were to be}} gradually introduced between 1969/70 and 1970/71 utilising the new 707s. BUA, British Eagle and Transglobe Airways simultaneously applied for similar licences. Caledonian objected to the other independent airlines' applications. BOAC opposed all the independents' applications. The Board of Trade (BOT) directed the ATLB to prejudge the four contenders' applications in order to concentrate only on those that stood a reasonable chance of success under existing <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> before the route licensing hearings could begin. As a result, BUA withdrew its own applications but objected to Caledonian's and British Eagle's. Transglobe withdrew its applications as well. Caledonian and British Eagle objected to each other's applications. The ATLB heard Caledonian's applications, British Eagle's counter applications [...] and BOAC's objections in early 1968. Following {{the conclusion of the}} transatlantic scheduled licensing hearings in mid-1968, the ATLB rejected Caledonian's and British Eagle's applications. It felt that the independents generally lacked the financial strength to acquire the then latest widebodied and supersonic transport (SST) aircraft for their proposed services, and that these airlines had insufficient economies of scale to enable them to compete with BOAC and the American carriers on a level playing field. It also felt that it would take the independents too long to make these services profitable. In Caledonian's case, the ATLB found that despite having a dedicated North American sales force and its own ground handling operation at John F. Kennedy Airport, the airline's lack of any kind of scheduled service experience and its almost total reliance on Sabena's and Aviation Traders' engineering support counted against granting it a scheduled service licence {{for one of the most}} competitive air markets in the world. Secondary factors for the ATLB's rejection of Caledonian's applications included the delay in the introduction of Concorde and the non-availability within the envisaged timeframe of widebodied aircraft that were smaller and carried a lower price tag than the Boeing 747, which would have made them better suited to the type of operation proposed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} the bilateral clearing agreement following the separation of Czechoslovakia. The value of the Czech and Slovak Clearing Agreement (CSCA) depended on its ability to relieve pressure on convertible currency reserves and preserve inter-republic trade. The assessment is made by measuring the trend in the Czech and Slovak cases and comparing these results to instances without a <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The CSCA experience reveals that a more widespread use of <b>bilateral</b> clearing <b>arrangements</b> by other transition economies might have provided little in terms of stability to convertible currency reserves. However, the evidence indicates a more positive effect on inter-republic trade than that attained under a number of non-bilateral scenarios. ...|$|R

50|$|Furthermore, these {{challenges}} presented by U.S {{could be explained}} more with the strong belief on bilateral alliances as instruments of control.

But great powers can amplify their capabilities to control small powers and maximize their leverage by forging a series of <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> with allies, rather than see that leverage diluted in a multilateral forum. Arguably, the George W. Bush administration favored intense bilateralism over multilateralism, or even unilateralism, for similar reasons. Rather than going it alone or going it with others, the administration opted for intensive one-on-one relationships with handpicked countries that maximized the U.S. capacity to achieve its objectives.|$|E
