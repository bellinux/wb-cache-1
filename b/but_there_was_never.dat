25|$|When {{the colony}} of New South Wales {{was founded in}} 1788, it ran into the problem {{of a lack of}} coinage. Foreign coins – {{including}} British, Dutch, Indian and Portuguese – were common in its early years, but much of this coin left the colony by way of trade with visiting merchant ships. Barter was a necessity amongst the colonists, with the most popular, rum becoming an unofficial currency. One of the first attempts to restrict the practice was by Governor King, who on 19 November 1800 set an arbitrary price for foreign coinage, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> enough of it. To try and resolve the shortage, he requested the supply of sixpences to be used as shillings, but failed to get a hearing. The practice of using rum as a currency was prohibited by Governor Bligh in 1806, eventually culminating in the overthrow of the government in the Rum Rebellion.|$|E
25|$|Case Study: The {{child of}} an incarcerated father and heroin-addicted, prostitute mother, {{was found on}} July 10, 2000 {{in the home of}} a 20-year-old woman in Germany. Social workers had visited the house at the urging of neighbors, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> {{evidence}} found that neglect was occurring. An autopsy showed no signs of previous fractures, illness or drugs, but the child was malnourished. The Muscina stabulans (False Stable Fly) and Fannia canicularis (Little House fly) were recovered from the genital area of the corpse. These particular flies are attracted to urine and/or feces much more than corpses. With the aid of this evidence and the third fly species recovered from the body, Calliphora vomitoria (Bluebottle Fly), the forensic entomologists could not only estimate the time of death, but prove that the child would have lived if proper legal action had been pursued against the negligent caregiver. The mother received a five-year prison sentence and two social workers were charged for duty of care violation.|$|E
25|$|On October 29, 1945 at 7 p.m., 9-year-old Joseph Vitolo (March 25, 1936 – December 17, 2014) {{was one of}} a {{group of}} {{children}} playing outside his home near The Bronx's Grand Concourse. The children saw something floating above a hill behind the house, and when Joseph recited a Hail Mary he immediately saw a young woman whom he identified as the Virgin. He heard her ask him to come back at the same hour for sixteen nights and to pray for world peace. Joseph did so, accompanied by his mother and numerous onlookers. Within a few days, the visitations were receiving worldwide attention and up to 20,000 people attended the nightly vigil. Among those who flocked to the Vitolo residence were Frank Sinatra and Cardinal Francis Spellman. Revered as a saint by the pilgrims, Joseph was frequently asked to cure the sick and injured and would respond by praying with them. The place where Joseph saw the visions was bought by a devotee who created a shrine there, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> any official investigation or attempt to confirm the reported visitations as legitimate. Joseph struggled throughout his life, taking various menial jobs to support his family. He continued to visit the shrine at 7 p.m. each evening until age and poor health prevented him from climbing the hill. The apparitions were never officially approved, but the nearby St. Philip Neri church holds special Masses at the shrine on the anniversaries of the first and last reported visitations.|$|E

500|$|Once activated, the {{division}} {{remained in the}} United States for training and exercises. As {{the division}}, like all airborne units, {{was intended to be}} an elite formation, the training regime was extremely arduous. There were [...] and [...] towers built from which prospective airborne troops would jump off of to simulate landing by parachute, lengthy forced marches and practice jumps from transport aircraft; to pause in the doorway of an aircraft during a practice jump resulted in an automatic failure for the candidate. The resultant failure rate was accordingly high, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> a shortage of candidates, especially for the American divisions, as the rate of pay was much higher than that of an ordinary infantryman. As the division trained, a debate developed in the U.S. Army over whether the best use of airborne forces was en masse or as small compact units. On 9 July 1943, the first large-scale Allied airborne operation–the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky)–was carried out by elements of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and the British 1st Airborne Division. The Commanding General (CG) of the U.S. 11th Airborne Division, Major General Joseph May Swing, had been temporarily assigned to act as airborne advisor to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, for the invasion of Sicily, and had observed the airborne assault, which went badly. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division had been deployed by both parachute and glider and had suffered high casualties, leading to a perception that it had failed to achieve many of its objectives.|$|E
