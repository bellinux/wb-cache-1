5|$|Manganese is {{essential}} to {{iron and steel production}} <b>by</b> <b>virtue</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel.|$|E

40|$|To {{ensure the}} {{installation}} of the new design of protective armor structure on larger warships,a study into the installation process of the structure of this armor is carried out to improve installation efficiency and ensure the protective effect. This paper proposes a typical composite armor structure design which is composed of ‘silicate aerogel/ballistic ceramic/high-strength polyethylene/silicate aerogel’. The study analyzes the modeling design,down-selection of materials and equipment,and real ship mock-up technical development. The reliability and application of high strength polyethylene in response to high temperatures in the real ship installation process is discussed. The results show that high-temperatures during welding have no negative impact on the high strength polyethylene of the armored structure. The design demonstrates that this installation process is feasible and can be provided as an alternative solution <b>by</b> <b>virtues</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> good maneuverability,controllable precision,checkable quality and high reliability...|$|R

Though Fort Greble was built on a hill, the area immediately surrounding the fort consisted of swampy bottomland drained by the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, {{a breeding ground for}} malaria. Communication with the outside world was provided by the military road that served the Eastern Branch line of forts, and supply wagons would usually arrive on a weekly schedule.

5|$|During the Cold War Era, the {{relationships}} between the First World, Second World and the Third World were very rigid. The First World and Second World were at constant odds with one another via the tensions between their two cores, the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively. The Cold War, <b>by</b> <b>virtue</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> name, was a primarily ideological struggle between the First and Second Worlds, or more specifically, the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Multiple doctrines and plans dominated Cold War dynamics including the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan (from the U.S) and the Molotov Plan (from the Soviet Union). The extent of the odds between the two worlds is evident in Berlin—which was then split into East and West. To stop citizens in East Berlin from having too much exposure to the capitalist West, the Soviet Union put up the Berlin Wall within the actual city.|$|E

From the 1970s, planetary scientists and astrobiologists began to consider various other factors required for the creation and sustenance of life, including the impact that a nearby supernova may have on life's development. In 1981, Jim Clarke proposed that the apparent lack of extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way {{could be explained by}} Seyfert-type outbursts from an active galactic nucleus, with Earth alone being spared from this radiation <b>by</b> <b>virtue</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> location in the galaxy.

40|$|Aim of the study: Wu-Zi-Yan-Zong-Wan (WZ) is a {{traditional}} Chinese herbal formula which is commonly used for treating patients with "Yang deficiency". In the present study, the effect of WZ on ethanol-induced toxicity in CYP 2 E 1 cDNA-transfected HepG 2 (E 47) cells was investigated. Materials and Methods: WZ extract was obtained by extracting the herbal powder with 50 % ethanol (v/v, in water) {{and the effect of}} the extract on ethanol-induced toxicity was investigated in cultured cells. Results: The treatment with WZ extract (12. 5 - 200 mu g/mL) for 24 h dose-dependently protected against ethanol-induced toxicity in E 47 cells, as evidenced by the enhanced cell viability and decreased extent of lactate dehydrogeanse leakage. The cytoprotection against ethanol-induced toxicity was associated with decreases in the extents of reactive oxygen species production and lipid peroxidation, as well as increases in mitochondrial reduced glutathione and membrane potential. In addition, WZ extract treatment also suppressed the formation of DNA fragments in ethanol-intoxicated E 47 cells. Conclusions: WZ extract was found to protect against the ethanol-induced toxicity in E 47 cells, possibly <b>by</b> <b>virtues</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> antioxidant activity.

The Gator Bowl, which is also held in Jacksonville, was reluctant to choose a team that {{had participated in the}} ACC Championship Game out of feat that the team's fans would be unwilling to return to Jacksonville so quickly.
