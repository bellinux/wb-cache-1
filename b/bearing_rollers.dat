50|$|A bearing {{supported}} gear in {{a manual}} transmission rotates synchronously with its shaft {{due to the}} dog-gear engagement. In this case, the small diametrical clearance in the bearing will induce precession of the roller group relative to the gear mitigating any fretting that occurs if the same <b>bearing</b> <b>rollers</b> always push against the same spot on the gear. Typically the 4th and 5th gears will have precession inducing features, while 1st through 3rd gears might not since cars spend less time in those gears. Transmission failure {{due to lack of}} precession is possible in gear boxes when low gears are engaged for long periods of time.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{refers to}} study of hydrodynamic behavior of large bearings equipped with automatic lubrication system, where the liquid used {{may have a}} viscosity with variable values depending on the temperature or depending on the additive used. The introduction of additives with nanoparticles causes modification of viscosity and a significant reduction of friction coefficient. This study establishes a direct link between the friction, viscosity and tensions {{that occur in the}} contact area. Experimental studies confirm improving tribological properties of the contact area between the <b>bearing</b> <b>rollers</b> and raceways, through attracting nanoparticles on surfaces in contact and reducing friction coefficient. Accomplished finite element analysis showed decrease of the contact stresses, therefore decrease of the wear and increase the life of the bearing.

40|$|Measurement {{techniques}} {{are applied to}} tribocomponents at three size scales. Device-level parameters are assessed in a displacement-controlled axial bearing test rig. Component-level testing is performed using a miniature radio telemeter embedded in a bearing roller. Contact pressure and temperature are measured with thin-film contact sensors fabricated on steel and glass disks and loaded in an optical EHL (elastohydrodynamic lubrication) test system. ^ Low crosstalk bearing torque measurements were made with a compliant fixed shaft and two RF (radio frequency) proximity sensors. Use of single components for multiple functions permitted the fabrication of a 5 by 9 by 1. 5 millimeter sensor/telemeter weighing 80 milligrams. Data was transmitted using thermal frequency modulation of oscillator tank capacitance. Telemeter output sensitivity of the thermal frequency modulation technique at temperatures above 40 °C was 15 KHz/MHz-°C. A comparative analysis of signal conditioner bandwidth, spatial averaging and capacitive coupling facilitates determination of the speed-limiting aspect of a thin-film contact sensor. Techniques for photolithographic patterning of zirconium, a material exhibiting a low pressure coefficient of resistance, have been developed. ^ Load increments up to 10 % associated with component heating and with oil film development in tapered roller bearing contacts were measured using the axial bearing tester. Rapid thermal response to loss of lubricant of instrumented <b>bearing</b> <b>rollers</b> indicates great potential of the technology in condition monitoring. Pressure distributions measured in grease-lubricated contacts loaded to peak Hertz stress levels of 0. 78 to 0. 87 GPa were indicative of the base oils, with no thickener-induced broadening observed. ...|$|E

50|$|Tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> use conical <b>rollers</b> {{that run}} on conical races. Most <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> only take radial or axial loads, but tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> support both radial and axial loads, and {{generally}} can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. Tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the tapered roller is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the <b>roller</b> in the <b>bearing</b> adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|R
50|$|Spherical <b>roller</b> thrust <b>bearings</b> use {{asymmetrical}} <b>rollers</b> of spherical shape, rolling {{inside a}} house washer with a raceway with spherical inner shape.

50|$|CARB <b>bearings</b> are {{toroidal}} <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> {{and similar}} to spherical <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> but can accommodate both angular misalignment and also axial displacement. Compared to a spherical <b>roller</b> <b>bearing,</b> their {{radius of curvature}} is longer than a spherical radius would be, making them an intermediate form between spherical and cylindrical rollers. Their limitation is that, like a cylindrical roller, they do not locate axially. CARB bearings are typically used in pairs with a locating bearing, such as a spherical <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> This non-locating bearing can be an advantage, {{as it can be}} used to allow a shaft and a housing to undergo thermal expansion independently.|$|R
