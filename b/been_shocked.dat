5|$|When approached, {{the coffin}} ray tends to keep {{still in its}} place of {{concealment}} on the sea floor. As a result, many divers, swimmers, and bathers have <b>been</b> <b>shocked</b> after accidentally contacting it. While not life-threatening, the shock can be quite severe. The shock can still be perceived by a person pouring a stream of seawater on the ray. The coffin ray has no economic value. In 1883, Edward Pierson Ramsay noted {{that it was the}} only ray native to Port Jackson that was inedible. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawlers, but is hardy enough to usually be returned to the water alive. It is also caught in lobster traps and infrequently taken by spear fishers. As it remains common and widespread, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Least Concern. It has been kept in public aquariums, but requires moving food.|$|E

Professor Ezergailis noted however, that before returning to Germany, and despite his claim to have <b>been</b> <b>shocked</b> by the July 8–10 massacres, Grauel went on from Liepāja to the nearby town of Ventspils, where he organized additional killings.|$|E

25|$|Japan's {{entry into}} World War II {{and the war}} in the Pacific {{commenced}} with the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which was coordinated with closely coinciding attacks on Thailand, the Philippines, the American bases on Guam and Wake Island, and the British possessions of Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Japanese forces rapidly secured territory in South-East Asia, the East Indies, and the Central and South-West Pacific. Australia had <b>been</b> <b>shocked</b> by the speedy collapse of British Malaya and the fall of Singapore. With the fall, nearly 15,000 Australian soldiers became prisoners of war {{along with the rest of}} the garrison of some 85,000 (mostly British and Indian troops).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, Elizabeth Cady Stanton {{travelled}} through Europe gathering support for, and inviting participation in, her work-in-progress The Woman's Bible. One evening, Stanton {{spoke to a}} crowd at Clark's home {{about the state of}} the suffrage movement in America. Local clergymen present questioned Stanton about the Bible's position of woman in relation to man, and Stanton described at length how equality among the sexes was supported by Bible verse, but that the Bible could be selectively quoted to support conflicting arguments. Because of this, said Stanton, it should be limited in its authority. Clark, though sympathetic to Stanton's views, expressed to Stanton her fear that some of the strictest of those in attendance might have <b>been</b> <b>shocked</b> by her ultra-liberal opinions.|$|E
25|$|The French Revolution of 1789 {{probably}} {{added to}} the strain that Charlotte felt. Queen Charlotte and Queen Marie Antoinette of France and Navarre kept a close relationship. Charlotte was 11 years older than Marie Antoinette, yet they shared many interests, such as their love of music and the arts, in which they both enthusiastically took an interest. Never meeting face to face, they kept their friendship to pen and paper. Marie Antoinette confided in Charlotte upon {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolution. Charlotte had organized apartments to be prepared and ready for the refugee royal family of France to occupy. After the execution of Marie Antoinette and the bloody events that followed, Charlotte was said to have <b>been</b> <b>shocked</b> and overwhelmed that such a thing could happen to a kingdom, and at Britain's doorstep.|$|E

25|$|Iorga's {{changing}} sentiment flowed {{between the}} extremes of Francophilia and Francophobia. The Romanian scholar explained in detail his dislike for the Third Republic's social and political landscape. He recalled that, in the 1890s, he had <b>been</b> <b>shocked</b> by the irreverence and cosmopolitanism of French student society. In a 1906 speech, Iorga also noted that Francophone elites and urban diglossia were slowly destroying the country's social fiber, by creating a language gap between classes. Also, Neamul Românesc showed a preference for Action Française and the French reactionary right in their conflict with the Third Republic. Shortly after the beginning of World War I, during the Battle of the Frontiers, Iorga publicized his renewed love for France, claiming {{that she was the}} only belligerent engaged in a purely defensive war; in the name of Pan-Latinism, he later chided Spain for keeping neutral.|$|E
500|$|Many {{resistance}} {{people in}} Norway had <b>been</b> <b>shocked</b> {{when they found}} out that Andersen had been allowed to serve in NOR.I.C.1. Leading saboteur Max Manus wrote shortly after the war in his book Det vil helst gå godt: [...] "It was one hell of a risk to send a man with Gulosten's reputation and history out on secret military missions. It would have been a great embarrassment if Fritt Folk had been able to publish that Gulosten made a career in King Håkon's armed forces". Andersen protested against Manus' account when it was published.|$|E
500|$|The bloody {{standoff}} at Antietam in September 1862 {{that ended}} Lee's first major incursion into the North, gave Lincoln the confidence in Union arms {{he needed to}} announce the Emancipation Proclamation. British newspapers mocked Lincoln for hypocrisy in freeing slaves only in Confederate-held areas, where he could exercise no authority. British officials had <b>been</b> <b>shocked</b> by the outcome of Antietam—they had expected Lee to deliver another brilliant victory—and now considered an additional reason for intervening in the conflict. [...] Antietam, the bloodiest day of the war, had been a stalemate; they read this as presaging an overall deadlock in the war, with North and South at each other's throats for years as Britain's mills sat empty and its people starved. France agreed with this assessment.|$|E
