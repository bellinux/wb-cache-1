40|$|Summary: It {{has been}} shown that <b>benzethonium</b> {{chloride}} produces linear mixed-type inhibition of choline esterase and acetylcholine esterase. These enzymes also show-reagent-carry-over inhibition if the enzyme activities are measured in plastic cuvettes in which previously protein has been determined by the alkaline <b>benzethonium</b> chloride method. Choline esterase is about 10 -fold more sensitive to <b>benzethonium</b> chloride than acetylcholine esterase. With acetylthiocholine as substrate Michaelis-Menten constants for choline esterase and acetylcholine esterase are 85 μηιοΙ/ 1 and 102 μηιοΙ/ 1, respectively.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Ketamine {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to be neurotoxic in animals {{as well as in}} patients. Preservatives added to ketamine have been accused to induce this neurotoxicity. Therefore, we investigated whether the most widely used preservative of ketamine-benzethonium chloride-enhances the toxicity of S(+) -ketamine in vitro in lymphoma, neuroblastoma cells and primary astrocytes. METHODS: Human Jurkat T-lymphoma- and neuroblastoma cells (SHEP) were incubated for 24 hours with commercially available S-ketamine containing <b>benzethonium,</b> pure S-ketamine and pure <b>benzethonium</b> chloride. The rate of early- and late-apoptotic cells was evaluated by flowcytometry. In a second step the combined toxicity of <b>benzethonium</b> and ketamine was investigated in neuroblastoma cells and primary rat astrocytes in a mitochondrial activity assay (XTT). The additivity of the toxicities was evaluated by employing isobolographic analysis. RESULTS: In Jurkat T-lymphoma and neuroblastoma cells <b>benzethonium</b> increased the toxicity of ketamine from 32 % to 80 % and from 64 % to 84 % cell deaths, respectively. In neuroblastoma cells as well as in primary rat astrocytes the measured combined toxicity was within the confidence interval of the calculated pure additive toxicity as seen in the isobolograms. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that <b>benzethonium</b> increases the local toxicity of ketamine in cells of hematopoetic, neuronal and glial origin in an additive manner.

40|$|Objectives: Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is {{responsible}} for {{an increasing number of}} skin infections.

The current study utilized a modified time–kill design to evaluate the activity of three over-the-counter topical wound care products (<b>benzethonium</b> chloride/essential oils, neomycin/polymyxin B and polymyxin B/gramicidin) against four unique isolates (three USA 300 and one USA 400). Methods: All experiments were performed using commercially available formulations. Bactericidal activity was defined as a sustained 3 log 10 reduction in cfu/mL from the initial inoculum. Reductions in bacterial counts between agents were determined using analysis of variance. Results: At 10 min, the reduction (mean+SD) in log 10 cfu/mL for all strains was 2. 87 + 1. 22, 1. 86 + 0. 76 and 0. 143 + 0. 82 for <b>benzethonium</b> chloride/essential oils, neomycin/polymyxin B and polymyxin B/gramicidin, respectively.

40|$|Oomycetes in {{the genus}} Phytophthora {{are among the}} most {{damaging}} plant pathogens worldwide. Two important species are Phytophthora cinnamomi, which causes root rot in thousands of native and agricultural plants, and Phytophthora agathidicida, which causes kauri dieback disease in New Zealand. As is the case for other Phytophthora species, management options for these two pathogens are limited. Here, we have screened over 100 compounds for their anti-oomycete activity, as a potential first step toward identifying new control strategies. Our screening identified eight compounds that showed activity against both Phytophthora species. These included five antibiotics, two copper compounds and a quaternary ammonium cation. These compounds were tested for their inhibitory action against three stages of the Phytophthora life cycle: mycelial growth, zoospore germination, and zoospore motility. The inhibitory effects of the compounds were broadly similar between the two Phytophthora species, but their effectiveness varied widely among life cycle stages. Mycelial growth was most successfully inhibited by the antibiotics chlortetracycline and paromomycin, and the quaternary ammonium salt <b>benzethonium</b> chloride.
