We recently identified a glucose response {{element in the}} immediate upstream non-coding region of the rat glucagon receptor gene. We previously showed that this DNA element is centered on a palindromic sequence of 19 nucleotides (termed as <b>G</b> <b>box),</b> containing two E boxes separated by three nucleotides. In the present study, we further characterized the DNA sequence requirements for the glucose induced expression of the rat glucagon receptor gene. Transfection study realized in the insulin-producing INS- 1 cells revealed that a fragment of 49 nucleotides, centered on the <b>G</b> <b>box,</b> bears all the features required for the glucose activation. Mutations performed in the 5 ′-E box totally abolished the glucose responsiveness, whereas mutations or deletion of the 3 ′-E box only had a limited effect. Deletions performed upstream from the <b>G</b> <b>box</b> revealed that an accessory factor binding site, located in the region just upstream from the <b>G</b> <b>box,</b> is required for full stimulation by glucose. Finally, by using <b>G</b> <b>box</b> based probes in gel shift experiments, we demonstrated that USF 1 /USF 2 transcription factors {{are part of the}} proteinic complex that binds to the glucose response element of the rat glucagon receptor gene promoter. In conclusion, in contrast to many other glucose regulated genes, only the 5 ′-E box appears to be a crucial DNA element for the glucose transcriptional effect.

We show that JFC 1 specifically binds to the ATP analog 8 -azido-[α- 32 P]ATP. The affinity of JFC 1 for [α- 32 P]ATP was 10 × greater than its affinity for [α- 32 P]ADP; the protein {{did not appear to}} bind to [α- 32 P]GTP. JFC 1 hydrolyzed [α- 32 P]ATP in a Mg 2 +-dependent manner. JFC 1, which also hydrolyzed dATP, has a relatively high affinity for ATP, with a KM value of 58 μM, and a kcat value of 2. 27 per min.

In an effort to learn more about how plants use this vital nutrient, two projects using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana were undertaken. The first was a novel genetic screen using transgenic plants harboring the reporter Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) driven by the iron-regulated AtFer 1 promoter. One mutant, OAF 102, was identified for its constitutively high GFP fluorescence relative to unmutagenized transgenic controls. OAF 102 has constitutively elevated GFP mRNA but retains iron-dependent expression of AtFer 1; all other iron-related traits tested were similar in OAF 102 and the transgenic parent. Sequencing of the transgenic promoter from OAF 102 did not reveal any mutations in the TATA <b>box,</b> <b>G</b> <b>Box,</b> or iron-dependent regulatory sequence (IDRS). The decoupled regulation of these genes may indicate an epigenetic mutation or a mutation elsewhere in the genome. The other project is an investigation of mutant lines singly and doubly mutant for T-DNA insertions in four bHLH transcription factors found to be upregulated during iron deficiency. Neither single nor double mutant lines showed alterations in ferric-chelate reductase activity. This may reflect a role in iron homeostasis that is not detectable using this tool or a degree of functional redundancy. Further investigation of these T-DNA lines and of OAF 102 is ongoing.

40|$|Advance online {{publication}} 27 June 2012 The Forkhead <b>box</b> <b>G</b> 1 (FOXG 1) gene {{has been}} implicated in severe Rett-like phenotypes. It encodes the Forkhead <b>box</b> protein <b>G</b> 1, a winged-helix transcriptional repressor critical for forebrain development. Recently, the core FOXG 1 syndrome was defined as postnatal microcephaly, severe mental retardation, absent language, dyskinesia, and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. We present seven additional patients with a severe Rett-like neurodevelopment disorder associated with de novo FOXG 1 point mutations (two cases) or 14 q 12 deletions (five cases). We expand the mutational spectrum in patients with FOXG 1 -related encephalopathies and precise the core FOXG 1 syndrome phenotype. Dysgenesis of the corpus callosum and dyskinesia are not always present in FOXG 1 -mutated patients. We believe that the FOXG 1 gene {{should be considered in}} severely mentally retarded patients (no speech-language) with severe acquired microcephaly (− 4 to− 6 [*]SD) and few clinical features suggestive of Rett syndrome. Interestingly enough, three 14 q 12 deletions that do not include the FOXG 1 gene are associated with phenotypes very reminiscent to that of FOXG 1 -mutation-positive patients. We physically mapped a putative long-range FOXG 1 -regulatory element in a 0. 43 [*]Mb DNA segment encompassing the PRKD 1 locus. In fibroblast cells, a cis-acting regulatory sequence located more than 0. 6 [*]Mb away from FOXG 1 acts as a silencer at the transcriptional level. These data are important for clinicians and for molecular biologists involved in the management of patients with severe encephalopathies compatible with a FOXG 1 -related phenotype.

However, not all the actors perform every action, {{and the number of}} instances of each action can vary largely.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question, first {{raised by}} Langlands, {{is to know}} whether the Rankin-Selberg product of two (not necessarily holomorphic) cusp forms f and g is modular, i. e., if there exists an automorphic form f <b>box</b> <b>g</b> on GL(4) /Q whose standard L-function equals L^*(s, f x g) after removing the ramified and archimedean factors. The first main result {{of this paper is to}} answer it in the affirmative, in fact with the base field Q replaced by any number field F. Our proof uses a mixture of converse theorems, base change and descent, and it also appeals to the local regularity properties of Eisenstein series and the scalar products of their truncations. One of the applications of this result is that the space of cusp forms on SL(2) has multiplicity one. Concretely this means the following: If f, g are newforms of holomorphic or Maass type with trivial character such that the squares of the p-th coeficients of f and g are the same at almost all primes p, then g must be a twist of f by a quadratic Dirichlet character.

In this work we reisolated the rpo 21 - 24 /rpb 1 -E 1230 K allele, which reduces the interaction of RNAPII–TFIIS, and identified five new point mutations in RPB 1 that cause hypersensitivity to 6 AU.
