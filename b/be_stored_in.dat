5|$|Machines that {{generated}} static electricity {{with a glass}} disc were popular and widespread in Europe by 1740. In 1745, German cleric Ewald Georg von Kleist and Dutch scientist Pieter van Musschenbroek discovered independently that the electric charge from these machines could <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a Leyden jar, named after the city of Leiden in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Some site opponents assert that, {{after the}} {{predicted}} containment {{failure of the}} waste containers, these cracks may provide a route for movement of radioactive waste that dissolves in the water flowing downward from the desert surface. Officials state that the waste containers will <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> {{such a way as}} to minimize or even nearly eliminate this possibility.|$|E
5|$|A $1 million {{insurance}} policy was secured against the diamond with Lloyd's of London. The terms set by Lloyd's stipulated {{that it could}} only be publicly worn for thirty days in any given year, that it <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a vault, and that Taylor was to be accompanied by armed guards when wearing it in public. Taylor would later have a replica made of the diamond that cost $2,800.|$|E

5000|$|Storage Method: Describes {{the form}} <b>in</b> which files <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the repository. A {{snapshot}} {{indicates that a}} committed file(s) <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> its entirety—usually compressed. A changeset, in this context, indicates that a committed file(s) <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of a}} difference between either the previous version or the next.|$|R
5000|$|Data <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a vEB tree as follows: The {{smallest}} value currently <b>in</b> {{the tree}} <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> [...] and largest value <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> [...] Note that [...] <b>is</b> not <b>stored</b> anywhere else <b>in</b> the vEB tree, while [...] is.

5|$|Elemental gallium is {{not found}} in nature, but it is easily {{obtained}} by smelting. Very pure gallium metal has a silvery color and its solid metal fractures conchoidally like glass. Gallium liquid expands by 3.1% when it solidifies; therefore, it should not <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> glass or metal containers because the container may rupture when the gallium changes state. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with {{a short list of}} other materials that includes water, silicon, germanium, antimony, bismuth, and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen-year-old Andy {{is about}} to leave for college, and his toys have not been played with for years. He intends to take Woody with him, and puts Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, and the other toys in a trash bag to <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the attic. Andy's mother mistakenly takes the bag to the curb for garbage pickup. The toys escape and, believing Andy {{intended}} to throw them away, decide to climb into a donation box with Molly's discarded toy, Barbie, bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows them, but is unable to convince them of the mistake.|$|E
5|$|Since {{electrical}} energy cannot easily <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> quantities {{large enough to}} meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses.|$|E
5000|$|Versioned file content <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> {{a master}} {{directory}} hierarchy whose top levels are called [...] "depots".Text file revisions <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> as RCS deltas, and binary file revisions <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> their entirety.|$|R
50|$|The {{specific}} name hemmeni is {{in honor of}} malacologist Jens Hemmen (1944-2012). Holotype <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> Hungarian Natural History Museum, paratypes <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> collections of András Hunyadi and Barna Páll-Gergely.|$|R
5000|$|The {{waveform}} amplitude values <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> {{a buffer}} memory, which <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a phase generator. When addressed, the retrieved value {{is used as}} the basis of the synthesized sound.|$|R
5|$|Some of the {{radioactive}} waste at Hanford {{was supposed to}} <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the planned Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, but after that project was suspended, Washington State sued, joined by South Carolina. Their first suit was dismissed in July 2011. In a subsequent suit, federal authorities were ordered to either approve or reject plans for the Yucca Mountain storage site.|$|E
5|$|The {{new sound}} chip and MIDI out {{abilities}} {{were exposed to}} the BASIC programming language with the command PLAY and a new command SPECTRUM was added to switch the machine into 48K mode, keeping the current BASIC program intact (although {{there is no way to}} switch back to 128K mode). To enable BASIC programmers to access the additional memory, a RAM disk was created where files could <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the additional 80KB of RAM. The new commands took the place of two existing user-defined-character spaces causing compatibility problems with certain BASIC programs.|$|E
5|$|All campsites {{accessible}} only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites {{and they are}} available by permit only, but camping is allowed {{in most of these}} backcountry zones year-round. The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set carrying capacity of overnight stays per zone to protect the resources from overcrowding. Open fires are not permitted in the backcountry and all food must <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> an Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee approved bear-resistant container. As of 2012, only four brands of bear-resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand Teton National Park backcountry. Additionally, hikers may use an approved bear spray to elude aggressive bears.|$|E
5000|$|Tank rounds <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> {{individual}} fire-proof canisters, which {{reduce the}} chance of cookoffs in a fire inside the tank. The turret is [...] "dry"; no active rounds <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> it.|$|R

5|$|Although DuMont's {{programming}} pre-dated videotape, many DuMont offerings {{were recorded}} on kinescopes. These kinescopes {{were said to}} <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a warehouse until the 1970s. Actress Edie Adams, the wife of comedian Ernie Kovacs (both regular performers on early television) testified in 1996 before a panel of the Library of Congress on the preservation of television and video. Adams claimed that so little value was given to these films that the stored kinescopes were loaded into three trucks and dumped into Upper New York Bay. Nevertheless, a number of DuMont programs survive at The Paley Center for Media in New York City, the UCLA Film and Television Archive in Los Angeles, in the Peabody Awards Collection at the University of Georgia, and the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|British law {{requires}} that temazepam (but not midazolam) <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> safe custody. Safe custody requirements ensures that pharmacists and doctors holding stock of temazepam must store it in securely fixed double-locked steel safety cabinets and maintain a written register, which must be bound and contain separate entries for temazepam and must be written in ink with no use of correction fluid (although a written register is not required for temazepam in the United Kingdom). Disposal of expired stock must be witnessed by a designated inspector (either a local drug-enforcement police officer or official from health authority). Benzodiazepine abuse ranges from occasional binges on large doses, to chronic and compulsive drug abuse of high doses.|$|E
5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually {{stored in a}} hydrocarbon sealant, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals can <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, {{the result of a}} secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E
5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E
5|$|Routine care {{during the}} growing season {{involves}} keeping the rows free of competing weeds, especially when the plants are young. The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need a great deal of water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left {{on the surface of the}} soil for a few days to dry out properly, then they can be placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a well-ventilated, cool place such as a shed.|$|E

5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these can <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division {{by the use of}} 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and easy to handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company. (Svensk Kärnbränslehantering AB, {{known as}} SKB) {{was created in}} 1980 and is {{responsible}} for final disposal of nuclear waste there. This includes operation of a monitored retrievable storage facility, the Central Interim Storage Facility for Spent Nuclear Fuel at Oskarshamn, about 150 miles south of Stockholm on the Baltic coast; transportation of spent fuel; and construction of a permanent repository. Swedish utilities store spent fuel at the reactor site for one year before transporting it to the facility at Oskarshamn, where it will <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> excavated caverns filled with water for about 30 years before removal to a permanent repository.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. was {{expanding}} westwards and, in Ohio, Hiram Joy {{began to}} exploit Crystal Lake, near Chicago, which was soon {{linked to the}} city by the Chicago, St Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad company. The ice was used to allow goods {{to be brought to}} market. Cincinnati and Chicago began to use ice to help the packing of pork in the summer, John L. Schooley developing the first refrigerated packing room. Fruit began to <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the central Illinois using refrigerators, for consumption in later seasons. By the 1860s, ice was being used to allow the brewing of the increasingly popular lager beer all year round. Improved railroad links helped the growth in business across the region and to the east.|$|E
