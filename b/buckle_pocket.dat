60|$|The {{inhabitants}} flocked around me, examining my clothing, and exclaiming in wonderment at {{each new}} discovery of button, <b>buckle,</b> <b>pocket,</b> and flap. It seemed incredible {{that such a}} thing could be, almost within a stone's throw of the spot where but a brief two centuries before had stood the greatest city of the world.|$|E

5000|$|In March 2013, Kuentai, a Japanese nonprofit {{organization}} that searches for bodies of Japanese soldiers found his remains under more than 3 ft of clay along with the remains of four other American soldiers. The group also found his dog tags, belt <b>buckle,</b> poncho, a <b>pocket</b> watch, loose change, and his 1939 class ring. [...] Even though these artifacts were found with the remains, the United States Army did not declare them as Carneal's until DNA testing confirmed his identity on December 4, 2013. DNA testing was done {{using one of the}} letters Carneal had sealed that his family had.|$|R
40|$|A {{composite}} grid-stiffened cylindrically curved {{panel was}} fabricated and tested in static compression. Joint tension test coupons were fabricated from an unused {{portion of the}} panel construction and tested to failure in direct tension (rib/skin pull-off). Pre- and posttest analyses were performed to assess initial and overall buckling response. Comparisons to test data were made to assess: a) the influence of skin <b>pocket</b> <b>buckling</b> on overall structure response, b) the predictability of overall structure response through the range of operational load application, and c) probable causes of failure in this test panel and in future tests with rib and skin configuration optimized for specific spacecraft fairing applications...|$|R
50|$|Rodney, {{known as}} the country boy, is a gentle giant and muscular farm-boy with a huge heart and rosy cheeks. He's very shy, quiet, cute, sweet and handsome, and is usually seen blushing. He also doesn't talk very much. In fact he {{falls in love with}} a new girl in every episode, having fallen for Jasmine, Scarlett, and Amy, but never really admitting whom he likes a lot more than the other. He has fair skin, freckles, orange hair, and a large cleft chin. He wears navy blue ankle-length {{overalls}} with yellow <b>buckles,</b> a stomach <b>pocket,</b> side pockets, and light blue bottom edges over a white shirt with grey streaks covering his neck and red and white sneakers. He is also a close reference to Wreck-It Ralph and Johnny Cash. Voiced by Ian Ronningen.|$|R
