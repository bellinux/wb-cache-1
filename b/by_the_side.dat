5|$|After {{capturing}} the crater, Cherry pushed {{on through the}} village, where his party emerged from among the buildings on the far side. Another stiff fight ensured {{with a group of}} Germans in dug-outs <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the road, before the company was able to meet up with its fellow units which had bypassed the village and were already established to the north and east of the area. Cherry's orders were to fall back into reserve, but he disregarded them as he sensed a counter-attack was forthcoming. At 09:00 on 27 March, the Germans launched a very strong counter-attack under heavy artillery fire. At one point, Cherry noticed that the Germans were firing yellow flares to pinpoint Australian positions to their gunners. He found some of these flares, and fired them away from his position. The German attempts to retake Lagnicourt—at a cost to the 7th Brigade of 377 casualties—raged all day before they abandoned the counterattack.|$|E

5|$|Headley states {{he gained}} {{approval}} to sell old Scientology materials on eBay to recoup {{money for the}} organization – he was later accused of embezzlement for doing this. In 2005, when {{he knew he would}} be faced with being sent to the organization's prison-like program the Rehabilitation Project Force, Headley decided to leave. Headley worried that leaving Scientology would mean becoming separated from his wife Claire, to whom he had been married for 13 years, and other family members in accordance with the Scientology practice of disconnection. Headley alleges that left Gold Base on his motorcycle but was followed by Scientology security guards, which resulted in Headley falling off his bike <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the road. Riverside County, California Sheriff's arrived, and they helped Headley safely get further away from the Scientology compound. From there he traveled to his father in Kansas City. He was later reunited with his wife who had also been an employee at Gold Base. Prior to his wife's departure from Gold Base, she was monitored closely day and night by the organization.|$|E
5|$|Jump {{distance}} is measured {{from the edge}} of the table to the placement of landing by increments of 0.5m. This is done using electronic and video monitoring systems together with event personnel assigned to observe jumps <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the hill, known as 'distance measurers'. If enough jumps are deemed to be too far beyond the hill size, or near the 'fall line' as determined by the jury – the zone where the slope begins to flatten out – an immediate meeting is held between the jury and race director, which usually results in the start gate being lowered so as to check inrun speeds and therefore distances. For spectators and judges, increments of 5m are clearly indicated by rows of fir across the hill; a painted red line is used for the K-point, and a dashed red line for the hill size. Both sides of the hill are also marked highly visible in red to indicate the 'landing zone', while the point beyond the hill size is marked in green on the sides.|$|E
5|$|Left {{without any}} family, Morales headed for Antofagasta, then a port town in Bolivia that was booming {{due to the}} nitrate mines in the area. She {{travelled}} there as a steerage passenger, with a ticket she bought by selling nearly all of her possessions. While working there, she met Santiago Pizarro, a Chilean in his 30s who made his living in a Bolivian military band, and married him in mid-1878, aged 13. He was tried and executed on 21 September of that year for killing a Bolivian soldier in a drunken brawl. She found his body dumped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the railway tracks and took a gold ring from his finger, which she wore {{for the rest of}} her life. Pizarro's execution was widely protested by the mostly Chilean population of Antofagasta, which resented what was seen as an unjust Bolivian government.|$|E

5|$|Mido {{was thrown}} out of the Egypt team during the 2006 African Cup of Nations as a {{consequence}} of an argument with coach Hassan Shehata in the semi-final game against Senegal, which started after Mido reacted badly to being substituted.

A day later, Mido reconciled with Shehata, but was given a six-month suspension from playing with Egypt. Mido was eventually recalled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> following his suspension, ready for the 2008 African Cup of Nations qualification which Egypt won. Mido was included in the Egypt squad to play South Africa in London in November 2006, despite suffering from a knee injury at the time. However, he was left out of the Egypt squad to play Mauritania in an African Nations Cup qualifier in March 2007.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August, the Governor Murray {{constituted}} a general court-martial, {{presided over by}} Lt.-Col. Stephen Arthur Goodman. Despite the initial revolt passing largely peacefully with slave masters locked in their homes, those who were considered ringleaders were tried at set up at different estates along the coast and executed by shooting; their heads were cut off and nailed to posts. A variety of sentences were handed out, including solitary confinement, lashing, and death. Bryant (1824) records 72 slaves having been sentenced by court-martial {{at the time of}} publication. He noted that 19 of the 45 death sentences had been carried out; a further 18 slaves had been reprieved. Quamina was among those executed; their bodies were hung up in chains <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of a public road in front of their respective plantations and left to rot for months afterwards. Jack Gladstone was sold and deported to St Lucia; Da Costa suggests that a letter Sir John had sent on his behalf resulted in clemency.|$|E

5|$|Passing {{from these}} {{historic}} examples {{we find the}} chair monopolized by the ruler, lay or ecclesiastical, to a comparatively late date. As the seat of authority it stood {{at the head of}} the lord’s table, on his dais, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of his bed. The seigneurial chair, more common in France and the Netherlands than in England, is a very interesting type, approximating in many respects to the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a very high back and sometimes had a canopy. Arms were invariable, and the lower part was closed in with panelled or carved front and sides—the seat, indeed, was often hinged and sometimes closed with a key.|$|E
5|$|The heat is made {{tangible}} by the flustered {{appearance of}} the woman as she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine growing {{on the side of}} the tavern. As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the watercourse). Through the open window other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E
5|$|Vainio began {{composing}} {{actively in}} the late 1970s, although he had already published his own compositions {{at the beginning of}} the decade. His earliest compositions include Matkarakastaja and Viisari värähtää. Among his most popular songs from the late 1970s is Käyn ahon laitaa ("I Walk <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Side</b> of a Glade") from the 1979 album of the same name. Even though Vainio had already quit drinking, he still occasionally sang about alcohol. Vainio started writing more sensitive songs, a trend which became evident in his next albums. 1981's Albatrossi ja sorsa ("The Albatross and the Duck") contains one of Vainio's most well-known songs, Albatrossi. The topic of the song was lost youth. Another sensitive song on the album is Apteekin ovikello ("The Pharmacy Doorbell"), the idea for which Vainio got from Tapio Rautavaara. Other well-known songs were Panaman konsuli ("The Consul of Panama") and Kun mä rupesin ryyppäämään ("When I Started Drinking").|$|E

5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2010 Winter Olympics, {{to be held in}} Luongo's NHL {{hometown}} of Vancouver, Luongo and Brodeur were considered locks to be named to the national team heading into the summer orientation camp in August 2009 and speculation began as to who would be appointed the starting position. On December 31, 2009, Luongo was selected to Team Canada, along with Brodeur and Marc-André Fleury of the Pittsburgh Penguins as the three goaltenders. Luongo was given the start for the first game against Norway. He recorded his first Olympic shutout, making 15 saves in an 8–0 win to open the tournament. After Brodeur surrendered four goals in a 5–3 loss to the United States in their final preliminary game, Luongo replaced him as the starting goalie. He helped Canada to four consecutive single-elimination game wins against Germany, Russia, Slovakia and the United States to capture the gold medal. During the semifinal against Slovakia, Luongo made a game-saving stop against Canucks teammate Pavol Demitra with nine seconds to go in regulation. With Slovakia's goaltender pulled and down by a goal, the puck bounced to Demitra <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the net. Out of position, Luongo managed to get his glove on the puck, deflecting it away from the net and preserving the win. In the subsequent gold medal game, Luongo made 34 saves in Canada's overtime win against the United States.|$|E
5|$|The other {{predominant}} rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Matt Hardy and Edge, a real life issue transformed into a storyline. At SummerSlam, Edge defeated Hardy after dropping him onto {{the top of a}} ring post. This was scripted to caused Hardy to bleed heavily, which forced the referee to end the match and declare Edge the winner because Hardy could not continue. The next night on Raw, Hardy had a match with Rob Conway, in which Conway pinned Hardy for the win. After the match, Edge attacked Hardy. On the August 29 episode of Raw, Edge and Hardy were scheduled to compete in a Street Fight, a match where there are no disqualifications, no countouts, and scoring conditions can occur anywhere in the arena. The match ended in a no-contest after Hardy and Edge brawled at the stage ramp. Hardy grabbed Edge <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> and threw both himself and Edge off the stage and into electrical equipment. Both Hardy and Edge laid motionless on the floor as sparks flew everywhere. Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took both men away in ambulances for medical attention. The following week, Bischoff booked Hardy and Edge in a steel cage match at Unforgiven, where the ring would be enclosed by a steel cage. Following the announcement, Bischoff scheduled a match between Hardy and Snitsky, which Hardy lost. After the match, Snitsky threatened to hit Hardy with a ring bell but The Big Show came down. He was unable to stop Snitsky, and as a result, Snitsky succeeded in hitting Hardy with the bell.|$|E
