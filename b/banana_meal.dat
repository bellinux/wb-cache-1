40|$|Discarded banana is a {{valuable}} feed ingredient for poultry feed formulations. However, due {{to the presence of}} resistant starches, inclusion of more than 10 % <b>banana</b> <b>meal</b> in poultry rations reduces the growth performance. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether higher levels of <b>banana</b> <b>meal</b> could be included in broiler diets if raw banana is cooked before being processed into meal. Discarded banana (Cavendish) collected at harvesting was processed into two types of banana meals. Cooked <b>banana</b> <b>meal</b> was prepared by cooking banana at 100 oC for 15 minutes and subsequent drying. Uncooked <b>banana</b> <b>meal</b> was prepared by drying at 800 C for three days. Giving a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement, 144 broiler chicks in 48 cages received one of the eight experimental diets containing either cooked or uncooked <b>banana</b> <b>meal</b> at 0, 10, 20 or 30 % ad libitum from day 21 - 42. Birds fed cooked <b>banana</b> <b>meal</b> were significantly heavier on day 28 and 35. Live weight on day 42, weight gain, feed intake or feed conversion efficiency were not affected either by the type or level of <b>banana</b> <b>meal</b> and their interaction. Cooked <b>banana</b> <b>meal</b> increased the weights of the crop and liver significantly. Weight of the small intestine, proventriculus, gizzard abdominal fat pad and the fat free tibia ash contents were not affected by the dietary treatments. It was concluded that uncooked <b>banana</b> <b>meal</b> produced using peeled raw banana can be included up to 30 % in nutritionally balanced broiler finisher diets without any adverse effects on performance...|$|E

Foram produzidos biscoitos com substituição parcial da farinha de trigo por FBV na proporção de 10, 20 e 30 %, e biscoitos Padrão sem FBV. Os biscoitos foram avaliados quanto à composição química, características físicas (diâmetro, espessura e peso) e grau de aceitação. O teste de aceitação dos biscoitos indicou não haver diferença significativa entre as diferentes formulações e o padrão, com exceção para o biscoito tipo III que apresentou menor aceitação (p The {{objective}} of this work was {{to evaluate the use}} of unripe <b>banana</b> <b>meal</b> (UBM) (Musa (AAA group) ‘Dwarf Cavendish’) in the production of cookies. Cookies were produced substituting 10, 20 and 30 % of the wheat flour for UBM, as well as standard cookies without UBM. The chemical compositions, physical features (weight, diameter and thickness) and sensorial characteristics of the cookies were evaluated. A cookie acceptance trial was conducted, which revealed {{no significant difference between the}} formulations containing UBM and the standard, except for the type III cookie, which was less well accepted (p < 0. 05) by children. The chemical composition of the cookies did not differ significantly from the standpoint of moisture and total lipids. The most important differences were found in the starch, total reducing sugars and mineral salts content. The main differences in the cookies’ physical characteristics were their diameters after baking, indicating that UBM altered the properties of the wheat flour. Therefore, in view of the high nutritional value of the cookies containing <b>banana</b> <b>meal,</b> with no significant alteration of their physical and sensorial characteristics, the use of this meal as a partial substitute of wheat flour is viable and can be recommended in the preparation of alternative nutritionally enriched foods...|$|E

40|$|Feedstuff {{availability}} {{is one of}} {{the problems}} in the poultry meat production system, which uses corn as the main energy source in the ration. One of the alternative solutions is to identify the feedstuff that has potential, qualitative and quantitative, to substitute it. Banana tuber contains high carbohydrate and low fber componentsso that it can be used as energy source in the ration. The aim of research was to compare the beneft between the ration containing <b>banana</b> tuber <b>meals,</b> which was provided from batu and kapok banana tuber, and the commercial broiler ration. One hundred and ninety two of broiler chicks were raised for 30 days and were randomly allotted to one of four treatment diets according to completely randomized design with four replications for each treatment. The experimental rations were P 0 (control, 100 %of commercial feed), P 1 (60 % of commercial feed + 30 % of <b>banana</b> tuber <b>meal</b> + 10 % fsh meal), P 2 (70 % of commercial feed + 20 % of <b>banana</b> tuber <b>meal</b> + 10 % fsh meal), and P 3 (80 % of commercial feed + 10 % of <b>banana</b> tuber <b>meal</b> + 10 % fsh meal).

40|$|Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) {{is widely}} grown in sub-{{tropical}} and tropical areas, producing roots as an energy source while the top biomass including leaves and immature stems can be sun-dried {{and used as}} cassava hay. Cassava roots can be processed as dried chip or pellet. It is rich in soluble carbohydrate (75 to 85 %) but low in crude protein (2 to 3 %). Its energy value is comparable to corn meal but has a relatively higher rate of rumen degradation. Higher levels of non-protein nitrogen especially urea (1 to 4 %) can be successfully incorporated in concentrates containing cassava chip as an energy source. Cassava chip can also be processed with urea and other ingredients (tallow, sulfur, raw <b>banana</b> <b>meal,</b> cassava hay, and soybean meal) to make products such as cassarea, cassa-ban, and cassaya. Various {{studies have been conducted}} in ruminants using cassava chip to replace corn meal in the concentrate mixtures and have revealed satisfactory results in rumen fermentation efficiency and the subsequent production of meat and milk. In addition, it was advantageous when used in combination with rice bran in the concentrate supplement. Practical home-made-concentrate using cassava chip can be easily prepared for use on farms. A recent development has involved enriching protein in cassava chips, yielding yeast fermented cassava chip protein (YEFECAP) of up to 47. 5 % crude protein, which can be used to replace soybean meal. It is therefore, recommended to use cassava chip as an alternative source of energy to corn meal when the price is economical and it is locally available...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work {{was to determine the}} nutritional value and the strategies of using green <b>banana</b> <b>meal</b> (BM) in growing pigs. Two trials involving a total of 96 growing pigs were designed to study the effect of the harvest stage on the nutritional and energy values of BM (trial 1) and to evaluate the consequence of feeding gradual levels of BM on growth performance and feeding behavior in growing pigs (trial 2). In trial 1, the digestive utilization of three diets including 40 % BM were compared with a control (C) soybean meal-corn diet in two batches of 12 pigs. BM was obtained from fruits harvested at 750 degrees-days (DD; early harvesting stage), 900 DD (normal harvesting stage) and 1150 DD (late harvesting stage). In trial 2, 72 Large White pigs were grouped in pens of nine animals and were given ad libitum access to one of the four dietary treatments (two pens/diet) differing from the rate of inclusion of 900 DD BM (0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %). The estimated energy apparent digestibility coefficients of BM increased with the harvest stage (75. 5 %, 80. 7 % and 83. 2 % for BM at 750, 900 and 1150 DD, respectively). Digestible energy and metabolizable energy values were higher for BM at 1150 DD (13. 56 and 13. 05 MJ/kg DM, respectively) than at 900 DD (13. 11 and 12. 75 MJ/kg DM, respectively) or at 750 DD (12. 00 and 11. 75 MJ/kg DM, respectively). In trial 2, average daily gain and feed conversion ratio were not affected (P> 0. 05) by the rate of BM inclusion (822 g/day and 2. 75 kg/kg on average, respectively). Feed intake and feeding behavior parameters were not significantly influenced by the dietary treatments except for the rate of feed ingestion with a lower value for the diet with 40 % of BM (27. 4 v. 32. 2 g/min on average; P< 0. 01) when compared with the other diets.

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} of {{two separate}} studies. A survey of small-scale chicken production (layer and broiler) in Laos {{is presented in}} Part 1 and the characterisation of local feed ingredients is presented in Part 2. Part 1 examined aspects of demographic details, breeds and sources, management systems, labour, diseases, production parameters, marketing and farmer attitude in small-scale chicken farms. For the survey of layer farms, a total of 35 farmers from Xaythany and Naxaithong districts were interviewed. All producers were over 30 years of age. Almost 75 % of interviewees were males, showing that males {{play a significant role}} in the leadership in the families. The average hen day production was found to be 0. 65 and an average of 1. 81 kg feed was required to produce a dozen eggs. It was observed that this feed conversion efficiency level was similar to those reported in some tropical countries, but poorer than the recommendation by breeding companies for modern layers (1. 58 kg feed/dozen eggs). Hens were culled after 18 months of production (around 2 years of age). During this period, a hen produced an average of 242 eggs, which was lower than the 300 or more eggs expected for modern layers under optimum conditions. Number factors are responsible for the poor layer performance under small farm conditions in Laos, with poor management being the main cause. This problem can be solved by the involvement of government and better veterinary and extension services. The average mortality was 11 %; diarrhoea and bird flu were the main causes associated with the deaths. Vaccines and drugs were regularly used by all farms. For the broiler survey, 7 broiler farms in Naxaithong district were surveyed. All farms operated under contract with a large company (Charoen Pokphand Laos Company). The annual broiler output per farm ranged from 15, 000 to 24, 000 birds. The number of production cycles per year and the type of breed provided are decided by the company. Three breeds are raised, namely Ross 308, Brown Nick and 3 -line crossbreeds. The average market age was 8. 6 weeks at an average body weight at 1. 5 kg. The FCR (feed conversion ratio) was 2. 1 kg feed/kg gain. Although all farms received good quality feed and regular monitoring from the CP Company, the feed efficiency was higher compared to breeding company standards (1. 6 kg feed/kg gain). The average mortality was 1. 4 %. Ross 308 was found to be more susceptible to the hot environment than the other two breeds. Deaths in Ross 308 were related largely to the faster growth rate. The study reported in Part 2 aimed at characterising the nutrient contents of locally available poultry feedstuffs so that dependence on imported commercial feeds can be reduced. Fifteen local feedstuffs (rice bran, broken rice, cassava leaf meal, cassava root meal, coconut meal, fish meal, green <b>banana</b> <b>meal,</b> groundnut, leucaena leaf meal, maize, sesame seed, snail meal, soybean, sweet potato tuber meal and taro meal) were collected. Each sample was analysed for proximate composition, minerals and amino acids. Of the tested ingredients, fishmeal had the highest crude protein content (54. 4 g/ 100 g), while sweet potato tuber meal had the lowest crude protein content (3. 5 g/ 100 g). The highest crude fat value (65. 0 g/ 100 g) determined for full-fat copra, followed by sesame and groundnut seeds (54. 8 and 54. 4 g/ 100 g, respectively). Roce bran had the highest fibre content (14. 7 g/ 100 g) and snail meal the highest ash content (71. 3 g/ 100 g). Snail meal had the highest calcium content (30. 0 g/ 100 g) followed by fish meal (4. 50 g/ 100 g). Snail meal was also rich in t iron, copper, manganese and zinc. Fish meal had high contents of amino acids. Whereas cassavas root meal had the lowest...|$|E
