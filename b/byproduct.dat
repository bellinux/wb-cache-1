Bismuth is mostly a <b>byproduct</b> of the smelting of lead, and also of tungsten and copper production. Recycling bismuth is difficult in many of its end uses, primarily because of scattering.|$|E

Unfortunately, oversized and inappropriately large colonies, due to their increased numbers, excrete increased amounts of these <b>byproducts.</b> As the amount of microbial <b>byproducts</b> increases, the higher waste <b>byproducts</b> levels can overburden the body's waste removal mechanisms.|$|R
40|$|Research {{conducted}} at the University of Nebraska has evaluated wet and dry distillers <b>byproducts</b> as energy sources for cattle. The majority of the {{research has been conducted}} with distillers <b>byproducts</b> resulting from the fermentation of corn. However, in the dry milling industry various cereal grains may be used to produce ethanol and distillers <b>byproducts.</b> The resulting <b>byproducts</b> have the potential to have a different feeding value when compared to <b>byproducts</b> produced from corn. A Nebraska trial (1995 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 25 - 26) conducted by Lodge et al. indicated steers consuming diets containing distillers <b>byproducts</b> (40 % of diet DM) produced from the fermentation of primarily sorghum gained less and were less efficient than previous research with coin <b>byproducts</b> would have predicted. These data imply that distillers <b>byproducts</b> produced from grain sorghum may have a lower feeding value than corn based distillers <b>byproducts.</b> One explanation for this difference in performance may be related to differences in digestibility between corn and sorghum distillers <b>byproducts.</b> Therefore, a lamb digestibility trial was conducted to evaluate the digestibility of wet and dried distillers <b>byproducts</b> produced from the fermentation of corn or sorghum...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The present work {{aimed at}} {{studying}} {{the effect of}} different drying methods applied to tilapia <b>byproducts</b> (heads, viscera and carcasses) fed with flaxseed, verifying the contents of omega- 3 fatty acids. Two diets {{were given to the}} tilapia: a control and a flaxseed formulation, over the course of 60 days. After this period, they were slaughtered and their <b>byproducts</b> (heads, viscera and carcasses) were collected. These fish parts were analyzed in natura, lyophilized and oven dried. <b>Byproducts</b> from tilapia fed with flaxseed presented docosapentaenoic, eicopentaenoic and docosahexanoic fatty acids {{as a result of the}} enzymatic metabolism of the fish. The <b>byproducts</b> from the oven drying process had lower levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In the multivariate analysis, the <b>byproducts</b> from fish fed with flaxseed had a greater composition of fatty acids. The addition of flaxseed in fish diets, as well as the utilization of their <b>byproducts,</b> may become a good business strategy. Additionally, the <b>byproducts</b> may be dried to facilitate transport and storage...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the behaviour, uptake and ecotoxicity of TiO 2 <b>byproducts</b> in the earthworm Eisenia fetida. Worms were exposed to suspensions containing 0. 1, 1 and 10 mg/L of <b>byproducts</b> for 24 h. Size of TiO 2 <b>byproducts</b> showed aggregation of particles up to 700 mu m with laser diffraction. Only worms exposed at 10 mg/L showed bioaccumulation of titanium (ICP-AES), increasing expression of metallothionein and superoxide dismutase mRNA (Real-time PCR) and induction of apoptotic activity (Apostain and TUNEL). TiO 2 <b>byproducts</b> did not induce cytotoxicity on ccelomocytes, but a significant decrease of phagocytosis was observed starting from 0. 1 mg/L In conclusion, bioaccumulation of <b>byproducts</b> and their production of reactive oxygen species could be responsible for the alteration of the antioxidant system in worms.

40|$|Purification process <b>byproducts</b> are {{residual}} materials generated from production processes to isolate specific chemicals or compounds. These secondary materials {{are made up}} largely of organic compounds that have a high molecular weight but are only somewhat volatile. Due to these characteristics, purification process <b>byproducts</b> are combustible but generally not flammable (Raiders et al. 2009). Purification process <b>byproducts</b> may be generated from several different processes, including distillation, extraction, and evaporation (EIA 2000).

5|$|Selenium is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a <b>byproduct,</b> obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, a process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a <b>byproduct</b> of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.|$|E

The refinery production in 2010 was 16,000 tonnes, of which China produced 13,000, Mexico 850 and Belgium 800 tonnes.

The prepared iron oxidation <b>byproducts</b> were characterized using Xray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, zeta potential, BET surface area, and particle size analyses. XRD analysis showed that the prepared iron oxidation <b>byproducts</b> were composed mostly of lepidocrocite, maghemite, and magnetite. These flaked off iron oxidation <b>byproducts</b> were used alone (without ZVI) to remove phosphate. Equilibrium and kinetic studies were conducted to determine the sorption capacities and the rate of phosphate ion uptake at various pH values by the prepared <b>byproducts.</b> The experimental data showed that phosphate sorption adhered to a pseudo second order kinetic model and the maximum sorption capacity was determined at 2. 5 mg P per g. Phosphate removal capacities of synthetic pure iron oxides and oxy-hydroxides were also determined. Raman and FTIR spectroscopy showed that phosphate was retained by inner sphere complexation.
