500|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the indoor-outdoor {{thermometer}} is to allow the outside temperature to be indicated inside a building, thus removing the need to go outside to take a temperature reading. [...] They are also used in vehicles, and are particularly useful for municipal vehicles involved in snow and ice clearance. <b>Building</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>engineers</b> can use an indoor-outdoor thermometer that has not been installed to get a quick reading of air temperature in a location inside a building. [...] This is done by swinging the bulb of the outdoor sensor in the air while still attached to the instrument. This will get a faster reading because the bulb will come up to temperature much more quickly than the indoor sensor built into the instrument.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} the importance of a proper <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> management system becomes the main contributing factor for the development of facilities management worldwide. Various <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> management system tools become necessary to remain competitive. The widespread use of mobile devices envisions a growing market for new applications in <b>building</b> <b>maintenance.</b> It is well-understood that the use of mobile technologies is critical in <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> as the right information needs to be delivered to the right person, at the right time, and at the right place. However, existing <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> applications only support the delivery of static modes of information (such as building data and checklists); the information is pre-programmed and is thus not able {{to take into account the}} users varying contexts. <b>Building</b> <b>maintenance</b> applications could be made easy and responsive to users wishes if they were context-aware.

40|$|With {{a growing}} number of aged {{buildings}} which need to undergo maintenance works in Hong Kong, disputes concerning <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> works has become increasingly common in recent years. There have been contentions that bid-rigging activities involved during the tendering process of these projects. Bid-rigging in <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> works is a social problem as all buildings will become aged and required to carry out <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> works. It is illegal and harmful to the society as the affected group of people would be extensively covering all types of occupants in terms of cost and living environment. In the event that bid-rigging arises during tendering process of the <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> works, flat owners not only have to pay additional amount of money out of the exorbitant <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> cost, but they have to bear the risk of works which cannot be properly done. In addition, it implies various parties have participated in the tendering process enabling the building consultants or building contractors to win the maintenance contract fraudulently. Such incidents also reflected that there may be grey areas in legislation which enhances the emergence of bid-rigging in <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> works. Although there are various kinds of supporting schemes from the government and related organizations to assist building owners to carry out maintenance works, the effectiveness of the schemes remain unknown regarding the increasing disputes arise from <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> works and bid-rigging. The study would have a deeper understanding for the causes and effects of bid-rigging in relation to <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> works in terms of building condition, assistance and policies provided by the government and relevant organizations to assist building owners in Hong Kong. These include technical and financial assistance on <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> works, education for prevention and detection of infraction in collusive behavior, and legislation and prosecution on alleged crimes. In the final part, recommendations would be made to avoid bid-rigging in <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> works. The goals of the study is to identify the cause of the problem of bid-rigging in <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> works in Hong Kong and make possible suggestions to prevent the bid-rigging in <b>building</b> <b>maintenance</b> works. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
