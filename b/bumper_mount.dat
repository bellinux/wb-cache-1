25|$|This tent is {{most often}} seen in a yellow/blue-grey stripe, but were also {{available}} in red/white, orange/blue, orange/white, and green/white. The tent's frame mounts to brackets {{on the roof and}} bumpers. The front <b>bumper</b> <b>mount</b> is a flat plate of steel bent into an open S or Z shape. Tent poles are steel, either black or grey, around 2cm in diameter, and there are fourteen sections that must be assembled to create a rectangular, peaked awning with support rods leading to the bumpers. Once the awning has been set up, curtains can be attached to the three outer sides (with Tenax lift-the-dot fasteners) to achieve a weatherproof - though windowless and floorless - portable shelter. Leather straps secure the sidewalls to the support poles, and stakes hold the bottom edges down as with the small tent. An additional set of poles and stakes were available to permit the outer flap to be extended horizontally as a second awning, resulting in a large shaded space {{on the side of the}} bus.|$|E
50|$|After 13 {{years of}} production, 1997 saw the Cherokee receive updated {{exterior}} and interior styling. Both the two- and four-door bodies remained in production, receiving a steel liftgate (replacing the fiberglass one used previously), restyled taillights, additional plastic molding along the doors, {{as well as a}} new front header panel that featured more aerodynamic styling. The spare tire was moved from a rear exterior <b>bumper</b> <b>mount</b> to an interior location due to de-contenting the rear bumper. A new, unique spare tire carrier was invented by Peter Gruich while working for Jeep Special Programs that utilized the trailer hitch bar and a unique pivot bracket and although it was the only external spare tire carrier to pass the full Jeep durability test, it was not offered for sale.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most famous}} {{shot of the}} chase is made from a front <b>bumper</b> <b>mount</b> and shows a low-angle point of view shot of the streets racing by. Director of {{photography}} Owen Roizman, wrote in American Cinematographer magazine in 1972 that the camera was undercranked to 18 frames per second to enhance the sense of speed. Roizman's contention is borne out {{when you see a}} car at a red light whose muffler is pumping smoke at an accelerated rate. Other shots involved stunt drivers who were supposed to barely miss hitting the speeding car, but due to errors in timing, accidental collisions occurred and were left in the final film. Friedkin said that he used Santana's cover of Fleetwood Mac's song [...] "Black Magic Woman" [...] during editing to help shape the chase sequence; though the song does not appear in the film, [...] "it chase scene did have a sort of pre-ordained rhythm to it that came from the music." ...|$|E

50|$|Fleetwood Brougham {{was most}} luxurious model on the US market at that time. It {{included}} many comfort features, but {{could also be}} a true powerhouse for towing. By the 1978 owners manual the maximum trailer weight could be 6000lbs or 2721kg. It could either have <b>bumper</b> <b>mounted</b> towing point or frame rail mounted towing point.|$|R
50|$|On the inside, the Diablo GT {{featured}} {{more prominent}} carbon fiber panels, race-spec bucket seats with 4-point seatbelt harnesses, a smaller steering wheel, and an optional Alpine LCD screen for GPS navigation and a <b>bumper</b> <b>mounted</b> backup camera. Despite the racing pretenses of the vehicle, air conditioning was still installed as standard equipment; airbags could be optionally omitted.|$|R
5000|$|According to Acura the {{exterior}} is more aerodynamic reducing drag by 16% {{with the new}} model lapping Nürburgring 8 seconds faster than its predecessor. The headlights are Acura's Jewel Eye LED Headlights (first introduced on the RLX). [...] Each headlamp uses five separate LED sources with three used for low-beam lighting and two for high-beam lighting. LED <b>bumper</b> <b>mounted</b> fog lamps are offered as a dealer installed option.|$|R
5000|$|This same <b>bumper</b> <b>mounted</b> {{radar system}} is {{utilised}} for the Active Cruise Control (ACC) feature on the Exclusive+ trim. The radar {{is able to}} detect the distance and speed of vehicles and slow the vehicle or brake if necessary to avoid a collision.The dashboard user interface was also upgraded, now featuring a twelve inch panoramic color display which allows for the display of navigation, and other road assistance tools, {{with a degree of}} customization.|$|R
5000|$|Sahara: {{which came}} {{standard}} with most available options, including body color fender flares and steel wheels, also {{included with the}} Sahara edition are special green trail-cloth seats with storage pockets, interior door panels with pockets, front <b>bumper</b> <b>mounted</b> fog lamps, and plastic ends on the front bumper). An AM/FM stereo with cassette player, rear speaker sound bar, unique cloth-and-vinyl high-back bucket seats, rear removable bench seat, exterior color steel wheels, and air conditioning were all standard on this model.|$|R
2500|$|The new styling {{increased}} the trunk capacity of both coupes and sedans to [...] This increase was also partially achieved with a now-standard compact spare tire on a [...] wheel. A new frame lift jack replaced the <b>bumper</b> <b>mounted</b> model. A larger [...] fuel tank was standard equipment in sedans and coupes. Easy-roll radial tires, improved anti-corrosion measures, low friction ball joints and larger front suspension bushings were also new for 1980. Puncture-sealant tires and cornering lights were new options.|$|R
5000|$|The Falcon XL was {{introduced}} in August 1962, replacing the Falcon XK which had been in production since 1960. Visual changes from the XK included a new convex grille, <b>bumper</b> <b>mounted</b> park/turn lights, new taillights, and a revised, squared off roofline (on the sedans) which was promoted as the “Thunderbird roofline”. Other changes included a new manual gearbox (although {{it was still a}} three-speed unit), new clutch, new starter motor, new air cleaner, new suspension system and a new carburettor.|$|R

50|$|The Ambassador {{received}} longer, squared-off rear fenders with vertical wrap-around taillights, taller decklid, {{squared off}} rear <b>bumper</b> <b>mounted</b> low, and squarer rear wheel arches. At the front, the Ambassador again sparked minor controversy {{with its new}} vertically stacked quad headlights, which were slightly recessed in their bezels, as they flanked an all-new horizontal bar grille. This new wall-to-wall grille projected forward, horizontally, in the center, to create an effect somewhat opposite to 1963's grille treatment. The front end design provided a bold, rugged appearance.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was to be}} {{a limited}} {{production}} of 333 cars worldwide, 35 UK, 90 USA, this rare version of R8 Coupé 5.2 FSI quattro with curb weight reduced by 100 kg to 1525 kg, increased engine power to [...] ( [...] per ton). Because of these changes the R8 GT has a top speed of 199 mph and goes from 0-100 km/h in 3.6 seconds, 0.3 faster than the R8 V10. The car also features some visual changes including red brake caliper covers, a fixed rear wing, front <b>bumper</b> <b>mounted</b> winglets and GT badges replacing the V10 ones.|$|R
5000|$|Only minor styling {{changes were}} made on this year's Cutlass models. These {{included}} flush taillight lenses and new grilles up front, including a fascia with <b>bumper</b> <b>mounted</b> turn signals on the base model not shared {{with any of the}} other trim levels. There were newly mandated 5 mph rear bumpers (joining the 5 mph front bumpers mandated in '73), with a new hydraulic energy absorpotion system. [...] Both the 350 and 455 Rocket V8s were carried over unchanged from 1973 aside from revisions required to meet 1974 emission regulations. The Turbo Hydra-matic transmission became standard equipment on all Cutlass models.|$|R

A large contact-sensing mechanical <b>bumper</b> is <b>mounted</b> on the front half of the unit, with an omnidirectional infrared sensor at its top front center. A recessed carrying handle is fitted {{on the top of}} most units.|$|R
50|$|For 1974, North American models {{received}} newly required 5 mph impact <b>bumpers</b> <b>mounted</b> on self-restoring energy absorbers, which added approximately 25 mm to the car's overall length. On the Super Beetle, {{the steering}} knuckle, and consequently the lower attachment {{point of the}} strut, was redesigned to improve handling {{and stability in the}} event of a tire blowout. A limited-edition Big Beetle was introduced based on the 1303 LS. Available in unique metallic paint colors, the car featured styled-steel 5.5 in wide sport wheels wrapped in 175/70-15 tires, corduroy seat inserts, upgraded loop-pile carpet, wood-look instrument panel trim and a padded steering wheel with bright accents. In the North American market, a limited-edition Sun Bug was introduced as a standard Beetle or Super Beetle. Both were finished in metallic gold and featured styled-steel 4.5 in-wide sport wheels. Inside were brown corduroy and leatherette seats, loop-pile carpet, and padded four-spoke deluxe steering wheel. The Super Beetle Sun Bug included a sliding-steel sunroof.|$|R
50|$|The lower <b>bumper</b> {{brackets}} feature <b>mounting</b> stand-offs for a {{steering servo}} {{on both the}} front and rear axle, allowing for either a typical front-steering arrangement or a full four-wheel steering setup.|$|R
50|$|The rear <b>bumper</b> {{was also}} <b>mounted</b> on new impact-absorbing {{extensions}} which caused the bumper to protrude {{from the body}} further than before, and the 1973 Mach 1 graphics were also changed. Engine options remained {{the same as in}} 1972.|$|R
50|$|Early (Series 1) 1750 GTV's {{featured}} the same bumpers as the Giulia Sprint GT Veloce, {{with the front}} <b>bumper</b> modified to <b>mount</b> the indicator / sidelight units {{on the top of}} its corners, or under the bumper on US market cars.|$|R
2500|$|The 1973 {{model year}} VAM Hornets were {{redesigned}} and incorporated a new front end design with larger horizontal rectangular side marker lights, semi-square headlight bezels, and a [...] "V"-shaped grille and hood edge. The front bumper included AMC's five-mile-per-hour design, {{but without the}} recovering shocks; in their place were regular rigid <b>bumper</b> <b>mounts</b> as in previous years. The automobile product standards in Mexico were less restrictive than in the U.S.; thus, VAMs <b>mounted</b> the <b>bumpers</b> placed closer to the body than their AMC counterparts. The 232 engine {{was replaced by the}} AMC [...] I6 rated at [...] gross with Carter RBS/YF one-barrel carburetor, 266 degree camshaft, and an 8.5:1 compression ratio. The three-speed automatic transmission for the first time became available in the sedan models as an option and the rear differential gear ratio changed to 3.31:1 in all units. Other features included new door panels, longer narrower inside door latches, controls for the cigarette lighter, wiper/washer, and lights knobs had rubber knobs, modified tail light lenses, the deletion of the rectangular [...] "RAMBLER" [...] emblem in favor of [...] "American" [...] script on the rear panel, [...] "258" [...] emblems replacing the [...] "232 SIX" [...] rectangular ones and the removal of the bullseye emblems on the C-pillar base.|$|R
50|$|In October 1966 a minor {{facelift}} took place. The car was lightened somewhat, new <b>bumpers</b> were <b>mounted,</b> and {{the spare}} tire was {{moved from the}} front to the engine room, freeing up scarce luggage space. Also, the gearbox was now fully synchronized. The last modification took place in 1969, when in response to stricter safety standards a driver's side headrest and provisions for seatbelts were fitted. Production continued until August 1970, by which time 265,226 Carol 360s had been built. Mazda did not offer a Kei class passenger car for two years, until the 1972 introduction of the Chantez.|$|R
50|$|The federalized Khamsin {{went on sale}} in 1975. These models {{required}} fitting a solid {{version of}} the glass tail panel. The tail lights had to be moved downward, to the rear bumpers' former location; the new, protruding <b>bumper</b> was <b>mounted</b> below the tail lights. This new configuration of components left the exhaust tips unable to clear the bumper, a problem resolved flipping the exhaust resonators upside down. The front bumper was also replaced by a bigger one. Square side markers found their way {{on the front and}} rear wings.The engine had to be revised too, gaining smog control equipment (air injection, thermal reactors in the exhaust manifolds, different carburettors and leaner fuel mixture) and losing 5 hp.|$|R
50|$|The first {{generation}} Prairies were innovative vehicles - featuring no B-pillar between {{the front and}} rear doors (instead the interlocking front and sliding rear doors locked onto both the floor and roof of the vehicle); front seatbelts mounted on the doors (excluding the US versions) that facilitated a totally unimpeded side entrance; front seats that could be slid {{all the way to the}} front of the passenger compartment and fully reclined; rear seats that could not only be folded away conventionally, but could also be reclined fully to make a double bed (in combination with the front seats); rear window winders that folded into themselves (to prevent catching when the doors were slid open); tailgate that opened to the floor of the luggage compartment (the center section of the rear <b>bumper</b> was <b>mounted</b> on the tailgate); optional front-facing third row of seats. This type of entry was later introduced on the Toyota Isis, but only on the passenger side.|$|R
5000|$|The Fellow also {{received}} a slight facelift in October 1967, with a new dashboard and steering wheel most noticeable. Another minor change came in January 1969, with a fixed driver's side headrest and seatbelts installed because of new safety regulations. In July, along with what was literally a facelift (the front <b>bumper</b> was now <b>mounted</b> higher), the lesser engine's output increased to 26 PS and a comparatively luxurious [...] "Custom" [...] version was added {{at the top of}} the lineup. The size of the taillights also increased somewhat. An electric version called the Daihatsu Fellow Van EV went on sale in September 1969.|$|R
5000|$|See also Ford CapriThe Capri {{was built}} in Cologne, Germany, and was sold through Lincoln-Mercury dealers in North America. The European Capri was first sold in the US in April 1970. It did not carry Lincoln or Mercury marque identification. The only type {{initially}} available used the British 1600-cc Kent crossflow, with a starting price less than US$2300. The 2.0-L OHC I4 was introduced for the 1971 model year. The '71 2.0-liter Capris are particularly desirable, since they have a 9.0:1 compression ratio (which was reduced to 8.2:1 in 1972). The 2.6-L [...] "Cologne" [...] V6 was introduced late in the 1972 model year.In 1973, the Capri was given a [...] "facelift" [...] for the model year with a revised grille, larger tail lights, and revised rear quarter [...] "grills." [...] North American-spec Capris received a federally mandated 5-mph front bumper. The chrome <b>bumper</b> was <b>mounted</b> {{in front of a}} steel pipe and attached to the frame by shock absorbers. The interior received revised seat trims, dashboard, and steering wheel. A new, different wiring harness was used.|$|R
2500|$|The fixed {{undercarriage}} {{consists of}} large paired main-wheel units on oleo-pneumatic levered shock absorbers mounted {{at the junction}} of [...] a strut system supporting the rotor systems and wings and connected to the centre fuselage by a tripod strut structure with the nose-leg attached aft of the crew section. A pair of <b>bumper</b> wheels are <b>mounted</b> {{at the rear of}} the fuselage keel and fixed support pads ensure that the cargo ramp is extended to the correct angle. Long braced struts also connected the transmission units to the rear fuselage forward of the fin. Cargo handling is by forklift or electric hoists on traveling beams.|$|R
2500|$|The Arab Oil Embargo of October 1973 {{came just}} as the 1974 model year began. AMC {{improved}} the Gremlin's back seat. A deeper front fascia made the car appear longer. A larger front <b>bumper</b> was <b>mounted</b> on self-restoring telescoping gas and oil cylinders. Unlike most other designs, the Gremlin did not use filler panel between bumper and body. A stronger rear bumper was set lower—front and rear passenger car bumpers were now required by NHTSA to have uniform heights, take angle impacts, and sustain [...] impacts with no damage. The rear fascia was modified slightly to blend with the design changes. The Gremlin X stripe pattern was given a [...] "hockey stick" [...] look for 1974: the stripes followed the window line as it tapered aft, and swept up now to include four diagonal lines on the wide C-pillar. A new typeface for nameplates was used by AMC for 1974, including on the Gremlin. With the car's 1974 model year extended into November to delay the need to install catalytic converters required by United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2004 regulations starting with 1975 models, AMC sold 171,128 1974 Gremlins, an increase of nearly 40% over 1973 and 130% over 1971.|$|R
40|$|Developing {{high-performance}} {{energy absorbing}} materials is es-sential {{to the design}} of protective and damping structures, such as car <b>bumpers,</b> body armors, <b>mounting</b> stages, etc. For the past decade, intensive studies have been conducted on nanocomposites [1 - 5]. Recently, the energy absorption charac-teristics of liquid suspensions of nanoporous particles (LSNP) have received considerable attention [6 - 10]. By immersing hy-drophobic nanoporous particles in water, the liquid phase can enter the nanopores when a high pressure is applied. Once the pressure induced infiltration occurs, most of the nanopore sur-face can be exposed to the liquid, leading to a significant in-crease in system free energy, A⋅∆γ, where is the excess solid-liquid interface tension and A is the specific area of the nanoporous material, often in the range of 102 – 103 m 2 /g. Typi-cally, is at the level of 10 – 102 mJ/m 2, and thus the energ...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the body}} style {{remained}} the same throughout the Challenger's five-year run, there were two notable changes to the front grille. The 1971 models had a [...] "split" [...] grille, while 1972 introduced a design that extended the grille (nicknamed the [...] "sad-mouth") beneath the front bumper. With this change to the front end, 1972 through 1974 models had little to no variation. The only way to properly distinguish them is that the 1972s had flush <b>mounted</b> <b>bumpers</b> with no bumper guards, (small bumper guards were optional), while both the 1973 and 1974 models had the protruding [...] "5 mph" [...] bumpers (with a rubber type filler behind them) in conjunction with large bumper guards. The 1974 cars had larger rear bumper guards to meet the (new for 1974 and on) rear 5 mph rear impact law. These changes were made to meet U.S. regulations regarding crash test safety.|$|R
40|$|Vehicular bumper is a {{structure}} mounted {{at the front}} and rear of the vehicle to absorb the first impact and is designed to minimize its effect on the vehicle structure and its occupants. Although vehicle collision is an unavoidable fact, there are no reported attempts to date in exploring the feasibility of detection system utilizing sensors. For this investigation, PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride) sensor for its sensitivity and dynamic range is selected for application to bumpers. A prototype bumper with PVDF sensors is fabricated to carry out tests under low level forces. A prototype bumper represented by a Plexiglass beam is mounted with a series of PVDF sensors across the length, while the <b>bumper</b> is <b>mounted</b> on a rigid structure through set of mounts. Each sensor is calibrated for various loads on and away from the sensor and tested to predict the magnitude of the force and corresponding position. Several configurations for the bumper with and without cover over the sensor surface are experimented to determine the collision detection capability of the bumper in terms of magnitude, duration and location of the impact. The time history response of each sensor and its characteristics are utilized to develop layouts for bumper systems with sensors. Two designs were fabricated and tested in the laboratory to establish methodology for establishing relationships between sensor responses with magnitude and location of collision. Based on the investigation, a final design is proposed for implementation of collision detection in automotive bumpers...|$|R
