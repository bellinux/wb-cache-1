5|$|Dax confides in Sisko {{that she}} knows she {{is in love with}} her former wife. He tells her that Trill customs mean that if they resumed their relationship, then they would be exiled from their homeworld and their {{symbionts}} would never be joined with a new host, but that she will have his support either way. Kahn and Dax continue to work on the experiment, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> wrong and Defiant is severely damaged. Kahn is injured in the explosion, but Dax rigs a force field across a plasma fire that allows her to reach Kahn, coming to the realization that the relationship is worth exile. After returning to the station, Kahn recuperates from her injuries. She decides against resuming her relationship with Dax, and—with the experiments complete—departs with the science team, leaving Dax heartbroken.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game's events, Doctor Eggman {{builds a}} robotic {{assistant}} named Gemerl, using parts from the robot Emerl who {{was destroyed in}} Sonic Battle. Eggman attempts an experiment using the Chaos Emeralds to perform the Chaos Control technique, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> awry and tears the world apart. This action separates Sonic and Tails from Amy, Knuckles, and Cream, all of whom Eggman finds and captures, intending to create a segment of his impending empire on each chunk of the planet. Sonic and Tails travel through the game's seven levels to recapture their friends and retrieve the Emeralds.|$|E
25|$|In cricket, a googly (or wrong 'un) {{is a type}} of {{deceptive}} delivery bowled by a right-arm leg spin bowler. In Australia, it is occasionally {{referred to}} as a Bosie (or Bosey), an eponym in honour of its inventor Bernard Bosanquet. A leg spin bowler bowls in a leg spin way <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> in the off side direction.|$|E

25|$|Paradoxically, the subdiscipline of {{environmental}} physiology {{is on the}} one hand a recent field of study in plant ecology {{and on the other hand}} one of the oldest. Environmental physiology is the preferred name of the subdiscipline among plant physiologists, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> by a number of other names in the applied sciences. It is roughly synonymous with ecophysiology, crop ecology, horticulture and agronomy. The particular name applied to the subdiscipline is specific to the viewpoint and goals of research. Whatever name is applied, it deals with the ways in which plants respond to their environment and so overlaps with the field of ecology.|$|E
25|$|A third {{reason for}} {{reservation}} is, {{in the following}} of the Easter Triduum of the Roman Catholic Church and in many Anglican churches, after {{the celebration of the}} Mass of the Lord's Supper a vigil is kept before the sacrament, placed on an Altar of Repose or similar place of reservation, until the Good Friday service at which, by tradition, there is no celebration of Mass, but the faithful receive from the reserved sacrament in the Communion part of the Celebration of the Lord's Passion. There is then no celebration until the Easter Vigil in the night leading to Easter Sunday. This pattern, revived in 1955 under Pope Pius XII, was incorporated into the liturgical reforms that followed the Second Vatican Council, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> back to the liturgy of Jerusalem, recorded by Egeria in the 4th century.|$|E
500|$|The message {{throughout}} the song, in which Martin sings, is words of encouragement: [...] "Lights will guide you home / And ignite your bones / And I {{will try to}} fix you." [...] Michele Hatty of USA Weekend reported that Martin sings about recovering from grief in the song. Travis Gass of the Bangor Daily News wrote that Martin offers his sympathies for the downtrodden, with [...] "When you love someone <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> to waste / Could it be worse?".|$|E

500|$|In the episode, {{after the}} {{creation}} of the Bear Patrol, bear sightings decrease to zero, so Homer concludes that the Bear Patrol must be working. Lisa attempts to demonstrate Homer's logical fallacy by the example of a tiger-repellent rock, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> over his head. Scott Anthony of the Harvard Business Review describes this scene as a [...] "classic example" [...] of the informal fallacy of assuming that correlation implies causation. Mike Moffatt also called it [...] "the best all-time discussion of faulty reasoning".|$|E
500|$|Except for the ending, {{the plots}} of Liliom and Carousel are very similar. [...] Andreas Zavocky (nicknamed Liliom, the Hungarian word for [...] "lily", a slang term for [...] "tough guy"), a {{carnival}} barker, {{falls in love}} with Julie Zeller, a servant girl, and they begin living together. [...] With both discharged from their jobs, Liliom is discontented and contemplates leaving Julie, but decides not to do so on learning that she is pregnant. [...] A subplot involves Julie's friend Marie, who has fallen in love with Wolf Biefeld, a hotel porter—after the two marry, he becomes the owner of the hotel. [...] Desperate to make money so that he, Julie and their child can escape to America and a better life, Liliom conspires with lowlife Ficsur to commit a robbery, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> badly, and Liliom stabs himself. [...] He dies, and his spirit is taken to heaven's police court. [...] As Ficsur suggested while the two waited to commit the crime, would-be robbers like them do not come before God Himself. [...] Liliom is told by the magistrate that he may go back to Earth for one day to attempt to redeem the wrongs he has done to his family, but must first spend sixteen years in a fiery purgatory.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by critics who praised the collaboration between Rowland and Guetta. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said [...] "It {{looks as though}} they're going to be ruling the airwaves all over again... After she lulls us into {{a false sense of}} security ("I feel like the DJ is bodyguard / You see the way he keeps me safe? / With the treble and the bass?"), the track plunges into a pounding electro-house chorus that quite literally orders us to the dance floor... The result isn't quite as fresh and inventive as some of Guetta's recent output – Kelis' [...] 'Acapella', for example – <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> a long way towards recapturing some of last summer's magic." [...] The site's other reviewer, Nick Levine, agreed saying that the song [...] "thumps as persuasively as Muhammad Ali circa 1967." [...] Robert Daw of Idolator said [...] "if you think Ms. Kelly is taking the go-go boots off anytime soon, then you'd best go lean against the wall, flower. Rowland's Guetta-produced new single 'Commander' is pure strobe-light adrenaline rush... will appear on Kelly's as-yet-untitled third solo album... we're predicting a full on Rowland Renaissance!". With Alex Catarinella of Paper saying [...] "she belts out soaring vocals, is further proof that she's no longer the cute teenage girl sharing a chorus." ...|$|E

It turns everything to rubber. Every step you take feels like rubber. It is a lot of fun, I have to say. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on for hours – like eight hours".|$|E
2500|$|Mulga savanna and mulga {{codominant}} tussock grasslands cover roughly 20% of the Australian continent, {{or about}} 1.5 million square kilometres. The mean rainfall {{for much of}} the habitat for A. aneura in Australia is roughly 200–250mm/year, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> to as high as 500mm/year in New South Wales and Queensland. [...] The lowest mean rainfall where it grows is about 50–60mm/year. [...] Both summer and winter rainfall are necessary to maintain mulga, and the species is absent from semiarid regions that experience summer or winter drought.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an earlier}} {{draft of the}} script, the scene where George saves his brother Harry as a child was different. The scene had the boys playing ice hockey on the river (which is on Potter's property) as Potter watches with disdain. George shoots the puck, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> astray and breaks the [...] "No Trespassing" [...] sign and lands in Potter's yard. Potter becomes irate, and the {{gardener}} releases the attack dogs, which causes the boys to flee. Harry falls in the ice, and George saves him with the same results.|$|E

2500|$|In the [...] "Physique Mécanique" [...] {{published}} by Prevost after Le Sage's death, Fatio is mentioned {{in connection with}} the net structure of matter, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on to claim that he (Le Sage) had developed the idea of the net structure already in 1763, before he was in possession of Fatio's original papers. However, according to Zehe's description of the Abauzit manuscript from 1758, this paper contains Fatio's description of the net structure of matter. In the same paper, Le Sage repeated the incorrect claim that Fatio assumed [...] "elastic" [...] collisions – and therefore did not really provide a valid explanation of gravity. Zehe attempted to account for Le Sage's puzzling claims that Fatio assumed [...] "elastic" [...] collisions by speculating that Le Sage must not have studied Fatio's papers very closely.|$|E
2500|$|Though Quan Chi was {{not part}} of the first {{generation}} of Mortal Kombat fighting games, he was the only playable character from the three-dimensional era included in both the storyline and immediate roster of Mortal Kombat (2011), the reboot of the continuity of the first three titles. In the game's story mode, he first appears at the start of the Shaolin Tournament with the resurrected Scorpion serving as his personal assassin. Scorpion has entered the tournament to seek revenge against Sub-Zero, whom he believes slaughtered his family and clan. Raiden, in his effort to prevent Armageddon (as seen in the game's opening sequence), convinces Scorpion not to kill Sub-Zero after defeating him in combat in the Netherealm, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> for naught after Quan Chi manipulates Scorpion into the deed by showing a graphic vision of the Lin Kuei's murder of Scorpion's clan and then his wife and child. He and Scorpion join forces in the tournament to face Liu Kang, but both are defeated. During the second tournament in Shao Kahn's arena in Outworld, Quan Chi refers to himself and Shang Tsung as a [...] "deadly alliance" [...] when they team up to battle Kung Lao (and are beaten). In the retold events of Mortal Kombat 3, he revives the deceased Queen Sindel in order to enable Kahn to invade Earthrealm, in addition to having resurrected Sub-Zero as Noob Saibot, who assists him in his plans. With Quan Chi entrenched as Kahn's second-in-command, Kahn eliminates Shang Tsung and transfers his powers to Sindel, while Quan Chi constructs a Soulnado (a magical twister built from souls trapped in limbo between Earthrealm and Outworld) in a graveyard with the objective of taking every soul on Earth. However, Nightwolf defeats Quan Chi in battle and kicks Noob Saibot into the Soulnado, destroying it, but Quan Chi escapes. After Sindel massacres the Earth warriors who had assembled to stop Kahn's takeover, Raiden seeks cooperation between Earth and the Netherealm and offers Quan Chi their souls as compensation, but Quan Chi has already acquired them, which Raiden then combats and defeats in succession. Quan Chi then inadvertently causes Raiden to have an epiphany when he scoffs at Raiden's claim that the Elder Gods are obligated to prohibit Shao Kahn from taking over Earthrealm; Raiden then realizes that Kahn must merge Earth and Outworld in order to prevent Armageddon, which would in turn force Kahn to face judgment for doing so without victory in Mortal Kombat. When Kahn is finally killed by Raiden in a brutal fight, Earthrealm lies in ruins, and Quan Chi appears at the conclusion with Shinnok, disdainfully picking up the remains of Kahn's helmet while declaring that Shinnok's plan [...] "worked to perfection", which involves Shinnok and Quan Chi spearheading the Netherealm's impending invasion of the weakened Earth and Outworld.|$|E
