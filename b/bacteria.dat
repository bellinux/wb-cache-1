5|$|Archaea and <b>bacteria</b> have {{generally}} similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like <b>bacteria,</b> archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like <b>bacteria,</b> the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive <b>bacteria.</b> Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bacteria</b> like archaea are prokaryotic – unicelluar, {{and having}} no cell nucleus or other membrane-bound organelle. <b>Bacteria</b> are microscopic, {{with a few}} {{extremely}} rare exceptions, such as Thiomargarita namibiensis. <b>Bacteria</b> function and reproduce as individual cells, but they can often aggregate in multicellular colonies. Some species such as myxobacteria can aggregate into complex swarming structures, operating as multicellular groups {{as part of their}} life cycle, or form clusters in bacterial colonies such as E.coli.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bacteria</b> often {{attach to}} {{surfaces}} and form dense aggregations called biofilms, and larger formations known as microbial mats. These biofilms and mats {{can range from}} a few micrometres in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of <b>bacteria,</b> protists and archaea. <b>Bacteria</b> living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of <b>bacteria</b> are bound to surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices, and <b>bacteria</b> protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated <b>bacteria.</b>|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{metabolism}} in <b>bacteria</b> {{is either}} heterotrophic, where organic carbon compounds {{are used as}} carbon sources, or autotrophic, meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide. Heterotrophic <b>bacteria</b> include parasitic types. Typical autotrophic <b>bacteria</b> are phototrophic cyanobacteria, green sulfur-bacteria and some purple <b>bacteria,</b> but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising <b>bacteria.</b> Energy metabolism of <b>bacteria</b> is either based on phototrophy, the use of light through photosynthesis, or based on chemotrophy, the use of chemical substances for energy, which are mostly oxidised {{at the expense of}} oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).|$|E
5|$|Certain <b>bacteria</b> form close spatial {{associations}} {{that are essential}} for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic <b>bacteria</b> that consume organic acids, such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The <b>bacteria</b> in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the <b>bacteria</b> to grow.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil <b>bacteria,</b> such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction of}} the <b>bacteria,</b> sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds to digest the <b>bacteria</b> while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E

5|$|Food-borne {{pathogens}} {{that can}} survive on lettuce include Listeria monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis, which multiplies in storage. However, despite {{high levels of}} <b>bacteria</b> being found on ready-to-eat lettuce products, a 2008 study found no incidences of food-borne illness related to listeriosis, possibly due to the product's short shelf life, indigenous microflora competing with the Listeria <b>bacteria</b> or inhibition of <b>bacteria</b> to cause listeriosis.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{transfer}} between species {{includes the}} formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among <b>bacteria.</b> In medicine, this contributes {{to the spread of}} antibiotic resistance, as when one <b>bacteria</b> acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal transfer of genes from <b>bacteria</b> to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range of genes from <b>bacteria,</b> fungi and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains.|$|E

50|$|A simple example {{involves}} the <b>bacterium</b> Escherichia coli (E. coli), the best understood <b>bacterium.</b> The <b>bacterium</b> is grown on a growth media containing {{two types of}} sugars, {{one of which is}} easier to metabolize than the other (for example glucose and lactose). First, the <b>bacterium</b> will metabolize all the glucose, and grow at a higher speed. Eventually, when all the glucose has been consumed, the <b>bacterium</b> will begin the process of expressing the genes to metabolize the lactose. This will only occur when all glucose in the media has been consumed. For these reasons, diauxic growth occurs in multiple phases.|$|R

5|$|Gram-positive <b>bacteria</b> {{possess a}} thick cell wall {{containing}} {{many layers of}} peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative <b>bacteria</b> have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A {{that is responsible for}} much of the toxicity of gram-negative <b>bacteria.</b> Most <b>bacteria</b> have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive <b>bacteria,</b> respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive <b>bacteria</b> and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of <b>bacteria</b> and is the body's main defence against eye infections.|$|E

By comparison with the flow field of a force dipole and rotlet dipole, we extract the force- dipole and rotlet-dipole strengths for the <b>bacterium</b> and find that counterrotation of the cell body and the flagella is essential for describing the near-field hydrodynamics of the <b>bacterium...</b>|$|R
5000|$|On May 21, 2010, Science {{reported}} that the Venter group had successfully synthesized the genome of the <b>bacterium</b> Mycoplasma mycoides from a computer record, and transplanted the synthesized genome into the existing cell of a Mycoplasma capricolum <b>bacterium</b> that had had its DNA removed. The [...] "synthetic" [...] <b>bacterium</b> was viable, i.e. capable of replicating billions of times.

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the English {{bacteriologist}} Frederick Twort discovered {{a group of}} viruses that infect <b>bacteria,</b> now called bacteriophages (or commonly phages), and the French-Canadian microbiologist Félix d'Herelle described viruses that, when added to <b>bacteria</b> on an agar plate, would produce areas of dead <b>bacteria.</b> He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the <b>bacteria,</b> formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension. Phages were heralded as a potential treatment for diseases such as typhoid and cholera, but their promise was forgotten {{with the development of}} penicillin. The study of phages provided insights into the switching on and off of genes, and a useful mechanism for introducing foreign genes into <b>bacteria.</b>|$|E
5|$|Large-scale gene {{transfer}} has also occurred between {{the ancestors of}} eukaryotic cells and <b>bacteria,</b> during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria.
