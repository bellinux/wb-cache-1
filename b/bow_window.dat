5|$|The east face of {{the eastern}} wing has four bays with canted bay windows, shaped end gables and a central cartouche. In {{the centre of the}} {{northern}} (garden) face is a large <b>bow</b> <b>window,</b> originally Jacobean, which illuminates the chapel; it has stone panels decorated with cartouches below arched stained glass lights. This face otherwise reverses the main façade, with the addition of mezzanine windows.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1881, the Boston & Albany began {{a massive}} {{improvement}} program {{that included the}} building of over 30 new stations along its main line {{as well as the}} Highland Branch, which it bought in 1883. Famed architect H. H. Richardson was hired to design nine of these stations, including South Framingham which was commissioned in October 1883. The $62,718 station, built in 1884–85 by the Norcross Brothers company, was the largest and costliest of the nine. The station {{is a prime example of}} the Richardsonian Romanesque style, built of rough-hewn granite with contrasting details. The dominant roofline, dormers, arched <b>bow</b> <b>window,</b> and wooden interior are typical of the style. Like many of Richardson's designs, the station was well-praised; Henry-Russell Hitchcock called it a [...] "better and somewhat more personal work" [...] in The Architecture of H. H. Richardson and His Time. A small square baggage room was built in the same style just east of the station, near the Concord Street (Route 126) grade crossing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ground floor}} of the west house {{includes}} a shop with a central entrance. [...] On each side are two piers and an 18-light <b>bow</b> <b>window.</b> At the row level is a wooden balustrade, and brackets with carvings similar to the east house. [...] Above this level are eight recessed carved panels. [...] The two centre panels contain the coat of arms of JamesI with an inscription, and the arms of Sodor and Man (George Lloyd was Bishop of Sodor and Man before he became Bishop of Chester) with the date 1615. [...] To the left of these are three panels containing carvings of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, and Abraham and Isaac. [...] To the right are another three panels, two of which contain carvings of biblical scenes. [...] In the storey above are four oak pilasters dividing the windows into three bays, with two mullions and a transom further separating the windows - of {{which there is a}} total of 18. [...] Above the windows is a carved beam and over this are ten arched panels which contain carvings of heraldic beasts. [...] In the attic is a three-light window to each side of which are three panels containing carvings, and above the window are three plain panels. [...] Again the bargeboards are carved with a post between them.|$|E
50|$|After 1858 the 2 drawing {{rooms were}} made into one. Lady Clinton put <b>bow</b> <b>windows</b> {{onto the front}} of the house.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bow</b> <b>windows</b> first {{appeared}} in the eighteenth century in the United Kingdom, (and in the Federal period in the United States).|$|R

6000|$|... "Cyril," [...] {{the little}} wife began again, {{as she took}} over his cup of tea to his easy chair by the <b>bow</b> <b>window,</b> {{and set it down}} quietly on the tiny round table beside him, [...] "where did you go this afternoon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... (While Hagberd speaks, the <b>bow</b> <b>window</b> of the Carvils is lit up, and Bessie is seen {{settling}} {{her father}} in a big armchair. Pulls down blind. Enter Lamplighter. Capt. H. picks up the spade and leans forward on it with both hands; very still, watching him light the lamp.) ...|$|E
60|$|We hurried up {{to where}} he was {{standing}} in a nook, shaped something like a small <b>bow</b> <b>window.</b> Against the wall of this recess were placed three stone chests, each about two feet square. Two were fitted with stone lids, the lid of the third rested {{against the side of the}} chest, which was open.|$|E
2500|$|Urban-type building, {{the facade}} {{displays}} bay <b>windows</b> and <b>bow</b> <b>windows</b> with an inclination to Art Nouveau: round gable top, vegetal motifs, curved cartouches and adorned gate.|$|R
25|$|The {{compositions}} on elevation include <b>bow</b> <b>windows</b> {{topped by}} balconies, loggias plus especially highlighted cartouches and a grand frieze elements deployed like square boards {{on top of}} the facade. Interiors materials are partly original woodwork and stained glass.|$|R
50|$|MSC Opera is an {{identical}} twin to the MSC Lirica. Her other sisters in the class, MSC Armonia and MSC Sinfonia are essentially the same, {{but have a}} smaller funnel and other modifications, such as the <b>bow</b> <b>windows</b> and inside changes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Noah! Noah!" [...] he gasped, {{with a face}} of beetroot, while Lord John and I {{smiled in}} sympathy and Summerlee, like a dyspeptic goat, wagged his head in sardonic disagreement. Finally Challenger, still {{rumbling}} and exploding, began to open his telegrams. The three of us stood in the <b>bow</b> <b>window</b> and occupied ourselves in admiring the magnificent view.|$|E
6000|$|I {{stood in}} a deep <b>bow</b> <b>window</b> with the Baronet, and could not help expressing my wonder. [...] "After all," [...] said I, [...] "there are certain mysteries in our nature, certain inscrutable impulses and influences, that warrant one in being superstitious. Who can account for so many persons of {{different}} characters being thus strangely affected by a mere painting?" ...|$|E
60|$|PARLIAMENT assembled, {{the town}} filled, and every {{moment in the}} day of the Duke of St. James was occupied. Sir Carte and his tribe filled up the morning. Then there were endless visits to endless visitors; dressing; riding, chiefly with Lady Caroline; luncheons, and the <b>bow</b> <b>window</b> at White's. Then came the evening with all its crash and glare; the banquet, the opera, and the ball.|$|E
50|$|Tarranalma {{is a large}} two-storeyed {{house built}} in {{rendered}} brick with a corrugated iron roof. The house is surrounded by 8 feet (2.4 metres) wide verandahs on both floors, which are interrupted by four double-storey projecting bays featuring <b>bow</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
25|$|Most of the {{architectural}} {{details of the}} facade have unfortunately vanished. Be that as it may, one can make out the asymmetry of the elevation, characteristic of Fritz Weidner. He used <b>bow</b> <b>windows</b> unbalanced positions, balconies at different levels and with different shapes to reach his goals.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{structure was}} constructed by Aurelian ca. AD 275 and included a double-arched opening surmounted by <b>bow</b> <b>windows</b> and two semi-cylindrical towers. The façade {{was faced with}} travertine. After a later restoration, the towers were enlarged, increased, and linked, through two parallel walls, to the preexisting Arch of Drusus.|$|R
60|$|Yet, {{within a}} week of Mrs. MacAnder's {{encounter}} in Richmond Park, to all of them--save Timothy, from whom it was carefully kept--to James on his domestic beat from the Poultry to Park Lane, to George the wild one, on his daily adventure from the <b>bow</b> <b>window</b> at the Haversnake to the billiard room at the 'Red Pottle,' was it known that 'those two' had gone to extremes.|$|E
6000|$|The reading-room {{was empty}} except for these two men. Deane {{was sitting in the}} little <b>bow</b> <b>window,</b> looking down with {{apparent}} interest into the narrow, tortuous street. Sarsby, with a pile of torn and crumpled newspapers in front of him, was still standing, leaning over the long table in the centre of the room. His search was finished. He had no doubt whatever in his mind. The murdered man was indeed Ruby's uncle! ...|$|E
60|$|At {{her most}} courteous of invitations, I entered--passing first into a tolerably wide vestibule. Having come mainly to observe, I took notice {{that to my}} right as I stepped in, was a window, {{such as those in}} front of the house; to the left, a door leading into the {{principal}} room; while, opposite me, an open door enabled me to see a small apartment, just the size of the vestibule, arranged as a study, and having a large <b>bow</b> <b>window</b> looking out to the north.|$|E
5000|$|The south part of Bagnoles-de-l'Orne, {{which is}} called [...] "Belle Époque" [...] {{district}} is filled with superb bourgeois villas with polychrome façades, <b>bow</b> <b>windows</b> and unique roofing. This area, built between 1886 and 1914, has an authentic [...] "Bagnolese" [...] style and is typical of high-society country vacation of the time.|$|R
40|$|This image {{shows the}} {{junction}} between the western <b>bow</b> <b>windows</b> of the Board Room or The Mackintosh Room and the staircase that {{was added to}} satisfy fire escape requirements {{in the second phase}} of construction. Instead of removing the windows, Mackintosh chose to install translucent glass and run the stair around them...|$|R
25|$|By 1868 the old two-room {{building}} had been demolished, {{to be replaced}} by the present fifteen-room dressed granite residence of twin gables and <b>bow</b> <b>windows</b> looking over Loch Muick. Between 1866 and 1869 stables and a keeper's cottage and offices were added to the rear. A slipway for boats was built about 1870, between twin jetties.|$|R
60|$|This {{time they}} {{extended}} their distance, stretched out {{as far as}} the river, and explored the adjoining woods; but of Mr. Beckendorff they saw and heard nothing. At length they again returned: it was getting dusk. They found the <b>bow</b> <b>window</b> of the library closed. They again entered the dining-room, and, to their surprise, found no preparations for dinner. This time the Prince was more fortunate in his exertions to procure an interview with Madam Clara, for that lady almost immediately entered the room.|$|E
60|$|There was no {{particular}} reason why, but the incident lingered with me. The sudden raising of the blind, as of the curtain of some small theatre, the barely furnished room coming dimly into view, and the woman standing there, close to the footlights, as to my fancy it seemed. And then the sudden ringing down of the curtain before the play had begun. I turned {{at the corner of}} the street. The blind had been drawn up again, and I saw again the slight, girlish figure silhouetted against the side panes of the <b>bow</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Towers was a {{very large}} house, {{standing}} back amid trees, {{at the head of}} a winding drive. As he drove up the doctor sprang out, paid away half his worldly assets as a fare, and followed a stately footman who, having taken his name, led him through the oak-panelled, stained-glass hall, gorgeous with deers' heads and ancient armour, and ushered him into a large sitting-room beyond. A very irritable-looking, acid-faced man was seated in an armchair by the fireplace, while two young ladies in white were standing together in the <b>bow</b> <b>window</b> at the further end.|$|E
2500|$|John Betjeman admired John Piper's {{illustrations}} for Castles on the Ground, {{describing the}} [...] "fake half-timber, the leaded lights and <b>bow</b> <b>windows</b> of the Englishman's castle" [...] as [...] "the {{beauty of the}} despised, patronised suburb". However, as the historian David Kynaston observed sixty years later, [...] "the time was far from ripe for Metroland nostalgia".|$|R
25|$|In the 20th century, {{residential}} developments {{were built}} on the estate of Frescati, such as Frescati Park. Frescati Park partly incorporated Stable Lane, and the stable-houses were demolished {{to make way for}} it. It was built on woodland around Frescati, and comprised houses with <b>bow</b> <b>windows,</b> mirroring those of Frescati. When Lisalea House was demolished, its lands were incorporated into the Frescati Estate.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} itself {{was designed to}} look and feel like a ship inside. All the offices and passages are made up with <b>bowed</b> <b>windows</b> and light oak finishing. Each floor looks identical to the others except the ground floor which houses the main courtyard with ship-like metallic sails suspended overhead. The courtyard is decorated with trees and two shallow baths of water.|$|R
60|$|Where was {{the waiter}} born? How {{did he come}} here? Has he any hope of getting away from here? Does he ever receive a letter, or take a ride upon the railway, or see {{anything}} but the Dodo? Perhaps he has seen the Berlin Wool. He {{appears to have a}} silent sorrow on him, and it may be that. He clears the table; draws the dingy curtains of the great <b>bow</b> <b>window,</b> which so unwillingly consent to meet, that they must be pinned together; leaves me by the fire with my pint decanter, and a little thin funnel-shaped wine-glass, and a plate of pale biscuits - in themselves engendering desperation.|$|E
60|$|That evening, however, about half-past seven, Charles and I strolled out {{together}} on the King's Road for a blow before dinner. We dine at eight. The air was delicious. We passed a small new hotel, very smart and exclusive, with a big <b>bow</b> <b>window.</b> There, in evening dress, lights burning and blind up, sat our friend, Dr. Polperro, with a lady facing him, young, graceful, and pretty. A bottle of champagne stood open before him. He was helping himself plentifully to hot-house grapes, and full of good humour. It was clear he and the lady were occupied in the intense enjoyment of some capital joke; for they looked queerly at one another, and burst now and again into merry peals of laughter.|$|E
60|$|Gathered at its far end {{where the}} <b>bow</b> <b>window</b> {{overlooked}} the sparkling lake, were {{three or four}} people, all elderly. Instantly one of these riveted his attention. She was stout, having her grey hair drawn back from a massive forehead, beneath which shone piercing black eyes. Her rather ungainly figure was clothed in what he thought an ugly green dress, and she wore a necklet of emeralds in an old-fashioned setting, which he also thought ugly but striking. From the moment that he entered the doorway {{at the far end}} of that long saloon, he felt those black eyes fixed upon him, and was painfully aware of their owner's presence, so much so, that in a whisper, he asked her name of Miss Ogilvy.|$|E

5000|$|The {{distinctive}} <b>bow</b> <b>windows</b> provide {{light into}} the building's interior spaces, and {{the combination of a}} granite facade for the lower floors and brick facade for the upper stories helps lighten the load placed on the internal steel framework.

60|$|The best {{windows for}} outlook are, of course, oriels and <b>bow</b> <b>windows,</b> {{but these are}} not to be {{considered}} under the head of apertures merely; they are either balconies roofed and glazed, and to be considered under the head of external appliances, or they are each a story of an external semi-tower, having true aperture windows on each side of it.|$|R
