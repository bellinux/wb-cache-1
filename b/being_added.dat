5|$|Expansion of {{the system}} {{continued}} until 1956, when the Interstate Highway System was formed. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate system, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still <b>being</b> <b>added.</b>|$|E

50|$|Conventionally, {{the fourth}} is third in {{importance}} to the root, fifth, and third, <b>being</b> an <b>added</b> tone. It may be avoided as the root since that inversion may resembles a ninth chord on the fourth rather than a suspended chord on the original note. In jazz chords and theory, the fourth is required due to its <b>being</b> an <b>added</b> tone.|$|R
5|$|The South Shore Line, an {{electric}} commuter railroad, connects the South Bend International Airport to Millennium Station in downtown Chicago. Due to increased ridership since 2005 between Chicago and South Bend, more cars are <b>being</b> <b>added.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the entire}} album was {{recorded}} and played by Anderson, {{the only option}} was to record the music in layers. First, he recorded the drums, using a drum kit. However, he was unhappy with the way they sounded, and so re-recorded on a drum machine. The next layers to be recorded were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds <b>being</b> <b>added</b> later.|$|E
5|$|By 1946, the Canby-Oregon portion {{had been}} marked as Sign Route 139, {{connecting}} with Oregon Route 39; it was extended south over US 299 to Adin and Routes 216 and 20 to Susanville by 1960. The number was legislatively adopted, replacing Routes 210 and 216, in the 1964 renumbering. It {{has remained a}} two-lane road, despite <b>being</b> <b>added</b> to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 (Canby to Oregon) and 1965 (Susanville to Adin).|$|E

5|$|Expansion on {{the campus}} {{continued}} rapidly, with new buildings, institutes and expansions <b>being</b> <b>added</b> nearly every year. But by the late 1970s, the university faced a crisis. During its fast expansion, it relied on draft bylaws, mostly borrowed from the University of São Paulo, and lacked formal internal regulations with the aging Zeferino Vaz, while no longer the rector, acting as a moderating force between parties with conflicting interests, in particular the leftist academic community and the State's government, appointed by the conservative military regime ruling the country.|$|E
5|$|Governor Lane {{kept the}} legal {{code of the}} {{dissolved}} provisional government, only immediately repealing the law authorizing the minting of the Beaver Coins, as this was incompatible with the United States Constitution (Article I, Section 8). The creation of the Washington Territory in 1854 removed the northern half of the Oregon Territory. Established on 14 February 1859, the state of Oregon was composed roughly the western half the territory, the remaining eastern section <b>being</b> <b>added</b> to the Washington Territory.|$|E

Mary Calvert, a community relations adviser, was also appointed. Bringing a new perspective, Mary encouraged the involvement of local school children, opening the [...] "Cougar Classroom" [...] and launching initiatives such as drugs education.|$|R
5|$|SR163 was {{established}} during the 1964 highway renumbering, extending from Sumner to Auburn. The highway was previously {{a part of}} the Pacific Highway during the early 20th century, but was designated as a branch of State Road5 and Primary State Highway5 (PSH5) until 1964. SR163 became SR167 during the late 1960s and was moved to Pearl Street in 1991, with the ferry route <b>being</b> <b>added</b> in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Service on the Orange Line {{began on}} November 20, 1978 between National Airport and New Carrollton, with five new {{stations}} <b>being</b> <b>added</b> {{to the existing}} network from Stadium–Armory. When the line from Rosslyn to Ballston–MU was completed on December 11, 1979, Orange Line trains began following this route rather than going to the National Airport station. The line was completed on June 7, 1986, when it was extended by four stations to Vienna in the I-66 median.|$|E
5|$|The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) lists 2,180 higher {{education}} institutions, 607 {{of which are}} public and 1,573 private. Classes start in June and end in March.

5|$|The Nathaniel Backus House's {{construction}} date is unknown, but it {{is believed}} to have been around 1750. The History of Norwich, Connecticut places it around 1734 and makes mention of a highway <b>being</b> <b>added</b> in 1750 specifically by Nathaniel Backus' house.

5|$|The Town Hall {{was built}} in 1778, with the porch and arcade <b>being</b> <b>added</b> in 1861 and the balcony and round windows in 1932. It is a Grade II listed building.

The building also houses the magistrates courts and other offices. The Assize court last sat here in October 1970.|$|E
5|$|The {{designation}} WS-199B {{was assigned}} to the project that, under a contract awarded in 1958 to Martin Aircraft, would become the Bold Orion missile. The design of Bold Orion was simple, using parts developed for other missile systems to reduce the cost and development time of the project. The initial Bold Orion configuration was a single-stage vehicle, using a Thiokol TX-20 Sergeant solid-fuel rocket. Following initial testing, the Bold Orion configuration was altered to become a two-stage vehicle, an Allegany Ballistics Laboratory Altair upper stage <b>being</b> <b>added</b> to the missile.|$|E

Golf (after <b>being</b> <b>added</b> to the Olympic program for 2016) also made its Pan American Games debut. Canoe slalom, the only Olympic discipline never to have been held at the Games, also made its debut, meaning {{for the first time}} the entire Olympic sports program was contested. Furthermore, both canoe disciplines had C-1 events for women for the first time. Women's baseball and women's rugby sevens also made their debuts, with men's softball returning to the program, after last being contested in 2003. A total of 19 sports (the most ever) were direct or indirect (such as opportunities to gain qualification times) qualifiers for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
5|$|In games {{subject to}} time control, a chess clock is used, {{consisting}} of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be analog or digital though a digital clock is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either a time delay (a countdown to when a clock starts again) or add (extra time <b>being</b> <b>added</b> prior or after the move) to their time controls. Before {{the start of the}} game, either the arbiter decides, or whomever is playing Black, where the chess clock is placed.|$|E
