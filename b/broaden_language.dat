The t-test and Mann-Whitney U statistical tests applied to assorted data revealed significant differences in the distribution of instructors’ and Iranian language students’ perceptions of collegiate writing regarding the nature of writing, attention paid to writing factors by instructors, and acquiring writing competence. Turing to writing goals, several Chi-Square tests suggested an existing tension between critical facets of instructors’ and students’ writing goals, namely objects of goals, actions taken, and responsibility.

40|$|This paper derives its impetus {{from the}} {{consensus}} {{today that the}} media play an indispensable role indemocratic governance for sustained development. The media foster, most importantly, accountability,transparency, rule of law, respect for human rights, and civic participation, which are vital in securing theeconomic well-being of a people. Language, as the main vehicle that drives communication or journalisticimperatives to the “consumer”, thus becomes a critical factor. The focus here is on the effective and appropriate use of English (Ghana’s official language) innewspapers in Ghana. It is argued {{that the majority of}} newspapers display linguistic ineptitude, therebyweakening their capacity to package and make development-oriented messages accessible to the reader. Specifically, the majority of newspapers present news in grammatically faulty and semantically confusingconstructions that blur meaning. Thus, through a comparative study of the English and English-relatedcourses in four journalism training institutions in Ghana and the English provisions in the latest UNESCOjournalism curricula for Africa (2007), the study shows that English competence appears to be taken forgranted in the training institutions. This paper therefore argues for journalism education in Ghana to focus on helping trainee journalists toacquire English language competency. A more worthwhile complement will be to de-emphasise the“core” journalism or media knowledge and skills students are made to focus all their attention on in theschools and rather emphasise English use and usage. The paper suggests a reorganisation of Englishstudies including institutional structure, curriculum and syllabus development, infrastructure, teaching,and learning methodology as ways of <b>broadening</b> English <b>language</b> pedagogy to produce the calibre ofjournalists who can really champion the democratic and developmental aspirations of Ghana and Africa...|$|R

Cooperation was fundamentally a response to the new structural and curricular differentiation of modern secondary and higher education, which in turn reflected the specialization of knowledge and work in urban industrial society. Its theory shaped by organicist social thought, its practice by scientific management, the movement influenced writing instruction not only in comprehensive secondary schools and universities, but also in vocational, technical, and professional schools, in settlement houses, and in adult extension classes (particularly those for immigrants).

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{will develop a}} social science {{perspective}} {{on the construction of}} sign language corpora for digital humanities scholarship. At this point in time sign language corpora are emergent, although sign language repositories (some including metadata standardised for sign languages) do already exist. What content to include in language corpora is generally discussed with respect to the issues of representativeness and size, the available resources, the scope for comparison with existing datasets, and the linguistic reasons for building a corpus. Issues in the construction and management of language corpora are therefore mainly points of discussion within linguistic circles. This paper aims to broaden the context of language corpus creation, by taking as a starting point not corpus linguistics, but digital humanities—defined as the inclusive study of dynamic interaction between people, their heritage, institutions, and new technology. This conceptual <b>broadening</b> of a <b>language</b> corpus to include the ceaseless making and remaking of digital artefacts by users and reproducers calls for methodical attention to the nature of corpus creation as ongoing cultural performance.

40|$|The Kenyan coast, already linguistically super-diverse, has {{witnessed}} {{the emergence of}} a new coastal language practice, 'Coasti Slang', which arose under conditions of 'partial acquisition' (cf. Lipski, 2002) of German as a Swahili-based genderized style among male multilingual sex workers. It was later adopted by others, who began to manipulate this language variety and expand their repertoires, turning the new style into a business language spoken along the waterfront. As it is currently used, Coasti Slang allows 'beach boys', beach vendors, hotel workers, sex workers and fishermen to deliberately conceal certain aspects of their communications for business purposes while integrating acquired terms from tourist languages (e. g., German, French, Italian) into this new fluid practice. Words from coastal Bantu languages have also entered the <b>language,</b> <b>broadening</b> the community of practice. Today, this language practice draws on speakers' indexical linguistic biographies, reflecting globalized creativity. Coasti Slang is thus neither a youth language nor merely a secret language, but a mobile and fluid practice that involves linguistic manipulation, originally linked to the gendered performance of linguistic masculinity among 'beach boys', and from then on increasingly used in coastal petty trade. The present paper is the first to shed light on the use of linguistic strategies in Coasti Slang, speakers' acquisition patterns and repertoires, the surrounding linguistic landscapes along the Kenyan coast, and the continued spread of this variety among speakers of all genders and professions...|$|R

This shift has recently influenced our Newfoundland and Labrador curriculum, largely through the efforts of the Atlantic Provinces Education Foundation (APEF). APEF directions are based on the changes advocated by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), primarily in the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics (1989). [...] Teachers in Newfoundland and Labrador are currently in transition with their teaching roles in delivering the new mathematics curriculum. This project, designed for elementary teachers, addresses the teaching of multiplication of whole numbers in the APEF curriculum. Specifically, the project explores alternate algorithms and examines procedural and conceptual understanding in the teaching of multiplication in today's elementary classroom. In particular, changing conceptions of what matters for students to learn demand increased attention to alternate forms of task presentation and student response: oral, written, and model. Expectations of students' conceptual knowledge are <b>broadened</b> to consider <b>language</b> and number sense. Potential changes in assessment, reflecting the advocated shift, are then offered. Finally, an extensive list of sample tasks, pertinent to multiplication of whole numbers, is made available. It is the intention that this project will serve not only as positive food for thought in a changing conceptualization of teaching mathematics in general, but also as a resource for teachers of grades four to six, and perhaps at either side of this indicated range, in teaching the multiplication of whole numbers in the new APEF Mathematics Curriculum...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study titled ‘The Impact of Multimodal Texts on the Development of English language proficiency’ is conceived from three problem statements: (a) Is the Communicative English One (CE 1) course effective? (b) Is {{the use of}} multimodal technologies useful? and (c) Is it useful to have knowledge about students’ learning needs {{in the design of}} a course, as well as taking cognisance of their needs in the planning? The CE 1 course guided this {{research study}}. A sample of 400 students was drawn {{out of a total of}} 1300. Students’ English language proficiency was assessed before they started the course, at the end of the course and three months after they had completed the course. An English Proficiency Test (EPT) was administered on three occasions to assess change in performance with respect to learning English. Information about students’ background characteristics, in addition to the processes involved in the course and those related to the course was collected. The English Proficiency Test was used to assess the students’ performance on the course and the data were analysed with Partial Least Squares Path Analysis to examine the mediating effects that influenced outcomes. Hierarchical Linear Modelling was used to examine the moderating effects that influenced the outcomes. Thirteen students were also interviewed to obtain an indepth perspective of the situation. Students’ written responses to open-ended questions were also analysed. The key findings are: (a) multimodal technologies are effective in English language learning, (b) there is a gain in performance of students who enrolled for the CE 1 course with low English proficiency, (c) while the girls do not lose, the boys increase noticeably in performance, (d) students from the East Coast region do not progress as rapidly as other regions, (e) students in some faculties gain more than students in other faculties and (f) there are faculty differences in the benefits obtained from the course. The implication of this research study to the theory of language learning is that multimodal technology increases the informal learning of English as both a second and foreign language alongside formal instruction in the classroom. Thus the use of technology can supplement the learning of a second and a foreign language in ways similar to the learning that takes place within the community in second language learning. This research study indicates that there are important benefits from the application of multimodal technologies that can be used for foreign language learning as well as for <b>broadening</b> second <b>language</b> learning.

Musicians who are adept at the production and perception of music are also more sensitive to key acoustic features of speech such as voice onset timing and pitch. Together, {{these data suggest that}} musical training may enhance the processing of acoustic information for speech sounds. In the current study, we sought to provide neural evidence that musicians process speech and music in a similar way. We hypothesized that for musicians, right hemisphere areas traditionally associated with music are also engaged for the processing of speech sounds. In contrast we predicted that in non-musicians processing of speech sounds would be localized to traditional left hemisphere language areas. Speech stimuli differing in voice onset time was presented using a dichotic listening paradigm. Subjects either indicated aural location for a specified speech sound or identified a specific speech sound from a directed aural location. Musical training effects and organization of acoustic features were reflected by activity in source generators of the P 50. This included greater activation of right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) in musicians. The findings demonstrate recruitment of right hemisphere in musicians for discriminating speech sounds and a putative <b>broadening</b> of their <b>language</b> network.

This accounts for the significance of this research which aims to deduce the linguistic significance of understanding the Quranic texts. This poetic interpretation was chosen for being a manuscript interpreting the Quran in a systematic poetic style by one of the Muslim scholars for a book with various sciences in its interpretation. According to the descriptive methodology of this study, the material is presented and studied followed by the analytic study of the linguistic issues in the manuscript. This study investigates the linguistic issues in the first chapter of Al- Fatiha and thirty verses from the second chapter of Al- Baqara of the manuscript followed by analyzing the linguistic texts with respect to significant sources and works in this regard. The research comes with an introduction, seven chapters and a conclusion. The study finds out that Al-Ghizi uses a word and its morphology after explaining its meaning in the Quranic verse. He sometimes mentions variant opinions of interpreters and linguists on the verse and agrees with them at times, and argues against them at other times. He cares for each word, its type, root and rhyme. In his discussion, Al- Ghizi does not stop at one interpretation but dwells on the various probable perspectives, thereby enriching the <b>language,</b> <b>broadening</b> the horizons and conveying other meanings the expressions could bear without committing the mind to a single meaning only.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} research study attempts to investigate innovation in general English language teaching/learning {{as perceived by}} English teachers at a private vocational junior college in Taiwan, a Chinese-speaking context. The underachievement {{reported in the literature}} highlights the important issue that innovation is always constrained by many factors at all levels, in terms of institutional, educational, and cultural levels, etc. (Kennedy 1988). Recently research on innovation has been moving from a method-oriented understanding to <b>broadening</b> perspectives beyond <b>language</b> and classroom (Holliday 1996). In this context, this research aims to identify the mechanisms of three ELT innovation projects and investigate the factors affecting their success on many levels. The method adopted was ethnographic research that gave a thick description of how the teachers participated in the ELT projects leading to innovation. The three ELT projects to be examined were carried out on a school basis and located in the same context. One was initiated entirely top-down, one from both directions, and the other bottom-up. The first one aimed to implement a new teacher role of teacher-cum-researcher, the second to integrate technology into the English program, and the last to improve teaching through better materials. These projects were non-aided and independent of expatriates, and in this way different from the expatriate-aided ELT projects in the literature. Besides, unlike many projects that are designed and evaluated by their change agents, these projects were examined {{from the perspective of the}} end users (teachers), and in this way provide insights from a different angle. Several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the outcomes. It is found that the rise of the double centre-periphery innovation model in the field of education was ineffective in helping under-informed implementers to develop their change capacity. Dalin's four barriers (1983) are inadequate to address the barriers to innovation effectiveness, without taking the communication barrier and local negative rhythms into account, as they also inhibited the success of innovation. This study also shows that it seems naYve to expect that success is more likely in bottom-up innovations than in top-down innovations. In fact, if innovations, whether top-down or bottom-up, are to succeed, they require the same favourable conditions to facilitate their success, such as the development of the change capacity and effective conflict management.

An introduction ti the Anglo-Norse linguistic background and a brief survey og language change and Norse linguistic influence on English have been included so as to view the current trends in relation {{to the development of the}} Anglo-Norse linguistic relationship. A consideration of aspects of the present state of morphology and an assesment of Norwegian approaches to maintaining linguistic purity under the influence of the English <b>language</b> <b>broaden</b> the linguistic scope. From the survey results arose a discussion of the state of the Norwegian orthopraphy and of the teaching of grammar and orthography in Norway. The investigation shows that the uncertainty in the three areas of morphology is not solely caused by `the English illness`. To a much greater degree the main concern is the state of knowledge of Norwegian orthopraphy and morphology. In particular, the present approach to the teaching of Norwegian orthopraphy and morphology has been found to be the main cause of uneas. The view is held by a majority of the informants that the importance of orthography competence is not promoted in education in Norway, which thus seriously undermines Norwegian speakers´knowledge of their vernacular...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo ancora-se na abordagem bilíngüe para explorar e abordar as esferas simbólicas da linguagem - gesto, desenho, narrativa e escrita - concomitante à língua de sinais no desenvolvimento de linguagem da criança surda e na construção de novos conhecimentos. A partir do referencial de análise qualitativa foram utilizados os construtos teóricos e metodológicos da perspectiva Histórico-Cultural e de sua articulação com a análise microgenética. Os sujeitos da pesquisa foram duas crianças surdas bilíngües, em fase de aquisição tanto da língua de sinais, quanto da escrita da língua portuguesa, cursando a 2 ª série do Ensino Fundamental. Ambas eram do sexo masculino, na faixa etária de 9 e 10 anos, e diagnóstico audiológico de surdez profunda bilateral. O foco das análises privilegiou a emergência dos processos em mudança na dinâmica das interações entre os sujeitos que participaram da pesquisa, considerando o aspecto {{particular}} e global na sua ocorrência e constituição. As atividades simbólicas favoreceram a ampliação da língua de sinais e acessos iniciais à escrita, abrindo espaço para a consolidação de signos e para o desenvolvimento de linguagem. O uso prioritário da língua de sinais, associado ao trabalho com atividades sígnicas, além da consideração das particularidades lingüísticas e das mediações semióticas, foram fundamentais para o desenvolvimento da linguagem da criança surda e para a construção de conhecimentos, de maneira satisfatória e adequada à sua constituição como sujeito ativo e participante da linguagem. This {{study is}} grounded on a bilingual approach and {{it aims to}} explore and to approach the symbolic spheres of language - gesture, drawing, narrative and writing - concomitantly to sign language in deaf children's language development and to the building of new knowledge. Theoretical and methodological constructs stemming from the Historic-Cultural perspective and its articulation with the microgenetic analysis were used in this qualitative analysis. Research subjects were two deaf boys {{who were in the}} process of bilingual language acquisition - Brazilian sign language and the written modality of Brazilian Portuguese; both were in the second grade of Brazilian elementary education level, with ages between 9 and 10 years and both had audiological diagnoses of profound bilateral deafness. The focus of the analysis highlighted the emergence of changing processes in the dynamics of interactions between the research subjects, taking into account the particular and global aspects in their occurrence and constitution. Symbolic activities enable the <b>broadening</b> of sign <b>language</b> and beginning access to writing, which in turn promote the consolidation of signing and language development. The priority given to sign language use associated with working with semiotic activities which take into account linguistic particularities and semiotic mediations were vital for language development of these deaf children and for the construction of knowledge, in a way that is both satisfactory and adequate to their constitution as active subjects and participants in language...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project {{is concerned with}} jewellery as portrait. The portraits created are not mimetic nor do they necessarily refer to a specific model but are created to produce an effect upon the wearer and viewer. This effect is intended to rupture conventional ideas of portraiture. The portraits created are not what they seem and are linked to contemporary arts theory and practice in that they address pressing concerns: questions of subjectivity, portraiture, appearance and jewellery. Portraits in the twenty first century are diverse and can range from the most abstract representation to detailed life like, mirror images. They can be self-portraits, representations of once living or living person's, refer back to historical art practice and master paintings, or they can he constructed in {{the imagination of the}} artist, real or fictional. The portrait is at the forefront of exploring ideas of self in contemporary arts practice and has a multitude of possibilities, but always they emphasize the human presence and narrative. The aim has been to create jewellery that draws from the Surrealist technique of automatism, James Ensor and masks. Firstly, automatic drawing (specifically automatic drawing as a way to re-interpret portraiture) is examined in this studio based practice by creating wire faces which are produced in a manner that references Surrealist practices. Secondly, the work of James Ensor and others is examined in order to define how artists {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century's had considerable impact on conventional portraiture and the place of the mask to this end. Thirdly, masks are investigated because of the way artists used them to help dismantle portraiture in the twentieth century and the use of the mask freed them from the constraints of realism and <b>broadened</b> artistic <b>language.</b> Finally, Freud's notion of the unconscious is introduced as part of portraiture and jewellery. The Surrealist technique of automatic drawing, the mask, the theory of the unconscious and the art of James Ensor all disrupt the traditional ideal of the portrait as a "realistic" representation of the sitter/model, presents the self as multiple and a performance that is disrupted by the unconscious. In this project, this shift is examined through theories of the self and the response of art theory and practice to these ideas. Prior to the advent of the twentieth century, the self was basically considered as a something that could be worked upon. In other words, individuals could consciously work towards developing themselves to a particular end; better person, more moral, kinder and so on. This was, and often remains, the basic tenet of education and self-help programs. In terms of portraiture, the image could be a mirror image of the sitter/model or a representation of what the sitter/model thought of themselves: heroic, beautiful, young. Either way, the aim was to capture the sitter in a moment for perpetuity. However, this view of the self as the result of a conscious program was challenged: firstly by the work of Freud in the early twentieth century, and later by continental philosophy. In particular, Freud's notion of the unconscious contributed to a different understanding of the self. This idea had profound effects upon art theory and practice, including that of portraiture. The aim of this current project is to consider this notion in relation to more contemporary beliefs of the self and to develop a practice of making portraits as jewellery objects that seek to reference the unconscious in order to contribute to the displacement of the ideal that the self is the end product of a conscious effort. This aim is intrinsically ethical as it allows for the disruption that the repressed causes. It also promises to develop jewellery objects that while ostensibly portraits, make reference to the repressed content of the sitter/model. The mask has been chosen as a marker of this type of event not only because masks are traditionally changeable and offer a disguise but, because of their relationship to the unconscious. The mask shows us that we are bound by psychological and social constraints: by the masks of convention. This research is linked to contemporary arts practice by continuing to explore complex and evolving issues of self. It investigates the human face and its artistic rendering which remains central to contemporary arts practice. Finally the work that is created is discussed and the journey that has been charted and the influences that initiated the work to the current position. The conclusion, in defining the work, finds the links between the series and points to possible future directions...|$|R
40|$|Across {{international}} boundaries, {{linguistic and}} cultural diversity among pupils present teachers with pedagogic challenges. Research on teachers’ perceptions (e. g. Pajares, 1992; Woods, 1996; Farrell, 2005) suggests that the beliefs that teachers hold impact significantly on their classroom practices. This study adds to the existing body of international literature on teacher beliefs and literacy practices by exploring teachers’ perceptions about the reading literacy needs of EAL pupils and how these were met in Scottish secondary mainstream classroom contexts. In Scotland, policy specifies a Framework for Inclusion where pupils learning English as an additional language (hereafter EAL) are placed in mainstream classrooms. Schools are encouraged to {{play a key role}} in making sure that the needs of such pupils are addressed in an effort to raise achievement. A sociocultural theoretical lens was used to examine the shared and divergent beliefs and reading literacy practices of sixteen mainstream English teachers; five EAL teachers; and five head/depute head teachers across three local authorities. Participants’ responses communicated an undifferentiated understanding of the distinctive reading literacy needs of EAL pupils. The majority of teachers foregrounded reading as a set of universal skills that emphasised a knowledge of vocabulary and grammar. Ill-fitting policies and teachers’ experiences within the varying school contexts appeared to mediate how EAL pupils’ needs were constructed. Findings concerning the beliefs and practices of these teachers revealed that there was a lack of available ways of thinking about how to meet the reading literacy needs of EAL pupils effectively; such a lack impacted on the quality and number of learning opportunities EAL pupils had as they faced the reading literacy demands of mainstream classrooms. Teachers also highlighted their uncertainty about how to meet the reading literacy needs of such pupils effectively and this seemed to impact on how they constructed their identities as teachers within linguistically and culturally diverse classroom settings. In contrast, an overview of classroom literacy practices revealed that teachers enacted confident identities as they operated out of a secure knowledge base for developing reading literacy in monolingual English speaking classrooms. The study concludes with a discussion of the limitations related to the research design, and outlines the implications of the findings for policy, classroom literacy practices, and teachers’ professional development opportunities. It is argued that Scottish schools are no longer monolingual, monocultural environments, but rather cross-cultural sites. It is recommended that policy needs to reconceptualise and <b>broaden</b> how second <b>language</b> development is framed within its documents. It is also suggested that secondary classroom contexts address the importance of multidimensional critical literacy practices as a way to challenge the dominant undifferentiated constructions that permeate teachers’ beliefs about the development of reading literacy for pupils learning EAL. Such changes would position EAL pupils as legitimate participants in classroom literacy practices. The thesis concludes with a consideration of teacher identity and emphasises the need of ITE providers to provide a continuum of provision for pre-service and in-service teachers to enable them to develop the necessary knowledge and practices that would support the growing numbers of pupils learning EAL...|$|R
