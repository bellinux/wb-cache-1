5|$|In rare cases, a {{plant species}} {{may only be}} {{effectively}} pollinated by a single bee species, and some plants are endangered {{at least in part}} because their pollinator is also threatened. There is, however, a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators. There are some forty oligoleges associated with the creosote <b>bush</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arid parts of the United States southwest, for example.|$|E

5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated {{to run for}} {{president}} in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign for Pat Buchanan. That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the Republican Party and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran {{for president}} again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E

5|$|Historian Keith W. Olson {{has written}} that Nixon left a {{negative}} legacy: fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate. During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct had been comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious {{than those of the}} incumbent. Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease {{in the power of the}} presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate. Olson suggests that grants of power to George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of the 9/11 attacks restored the president's power.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with other results, this 12 percentage point margin was smaller than Gore's 25 point margin over <b>Bush</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state Presidential contest, was slightly larger than the 10 point margin by which fellow New York senator Charles Schumer defeated incumbent Republican Al D'Amato in the hotly contested 1998 race, but was considerably smaller than the 47 point margin by which Senator Schumer won reelection in 2004 against little-known Republican challenger Howard Mills. The victory of a Democrat in the Senate election was not assured, {{because in recent decades}} the Republicans had won about half the elections for governor and senator.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Lincoln Memorial, other Washington, D.C. landmarks visited include the Jefferson Memorial, the Watergate Hotel (where the family stays), the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the White House, the National Air and Space Museum, and the Washington Monument. When the family visits the White House, they encounter then-First Lady Barbara <b>Bush</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bathtub {{of one of the}} many bathrooms. Another American landmark mentioned in the episode is Mount Rushmore. The scene mentioning that landmark could imply that Springfield is Springfield, South Dakota since Mount Rushmore is in South Dakota. In addition, Lisa proposes that the family attend the memorial of the fictional Winifred Beecher Howe, an early crusader for women's rights who later appeared on the unpopular 75-cent coins according to Lisa. This is a reference to the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin, which was only minted for three years and never became popular.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low voter turnout. Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout. The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout. Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presidential election against John Kerry in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies' offense {{benefited from}} rest {{due to the}} {{postponement}} of {{the final game of}} the Padres' series, as they defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the opener of their mid-week series, 11–4. The next two games did not go as smoothly, as the Phillies were shut out through eight innings in the second game and nearly no-hit by Brewers starter Dave <b>Bush</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third game. Phillies starter Cole Hamels was hit by a line drive in the fourth inning and exited the game; before departing, he had retired nine out of the ten batters he faced. Hitting the road for a series against the division-leading Florida Marlins, the Phillies were shut out through eight innings in {{the first game of the}} series, only to score seven runs in the top of the ninth against power-throwing closer Matt Lindstrom, winning the game, 7–3, thanks to Shane Victorino's first career regular season grand slam. The following night's game offered another come-from-behind win for the Phillies, as they trailed in the ninth again to win in extra innings, 6–4, and the 13–2 victory on April 26 capped the team's first series sweep. Hosting Washington for their second series against the Nationals, the Phillies fell behind in the seventh inning before a grand slam by Ibáñez capped their 13–11 victory; combined with Ryan Howard's game-tying grand slam in the fifth inning, this was only the fourth time in Phillies history that teammates hit grand slams in the same game. The Phillies split the remaining two games of the series with Washington, finishing with an April record of 11–9, their second consecutive winning April.|$|E
