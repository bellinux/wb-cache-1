40|$|In particular, {{this report}} {{identifies}} specific policy decisions that caused state agency FY 2003 <b>budgets</b> to <b>be</b> {{above or below}} what can {{be accounted for by}} inflation and population growth. The <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> a policy document that reflects priorities. By studying changes in the <b>budget,</b> one <b>is</b> able to pinpoint changes in policy priorities. To get at the effect of policy changes on the <b>budget,</b> it <b>is</b> necessary to define a "Baseline" budget. A Baseline <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> defined as a budget that reflects inflation and population growth (i. e., would maintain constant real per capita spending). In other words, a Baseline <b>budget</b> <b>is</b> one that grows as fast as the increase in the cost of living and the increase in the population being served. Thus, in this report, we identify specific policy decisions that caused state agency general fund <b>budgets</b> to <b>be</b> above or below the Baseline.
