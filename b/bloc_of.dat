5|$|In 1957, Malaya {{received}} {{its independence from}} Britain {{as part of their}} decolonisation process in that region. The British government, in their reorganisation of the region following their departure, sought to combine Malaya with Singapore and the states of Sarawak, North Borneo, and Brunei to form a new 'Malaysian Federation.' This would serve British interests in these regions, particularly military basing rights, which they hoped the Malaysians would protect. Indonesia, however, and in particular President Sukarno, was fiercely opposed to such a project. Sukarno, who was leaning ever closer towards the Communist <b>bloc</b> <b>of</b> China and Russia, despised the 'imperialist' British, and had planned to incorporate the latter three regions, all of which are located on the northern tip of Borneo, with the Indonesian-controlled territory of Kalimantan, which makes up the vast majority of that island. Sukarno determined to begin a military Confrontation with Malaysia, which through a series of raids and supported revolts might improve Indonesia's position in negotiating for the island.|$|E

40|$|This paper builds upon Feenstra (2002) {{to obtain}} {{consistent}} estimates of trade effects <b>of</b> regional <b>blocs</b> by adding bilateral effects to the gravity equation and analyzing its variation across <b>blocs</b> <b>of</b> different intensity. The results are then compared across different gravity equations {{used in the}} literature only to observe significant variation in sign, magnitude, and significance. The consequent equation shows that the effect is positive for economics cooperation agreements and preferential trade agreements, but free-trade agreements {{do not have a}} significant incremental effect. While customs unions have a positive incremental effect over <b>blocs</b> <b>of</b> lower intensity, the incremental effect is mixed for monetary unions, and negative for economic areas and full integrations. Furthermore, the effect varies with the duration and degree of implementation as well as the coverage <b>of</b> <b>blocs.</b> Lastly, changes in trade effects <b>of</b> the European <b>blocs</b> across time observed and policy implications are discussed.
