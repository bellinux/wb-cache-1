25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{there was an}} {{international}} outcry about dog meat consumption in the Philippines after newspapers published photos of Margaret Thatcher, then British Prime Minister, with a dog carcass hanging <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> a market stall. The British Government discussed withdrawing foreign aid and other countries, such as Australia, considered similar action. To avoid such action, the Filipino government banned the sale of dog meat, despite dog meat being the third most consumed meat, behind pork and goat and ahead of beef. The ban eventually became totally disregarded, although it was reinstated by President Ramos in 1998 in the Animal Welfare Act (Republic Act 8485).|$|E

Her body was found face-up near the two beds where she slept, roughly [...] away from a hole that her assailant(s) had apparently cut in the wall of the cabin. Wayne Richard McGuire, Fossey's last research assistant at Karisoke, was summoned to the scene by Fossey's house servant and found her bludgeoned to death, reporting that [...] "when I reached down to check her vital signs, I saw her face had been split, diagonally, with one machete blow." [...] The cabin was littered with broken glass and overturned furniture, with a 9-mm handgun and ammunition <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> the floor. Robbery was not believed to be the motive for the crime, as Fossey's valuables were still in the cabin, including her passport, handguns, and thousands of dollars in U.S. bills and traveler's checks.|$|E
