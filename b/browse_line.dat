50|$|Quercus kelloggii {{typically}} grows from 9 - 25 m {{in height}} and from 0.3 - 1.4 m in diameter. Large trees may exceed 36 m in height and 1.6 m diameter. The species also grows in shrubby scrub-oak form on poor sites. In open areas the crown is broad and rounded, with lower branches nearly touching {{the ground or}} forming a <b>browse</b> <b>line.</b> In closed stands, the crown is narrow and slender in young trees and irregularly broad in old trees. Trunks are usually free of branches on the lower 6 - 12 m in closed stands. Trunks are often forked, and usually decayed and hollow in older trees. The bark is thin and smooth in young trees, becoming thick, ridged, and plate-like with age.

40|$|Blue oaks (Quercus douglasii) are not {{regenerating}} {{well over}} much of California. The roles of fire and browsing in regeneration are probably significant, but poorly understood. We burned two foothill blue oak woodland sites which contained significant numbers of small trees between 40 and 70 cm tall, then compared height growth over 14 years among 48 trees that were: a) unburned and unbrowsed, b) unburned but browsed, c) burned and browsed, and d) burned and unbrowsed. Fire completely killed and/or removed the tops, but all plants subsequently resprouted, creating an even-aged stem class. We {{found no evidence that}} fire stimulated regeneration. Protection from moderate browsing pressure by deer and cattle (approximately 75 - 80 percent of twigs to a height of 150 cm were browsed) favored regrowth and subsequent escape above the <b>browse</b> <b>line,</b> although some browsed plants also reached or exceeded browse height. Height growth differed significantly by site. On one site 11 of 12 unbrowsed plants had escaped to above the <b>browse</b> <b>line,</b> with several over 3 meters tall. On the other site growth was slower, but 9 of 11 surviving unbrowsed plants were above the <b>browse</b> <b>line.</b> Fourteen years after fire enough blue oaks were successfully recruited on both sites from the shrub into the sapling class to maintain or increase overall stand density...|$|E

We compared chemical defences (terpenes), nutritive compounds (nitrogen, non-structural constituents, cellulose, and lignin), as well as age and radial growth of two young spruce categories growing side by side: (1) stunted spruces that were heavily browsed, shorter than the <b>browse</b> <b>line,</b> and (2) escaped spruces that were taller than the <b>browse</b> <b>line</b> but still browsed below the <b>browse</b> <b>line.</b> Es-caped and stunted spruces did not differ in terpene concen-trations, or in nutritive compound contents, suggesting that they had similar palatability. Escaped spruces were older that stunted spruces. Stunted and escaped trees had similar slow growth when young, suggesting no difference in initial browsing between the two spruce categories. For escaped spruce, there was a dramatic increase in radial growth at about 12 – 13 years old, suggesting that the apex of the trees had escaped deer browse. Because the two categories of spruces were equally accessible and did not differ in chemi-cal defences or in nutritive compounds, and because es-caped spruces were older than stunted trees and had a simi-lar slow radial growth in their first 12 – 13 years, we con-clude that morphological differences between stunted and escaped browsed trees are due to age and that {{it is only a matter}} of time before spruce escape deer on Haida Gwaii...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{assessed}} blue oak (Quercus douglasii) sapling {{recruitment and}} regeneration at 15 locations {{distributed throughout the}} range of blue oak. Overall, 15. 3 percent of the 1500 plots surveyed contained blue oak saplings. Four locations had moderate numbers of saplings, and the remaining locations had few to no saplings. Seedling-origin saplings were far more common than stump-sprout saplings. Most saplings were shorter than the <b>browse</b> <b>line</b> (1. 4 m). At 13 of the 15 locations, sapling recruitment is inadequate to offset recent losses in blue oak density and canopy cover. There is a widespread belief that blue oak (Quercus douglasii Hook. & Arn.) is not regenerating well over much of its range. Several researchers have shown that flushes of blue oak recruitment coincided with the influx of settlers into California in the period from the 1850 ’s through the 1890 ’s (McClaran and Bartolome 1989, Mensing 1992, Vankat and Major 1978), but that little recruitment {{has occurred in the}} latter half of this century. Data from two surveys (Bolsinger 1988, Muick and Bartolome 1987) have been interpreted to indicate that blue oak sapling populations are insufficient to maintain current stand densities...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the relationship between giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) and Acacia nigrescens in Kruger National Park, South Africa, to determine whether these tall ungulates may be providing a pollination service for the trees, or are simply flower predators. We quantified florivory and subsequent fruit set in the presence and absence of giraffes. Acacia nigrescens flowers are clearly a substantial dietary component for giraffes. Although A. nigrescens flowers contain almost three times as much condensed tannin as leaves, giraffes consume large quantities of flowers ([similar] 85 % of flowers within reach), resulting in distinct <b>browse</b> <b>lines</b> on the trees. This substantial florivory is detrimental to the overall fecundity of A. nigrescens, with significantly reduced fruit set at heights on trees that are accessible to giraffes. Fruit set increased above the reach of giraffes, suggesting successful pollination by insects. Giraffes were effectively flower predators of A. nigrescens in the season we examined...|$|R

40|$|Urbanization {{throughout}} much of Texas has resulted in diminished wildlife habitat, resulting from fragmented landscapes. Several previous studies addressed the public?s attitudes concerning the most acceptable white-tailed deer management techniques in urban areas. As a departure from these studies on urban residents? acceptance of alternative urban deer management strategies, this study assessed the types of information required by urban residents to more fully understand the best management practices for urban deer herds. Two Texas communities, Lakeway and Hollywood Park, were chosen for this study. Since the 1990 s, urban deer herds have negatively impacted these communities through increased deer-vehicle collisions, defined <b>browse</b> <b>lines</b> throughout the community, and human-deer encounters. The current number of households in each community was determined and {{used to calculate the}} household sample size in Lakeway (N= 4, 090, n = 704) and Hollywood Park (N= 1, 547, n = 616). An Internet survey was developed which asked an adult resident of each selected household about his or her knowledge of factors that lead to population growth in urban white-tailed deer populations, personal encounters with an urban deer herd in the community, the types of management options he or she would choose in dealing with the urban deer herd, and why and what types of information the respondent would most like to have regarding urban deer management. Finally, demographic information was asked such as age, gender, level of education and years of residency in the neighborhood. The information derived from this study reveals the public?s knowledge, attitudes, actions, and expectations concerning over-abundant white-tailed deer populations in Lakeway and Hollywood Park, Texas. This information can be used to assist communities such as Lakeway and Hollywood Park, as well as the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, to develop appropriate educational materials that will provide relevant, current, and accurate information about urban deer population ecology and management for the urban resident. The methods of this study will serve as a useful tool for others to develop pro-active management strategies for controlling over-abundant urban white-tailed deer populations and aid in reducing the conflict between urban deer managers and the public...|$|R
40|$|Quaking aspen is a clonal {{species that}} can produce suckers {{throughout}} its life cycle, resulting in multiple-age classes within a clone. Although each ramet in a clone is genetically identical, we hypothesize that there is physiological variation between the different age classes of the clone. This variation leads to phenotypic diversity, which may increase clonal fitness in response to selection forces. We conducted a study in seven pure aspen clones with 10 identifiable age classes that ranged from first year suckers to overstory trees 3 ̆e 150 years old. We measured specific leaf area, leaf defense chemistry (tannins and phenolic glycosides), carbohydrate and leaf nutrients status, stem water potential and leaf photosynthesis. Each tree was aged by coring and then counting annual rings and clonal relationships were confirmed using microsatellite marker analysis. Phenolic glycosides decreased linearly with age, while condensed tannins increased. Photosynthesis and stem water potential declined markedly after age 40. The data suggests that aspen switch their defense strategy from resistance to tolerance once they grow above the mammal <b>browse</b> <b>line,</b> which may allow them to re-allocate resources from defense to growth. Reductions in photosynthesis and leaf water potential as clones age, may result in greater sensitivity to abiotic and biotic stresses...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLarge herbivores {{and deer}} in {{particular}} can have dramatic effects on ecosystem functions {{and act as}} keystone species in many forest systems. At high densities, deer are assumed to determine the structure and composition of forest understory. The introduction in the late 19 th century of the Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) on Haïda Gwaii archipelago (British Columbia, Canada) gave {{us the opportunity to}} illustrate the effects of predator-free deer populations on previously unbrowsed old-growth forest understory vegetation and the potential for recovery after a prolonged reduction of deer density. We installed and monitored a network of twenty 25 m² enclosures from 1997 to 2005. We compared changes in species richness, apparition events, and vegetation cover by height strata in plots that were fenced or not. Protection from deer had no effect on total species richness but created a stable situation that favoured species appearance and establishment. Species tended to appear first inside the enclosures. The exclusion of deer had a positive effect on overall vegetation cover in height strata directly accessible to deer, but not above the <b>browse</b> <b>line</b> (> 1. 5 m). Deer limited maximum height reached by the species outside the enclosures. Analysis of the vegetation cover by species groups (trees, shrubs, herbs) did not reveal any effect of the exclusion of deer. However, some species as Cornus canadensis, Menziesia ferruginea, Blechnum spicant, Lysichiton americanus exhibited a positive response to the protection from deer whereas more dominant species like Gaultheria shallon and Vaccinium sp. were not influenced. As expected, deer exclusion did result in some recovery of understory in Haïda Gwaii forest understory. Furthermore, fenced plots may be considered as sources for surrounding patches. However the slow vegetation growth recorded associated to potential interspecific competition with browse resistant species could prevent the understory recovery if a significant reduction of deer abundance is not maintained {{over a long period of}} time...|$|E
40|$|Many quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands {{throughout}} western North America {{are considered}} mature, overmature, or decadent, and lack root suckering {{to replace the}} overstory mortality. To mimic natural disturbance and stimulate aspen suckering, prescribed burning or harvesting is needed. It is important to identify pre-disturbance indicators so that land managers will {{have a way to}} assess potential sucker production resulting from a prescribed treatment. In fall 2011, eight field sites were located in the Cedar Mountain study area in southern Utah, and two field sites were located on Deseret Land and Livestock land in northern Utah. At each site, two aspen stands were selected within 50 m of each other, one having a relatively low live aspen basal area and one stand having a relatively high live aspen basal area. Above- and belowground pre-disturbance site characteristics for each paired plot were measured and compared. In spring 2012, all trees within 12. 2 m (40 ft) of plot center were felled to stimulate a suckering response from the root system. Root diameter and root surface area proved to be the best predictors of sucker regeneration density after a disturbance. Sucker densities decrease with increasing root diameters, and most suckers are produced on roots less than 2. 5 cm in diameter. The highest sucker densities were recorded on plots which contained abundant roots less than 2. 5 cm in diameter. A simple methodology for sampling aspen roots in the field is outlined and is based on the relationship between root diameter, root surface area and sucker production. There was no relationship between total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentration in the roots (measured as starch and water soluble carbohydrates (WSC), % dry weight) and sucker density, indicating that TNC concentration cannot be used as an indicator of sucker ability of aspen after a disturbance. This study also documents the effect of herbivory on sucker height. In areas where grazing and browsing pressures were great, sucker potential was severely decreased due to the effects of repeated hedging below the <b>browse</b> <b>line</b> or complete sucker elimination. If aspen are to persist on the landscape under these circumstances, management strategies must be implemented to enhance aspen regeneration...|$|E

40|$|Thousands of {{kilometres}} {{of power}} lines exist {{and more are}} planned. Ungulates that range over large areas are likely to encounter power lines, but a synthesis of power line effects on ungulates is lacking. Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) are suspected to avoid power lines up to distances of 4 km. In contrast, some forest ungulates preferentially forage in power line rights-of-way, cleared areas under power lines. We reviewed the factors that possibly influence avoidance and attraction effects of power lines on ungulates, construct a conceptual framework, and make {{suggestions on how to}} mitigate avoidance effects through power line routing and rights-of-way management. Power line construction, noise and electromagnetic fields are possible sources of disturbance, while rights-of-way management influences habitat use under power lines. Disturbance and altered habitat use can induce barrier and corridor effects, thereby influencing connectivity. Species-specific effects influence behavioural disturbance and habitat use. We found little evidence for behavioural disturbance of reindeer or forest ungulates under power lines. Forest ungulates could benefit from <b>browsing</b> in power <b>line</b> rights-of-way if they are managed to provide abundant and preferred forage as well as sufficient cover. However, power lines may facilitate access for hunters and predators. As a precaution, construction of power lines should be avoided in calving areas. To establish a causal relationship between the construction of power lines and potential avoidance, before-after-impact-control studies are recommended. More research is needed to make recommendations for the optimal design of power line networks. Copyright © 2014 Author(s) retain the copyright of this article.

In the spirit of good hypertext, the WebEx interface lets the user use his or her preferred browsing strategy. Some users may choose to <b>browse</b> the example <b>line</b> by line. Other students may concentrate on the most hard-to-understand lines and selectively read explanations for these lines.

40|$|Portable {{multimedia}} {{devices such}} as digital camera, mobile d evices, personal digtal assistants (PDAs), etc. have limited memory, battery life and processing power. Real time processing and transmission using these devices requires image compression algorithms that can compress efficiently with reduced complexity. Due to limited resources, {{it is not always}} possible to implement the best algorithms inside these devices. In uncompressed form, both raw and image data occupy an unreasonably large space. However, both raw and image data have a significant amount of statistical and visual redundancy. Consequently, the used storage space can be efficiently reduced by compression. In this thesis, some novel low complexity and embedded image compression algorithms are developed especially suitable for low bit rate image compression using these devices. Despite the rapid progress in the Internet and multimedia technology, demand for data storage and data transmission bandwidth continues to outstrip the capabil- ities of available technology. The browsing of images over In ternet from the image data sets using these devices requires fast encoding and decodin g speed with better rate-distortion performance. With progressive picture build up of the wavelet based coded images, the recent multimedia applications demand goo d quality images at the earlier stages of transmission. This is particularly important if the image is <b>browsed</b> over wireless <b>lines</b> where limited channel capacity, storage and computation are the deciding parameters. Unfortunately, the performance of JPEG codec degrades at low bit rates because of underlying block based DCT transforms. Altho ugh wavelet based codecs provide substantial improvements in progressive picture quality at lower bit rates, these coders do not fully exploit the coding performance at lower bit rates. It is evident from the statistics of transformed images that the number of significant coefficients having magnitude higher than earlier thresholds are very few. These wavelet based codecs code zero to each insignificant subband as it moves from coarsest to finest subbands. It is also demonstrated that there could be six to sev en bit plane passes where wavelet coders encode many zeros as many subbands are likely to be insignificant with respect to early thresholds. Bits indicating insignificance of a coefficient or subband are required, but they don’t code information that reduces distortion of the reconstructed image. This leads to reduction of zero distortion for an increase in non zero bit-rate. Another problem associated with wavelet based coders such as Set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT), Set partitioning embedded block (SPECK), Wavelet block-tree coding (WBTC) is because of the use of auxiliary lists. The size of list data structures increase exponentially as more and more eleme nts are added, removed or moved in each bitplane pass. This increases the dynamic memory requirement of the codec, which is a less efficient feature for hardware implementations. Later, many listless variants of SPIHT and SPECK, e. g. No list SPIHT (NLS) and Listless SPECK (LSK) respectively are developed. However, these algorithms have similar rate distortion performances, like the list based coders. An improved LSK (ILSK) algorithm proposed in this dissertation that improves the low b it rate performance of LSK by encoding much lesser number of symbols (i. e. zeros) to several insignificant subbands. Further, the ILSK is combined with a block based transform known as discrete Tchebichef transform (DTT). The proposed new coder isnamed as Hierar-chical listless DTT (HLDTT). DTT is chosen over DCT because of it’s similar energy compaction property like discrete cosine transform (DCT). It is demonstrated that the decoded image quality using HLDTT has better visual performance (i. e., Mean Structural Similarity) than the images decoded using DCT based embedded coders in most of the bit rates. The ILSK algorithm is also combined with Lift based wavelet tra nsform to show the superiority over JPEG 2000 at lower rates in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). A full-scalable and random access decodable listless algorithm is also developed which is based on lift based ILSK. The proposed algorithm named as scalable listless embedded block partitioning (S-LEBP) generates bit stream that offer increasing signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution. These are very useful features for transmission of images in a heterogeneous network that optimally service each user according to available bandwidth and computing needs. Random access decoding is a very useful feature for extracting/manipulating certain ar ea of an image with minimal decoding work. The idea used in ILSK is also extended to encode and decode color images. The proposed algorithm for coding color images is named as Color listless embedded block partitioning (CLEBP) algorithm. The coding efficiency of CLEBP is compared with Color SPIHT (CSPIHT) and color variant of WBTC algorithm. From the simulation results, it is shown that CLEBP exhibits a significant PSNR performance improvement over the later two algorithms on various types of images. Although many modifications to NLS and LSK have been made, the listless modification to WBTC algorithm has not been reported in the literature. Therefore,a listless variant of WBTC (named as LBTC) algorithm is proposed. LBTC not only reduces the memory requirement by 88 - 89...|$|R
