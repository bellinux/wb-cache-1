500|$|McCann {{notes that}} one of the reasons that Grant was so {{successful}} with his film career is that he was not conscious of how handsome he was on screen, acting in a fashion which was most unexpected and unusual from a Hollywood star of that period. George Cukor once stated: [...] "You see, he didn't depend on his looks. He wasn't a narcissist, he acted as though he were just an ordinary young man. And that made it all the more appealing, that a handsome young man was funny; that was especially unexpected and good <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>think,</b> 'Well, if he's a Beau Brummel, he can't be either funny or intelligent', but he proved otherwise". Jennifer Grant acknowledged that her father neither relied on his looks nor was a character actor, and said that he was just the opposite of that, playing the [...] "basic man".|$|E

We are not doing this <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> that is funny to see what the inside of a jail cell looks like, nor because we like the sound of riot police in the streets or the taste of teargas. We are doing this because any other alternative would mean bowing down to the pigs who hide behind their desks and try to control ours and other peoples lives!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Farnsworth said, [...] "There {{had been}} {{attempts}} {{to devise a}} television system using mechanical disks and rotating mirrors and vibrating mirrors — all mechanical. My contribution was {{to take out the}} moving parts and make the thing entirely electronic, and that was the concept that I had when I was just a freshman in high school in the Spring of 1921 at age 14." [...] When Moore asked about others' contributions, Farnsworth agreed, [...] "There are literally thousands of inventions important to television. I hold something in excess of 165 American patents." [...] The host then asked about his current research, and the inventor replied, [...] "In television, we're attempting first to make better utilization of the bandwidth, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> we can eventually get in excess of 2000 lines instead of 525 ... and do it on an even narrower channel ... which will make for a much sharper picture. We believe in the picture-frame type of a picture, where the visual display will be just a screen. And we hope for a memory, so that the picture will be just as though it's pasted on there." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Muqata blog on Jewish Press {{removal of}} the book was hypocritical as Amazon {{continues}} to sell The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and other materials calling for the erasure of Israel, including those that amount to calls for genocide. [...] "Legal Insurrection", a conservative law blog, also said that banning {{the sale of the}} book wasn't justified, particularly since Amazon continues to sell other blank titles, Mein Kampf, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and [...] "Free Palestine" [...] merchandise. Conversely Tom Suarez on Mondoweiss wrote whereas the Protocols claim is correct and that one could argue that Amazon is in fact a [...] "common utility", but that [...] " [...] History of the Palestinian People is explicitly intended to reinforce the dehumanization of an entire people in order to grease the machinery of subjugation and ethnic cleansing". Responding to the continuing sale of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion Amazon said [...] "Amazon strongly believes that providing open access to written speech, no matter how hateful or ugly, {{is one of the most}} important things we do. And <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> the best remedy for offensive speech is more speech, we also make available to readers the ability to make their own voices heard and express their views about this and all our titles in reviews and ratings".|$|E
2500|$|Yearwood {{has found}} major {{influences}} {{in a variety}} of musical artists. She grew accustomed to influence from Southern rock bands, which include The Allman Brothers, Eagles, as well as country rock artists such as Emmylou Harris, Elvis Presley, and James Taylor. Yearwood stated that her primary musical influence is Linda Ronstadt, whom Yearwood had often been identified and compared within her albums. Yearwood says, [...] "She had a power and an emotion in her voice that made you believe every word she sang. My favorite song was probably 'Love Has No Pride,' but I listened to everything over and over. I knew the albums so well I knew which song it was from the first note." [...] She had recorded some of Ronstadt's compositions, including [...] "Try Me Again" [...] for her 2000 album, Real Live Woman. Yearwood said that she has never considered herself as a songwriter, but is precise about choosing songs that she can relate to. She stated, [...] "I always select music based on emotion, how it makes me feel, even before I made records. My producer, Garth Fundis, and I have to catch ourselves if we begin to think about recording a song we don't believe in just <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> it might be a hit." [...] She also stated that even though she does not record any of her own material, she has written music that still has yet to be recorded.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{how they}} chose their name, Jess Origliasso stated: [...] "The name is {{something}} we thought about {{for a short time}} and we wanted it to be a girl's name, but we didn't want it to be 'the Jesses.' We were very conscious of not wanting to make it a twin thing, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> don't <b>think</b> that's really cool." ...|$|R

60|$|Every {{chronicle of}} manners {{has a certain}} value. When customs are {{connected}} with principles, in their origin, development, or end, such records have a double importance; and it is <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> we see such {{a connection between the}} facts and incidents of the Littlepage Manuscripts, and certain important theories of our own time, that we give the former to the world.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2009, Carpenter and the DSM-5 {{schizoaffective}} disorder workgroup {{reported that they}} were [...] "developing new criteria for {{schizoaffective disorder}} to improve reliability and face validity," [...] and were [...] "determining whether the dimensional assessment of mood would justify a recommendation to drop schizoaffective disorder as a diagnostic category." [...] Speaking to an audience at the May 2009 annual conference of the American Psychiatric Association, Carpenter said:We had hoped to get rid of DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder as a diagnostic category <b>because</b> <b>we</b> don't <b>think</b> it's a valid entity and <b>we</b> don't <b>think</b> it's reliable.

60|$|Hume answers this {{question}} in the fifth section, entitled, Why Utility Pleases. He repudiates the deduction of moral approbation from self-love, and utterly denies that we approve of benevolent or just actions <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> of the benefits which {{they are likely to}} confer indirectly on ourselves. The source of the approbation with which we view an act useful to society must be sought elsewhere; and, in fact, {{is to be found in}} that feeling which is called sympathy.|$|E
40|$|Psychology is {{the study}} of mind and behaviour. These two are closely linked, <b>because</b> what <b>we</b> <b>think,</b> feel and believe {{influences}} how we behave. Within the traditional “biomedical” approach to health and illness, psychology had a very small role to play. This approach viewed mind and body as independent. Physical illness may have had psychological consequences, but a person’s psychological state was not considered {{to be related to the}} progression of illness. Treatments were therefore aimed at bringing about physical changes...|$|R
60|$|That is very {{difficult}} for you and me to imagine, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> always <b>think</b> in words. They must think in pictures, I suppose, by remembering things which have happened to them. You and I do that in our dreams. I suspect that savages, who have very few words to express their thoughts with, think in pictures, like their own dogs. But that is a long story. We must see about getting on board now, and under way.|$|R

60|$|We {{have given}} these sketches, drawn from real life, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> {{there is in}} general too little {{consideration}} {{on the part of}} those who give employment to those in situations like the widow here described. The giving of employment is a very important branch of charity, inasmuch as it assists that class of the poor who are the most deserving. It should be looked on in this light, and the arrangements of a family be so made that a suitable compensation can be given, and prompt and cheerful payment be made, without the dread of transgressing the rules of economy.|$|E

Greatness once and forever has done with opinion.

2500|$|Even the {{directors}} have weighed in. Joel Coen found the film [...] "interesting in a genre way; {{but it was}} also interesting to us because it subverts the genre expectations." [...] He did not consider the film a western <b>because</b> [...] "when <b>we</b> <b>think</b> about westerns <b>we</b> <b>think</b> about horses and six-guns, saloons and hitching posts." [...] But co-director Ethan said that the film [...] "is sort of a western," [...] before adding [...] "and sort of not." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{suggest that}} the {{difference}} of opinion, reduced to its lowest terms, is no other than {{the difference between the}} men who think slavery a wrong {{and those who do not}} think it wrong. The Republican party think it wrong--we think it is a moral, a social, and a political wrong. We think it is a wrong not confining itself merely to the persons or the States where it exists, but that it is a wrong which in its tendency, to say the least, affects the existence of the whole nation. <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> it wrong, we propose a course of policy that shall deal with it as a wrong.|$|E

60|$|Well, {{all these}} motives for some {{definite}} {{course of action}} on our part towards foreign countries rest upon very serious facts; too serious, perhaps you will think, to be interfered with; for we are {{all of us in}} the habit of leaving great things alone, as if Providence would mind them, and attending ourselves only to little things which we know, practically, Providence doesn't mind unless we do. We are ready enough to give care to the growing of pines and lettuces, knowing that they don't grow Providentially sweet or large unless we look after them; but we don't give any care to the good of Italy or Germany, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> that they will grow Providentially happy without any of our meddling.|$|E
5000|$|The video (directed by Chris Applebaum) {{features}} American Hi-Fi {{visiting the}} house of a fan in Hays, Kansas, where the band is seen performing the song in the living room, with the house surrounded by hundreds of partying locals.
