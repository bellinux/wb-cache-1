50|$|The {{first section}} of the line was opened between Bristol and Bridgwater on 14 June 1841, just before the GWR {{completed}} its line from London to Bristol. It was 33½ miles (54 km) in length and double track, with a 1½ mile (3 km) single-line branch to Weston-super-Mare. There was no B&ER station at Bristol; a temporary wooden platform at the GWR station was used, and as that station faced London, a <b>backing</b> <b>movement</b> was necessary to reach the point of convergence of the GWR line and the B&ER connecting line.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposePerceptual and videofluoroscopic (VF) {{analyses}} were performed to analyze velopharyngeal (VP) closure motions and tongue <b>backing</b> <b>movement</b> in subjects with postalveolar, palatal, and velar backed articulation (BA). Materials and methodsFor perceptual analysis, {{the timing of the}} appearance of BA and the VP closure level of 22 children with BA following palatal repair were compared to those of 17 subjects with normal articulation, 17 subjects with lateral articulation, and 11 subjects with glottal stop. For VF analysis, 16 subjects with BA and two healthy adult males as references were enrolled. On VF images, the proportions of the time required to complete VP closure and the duration of articulation (VPC/DA) were recorded and then analyzed based on the various degrees of tongue <b>backing</b> <b>movement.</b> ResultsThe appearance of BA was recognized just after the acquisition of VP closure, and it was later than that of glottal stop and earlier than lateral articulation. On VF images, VP closure was achieved before tongue movement in healthy individuals, but after tongue movement in BA subjects. VPC/DA on articulation of both /ta/ and /sa/ were significantly smaller for healthy individuals than for BA subjects (P< 0. 05). The timing of the complete VP closure approached that of articulation when the site of articulation shifted posteriorly (P< 0. 01). ConclusionsBA may result from precedent tongue <b>backing</b> <b>movement</b> before the completion of VP closure, as a process that may assist the VP closure motion for articulation...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine whether tactile suppression, the {{phenomenon}} whereby tactile perception is suppressed during movement, would occur in the context of <b>back</b> <b>movements.</b> Of particular interest, it was investigated if tactile suppression in the back would be attenuated in those suffering from chronic low back pain. Individuals with chronic low back pain (N = 30) and a matched control group (N = 24) detected tactile stimuli on three possible locations (back, arm, chest) while performing a <b>back</b> or arm <b>movement,</b> or no movement. We hypothesized that the movements would induce tactile suppression, and that this effect would be largest for low-intense stimuli on the moving body part. We further hypothesized that, during <b>back</b> <b>movements,</b> tactile suppression on the back would be less pronounced in the chronic low back pain group than in the control group. The results showed the expected general tactile suppression effects. The hypothesis of back-specific attenuation of tactile suppression in the chronic low back pain group was not supported. However, back-specific tactile suppression in the chronic low back pain group was less pronounced in those who performed the <b>back</b> <b>movements</b> more slowly...|$|R

40|$|Back {{problems}} are important contributors to {{poor performance in}} sport horses. It {{has been shown that}} kinematic analysis can differentiate horses with back problems from asymptomatic horses. The underlying mechanism can, however, only be identified in a uniform, experimental setting. Our aim was to determine if induction of back pain in a well-defined site would result in a consistent change in <b>back</b> <b>movement.</b> <b>Back</b> kinematics were recorded at a walk and trot on a treadmill. Unilateral back pain was then induced by injecting lactic acid into the left longissimus dorsi muscle. Additional measurements were done subsequent to the injections. Data were captured during steady state locomotion at 240 Hz using an infrared-based gait analysis system. After the injections, the caudal thoracic back was more extended at both gaits. The back was also bent more to the left at both gaits. However, at the walk, there was a reversed pattern after a week with bending of the back to the unaffected side. Horses with identical back injuries appear to show similar changes in their back kinematics, as compared to the asymptomatic condition. Unilateral back pain seems to result in an increased extension of the back, as well as compensatory lateral <b>movements.</b> <b>Back</b> <b>movements</b> are complex and subtle, and changes are difficult to detect with the human eye. Present-day gait analysis systems can identify changes in the <b>back</b> <b>movement,</b> and knowledge of the relationship between such changes and the site of injury will be of help in better localising and diagnosing disorders of the equine back...|$|R

40|$|Tactile {{perception}} is often impaired during movement. The present study investigated whether such sensory suppression also occurs during <b>back</b> <b>movements,</b> and whether {{this would be}} modulated by attention. In two tactile detection experiments, participants simultaneously engaged in a movement task, in which they executed a back-bending movement, and a perceptual task, consisting of the detection of subtle tactile stimuli administered to their upper or lower back. The focus of participants' attention was manipulated by raising the probability {{that one of the}} back locations would be stimulated. The results revealed that tactile detection was suppressed during the execution of the <b>back</b> <b>movements.</b> Furthermore, the results of Experiment 2 revealed that when the stimulus was always presented to the attended location, tactile suppression was substantially reduced, suggesting that sensory suppression can be modulated by top-down attentional processes. The potential of this paradigm for studying tactile information processing in clinical populations is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} if any effect can be registered with an inertial motion sensor unit on lame horses and on horses' <b>back</b> <b>movement,</b> caused by the Equiband™ system. Within a period of six weeks, six mildly lame horses were measured four days. The weeks were divided as followed: two weeks measurements, two weeks as a 'wash out'-period and two weeks measurements again. The horses were led in-hand in walk and trot in a straight line on a hard surface. Five 'exercise' conditions were defined: 1) No Equiband™, 2) With only abdominal band, 3) With both bands on the same time, 4) With only hind quarter band and 5) No Equiband™. Condition 1 was used as the baseline, and differences between condition 1 and the other 4 conditions were calculated. These differences were the results used for the statistical analysis and were named condition 12 - 11, 13 - 11, 14 - 11 and 15 - 11. Eight inertial motion sensors measuring rotational and translational acceleration and orientation were used to determine <b>back</b> <b>movement</b> and movement symmetry as an indicator for lameness. The Equiband™ system was not found to have a statistically significant effect on the lameness of horses, indicated by the movement symmetry. In walk a higher range of motion in dorso-ventral <b>back</b> <b>movement</b> of the thoracic and lumbar spines was visible for the horses wearing both bands or only the hind quarter band than for the same horses wearing only the abdominal band or no Equiband™. In trot the dorso-ventral <b>movement</b> of the <b>back,</b> starting at the lumbar spines, and the medio-lateral movement from the thoracic and lumbar spines in trot showed a significant decrease in the range of motion when the horses were wearing the Equibands™ in comparison with the condition in which the horses were not wearing any Equibands™...|$|R

Wearable motion capture systems are potentially useful to monitor lower <b>back</b> <b>movement</b> in healthcare workers to help avoid the risk factors. In this study, we propose a novel system using sheet stretch sensors and investigate the system validity for estimating lower <b>back</b> <b>movement.</b> Methods Six volunteers (female: male = 1 : 1, mean age: 24. 8 ± 4. 0 years, height 166. 7 ± 5. 6 cm, weight 56. 3 ± 7. 6 kg) participated in test protocols that involved executing seven types of movements. The movements were three uniaxial trunk movements (i. e., trunk flexion-extension, trunk side-bending, and trunk rotation) and four multiaxial trunk movements (i. e., flexion + rotation, flexion + side-bending, side-bending + rotation, and moving around the cranial-caudal axis). Each trial lasted for approximately 30 s. Four stretch sensors were attached to each participant's lower back. The lumbar motion angles were estimated using simple linear regression analysis based on the stretch sensor outputs and compared with those obtained by the optical motion capture system. Results The estimated lumbar motion angles showed a good correlation with the actual angles, with correlation values of r = 0. 68 (SD = 0. 35), r = 0. 60 (SD = 0. 19), and r = 0. 72 (SD = 0. 18) for the flexion-extension, side bending, and rotation movements, respectively (all P < 0. 05).
