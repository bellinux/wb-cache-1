25|$|<b>But</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> go to {{pictures}} {{for the sake}} of seeing pictures will see a great one. For The Grapes of Wrath is possibly the best picture ever made from a so-so book...Camera craft purged the picture of the editorial rash that blotched the Steinbeck book. Cleared of excrescences, the residue is a great human story which made thousands of people, who damned the novel's phony conclusions, read it. It is the saga of an authentic U.S. farming family who lose their land. They wander, they suffer, but they endure. They are never quite defeated, and their survival is itself a triumph.|$|E
25|$|One belief {{was that}} American Indians were too unsophisticated to have {{constructed}} such complex earthworks and artifacts. The associated stone, metal, and clay artifacts {{were thought to}} be too complex for the Indians to have made. In the American Southeast, and Midwest, numerous Indian cultures were sedentary and used agriculture. Numerous Indian towns had built surrounding stockades for defense. Capable of this type of construction, they and ancestors could have built mounds, <b>but</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> believed that the Indians did not build the earthworks did not analyze it in this manner. They thought the Native American nomadic cultures would not organize to build such monuments, for failure to devote the time and effort to construct such time-consuming projects.|$|E

25|$|For {{the past}} thirty years the Greater Cleveland area {{population}} has been in decline especially in terms of non-Hispanic whites all the while still being the most diverse region in the State. But at the same time has become even more increasingly diverse as well. As of 2010 both the Hispanic and Asian population in the Cleveland-Akron-Ashtabula area grew by almost 40%, Hispanics now number at 112,307 (up from 80,738 in 2000). And Asian alone accounts for 55,087 (up from 39,586 in 2000) <b>but</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> cite Asian and other ethnicites enumerate 67,231. The Chinese Americans are the oldest Asian group residing in Northeast Ohio, most visible in Cleveland's Chinatown. Nevertheless, the area is also home to hundreds of Thais, Taiwanese, Pakistanis, Laotians, Cambodians, and Burmese peoples as well.|$|E
500|$|The Undiscovered Countrys cast {{includes}} the final group {{appearance of the}} main actors from the original television series. Casting director Mary Jo Slater loaded the film with as many Hollywood stars as the production could afford, including a minor appearance by Christian Slater, her son, as an Excelsior officer; Cinefantastique considered the cameo a likely attempt to lure younger audiences. Meyer was interested in casting actors who could project and articulate feelings, even through alien makeup. Producer Ralph Winter said, [...] "We were not {{looking for someone to}} say 'Okay, I'll do it', <b>but</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were excited by the material [...] and would treat it as if it was the biggest picture ever being made." ...|$|E
500|$|The DVD boxset for season six was {{released}} by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada on August 16, 2005, ten years after it had completed broadcast on television. As well as every episode from the season, the DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes, Animatics, and commentaries for every episode. The menus follow the same format as the previous season's set. The packaging was changed from the standard box design, used for the previous five seasons, to a plastic clamshell design shaped like Homer's head. After many fans complained of the format change, a standard box was produced, with a [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" [...] theme. The season was not offered for retail sale in North America in the standard box, <b>but</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had bought the head design and preferred the alternative were offered the standard box free of charge. In the United Kingdom, the Homer head packaging {{was released}} as a limited edition item, with only 50,000 copies using the design. All other copies used the standard box format. The next four seasons were subsequently released in both a standard and head-shaped packaging in North America, as well as overseas.|$|E

500|$|Pool of Radiance {{received}} positive reviews. G.M. {{called the}} game's graphics [...] "good" [...] and praised its role-playing and combat aspects. They felt that [...] "roleplayers will find Pools {{is an essential}} purchase, <b>but</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are solely computer games oriented may hesitate before buying it [...] it will be their loss". Tony Dillon from Commodore User giving it a score of 9 out of 10. The only complaint was a slightly slow disk access, but the reviewer {{was impressed with the}} game's features, awarding it a Commodore User superstar and proclaiming it [...] "the best RPG ever to grace the C64, or indeed any other computer". Issue #84 of the British magazine Computer + Video Games rated the game highly, saying that [...] "Pools is a game which no role player or adventurer should be without and people new to role playing should seriously consider buying as an introductory guide". Another UK publication, The Games Machine, gave the game an 89% rating. The reviewer noted that the third-person arcade style combat view is a great improvement for SSI, as they had traditionally incorporated simplistic graphics in their role-playing games. The reviewer was critical that Pool of Radiance was not original in its presentation and that the colors were a little drab, but concluded that the game is [...] "classic Dungeons & Dragons which SSI have recreated excellently". A review from Zzap was less positive, giving the game a score of 80%. The reviewer felt that the game required too much [...] "hacking, slicing and chopping" [...] without enough emphasis on puzzle solving. The game was awarded 49% for its puzzle factor.|$|E

2500|$|Director Darabont {{chose to}} film The Mist after filming the [...] "straighter dramas" [...] The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile because he [...] "wanted {{to make a}} very direct, muscular kind of film".

[...] King said, [...] "The ending is such a jolt—wham!

Others, who were merely annoyed at the exaggerations, propaganda and phony pathos of John Steinbeck's best selling novel, may just stay away. Pinkos who did not bat an eye when the Soviet Government exterminated 3,000,000 peasants by famine, will go for a good cry over the hardships of the Okies. <b>But</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> go to pictures for the sake of seeing pictures will see a great one. [...] For The Grapes of Wrath is possibly the best picture ever made from a so-so book. It is certainly the best picture Darryl F. Zanuck has produced or Nunnally Johnson scripted. It would be the best John Ford had directed if he had not already made The Informer.|$|E

Ulysses, {{the figure in the}} larger horn of the flame, narrates the tale of his last voyage and death (Dante's invention). He tells how, after his detainment by Circe, his love for neither his son, his father, nor his wife could overpower his desire to set out on the open sea to [...] "gain experience of the world / and of the vices and the worth of men".
