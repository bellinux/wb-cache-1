40|$|Four trienyl hydrocarbons, (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9) -tricosatriene (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 23 :HC), (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9) -pentacosatriene (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 25 :HC), (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9) -heptacosatriene (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 27 :HC), and (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9) -nonacosatriene (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 29 :HC) were {{identified}} in a non-polar fraction of the body wax {{of male and female}} yellow peach moth, Conogethes punctiferalis. The relative amounts and ratios of these hydrocarbons differed between sexes. In females, the ratios in body wax and pheromone gland extracts were similar, with lesser amounts found in gland extracts. Synergistic effects of these hydrocarbons when added to the known aldehyde pheromone components were assessed in wind tunnel tests. A blend of (E) - 10 -hexadecenal (E 10 - 16 : Ald) and (Z) - 10 -hexadecenal (Z 10 - 16 : Ald) elicited upwind flight and orientation of males to the pheromone source, but arriving males did not remain close to source for very long. Among the hydrocarbons identified, only Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 23 :HC enhanced the activity of the <b>aldehyde</b> <b>blend</b> by increasing the time spent close to the source and the number of source contacts. Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 23 :HC and (Z 9) -heptacosene (Z 9 - 27 :HC) also increased close-range responses to the <b>aldehyde</b> <b>blend.</b> The activity of the <b>aldehyde</b> <b>blend</b> plus these two hydrocarbons was similar to that of crude pheromone extract. Positive dose-response relationships between the <b>aldehyde</b> <b>blend</b> and two hydrocarbon mixtures were found. The lowest doses that elicited synergism were 10 − 1 female equivalents (of body wax extracts) for the two hydrocarbons, and 10 − 2 female equivalents for the total unsaturated hydrocarbon mixture...|$|R
40|$|The greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella (L.), is {{a serious}} and {{widespread}} pest of the honeybee, Apis mellifera L. In contrast to most moths, for which long-range mate finding is mediated by female-produced sex pheromones, G. mellonella males attract conspecific females over long distances by emitting large amounts of a characteristic scent in combination with bursts of ultrasonic calls. The male scent for this species was previously identified as a blend of nonanal and undecanal. When these compounds were bioassayed, characteristic short-range sexual behavior, including wing fanning, was triggered in conspecific females, but the <b>aldehyde</b> <b>blend</b> failed to elicit attraction over longer distances. We identified, via analysis and synthesis, a third male-specific compound, 5, 11 -dimethylpentacosane. We show that it acts as a behavioral synergist to the aldehydes. In wind tunnel experiments, very few female moths responded to the <b>aldehyde</b> <b>blend</b> or to 5, 11 -dimethylpentacosane tested separately, but consistently showed orientation and source contact when {{a combination of all}} three compounds was applied. The level of attraction to the three-component mixture was still lower than that to male extract, indicating that the composition of compounds in the synthetic blend is suboptimal, or that additional pheromone components of G. mellonella are yet to be identified. The identification of 5, 11 -dimethylpentacosane is an important step for the development of an efficient long-range attractant that will be integrated with other environmentally safe strategies to reduce damage to beehives caused by wax moths...|$|R

40|$|Bracon hebetor is a larval ectoparasitoid that {{utilizes}} several pests {{belonging to}} the family Pyralidae (Lepidoptera) as hosts. In the present study, we analyzed the kairomonal response of this wasp to the male-produced sex pheromone of a host, the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella, an economically important pest of honeybees, Apis mellifera. Coupled gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) revealed three compounds in headspace collections from male G. mellonella that elicited responses from B. hebetor antennae: decanal and the previously identified sex pheromone components, nonanal and undecanal. Y-tube olfactometer tests that used na < ve, mated wasps showed that females, but not males, were highly attracted to (a) male G. mellonella headspace samples, (b) two synthetic blends of nonanal and undecanal (in ratios matching that found in male moth samples), and (c) the two aldehydes tested individually. Further, female wasps did not discriminate between a <b>blend</b> of <b>aldehydes</b> and male G. mellonella headspace. In dose-response trials that used octanal, nonanal, decanal, and undecanal, no difference in EAG responses of the two sexes was observed, except for undecanal at the second highest dose, for which female antennae showed significantly larger responses than did male antennae. When the two binary blends were tested at different doses, female wasps were significantly attracted to the two highest doses (1 A mu g and 10 A mu g), {{but not to the}} lowest dose (100 ng). Our results show that females of this economically important parasitoid utilize the male-produced sex pheromone of a host as an indirect cue to guide them to potential oviposition sites...|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel {{is a kind}} of {{high-quality}} alternative fuel of diesel engine. In this study, biodiesel and biodiesel/diesel blend were used in a single cylinder diesel engine to study the carbonyl emissions. The result shows that carbonyl pollutants of biodiesel and biodiesel/diesel <b>blend</b> are mainly <b>aldehyde</b> and ketone compounds with 1 – 3 carbon atoms, and formaldehyde concentration is higher than 80 % of the total carbonyl pollutants for biodiesel. The formaldehyde concentration peak is reduced with the increase of intake temperature (T), intake pressure (P), and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) ratio and increased with the increase of compression ratio (ε). When excess air coefficient (λ) is lower than 1. 7, the formaldehyde concentration is increased with the increase of excess air ratio. When λ is higher than 1. 7, the formaldehyde concentration is reduced with the increase of excess air ratio. The dilution of air can reduce formaldehyde concentration in the premixed flame of diesel effectively; however, it has less effect on biodiesel. Among the fuel pretreatment measures of adding hydrogen, CO, and methane, the addition of hydrogen shows the best effect on reducing formaldehyde of biodiesel...|$|R

Here, we present evidence of the effectiveness of linalool oxide (LO), a single plant-based lure previously developed for malaria vectors in trapping RVF vectors, Aedes mcintoshi and Aedes ochraceus, and dengue vector, Aedes aegypti. METHODS : For RVF vectors, we used CDC traps to evaluate the performance of LO against three vertebrate-based lures: CO 2 (dry ice), BioGent (BG) lure, and HONAD (a <b>blend</b> of <b>aldehydes)</b> in 2 experiments with Completely Randomized design: 1) using unlit CDC traps baited separately with LO, HONAD and BG-lure, and unlit CDC trap + CO 2 and lit CDC trap as controls, 2) similar treatments but with inclusion of CO 2 to all the traps. For dengue vectors, LO was evaluated against BG lure using BG sentinel traps, in a 3 × 6 Latin Square design, first as single lures and then combined with CO 2 and traps baited with CO 2 included as controls. Trap captures were compared between the treatments using Chi square and GLM. RESULTS : Low captures of RVF vectors were recorded for all lures in the absence of CO 2 with no significant difference between them. When combined with CO 2, LO performance in trapping these vectors was comparable to BG-lure and HONAD but it was less effective than the lit CDC trap. In the absence of CO 2, LO performed comparably with the BGlure in trapping female Ae. aegypti, but with significantly higher males recorded in traps baited with the plant-based lure. When CO 2 was added, LO was significantly better than the BG-lure with a 2. 8 - fold increase in captures of male Ae. aegypti. CONCLUSIONS : These results highlight the potential of LO as a generalist plant-based lure for mosquito disease vectors, pending further assessment of possible specificity in their response profile to the different stereoisomers of this compound.

Compounds extracted from pheromone glands were identified by coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and coupled GC-mass spectrometry (MS). In field trapping experiments, Z 11 – 16 :Ald, Z 7 – 16 :Ald or Z 13 – 18 :Ald singly were behaviourally inactive, but in ternary combination were as attractive as virgin females. Deleting either Z 11 – 16 :Ald or Z 7 – 16 :Ald from the ternary <b>aldehyde</b> <b>blend</b> strongly reduced attractiveness indicating that these two compounds are most important for attraction of males. Congeneric and sympatric female D. grandiosella (Dyar) also utilize Z 11 – 16 :Ald and Z 13 – 18 :Ald as sex pheromone components. Production of Z 9 – 16 :Ald by female D. grandiosella and Z 7 – 16 :Ald by female D. considerata contributes to the specificity of pheromone blends but does not prevent cross-attraction of heterospecific males. In sugarcane plantations, aldehyde (Z 11 – 16 :Ald, Z 7 – 16 :Ald and Z 13 – 18 :Ald) -impregnated lures may replace females as trap baits to monitor population densities of D. considerata.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Effective {{surveillance}} and {{estimation of the}} biting fraction of Aedes aegypti is critical for accurate determination {{of the extent of}} virus transmission during outbreaks and inter-epidemic periods of dengue and chikungunya fever. Here, we describe the development and use of synthetic human odor baits for improved sampling of adult Ae. aegypti, in two dengue and chikungunya fevers endemic areas in Kenya; Kilifi and Busia counties. METHODS : We collected volatiles from the feet and trunks of two female and two male volunteers aged between 25 and 45 years. We used coupled gas chromatography- electroantennographic detection (GC/EAD) analysis to screen for antennally-active components from the volatiles and coupled GC-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to identify the EAD-active components. Using randomized replicated designs, we compared the efficacies of Biogents (BG) sentinel traps baited with carbon dioxide plus either single or blends of the identified compounds against the BG sentinel trap baited with carbon dioxide plus the BG commercial lure in trapping Ae. aegypti. The daily mosquito counts in the different traps were subjected to negative binomial regression following the generalized linear models procedures. RESULTS : A total of ten major EAD-active components identified by GC/MS as mainly aldehydes and carboxylic acids, were consistently isolated from the human feet and trunk volatiles from at least two volunteers. Field assays with synthetic chemicals of the shared EAD-active components identified from the feet and trunk gave varying results. Ae. aegypti were more attracted to carbon dioxide baited BG sentinel traps combined with <b>blends</b> of <b>aldehydes</b> than to similar traps combined with blends of carboxylic acids. When we assessed the efficacy of hexanoic acid detected in odors of the BG commercial lure and volunteers plus carbon dioxide, trap captures of Ae. aegypti doubled over the trap baited with the commercial BG lure. However, dispensing aldehydes and carboxylic acids together in blends, reduced trap captures of Ae. aegypti by ~ 45 %- 50 %. CONCLUSIONS : Our results provide evidence for roles of carboxylic acids and aldehydes in Ae. aegypti host attraction and also show that of the carboxylic acids, hexanoic acid is a more effective lure for the vector than the BG commercial lure.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{focus on}} the alarm-defense system of the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, its {{effectiveness}} against pathogen attacks, and {{its role as a}} mechanism of communication for conspecifics. This dual role of an alarm-defense system is efficient and effective considering that the two functions are typically required simultaneously in times of danger; the same substance should serve both purposes. First, I surveyed the most common types of commercial bed bug treatments to determine long-term efficacy. Regardless of the treatment, chemical or heat, retreatments for bed bug infestations were required. After 3 years, 20. 8 % of housing units receiving a chemical treatment required additional treatments; 9. 5 % of units receiving heat treatments required a retreatment during the same period. Multifamily units required retreatments significantly more than all other housing types. Given these findings that emphasize the necessity for a multifaceted IPM program, I investigated whether the entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, could be used to control bed bugs. Feeding experiments demonstrated that bed bugs were innately susceptible to this fungus. However, regardless of whether bed bugs were sprayed with a fungal solution or contacted a treated surface, only at 98 % humidity was mortality high. In addition, the two major aldehydes (E) - 2 -hexenal and (E) - 2 -octenal emitted as defensive secretions by bed bugs inhibited the in vitro growth of an isolate of M. anisopliae. The ability to accurately and quickly detect new infestations is a critical element to an IPM-based strategy. This detection requires an understanding of attraction behavior and cues. I show through use of video-tracking software, (E) - 2 -hexenal and (E) - 2 -octenal attract adult bed bugs. Behavioral assays determined both males and females were attracted to 0. 04 ug of an <b>aldehyde</b> <b>blend</b> for up to two hours after initial treatment of filter paper disks. Results suggest that these bed bug secretions may be candidates for lures and monitors. Taken together, this research describes the chemical ecology of bed bugs, providing insight into relevant signaling and defensive behavior, which has direct implications on pest management practices...|$|R
40|$|A Thesis Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Award of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Veterinary Entomology in the School of Pure and Applied Sciences of Kenyatta University, 2008 : The SF 807. 03 A {{synthetic}} repellent for savannah tsetse (2 -methoxy- 4 -methylphenol), {{which is}} a synthetic analogue of a mild natural repellent (2 -methoxyphenol), found in the body odours of tsetse bovid hosts was recently identified. Preliminary field trials indicated that the repellent could provide substantial protection to cattle. The repellent could also be integrated with other tsetse control tactics in a 'push-pull' strategy that uses repellents to `push' the flies away from their hosts, in conjunction with baited traps/targets, which `pull' and kill them. This study evaluated {{the efficacy of the}} 'push-pull' tactic in enhancing tsetse suppression rates and disease levels using on-host repellents to `push' and baited traps to `pull' the flies in Shimba Hills, Kwale District, Kenya. From cross-sectional surveys conducted in the area, livestock farmers considered livestock diseases; trypanosomosis, anaplasmosis, East Coast fever and foot-and-mouth disease to be the major constraints to livestock production in the area. Trypanosomosis was the most important compared to other diseases. Chemotherapy was the most widely used method of controlling the disease. Farmer-based tsetse control strategies were poorly adopted. Most farmers demonstrated awareness about trypanosomosis, its clinical symptoms, aetiology, correct treatment and control measures. Survey of the epidemiology of cattle trypanosomosis in the area indicated that, Glossina austeni, G. brevipalpis and G. pallidipes were found in the area. Trypanosoma congolense and T. vivax were diagnosed in cattle with infection prevalences in the animals varying between 0 and 25 %. A field trial conducted in the area {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} 'push-pull' tactic for tsetse and trypanosomosis control indicated that the 'push-pull' might be a more effective way of reducing tsetse populations, trypanosomosis disease incidences and trypanocidal drug use and improving herd health and productivity compared to `push' or `pull'. 'Push-pull' gave significantly higher reduction (62 %) in trypanosomosis incidence compared to `push' (59 %) and `pull' (53 %) (x 2 = 65. 4; df = 2; p < 0. 001). Risk of transmission of trypanosomosis in the controls was upto three times significantly (X 2 = 43. 2; df= 1; p < 0. 0001) higher than protected cattle. Body weight, body condition and packed cell volume levels were significantly (F = 48. 9; df = 1; p < 0. 01) higher in protected cattle than controls. Percentage reduction in G. pallidipes relative density in 'push-pull' was 83 % compared to 77 % in `pull' sites. Households with protected cattle recorded significant reduction in trypanocidal drug use (X 2 = 11. 8; df = 1; p = 0. 003). Following the trial, livestock farmers' perceptions on the impacts of the repellent and traps on tsetse challenge and trypanosomosis risk were assessed. Most farmers considered significant reduction in trypanocidal drug use, disease incidence and tsetse population to be the most important benefits of repellents and traps. Additional benefits included quieter grazing, protection of goats and opening up of previously avoided fields for grazing and crop production. Most farmers preferred repellents or traps or both to current methods of tsetse and trypanosomosis control. All farmers preferred repellents to traps. With a view of increasing the potency of the `pull' component, trials conducted to evaluate the attractiveness of <b>aldehyde</b> <b>blends</b> showed that the blends when used alone did not significantly increase trap catches (x 2 = 0. 61; df = 1; p = 0. 461), but when combined with cow urine and/ or acetone, they increased the catches, although this was not statistically significant (x 2 = 0. 85; df = 1; p = 0. 644). Repellents could be integrated with other tsetse control techniques such as traps in enhancing tsetse and disease suppression. Kenyatta universit...|$|R
40|$|Starch-based {{materials}} {{show potential}} as fully degradable plastics. However, the current applicability {{of these materials}} is limited due to their poor moisture tolerance and mechanical properties. Starch is therefore frequently blended with other polymers to make the material more suitable for special or severe circumstances. By varying {{the components of the}} blend and the process conditions, the morphology and hence the properties can be controlled. A clear understanding over the structure formation process will allow the development of new, biodegradable blends based on starch-based materials with better properties. The overall goal of this thesis was thus to develop insight in how the material (blend) properties depend on the processing, and based on this insight, explore new processing routes. Structure-function relationships: exploring a polymer science approach In Chapter 2, we discuss the relation between the performance of a plasticized starchbased film, in terms of permeation of volatile components, and its composition. Estimations of the Maxwell-Stefan diffusion rates of trace volatile components through plasticized starch films were developed based on free-volume theory and the Flory-Huggins-Maxwell- Stefan (FHMS) equation. The model correctly predicted the order of magnitude of the permeation fluxes of diacetyl and carvone through starch films. The results of this chapter show that blending of starch with hydrophobic polymers could be an effective way to improve the barrier properties of the film. In Chapter 3, the influence of alternative plasticizers (i. e., glucose and glycerol) on the gelatinization and melting of concentrated starch mixtures was studied, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The results were interpreted using an extended form of the well-known Flory-Huggins equation. The chapter exemplified the possibilities of using theories that were traditionally applied to synthetic polymers, to biomaterials, in spite of their much greater complexity. This approach led to quantitative and qualitative understanding of the influence of small plasticizers of industrial relevance on the gelatinization and melting of starch. Comparing the Flory-Huggins model results with experimental results, showed that the approach is useful for interpreting and predicting the gelatinization and melting behavior of ternary starch-based systems. It also showed that since the experiments were complex, systems were often not in true equilibrium and other disturbing effects were easily encountered. Therefore, one should be cautious to use experimental results for characterizing the thermodynamics of gelatinization in multicomponent systems. Processing: the use of simple shear In Chapter 4, the use of simple shear as an instrument for structure formation of plasticized starch-protein blends was introduced. A novel shearing device was developed to explore the formation of new types of microstructures in concentrated starch-zein blends. This device was used to process different ratios of starch and zein (0 – 20 % zein, dry basis) to study the influence of the matrix composition and processing conditions on the properties of the final material. Confocal scanning laser microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy showed that under shearless conditions, the starch-zein blend forms a co-continuous blend. Shear transformed this structure into a dispersion, with zein being the dispersed phase. The large deformation properties were examined by tensile tests in the flow and the vorticity directions; they could be described using a model for blends having poor adhesion between the continuous and dispersed phases. In Chapter 5, we studied the effect of compatibilization, i. e., improvement of the adhesion between the continuous and dispersed phases in starch-zein blends through the incorporation of a component having affinity for both phases. Aldehyde starch was synthesized by introducing a reactive functional group (aldehyde). This group then reacted in the blend with zein (and/or other components), forming a macromolecular compatibilizer in situ. The effect of this compatabilizer on the interfacial properties of the blend was studied using different zein ratios. The blends showed improved adhesion between the zein and starch phases compared to the blends described in chapter 4. The aldehyde starch however also influenced the properties of the starch matrix (higher viscosity, stronger molecular breakdown, browning), which indicates that indeed physical or chemical crosslinks were formed inside the starch matrix, {{but on the other hand}} posed a limitation for practical applicability. Chapter 6 presented the use of rise bran extract as a food-grade compatibilizer for starchzein blends. This material was extracted from rice brans using super-critical water, probably contains Maillard components and shows activity as radical scavenger, antioxidant and surfactant. The influence of rice bran extract as compatibilizer was compared with that of aldehyde starch by preparing blends under shear conditions. Field emission scanning electron microscopy showed that both compatibilizers improved the adhesion between the zein and starch phases. The mechanical properties of the <b>blends</b> compatibilized with <b>aldehyde</b> starch showed poorer mechanical properties after storage under controlled conditions, possibly caused by retrogradation of starch. The use of rice bran extract as compatibilizer however led to good compatibilization with good stability during storage. The good compatibilization by rice bran extract was suggested to be caused by polysaccharide-protein complexes, which are also responsible for its emulsifying properties. Application In Chapter 7, the conclusions of the preceding chapters were collectively interpreted. First, the use of a heuristic approach for the rational design of thermoplastic starch-based materials was described. Then the use of the ternary diagram for the system starch-waterglucose developed in Chapter 3 was used to evaluate alternatives routes for the intensification of the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch. Finally, future trends in the development of starch-based materials were presented following the insights obtained in this thesis. These include the use of established theories developed for synthetic polymers, further exploration of the concept of compatibilization of starch-based blends, and the development of new processing equipment dedicated to material structuring...|$|R
