Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship.

500|$|Davies' {{next project}} after Cucumber and Banana will be The Boys, a Channel 4 series about the HIV/AIDS crisis during the 1980s. The <b>Boys</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a dramatised {{retrospective}} {{of the crisis}} which focuses on the men [...] "living in the bedsits" [...] during the 1980s as opposed to films such as Pride which focus on gay activists; Davies notes that the stories regarding {{the politics of the}} crisis and the virus itself has been told, but not those regarding the early victims of the virus itself. Davies describes The Boys as a way of [...] "coming to terms" [...] with his own actions during the 1980s, when the shock of the crisis prevented him from properly mourning the deaths of his close friends. After The Boys, Davies plans to write a series about sextortion that draws inspiration from real-life incidents of blackmail that resulted in suicide.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the first}} episode aired, {{journalist}} Patrick Strudwick asked, [...] "Channel 4, why call your new documentary My Transsexual Summer? It sounds like gender tourism, a fun little trip to the other side." [...] Sarah Dean, an entertainment editor for The Huffington Post UK, called the title [...] "sensationalist". Although Sarah Lake of Trans Media Watch found the title contentious, she defended it {{by pointing out that}} transition is a temporary process like coming of age; even so, she believed the title to be [...] "only slightly better" [...] than the [...] "dire and totally inappropriate" [...] working title, Girls Will Be Boys and <b>Boys</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> Girls. Her overall assessment was that [...] "although the programme makers undeniably made some compromises to draw in viewers, millions will have enjoyed the company of these seven, shared in their lives and learned a lesson in diversity.… They will now have an entry point to broadening their understanding of the rich and joyful diversity of gender experience, something which has always existed but of which they were previously unaware." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{first film}} {{for the film}} studio was <b>Boys</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> Boys, in which the {{screenplay}} was written by Hay himself, the film's satirical approach towards {{the public school system}} was loosely based on the humor of the Daily Express columnist, Beachcomber. The film was widely {{regarded as one of the}} most subversive of its time due to the satire towards how authority is portrayed in the film, and was granted an A (adult) certificate by the British Board of Film Classification. <b>Boys</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> Boys is widely regarded as Hay's break-out film, writing for The Spectator, Graham Greene characterised the film as [...] "very amusing", describing Hay's portrayal of Dr. Smart as [...] "competent" [...] and praised Claude Dampier's portrayal of Second Master Finch (Hay's adversary) as the film's [...] "finest performance". Several years later, the Radio Times Guide to Films gave <b>Boys</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> Boys three stars out of five, observing that the film contains [...] "the blend of bluster and disthonesty that makes his films irresistible".|$|E

2500|$|Kent {{returned}} {{to compete for}} the Thames Challenge Cup in 1933 with the support of President Franklin D. Roosevelt who sent a letter to Father Sill offering [...] " [...] good wishes for a successful trip" [...] and commenting on how [...] "the presence of a crew of American school <b>boys</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> helpful in strengthening the ties between good sportsmen of the two countries." [...] That year, Kent won the Thames Challenge Cup, just six years after crew began at the school. The Times in Britain wrote, [...] "Kent School were almost certainly the best crew that ever rowed in the Thames Cup." [...] Kent continued to succeed in the sport, competing at Henley 32 times and winning 5 times, most recently in 1972. The school was featured twice in Life magazine, once in May, 1937 and again in June, 1948. Stuart Auchincloss '48 was featured {{on the cover of the}} latter publication.

2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{alleged that}} Jackson showed pornography to children at Neverland, including the accuser and his brother. [...] The raids on Neverland produced {{an accumulation of}} ten years' worth of heterosexual adult magazines such as Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler along with various heterosexual pornographic videos and websites on his computer. The prosecution alleged these were used for grooming young victims. [...] Brett Barnes and Wade Robson, two {{men who had been}} friends with Jackson since childhood, testified that they had not been [...] "aware that [...] possessed sexually explicit material" [...] until the trial. There were also a few books seized (from a library of thousands) that the prosecution suggested were evidence of homosexuality and/or pedophilia. [...] <b>Boys</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> Boys included pictures of boys, many naked, in various non-sexual activities such as climbing a tree or sitting on a bench. The book had an inscription reading, [...] "To Michael: From your fan. Love XXXOOO Rhonda – 1983, Chicago." [...] Wade Robson testified he considered <b>Boys</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> Boys [...] "not a pornographic book," [...] and said he would not be concerned about its owner being in the same bed with a 12-year-old. Another book, The Boy: A Photographic Essay, was inscribed, [...] "Look at the true spirit of happiness and joy in these boys' faces. This is the spirit of boyhood, a life I never had and will always dream of. This is the life I want for my children. MJ." [...] The book contained pictures of boys in various situations by different photographers, including pictures taken during the filming of the 1963 Lord of the Flies film and showed the boys on the set, usually clothed but sometimes nude, playing in the sand, reading comic books, and having pillow fights. The only book depicting male sex acts was a rare, out-of-print book called A Sexual Study of Man which featured many images of adult men engaged in all kinds of homosexual intercourse. [...] Robson said he would be concerned if the book's owner were to share his bed with a boy, but amended that he would not mind if he considered the total picture of all the material in question. [...] Robson testified that he believed Jackson had a [...] "sexual interest in women," [...] and that he had never seen [...] "anything that suggested pedophilia" [...] at Neverland. [...] Jackson's multiple residences were searched numerous times by various agencies over a period of days, without any child pornography ever being found. The FBI analyzed sixteen computers and found [...] "nothing notable" [...] contained in their files.|$|E
