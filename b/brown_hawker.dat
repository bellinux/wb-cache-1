5|$|The {{wings of}} dragonflies are {{generally}} clear, {{apart from the}} dark veins and pterostigmata. In the chasers (Libellulidae), however, many genera have areas of colour on the wings: for example, groundlings (Brachythemis) have brown bands on all four wings, while some scarlets (Crocothemis) and dropwings (Trithemis) have bright orange patches at the wing bases. Some aeshnids such as the <b>brown</b> <b>hawker</b> (Aeshna grandis) have translucent, pale yellow wings.|$|E

50|$|A. isoceles {{is one of}} {{only two}} <b>brown</b> <b>hawkers</b> found in Europe, the other is A. grandis. Both have a brown thorax and abdomen but A. isoceles has green eyes and clear wings and a {{diagnostic}} yellow triangular mark on the second abdominal segment. The hindwings have an amber patch at their base. In contrast A. grandis has yellowish wings and blueish eyes. The green eye of A. isoceles stand out even in flight and in practice {{it is not difficult to}} tell these two dragonflies apart. In addition to the morphological differences A. isoceles is on the wing much earlier in the year than A. grandis.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{supports}} {{large numbers}} of fly, snail, spider and beetle species.

There are diverse bird species, and flora such as rageed-robin, brooklime, common spotted orchid and creeping jenny. Dragonflies include the <b>brown</b> <b>hawker</b> and black-tailed skimmer.|$|E
50|$|Cole Mere is {{the only}} English site for the least water-lily. and the meadow {{in the spring and}} summer is perfect for flowers such as the {{southern}} marsh orchid, meadow cranesbill and lady’s smock. Insects are also abundant, including the <b>brown</b> <b>hawker</b> dragonfly and common blue damselfly.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{species of}} dragonflies and damselflies {{have been recorded}} at Black Lake: white-faced darter (Leucorrhinia dubia last recorded 1997), <b>brown</b> <b>hawker</b> (Aeshna grandis), four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata), common darter (Sympetrum striolatum), black darter (Sympetrum danae), large red damselfly (Pyrrhosoma nymphula) and common blue damselfly (Enallagma cyathigerum).|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>hawker</b> (Aeshna grandis) {{is a large}} {{dragonfly}} about 73 mm long. It is {{a distinctive}} species and is easily recognised, even in flight, by its brown body and bronze wings. At rest, blue spots on {{the second and third}} segments of the male's abdomen can be noticed; these are absent in female.|$|E

50|$|Fry {{of smooth}} newt was {{reported}} in 2000, the only amphibian reported by the lake. An inventory of damselflies in 1997 resulted in a list of emerald damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, variable damselfly, southern hawker, brilliant emerald, four-spotted chaser, eastern white-faced darter, and black darter. A second inventory in 2000 produced the following list interpreted as a normal amount of species: common hawker, <b>brown</b> <b>hawker,</b> Irish damselfly, variable damselfly, downy emerald, red-eyed damselfly, northern white-faced darter, brilliant emerald, and black darter.|$|E
50|$|As may be {{expected}} for such abundant flora, {{there is also a}} rich and diverse insect and reptile fauna present on the site. Typical meadow butterflies include for meadow brown (Maniola jurtina), common blue (Polyommatus icarus), small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), and the marsh fritillary (Eurodryas aurinia). Bordering hedges support gatekeeper (Pyronia tithonus), ringlet (Aphantopus hyperantus), and speckled wood (Pararge aegeria) butterflies. There are also 14 species of dragonfly recorded including the <b>brown</b> <b>hawker</b> (Aeshna grandis), black-tailer skimmer (Orthetrum cancellatum) and the ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum).

50|$|In recent years, Leicestershire County Council {{took over}} clay {{workings}} and coal pits in the Sence Valley between Ravenstone, Ibstock and Heather and later transferred {{them to the}} Forestry Commission, which reclaimed the area as the Sence Valley Forest Park. It contains woodland, lakes linked to the River Sence, grassland and a wild flower meadow. An artificial nesting wall for sand martins has also been constructed alongside Horseshoe Lake. In this varied habitat, 150 species of bird have been recorded. The lakes provide habitat for heron, coot, tufted duck, pochard, wigeon and great-crested grebe. Kestrels nest each year and, though less evident in daytime, there are barn owls and short-eared owls. Raptors, marsh, hen and Montague's harrier, osprey, red-footed falcon, merlin, peregrine and buzzard have all been seen. The bird list for the park currently stands at 101 species. Long grassy areas have become home for many wild mammals including field vole, shrew, stoat, rabbit and fox. Water voles are present on streams feeding the river. Otters too are once again using the river. Among the species of bats are pipistrelle, Daubenton's bat and noctule. Insects in summer include gatekeeper butterfly, meadow brown, speckled wood, small skipper, green-veined white, peacock butterfly and small tortoiseshell. Around the lakes, damselflies such as common blue, blue-tailed and azure as well as dragonflies such as the southern hawker and <b>brown</b> <b>hawker</b> are also fairly abundant.|$|E
