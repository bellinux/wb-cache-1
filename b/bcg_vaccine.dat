5|$|Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin {{achieved}} the first genuine success in immunization against tuberculosis in 1906, using attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis.

5|$|The <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> has limitations, and {{research}} {{to develop new}} TB vaccines is ongoing. A number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials. Two main approaches {{are being used to}} attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines. One approach involves adding a subunit vaccine to BCG, while the other strategy is attempting to create new and better live vaccines. MVA85A, an example of a subunit vaccine, currently in trials in South Africa, is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus. Vaccines are hoped to {{play a significant role in}} treatment of both latent and active disease.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{failure of}} current Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette–Guérin (<b>BCG)</b> <b>vaccines,</b> given to {{neonates}} {{to protect against}} adult tuberculosis {{and the risk of}} using these live vaccines in HIV-infected infants, has emphasized the need for generating new, more efficacious and safer replacement vaccines. With the availability of genetic techniques for constructing recombinant BCG (rBCG) strains containing well-defined gene deletions or insertions, new vaccine candidates are under evaluation at both the preclinical and clinical stages of development. Since most <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines</b> in use today were evaluated in clinical trials decades ago and are produced by outdated processes, the development of new <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines</b> offers a number of advantages that include a modern well-defined manufacturing process along with state-of-the-art evaluation of safety and efficacy in target populations. We provide a description of the preclinical development of two novel rBCGs, VPM 1002 that was constructed by adding a modified hly gene coding for the protein listeriolysin O (LLO) from Listeria monocytogenes and AERAS- 422, which carries a modified pfoA gene coding for the protein perfringolysin O (PFO) from Clostridium perfringens, and three genes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Novel approaches like these should be helpful in generating stable and effective rBCG vaccine candidates that can be better characterized than traditional <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the evolution, attenuation, and variable protective efficacy of bacillus Calmette–Guérin (<b>BCG)</b> <b>vaccines,</b> Mycobacterium bovis <b>BCG</b> Pasteur 1173 P 2 {{has been subjected}} to comparative genome and transcriptome analysis. The 4, 374, 522 -bp genome contains 3, 954 protein-coding genes, 58 of which are present in two copies as a result of two independent tandem duplications, DU 1 and DU 2. DU 1 is restricted to BCG Pasteur, although four forms of DU 2 exist; DU 2 -I is confined to early <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines,</b> like <b>BCG</b> Japan, whereas DU 2 -III and DU 2 -IV occur in the late vaccines. The glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase gene, glpD 2, is one of only three genes common to all four DU 2 variants, implying that BCG requires higher levels of this enzyme to grow on glycerol. Further amplification of the DU 2 region is ongoing, even within vaccine preparations used to immunize humans. An evolutionary scheme for <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines</b> was established by analyzing DU 2 and other markers. Lesions in genes encoding σ-factors and pleiotropic transcriptional regulators, like PhoR and Crp, were also uncovered in various BCG strains; together with gene amplification, these affect gene expression levels, immunogenicity, and, possibly, protection against tuberculosis. Furthermore, the combined findings suggest that early <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines</b> may even be superior to the later ones that are more widely used...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that C 57 BL/ 6, C 57 BL/ 10 and SJL mice are high {{responders}} to intravenously injected <b>BCG</b> cell-wall <b>vaccine</b> or oil-treated <b>BCG</b> organisms, whereas C 3 H, DBA/ 1 and DBA/ 2 mice are low responders. In a previous study, we found that C 3 H mice produced extensive lung granuloma when they were primed subcutaneously with <b>BCG</b> cell-wall <b>vaccine</b> and later rechallenged intravenously with the same vaccine. Now, we report that DBA/ 1 mice, but not DBA/ 2 mice, {{did not respond to}} intravenously challenged <b>BCG</b> cell-wall <b>vaccine,</b> even if this priming-rechallenging protocol is used. Thus, the low responders to the <b>BCG</b> cell-wall <b>vaccine</b> are divided into two groups. Breeding experiments using DBA/ 1 mouse as a parent suggest that an X-linked gene might control the responsiveness to <b>BCG</b> cell-wall <b>vaccine</b> in vivo...|$|R
25|$|According to the Ohio Department of Health and US Department of Health, the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (<b>BCG)</b> <b>vaccine</b> {{does not}} protect against TB infection. It does, though, give 80% of {{children}} protection against tuberculous meningitis and miliary tuberculosis. Therefore, a positive TST/PPD {{in a person}} who has received <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> is interpreted as latent TB infection (LTBI).|$|E

40|$|Recombinant bacille Calmette-Guerin (<b>BCG)</b> based <b>vaccine</b> {{delivery}} systems could potentially share {{the safety and}} effectiveness of BCG. We therefore prepared recombinant <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines</b> which expressed the L 1 late protein of the human papillomavirus (HPV) 6 b or the E 7 early protein of the HPV 16. The two recombinants were evaluated as immunogens in C 57 BL/ 6 J and BALB/c mice, and compared with a conventional protein/adjuvant system using E 7 or L 1 mixed with Quil-A adjuvant. rBCG 6 bL 1 and rBCG 16 E 7 primed specific immune responses, represented by DTH, T-proliferation and antibody, and rBCG 16 E 7 induced cytotoxic immune response to E 7 protein. The magnitude of the observed responses were less than those elicited by protein/adjuvant <b>vaccine.</b> As recombinant <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines</b> expressing HPV 6 bL 1 or HPV 16 E 7 persist at low levels in the immunised host, they may be beneficial to prime or retain memory responses to antigens, but {{are unlikely to be}} useful as a single component vaccine strategy.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that strong cellular or humoral immune responses can be induced against foreign antigens expressed by recombinant Mycobacterium bovis BCG. It has therefore been suggested that BCG could represent one of the best candidate vectors for live recombinant vaccines. However, {{a large percentage of the}} human population has been immunized by BCG, and this priming could modify the immune response to future recombinant <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines.</b> In the present study, we have therefore compared the immune responses induced in naive and BCG-primed mice by two recombinant <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines</b> expressing either beta-galactosidase or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef antigens. Our results demonstrated that BCG priming limits the growth of recombinant BCG in mouse spleen or lymph nodes. This reduction in BCG growth was associated with decreased proliferative responses against Nef or beta-galactosidase antigens. This suppression, however, never exceeded 50 %. Interestingly, in contrast to these reduced T-cell responses, BCG-primed mice developed high levels of anti-beta-galactosidase antibodies after immunization with recombinant BCG expressing this antigen. This stimulation of antibody responses was not due to polyclonal stimulation or to a nonspecific adjuvant effect of BCG. The isotypic patterns of anti-beta-galactosidase antibody responses induced by the recombinant BCG were similar in naive and BCG-primed mice. These results indicate that priming with BCG will not be a limitation for the use of recombinant <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines</b> in humans...|$|R

40|$|The {{protective}} effect of BCG vaccination is being evaluated {{in a controlled}} community trial near Madras in south India. After tuberculin and sensitin testing and radiographic and bacteriological examinations, <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines</b> and placebo were allocated randomly to about 260 000 individuals, of whom 115 000 were definitely tuberculin negative {{at the time of}} vaccination. Intensive efforts are being made, by means of regular follow-up surveys, to identify all new cases of tuberculosis occurring in the community. This report presents the findings of the first 7 ½ years of follow-up. Incidence of infection was high in the study population. However, incidence of bacillary disease was more frequent among initial tuberculin reactors, especially among the older persons, than among non-reactors of whom the majority were in the younger age groups.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of protective immunity to mycobacterial infection {{is critical for}} the development of effective strategies to control tuberculosis (TB), a major public health problem worldwide. Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) is a rare condition characterized by clinical disease caused by weakly virulent mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (<b>BCG)</b> <b>vaccines</b> and nontuberculous, environmental mycobacteria (EM) (OMIM 209950).

40|$|To further {{unravel the}} {{mechanisms}} responsible for attenuation of the tuberculosis <b>vaccine</b> Mycobacterium bovis <b>BCG,</b> comparative genomics {{was used to}} identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that differed between sequenced strains of Mycobacterium bovis and M. bovis BCG. SNPs were assayed in M. bovis isolates from France and the United Kingdom and from different <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{in order to identify}} those that arose during the attenuation process which gave rise to BCG. Informative data sets were obtained for 658 SNPs from 21 virulent M. bovis strains and 13 BCG strains; these SNPs showed phylogenetic clustering that was consistent with the geographical origin of the strains and previous schemes for BCG genealogies. The data revealed a closer relationship between BCG Tice and BCG Pasteur than was previously appreciated, while we were able to position BCG Beijing within a grouping of BCG Denmark-derived strains. Only 186 SNPs were identified between virulent M. bovis strains and all BCG strains, with 115 nonsynonymous SNPs affecting important functions such as global regulators, transcriptional factors, and central metabolism, which might impact on virulence. We therefore refine previous genealogies of <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccines</b> and define a minimal set of SNPs between virulent M. bovis strains and the attenuated BCG strain that will underpin future functional analyses...|$|R

Following the {{distribution}} of stocks of <b>BCG</b> to <b>vaccine</b> production laboratories around the world, {{it was only a}} few decades before different BCG producers recognized that there were variants of BCG, likely due to different passaging conditions in the different laboratories. This ultimately led to the lyophilization of stable BCG products in the 1950 s and 1960 s, but not before considerable evolution of the different BCG strains had taken place. The application of contemporary research methodologies has now revealed genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic differences between BCG strains. These molecular differences in part account for phenotypic differences in vitro between BCG strains, such as their variable secretion of antigenic proteins. Yet, the relevance of BCG variability for immunization policy remains elusive.
