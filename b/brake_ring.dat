5000|$|The vehicle's {{steering}} was direct to the axle, {{meaning the}} axle moved {{at the same}} rate as the steering handle. The other driver control was a switch that enabled the driver to move either forward or back at any speed, <b>brake,</b> <b>ring</b> the electric gong, and stop. There was also a foot brake to comply with the Board of Trade regulations.|$|E
50|$|A conical {{rotor brake}} motor {{incorporates}} the brake {{as an integral}} part of the conical sliding rotor. When the motor is at rest, a spring acts on the sliding rotor and forces the <b>brake</b> <b>ring</b> against the brake cap in the motor, holding the rotor stationary. When the motor is energized, its magnetic field generates both an axial and a radial component. The axial component overcomes the spring force, releasing the brake; while the radial component causes the rotor to turn. There is no additional brake control required.|$|E
50|$|The orbital wheel was {{designed}} in 1990 by Dominique Mottas of the French Osmos company {{in an attempt}} {{to reduce the number of}} moving parts by removing the center shaft and hub of the wheel and relying upon a circular rim inserted inside the wheel to support it instead. The orbital wheel was created by using two circular bearings inserted inside of each other. The inner bearing provides steering, support, and attachment to the frame. The outer bearing consists of a tire with a <b>brake</b> <b>ring</b> also fixed in. Some of the advantages seen by this design are more accurate steering, less weight, and enhanced braking.|$|E
50|$|Illumination grenade: {{equipped}} with a small parachute to suspend it in mid air while being used, its effective range is 600m with the <b>braking</b> <b>ring</b> and 1,500m without it.|$|R
50|$|A {{mark of the}} FV600's chassis' {{success was}} its {{application}} {{across a range of}} vehicles of varying weights and operational requirements, with great success at each and with little need for variation between them. One difference was in the braking system; the Saracen used drum <b>brakes,</b> the Saladin <b>ring</b> <b>brakes.</b> In time, the heavier Stalwart would require more effective disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|Another {{new feature}} was the Maybach-Olvar {{hydraulically}} controlled semi-automatic pre-selector gearbox. The extreme {{weight of the}} tank also required a new steering system. Germany's Argus Motoren, where Hermann Klaue had invented a <b>ring</b> <b>brake</b> in 1940, supplied them for the Arado Ar 96 and also supplied the 55 cm disc. Klaue acknowledged in the patent application that he had merely improved on existing technology, that {{can be traced back}} to British designs dating to 1904. It is unclear whether Klaue's patent <b>ring</b> <b>brake</b> was utilised in the Tiger brake design.|$|R
40|$|To {{substantially}} {{reduce the}} physical effort required to slow or stop a manually propelled wheelchair, the customary propulsion ring {{attached to the}} outer side of each main chair wheel is mounted on the wheel for limited inward axial movement under manual pressure and is biased outwardly by spring force. A <b>brake</b> <b>ring</b> of similar diameter near the interior side of each wheel in a plane parallel to the plane occupied by the propulsion ring is connected directly with the propulsion ring. An opposing friction brake shoe attached to the chair frame is engaged by the <b>brake</b> <b>ring</b> to slow or stop the chair whenever the chair occupant pushes the propulsion ring axially inwardly.

50|$|Toyota {{supplied}} {{a vehicle}} which was temporarily outfitted with hand <b>brake</b> and accelerator <b>ring</b> (the car {{was equipped with}} an automatic transmission and did not require a clutch controller).

40|$|Improvement in {{terminal}} {{accuracy is}} an important objective for future artillery projectiles. Generally it {{is often associated with}} range extension. Various concepts and modifications are proposed to correct the range and drift of artillery projectile like course correction fuze. The course correction fuze concepts could provide an attractive and cost-effective solution for munitions accuracy improvement. In this paper, the trajectory correction has been obtained using two kinds of course correction modules, one is devoted to range correction (drag <b>ring</b> <b>brake)</b> and the second is devoted to drift correction (canard based-correction fuze). The course correction modules have been characterized by aerodynamic computations and flight dynamic investigations in order to analyze the effects on deflection of the projectile aerodynamic parameters. The simulation results show that the impact accuracy of a conventional projectile using these course correction modules can be improved. The drag <b>ring</b> <b>brake</b> is found to be highly capable for range correction. The deploying of the drag brake in early stage of trajectory results in large range correction. The correction occasion time can be predefined depending on required correction of range. On the other hand, the canard based-correction fuze is found to have a higher effect on the projectile drift by modifying its roll rate. In addition, the canard extension induces a high-frequency incidence angle as canards reciprocate at the roll motion...|$|R
