50|$|In modern use, cavaletti {{are used}} {{not only for}} training, but also in some types of horse show {{competition}} such as trail horse classes for western riders, and very basic <b>beginning</b> <b>jumper</b> classes. They are not only used as jumps or ground rails, but {{can also be used}} to define corridors for training exercises or in trail horse or driving classes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Seeing Black Pussy {{over here}} yesterday, {{and knowing that}} to-day's lesson was to be about Yowler, I couldn't get cats {{out of my mind}} all day yesterday," [...] <b>began</b> <b>Jumper.</b> [...] "Black Pussy doesn't worry me, but I must confess that if there is any one I fear, it is Yowler the Bob Cat. Just {{thinking}} about him make me nervous. The more I {{tried not to think about}} him, the more I did think about him, and the more I thought about him, the more nervous I got. Then just before dark, on the bank of the Laughing Brook, I found some tracks in the mud. Those tracks were almost round, and that fact was enough to tell me who had made them. They were Yowler's footprints, and they hadn't been made very long.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Bloomberg <b>began</b> doing <b>jumpers</b> {{and won the}} USET Talent Derby in 2001.

50|$|His {{career as}} a <b>jumper</b> <b>began</b> with a remote ninth in a Novices' Hurdle at Exeter in October, {{although}} {{the fact that he}} was sent off 15/8 second favourite suggested than he had shown some potential. He was not seen on the course again for almost six months.|$|R
50|$|Carr's three-game {{sojourn in}} the Maroon <b>jumper</b> <b>began</b> {{off the bench}} in 1980, but didn't play as he wasn't called upon by coach John McDonald. He {{actually}} played in 1981. He was elevated to the starting XIII for {{the second and third}} games of the 1982 series. Carr played at lock forward as Queensland wrapped up the series with victories.Carr captained Souths Magpies to victory in the 1985 Brisbane Rugby League premiership, scoring a try against Wynnum-Manly in the grand final.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} a private inholding within the Angeles National Forest.Bungee jumping is {{provided}} by a private company. Jumpers typically meet at the main parking area for Heaton Flats Campground early in the morning, collecting at the Forest Service gate and then walking to the East Fork Trail trailhead where <b>jumpers</b> <b>begin</b> the hike generally as a group. After individuals jump from the bridge, people hike back either alone or in pairs or in groups, some times doing so after dark.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, he {{produced}} the mare Norvale. S{{he produced}} several foals, before competing internationally with Jean-Michael Gaud. Ibrahim's other progeny also began {{showing up at}} the international level: horses such as Petit Prince C and Quo Vadie. However, it was not until Tango C, a talented show <b>jumper,</b> <b>began</b> his competition career, that bookings to Ibrahim took off. From only a few bookings in 1966, he began by averaging 25 mares a year, before booking a record 54 mares 1969.|$|R
50|$|Six jumpers {{are hired}} {{annually}} to deliver mail {{on behalf of}} the United States Postal Service each summer from June 15 until September 15. Male jumpers were used until the first female was hired in 1974; the cruise line has hired women since. <b>Jumpers</b> <b>began</b> daily at 7 a.m. by sorting mail. Delivery begins at 10 a.m. aboard the U.S. Mailboat Walworth. Mail is delivered to about 60 houses and the delivery is completed by around 1 p.m. A typical jumper misses the jump returning to the boat once in her career and works {{the rest of the day}} wet.|$|R
5000|$|The Time <b>Jumpers</b> <b>began</b> as {{a garage}} {{practice}} session; the group started playing occasional gigs in the Nashville area {{until they were}} offered a regular slot playing at the Station Inn. In 2007, the group recorded a live album entitled Jumpin' Time. They were nominated for two Grammy awards, Best Country Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocals for the song [...] "Sweet Memories" [...] and Best Country Instrumental Performance for [...] "Fidoodlin'".

50|$|High quality show <b>jumpers</b> <b>began</b> to be {{imported}} from France and Germany, and the Karacabey breed was forgotten {{in favor of}} the exotic breeds. Another reason for its decline was competition from motor vehicles; the government decided there was no longer a need for this horse. The Karacabey Stud ceased all breeding of the Karacabey horse in 1980, and approximately 3,000 horses were sold at auction to the public. In a short time, crossed with other Turkish breeds, the Karacabey virtually disappeared, and today there are no Karacabey horses in Turkey. Ironically, almost as soon as the breed had vanished, the sport horse came to the fore as never before throughout the world, and Turkish officials deeply regretted the loss of this fine breed. Karacabey Stud now breeds the Arabian, Haflinger, and half-bred Halfinger.|$|R
60|$|Another party, under Christian, {{proceeded}} to some neighbouring rocks, and there, with sledge-hammer and crowbars, which they used as <b>jumpers,</b> <b>began</b> the laborious task of boring the solid rock, intending afterwards to blast, and partly to cut it, into large water-tanks. Quintal continued the thatching of his hut, in which work his humble wife aided him effectively. Brown proceeded with the planting operations {{which he had}} begun almost immediately after landing; and the women busied themselves variously, some in preparing the mid-day meal, some in gathering fruits and roots for future use, and others in improving the internal arrangements of their various huts, or in clearing away the debris of the late feast. As for little Sally, she superintended generally {{the work of the}} home department, and when she tired of that, went further afield in search of adventures.|$|R
50|$|Smoke <b>Jumpers</b> <b>begins</b> filming, {{but after}} several {{conflicts}} between Vince and director Verner Vollstedt (Stellan Skarsg√•rd), {{which leads to}} Verner firing Vince, production is halted by Ellis. The boys return to New York City, where Vince pursues a role in Gus Van Sant's new film. Eric persistently tries to convince Van Sant that Vince is right for the film, but Van Sant says not for his current film, but would love {{to work with him}} in the future. After discovering Van Sant said no, Vince becomes upset and fires Eric, believing that Eric had made him look desperate. A frustrated E returns to Hollywood to concentrate on another client, a young and rising comedian named Charlie (Bow Wow). Vince later apologizes after learning that Eric's persistence led to an offer by Martin Scorsese for a lead in his next feature, a re-envisioning of The Great Gatsby set in the Upper West Side of New York City. The guys return to Hollywood.|$|R
50|$|A {{static line}} is a cord {{attached}} at {{one end to the}} aircraft and at the other end {{to the top of the}} jumper's 'D-Bag' (Deployment Bag, into which the canopy is packed). The parachutist's fall from the aircraft causes the static line to become taut, this then pulls the D-Bag out of the container on the jumper's back. The static line and D-Bag stay with the aircraft as the jumper leaves, and is pulled back into the aircraft by the dispatcher. Now free of its D-Bag, the canopy is allowed to inflate as the jumper continues to fall. Effectively, the jumper drags the parachute behind him, causing the upward-rushing wind to force open and inflate the canopy. The canopy should inflate and <b>begin</b> supporting the <b>jumper</b> within 4 seconds. In the unlikely event of a malfunction, students are taught how to cut away the main canopy and deploy the reserve chute. The aim of static line progression is to train students to maintain the correct, stable body position upon exiting the aircraft, and to teach how to deploy the canopy via the pilot chute mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Strong {{appeals for}} a suicide barrier, fence, or other {{preventive}} measures were raised again by a well-organized vocal minority of psychiatry professionals, suicide barrier consultants, and families of <b>jumpers</b> <b>beginning</b> in January 2005. These efforts were given momentum by two films {{dealing with the}} topic of suicide and the Golden Gate Bridge. On January 14, 2005 the San Francisco Chronicle published an open letter by writer-director Jenni Olson calling for a suicide barrier on the Golden Gate Bridge. [...] The letter was, in part, {{an excerpt from the}} script of her film The Joy of Life, which world-premiered the following week, on January 20, 2005, at the Sundance Film Festival. The day before, on January 19, 2005, the Chronicle broke the news that filmmaker Eric Steel had been shooting suicide leaps from the bridge during 2004 for his film The Bridge, which would be released in 2006. A week later, The Joy of Life world-premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and video copies of the film were circulated to members of the Bridge District board of directors {{with the help of the}} Psychiatric Foundation of Northern California.|$|R
