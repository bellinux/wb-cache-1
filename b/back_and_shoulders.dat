25|$|A {{limitation}} of food sources {{in early spring}} and wild berry and nut crop failures during summer months may be contributing factors to black bears regularly feeding from commercial human-based food sources. Crops are frequently eaten by these bears, especially during autumn hyperphagia when natural foods are scarce. Favored crops may include apples, oats and corns. Black bears can do extensive damage {{in some areas of}} the northwestern United States by stripping the bark from trees and feeding on the cambium. Livestock depredations by black bears occur mostly in spring. Though black bears have the capacity to (and occasionally do) hunt adult cattle and horses, they seem to prefer smaller, more easily overwhelmed prey such as sheep, goats, calves, and pigs. They normally kill by biting the neck and shoulders, though they may break the neck or back of prey with blows from the paws. Evidence of a bear attack includes claw marks and is frequently found on the neck, <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> of larger animals. Surplus killing of sheep and goats are common. Bears have been known to frighten livestock herds over cliffs, causing injuries and death to many animals; {{whether or not this is}} intentional is not known. Occasionally, pets, especially dogs, which are most prone to harass a bear, are killed by black bears. It is not recommended to use unleashed dogs as a deterrent from bear attacks. Although large, aggressive dogs sometimes cause a bear to run, if pressed, angry bears frequently turn the tables and end up chasing the dog in return. A bear in pursuit of a pet dog has the potential to threaten both canid and human lives.|$|E

500|$|In a {{response}} to the record-breaking feats of Don Bradman, the English team that toured Australia in 1932–33—led by Douglas Jardine—adopted a tactic of fast, short pitched bowling directed at the body, later known as Bodyline. While Bodyline sought to curb Bradman, it was used against all the Australian batsmen, including Ponsford. After being bowled twice behind his legs—by Larwood for 32 in the first innings and for two in the second innings by Bill Voce—in the first Test at Sydney, Ponsford was omitted from the team for the second Test at Melbourne. Ponsford returned for the third Test in Adelaide, batting down the order. The Test was controversial and highly acrimonious; several Australian batsmen—including Woodfull and Bert Oldfield—were hit on the body and head from the English fast bowling. Ponsford was hit on several occasions during his innings of 85; he chose to turn his torso and take the rising balls on his body—especially on his left shoulder blade and backside—rather than risk a catch to the leg side fielders. When Ponsford returned to the dressing room after his dismissal, his teammates were amazed by the mass of bruises that covered his <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Ponsford remarked to Bill O'Reilly, [...] "I wouldn't mind having a couple more if I could get a hundred." ...|$|E

2500|$|Each {{horse is}} {{different}} regarding saddle fit, though minor {{problems can be}} compensated for with saddle blankets or pads. As a horse's muscles change with age or conditioning, one saddle may not fit during its entire life, and no saddle fits all horses. [...] A properly fitted saddle should have enough height in the gullet to clear the withers of the horse and not be so wide as to press on the spine, but not be so narrow as to pinch the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> of the horse. [...] It must not be so long in the tree that it interferes with the horse's hips, though a too-short tree may also create abnormal pressure points, particularly when it is {{too small for the}} rider as well. [...] Professional saddlers and saddle-fitters may be able to make small adjustments in better-quality saddles to help them better fit an individual horse, but the underlying structure of the saddle tree cannot be changed and must have an adequate fit from the outset.|$|E
2500|$|In the US, {{ready-to-wear}} {{sizes of}} dress shirts traditionally consist of two numbers [...] such as 15½34, {{meaning that the}} shirt has a neck [...] in girth (measured from centre of top button to centre of corresponding buttonhole) and a sleeve [...] long (measured from midpoint of the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> to the wrist). However, {{to reduce the number}} of sizes needed to be manufactured and stocked, an average sleeve length is sometimes given in the form 15½34/35 (indicating a neck [...] in girth and a [...] sleeve). Since the cuff frequently features two buttons, the cuff diameter can be reduced so that the cuff does not come down over the hand, allowing the shirt to fit the shorter length. Since the sleeve and neck size do not take into account waist size, some shirts are cut wide to accommodate large belly sizes. Shirts cut for flat stomachs are usually labeled, [...] "fitted", [...] "tailored fit" [...] "athletic fit" [...] or [...] "trim fit". The terms for fuller cut shirts are more varied ("Traditional", [...] "Regular" [...] etc.) and are sometimes explained on a shirt maker's website. Additionally, [...] "Portly" [...] or [...] "Big" [...] are often used for neck sizes of [...] or more. Very casual button-front shirts are often sized as small, medium, large, and so on. The meaning of these ad-hoc sizes is similarly not standardized and varies between manufacturers.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between exposure to pushing/pulling at work <b>and</b> low <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> complaints. Methods: A cross sectional questionnaire survey was carried out among 434 workers from several companies with mainly pushing/pulling tasks. From the same companies 188 workers without physically demanding tasks served as reference. The questionnaire {{was used to assess}} the exposure to pushing/pulling and other physical risk factors for low <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> complaints. Mean scores at company level were used to classify groups into medium and high exposed to pushing/pulling and a reference group. Psychosocial factors at work were also assessed. Several pain related questionnaires were used to assess the 12 month prevalence of low <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> complaints in three dimensions: trouble (ache, pain, discomfort), pain intensity, and disability. Prevalence rate ratios (PRs) were calculated using Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: The 12 month prevalence of low back complaints was almost equal for all three groups. The prevalence of shoulder complaints increased with an increase in exposure level. Adjusted PRs showed that the high exposed group had an increased risk for low back complaints compared to the reference group. For all dimensions of shoulder complaints a clear tendency towards a dose-response relation was observed. The high exposed group had significant PRs for shoulder complaints, ranging from 2. 09 to 6. 37. Generally, psychosocial factors had a confounding effect for pain intensity and disability, but not for trouble. Conclusions: For shoulder complaints a dose-response relation was observed for exposure to pushing/pulling. Low back complaints were less consistently associated with pushing/pulling. Stronger associations were observed for more severe cases of low <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> complaints. It is hypothesised that work related psychosocial factors affect these associations...|$|R
