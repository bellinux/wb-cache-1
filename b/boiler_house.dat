5|$|Rents {{were set}} {{based on the}} income of the occupant. Transient {{visitors}} to Los Alamos were accommodated in the Fuller Lodge, the Guest Cottage or the Big House, which had once {{been part of the}} Los Alamos Ranch School. A school was established in 1943, catering for both grade school and high school, and 140 children were enrolled; 350 by 1946. Education was free, as was a nursery school for working mothers. With 18 grade-school teachers, 13 high-school teachers, and a superintendent, it enjoyed an excellent teacher:pupil ratio. Numerous technical buildings were constructed. Most were of a semi-permanent type, using gypsum board. They were heated from a central heating plant. Initially this was <b>Boiler</b> <b>House</b> No. 1, which had two coal-fired boilers. This was replaced by <b>Boiler</b> <b>House</b> No. 2, which had six oil-fired boilers. In addition to the main site at Los Alamos, some 25 outlying sites were developed for experimental work.|$|E
5|$|They include reusing part of {{the station}} {{building}} as a power station, fuelled by biomass and waste. The station's existing chimneys would be utilised for venting steam. The former turbine halls would be converted to shopping spaces, and the roofless <b>boiler</b> <b>house</b> used as a park. An energy museum would also be housed inside the former station building. The restoration of the power station building would cost £150 million.|$|E

5000|$|The {{station was}} {{designed}} by the British electrical engineering consultants, Merz & McLellan. The station's design set the pattern for power station layout and design {{for most of the}} early twentieth century, as it was the first in the world to use the [...] "unit system" [...] of layout, whereby each boiler and turbine generating set is directly connected electrically to an alternator, and can work independently from any other generating unit in the station. This system has remained popular throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century. The station's <b>boiler</b> <b>houses</b> and turbine hall were of steel frame construction clad with corrugated iron, with the <b>boiler</b> <b>houses</b> built at right angles to the turbine hall. Each of the three <b>boiler</b> <b>houses</b> had its own chimney. This layout allowed for long lengths of steam-piping to be avoided, and for each battery of boilers to be arranged opposite the generating set which it feeds in the turbine hall.|$|R
5|$|In 1925, NESCo set up {{separate}} {{plant at}} the power station for the low temperature carbonisation treatment of coal, before being burned in boilers and the steam used for electricity generation. The treatment plant was manufactured by Babcock & Wilcox, and {{set up in a}} self-contained <b>boiler</b> <b>house</b> which contained four boilers, four retorts and pulverising mills. The building was also fitted with gas-stripping and by-product plants. The carbonising plant could handle up to 100 tonnes of coal per day, while its boilers produced 78,000lb of steam per hour. This plant was extended in 1931.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 it {{was decided}} to {{preserve}} the two remaining engines and incorporate them as the central feature in the Visitor Centre, including a Museum in the old <b>boiler</b> <b>house,</b> which opened in 1988 and attracts over 30,000 visitors a year. The flywheel is now driven by an electric motor. The pumping station is now a Grade II* listed building, while the gothic-style meter house is Grade II listed and used as a bat sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|In Newhey is the Ellenroad Steam Museum, the {{retained}} engine house, <b>boiler</b> <b>house,</b> chimney {{and steam}} engine of Ellenroad Mill, a former 1892-built cotton mill designed by Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet. Now operated as an industrial heritage centre, the mill itself {{is no longer}} standing, but the steam engine (the world's largest working steam mill engine) is maintained and steamed once a month by the Ellenroad Trust. The museum has the only fully working cotton mill engine with its original steam-raising plant in the world. Ellenroad Mill produced fine cotton yarn using mule spinning.|$|E

5|$|The station {{consists}} of a parallel <b>boiler</b> <b>house</b> and turbine hall, which creates a large double-gabled building. It is of steel frame construction with brick cladding. Other features include round-headed openings and ridge ventilators. This building originally housed the station's boilers and turbo generators. Constructed alongside the station was a brick built chimney, to remove gasses from the boilers. The station was first brick built power station in North East England, with corrugated iron being the usual material used prior to this.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, administrators Ernst & Young {{entered into}} an {{exclusivity}} agreement with Malaysia's SP Setia and Sime Darby {{to develop the}} site. The £400 million sale was completed in September 2012, and the redevelopment intends to implement the Rafael Vinoly design, which had gained planning consent from Wandsworth Council in 2011. In January 2013, the first residential apartments went on sale. Construction on Phase 1 was due to commence in 2013, with completion due in 2016/17. Apple will locate its new London headquarters at Battersea Power Station, becoming the largest office tenant with 1,400 staff across six floors in the central <b>boiler</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
5|$|The station's <b>boiler</b> <b>house</b> housed three {{coal-fired}} Lancashire boilers, each of 200 HP {{capacity and}} each with individual economisers. These boilers provided steam for two 410 kilowatt (kW) and one 150kW direct current Parsons turbo generators. This gave the station a total generating capacity of 970kW. Before {{being used in}} the Lemington power station, these generators had been used in Forth Banks Power Station and in Newburn Steelworks. One of the steam turbines from these sets is now on display at the Electric Power and Historical Museum in Yokohama, Japan, after sitting on display in the entrance to Blyth Power Station for many years.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the first}} phase, the A Station, began in March 1929. The main {{building}} work {{was carried out by}} John Mowlem & Co, and the structural steelwork erection carried out by Sir William Arrol & Co. Other contractors were employed for specialist tasks. Most of the electrical equipment, including the steam turbine turbo generators, was produced by Metropolitan-Vickers in Trafford Park, Manchester. The building of the steel frame began in October 1930. Once completed, the construction of the brick cladding began, in March 1931. Until the construction of the B Station, the eastern wall of the <b>boiler</b> <b>house</b> was clad in corrugated metal sheeting as a temporary enclosure. The A Station first generated electricity in 1933, but was not completed until 1935. The total cost of its construction was £2,141,550. Between construction beginning in 1929 and 1933, there were six fatal and 121 non-fatal accidents on the site.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was installed}} in 1938 and an outer door for the north porch added in 1962. Major renovations were carried out from 1981 to 1983; these comprised repairs to the north aisle roof and the east tower, plastering and limewashing of the chancel, replacement of the old electrical and heating systems, and minor work on the organ. The most recent round of restoration was the 2000 reflooring of the nave, installation of a vestry, toilet and kitchen, a new heating system with a detached <b>boiler</b> <b>house,</b> and reglazing of the north porch. Because of the remoteness of the altar from the congregation, a second altar was erected between the parclose screens (extensions forward from {{the ends of the}} rood screen) to enable a more intimate celebration of the Eucharist. St Nicholas was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1959, which recognizes it as a building of exceptional interest.|$|E
5|$|The station's <b>boiler</b> <b>house</b> houses three 380MWth International Combustion boilers, {{which are}} fuelled by {{pulverised}} bituminous coal. Each of these provide steam {{for one of}} three 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420MW. The electricity generated was fed at 24 kilovolt (kV) to a substation to power the smelter during operation. The substation also has a 132kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310MW of the 420MW that the power station produces, so the excess 110MW which was fed into the national grid. Since the mothballing of the smelter, all exports now go to the grid.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: On {{the basis}} of audit surveys {{concerning}} modernization of heating systems in middle-sized towns (of 16 to 65 thousand inhabitants), a technical-economic analysis {{as well as an}} ecological analysis of feasible investment projects were performed. The audit surveys concentrated mainly on 152 local low-temperature <b>boiler</b> <b>houses</b> with low emission sources in selected towns of the north-eastern Poland. The audit surveys mentioned above involved also measurements of the amounts of SO 2 and particulate matter polluting the air. The fundamental purpose of the suggested modernization of the researched heating systems was to improve the very low operating efficiency of the <b>boiler</b> <b>houses</b> (mainly with low emission sources) under concern, as well as-or perhaps above all- to reduce levels of SO 2 and particulate matter polluting the air. One of the criteria applied in the economic assessment of the suggested projects (investments) was the Net Present Value (NPV), whereas {{in the case of the}} ecological assessment- reducing air pollution...|$|R
500|$|The main visible {{features}} of the stations were their large <b>boiler</b> <b>houses,</b> turbine halls, cooling towers and pairs of chimneys; other facilities on both sites included offices, coal sorting areas, small fire stations and workshops.

5|$|Station 2 was {{constructed}} in the 1920s and considered significant as a rare surviving example of early 20th-century industrial architecture. It was designed in an industrial Beaux-Arts style, with large arched windows and stringcourse intended {{to prevent it from}} becoming an eyesore given its proximity to affluent communities. It {{was constructed}} with Flemish bond brickwork and decorative limestone elements. It was also constructed to minimize noise and ash pollution. Buildings with such architectural detail were usually found in urban areas, making the Glenwood plant unusual for being far from urban areas {{at the time of its}} construction. The building was divided into three sections: a narrow four-story administration section to the north containing offices; a five-story turbine room containing a large open space with decorated glazed buff brick walls; and a six-story <b>boiler</b> <b>house</b> mainly filled with equipment, topped by six 140-foot smoke stacks (ultimately reaching 265 feet above the floor slab). At the time of its demolition the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that it appeared to meet the criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, triggering an alternative use analysis. Given the building's poor condition after three decades of disuse, the excessive cost of making the building structurally sound prevented any plans to retain or renovate it.|$|E
25|$|Steam power came to {{the mill}} in three major {{building}} phases. In 1865 a beam engine house was built, together with a <b>boiler</b> <b>house</b> and the first chimney on the site. In the 1890s a second beam engine arrived, the <b>boiler</b> <b>house</b> was extended and the existing chimney built, and then in 1910 the existing horizontal engine was fitted, the Green's economiser house added and the <b>boiler</b> <b>house</b> extended again.|$|E

When completed the adjoining <b>boiler</b> <b>houses</b> totalled 255 yards and the entire buildings and chimneys used several million bricks. It is estimated that the six chimneys alone used at least 8 million bricks. By 1937 the station supplied a maximum load of 101,800 kW of electricity.|$|R
25|$|Carnival of Screams was a scare maze that debuted for the 2010 Scarefest event. During {{its debut}} it {{shared the same}} {{temporary}} building as the <b>Boiler</b> <b>House.</b> John Wardley contributed {{to the development of}} Carnival of Screams, which was entered through a large clown face with horrific features. For 2011 it and the <b>Boiler</b> <b>House</b> were relocated to the X-Sector area. The maze is a mixture of humor and serious scares, and the music used is the former Toy Land Tours attraction theme music warped for dramatic effect. From 2012 onwards, the attraction was situated opposite the hospitality suite, with the exit inside the Goal Striker unit. In 2013 and its final incarnation, the maze gained a theatrical ending involving a knife thrower.|$|E

40|$|Project aim was {{to reduce}} {{pollution}} levels in the City of Krakow through the retirement of coal-fired (hand and mechanically-stoked) <b>boiler</b> <b>houses.</b> This was achieved by identifying attractive candidates and connecting them to the Krakow district heating system, thus permitting them to eliminate boiler operations. Because coal is less costly than district hot water, the district heating company Miejskie Przedsiebiorstwo Energetyki Cieplnej S. A., henceforth identified as MPEC, needed to provide potential customers with incentives for purchasing district heat. These incentives consisted of offerings which MPEC made to the prospective client. The offerings presented the economic and environmental benefits to district heating tie-in and also could include conservation studies of the facilities, so that consumption of energy could be reduced and the cost impact on operations mitigated. Because some of the targeted <b>boiler</b> <b>houses</b> were large, {{the capacity of the}} district heating network required enhancement at strategic locations. Consequently, project construction work included both enhancement to the district piping network as well as facility tie-ins. The process of securing new customers necessitated the strengthening of MPEC`s competitive position in Krakow`s energy marketplace, which in turn required improvements in marketing, customer service, strategic planning, and project management. Learning how US utilities address these challenges became an integral segment of the project`s scope...|$|R
