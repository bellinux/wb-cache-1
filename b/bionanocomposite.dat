Three thermo-mechanical cycles at 50  % of deformation were performed in order to check the thermally-activated shape memory ability of the <b>bionanocomposites</b> and to determine the shape memory parameters, namely the strain fixity (Rf), and the strain recovery (Rr) ratio. Both <b>bionanocomposites,</b> with neat and functionalized cellulose nanocrystals, present excellent shape memory behaviour maintaining the recovery behaviour at values of about 90  % as measured previously for the pure matrix, indicating that the addition of the nanofiller maintains the good ability to recover the initial shape of the matrix.

The SW-CH <b>bionanocomposites</b> were good adsorbents for the herbicide at pH levels where both the anionic form of the herbicide (pK a= 2. 3) and the cationic form of CH (pK a= 6. 3) predominated. The performance of the SW-CH <b>bionanocomposites</b> as adsorbents of clopyralid depended on the amount and arrangement of chitosan in the samples. Clopyralid adsorption was rapid and mostly linear up to herbicide concentrations as high as 0. 5 mM. High salt concentrations (0. 1 M NaCl) promoted desorption of the adsorbed pesticide from SW-CH, strongly suggesting that adsorption of clopyralid occurred primarily through an ion exchange mechanism on positively charged CH sites at the montmorillonite surface. Amendment of an acidic soil (pH= 4. 5) with SW-CH at rates of 5 % and 10 % led to a significant increase in clopyralid adsorption, whereas this effect was negligible when SW-CH was added to an alkaline soil (pH= 8. 0), reflecting the absence of positively charged sites in SW-CH at high pH values.

This location resulted in a marked improvement of the physical and mechanical properties of the system. Moreover, these properties can be controlled {{as a function of}} the nanofiller nature and the mixing procedure used...|$|E
40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to improve the thermal, {{mechanical}} and optimal properties of an epoxy bioresin using optimum hybrid natural pigments previously synthesised in our lab. Next, we searched for the best combinations of factors in the synthesis of natural hybrid nanopigments and then incorporated them into the bioresin. We combined three structural modifiers in the nanopigment synthesis, surfactant, coupling agent (silane) and a mordant salt (alum), selected to replicate mordant textile dyeing with natural dyes. We used Taguchi’s design L 8 to seek final performance optimisation. We selected three natural dyes, chlorophyll, beta-carotene and beetroot extract, and used two laminar nanoclay types, montmorillonite and hydrotalcite. The thermal, mechanical and colorimetric characterisation of the composite obtained by mixing natural hybrid nanopigments (<b>bionanocomposite)</b> was made. The natural dye interactions with both nanoclays improved the thermal stabilities, colour performance and UV–VIS light exposure stability of natural dyes and bioresins. The best <b>bionanocomposite</b> materials were found in an acidic pH [3, 4] environment and by modifying nanoclays with mordant and surfactant during the nanopigment synthesis process.

40|$|Magnetic (FePt) and {{nonmagnetic}} (Au) nanoparticles {{were used}} to assemble ferritin into near-monodisperse <b>bionanocomposites</b> featuring regular interparticle spacing. The FePt/ferritin assemblies are integrated magnetic materials with ferritin providing added magnetic volume fraction to the magnetic nanocomposite.

40|$|<b>Bionanocomposites</b> of {{thermoplastic}} starch (TPS) {{reinforced with}} microfibrilated cellulose (MFC) were prepared by melt processing. MFC was prepared from eucalyptus wood pulp {{by a process}} combining cryogenic milling in high shear mixers, chemical treatment with sodium hydroxide and ultrasound treatment. The never dried MFC was then dispersed in native starch and glycerol and processed in a single screw extruder. Two MFC contents were incorporated, 3 and 10 wt %, based on TPS. The MFC was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The <b>bionanocomposites</b> were characterized by tensile tests, SEM and water absorption experiments. Modulus and tensile strength were improved. Water absorption did not change in an appreciable way {{with the addition of}} MFC. The homogeneous dispersion of the MFC into TPS matrix can be considered one of the remarkable points of the new process used in the composite preparation...|$|R
40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 14 - 19 <b>Bionanocomposites</b> {{films of}} cassava starch {{plasticized}} with sucrose and inverted sugar and reinforced by cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were prepared by solution casting method incorporating 0. 1 to 5 wt% of eucalyptus CNCs. The nanocrystals were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, whereas the <b>bionanocomposites</b> properties were studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, tensile measurements, water solubility, swelling behavior, and water activity (aw). The water resistance properties (solubility and swelling behavior) of the nanocomposites were enhanced {{with the addition}} of cellulose nanofillers. These results were explained in terms of the high crystallinity of the nanocrystals and the formation of a rigid network with the nanofillers, which provide physical barriers to the permeation of water within the hydrophilic cassava matrix. The addition of CNCs in the <b>bionanocomposites</b> decreases aw linearly, reaching values below 0. 5 (for CNCs concentration higher than 4 wt%), a reference value for no microbial proliferation for food product design. The presence of small concentrations of CNCs (0. 1 – 0. 3 wt%) also effectively increased the maximum tensile strength (more than 90 %) and elastic modulus (more than 400 %), indicating the formation of a suitable percolation network in this concentration range. Because the cellulose nanofillers enhanced the mechanical and water stability properties of the nanocomposites, the obtained results in this work may be applied to the development of biodegradable packaging or coatings to enhance shelf life of food products...|$|R
