5000|$|Suzuki {{introduced}} the SV650 in 1999 as a <b>budget</b> <b>entry</b> {{in the emerging}} naked bike market and featured both naked and fully faired versions. [...] The bike provided a sporty though easily manageable ride. The combination of light weight, rigid chassis, strong handling, and the V-twin's strong mid-range torque appealed to beginner and experienced riders alike. The 2003 SV1000 was marketed it as a bigger alternative to the second generation SV650.|$|E

50|$|While Bhutanese {{citizens}} {{are free to}} travel abroad, Bhutan is viewed as inaccessible by many foreigners. Another reason for it being an unpopular destination is the cost, which is high for tourists on tighter <b>budgets.</b> <b>Entry</b> is free for citizens of India, Bangladesh, and the Maldives, but all other foreigners are required to sign up with a Bhutanese tour operator and pay around US$250 per day that they stay in the country, though this fee covers most travel, lodging and meal expenses. Bhutan received 37,482 visitor arrivals in 2011, of which 25% were for meetings, incentives, conferencing, and exhibitions.|$|R
50|$|After {{the launch}} of the new Rover 200 in October 1989, the Maestro was repositioned as a <b>budget</b> <b>entry</b> level model, with only the base {{specification}} models remaining in production while the MG variants were discontinued in 1991. Production had peaked at more than 101,000 units in 1983, and as late as 1989 nearly 60,000 were made. Most sales were in the United Kingdom, where it peaked as the sixth best selling car with more than 80,000 sales in 1984, but by 1989 sales had halved and it was the 19th best seller.|$|E
50|$|PSPPs offer {{not only}} {{opportunities}} but also bring risks, {{especially for the}} state partner (and their <b>budget).</b> <b>Entry</b> into a PSPP {{on the part of}} the state is based on the expectation that additional resources can be generated or mobilized in order to increase the scope of public social services.Due to the responsibilities of the state, the state partner must carefully evaluate what is made the subject of a PSPP - with whom, for how long and under what conditions. Long-term effects must be anticipated. The evaluation process needs comprehensive, long-term and operational criteria, quality assurance, a political decision and a critical analysis of the PSPP as to its suitability as an instrument for the intended purpose. For public institutions, a PSPP can increase the room for manoeuvre, but this process must not take place at the expense of erosion or abdication of responsibility by the state authority. The state must be careful not to surrender control of activities over which it is democratically mandated to exercise adequate control. This issue is the subject of extensive discussions as it applies to PPPs: the growing influence of private actors and the correspondingly retreating influence of the state (see e.g. B. Pölzl/Preisch 2003: 41).This makes it all the more important to emphasize that PSPP models should only be supported by the state in cases where they serve the long-term social needs of disadvantaged members of society. This responsibility belongs to the state and the state only.|$|E

40|$|The {{ordinary}} political landscape, {{with particular}} reference to so-called “consolidated democracy”, {{has produced a}} series of phenoma for example the mistrust of citizens towards their representatives, which emphasize an alarming gap not only between {{the political and social}} characteristics that shape democracies, but also between descriptive and normative meanings of the same regimes. In such democratic regimes, many scholars have underlined a progressive crisis in quality, which can be summarized as the emerging of a post-democratic model (Crouch, 2005), the presence of “rhetorical democracies” (Canfora, 2007) or “the failing to keep their democratic promises” (Bobbio, 1995). If we consider these last sentences and the progressive degeneration of Western democratic regimes, several authors, like Patenam (1970), Macpherson (1980), Barber (1984), and the more recent Habermas (1997), Dryzek (1990), Ackerman (1991) and Gutmann (2002), have expressed their theoretical schemes which are based on the concepts of participation and deliberation. In such a climate, Participatory Budgeting {{can be seen as a}} democratic instrument able to provide new ways of involving citizens to participate in the definition of the local political agenda and the ensuing of public policies. By starting a deliberative process among representatives, citizens and local institutions focused on the main <b>budgeting</b> <b>entries,</b> this instrument has been able to generate positive effects not only in the governance dimension, but chiefly in the system of values and inside the prescriptive meanings that built the concept of democracy. Among the five dimensions used by the framework to evaluate a democratic innovation participation, deliberation, effectiveness, enlightenment and legitimacy- our analysis focalizes upon the first four ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} projects and programs that will assist the Indian Health Service (IHS) and Tribes in improving communication and administration of programs provided by both groups. This includes factors such as who should provide the services, what services should be provided, and how they should be provided. The scope of this program was the Billings Area Office, which is comprised of seven Indian Health Boards. A unit by unit evaluation of the costs and services provided, was performed in a managerial manner. Input from each of the seven Tribal boards was presented in a short narrative, along with tables and line item <b>budget</b> <b>entries.</b> Graphs were also provided to show how each of the seven tribes fared in terms of funding, services provided, expressed needs, and involvement by the Tribal board. For the seven Tribes served by the Billings Area Office, there was a lack of the following: 1) psychiatric foster and/or home care; 2) burn care unit; 3) chemical dependency unit; and 4) alcoholism out-patient or in-patient services. Funding and expenditures were not controlled by the Tribal Boards. The final observation addressed the reluctance of the Montana Indian Health Board to obtain new contractors or suppliers for the Tribal boards, totally ignoring the problems reported. The most effective board would be one consisting of community and Tribal members, ensuring a fair representation of the population. There is a need for an advocate with a background in contract health services to meet with IHS on a more equal basis. IHS must be more willing to open the books for evaluation by the Tribal boards. In addition, Indians should lobby Congress for more control of the monies allocated for Indian health care...|$|R
50|$|If Butler’s {{motorcycle}} racing {{was conducted}} on a “shoe-string” <b>budget,</b> his <b>entry</b> into Sprint Car racing was seemingly hopeless—he was attempting to enter an advanced class of auto racing with no money and no prior auto racing experience. He was also nearly 25 years old and the sport was tilting towards very young drivers; {{in just a few}} years Jeff Gordon would begin his own sprint car career at age 13. Undaunted, Butler jumped in with both feet by selling all of his race bikes and his transport van (his only personal transportation). When liquidating his assets was insufficient to buy a sprint car, he convinced his future wife, Thomasa Brock, to help him obtain a loan using her own home as collateral. This provided enough money to buy a beat-up old Sprint Car.|$|R
40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that if inappropriate decisions are made by developers in the initial establishment phase of multi-owned residential schemes, conflict and long-term dysfunctionalism for the eventual owners result. This paper maps out practises commonly utilised by developers in establishing staged, multi-owned residential developments and the consequences that these practises can have on a scheme in the short and long-term. Findings stemming from twelve semi-structured interviews conducted with key strata and community title industry experts from around Australia are reported. It appears {{there are a number}} of practises, including; inappropriate <b>budget</b> setting, <b>entry</b> into inappropriate long-term contracts, and retention of majority voting power which can affect the viability and functionality of a scheme and also incite conflict for many years following cessation of the developer’s formal involvement with a scheme.

In recruitment decisions, incumbent members trade off the effect of entry on average faculty status against alternative uses of the recruitment <b>budget</b> if no <b>entry</b> takes place. We show that the best candidates join the best faculties but that they receive lower wages than some lesser ranking candidates. We also study the allocation of surplus created by the entry of a new faculty member and show that faculties with symmetric status distributions maximize their joint surplus under majority voting...|$|R

We show that the best candidates join the best faculties but that they receive lower wages than some lower-ranking candidates. We argue that in a second-best world majority voting is a good approximation to maximizing aggregate faculty surplus.

Are these regulations desirable? This paper studies contribution caps in a menu auction lobbying model with limited <b>budgets</b> and costly <b>entry.</b> In the absence of entry, contribution caps improve welfare by "leveling the political playing field". With entry, however, a competition effect and a bargaining effect may arise, resulting in inefficient entry and exit decisions. In particular, a cap may lead to worse policies than the status quo; and even if better policies are chosen, the resulting gain in welfare {{may be more than}} offset by the entry costs. Regulation can also lead to the simultaneous entry of competing groups, creating costly rent-seeking on issues previously unaffected by lobbying.

40|$|Modern {{trends in}} {{regional}} {{economic development in}} Russia are characterized by dynamic structural changes and lead to the clusters formation. Claster is a specific form of the spatial organization of industries and services, that are considered {{as a tool for}} innovation policy aimed at stabilizing the rate of economic growth. The concept of innovation clusters development represents a new approach to the structural development of the national economy in general. It is based on the nonlinear nature of the economic processes development in the region, especially in the transition to innovative development. Clusters are considered as the most mature form of the organization of innovative production that will support economic growth. Moreover, the operation of innovative enterprises in clusters offers great opportunities to create and develop their competitive advantage. Innovation policy is a system of rules and regulations governing the procedure of innovation implementation, both in technology and in the technology management in accordance with the strategic direction of economic development. The main task of innovation policy ? to achieve the maximum possible degree of interests harmonization among participants of innovation process. To solve this problem there are used special tools to ensure efficient usage of area resources - clusters. Innovation policy, based on clusters, requires two complementary strategies: 1. strategy to ensure the efficient use and dissemination of knowledge; 2. strategy aimed at creating scientific and innovative networks within the cluster. Clusters formation enables to take advantage of them for the implementation of regional innovation policy, that increases the efficiency of small innovative businesses, rises tax revenues to the regional <b>budget,</b> reduces <b>entry</b> barriers for small-scale innovative companies to the markets of raw material suppliers and product market, improves financial stability of companies and reduces costs of production, creates opportunities for accessing foreign markets and attracting qualified staff. Cluster initiatives in Russian regions interconnected with the strategy and innovation policy. Therefore, innovation policy of regions in Russia is not an adopted result of theoretical model of successful cluster initiatives, but it is a composite of various measures, and we can mark a significant specificity of regional innovation policies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates how {{the eight}} state-funded New Zealand {{universities}} present {{themselves in the}} prospectuses they publish yearly. The background for this research {{is the fact that}} the universities now have to compete for students and funding monies because the government has linked the amount of funding to the number of students and the universities’ success in research (McKenzie, 1996). Additionally, student fees and private sources increasingly contribute to the universities’ <b>budget.</b> The <b>entry</b> of competition into the tertiary education sector is a result of recent policy changes that led the education sector from an egalitarian scholarly system with a tradition of open and free access for all citizens to a market-oriented education industry, which contributes considerably to the national economy. This restructuring of the tertiary education sector is part of the major social, political and economic changes that New Zealand went through – and is still going through – beginning with the Fourth Labour Government's second term of office from 1987 to 1990 (Holland & Boston, 1990). The historical background of this thesis focuses on these policy changes that influenced all areas of the public life in New Zealand in the last 25 years. The literature review established that these reforms resulted in processes of commodification of education, competitive marketisation and corporatisation of the universities (Butterworth & Tarling, 1994). The purpose of this thesis is to find evidence of these three tendencies within the language and visual presentation of the university prospectuses. The prospectuses have been chosen as the data corpus because they provide a comprehensive overview of the institutions. Moreover, they represent a hybrid genre of an advertorial text type, being partly informational, partly promotional. The data has been analysed by applying textually-oriented discourse analysis (Fairclough, 1992). Discourse analysis has been proven to be a suitable methodology as it links linguistic analysis to the broader social context. The premise of this approach was that social changes leave traces within the discourse. The data analysis confirmed the intended outcome that the tendencies of commodification, marketisation and corporatisation are visible in the present material. This concludes that the order of discourse of business has colonised the order of discourse of tertiary education...|$|R
