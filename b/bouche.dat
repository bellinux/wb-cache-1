5000|$|Meagan Garvey of MTV {{referenced}} {{the song}} {{as an example}} of [...] "Eurodance Nostalgia" [...] and that the cult status of the song is [...] "mostly retroactive". Garvey stated that songs such as [...] "Better Off Alone", [...] "left you with an aching sensation, as if something had been left unsaid. The undercurrent of melancholy seemed more akin to mid-’90s tracks like La <b>Bouche’s</b> “Where Do You Go” or Haddaway’s “What Is Love,” dance tracks built around unanswerable questions." ...|$|R

Some other diners, fellow crooks, ask Max if he thinks it is true, as the papers say, that Angelo was the thief; Max evades the question. Pierrot telephones to tell Max that Riton has died. Max has the roast beef.|$|R

Sir Reginald departs to her base on a train, but Jenabell's agent sabotages it. Nevertheless, Argoman arrives in time to save general Headwood from cloning. Superhero destroys other clones along with Jenabell's. The real Jenabell flees with [...] "Muradoff A IV" [...] on a plane. Argoman telekinetically turns the plane to {{the sun and the}} gem reflects its light, killing Jenabell in an explosion. As a souvenir for this case, Argoman takes the Royal Crown.|$|R

40|$|Populations of <b>Bouché’s</b> star of Bethlehem (Ornithogalum boucheanum (Kunth) Asch., fam. Hyacinthaceae) were {{recorded}} on Bansko Hill (Baranja, Croatia) in 2007. Since this species {{has not been}} previously confirmed in Croatia, it {{should be treated as}} a new taxon in the country and included in the Flora Croatica Database. In this paper we present a short morphological description of O. boucheanum and diagnostic morphological characters for differentiation from the related O. nutans L. We suggested O. boucheanum be evaluated as a critically endangered (CR) species of the Croatian flora, considering the small number of individuals and the small extension of its population. The recording of its populations {{on the edge of the}} loess cliff in Bansko Hill a part of which belongs to the Important Plant Area and Natura 2000, confirms the significance of this unique habitat in preserving rare and endangered plants...|$|R
25|$|Jenny Lind {{was then}} the London rage, and Cruvelli now {{appeared}} as the Countess to Lind's Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro, with Lablache, Coletti, Belletti and <b>Bouche,</b> and with Mlle Schwartz as Cherubino. Later that season Cruvelli sang Abigaille in Nabucco. Eugenia Tadolini was also making her debut, but did not maintain the foothold in London which Cruvelli achieved. 'It was difficult, indeed almost impossible, both for Cruvelli and Tadolini to shed their really bright rays, whilst the great planet Jenny Lind was in the ascendant.' The whole season culminated in Lind's Farewell.|$|E
25|$|Within {{six months}} of coming into ownership, the King began his own {{rebuilding}} and expansion. Henry VIII's court consisted of over one thousand people, while the King owned over sixty houses and palaces. Few of these were {{large enough to hold}} the assembled court, and thus one of the first of the King's building works (in order to transform Hampton Court to a principal residence) was to build the vast kitchens. These were quadrupled in size in 1529, enabling the King to provide <b>bouche</b> of court for his entire court. The architecture of King Henry's new palace followed the design precedent set by Wolsey: perpendicular Gothic-inspired Tudor with restrained Renaissance ornament. This hybrid architecture was to remain almost unchanged for nearly a century, until Inigo Jones introduced strong classical influences from Italy to the London palaces of the first Stuart kings.|$|E

[...] "Live Your Life" [...] and [...] "Crazy Sexy Wild" [...] are both dance recordings, with the latter one incorporating 1990s sounds in its instrumentation. [...] "Inndia" [...] has been described as oriental, with [...] "Shining Star" [...] being an electropop and dance song.

The album, however, was released in most {{areas of the world}} with its original title My Promise, including Australia where it received two times platinum sales accreditation. My Promise which became a top-5 album in countries like Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, produced two internationally popular singles, including [...] "Where Do You Go" [...] and [...] "When I Die", the first being a cover of La <b>Bouche's</b> [...] "Where Do You Go" [...] from 1994. This was followed by the single [...] "Please Don't Go", which entered the top 5 in Austria and the U.K. The trio released a re-worked version of the band Exile's number one song from 1978, [...] "Kiss You All Over", which was a moderate success on the charts but still managed to enter the top 20 in Austria, the Netherlands and the UK.|$|R

2500|$|... "Lahore" [...] {{stands out}} from the other mélodies, lasting nearly four minutes. [...] The Heine poem,subtly ironic in its {{parallel}} of the fir numbed with cold and the palm under the burning sun, allows Delage to evoke the Far East with luxurious arpeggios on the harp. [...] The end of the poem opens on a very pure, unaccompanied vocalization (bars 43 to 55 in the score) in which the singer must adjust her tessitura and sing à <b>bouche</b> fermée ("with mouth closed"), then <b>bouche</b> ouverte ("mouth open"), [...] "closing the mouth bit by bit". [...] This novel effect stunned its first audiences.|$|E

2500|$|A {{significant}} part of Suede's legacy consists in having kickstarted the Britpop scene which eventually overshadowed the band's own achievements in the public mind.

In an article about the British music press' [...] "ferocious one-upmanship campaign" [...] of the mid-1990s, Caroline Sullivan, writing for The Guardian in February 1996, noted Suede's appearance as an unsigned band on the cover of Melody Maker as a pivotal moment in the history of Britpop: ...|$|E

2500|$|Generally, Woolverton's book {{remained}} quite {{faithful to}} the original text; the plot is essentially the same, but particular detail has been added in order to [...] "flesh out" [...] the story. The feather duster and wardrobe characters – only minor characters in the animated film – were broadened into fully realized supporting characters and named for the first time; Woolverton named them Babette and Madame de la Grande <b>Bouche,</b> respectively. Taking her job seriously, Woolverton worked relentlessly on revising the script, and often took the cast's suggestions into consideration (though not always yielding to their opinions). Despite the musical having been based on a pre-existing story by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont, Woolverton retains a sole writing credit for her work.|$|E
