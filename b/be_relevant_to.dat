5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction. Gravitation is too weak to <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E

5|$|Limitations include that a {{consistent}} set of gases {{must be used}} which match the specific ratio model, and the specific ratio will only <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> a limited range of depths. As the parameters {{move away from the}} base conditions, conservatism will diverge, and the probability of symptomatic bubble formation will become more unpredictable. There is also the requirement for the diver to do mental arithmetic at depth to calculate the parameters of a safety-critical operation. This may be complicated by adverse circumstances or an emergency situation.|$|E
5|$|The {{killing of}} another person must be unlawful. Some defences are {{therefore}} open to the defendant, among them self-defence. Carrying a lawful activity, for example, a fully qualified doctor carrying out an abortion in the required circumstances, could not result in an unlawful homicide even if the child was born alive. Consent might <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> some forms of homicide, but not to murder.|$|E
5|$|The well-studied CAS {{proteins}} BCAR1 and NEDD9 {{have important}} roles in cancer and other pathological conditions, which have been addressed in many studies and reviews. EFS has attracted less study. However, the conserved functional properties of EFS relevant to cellular adhesion and migration, and RTK signaling, suggest changes in activity of this protein may also <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> cancer and other disease states, influencing prognosis and therapeutic response. The changes in EFS expression and post-translational modification {{in the context of}} disease discussed below are summarized in Table 2.|$|E

5|$|Fruit flies (Drosophila), {{because of}} the large array of {{techniques}} available for studying their genetics, have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development. In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many aspects of Drosophila neurogenetics have been shown to <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> humans. The first biological clock genes, for example, were identified by examining Drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles. A search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes, which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock—and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well. Studies done on Drosophila, also show that most neuropil regions of the brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions.|$|E
5|$|Understanding the Massey Lectures {{were part}} of the Canadian culture, Gopnik, who was born in Philadelphia but lived in Montreal between the ages of 10 to 25, wanted a topic that would <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> Canadians but also have {{universal}} appeal: winter. Winter had appeared as a theme or setting in many of his previous writings, and he especially looked forward to talking about ice hockey. Gopnik spent the next year researching and writing the book, alongside another non-fiction book he was working on at the time: The Table Comes First: Family, France, and the Meaning of Food. This other book was released shortly after Winter, and purposefully contained one identical sentence.|$|E
5|$|In a 2015 study, {{high-quality}} genome sequences {{from three}} Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths were compared. Approximately 1.4 million DNA nucleotide {{differences were found}} between mammoths and elephants, which affect the sequence of more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild type mice, and have wavier hair. There were also several alterations in circadian clock genes, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} made {{by many of the}} same filmmakers {{involved}} in The Matrix series. In 1988, producer Joel Silver acquired the rights to two of Alan Moore's works: V for Vendetta and Watchmen. After the release and relative success of Road House, writer Hilary Henkin was brought on to flesh out the project with an initial draft – one that bears little, if any, relation to the finished product, with the inclusion of overtly satirical and surrealistic elements not present in the graphic novel, as well as the removal of much of the novel's ambiguity, especially in regard to V's identity. The Wachowskis were fans of V for Vendetta and in the mid-1990s, before working on The Matrix, wrote a draft screenplay that closely followed the graphic novel. During the post-production of the second and third The Matrix films, they revisited the screenplay and offered the director's role to James McTeigue. All three were intrigued by the original story's themes and found them to <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the current political landscape. Upon revisiting the screenplay, the Wachowskis set about making revisions to condense and modernise the story, {{while at the same time}} attempting to preserve its integrity and themes. James McTeigue cites the film The Battle of Algiers as his principal influence in preparing to film V for Vendetta.|$|E
25|$|Although most {{electrical}} engineers will understand basic circuit theory (that is {{the interactions of}} elements such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and inductors in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics might <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> an engineer working on VLSI (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even circuit theory may not <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> a person designing telecommunication systems that use off-the-shelf components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for {{electrical engineers}} are reflected in university programs, which emphasize strong numerical skills, computer literacy, {{and the ability to}} understand the technical language and concepts that relate to electrical engineering.|$|E

An important insight for qualia research may come from the findings that synesthesia has the properties of ideasthesia, which then suggest a crucial role of conceptualization processes in generating qualia.|$|E
