2500|$|During Eminescu's {{withdrawal}} from public life, the poem slowly garnered its cult following. In 1887 already, the pedagogue Gh. Gh. Arbore was introducing the poem {{as one of}} the most significant ever written in Romanian. As noted by Caracostea, two anti-Junimist authors, Aron Densușianu and Alexandru Grama, resisted this trend, producing conjectural [...] "words of scorn"; Caracostea's own embrace of the poem showed its influence on the emergent (and otherwise anti-Junimist) Symbolist movement. The first author to draw inspiration from Luceafărul was Micle. The alleged Cătălina reused the themes in poems she completed after Eminescu's illness and death. She was closely followed by Eminescu's disciple Vlahuță, whose 1894 novel, Dan, [...] "transposes the conflict highlighted in Luceafărul." [...] In 1902, the Romanians in Hungary established a literary magazine of the same name, in what was a conscious nod to Eminescu's poem. Four years later, the poem had entered the Romania's national curriculum with a 7th-grade textbook by Petre V. Haneș. During this interval, Luceafărul and other Eminescian writings became the inspiration for hugely popular postcards illustrated by Leonard Salmen. A <b>bibliophile</b> <b>edition</b> with 22 artworks by Mișu Teișanu came out at the eponymous Luceafărul Society in 1921–1923.|$|E

25|$|Although De Haan's fame waned {{after his}} death, his works have been {{published}} and reprinted in a fairly constant stream. Even under the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, David Koker managed to publish his Brieven uit Jeruzalem ('Letters from Jerusalem') in a little book. In 1949, a committee was founded with the object to publish a collected edition of the poems, which duly followed in 1952. A 'Society Jacob Israël de Haan' furthered other publications: philosophical aphorisms and letters, and a memoir by his sister Mies de Haan. In the 1960s two attempts at a biography were published, and after 1970 an actual De Haan-revival brought with it a flood of publicity. Many of his publications about law and significs have been reprinted, as were his novels, and his earlier prose has been rescued from obscure magazines. Dozens of <b>bibliophile</b> <b>editions</b> honoured his poems and prose sketches. Many magazine articles and other publications about his life were published, and generated heated debates.

40|$|Istražene su tri skupine Uzelčevih erotskih i opscenih crteža i grafika nastalih u Pragu i Zagrebu izmedu 1917. i 1920. godine. Prva skupina radova nazvana Cirkus Eros nedavno je pronađena u Pragu, a crteži iz nekadašnje zbirke Vilima Svečnjaka i mapa Grčka proljeća do sada nisu bili predmetom cjelovita istraživanja. Likovnom analizom i komparacijom s crtežima sačuvanim u Zagrebu, te uz pomoć sačuvanih podataka potvrdeno je Uzelčevo autorstvo novopronađenih grafika i crteža. Razmatrane su okolnosti njihova nastanka, likovna svojstva, te su utvrđene srodnosti s europskim majstorima erotike i opscenih prizora. Milivoj Uzelac (1897 - 1977) {{was born}} in Mostar and, since his {{father was in the}} {{imperial}} service, in 1903 the family moved to Banja Luka where he received first painting lessons from Prof. Pero Popović. In 1912 the Uzelac family moved to Zagreb where Milivoj Uzelac enrolled in Tomislav Krizman 2 ̆ 7 s private school and in 1913 in Temporary Arts and Crafts High School from which he was expelled after less than a year because of inappropriate behaviour. At the end of 1915, to escape the military service, he came to Prague where he studied painting with Jan Preisler until 1918 and returned to Zagreb in 1919. In his artistic idiom the expressionist style was in 1920 replaced by a cubism-influenced construction of shape and space. In Zagreb he exhibited at the Spring Salon until 1923 when he left for Paris. In addition to easel painting where he often panted nudes and portraits, he managed to get assignments as illustrator of <b>bibliophile</b> <b>editions</b> in spite of competition, and he also produced graphic portfolios, designed theatrical sets and painted wall decorations. He moved to Cotignac, in the south of France, in 1963 and died there in 1977. This paper examines three groups of Uzelac 2 ̆ 7 s erotic and obscene drawings and prints made in Prague and Zagreb between 1917 and 1920. The first group, titled Circus Eros, has been recently discovered in Prague, while the drawings from Vilim Svećnjak 2 ̆ 7 s collection and the portfolio Greek Springs have never been properly analysed. The recently discovered prints and drawings have been attributed to Uzelac by means of comparative analysis and on the basis of preserved data. The circumstances in which they were made and their characteristics were studied to reveal similarities with the work of European masters of the erotic and obscene. Uzelac 2 ̆ 7 s youthful lascivious drawings were also his first collaboration on a literary project; later, in France, he made a number of illustrations for literary works. The early erotic and obscene drawings are linked to Uzelac 2 ̆ 7 s painterly output such as his Self-portrait in the Bar, and are neccessary for a full insight into his painting. In Croatian history of art there are no erotic or obscene art works before the 20 th century with an emancipated approach to the subject (at least, the public is not aware of them); Uzelac is therefore among the first in Croatia to handle explicitly erotic and lascivious motifs, and almost certainly the author of first obscene caricatures. His knowledge of erotic art from earlier periods (in particular the 19 th century) helped Uzelac to develop an exceptionally broad range of motifs, while his free imagination rooted {{in the spirit of the}} times and his draughtsmanship helped him to retain an individual handwriting so that each drawing reflects his temperament. Uzelac 2 ̆ 7 s talent for drawing was very important for him: not only did it help him earn his living in Prague and Zagreb but also for the most part in France where he was often commissioned to illustrate books and <b>bibliophile</b> <b>editions</b> (from Ovid to French writers such as Verville, Gaultier, Balzac, De Sade, La Fontaine); many illustrations are erotic in character...|$|R

40|$|Thanks to {{information}} elicited from unpublished archive material, {{the context in}} which Robert Guiette translated the Middle Dutch Beatrijs legend can be more clearly delineated. Correspondence with the Flemish playwright and director Herman Van Overbeke, for example, demonstrates that Guiette started by translating the former’s Beatrijs-scenario. During the interbellum period, a spectacle was a particularly appropriate means to make the Marian legend wider known. Moreover, the Flemish at the time insisted on presenting their literary masterpieces to a francophone audience. Eventually, however, the French play was never performed on stage. Unfortunately, also Guiette’s second, integral translation failed to reach its intended audience. It was published in 1930 by the Antwerp-based publishing house Lumière in a limited, <b>bibliophile</b> <b>edition</b> that remained largely unnoticed.
