The <b>bridge</b> <b>element</b> gained two small airflow [...] "fences" [...] that allowed the Williams aerodynamic team to extend the depth of the wing profile. This resulted in an increase in the aerodynamic downforce generated by the wing, without a concomitant increase in drag. Later in the season, prior to the 2008 German Grand Prix, Williams also altered the lower front wing elements, offering their drivers a choice of drag-reducing flap tweaks to the rearmost element. The bumps expected at the new Marina Bay Street Circuit, used for the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, prompted Williams to tweak the design of the front wing yet again. On this occasion the central [...] "spoon profile" [...] was given a more rounded aspect, in place of the rather more squared-off design used to this point. The change in profile reduced downforce slightly, but resulted in the FW30 being significantly less sensitive to the changes in ride height expected as the cars negotiated the bumpy surface. For the final race of the season, the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, Williams again tweaked the profile of the main and middle elements of the front wing. Small curved steps were added to the outer extremities of these elements to increase the speed of airflow through the wing tip, increasing downforce without increasing drag.|$|E

40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} {{diagnosis of}} distress and forecasting deterioration, strengthening and rehabilitation of aging bridge structures {{is a challenge}} faced by many road authorities in the world. The accurate prediction of the future condition of <b>bridge</b> <b>elements</b> is essential for optimising the maintenance activities. Most authorities conduct regular condition inspection activities followed by a higher level inspection to diagnose specific distress mechanisms. However, network level modelling utilizing condition data {{to predict the future}} condition of bridges is a need identified by bridge asset managers. In developing deterioration models for bridges, one of the major drawbacks is the limited availability of detailed inspection data. Condition data collected using discrete condition rating schemes most of the time are inadequate to develop deterministic deterioration models. Among the reliability based models which can be derived using limited condition data, Markov models have been used extensively in modelling the deterioration of infrastructure facilities. These models can predict the conditions of <b>bridge</b> <b>elements</b> as a probabilistic estimate.

[...] Pyrosequencing using the GS20 method and Solatex technology sequenced 1.6 Mbp of raw reads that each contained 36 bp, which were assembled into 95 contigs using GS20 reads. These reads were assembled in 8616 overlapping sequences that helped to further develop the genome. Through comparative genomics with the family Chlamydiaceae and the species Protochlamydia amoebophilia, a GC content of 35-36% and an approximate genome size of 2.4-3 Mbp were concluded. [...] Further analysis of the genome of P. acanthamoebae shows that this bacterium has genes that encode a chemotaxis system that is similar to the system found in Escherichia coli. [...] No other bacteria in Chlamydiales have been found to encode for a system similar to the one present in P. acanthamoebae. [...] This chemotaxis system encodes for at least 15 proteins.

In mammalian diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) the FH 2 domain is inhibited {{through an}} unknown mechanism by intramolecular binding of the diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD) and the diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID). Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report the crystal {{structure of a}} complex between DID and FH 2 -DAD fragments of the mammalian DRF, mDia 1 (mammalian diaphanous 1 also called Drf 1 or p 140 mDia). The structure shows a tetrameric configuration (4 FH 2 + 4 DID) in which the actin-binding sites on the FH 2 domain are sterically occluded.
