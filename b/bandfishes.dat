50|$|<b>Bandfishes</b> are a family, Cepolidae, of perciform marine fishes. The family {{includes}} about 21 species. They {{are native}} to the East Atlantic and Indo-Pacific, including the Mediterranean and off Southern Australia and New Zealand. They dig burrows in sandy or muddy seabed and eat zooplankton. As suggested by the name, <b>bandfishes</b> are elongated in shape, up to 80 cm long (most species only reach around half that length), and typically reddish, pinkish or yellowish in color. They are mainly found from 80 to 500 m, though most species in the genera Acanthocepola and Cepola occur at shallower depths.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bandfish</b> are an {{important}} part of the diets of many oceanic predators, especially john dories, but also other fish, common dolphins and the musky octopus, Eledone moschata. <b>Bandfish</b> may have taken up an ecological niche burrowing and eating zooplakton due to strong pressures from predators.|$|R

50|$|The Zeidae are top predators {{in their}} habitat and are noted for their marked stenophagy: juveniles feed {{exclusively}} on zooplankton, such as copepods, euphausiids, mysids, apheids, pandalids, palaemonids, {{and other small}} crustaceans. Conversely, adults feed almost exclusively on active schooling fish, such as pearlsides, porgies, young carangids (e.g., mackerels), and clupeids (e.g., sardines and pilchards); and other benthic fish, such as dragonets, gobies, filefish, flatfish, <b>bandfish,</b> and sea chubs; and occasionally on cephalopods such as squid and cuttlefish.|$|R
5000|$|Cepola schlegelii is {{a species}} of <b>bandfish</b> in the family Cepolidae. It is occurs in the Pacific coastal waters of East Asia from central Honshu south to Taiwan.

It lives in small loose groups, that gather together in the waters above their muddy burrows to catch plankton to eat. The maximum length recorded for this species is 50 cm.|$|R
40|$|THE DISTRIBUTION, ABUNDANCE, TOTAL BIOMASS, SEX RATIO, REPRODUCTION, CONDITION FACTOR, FEEDING, AGE, GROWTH AND MORTALITY OF RED <b>BANDFISH,</b> CEPOLA MACROPHTHALMA (L., 1758), WERE STUDIED USING THE OTOLITHS FROM 1113 FISH AND THE LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF 3351 FISH. SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED BY A 425 HP PROFESSIONAL TRAWLER, EQUIPPED WITH A 14 MM MESH - SIZE (KNOT - TO - KNOT) AT THE COD END, IN THE EUBOIKOS AND PAGASSITIKOS GULFS (WESTERN AEGEAN SEA, GREECE). SAMPLING TOOK PLACE SEASONALLY DURING SEPTEMBER 1986 - JUNE 1988 OVER A GRID OF 34 STATIONS AT DEPTHS RANGING FROM 22 TO 222 M. THE STUDY AREA WAS SUBDIVIDED INTO TWO REGIONS: REGION I (NORTH OF THE EURIPOS STRAIT: STATIONS 1 TO 24) AND REGION II (SOUTH OF THE EURIPOS STRAIT: STATIONS 25 TO 34). AGE - BASED AND LENGTH - BASED METHODS WERE USED AND COMPARED FOR THE STUDY OF GROWTH AND MORTALITY. TOTAL BIOMASS ESTIMATES WERE DERIVED FROM THE SWEPT AREA METHOD. THE RED <b>BANDFISH</b> COMPRISED NUMERICALLY 1. 4 % OF THE TOTAL FISH CATCH. ITS ABUNDANCE RANGED BETWEEN 0 AND 1362 INDIVIDUALS/HOUR (MEAN = 57. 7 INDIVIDUALS/HOUR, S. D. = 124. 7).

50|$|These {{fish are}} burrowers, and they feed largely like garden eels, {{sticking}} their bodies {{out of their}} burrows to catch zooplankton. Unlike garden eels, they are not fixed in their burrows, but can move about both inside their burrows and in the open. Their burrows have funnel-shaped openings, due to the large quantities of sediments they displace to construct their burrows, and they consist largely of single elliptical vertical shafts with a chamber at the bottom. The burrows reach depths of up to 1 m, and 49 cm {{is considered to be}} typical. <b>Bandfish</b> excavate and maintain their burrows at dawn or dusk, with their mouth, and by pushing mud about with their body. They displace about three litres (three quarters of a gallon) of mud and sand in the excavation of a single burrow, and they take around six hours to construct their burrows. Their burrows often connect with those of the crab Goneplax rhomboides and other burrowing fish and crustaceans, and these associations may be deliberate.|$|R
40|$|The {{ecological}} role {{of species}} can vary among populations depending on {{local and regional}} differences in diet. This is particularly true for top predators such as the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), which exhibits a highly varied diet throughout its distribution range. Local dietary assessments are therefore critical to fully understand the role of this species within marine ecosystems, {{as well as its}} interaction with important ecosystem services such as fisheries. Here, we combined stomach content analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) to describe bottlenose dolphins diet in the Gulf of Cadiz (North Atlantic Ocean). Prey items identified using SCA included European conger (Conger conger) and European hake (Merluccius merluccius) as the most important ingested prey. However, mass-balance isotopic mixing model (MixSIAR), using δ 13 C and δ 15 N, indicated that the assimilated diet consisted mainly on Sparidae species (e. g. seabream, Diplodus annularis and D. bellottii, rubberlip grunt, Plectorhinchus mediterraneus, and common pandora, Pagellus erythrinus) and a mixture of other species including European hake, mackerels (Scomber colias, S. japonicus and S. scombrus), European conger, red <b>bandfish</b> (Cepola macrophthalma) and European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). These contrasting results highlight differences in the temporal and taxonomic resolution of each approach, but also point to potential differences between ingested (SCA) and assimilated (SIA) diets. Both approaches provide different insights, e. g. determination of consumed fish biomass for the management of fish stocks (SCA) or identification of important assimilated prey species to the consumer (SIA) ...|$|R
