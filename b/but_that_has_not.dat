25|$|The exact {{origins of}} the term are unknown, but it is {{believed}} to have reflected an early 20th-century perception that Chinese immigrants did the menial labor they were consigned to with a bare minimum of adequacy, and were content with minimal reward for it. It has been suggested that it originated with a Tad Dorgan cartoon, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been proven. In the 1950s, an extended take on the term in the New York Daily News led to a petition in the Chinese-American community calling on sportswriters to stop using it.

25|$|The statute {{expanded}} MassHealth (Medicaid and SCHIP) {{coverage for}} children of low income parents and restores MassHealth benefits like dental care and eyeglasses. The legislation included a merger of the individual (non-group) insurance market into the small group market to allow individuals to get lower group insurance rates. The process of merging the two markets also froze the market for such insurance {{for a short period}} in April–May 2010 as the current government tried to keep the leading non-profit insurers, which insure over 90% of the residents, in the state from raising premiums for small businesses and individuals. Eventually the state's non-partisan insurance board ruled that the government did not have the actuarial data or right to freeze the premiums. Five of the non-profit insurers then settled for slightly lower premium increases than they had initially requested rather than litigate further. The sixth litigated and won the right to implement all its original increases retroactively. Payment rates were supposed to be increased to hospitals and physicians under the statute <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> happened. The statute also formed a Health Care Quality and Cost Council to issue quality standards and publicize provider performance.|$|E

Zaehner later acknowledged this mis-identification as a “positive mistake” (Zaehner 1972), due to Franz Cumont’s late 19thcentury notion that the Roman cult was “Roman Mazdaism” transmitted to the west by Iranian priests. Mithraic scholars no longer follow this so-called ‘continuity theory’, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> stopped the fallacy (which Zaehner also attributes to Cumont) from proliferating on the Internet.|$|E

The gentlemen whom I shall bring before you will tell you that these impressions or stamps have a knack of verifying themselves, which makes it very dangerous indeed for fraudulent persons to tamper with them. A stamp used in June will be hardly the same as it will be in July. Some little bruise will have so altered a portion of the surface as to enable detection to be made with a microscope. And the stamp used in 1870 will certainly have varied its form in 1871. Now, I maintain that time and opportunity should have been given to us to verify this impression. Copies of all impressions from day to day are kept in the Sydney post-office, and if it be found that on this day named, the 10th of May, no impression in the Sydney office is an exact facsimile of this impression then I say that this impression has been subsequently and fraudulently obtained, and that the only morsel of corroborative evidence offered to you will be shown to be false evidence. We have been unable to get impressions of this date. Opportunities have not been given to us. But I do not hesitate to tell you that you should demand such opportunities before you accept that envelope as evidence on which you can send my client to jail, and deprive that young wife, whom he has made his own, of her husband, and afford the damning evidence of your verdict towards robbing his son of his legitimacy.' ...|$|E
