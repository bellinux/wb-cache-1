40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{development of}} the Illinois ethanol industry through the period 2007 - 2022, responding to the ethanol production mandates of the Renewable Fuel Standard by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. The planning for corn-based and cellulosic ethanol production requires integrated decisions on transportation, plant location, and capacity. The objective is to minimize the total system costs for transportation and processing of biomass, transportation of ethanol from refineries to the blending terminals and demand destinations, capital investment in refineries, and <b>by-product</b> <b>credits.</b> A multi-year transshipment and facility location model is presented to determine the optimal size and time to build each plant in the system, the amount of raw material processed by individual plants, {{and the distribution of}} bioenergy crops and ethanol.

40|$|AbstractThrough {{work with}} the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency, ICF has {{developed}} a costing model for geologic sequestration of CO 2 by geologic setting in the U. S. The GeoCAT model is {{being used by the}} EPA Office of Air and Radiation to assist in analyzing the impact of potential climate change legislation. GeoCAT includes an assessment of sequestration capacity by state and geologic setting. Costing algorithms are based upon a detailed analysis of individual cost components, such as site characterization and injection well construction. The study shows that the cost of geologic sequestration without <b>by-product</b> <b>credits</b> (such as additional oil produced with enhanced oil recovery (EOR)) ranges from $ 2. 84 to $ 28. 12 per metric ton of CO 2, depending on characteristics specific to the type of geologic formation. By-product impacts on costs for EOR, enhanced coalbed methane, and shale gas production are very significant...|$|E
40|$|Biobased {{products}} and fuels {{appear to have}} a very bright future. A consortium led by NDSU is currently engaged in a project that would use cellulose nanofibers derived from wheat straw to make a product that could substitute for fiberglass and plastics in many applications, including automotive parts. The work described here analyzes the economic value of producing cellulose nanowhiskers (CNW) as a co-product in an ethanol biorefinery. An ASPEN Plus-based process model was developed to evaluate ethanol production from wheat straw. The base case model generated 54. 418 million gallons per year (MGPY) of denatured ethanol, using approximately 900, 000 tons per year of wheat straw feedstock. The capital cost was estimated at $ 185 million. Total operating costs, excluding <b>by-product</b> <b>credits,</b> were $ 92. 4 million per year. Revenue from sales was estimated at $ 98. 0 million per year from ethanol and $ 7. 5 million per year from electricity. The earnings before interest and income tax (EBIT) are $ 13. 1 million per year providing a return on investment (ROI) of 7. 06 percent. The production cost of ethanol including by-product credit was determined at $ 1. 56 per gallon. When production of CNW was added to the base case model, the manufacturing cost of producing CNW from wheat straw was estimated to be $. 57 per pound. Economic analysis indicated that production of CNW would be an enhancement to the economic performance of a wheat straw to ethanol mill. biomass, biomaterials, ethanol, wheat straw, cellulose nanowhiskers (CNW), Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the United States’ {{dependence}} on crude-oil negatively affects its economy, safety, and environment. To alleviate these negative consequences, a more economical and environmentally-friendly source of fuel, such as biomass, should be explored. The conversion of biomass to bio-oils involves the pyrolysis of biomass at about 500 °C, thus requiring a great deal of heat. This heat source could be the excess waste heat from a coal gasifier. As such, this report specifies the design of an industrial plant that produces bio-oils from biomass by using the waste heat from a coal gasifier. It is designed to produce 2. 24 × 108 kg/yr of bio-oil that can be sold at $ 0. 79 /kg. This plant involves coal and biomass solids handling, a coal gasification reactor, a biomass pyrolysis reactor, and a series of separation units to remove waste products from the syngas and isolate the bio-oil. The syngas contains methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide and is sold as a <b>by-product</b> <b>credit.</b> The plant is expected to run on feeds of 1. 5 x 1011 kg/yr of coal and 5. 4 x 108 kg/yr of raw biomass. The coal gasification reactor was sized based on the heating duty of steam at 273000 kJ/s and the biomass pyrolysis reactor was sized based on a heating duty of 7026 kJ/s. The plant’s operating factor (POF) is 0. 9 at 7884 hrs/yr running 24 hrs/day and 328. 5 days/yr. The total bare module equipment cost, including all pumps, heat exchangers, grinders, separators, absorber, and reactors is $ 93 million. The total capital investment of the plant is $ 173 million. The DCFRR and NRR are 12. 59 % and 20 % respectively. Given that selling price of bio-oil ($ 0. 79 /kg) associated with this plant is about six times more expensive that the average cost of bio-oil ($ 0. 13 /kg), it is not recommended that a Class – 1 Estimate be conducted. Before a Class – 1 Estimate can be conducted, the unnecessary costs associated with this proposed plant must be addressed and reduced. Specific attention must be paid to the following two heat exchangers, E- 127 and E- 129. Additionally, attention should be given to discover a cheaper source of industrial, liquid oxygen...|$|R
30|$|Consistent {{with recent}} {{information}} asymmetry literature, information-sharing bureaus are measured by assessing public credit bureaus and private credit registries (Triki and Gajigo 2014; Asongu et al. 2016). Asongu et al. (2016) have documented six distinguishing characteristics between public credit bureaus and private credit registries, notably: purpose, coverage, status, ownership, data sources used, and access. First, whereas private credit registries {{are made up}} of public institutions that are constituted within the framework of supervising the banking sector, public credit bureaus are created in response to the need and demand for information on borrowers in the banking market. Hence, data from private credit registries, usually employed to examine the creditworthiness of clients, could also be acknowledged as a collateral benefit or <b>by-product</b> of private <b>credit</b> registries. Second, while the coverage engendered by private credit registries is restricted in terms of information (or data) type and history provided, public credit bureaus extend beyond the scope of large corporations and include small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) that are characterized by richer data and longer histories. Third, whereas public credit bureaus are fundamentally established for profit making, private credit registries are not primarily focused on profits. Fourth, on the issue of ownership, whereas public credit registries belong to governments and/or central banks, the ownership of private credit bureaus revolve outside highlighted establishments (central banks and governments) to include lenders, lenders’ associates, and independent third parties. Fifth, while the data used by private credit registries are sourced from non-bank and bank financial establishments, data from public credit bureaus entails private credit registries, tax authorities, courts and utilities, to sources employed by private credit registries for information. Sixth, access to private credit registries (public credit bureaus) is restricted to providers of information (open to all lender types).|$|R
40|$|This report compares {{estimated}} {{production costs}} from four energy-intensive industries (steel, cement, chemical and non-ferrous metals) in the European Union and some third countries. Production costs have been estimated following a bottom-up approach, i. e. using information at facility level from a representative number of facilities. Costs are broken down to key factors, such as material, labour and energy costs and exclude capital costs (depreciation and interest). Moreover, the energy costs are estimated considering {{the effect of}} the state of technologies and the fuel mix in each country. For the iron and steel industry the production costs of hot-rolled coil and wire rod are analysed as representative flat and long products, respectively. The production costs of these products have been estimated for both the integrated route (blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace) and the recycling route (electrical arc furnace). For the chemical industry, the products analysed are ammonia, methanol, ethylene and propylene; whereas for the non-ferrous metals the analysis is focused on primary aluminium production, copper cathodes and slabs of zinc. Most of the EU 28 production costs are ranked (when compared with certain competitor countries) between the 75 th percentile and the maximum production cost. These costs are highest in the EU relative to other countries or regions in the case of flat products from the recycling route, ammonia and methanol. For long products -from the recycling route-, flat products -from the integrated route-, ethylene, propylene -refinery grade- and copper anode the EU 28 production costs are between the median (the median separates the higher half of the costs from the lower half) and the 75 th percentile of all production costs estimated. In the case of cement, the EU 28 production cost is quite similar to the value of the median cost. There are also cases in which the EU 28 production costs were among the lowest costs, namely for copper cathode and zinc slabs. It is worth noting that the contribution of energy costs to production costs is the highest in the EU only for methanol and ammonia. For all other products and industries analysed (including methanol and ammonia), other components of the cost (raw materials, labour and others or feedstock) contribute more to final costs than energy (natural gas is considered as a feedstock for methanol and ammonia). It is also noteworthy that, in most industries and products, the behaviour of <b>credits</b> (<b>by-products,</b> home scrap, electricity production from waste gases or from combined heat and power) contributes to reduce production costs more in the EU than it does in other countries or regions.
