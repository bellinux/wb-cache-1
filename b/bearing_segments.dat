40|$|Root diameter, {{especially}} apical diameter, {{plays an}} important role in root development and function. The variation in diameter between roots, and along roots, affects root structure and thus the root system's overall foraging performance. However, the effect of diameter variation on root elongation, branching and topological connections has not been examined systematically in a population of high-order roots, nor along the roots, especially for mature plants grown in the field. A method combining both excavation and analysis was applied to extract and quantify root architectural traits of adult, field-grown maize plants. The relationships between root diameter and other root architectural characteristics are analysed for two maize cultivars. The basal diameter of the lateral roots (orders 1 – 3) was highly variable. Basal diameter was partly determined by the diameter of the <b>bearing</b> <b>segment.</b> Basal diameter defined a potential root length, but the lengths of most roots fell far short of this. This was explained partly by differences in the pattern of diameter change along roots. Diameter tended to decrease along most roots, with the steepness of the gradient of decrease depending on basal diameter. The longest roots were those that maintained (or sometimes increased) their diameters during elongation. The branching density (cm– 1) of laterals was also determined by the diameter of the <b>bearing</b> <b>segment.</b> However, the location of this <b>bearing</b> <b>segment</b> along the mother root was also involved – intermediate positions were associated with higher densities of laterals. The method used here allows us to obtain very detailed records of the geometry and topology of a complex root system. Basal diameter and the pattern of diameter change along a root were associated with its final length. These relationships are especially useful in simulations of root elongation and branching in source–sink models...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} convincing {{arguments}} for positing prosodic constituents such as the syllable or the mora comes from capturing the regularities of segment distribution. Under this view, originally introduced by Kahn 1978, prosodic organization is directly responsible for most aspects of segment sequencing and segment alternations. However, determining the role of prosody in cases of abundant interactions with morphology may be less than a straightforward task. One such case, found in Serbian (Neo-štokavian dialect), {{is the focus of}} the present study. In this paper we first establish the properties of syllabic and moraic structures in Serbian, and then turn to the issue of how these properties account for one specific distributional regularity. My central concern is whether static restrictions on segment sequencing necessarily mirror prosodically motivated groupings of segments. The analysis is cast in Optimality Theory (McCarthy and Prince 1993, Prince and Smolensky 1993). We first focus on the syllable nucleus, and the segments that may occupy this position, and then turn to the problem of what segments may contribute to syllable weight. Of central relevance, in determining the set of weight <b>bearing</b> <b>segments,</b> are the interactions with a morphologically base...|$|E
40|$|European {{populations of}} the geophilomorph {{centipede}} Haplophilus subterraneus show {{a high proportion of}} individuals with morphological anomalies, suggesting high levels of developmental instability. The broad geographic distribution of this phenomenon seems to exclude local environmental causes, but the source of instability is still to be identified. The goal {{of the present study was}} to collect quantitative data on the occurrence of phenodeviants in different populations, along with data on the patterns of genetic variation within and between populations, in order to investigate possible association between developmental instability and genetic features. In a sample of 11 populations of H. subterraneus, distributed in western and central Europe, we looked for phenodeviants, in particular with respect to trunk morphology, and studied genetic variation through the genotyping of microsatellite loci. Overall, no support was found to the idea that developmental instability in H. subterraneus is related to a specific patterns of genetic variation, including inbreeding estimates. We identified a major genetic partition that subdivides French populations from the others, and a low divergence among northwestern areas, which are possibly related to the post-glacial recolonization from southern refugia and/or to recent anthropogenic soil displacements. A weak correlation between individual number of leg <b>bearing</b> <b>segments</b> and the occurrence of trunk anomalies seems to support a trade-off between these two developmental traits. These results, complemented by preliminary data on developmental stability in two related species, suggest that the phenomenon has not a simple taxonomic distribution, while it exhibits an apparent localization in central and eastern Europe...|$|E

40|$|In this diploma thesis two partial {{studies of}} the {{instrumentation}} of a hydropower unit are conducted. These are carried out {{within the scope of}} the JUSPOWER-project. The first part of the thesis deals with the instrumentation of the runner. The incorporation of sensors in a Kaplan runner blade is tested in a experimental set-up on a laboratory scale without dismantling the runner. A further development of the design is suggested that enables damaged sensors to be replaced. The sensors are calibrated with a system destined to be used on site. The results show that the sensors function properly in the test set-up. Further calibration will though be needed during the installation on the runner blade and under operational conditions. The suction cup of the calibration system may have to be modified depending on the shape of the runner blade. The second part is a comparison study concerned with the choice of sensors for radial load measurements at the guide bearings. To measure the load on the <b>bearing</b> <b>segments,</b> the dowel peg on the bearing segment would either be replaced by a load cell or modified so strain gages could be bonded onto the peg itself. The performance of the sensors is evaluated in a loading machine with respect to linearity, hysteresis and sensitivity. Furthermore, the stiffness of the load cell is experimentally determined in a load machine. The results show that the strain gages bonded on the modified dowel peg do not have a reliable output signal. However, the installation of the tested load cell would alter the stiffness of the dowel peg. The load cell had a stiffness that was almost 50 % lower than the dowel peg...|$|E

The published article can be found at: [URL] maritima (Myriapoda; Chilopoda) is a species from the soil-living order of geophilomorph centipedes.

They are notable for their large number of appendage <b>bearing</b> <b>segments</b> and are {{being used as a}} laboratory model to study the embryological process of segmentation within the myriapods. Using a scaffold derived from the recently published genome of Strigamia maritima that contained multiple mitochondrial protein-coding genes, here we report the complete mitochondrial genome of Strigamia, the first from any geophilomorph centipede. The mitochondrial genome of S. maritima is a circular molecule of 14, 938 base pairs, within which we could identify the typical mitochondrial genome complement of 13 protein-coding genes and 2 ribosomal RNA genes. Sequences resembling 16 of the 22 transfer RNA genes typical of metazoan mitochondrial genomes could be identified, many of which have clear deviations from the standard ‘cloverleaf’ secondary structures of tRNA. Phylogenetic trees derived from the concatenated alignment of protein-coding genes of S. maritima and > 50 other metazoans were unable to resolve the Myriapoda as monophyletic, but did support a monophyletic group of chilopods: Strigamia was resolved as the sister group of the scolopendromorph Scolopocryptos sp. and these two (Geophilomorpha and Scolopendromorpha), along with the Lithobiomorpha, formed a monophyletic group the Pleurostigmomorpha. Gene order within the S. maritima mitochondrial genome is unique compared to any other arthropod or metazoan mitochondrial genome to which it has been compared. The highly unusual organisation of the mitochondrial genome of Strigamia maritima is in striking contrast with the conservatively evolving nuclear genome: sampling of more members of this order of centipedes will be required to see whether this unusual organization is typical of the Geophilomorpha or results from a more recent reorganisation in the lineage leading to Strigamia...|$|E
40|$|This thesis has {{the dual}} purpose of raising {{awareness}} {{of the importance of}} the mixing protocol on the end products of polyelectrolyte-oppositely charged surfactant systems, and to contribute to a better understanding of the properties of bottle-brush polyelectrolytes when adsorbed onto interfaces. In the first part of this thesis work, the effects of the mixing protocol and the mixing procedure on formed polyelectrolyte-oppositely charged surfactant aggregates were investigated. It was shown that the initial properties of the aggregates were highly dependent on the mixing parameters, and that the difference between the resulting aggregates persisted for long periods of time. The second part of the studies was devoted to the surface properties of a series of bottle-brush polyelectrolytes made of charged segments and segments bearing poly(ethylene oxide) side chains; particular attention was paid to the effect of side chain to charge density ratio of the polyelectrolytes. It was shown that the adsorbed mass of the polyelectrolytes, and the corresponding number of poly(ethylene oxide) <b>bearing</b> <b>segments</b> at the interface, went through a maximum as the charge density of the polyelectrolyte was increased. Also, it was found that bottle-brush polyelectrolyte layers were desorbed quite easily when subjected to salt solutions. This observation was rationalized by the unfavourable excluded volume interactions between the side chains and the entropic penalty of confining them at an interface, which weaken the strength of the binding of the polyelectrolytes to the interface. However, it was shown that the same side chains effectively protect the adsorbed layer against desorption when the layer is exposed to solutions containing an oppositely charged surfactant. Investigation of the lubrication properties of the bottle-brush polyelectrolytes in an asymmetric (mica-silica) system also related the observed favourable frictional properties to the protective nature of the side chains. The decisive factor for achieving very low coefficients of friction was found to be the concentration of the side chains in the gap between the surfaces. Interestingly, it was shown that a brush-like conformation of the bottle-brush polyelectrolyte at the interface has little effect on achieving favourable lubrication properties. However, a brush-like conformation is vital for the resilience of the adsorbed layer against the competitive adsorption of species with a higher surface affinity. QC 2010083...|$|E

5000|$|Originally {{it seems}} that each {{appendage}} <b>bearing</b> <b>segment</b> had two separate pairs of appendages; and upper and a lower pair. These would later fuse into {{a single pair of}} biramous appendages, with the upper branch acting as a gill while the lower branch was used for locomotion.

Scientific work {{is devoted}} to study the {{influence}} of dynamic coefficients of <b>bearings</b> <b>segment</b> (coefficients of resistance and recirculating power) on stability and subharmonics self-oscillating components of the rotor vibration in unstable region of rotational speeds. Methodology. The study {{is based on the}} methods: the theory of vibrations of mechanical systems with lumped parameters; Lagrange functions; linear algebra. Findings. The researchers made: a) justification of the discrete two-mass model of an unbalanced rotor, which takes into account the influence of rotation on dynamic coefficients; b) analysis and improvement of methods for engineering analysis of stability and parameter subharmonic self-oscillations in the unstable range of frequencies of rotation of the rotor; c) installation and classification of the main rotor causes of vibrations constructive or those arising in the manufacture, assembly and operation of the machine, and on the other hand, rotary systems specific for non-conservative forces, that lead under certain conditions to the self-oscillation; d) determination (identification) the characteristics/differences of rotor vibration, which {{lies in the fact that}} in most cases they are associated with the transverse vibrations of the rotors, while torsional or longitudinal oscillations play the incomparably smaller role, and therefore the last in this study were rejected; e) it is shown that the characteristic feature of the functioning of rotor systems of modern machines and units have no direct relationship with the level of vibration with amount of power that is transmitted through them or produced engine. Originality. In this paper the authors first considered the nonlinear response bearing lubrication layer, namely the coefficients of resistance and circulating forces that determine the dynamic coefficient of <b>segment</b> <b>bearings.</b> Practical value. The engineering calculations subharmonic stability and self-oscillations of the rotor (unbalanced) in unstable frequency of rotation are adjusted and significantly improved. The results of this work can be used to analyze rotary systems which under certain conditions can cause vibration that is not caused by some external periodic loads (or imperfections of the rotor) and the conditions of occurrence of which is not associated with some (any) resonant ratio (i. e., the system with self-excitation or self-oscillations). The latter are caused by the action of nonconservative forces of circulation type (circulation strength associated with the displacement vector of the rotor, not the velocity vector, as in systems with «negative» friction). As the circulating force vector is perpendicular to the vector displacement of the rotor, resulting in such a force can manifest themselves only in mechanical (rotary) systems with many degrees of freedom of movement greater than one. In addition, an important feature of the circulation of forces there should not be conservative, so the results can be used to study non-conservative rotor systems with asymmetric (skew-symmetric) matrix of coefficients. ...|$|R
