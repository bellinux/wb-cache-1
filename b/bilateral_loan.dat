40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an empirical {{investigation of the}} choice between different sources of debt finance based on a sample of UK non-financial companies listed on the London Stock Exchange FTSE 350 between 2001 and 2008. New evidence is provided on (i) the importance of differentiating between syndicated and <b>bilateral</b> bank <b>loans,</b> and (ii) the impact that bankers sitting {{on the board of}} directors have on the borrowing firms' choice of debt source. The evidence presented in this thesis contributes to the large body of US research concerning a firm's choice of debt source. Initially, the study investigates what type of firm chooses to issue particular sources of debt, and why. The findings show that the primary determinant of a firm's choice of debt source is its ability to provide collateral to secure against its debt. Although there is no evidence of bank affiliation playing a significant role in driving access to the public capital markets or to syndicated loans in the UK, issuers of <b>bilateral</b> <b>loans</b> are found to be more likely to have an affiliation to a bank than issuers of public, syndicated bank or non-bank private debt. Secondly, the study examines the stock market response to announcements of public, bank (both syndicated and bilateral), and non-bank private debt. The results provide no evidence of any abnormal stock market response following announcements of either public bonds or non-bank private debt. There is strong evidence of a positive market response to announcements of bank loans, driven by the positive market response to syndicated loans. There is little evidence of any market response to announcements of <b>bilateral</b> <b>loans.</b> The market appears to view announcements of syndicated loans made by companies which have a banker on their board in a positive manner, but no such response is observed for announcements of <b>bilateral</b> <b>loans.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The ouster of Yanukovych plunged Ukraine into the 2014 Crimean crisis and the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine. In March 2014 the EU condemned the Annexation of Crimea by Russia and Russia's [...] "clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces". The EU also froze (and tried to recover) [...] "misappropriated Ukrainian state funds" [...] and froze assets and blocked entry into the EU of Russians and Ukrainians deemed responsible for the unrest in Ukraine. The political part of the Association Agreement was signed on 21 March 2014 by new Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. Customs duties for Ukrainian exports to the EU were temporarily removed in April 2014. Financial help was also promised to Ukraine. Ukraine was granted a macro-financial aid <b>bilateral</b> <b>loan</b> of one billion Euro in May 2014. The European Union and Ukraine signed the economic part of the Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement on 27 June 2014. President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy described the signing as a [...] "great day for Europe". Signatory (then new) President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko called it [...] "Ukraine is underlining its sovereign choice in favour of membership of the EU", and also described it as Ukraine's [...] "first but most decisive step" [...] towards EU membership. Poroshenko also set 2020 as a target for an EU membership application. As the Voice of America reported on 27 June, [...] "Terms of the EU agreements require Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine not enter into similar free trade agreements with the Kremlin." [...] On 16 September 2014 the Verkhovna Rada approved the draft law on ratification of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, which was signed the same day by President Petro Poroshenko. The 17th EU-Ukraine summit took place on April 27, 2015 in Kiev. During an Eastern Partnership summit in Riga in May 2015, EU agreed on a €1.8bn loan to Ukraine. On January 1, 2016, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area between Ukraine and the EU entered into force. By April 2016, the Association Agreement had been ratified by Ukraine and all EU member states except the Netherlands, which held a referendum on approval of the treaty.

This discussion paper surveys the general policy debate on conditionality in lending, as well as China’s own debate on conditionality. We then examine <b>bilateral</b> <b>loans</b> provided by Chinese state-owned policy banks, notably China Exim Bank, arguing that the assumption of China’s shunning conditionality is valid only if the term is taken narrowly to imply the specific set of policy conditions (e. g. privatisation and financial liberalisation) routinely called for by World Bank Group lenders. Based on a literature review and analysis of loan features along with tentative evidence from empirical cases of Chinese bilateral lending, we identify four hypothetical types of conditionality: political conditionality, embedded conditionality, cross-conditionality and emergent conditionality. In all likelihood the last three types of conditionality are not imposed by a unitary state actor, but emerge as an indirect consequence of the voluminous business activities of Chinese state-linked lenders and enterprises in developing countries.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{whether and how}} the earnings quality and state-ownership of Chinese corporate borrowers affect the features of syndicated loans, in terms of loan spread, maturity, syndication structure and the participation of foreign lenders. Using sample syndicated loan facilities issued to Chinese public firms over 1998 - 2016, we show novel and robust evidence that earnings quality is negatively associated with loan spread and state-ownership is positively associated with loan maturity, the concentration of syndication structure and the participation of foreign lenders as lead arrangers. In contrast to evidence on <b>bilateral</b> <b>loans,</b> we find state-ownership does not affect syndicated loan prices. We also show that compared with domestic lenders, foreign lenders rely more heavily on ‘hard’ information. They charge lower spread, than domestic lenders, from Chinese borrowers with higher earnings quality and they {{are more willing to}} lead loan syndications for state-owned borrowers. Overall, our findings are consistent with the conjecture that earnings quality {{plays an important role in}} alleviating the asymmetric information issue and state-ownership serves as a favorable signal for implicit guarantee for repayment in syndicated loan market in China...|$|R
