5|$|The {{two stars}} in Serpens Caput that {{form part of}} the Snake's body below the heart are Epsilon and Mu Serpentis, both third-magnitude A-type main-sequence stars. Both have a peculiarity: Epsilon is an Am star, while Mu is a binary. Located {{slightly}} northwest of Mu is 36 Serpentis, another A-type main-sequence star. This star also has a peculiarity; it is a binary with the primary component being a Lambda Boötis star, meaning that it has solar-like amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, while containing very low amounts of iron peak elements. 25 Serpentis, positioned a few degrees northeast of Mu Serpentis, is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a hot <b>B-type</b> giant and an A-type main-sequence star. The primary is a slowly pulsating B star, which causes the system to vary by 0.03 magnitudes.|$|E

5|$|As {{the galactic}} plane passes through it, Serpens Cauda {{contains}} many massive OB stars.

Although not visible to the naked eye, HD 167971 (MY Serpentis) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple system consisting of three very hot O-type stars. A member of the cluster NGC 6604, the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one being of the very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or supergiant of a late O or early B spectral type.

40|$|We give a world-sheet {{description}} of D-brane {{in terms of}} gluing conditions on T M ⊕ T ∗M.

3000|$|To preview the {{implications}} of the previous two cases in a dynamic framework, picture a setting as in Fig.  3, where the <b>B-types</b> in the ability range a^d< a< a^m [...] pay σ = c̅ to participate in the market involving interlinkages and, therefore, are at the risk of facing discrimination if they are paired with a discriminatory principal. This arises because the expected return from risking discrimination is greater than the expected deadweight loss. Thus, {{it is easy to see}} that if there are no taste discriminators, all their offers will be accepted, and in a dynamic model in the long run nobody would believe that discrimination exists because no offers subject to potential discrimination are ever rejected. In Fig.  4, <b>B-types</b> either enter the market without interlinkages or make offers that compensate the taste for discrimination. In other words, in a dynamic setting there are no offers made which could be rejected and subject to discrimination, implying there is no scope for updating beliefs and thus discrimination will persist in the long run. We formalize this intuition in what follows.|$|R
5|$|Alpha Apodis is {{an orange}} giant of {{spectral}} type K3III located 447 ± 8 {{light years away}} from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 3.8.

5|$|The {{star system}} is the {{prototype}} {{of a group of}} eclipsing binary stars named Algol variables, though it has a third member to make up what is actually a triple star system. The brightest component is a blue-white main-sequence star of spectral type B8V, which is 3.5 times as massive and 180 times as luminous as the Sun. The secondary component is an orange subgiant star of type K0IV that has begun cooling and expanding to 3.5 times the radius of the Sun, and has 4.5 times the luminosity and 80% of its mass. These two are separated by only 0.05 astronomical units (AU)—five percent of the distance between the Earth and Sun; the main dip in brightness arises when the larger fainter companion passes in front of the hotter brighter primary. The tertiary component is a main sequence star of type A7, which is located on average 2.69 AU from the other two stars. AG Persei is another Algol variable in Perseus, whose primary component is a <b>B-type</b> main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 6.69. Phi Persei is a double star, although the two components do not eclipse each other. The primary star is a Be star of spectral type B0.5, possibly a giant star, and the secondary companion is likely a stellar remnant. The secondary has a similar spectral type to O-type subdwarfs.|$|E

The next batch of 1,040 K-types entered service from May 1920 until 1921, and were mainly used in central London. This allowed smaller <b>B-types</b> to be used on new routes in and around London.

Another irregular variable, RX Telescopii is a red supergiant that varies between magnitudes 6.45 and 7.47, just visible to the unaided eye under good viewing conditions. BL Telescopii is an Algol-like eclipsing binary system that varies between apparent magnitudes 7.09 and 9.08 over a period of just over 778 days (2 years 48 days). The primary is a yellow supergiant that is itself intrinsically variable. Dipping from its baseline magnitude of 9.6 to 16.5, RS Telescopii is a rare R Coronae Borealis variable—an extremely hydrogen-deficient supergiant thought to have arisen {{as the result of the}} merger of two white dwarfs; fewer than 100 have been discovered as of 2012. The dimming is thought to be caused by carbon dust expelled by the star. As of 2012, four dimmings have been observed. PV Telescopii is a class <b>B-type</b> (blue) extreme helium star that is the prototype of a class of variables known as PV Telescopii variables. First discovered in 1952, it was found to have a very low level of hydrogen. One theory of its origin is that it is the result of a merger between a helium- and a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. If the combined mass does not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit, the former will accrete onto the latter star and ignite to form a supergiant. Later this will become an extreme helium star before cooling to become a white dwarf.|$|E
