25|$|Hydrogen cyanide {{was tested}} as a {{chemical}} weapon in WWI {{but was not}} found to be very effective. United States and Italy used hydrogen cyanide against the Central Powers in 1918. France had used it in combat already in 1916, but this proved to be ineffective due to weather conditions. The gas is lighter than air and rapidly disperses up into the atmosphere; this is in contrast to denser agents such as phosgene or chlorine which tend to remain at ground level. Compared to such agents it must also be present in higher concentrations in order to be fatal. These properties combine to make its use in the field impractical. A hydrogen cyanide concentration in the range of 100–200 ppm in air will kill a human within 10 to 60 minutes. A hydrogen cyanide concentration of 2000 ppm (about 2380mg/m3) will kill a human in about 1 minute. The toxicity is caused by the cyanide ion, which halts cellular respiration by acting as a non-competitive inhibitor for an enzyme in mitochondria called cytochrome c oxidase. As such hydrogen cyanide is commonly listed among chemical warfare as a <b>blood</b> <b>agent.</b> It is listed under Schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention as a potential weapon which has large-scale industrial uses, manufacturing plants in signatory countries which produce more than 30 metric tons per year must be declared to, and can be inspected by, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} proposed chemical weapons, cacodyl oxide, or Cadet's fuming liquid, also displays properties of a <b>blood</b> <b>agent</b> (as {{well as those of}} a malodorant). It was proposed as a chemical weapon in the British Empire during the Crimean War, along with the significantly more potent <b>blood</b> <b>agent,</b> cacodyl cyanide.|$|E

50|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>agents</b> {{work through}} {{inhalation}} or ingestion. As chemical weapons, <b>blood</b> <b>agents</b> are typically disseminated as aerosols and take effect through inhalation. Due to their volatility, {{they are more}} toxic in confined areas than in open areas.|$|R

50|$|The {{information}} in the following table, which lists <b>blood</b> <b>agents</b> of military significance, is taken from Ledgard. The values given are {{on a scale from}} 1 to 10.|$|R
50|$|The C2 {{canister}} on the M40 mask {{can protect}} the user from up to 15 nerve, choking, and blister agent attacks, and two <b>blood</b> <b>agent</b> attacks.|$|E
50|$|A <b>blood</b> <b>agent</b> is a toxic {{chemical}} agent {{that affects the}} body by being absorbed into the blood. Blood agents are fast-acting, potentially lethal poisons that typically manifest at room temperature as volatile colorless gases with a faint odor. They are either cyanide- or arsenic-based.|$|E
50|$|AC (1942-1944): Hydrocyanic Acid, a clear liquid that vaporizes into a <b>blood</b> <b>agent</b> gas upon exposure. Symptoms are: dizziness, {{headache}} and {{a rush of}} blood to the head. Effects are: an inability for blood to release stored oxygen molecules to the body, resulting in death.|$|E
50|$|Both the U.S. and Confederacy used {{poison gas}} {{in both the}} Great War and the Second Great War, {{including}} blister <b>agents,</b> <b>blood</b> <b>agents,</b> and nerve agents, which required soldiers to get into clumsy and hot chemical protective suits.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blood</b> pool <b>agents</b> (BPAs) are a {{class of}} {{magnetic}} resonance angiography contrast <b>agents.</b> <b>Blood</b> pool <b>agents</b> (also known as intravascular contrast agents) are differentiated from other contrast agents due to their high molecular weight and higher relaxivities. Their large size prevents diffusion through the vascular epithelium and leakage into the interstitial space, {{and because of this}} they stay in the vascular system for a longer time period. Most contrast agents, leave the vascular system within a few minutes, however <b>blood</b> pool <b>agents</b> remain in the circulation for up to an hour, extending the window available for imaging. Longer image acquisition times allow better signal-to-noise ratio and improved image resolution.|$|R
50|$|Cyanide-based <b>blood</b> <b>agents</b> irritate {{the eyes}} and the {{respiratory}} tract, while arsine is nonirritating. Hydrogen cyanide has a faint, bitter, almond odor that {{only about half of}} all people can smell. Arsine has a very faint garlic odor detectable only at greater than fatal concentrations.|$|R
50|$|This {{chemical}} is very flammable, highly toxic, and reactive. If ingested or absorbed through skin, it {{will cause}} mild nerve agent symptoms directly as well as <b>blood</b> <b>agent</b> symptoms due to release of HCN. If mixed with water, it gives off poisonous hydrogen cyanide fumes and dimethylamidophosphoric acid.|$|E
50|$|Sodium cyanide and {{potassium}} cyanide, colorless crystalline compounds similar in appearance to sugar, also act as blood agents. Carbon monoxide could technically {{be called a}} <b>blood</b> <b>agent</b> because it binds with oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in the blood (see carbon monoxide poisoning), but its high volatility makes it impractical as a chemical warfare agent.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} CK, {{cyanogen}} chloride {{is a highly}} toxic <b>blood</b> <b>agent,</b> and was once proposed for use in chemical warfare. It causes immediate injury upon contact with the eyes or respiratory organs. Symptoms of exposure may include drowsiness, rhinorrhea (runny nose), sore throat, coughing, confusion, nausea, vomiting, edema, loss of consciousness, convulsions, paralysis, and death. It is especially dangerous because {{it is capable of}} penetrating the filters in gas masks, according to U.S. analysts. CK is unstable due to polymerization, sometimes with explosive violence.|$|E
50|$|At {{sufficient}} concentrations, <b>blood</b> <b>agents</b> {{can quickly}} saturate {{the blood and}} cause death {{in a matter of}} minutes or seconds. They cause powerful gasping for breath, violent convulsions and a painful death that can take several minutes. The immediate cause of death is usually respiratory failure.|$|R
50|$|Example: For an <b>agent</b> which lowers <b>blood</b> {{pressure}}, if {{the blood}} pressure of the person taking the <b>blood</b> pressure <b>agent</b> was high before taking the <b>agent,</b> and the <b>blood</b> pressure reduces to the desired level (or at least closer) then the effect is considered desirable. However, if the same person takes the <b>blood</b> pressure <b>agent</b> when their <b>blood</b> pressure was not high and their blood pressure goes lower, {{to the point that}} they are dizzy and have difficultly standing without falls and injury, then the same <b>blood</b> pressure <b>agent</b> is undesirable.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for chemical weapons {{to be used}} in terrorism is a real possibility. Classes of chemical weapons include nerve agents, vesicants (blister agents), choking agents, incapacitating agents, riot control <b>agents,</b> <b>blood</b> <b>agents,</b> and toxic industrial chemicals. The nerve agents work by blocking the actions of acetylcholinesterase leading to a cholinergic syndrome. Nerve agents include sarin, tabun, VX, cyclosarin, and soman. The vesicants include sulfur mustard and lewisite. The vesicants produce blisters and also damage the upper airways. Choking agents include phosgene and chlorine gas. Choking agents cause pulmonary edema. Incapacitating agents include fentanyl and its derivatives and adamsite. Riot control agents include Mace and pepper spray. <b>Blood</b> <b>agents</b> include cyanide. The mechanism of toxicity for cyanide is blocking oxidative phosphorylation. Toxic industrial chemicals include agents such as formaldehyde, hydrofluoric acid, and ammonia...|$|R

5000|$|The M1 grenade {{could be}} filled with any {{of a number of}} {{chemical}} compounds depending upon the effect required, in both lethal and non-lethal combinations. Most fillers were liquid compounds selected because they were activated by exposure to the air, thus not requiring a detonator. AC filler (Hydrocyanic Acid) was a <b>blood</b> <b>agent.</b> CNS (Chloracetophenone solution) was a tear gas made from CN gas (Chloracetophenone) dissolved in Chlorpicrin and Chloroform. M1 (B Chlorvinyldichlorarsine, or [...] "Lewisite") was a liquid that turned into a powerful vesicant gas upon exposure that chemically burned the surfaces of exposed skin and lungs.|$|E

5000|$|The SS-Sonderkommando [...] "Lange" [...] was {{supplied}} with two vans initially, each carrying about 50 Jews gassed {{en route to}} the forest. Later on, Lange was given three gas vans by the RSHA in Berlin for the killing of greater numbers of victims. The vehicles had been converted to mobile gas-chambers by the Gaubschat company in Berlin which, by June 1942, produced twenty of them in accordance with the SS purchase order. The sealed compartments (also called superstructures) installed on the chassis had floor openings - about 60 mm in diameter - with metal pipes welded below, into which the engine exhaust was directed. The exhaust gases causing death by asphyxia were tested by a chemist from T-4 to make sure they contained large enough amounts of carbon monoxide (or 1% concentration), to form carboxyhaemoglobin, a deadly <b>blood</b> <b>agent,</b> in combining with haemoglobin in the cells. The victims were thereby deprived internally of life-giving oxygen before death.|$|E

40|$|An J yv {{screening}} procedure was established at Battelle's Medical Research and Evaluation Facility (MREF) {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of candidate pretreatment compounds in mice challenged with the <b>blood</b> <b>agent,</b> sodium cyanide (NaCN). Male albino mice of ICR outbred stock weighing between 22. 5 and 27. 5 g are challenged by intramuscular (i. m.) injection, at a volume of 0. 5 mL/kg, of a dose of NaCN twice the LDi 0 of untreated mice as determined on that day of testing. Candidate drugs are tested at fractions of their LD 50 or their limit of solubility in the most optimum vehicle and given intraperitoneally (i. p.) to separate groups of mice at either 60 or 15 min prior to NaCN challenge. Sodium thiosulfate (1000 mg/kg) /sodium nitrite (100 mg/kg) controls are injected i. p. only at 60 min prior to challenge. A test compound is deemed effective if, at any of three concentrations tested, or at either pretreatment time, it is statistically more efficacious in preventing lethality than is a negative control substance (candidate compound vehicle). Since 1988, approximately 250 candidate compounds have been evaluated with 22 of these passing the efficacy screen. Motor incapacitation is tested in survivors of efficacy experiments 24 hr following NaCN injection using a horizontal screen test...|$|E

40|$|WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT * Albuminuria {{has been}} proven to be {{associated}} with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. * Such an association has been found not only in subjects with diabetes and hypertension, but also in the general population. * It could therefore be expected that especially subjects with higher albuminuria levels may benefit from <b>blood</b> pressure-lowering <b>agents</b> to improve their cardiovascular outcome. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS * This study indicates that the efficacy of <b>blood</b> pressure-lowering <b>agents</b> to prevent cardiovascular events is dependent of the level of albuminuria before start of such treatment. * The higher baseline albuminuria, the better the relative and absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events with blood pressure-lowering drugs. * The data also suggest a possible better cardiovascular protective effect of renin-angiotensin intervening agents compared with other <b>blood</b> pressure-lowering <b>agents.</b> AIMS Albuminuria {{has been proven}} {{to be associated with}} cardiovascular (CV) events in specific patient populations, but also in the general population. This study aimed to investigate whether the efficacy of <b>blood</b> pressure-lowering <b>agents</b> in preventing CV events depends on baseline urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and, if so, whether this holds true for <b>blood</b> pressure-lowering <b>agents</b> in general, or is limited to agents that interfere in the renin-angiotensin system. METHODS Data were used from a community-based cohort study and pharmacy dispensing records. Included were subjects with hypertension (systolic blood pressure >/= 140 and/or diastolic blood pressure >/= 90 mmHg), no cardiovascular disease history, and no previous use of <b>blood</b> pressure-lowering <b>agents.</b> RESULTS During study follow-up (7. 1 +/- 1. 6 years), 122 CV events were observed in 1185 subjects included. Start of <b>blood</b> pressure-lowering <b>agents</b> vs. non-use was associated with a difference in absolute CV event risk of 0. 7 %, 6 % and 12. 6 % for all subjects, those with UAE >/= 15 mg day(- 1) and >/= 30 mg day(- 1), respectively. Cox regression analysis showed that the relative risk for CV events after start of <b>blood</b> pressure-lowering <b>agents</b> was significantly dependent (P /= 15 and >/= 30 mg day(- 1), respectively. Results adjusted for covariates were essentially similar. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ACEi/ARB) treatment tended to be associated with a more favourable CV prognosis when compared with non-ACEi/ARB treatment (difference P = 0. 06). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the efficacy of <b>blood</b> pressure-lowering <b>agents</b> to prevent CV events is dependent on baseline albuminuria. The higher baseline albuminuria, the more absolute as well as relative risk reduction can be achieved. Our data suggest that this may especially be true for ACEi/ARBs.

40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Polyethylene glycol-coated {{liposomal}} <b>blood</b> pool contrast <b>agents</b> maintain {{contrast enhancement}} over several hours. This study aimed to evaluate (long-term) imaging of pulmonary arteries, comparing conventional iodinated contrast with a liposomal <b>blood</b> pool contrast <b>agent.</b> Also, visualization of the (real-time) therapeutic effects of {{tissue plasminogen activator}} (t-PA) on pulmonary embolism (PE) was attempted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six rabbits (weight approximately 4 kg) had autologous blood clots injected through the superior vena cava. Imaging was performed using conventional contrast (iohexol, 350 mg I/ml; GE HealthCare, Princeton, NJ) at a dose of 1400 mg I per animal, and after wash-out, animals were imaged using an iodinated liposomal <b>blood</b> pool <b>agent</b> (88 mg I/mL, dose 900 mg I/animal). Subsequently, five animals were injected with 2 mg of t-PA and imaging continued for up to 4 (1 / 2) hours. RESULTS: Both contrast agents identified PE in the pulmonary trunk and main pulmonary arteries in all rabbits. Liposomal <b>blood</b> pool <b>agent</b> yielded uniform enhancement, which remained relatively constant throughout the experiments. Conventional agents exhibited nonuniform opacification and rapid clearance postinjection. Three of six rabbits had mistimed bolus injections, requiring repeat injections. Following t-PA, pulmonary embolus volume (central to segmental) decreased in four of five treated rabbits (range 10 - 57 %, mean 42 %). One animal showed no response to t-PA. CONCLUSIONS: Liposomal <b>blood</b> pool <b>agents</b> effectively identified acute PE without need for reinjection. PE resolution following t-PA was quantifiable over several hours. <b>Blood</b> pool <b>agents</b> offer the potential for repeated imaging procedures without need for repeated (nephrotoxic) contrast injections...|$|R
