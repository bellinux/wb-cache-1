40|$|<b>Biosimilar</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (<b>biosimilars)</b> {{have become}} a reality in the European Union and will soon be {{available}} in the United States. Despite an established legal pathway for biosimilars in the European Union since 2005 and increasing and detailed regulatory guidance on data requirements for their development and licensing, many clinicians, particularly oncologists, are reluctant to consider biosimilars as a treatment option for their patients. Major concerns voiced about biosimilars relate to their pharmaceutical quality, safety (especially immunogenicity), efficacy (particularly in extrapolated indications), and interchangeability with the originator product. In this article, the members and experts of the Working Party on Similar Biologic <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Products</b> of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) address these issues. A clear understanding of the scientific principles of the biosimilar concept and access to unbiased information on licensed biosimilars are important for physicians to make informed and appropriate treatment choices for their patients. This will become even more important with the advent of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies. The issues also highlight the need for improved communication between physicians, learned societies, and regulators...|$|R
30|$|To {{assure the}} {{biosafety}} {{and efficacy of}} biosimilars, the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) decided to develop requirements and guidance for registration of biosimilar drugs.

40|$|Introduction: Biological and <b>biosimilar</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have {{specific}} characteristics {{that call for}} a closer monitoring of their safety profile. Since the current legal framework stems from both European and national regulations, some gaps in the operational field may be expected. The goal {{of this paper is}} to identify these gaps and propose changes to the current information systems and pharmacovigilance regulations. Material and Methods: A qualitative analysis of current pharmacovigilance regulatory framework and supporting information system was conducted. Results: Current pharmacovigilance system does not seem to vouch for the safe use of biologicals and biosimilar drugs. The gaps found in reviewed materials may be attributable to their lack of specificity for biopharmaceuticals. Discussion: Biologicals therapy presents specific determinants related with the drugs, prescription, and traceability, without replication in any other segment of the pharmaceutical market. They are able to shape their safety profile. Conclusion: The existing pharmacovigilance’s regulatory framework should be adjusted in order to improve the safety related with biopharmaceutical therapy.

40|$|<b>Biosimilar</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{have become}} a reality in recent years. Despite an {{established}} legal pathway for biosimilars in the European Union since 2005 and increasing regulatory guidance on data requirements for their development and approval, many clinicians are still reluctant to consider biosimilars as a treatment option for their patients. Moreover, the approval of biosimilars has prompted the discussion of whether these products can be safely switched with the innovator biopharmaceuticals without {{a negative impact on}} the efficacy of the treatment or an increased risk of immunogenicity. This review gives an overview of the available data related to the switch between an originator product and a biosimilar. A search was conducted for pre- and post-approval clinical studies involving patients that were switched between innovator drugs and EMA approved biosimilars. Currently, there is limited clinical data that specifically investigates the effects of switching. Nevertheless, the data analyzed from clinical studies reporting on switching between originator products and their respective biosimilars indicates that switching has no impact on the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of treatment in patients...|$|R

40|$|Background: Slovenia aims to {{regulate}} and reimburse prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{in order to}} manage and reduce public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Two levels of reference prices (R) are used: external R with a regulated maximum price and internal R with a maximum attributed value, defined by reference pricing for interchangeable <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia covers expenses for their prescribed use and negotiates prices. The objective of our article was to confirm the basic thesis that the price regulation system and reimbursement have caused {{the decline in the}} regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Consequently, the decline in prices might contribute to a reduction of public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Methods: The research covered 760 regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for both groups of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed on an outpatient prescription and financed by public expenditures. The Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test are used to estimate the impact of wholesale price regulation system and reimbursement on the trends in nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the period 2003 – 2010. Results: The main thesis that the nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> declined during the years 2003 – 2010, was confirmed by the Laspeyres index. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test further confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences in the wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (p < 0. 05). With 5 % significance level, we can conclude that the regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed years. The regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices ofgeneric <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined more than the prices of original <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Conclusions: We have found that the analysed regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed period 2003 – 2010.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} multinational clinical research, regulatory requirements need to become international and harmonised. The EU introduced the Directive 2001 / 20 /EC in 2004, regulating investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in Europe. Methods We conducted a survey {{in order to identify}} the national regulatory requirements for major categories of clinical research in ten European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) countries-Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom-covering approximately 70 % of the EU population. Here we describe the results for regulatory requirements for typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> in the ten countries. Results Our results show that the ten countries have fairly harmonised definitions of typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Clinical trials assessing typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> require authorisation from a national competent authority in each of the countries surveyed. The opinion of the competent authorities is communicated to the trial sponsor within the same timelines, i. e., no more than 60 days, in all ten countries. The authority to which the application has to be sent to in the different countries is not fully harmonised. Conclusion The Directive 2001 / 20 /EC defined the term 'investigational medicinal product' and all regulatory requirements described therein are applicable to investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Our survey showed, however, that those requirements had been adopted in ten European countries, not for investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> overall, but rather a narrower category which we term 'typical' investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The result is partial EU harmonisation of requirements and a relatively navigable landscape for the sponsor regarding typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The main {{consequences}} for the veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> sector of the recent wave of liberalisation in Africa’s livestock sector have been a proliferation of operators, a diversification of product origin and a general decline in product quality. In this context, all the stakeholders involved agree that legislation on veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> needs to be harmonised among the African countries. Despite this consensus, however, the situation has not changed much in the countries themselves. In order to explore operational guidelines for harmonising national legislation in Africa, with particular reference to the registration and quality control of veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) drew up a status report on the member countries of the OIE Regional Commission for Africa based on the answers to a questionnaire. The report revealed that, even though {{a number of countries}} had developed legislative texts on <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> these texts vary widely from one country to another and in only a few cases are they specific to veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> In most cases, the implementing regulations are not properly enforced.

40|$|According to the European Medicine Agency, a “biosimilar” is a {{biological}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> {{that contains a}} version of the active substance of an original biological <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> (reference or innovative <b>medicinal</b> <b>product)</b> that has been authorized in the European Economic Area. The similarity to the reference <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> in terms of quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy needs to be set on a comprehensive comparability basis. The generic standard approach (demonstration of bioequivalence with a reference <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> by appropriate bioavailability studies), which is applicable {{to a wide range of}} chemically derived <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> is not sufficient to prove the similarity of biotechnology derived products due to their structural complexity. Furthermore, these biopharmaceuticals products, in comparison with the conventional ones, show a greater ability to activate the immune response. The evaluation of biosimilar medicines for authorisation purposes by the European Medicine Agency does not include recommendations on whether a biosimilar should be used interchangeably with its reference medicine. Substitution policies are, therefore, within the remit of the EU member states. In order to support pharmacovigilance monitoring, all appropriate measures should be taken to clearly identify any biological <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> with due regard to its brand name and batch number.
