40|$|We analyse the {{consequences}} on agricultural markets of {{enlargement of the}} European Union (EU) to include the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. We produce a market outlook up to 2010 for two enlargement scenarios assuming different policy restrictions on grain and dairy production in the acceding countries. Accession of the three Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) leads to a permanent but moderate decrease in EU prices for most commodities. In the three acceding CEECs, domestic prices increase drastically, final {{consumption of agricultural products}} decreases in most instances, while production increases. Higher domestic prices in the CEECs reduce exports of most commodities to non-union countries. Consequently, excess supplies are placed in stocks or exported to the original 15 member countries. Supply management mechanisms in the dairy and grain sectors would reduce the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>surpluses</b> in the new member states, but limit their ability {{to take advantage of the}} expanded market. Accession of the three CEECs would increase the CAP budget over its proposed maximum if area payments are extended to incoming crop producers. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2002. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the years}} before the global {{financial}} crisis of 2008 [...] 2010, Qatar experienced a huge <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> liquidity <b>surplus</b> in the banking system, mainly driven by surging net capital inflows. This paper identifies various sources of interbank liquidity in Qatar and discusses the various implications of structural primary liquidity surplus for the money market in particular and the economy at large. The paper attempts to evaluate the Qatar Central Bank policy making and conduct during the pre- and post-crisis periods within a framework of the Austrian monetary overinvestment theories, and concludes that the central bank had forcibly committed several forced monetary policy mistakes, {{which resulted in a}} breakdown in the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. This led to the inability of the central bank to control the interbank interest rate and to an accelerating inflation rate during the pre-crisis years. In contrast, a dramatic change in the central bank's monetary policy framework and a deliberate monetary policy mistake on behalf of the central bank resulted in a restoration of the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, stabilization of the interbank interest rate close to the central bank's policy rate and a sharp deceleration in the inflation rate in the post-crisis period. The paper concludes by offering brief policy recommendations. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the increasingly important roles of Asian official {{institutions in the}} new global financial landscape and the reasons {{that have led to}} the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> massive public <b>surpluses.</b> We re-examine the role of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) as the de facto "global lender of last resort" during the recent financial crisis. Specifically, we analyze SWFs’ balance sheet characteristics, target allocations strategies, strategic agendas and political realities, management philosophies, and other real-world challenges, {{both before and after the}} crisis. Part of our analysis incorporates data which includes announced deals, regulatory filings, balance sheet information, and actual performance data made available by specific SWFs. We also point out a logical inconsistency in the common application of the Berk-Green alpha argument to the management of SWFs. For instance, the recent work done by Ang, Goetzmann, and Schaefer (2009) suggests limited or no evidence that alpha-seeking activities have impacts on SWF performance. We argue that the problem may be partially due to the choice of an appropriate performance benchmark for such large, non-commercial mandates. Finally, we propose a set of principles to construct a fair performance benchmark for SWFs. sovereign wealth funds; global financial crisis; public surpluses; global financial system...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{models for}} {{predicting}} <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> solute on membrane surface were formulated in this paper. The experiments {{were conducted with}} secondary effluent, groundwater and simulated feed water in small-scale of RO with capacity of 2000 L/d. Feed water used in the experiments contained varying concentrations of sodium, calcium, combined sodium and calcium. In order to study the effect of sodium and calcium ions on membrane performance, experiments with ground water and secondary effluent wastewater were also performed. <b>Build-up</b> <b>of</b> salts on the membrane surface was calculated by measuring concentrations of sodium and calcium ions in feed water permeate and reject streams using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). Multiple linear regression of natural logarithmic transformation was used to develop the model based on four main parameters that affect the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> solute in a small scale of RO namely applied pressure, permeate flux, membrane resistance, and feed concentration. Experimental data obtained in a small scale RO unit were used to develop the empirical model. The predicted values <b>of</b> theoretical <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> sodium and calcium on membrane surface were found in agreement with experimental data. The deviation in the prediction <b>of</b> <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> sodium and calcium {{were found to be}} 1. 4 to 10. 47 % and 1. 12 to 4. 46 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} step in the transition towards a hydrogen-based energy system is the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen infrastructure. The <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> this hydrogen infrastructure is strongly hampered through all kinds of technological-, economic-, political- and institutional barriers. This research project focuses on the institutional barriers that hamper the development of hydrogen infrastructure in the Corridor. The institutional barriers can be addressed {{by means of an}} institutional support scheme (ISS). An institutional support scheme consists out of three institutional support mechanisms; financial incentives, regulations, and other support measures.

50|$|To better {{understand}} the rate <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> value one must {{understand that there are}} two parts to the working day. One part of the working day is the time necessary in order to produce the value of the workers labor power. The second part of the working day is surplus labor time, which produces no value for the laborer, but produces value for the capitalist. The rate <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> value is a ratio <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> labor time (s) to necessary labor time (v). The rate <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> value (s/v) is also referred to by Marx as the rate of exploitation.|$|R
40|$|Urban {{water quality}} can be {{significantly}} impaired by the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> pollutants such as heavy metals and volatile organics on urban road surfaces due to vehicular traffic. Any control {{strategy for the}} mitigation <b>of</b> traffic related <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> heavy metals and volatile organic pollutants {{should be based on}} the knowledge <b>of</b> their <b>build-up</b> processes. In the study discussed in this paper, the outcomes of a detailed experiment investigation into <b>build-up</b> processes <b>of</b> heavy metals and volatile organics are presented. It was found that traffic parameters such as average daily traffic, volume over capacity ratio and surface texture depth had similar strong correlations with the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> heavy metals and volatile organics. Multicriteria decision analyses revealed that the 1 - 74 um particulate fraction of total suspended solids (TSS) could be regarded as a surrogate indicator for particulate heavy metals in build-up and this same fraction of total organic carbon could be regarded as a surrogate indicator for particulate volatile organics <b>build-up.</b> In terms <b>of</b> pollutants affinity, TSS was found to be the predominant parameter for particulate heavy metals build-up and total dissolved solids was found to be the predominant parameter for he potential dissolved particulate fraction in heavy metals build-up. It was also found that land use did not {{play a significant role in}} the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> traffic generated heavy metals and volatile organics...|$|R
