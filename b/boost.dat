5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown is {{a racing}} video game with arcade-style {{gameplay}} that emphasises dangerous and fast-paced driving. The game features standard circuit races which {{take place on}} carriageways and city streets populated with traffic. The Single Race mode pits the player against five AI opponents in a single or multiple lap race. During a race, <b>boost,</b> which is earned by acts of reckless driving such as drifting around corners, near misses with traffic, and driving in oncoming lanes, {{can be used to}} rapidly increase a car's speed. <b>Boost</b> can be used immediately in Burnout 3, unlike previous Burnout games which required the <b>boost</b> meter to be full. The quickest method for earning <b>boost</b> is a Takedown—a central mechanic introduced in this instalment of the series. A Takedown involves shunting opposing vehicles until they crash. Each one fills the <b>boost</b> meter and can provide an additional <b>boost</b> segment, causing the meter to extend up to four times its initial size. Ramming opponents will cause them to behave more aggressively in return; their level of hostility is indicated by a coloured arrow above their vehicle. When the player crashes or is taken out by an opponent, <b>boost</b> is lost and a bonus <b>boost</b> segment is withdrawn. During the crash sequence, a slow-motion mode called Impact Time can be activated. In Impact Time, the Aftertouch mechanic can be used to manoeuvre the wrecked car chassis into an opponent to get a Takedown, which acts as recovery move by negating the penalty of crashing.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests on the engine fuel system showed that when the engine <b>boost</b> pump was operating, a vortex formed in the engine fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the <b>boost</b> pump was turned off, the vortex dissipated and any water would soon find its way into the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine <b>boost</b> pumps would be turned off.|$|E
40|$|<b>Boosting</b> {{has been}} shown to improve the {{performance}} of classifiers in many situations, including when data is im-balanced. There are, however, two possible implementa-tions of <b>boosting,</b> and it is unclear which should be used. <b>Boosting</b> by reweighting is typically used, but can only be applied to base learners which are designed to handle ex-ample weights. On the other hand, <b>boosting</b> by resampling can be applied to any base learner. In this work, we empir-ically evaluate the differences between these two <b>boosting</b> implementations using imbalanced training data. Using 10 <b>boosting</b> algorithms, 4 learners and 15 datasets, we find that <b>boosting</b> by resampling performs as well as, or signif-icantly better than, <b>boosting</b> by reweighting (which is of-ten the default <b>boosting</b> implementation). We therefore con-clude that in general, <b>boosting</b> by resampling is preferred over <b>boosting</b> by weighting. ...|$|R

Compared with binary <b>boosting</b> classification, multi-class <b>boosting</b> received less attention. We propose a novel multi-class <b>boosting</b> formulation here. Unlike most previous multi-class <b>boosting</b> algorithms which decompose a multi-boost problem into multiple independent binary <b>boosting</b> problems, we formulate a direct optimization method for training multi-class <b>boosting.</b> Moreover, by explicitly deriving the Lagrange dual of the formulated primal optimization problem, we design totally-corrective <b>boosting</b> using the column generation technique in convex optimization. At each iteration, all weak classifiers’ weights are updated. Our experiments on various data sets demonstrate that our direct multi-class <b>boosting</b> achieves competitive test accuracy compared with state-of-the-art multi-class <b>boosting</b> in the literature.

By this means, the resulting classifier consists of fewer weak classifiers yet achieves lower error rates than <b>boosting</b> cascade in both training and test.

40|$|<b>Boosted</b> {{decision}} trees typically yield good accuracy, precision, and ROC area. However, {{because the}} outputs from <b>boosting</b> {{are not well}} calibrated posterior probabilities, <b>boosting</b> yields poor squared error and cross-entropy. We empirically demonstrate why AdaBoost predicts distorted probabilities and examine three calibration methods for correcting this distortion: Platt Scaling, Isotonic Regression, and Logistic Correction. We also experiment with <b>boosting</b> using log-loss {{instead of the usual}} exponential loss. Experiments show that Logistic Correction and <b>boosting</b> with log-loss work well when <b>boosting</b> weak models such as decision stumps, but yield poor performance when <b>boosting</b> more complex models such as full decision trees. Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression, however, significantly improve the probabilities predicted by both <b>boosted</b> stumps and <b>boosted</b> trees. After calibration, <b>boosted</b> full decision trees predict better probabilities than other learning methods such as SVMs, neural nets, bagged decision trees, and KNNs, even after these methods are calibrated...|$|R
40|$|<b>Boosting</b> is an {{iterative}} process that improves the predictive accuracy for supervised (machine) learning algorithms. <b>Boosting</b> operates by learning multiple functions with subsequent functions focusing on incorrect instances where the previous functions predicted the wrong label. Despite considerable success, <b>boosting</b> still has difficulty on data sets with {{certain types of}} problematic training data (e. g., label noise) and when complex functions overfit the training data. We propose a novel cluster-based <b>boosting</b> (CBB) approach to address limitations in <b>boosting</b> for supervised learning systems. Our CBB approach partitions the training data into clusters containing highly similar member data and integrates these clusters directly into the <b>boosting</b> process. CBB <b>boosts</b> selectively (using a high learning rate, low learning rate, or not <b>boosting)</b> on each cluster based on both the additional structure provided by the cluster and previous function accuracy on the member data. Selective <b>boosting</b> allows CBB to improve predictive accuracy on problematic training data. In addition, <b>boosting</b> separately on clusters reduces function complexity to mitigate overfitting. We provide comprehensive experimental results on 20 UCI benchmark data sets with three different kinds of supervised learning systems. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CBB approach compared to a popular <b>boosting</b> algorithm, an algorithm that uses clusters to improve <b>boosting,</b> and two algorithms that use selective <b>boosting</b> without clustering...|$|R
