40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{unmanned}} merchant vessels are possible, and researchers have claimed that larger autonomous vessels can be seen within 10 years. For oceangoing vessels, {{one of the biggest}} challenges is to get systems and machinery to work reliably for up to 4 weeks without maintenance. Therefore, a need to identify the systems that can be solely maintained in port, and those systems that will require redesign is present. Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) is a procedure that determines what must be done to ensure that any physical asset continuous to do whatever its users wants it to do in its present operating context. The procedure is a thorough process that identifies critical failures for an asset in its operating context, and determines whether maintenance tasks can reduce the risk to an acceptable level. If no maintenance tasks are found to be applicable and effective in the operating context, the process requires one-time changes, such as redesign, modification or change of the item s operating context. For an oceangoing merchant vessel that is to be used in a new operating context, where no maintenance will be possible for up to four weeks, the procedure can be used to identify the critical failures and whether the risk can be reduced by means of maintenance, or if one-time changes are necessary. In this thesis, those critical failures that cannot be managed effectively by maintenance has been defined as barriers. This thesis establishes a step-by-step procedure for how to use RCM principles for identification of barriers. The procedure is considered to be a very useful tool for identifying and breaking barriers in design of unmanned engine rooms for merchant vessels. However, to effectively and successfully perform the procedure, a group consisting of an RCM facilitator well versed in RCM principles and experts with in-depth knowledge about the systems is strongly recommended. The procedure is used in a case study to identify barriers in a fuel oil system that uses HFO, as this is the most common fuel used today on oceangoing merchant vessels. The analysis has been performed on the fuel system under normal seagoing conditions, and the functional failure analysed is Supplies no fuel to the engine. As the RCM process only focuses on the maintenance, other procedures the crew may have such as opening and closing of hand-operated valves falls outside of the scope. Four barriers were identified in the analysis: plugging of the <b>by-pass</b> <b>filter,</b> plugging of the ME automatic backflush filter, plugging of the transfer pump filter and plugging of the flowmeter filter. These failure modes are identified as barriers because cleaning of the filters too often are required less than 4 weeks after the last cleaning. As the operating context states that maintenance cannot be performed at intervals less than 4 weeks, and the risk is considered to be unacceptable, the failures are considered to be barriers. The conclusion is therefore that one-time changes such as redesign, modification or change of operating context for the fuel system is necessary in order for an oceangoing merchant vessel to be able to sail without maintenance personnel with an acceptable risk. As the frequency of cleaning tasks are a direct function of the condition of the fuel, a one-time change that can be effective on all identified barriers is change of fuel. A comparison made with an FMECA analysis from a vessel running on diesel fuel indicate that this will have a significant effect...|$|E
40|$|As {{the amount}} of content on the Web grows almost exponentially, {{one of the new}} growth {{industries}} is that of filtering products. The effectiveness of Web-filtering software depends on a number of factors including the architecture of the software itself, and the sophistication of the users operating within its application domain. The main use of filtering software is to “block” access to controversial content such as pornography. This paper reports an investigation of the effectiveness of a filter called squidGuard in the real-world environment of an Australian University. The product is used to “block” pornographic material. This investigation simulates three classes of web users in trying to access pornography. While squidGuard did have limited success in blocking such material from novice users, the blocking rate dropped dramatically for the more experienced users using access lists. In all cases, however, access to supposedly filtered material was gained in seconds. Under such testing, the effectiveness of squidGuard as a specific-content filter for “pornographic” material can only be seen as superficial approach at best. The use of anonymous proxy servers was found to be an easy means to <b>by-pass</b> the <b>filter...</b>|$|R
40|$|London Ltd is {{used for}} {{sampling}} respirable dusts on to either 37 or 25 mm diameter filters. Potential leak problems using the 25 mm holder have been investigated here. Two sources of leaks may cause errors: (1) external leaks into the grit pot, or into the 25 mm filter holder, allow air to by-pass the cyclone {{and as a result}} large particles which should be removed by it are deposited directly on the filter, so that the amount of respirable dust in the air is overestimated; and (2) internal leaks due to a poor seal between the filter and the holder <b>by-pass</b> the <b>filter</b> and result in the respirable dust concentration being underestimated. A crude check for external leaks can be made by placing a finger over the cyclone inlet. The pump should stall if there are no leaks. If there is a gross leak, e. g. a split in the rubber grit pot, the pump will not be loaded and this can be readily heard. A more sophisticated, yet convenient, method of checking for both types of leaks is presented. It assumes the use of a calibrator pack, e. g. Dupont. Internal leaks are revealed by measuring the pressure drop across the filter in a leaktight holder, an...|$|R
40|$|On the Internet, attackers can {{compromise}} systems {{owned by}} other people and then use these systems to launch attacks automatically. When attacks such as phishing or SQL injections are successful, they can have negative consequences including server down-time {{and the loss of}} sensitive information. Current methods to prevent such attacks are limited in that they are application-specific, or fail to block attack-ers. Phishing attempts can be stopped with email filters, but if the attacker manages to successfully <b>by-pass</b> these <b>filters,</b> then the user must determine if the email is legitimate or not. Unfortunately, they of-ten are unable to do so. Since attackers have a low success rate, they attempt to compensate for it in vol-ume. In order to have this high throughput, attack-ers take shortcuts and break protocols. We use this knowledge to address these issues by implementing a system that can detect malicious activity and use it to block attacks. If the client fails to follow proper pro-cedure, they can be classified as an attacker. Once an attacker has been discovered, they are isolated and monitored. This can be accomplished using ex-isting software in Ubuntu Linux applications, along with our custom wrapper application. After running the system and seeing its performance on three pop-ular Web browsers Chromium, Firefox and Internet Explorer as well as two popular email clients Thun-derbird and Evolution, we found that not only is this system conceivable, it is effective and has low over-head. ...|$|R
40|$|Metastases are {{the most}} common tumors of the central nervous system which may lie dormant behind the brain blood- barrier {{sheltering}} from chemiotherapeutic drugs, and whose presence usually indicates a poor prognosis. Development of brain metastases includes the intravasation of the cancer cells through the tumor blood vessels, their circulation within the venous system, passing through the pulmonary filter thus reaching the systemic circulation. Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a natural communication between the right and left atrium with a prevalence of about 25 % in the general population. It may predispose to a right-to-left shunt <b>by-passing</b> the pulmonary <b>filter.</b> Recent literature suggests that the presence of a permanent shunt, large shunt, atrial septal aneurysm and/or venous valve remnants, all increase the risk of paradoxical embolism in PFO patients.

In exchange for shelter (domatia) and food, mutualistic plant-ants protect their host myrmecophytes from herbivores, encroaching vines and fungal pathogens.

This {{is the case in}} French Guiana for Cecropia obtusa (Cecropiaceae) as Pseudocabima guianalis caterpillars (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae) can colonize saplings before the installation of their mutualistic Azteca ants. The caterpillars shelter in the domatia and feed on food bodies (FBs) whose production increases as a result. They delay colonization by ants by weaving a silk shield above the youngest trichilium, where the FBs are produced, blocking access to them. This probable temporal priority effect also allows female moths to lay new eggs on trees that already shelter caterpillars, and so to occupy the niche longer and exploit Cecropia resources before colonization by ants. However, once incipient ant colonies are able to develop, they prevent further colonization by the caterpillars. Although no higher herbivory rates were noted, these caterpillars are ineffective in protecting their host trees from a pathogenic fungus, Fusarium moniliforme (Deuteromycetes), that develops on the trichilium in the absence of mutualistic ants. Therefore, the Cecropia treelets can be parasitized by two often overlooked species: the caterpillars that shelter in the domatia and feed o...|$|R

The current study has multiple objectives, which include developing a microwave assisted particulate filter regeneration system for future generation light-duty diesel applications, including PNGV type applications. A variable power 2. 0 kW microwave system and a tuned waveguide were employed. Cavity geometry is being optimized {{with the aid of}} computational modeling and temperature measurements during microwave heating. A wall-flow ceramic-fiber filter with superior thermal shock resistance, high filtration efficiency, and high soot capacity was used. The microwave assisted particulate filter regeneration system has operated for more than 100 hours in an engine test-cell with a 5. 9 -liter diesel engine with automated split exhaust flow and <b>by-pass</b> flow capabilities. <b>Filter</b> regeneration was demonstrated using soot loads up to 10 g/liter and engine exhaust at idling flow rates as the oxygen source.

30|$|During {{the initial}} {{part of the}} study, the only {{chemical}} dosed was sulfuric acid, which was used to maintain the feed pH to about 6.7 so as to prevent scaling. However, {{during the course of}} the baseline study (first trial), it was found that all measures taken to accelerate membrane fouling (as evident by performance decline) had failed. These measures included increasing the membrane flux, <b>by-passing</b> the sand <b>filter</b> as well as increasing the recovery. Another approach involved increasing the feed pH to a higher value to accelerate the decline in the membrane performance by inducing scaling. This was done gradually by reducing the acid dosing rate which resulted in an increase of feed pH from 6.7 to the natural pH of seawater of about 8. However, there was no significant impact, as was evident from the performance decline results as well as autopsy studies. The last two baseline studies (second and third trial) were completed without dosing acid or any chemicals, especially, the third trial, which was extended up to 70  days. This result indicates that even at a recovery of 30  %, SWRO membranes can operate smoothly on Gulf seawater feed without the addition of scale control chemicals.|$|R
