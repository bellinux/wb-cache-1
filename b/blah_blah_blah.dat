500|$|The lyrical {{reference}} points in [...] are all quite interesting—if {{you consider the}} youth-obsessed reference collaborators {{of the first two}} singles and how uncomfortable it all feels. 'Superstar' offers a glimpse of something far more comfortable in its own skin. All the {{reference points}} will mean very little to your average 17-year-old. We suppose the idea is that they're icons whose imagery transcends generations <b>blah</b> <b>blah</b> <b>blah</b> but after all the aggressive positioning of the first two singles it's great to hear Madonna relaxing into this sort of song. The lyrics about being in love are a bit soppy but love makes you go a bit soppy sometimes.|$|E

It doesn't explain or <b>blah,</b> <b>blah,</b> <b>blah.</b> … It's confirmed like, she's a witch, but there was such a touch of humanity. When she went to the bed and got into the bed and covered herself up… it was like a really striking moment in this weird madness of humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} non-Nordic Viking metal bands was the German project Falkenbach. Formed in 1989 and {{primarily}} the work of front-man Vratyas Vakyas, Falkenbach performs a mixture of black metal and folk music, with lyrics drawing from Western and Northern European mythologies, religions, and folk traditions. The Dutch bands Heidevolk, Slechtvalk, and Fenris have also been labeled as Viking metal, though Heidevolk's former vocalist Joris Boghtdrincker claims that Heidevolk has never tried to [...] "play the Viking card or the Pan-Germanic card", instead choosing to write about local Dutch history. The Swiss band Eluveitie jokingly calls its music [...] "the new wave of folk metal", which vocalist Chrigel Glanzmann explains was because the [...] "whole folk metal thing was still quite new back then, and the scene and the music press was looking for new labels {{for that kind of}} music, so they came up with Forest Metal, Viking Metal, Heathen Metal, Pagan Metal, <b>blah</b> <b>blah</b> <b>blah,</b> and we just felt like it was really really ridiculous." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Hush" [...] explores issues {{relating}} to the limits and benefits of language and communication. During the first act of the episode, the characters are presented as being overwhelmed by language that is misused, used as white noise, and employed {{as a means of}} avoiding truth. Many of the conversations between characters, even those that are seemingly insignificant to the episode's plot or to the show's overall history, deal in some way with various aspects or forms of communication. Whedon stated that he was unaware of how [...] "inevitably coherent" [...] this theme was until after the script was completed. Buffy and Riley are unable to act upon their attraction because they cannot stop babbling, primarily to keep their true identities concealed from each other, but also to avoid becoming closer emotionally. Xander is unable or unwilling to express what Anya means to him, and Anya, still new at interacting with humans, uses blunt, often rude language that distances herself from all the other characters. Giles desperately wants the others to stop talking. Willow considers the women in the Wicca group to be nonsensical, later complaining to Buffy [...] "Talk, all talk. <b>Blah</b> <b>blah</b> Gaia. <b>Blah</b> <b>blah</b> moon, menstrual lifeforce power thingy. You know after a couple sessions I was hoping we would get into something real, but..." [...] These pseudo conversations are what Buffy essayists Alice Jenkins and Susan Stuart refer to as [...] "locutionary acts": language that is formed to have meaning but does not engage the listener.|$|R

Samples from the Iggy Pop version were incorporated into the theme music for the ABC's long-running late-night music video show Rage, which premiered in 1987, and the opening credits of the show include footage of O'Keefe on stage.|$|E
2500|$|Pop's {{follow-up}} to <b>Blah</b> <b>Blah</b> <b>Blah,</b> Instinct (1988), was a turnaround in musical direction. Its stripped-back, guitar-based sound leaned further towards {{the sound of}} the Stooges than any of his solo albums to date. His record label dropped him, but the King Biscuit radio show recorded the Instinct tour (featuring guitarist Andy McCoy and Alvin Gibbs on bass) in Boston on July 19, 1988. Working with rock attorney Stann Findelle, Pop scored more movie soundtrack inclusions in 1989: [...] "Living on the Edge of the Night" [...] in the Ridley Scott thriller Black Rain; and [...] "Love Transfusion", a song originally written by Alice Cooper (who does backing vocals) and Desmond Child, in Wes Craven's Shocker.|$|E
2500|$|Henry's former Arsenal {{manager and}} Frenchman Arsène Wenger {{said of the}} {{incident}} that [...] "This isn't the French way and football should learn from this", although he theorised that Henry did not inform the referee due to [...] "the pressure and what's at stake". Wenger later added, [...] "For the sense of justice it is quite embarrassing to see...I think even France is embarrassed...we won the game and won the qualification with a goal {{that was not a}} goal". Wenger believed Henry, {{who was one of the}} [...] "fairest [...] I've managed", was being unfairly left to face criticism by France, and that the real issue was the lack of technology being in place. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was of the opinion that [...] "every player and manager in the world" [...] thinks that [...] "technology can play a part" [...] to help referees, but recognised that it was FIFA who had to be convinced. Henry's club manager of Barcelona, Pep Guardiola said as Henry returned to training in Spain that he [...] "is not proud to have done that, but it wasn't premeditated", and gave guarded support for use of video refereeing. German Robert Huth expressed sympathy with the Irish, but on the merits of a replay, contrasted the lack of a replay after the controversial goal in the 1966 World Cup final. Danish goalkeeper Brian Jensen said [...] "He didn't do it on purpose? <b>Blah</b> <b>blah</b> <b>blah.</b> My 'beep'. I won't say the word cheats – but ... I said it".|$|E

2500|$|British {{newspapers}} The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph both {{reported that}} [...] "The End" [...] had received negative reviews and disappointed its viewers. Alan Sepinwall of Star-Ledger was less enthusiastic of the finale, stating [...] "I'm still wrestling with my feelings about 'The End'... I thought {{most of it}} worked like gangbusters. ... But as someone who did spend {{at least part of}} the last six years dwelling on the questions that were unanswered—be they little things like the outrigger shootout or why The Others left Dharma in charge of the Swan station after the purge, or bigger ones like Walt—I can't say I found 'The End' wholly satisfying, either as closure for this season or the series. ... There are narrative dead ends in every season of 'Lost,' but it felt like season six had more than usual." [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times gave [...] "The End" [...] a mixed review, as the episode showed that the series was [...] "shaky on the big picture—on organizing the welter of mythic-religious-philosophical material it insisted on incorporating into its plot—but highly skilled at the small one, the moment to moment business of telling an exciting story. Rendered insignificant ... were the particulars of what they had done on the island." [...] David Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun gave the episode a highly negative review, writing [...] "If this is supposed to be such a smart and wise show, unlike anything else on network TV (<b>blah,</b> <b>blah,</b> <b>blah),</b> why such a wimpy, phony, quasi-religious, white-light, huggy-bear ending. ... Once Jack stepped into the church it looked like he was walking into a Hollywood wrap party without food or music—just a bunch of actors grinning idiotically for 10 minutes and hugging one another." ...|$|E
