[...] No 2 Set the precedent for Steam On The Electric being used in construction by the Isle of Man Tramways & Electric Power Co. (there are two photographs illustrating this). No. 2 is the only locomotive on the railway to have been lost to the pages of history, only a pony truck survives today, {{and it is difficult}} to surmise if this was originally No. 2's as so many parts were interchanged on the locomotives. [...] She was withdrawn in 1951 and dismantled at the time for use as spare parts for the other smaller class locomotives. [...] The Frames having survived in store for many years were scrapped in 1980 by [...] "Pat the Rat" [...] (a local scrapman) at the behest of the then manager Bill Jackson. The surviving pony truck was for many years at the end of Birkenhead Siding at Port Erin with No. 4 Try These chalked on it, and is currently in store as a final reminder of the only engine to not exist in one form or another.|$|E
2500|$|Another one-off {{order from}} 1910 (Beyer, Peacock works number 5382), and {{named after a}} company director; unlucky 13 (latterly {{referred}} to as 12a {{by some of the}} railway's staff) was one of the backbones of the railway's fleet, having seldom been out of service until withdrawn with defective boiler at Christmas 1992; the boiler was refurbished and placed in the frames of No. 10 G.H.Wood which re-entered service as part of the Year of Railways in 1993 but No. 13 was left in dismantled form and stored.

50|$|As the Perth {{railway network}} grew {{it became clear}} that the C class had {{insufficient}} fuel capacity. Both were rebuilt as 0-6-0STT saddle-tank tender engines with a small four-wheeled tender and new cylinders. This conversion necessitated the removal of the <b>back</b> <b>cab</b> wall. The original coal bunkers and cab front were retained although the bunkers were not used for coal storage.|$|E

5000|$|The early Lark four-door sedan's {{body was}} used to create the cab section of the 1960 Studebaker Champ pickup, Studebaker's last [...] "all-new" [...] truck design. A new <b>back</b> <b>cab</b> wall was created, with the front doors, {{dashboard}} and front sheetmetal largely unaltered {{from those of the}} car. A more [...] "truck-like" [...] grille was added to the Champ, but otherwise the bodies of the 1959-60 Larks and all Champs built from 1960 to 1964 share a great deal of their body components. In fact, some export market Champs were even built on the long-wheelbase Cruiser chassis instead of the truck chassis. None were sold in the U.S.|$|E
5000|$|Technology: It is the Saurer F006 {{turned into}} an {{off-road}} passenger vehicle with four-wheel drive. The concept {{was adopted by the}} automaker Monteverdi, improved by Berna engineering company of Olten, Switzerland. Saurer took over the production. The axles are from IHC Scout (Jeep I scout from International Harvester). The vehicle had a plastic body made of polyester. For power the drive-train was a 6-cylinder petrol engine from Volvo with an automatic transmission. Maximum speed was 100 km/h. Overall styling contrasted to the Mercedes G and Puch 230GE joint venture vehicle with the front turn signals mounted conventionally {{on the front of the}} vehicle (and not on the hood). The equipment installed in the front bumper parking lights can be turned by flicking the [...] "Tarnlicht" [...] switch (a multipurpose military switch for light dimming). The basic vehicle has a fixed open <b>back</b> <b>cab.</b> The loading / passenger seats are closed with a fast mountable / demountable plastic sheet at the rear including a military holder for a gas canister; a fixed structure is provided for use in case of fire.|$|E
