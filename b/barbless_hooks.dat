25|$|In some jurisdictions, in the Canadian {{province}} of Manitoba, for example, catch and release is mandatory for some {{species such as}} brook trout. Many of the jurisdictions which mandate the live release of sport fish also {{require the use of}} artificial lures and <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> to minimise the chance of injury to fish. Mandatory catch and release also exists in the Republic of Ireland where it was introduced as a conservation measure to prevent the decline of Atlantic salmon stocks on some rivers. In Switzerland, catch and release fishing is considered inhumane and was banned in September 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Australian bass {{fishermen}} {{almost exclusively}} practice catch and release, which {{is necessary for}} the preservation of wild Australian bass stocks. [...] The use of <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> (which can be created by crushing the barbs flat with a pair of needle-nosed pliers) is essential as Australian bass hit lures with great ferocity and are consequently almost impossible to unhook on barbed hooks. [...] Conversely, Australian bass are swiftly and easily released if <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> are used.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Barbless</b> <b>hooks,</b> {{which can}} be created from a {{standard}} hook by removing the barb with pliers or can be bought, are sometimes resisted by anglers {{because they believe that}} increased escapement results. <b>Barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> reduce handling time, thereby increasing survival. [...] Concentrating on keeping the line taut while fighting fish, using recurved point or [...] "triple grip" [...] style hooks on lures, and equipping lures that do not have them with split rings can significantly reduce escapement.|$|E
50|$|The lake {{itself is}} a very popular fishing hole and may be fished from shore or paddle boat (motors are {{prohibited}}). Additionally, fishing with bait is prohibited (lures only) and all lures may contain only a single <b>barbless</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Clearwater River {{remained}} almost {{devoid of}} fish {{for the next}} 30 years. An assessment in 1992 showed that the river downstream from the Mahood confluence had far fewer fish than upstream, proving the serious effect of the Clearwater River Road. In 1994, new regulations came into effect which called for catch and release, a bait ban, a single <b>barbless</b> <b>hook,</b> and no fishing prior to July 15 each year. Another 10 years passed before the fishing improved, but in 2010 the regulations were still being enforced. These rules apply only to the Clearwater River downstream from Clearwater Lake.|$|R
6000|$|The Japs are the {{greatest}} market fishermen in the world. And some five hundred boats put out of San Pedro every day, to scour the ocean for [...] "the chicken of the sea," [...] as albacore are advertised {{to the millions of}} people who are always hungry. It must be said that the Japs mostly fish square. They use a <b>hook,</b> and a <b>barbless</b> <b>hook</b> at that. Usually four Japs constitute the crew of one of these fast eighty-horse-power motor-boats. They roam the sea with sharp eyes ever alert for that thin white line on the horizon, the feeding albacore. Their method of fishing is unique and picturesque. When they sight albacore they run up on the school and slow down.|$|R
2500|$|Some [...] "catch and release" [...] anglers flatten the barb {{of their}} hook. Such [...] "barbless hooks" [...] are {{much easier to}} remove from the fish (and from the angler, {{in the event of}} mishap). Many rivers with special {{regulations}} mandate that fishermen use <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> in an effort to conserve a healthy fish population.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he rounded {{alongside}} the skiff. It {{had been torn}} from the line, a section of which was dragging to it.

5000|$|The use of <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> is an {{important}} aspect of catch and release; <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> reduce injury and handling time, increasing survival. Frequently, fish caught on <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> can be released without being removed from the water, and the hook(s) effortlessly slipped out with a single flick of the pliers or leader. <b>Barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> can be purchased from several major manufacturers or can be created from a standard hook by crushing the barb(s) flat with needle-nosed pliers. Some anglers avoid <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> because of the erroneous belief that too many fish will escape. Concentrating on keeping the line tight at all times while fighting fish, equipping lures that do not have them with split rings, and using recurved point or [...] "Triple Grip" [...] style hooks on lures, will keep catch rates with <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> as high as those achieved with barbed hooks.|$|E
25|$|Pole {{and line}} vessels – are used mainly to catch tuna and skipjack. The fishers {{stand at the}} railing or on special {{platforms}} and fish with poles and lines. The lines have hooks which are baited, preferably with live bait. Caught tuna are swung on board, by two to three fishermen if the tuna is big, or with an automated swinging mechanism. The tuna usually release themselves from the <b>barbless</b> <b>hook</b> {{when they hit the}} deck. Tanks with live bait are placed round the decks, and water spray systems are used to attract the fish. The vessels are 15 to 45 metres o/a. On smaller vessels fishers fish from the main deck right around the boat. With larger vessels, there are two different deck styles: the American style and the Japanese style.|$|R
2500|$|The hook {{point is}} {{probably}} {{the most important part of}} the hook. It is the point that must penetrate fish flesh and secure the fish. The profile of the hook point and its length influence how well the point penetrates. The barb influences how far the point penetrates, how much pressure is required to penetrate and ultimately the holding power of the hook. Hook points are mechanically (ground) or chemically sharpened. Some <b>hooks</b> are <b>barbless.</b> Historically, many ancient fish <b>hooks</b> were <b>barbless,</b> but today a <b>barbless</b> <b>hook</b> is used to make hook removal and fish release less stressful on the fish. Hook points are also described relative to their offset from the hook shank. A kirbed hook point is offset to the left, a straight point has no offset and a reversed point is offset to the right.|$|R
5000|$|The last {{ruler of}} the Shang dynasty, King Zhou of Shang (16th - 11th century BC) was a tyrannical and debauched slave owner who spent his days carousing with his {{favourite}} concubine Daji and mercilessly executing or punishing upright officials and all others who objected to his ways. After faithfully serving the Shang court for approximately twenty years, Jiang came to find King Zhou insufferable, and feigned madness in order to escape court life and the ruler's power. Jiang was an expert in military affairs and hoped that someday someone would call on him to help overthrow the king. Jiang disappeared, only to resurface in the Zhou countryside at the apocryphal age of seventy-two, when he was recruited by King Wen of Zhou and became instrumental in Zhou affairs. [...] It is said that, while in exile, he continued to wait placidly, fishing in {{a tributary of the}} Wei River (near today’s Xi'an) using a <b>barbless</b> <b>hook</b> or even no hook at all, on the theory that the fish would come to him of their own volition when they were ready.|$|R

60|$|In {{the stern}} of the boat stands a huge tank, usually painted red. I have become used to seeing dots of red all over the ocean. This tank is kept full of fresh sea-water by a pump {{connected}} with the engine, and it is used to keep live bait--no other than the little anchovies. One Jap, using a little net, dips up live bait and throws them overboard to the albacore. Another Jap beats on the water with long bamboo poles, making splashes. The other two Japs have short, stiff poles with a wire attached and the <b>barbless</b> <b>hook</b> at the end. They put on a live bait and toss it over. Instantly they jerk hard, and two big white albacore, from fifteen to thirty pounds, come wiggling up on to {{the stern of}} the boat. Down goes the pole and whack! goes a club. It is all done with swift mechanical precision. It used to amaze me and fill me with sadness. If the Japs could hold the school of albacore they would very soon load the boat. But usually a school of albacore cannot be held long.|$|R
50|$|To make a <b>hook</b> <b>barbless,</b> the barb {{is simply}} crushed flat {{with a pair}} of needle-nosed pliers, a trivial task. Medium grit {{sandpaper}} can be further used to ensure complete removal of the barb, but this is not necessary and is rarely done.|$|R

Care needs to be taken when handling hooks as they can 'hook' the user. If a hook goes in deep enough below the barb, pulling the hook out will tear the flesh. There are three methods to remove a hook. The first is by cutting the flesh to remove it. The second is to cut the eye of the hook off and then push the remainder of the hook through the flesh and the third is to place pressure on the shank towards the flesh which pulls the barb into the now oval hole then push the hook out the way it came in.|$|R

40|$|The genetically unique {{population}} of muskellunge Esox masquinongy inhabiting Shoepack Lake in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, is potentially {{at risk for}} loss of genetic variability and long-term viability. Shoepack Lake has been subject to dramatic surface area changes from {{the construction of an}} outlet dam by beavers Castor canadensis and its subsequent failure. We simulated the long-term dynamics of this population in response to recruitment variation, increased exploitation, and reduced habitat area. We then estimated the effective population size of the simulated population and evaluated potential threats to long-term viability, based on which we recommend management actions to help preserve the long-term viability of the population. Simulations based on the population size and habitat area {{at the beginning of a}} companion study resulted in an effective population size that was generally above the threshold level for risk of loss of genetic variability, except when fishing mortality was increased. Simulations based on the reduced habitat area after the beaver dam failure and our assumption of a proportional reduction in population size resulted in an effective population size that was generally below the threshold level for risk of loss of genetic variability. Our results identified two potential threats to the long-term viability of the Shoepack Lake muskellunge population, reduction in habitat area and exploitation. Increased exploitation can be prevented through traditional fishery management approaches such as the adoption of no-kill, <b>barbless</b> <b>hook,</b> and limited entry regulations. Maintenance of the greatest possible habitat area and prevention of future habitat area reductions will require maintenance of the outlet dam built by beavers. Our study should enhance the long-term viability of the Shoepack Lake muskellunge population and illustrates a useful approach for other unique populations...|$|R
5000|$|The {{vessel was}} built in 1961 by Ditmar-Donaldson in Costa Mesa as a {{personal}} fishing boat for Gilbert C. Van Camp III, the CEO of the Van Camp Seafood Company and makers of [...] "Chicken of the Sea" [...] tuna. As a fishing boat, the Vantuna was configured for albacore fishing. The vessel held two large, 2500 gal live bait tanks and a 15-ton refrigerated fish hold. Metal racks attached to the stern provided platforms for fishermen close to the water's surface. They used long fishing poles with stainless steel leaders and <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks.</b> When large schools of albacore were located, live bait thrown into the water caused the fish {{to go into a}} feeding frenzy where they would bite anything, including the <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> of the fishing poles. Fish that were hooked were quickly pulled onboard by the fisherman. The <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> would easily fall out of the fish's mouth, and then the fish was moved into the refrigerated hold. Although this was his personal fishing boat, Mr. Van Camp took the fish he caught to the factory where they were used by his company.|$|E
5000|$|Slate Run, {{a popular}} fishery, {{supports}} wild brook and brown trout. Fishing is allowed year-round, but anglers {{are limited to}} fly fishing with <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> and must return all caught trout to the stream.

50|$|Catch {{and release}} is a {{practice}} within recreational fishing {{intended as a}} technique of conservation. After capture, the fish are unhooked {{and returned to the}} water.

50|$|One study {{looking at}} brook trout found that <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> {{did not result}} in {{statistically}} significantly lower mortality rates than barbed hooks when fish were hooked in the mouth, but did elevate mortalities if fish were hooked deeper. The study also suggested bait fishing does not have a significantly higher mortality when utilized in an active style, rather than a passive manner that allows the fish to swallow the bait.|$|E
50|$|The taimen is {{becoming}} a more well-known game fish, particularly for fly fishermen. Catch-and-release with <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> is practiced in many areas to conserve dwindling populations of this species. Organizations such as the Taimen Conservation Fund are working to conserve the remaining populations. While the taimen is sometimes (often illegally) harvested commercially, its low price and slow growth and reproduction make it more valuable as a game fish.|$|E
50|$|Responding to a {{proposal}} from Washington Trout, Olympic National Park has announced an emergency change to fishing regulations on Lake Crescent. On May 24 (2002), Park Superintendent David Morris announced that Lake Crescent {{and all its}} tributaries will be open for catch and release angling only. The rule change prohibits the use of down riggers, and requires that anglers use only artificial lures with single <b>barbless</b> <b>hooks</b> {{and no more than}} two ounces of weight. The emergency rule took effect June 1, the day the lake opened for fishing.|$|E
50|$|A {{tributary}} in Geauga County of the Chagrin River,and the Rocky River and its tributaries, {{located in}} Medina County, are the host to populations of wild brook trout in Ohio.
