25|$|Sand dunes {{migrated}} <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{shore of}} the Sundance Sea, creating the 350foot (107m) thick cliff-forming Wingate Sandstone. This formation is composed of orange-colored cross bedded fossilized sand dunes made of fine-grained and well-rounded quartz sand. Wingate outcrops are found capping the Waterpocket Fold's western escarpment. Prominent examples are easy to see near the Visitor Center in the Fruita Cliffs and in The Castle.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Technics {{started making}} their SL-1200 {{turntable}}, {{which became the}} most popular turntable for DJs due to its high torque direct drive design. The SL-1200 had a rapid start and its durable direct drive enabled DJs to manipulate the platter, as with scratching techniques. Hip hop DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with turntablism techniques such as scratching and beat juggling rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by DJ Kool Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore, and Afrika Bambaataa, as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> platter. Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.|$|E
500|$|The first trailer for {{the game}} made its début at the Namco Bandai Global Gamer Day in Las Vegas in April 2012 and showed {{gameplay}} footage in 3D. In order to promote the new video game in 2013, a trailer was produced which featured William Shatner and {{a man in a}} Gorn suit playing it on a console. The idea had come from an idea by Brian Miller and Gene Augusto, who initially went <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> idea in an attempt to create something that would go viral. They joked about using the line [...] "not your father's Star Trek", and sought to recreate the fight between Shatner and the Gorn from the episode [...] "Arena".|$|E
500|$|Bakshi {{claimed he}} [...] "didn't start {{thinking}} about shooting the film totally in live action until I saw it really start to work so well. I learned lots of things about the process, like rippling. One scene, some figures were standing on a hill and a big gust of wind came up and the shadows moved <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clothes and it was unbelievable in animation. I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly." [...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars {{could be seen in}} the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 26, 2008, Sánchez {{announced}} to her readers {{that the recent}} problems accessing her blog {{appeared to be a}} deliberate action on the part of government censors to block access to her blog and the other blogs on the desdecuba.com website. [...] While debate swirled <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> web about whether the site was actually blocked, Sanchez stated that Generation Y could not be accessed in Cuba for the past several years. [...] The debate about whether this was a year-long plus “fluke” or some “glitch” in the software, seemed to be resolved about a year after the site became unavailable. Comments made by a Cuban State Security agent in an interview published on March 19, 2009, in the digital magazine Kaos en la Red, where “Agent Miguel” stated, “I know State Security officials who literally prophesied that blocking the blog Generation Y within the country would, in a short time, cause the launching of Madame Sánchez into the stardom of the manipulative media campaign against Cuba. Regardless of these prophesies, they did it and now they’re paying the price.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{opening scene}} in the subway was {{initially}} {{going to be on}} top of a building so that the episode would begin and end the same, but co-creator J.J. Abrams thought {{it would be better to}} start it underground and [...] "move up throughout the episode". The episode began the setup of Olivia's backstory by revealing the Cortexiphan drug trials, which would be an ongoing plot point in continuing episodes. All the shots were chosen carefully to put the viewer in Olivia's troubled frame of mind, and consequently the episode had many tight shots that were meant to give a [...] "sense of unease". The producers felt that shooting on the lab set was the [...] "hardest set to shoot at on the planet" [...] because it contained several levels that inhibited the crew's ability to move cameras around. As Goldsman had an aversion to shooting in hospitals, they used a church for the mental hospital scenes. When Olivia, Peter, and Walter are en route to the climax at the building, the shots of them in the SUV were just shots of them driving <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 59th Street Bridge.|$|E
2500|$|A {{dot matrix}} printer or impact matrix printer refers to a type of {{computer}} printer with a print head that runs <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like a typewriter. Unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. [...] Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.|$|E

2500|$|Cray {{addressed}} {{the problem of}} skew by ensuring that every signal path in his later computers was the same electrical length, so that values that were to be acted upon {{at a particular time}} were indeed all valid values. [...] When required, he would run the traces <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> circuit boards until the desired length was achieved, and he employed Maxwell's equations in design of the boards to ensure that any radio frequency effects which altered the signal velocity and hence the electrical path length were accounted for.|$|E

She has an innate purity that shrinks from coarse brutality, obscene jests, horrid oaths, the accompaniments of our election days; and her presence will not restrain men at such times, and women, instead of being the gainer by the contract will be a loser in self respect surely." [...] She and Phillip Bell, who supported women's suffrage, would argue <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> topic in the Elevator.|$|E

A group of thirty people, all possessing a visa of [...] "Jakub Goldberg", were bounced <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open sea for several weeks before finally being allowed to pass through Tsuruga.

50|$|Early pen plotters, e.g., the Calcomp 565 of 1959, {{worked by}} placing the paper over a roller that moved the paper <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> for X motion, while the pen moved <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> a track for Y motion.

2500|$|The game's {{mechanics}} reportedly came {{up by the}} 100 {{staff members}} working on the game. Ideas would be written on a post-it note, and afterward were evaluated. If the team liked the idea, they would implement it in-game {{to see if it}} works. Kenta Motokura, a director of the game stated [...] "We discussed and discarded a huge number of ideas during development - sometimes you just can't tell if an idea is good or bad by looking at it on the drawing board; when this happens, we try it out in-game. If we don't find the idea fun, it won't make it into the final product. There was a lot of <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> course designs due to this".|$|E
2500|$|... {{where the}} {{notation}} ρ {{is used to}} describe the distance of the path from the origin instead of R to emphasize that this distance is not fixed, but varies with time. The unit vector uρ travels with the particle and always points {{in the same direction as}} r(t). Unit vector uθ also travels with the particle and stays orthogonal to uρ. Thus, uρ and uθ form a local Cartesian coordinate system attached to the particle, and tied to the path traveled by the particle. By moving the unit vectors so their tails coincide, as seen in the circle at the left of the image above, it is seen that uρ and uθ form a right-angled pair with tips on the unit circle that trace <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> perimeter of this circle with the same angle θ(t) as r(t).|$|E
