25|$|Gleeson {{grew up in}} Warrnambool, Victoria as {{a member}} of a sports-mad family, with four older {{siblings}} who were all good in their chosen sports of football, basketball and swimming. As a child, Gleeson would sneak as close as he could to the Melbourne Tigers bench to get a <b>better</b> <b>look</b> at legendary coach Lindsay Gaze and his players during Warrnambool's annual Seaside Basketball tournament every Australia Day weekend. Gleeson was keen on basketball in his youth and w{{as a member of}} Warrnambool's under 14 team which finished third at the Australian championships. In 1985, he graduated from Warrnambool's Emmanuel College.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, R. G. Harrison, a {{professor}} of anatomy, used a portable x-ray machine to get a <b>better</b> <b>look</b> at the internal structures of the mummy to better determine age and cause of death of Tutankhamun. One of the most abnormal findings was the sternum (breastbone) and {{most parts of the}} frontal ribs were missing. Removing these bones {{was not part of the}} normal mummification process, which led Harrison to believe they might have been removed because they were badly damaged before his death. Harrison quickly discovered that Carter was not as careful as many of his personal notes had claimed. The mummy was not re-wrapped after 1926, which led to more deterioration due to the extremely hot external elements over the forty-two years. Also many of the limbs had been amputated in the body in order to remove some of the jewellery. Both hands were cut off, both legs were removed from the pelvis, and the head was severed from the body in order to get the mask off. Even more remarkable is the king's right ear and penis were missing, but photographs from Carter show they were both present during his examination. Harrison believed the slight curve in the spine and small bone fragments might have been the result of the embalming process. The lesion on the left jaw showed signs of healing occurred before his death and one of his legs had been broken, but it could not be determined if it happened naturally or as a result of the embalming or Carter's examination. The fact that skull fragments were discovered led many to assume the king was murdered by a blow to the head, but the x-ray could not support or discredit this theory.|$|E

When {{asked if she}} still wishes she had the same body she had at 20 she replied, [...] "No. I actually think I look better now because I feel so much better about myself now. And that's what's so exciting. As you get older, you get <b>better....</b> <b>Look</b> at all these incredible women, like Vanessa Redgrave, who are still so beautiful.

500|$|The {{site was}} first rediscovered by {{accident}} in 1898 when Archibald Hamilton was riding across Withypool Heath. His horse stumbled {{against one of}} the stones, and on further investigation he located other stones within the bracken. After the bracken on the heath was burned away, something that took place periodically to encourage new growth, Hamilton returned to get a <b>better</b> <b>look</b> at the circle. He contacted Colonel Bramble, the Vice President of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, who put him in touch with the archaeologist Harold St George Gray. Gray then accompanied Hamilton on a visit to the site in August 1905, at which point he made a survey of the ring.|$|E
500|$|On 29 April 1731, Needham {{was convicted}} of keeping a disorderly house, fined one shilling, and sentenced to stand twice in the pillory, and [...] "to find sureties for her good {{behaviour}} for 3 years". On 30 April she {{was taken to the}} pillory near Park Place to stand for the first time. Perhaps because of her connections, she was allowed to lie face {{down in front of the}} pillory and a number of guards were paid to protect her. Despite this she received such a pelting that it was thought likely she would die before her punishment was completed. The crowds that had gathered to see her pilloried were so large that one boy fell on an iron fencing rail while trying to get a <b>better</b> <b>look</b> and was killed.|$|E

500|$|During the 1940s Blyton {{became a}} {{prolific}} author, her success enhanced by her [...] "marketing, publicity and branding {{that was far}} ahead of its time". In 1940 Blyton published two books– Three Boys and a Circus and Children of Kidillin– under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock (middle name plus first married name), {{in addition to the}} eleven published under her own name that year. So popular were Pollock's books that one reviewer was prompted to observe that [...] "Enid Blyton had <b>better</b> <b>look</b> to her laurels". But Blyton's readers were not so easily deceived and many complained about the subterfuge to her and her publisher, with the result that all six books published under the name of Mary Pollock– two in 1940 and four in 1943– were reissued under Blyton's name. Later in 1940 Blyton published the first of her boarding school story books and the first novel in the Naughtiest Girl series, The Naughtiest Girl in the School, which followed the exploits of the mischievous schoolgirl Elizabeth Allen at the fictional Whyteleafe School. The first of her six novels in the St. Clare's series, The Twins at St. Clare's, appeared the following year, featuring the twin sisters Patricia and Isabel O'Sullivan.|$|E
500|$|For crowd scenes, CIS {{supplemented}} the live-action extras {{with digital}} pedestrians created using motion capture. House of Moves captured {{the movements of}} five men and four women during a two-day shoot supervised by Hancock. The motion capture performers were coached to make the [...] "small, formal and refined" [...] movements that Owens said reflected the general public's conduct at the time. CIS combined the motion data with the Massive software package to generate the interactions of the digital pedestrians. The use of Massive presented a challenge {{when it came to}} blending digital pedestrians with live-action extras who had to move from the foreground into the digital crowd. Massive worked well until this stage, when the effects team had to move the digital pedestrians to avoid taking the live-action extras out of the shot. To allow close-ups of individual Massive extras, the effects team focused on their faces and walking characteristics. Hancock explained, [...] "We {{wanted to be able to}} push Massive right up to the camera and see how well it held up. In a couple of shots the characters might be 40 feet away from the camera, about 1/5 screen height. The bigger the screen is, the bigger the character. He could be 10 feet tall, so everything, even his hair, <b>better</b> <b>look</b> good!" [...] Typically, a limited number of motion performances are captured and Massive is used to create further variety, such as in height and walking speed. Because the digital extras were required to be close to the foreground, and to integrate them properly with the live action extras, House of Moves captured twice as much motion data than CIS had used on any other project. CIS created nine distinct digital characters. To eliminate inaccuracies that develop when creating a digital extra of different proportions to the motion capture performer, CIS sent nine skeleton rigs to House of Moves before work began. This gave House of Moves time to properly adapt the rigs to its performers, resulting in motion capture data that required very little editing in Massive. CIS wrote shaders for their clothing; displacement maps in the air shader were linked with the motion capture to animate wrinkles in trousers and jackets.|$|E

2500|$|While on an {{airplane}} once, Dean saw an advertisement in a magazine for a liquor company featuring a beautiful woman standing in water in a provocative pose holding a drink {{similar to the way}} Playboy posed models. [...] This led to an idea that changed the way guitars were marketed. Dean created his own ads that caused a wave of controversy. [...] Guitar ads for Dean’s company were featuring bikini-clad models wearing guitars. [...] His early music magazine print ads and trade show marketing used female models from Playboy, and [...] it was this marketing that filled NAMM Show (National Association of Music Merchants) event aisles with merchants seeking to get a <b>better</b> <b>look</b> at the guitars (and models) that were quickly becoming the talk of the industry.

2500|$|Still Eisenhower faced {{criticism}} in the press for not controlling his own administration, as Cannon's speech only said the mission was [...] "under the aegis of" [...] the president, not [...] "directed by." [...] Press reports were creating {{a belief in the}} public that Eisenhower had lost control, which Eisenhower would not let stand. Knowing that he was jeopardizing the Paris Peace Summit, Eisenhower decided to reveal the aerial espionage program and his direct role in it, an unprecedented move for a U.S. President. His speech on 11 May revolved around four main points: the need for intelligence gathering activities; the nature of intelligence gathering activities; how intelligence activities should be viewed (as distasteful, but vital); and finally that Americans should not be distracted from the real problems of the day. Eisenhower closed passionately by reacting to the Soviet claim that the US acted provocatively and said: [...] "They had <b>better</b> <b>look</b> at their own [...] record." [...] As he finished, he told reporters he was still going to the Paris Peace Summit.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Hume wrote an {{extremely}} brief autobiographical essay titled [...] "My Own Life" [...] which summed up his entire life in [...] "fewer than 5 pages", and notably contains many interesting judgments that have been of enduring interest to subsequent readers of Hume. The scholar of 18th century literature Donald Seibert judged it a [...] "remarkable autobiography, even though it may lack the usual attractions of that genre. Anyone hankering for startling revelations or amusing anecdotes had <b>better</b> <b>look</b> elsewhere." [...] Hume here confesses his belief that the"love of literary fame" [...] had served as his [...] "ruling passion" [...] in life, and claims that this desire [...] "never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments." [...] One such disappointment Hume discusses in the mini-autobiography was his disappointment that [...] with the initial literary reception of the Treatise, which he claims to have overcome by means of the success of the Essays: [...] "the work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment". Perhaps most notable is Hume's revelation of his own retrospective judgment that his philosophical debut's apparent failure [...] "had proceeded more from the manner than the matter." [...] Hume thus suggests that [...] "I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early." [...] Hume provides an unambiguous self-assessment of the relative value of his works: [...] "my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best." [...] Hume also makes a number of self-assessments in the essay, writing of his social relations that [...] "My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary", noting of his complex relation to religion, as well as the state, that [...] "though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury", and professing of his character that [...] "My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct." [...] Hume concludes the essay with the frank admission: [...] " [...] I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained." ...|$|E
