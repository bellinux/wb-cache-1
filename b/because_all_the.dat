5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{members were}} working their band {{schedule}} round their jobs {{they had to}} practice in basic recording rooms and write and record their own ideas. From this the members listened to each other's ideas and gave their interpretations and evaluations. Synthesiser player James felt the band produced their best work with this method as they were constantly assessing themselves.|$|E
5|$|Female California spiny {{lobsters}} reach sexual maturity at {{a length of}} , which is typically at an age of 5–9 years; males are sexually mature after 3–6 years. <b>Because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> hard parts are lost at each molt, {{the life span of}} mature {{spiny lobsters}} is uncertain; they are thought to live for 50 years or more.|$|E
5|$|During its 2002 annual session, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) added 14 {{amendments}} to the Constitution of Indonesia. Included in these amendments were measures to reorganize the legislature. Beginning in 2004, the MPR was composed of the existing People's Representative Council (DPR) and a new Regional Representative Council (DPD). <b>Because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> seats in the MPR were directly elected, this called for removal of the military from the legislature, whose 38 seats in the Assembly were appointed. This change and an amendment for direct election of the President and Vice President were major steps for Indonesia on the road towards a full democracy.|$|E

5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E
5|$|The {{first goal}} of the new stadium was scored by Rivellino {{shooting}} a penalty kick suffered by Palhinha. Rivellino shot at his own goal <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> players on the pitch insisted that the first goal at the Arena was his. The kick went past Ronaldo. The first competitive game was a 2014 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A match between Corinthians and Figueirense on 18 May 2014. The first international match was the opening match for the FIFA World Cup 2014 between Brazil and Croatia on 12 June 2014.|$|E
5|$|The work {{commenced}} {{at the end}} of {{the building}} furthest from the altar, with the latest of the narrative scenes, and progressed towards the altar with the scenes of the Creation. The first three scenes, from the story of Noah, contain a much larger number of small figures than the later panels. This is partly because of the subject matter, which deals with the fate of Humanity, but also <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> figures at that end of the ceiling, including the prophets and Ignudi, are smaller than in the central section. As the scale got larger, Michelangelo's style became broader, the final narrative scene of God in the act of Creation was painted in a single day.|$|E

5|$|By 2004, Braathens {{had managed}} to cut costs {{sufficiently}} to make a profit. At the same time, SAS was having problems making a profit. SAS announced on 10 March 2004 that SAS and Braathens would be merged into a single company, SAS Braathens, in May. At the same time, the airline would create separate national airlines for Sweden and Denmark. SAS Braathens would operate 50 aircraft, all variations of the 737. The company took over the operating licence of Braathens, including the IATA and ICAO code, and callsign. <b>Because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> operations streamlined and coordinated, {{there would be no}} further downstaffing due to the merger. From 1 June 2007, SAS Braathens was rebranded to Scandinavian Airlines, making it identical to the branding in Sweden and Denmark, although it remain a separate limited company named SAS Norge AS.|$|E
5|$|The near-absence {{of genetic}} {{recombination}} in mitochondrial DNA {{makes it a}} useful source of information for scientists involved in population genetics and evolutionary biology. <b>Because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> mitochondrial DNA is inherited as a single unit, or haplotype, the relationships between mitochondrial DNA from different individuals can be represented as a gene tree. Patterns in these gene trees {{can be used to}} infer the evolutionary history of populations. The classic example of this is in human evolutionary genetics, where the molecular clock can be used to provide a recent date for mitochondrial Eve. This is often interpreted as strong support for a recent modern human expansion out of Africa. Another human example is the sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from Neanderthal bones. The relatively large evolutionary distance between the mitochondrial DNA sequences of Neanderthals and living humans has been interpreted as evidence for the lack of interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.|$|E
25|$|Injection of {{seawater}} {{into the}} primary containment vessel (PCV) was discontinued at 01:10 on 14 March <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{water in the}} reserve pool had been used up. Supplies were restored by 03:20 and injection of water resumed.|$|E

25|$|The 2010 P {{songs were}} three in number, {{due to the}} fact that the arrival of the Parliament deputies {{happened}} before the parade, and were unique <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> songs sung were in English (one song even had lyrics in the 3 other major languages).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} {{period of the}} Tang dynasty, <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{emperors}} were her direct descendants, the evaluation for Wu Zetian were relatively positive. Commentary in subsequent periods, however, especially the book Zizhi Tongjian compiled by Sima Guang, criticized Wu Zetian harshly. By the period of Southern Song dynasty, when Neo-Confucianism was firmly established as the mainstream political ideology of China, their ideology determined the evaluation for Wu Zetian.|$|E
25|$|In this typical context, {{external}} forces and reactions to those forces {{are considered to}} act only at the nodes and result in forces in the members that are either tensile or compressive. For straight members, moments (torques) are explicitly excluded because, and only <b>because,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> joints in a truss are treated as revolutes, as {{is necessary for the}} links to be two-force members.|$|E

25|$|A faradaic pseudocapacitance only occurs {{together}} with a static double-layer capacitance, and its magnitude may exceed the value of double-layer capacitance for the same surface area by factor 100, depending on the nature {{and the structure of}} the electrode <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> pseudocapacitance reactions take place only with de-solvated ions, which are much smaller than solvated ion with their solvating shell. The amount of pseudocapacitance has a linear function within narrow limits determined by the potential-dependent degree of surface coverage of the adsorbed anions.|$|E
25|$|The San Patricio {{men were}} deserters in action, and had traitorously joined the enemy army. There was no {{question}} about this, and the punishment for desertion and treason was death. Scott's army was still facing a dangerous enemy and possible insurgency, so he placed the prisoners before courts martial to have them settle it. Eisenhower says the men were tried in two groups. The trials were conducted fairly by Brevet Colonel John Garland and by Colonel Bennet Riley. <b>Because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> men captured were wearing Mexican uniforms, they were found guilty and sentenced to hang.|$|E
25|$|The {{plugs and sockets}} used {{to power}} {{electric}} stoves from a single-phase line have to be rated for greater current values than ones for three-phase system <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> power has to be transferred through a single line. Electric stoves are often hardwired to the electrical supply system, connected to the mains with an appropriate high power industrial connector or with non-standard high power proprietary domestic connector (as some countries do not have wiring regulations for single-phase electric stoves). In Russia an electric stove can often be seen connected with a 25 to 32A connector.|$|E

25|$|Spoon bits are the {{traditional}} boring tools {{used with a}} brace. They should never be used with a power drill of any kind. Their key advantage over regular brace bits and power drill bits is that {{the angle of the}} hole can be adjusted. This is very important in chairmaking, <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> angles are usually eyeballed. Another advantage is {{that they do not have}} a lead screw, so they can be drilled successfully in a chair leg without having the lead screw peek out the other side.|$|E
25|$|The action dispossessed the Mohawks {{of their}} homes. Local white settlers, {{homeless}} after Iroquois raids, asked Gansevoort {{to turn the}} homes over to them. Both actions were criticized by Philip Schuyler, then a New York representative to the Continental Congress, <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Mohawks of Lower Mohawk castle had rejected fighting with the British, and many supported the Patriot cause. Ironically, Schuyler had been Washington's personal preference for command of the expedition, but his relief of command of the Continental Army's Northern Department had led to private service with the army until he could resign his commission, which he did in April 1779.|$|E
25|$|The mass {{kidnapping}} of the Cázares family stands out from other abduction cases in Mexico <b>because</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> eighteen victims were related. Among them were three U.S. citizens. The family has sent letters to {{officials in the}} lowest and {{highest levels of the}} Mexican government and has reached out to international heads of state for assistance on the case. The kidnapping is currently unsolved; the whereabouts of the five remaining abductees and the motives behind the kidnapping are officially unknown. Federal sources, however, agree that the kidnapping was masterminded by the top echelons of the Gulf Cartel.|$|E
