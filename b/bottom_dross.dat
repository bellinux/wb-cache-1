40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} water {{modeling}} studies of fluid flow and intermetallic dross particle behaviour in molten 55 %A 1 -Zn metal coating bath are presented. BLUESCOPE STEEL operates a number of metal coating lines with each having its own unique <b>bottom</b> <b>dross</b> behaviour. In some coating lines there is excessive <b>bottom</b> <b>dross</b> build-up, and to understand why this might occur two 113 scale experimental models were constructed one corresponding to a pot with an excessive <b>bottom</b> <b>dross</b> build-up problem and one without. Experiments were carried out to determine suspension characteristics, namely solids concentration as a hnction of time and particle deposition profiles, for different values of: water flow rates (kinetic power) through the inductors, bath geometry and coating speeds. The effect of the moving strip on suspended dross particles is discussed. Dross particle suspension in the coating bath was quantified by sampling the bath at various locations and using a particle analyser capable of counting and size distribution. It was found that for both inductor types (conventional and Jetflow) the kinetic power input due to the inductor jets had the greatest influence on suspension characteristics. The use of water modeling {{as a tool for}} problem solving, improved pot design and for developing operating practices to minimize <b>bottom</b> <b>dross</b> build-up is also discussed...|$|E
