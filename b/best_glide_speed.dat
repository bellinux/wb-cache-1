50|$|The {{effect of}} wind, lift and sink on <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> <b>speed</b> {{is to move}} the curve within the plot {{by the amount of}} each component. That is, if flying into a headwind, with no {{vertical}} air movement, the curve would move left toward the origin by an amount equal to the velocity of the wind. The effect is the tangent line for <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> <b>speed</b> moves further down the graph for an increasing <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> <b>speed</b> but a lower best glide ratio. Thus, when flying into a head wind, the <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> <b>speed</b> is higher but the best glide ratio is lower. Conversely, for a tail wind, the polar curve moves away from the origin so that <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> <b>speed</b> is lower and the effective glide ratio is improved. In lift, move the curve up for a lower <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> <b>speed</b> and better glide ratio. In sink, move the curve down for a higher <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> <b>speed</b> and a worse glide ratio. The effect is that when flying between thermals, you would slow down in rising air and speed up when encountering sink. Wind with lift/sink would simply move the plot the according amount for each component.|$|E

50|$|The <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> {{distance}} with engines windmilling is obtained {{with a clean}} airplane configuration and with a <b>glide</b> <b>speed</b> of 160 to 170 knots. At this speed, the Learjet 25 glides approximately 26 nautical miles for each 10000 feet of altitude loss.

50|$|For the {{aircraft}} with low Reynolds numbers (i.e. where minimizing turbulence and drag {{is a major}} concern) such as gliders, the small increase in drag from the turbulator at higher speeds is minor compared with the larger improvements at <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> <b>speed,</b> at which the glider can fly the farthest for a given height.|$|E
50|$|Common {{first steps}} after an EFTO {{would be to}} fly at the <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> <b>speed</b> (VBG), retract flaps if {{airspeed}} permits, unlatch the door, and land straight ahead. Returning to the airport with a steep turn has a high probability of resulting in a stall or spin. Although it seems counter intuitive, the NTSB has recorded numerous fatal crashes due to this mistake.|$|E
50|$|The HP-20 is {{all-metal}} with foam wing ribs. The design {{shares a}} similar fuselage to the HP-19, {{but has a}} different double-tapered wing of smaller area, 102 sq ft versus 113 sq ft for the HP-19. This gives the HP-20 a higher wing loading and higher <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> <b>speed,</b> although the glide ratio {{is the same as}} the HP-19 at 42:1. The airfoil is a Schreder modification of a Wortmann section, designated as Schreder 3. 200 lb of water ballast can be carried. The landing gear is a retractable monowheel.|$|E
5000|$|The origin for a polar {{curve is}} where the {{air-speed}} is zero and the sink rate is zero. In the first diagram a line has been drawn from the origin to the point with minimum sink. The slope of the line from the origin gives the glide angle, {{because it is the}} ratio of the distance along the airspeed axis to the distance along the sink rate axis. [...] A whole series of lines could be drawn from the origin to each of the data points, each line showing the glide angle for that <b>speed.</b> However the <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> angle is the line with the least slope. In the second diagram, the line has been drawn from the origin to the point representing the <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> ratio. The air-speed and sink rate at the <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> ratio can be read off the graph. Note that the <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> ratio is shallower than the glide ratio for minimum sink. All the other lines from the origin to the various data points would be steeper than the line of the <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> angle. Consequently, the line for the <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> angle will only just graze the polar curve, i.e. it is a tangent.|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores how onboard {{instrumentation}} {{can be used}} {{to study}} how birds interact with the atmosphere, in particular to understand their soaring strategies and gust response mechanisms. The instrumentation unit consists of integrated sensors, including a GPS, IMU (inertial measurement unit) and pressure transducer, which provide accurate, high frequency measurements of the aerodynamics and kinematics of a free flying bird. The equipment development and derivation of parameters are initially presented. The data recorded from multiple flights of a steppe eagle (Aquila nipalensis) are then used to analyse the different aspects of its soaring flight {{throughout the rest of the}} thesis. First, the occurrence and mechanism of the wing tuck manoeuvre is investigated and found to be a gust response, precipitated by a drop in aerodynamic loading. It is suggested that this reduction in loading results in a moment imbalance on the wings, and that ultimately the wings are pulled down by an internal musculoskeletal moment. The bird's slope soaring behaviour is then studied by using CFD analysis to model the local updrafts for comparison with the bird's performance. The analysis shows that the bird predominantly flew in the regions of strongest updraft along the ridge but did not attempt to maximise gravitational potential energy. This leads to gliding flight and a review of the theoretical derivation of the classic glide polar. A sensitivity analysis of the polar to different drag coeffcients highlights the need for more research into the selection of suitable values. The development of a new 'soaring optimisation' chart to include the effect of wind conditions on the selection of <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> <b>speed</b> is presented. This is then compared with experimental glide data from the bird and used to determine the optimal drag coeffcients for the polar model. Finally, a technique is developed for automatically identifying sections of thermalling flight and for removing the wind drift component to allow us to test thermalling behaviour. This exploratory analysis highlights the complexity of the flow structure within the thermal and the distinctly unsteady circling of the bird. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{information}} architecture of general aviation cockpits is shifting {{from one of}} independent mechanical instruments to one of digital sensors, common databuses, and liquid crystal displays. This integrated architecture presents an opportunity to improve general aviation safety through enhancements to the flight display utilizing the data, computing power, and display capabilities available on a modem integrated cockpit. A study of general aviation accident causes identified takeoff and climbout, stall, and spatial disorientation as potential root causes that could be addressed with enhancements to the Primary Flight Display of an integrated general aviation cockpit. To address these accident causes, four prototype enhancements were designed, implemented on a PFD, and flight tested in a single-engine general aviation aircraft. A Takeoff Performance Monitor prototype demonstrated the usefulness of automating the published takeoff distance calculation required of, but seldom performed by, pilots and also showed that performance deficiencies {{as small as a}} 10 % reduction in power can be detected within the first few seconds immediately after throttle-up. The prototype was also able to predict takeoff distance in real-time within 200 feet by 55 knots using a simple acceleration model. A Dynamic Stall and V-Speeds prototype calculated stall speeds, best angle of climb speed, best rate of climb speed, and <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> <b>speed</b> given the current flight conditions and marked them on the airspeed indicator. Subject pilots reported the speeds aided in maintaining awareness of stall margin and optimal performance conditions. (cont.) An Angle of Attack Estimator that used a speed-based method and an angle-based method to compute the angle of attack using only the data available on the PFD without additional sensors was prototyped along with two means of display; a traditional angle of attack gauge and a Pitch Limit Indicator. Both estimator methods were compared to an angle of attack vane during a series of maneuvers. It was shown that a speed-based angle of attack estimator along with the pitch limit indicator is a useful stall avoidance aid. Finally, an Unusual Attitude Alerting prototype provided specific verbal cues over the intercom when pitch or roll limits were exceeded to aid a pilot in recovery from unusual attitudes. Subject pilots preferred alerts that commanded the recovery maneuver over alerts that informed the pilot of the attitude but left the recovery procedure to the pilot, and preferred both to alerts that simply told the pilot to recover without specific information about the attitude. by Daniel R.

50|$|Although the <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> {{ratio is}} {{important}} when measuring {{the performance of}} a gliding aircraft, its glide ratio at a range of speeds also determines its success (see article on gliding).|$|R
50|$|Knowing {{the best}} speed to fly is {{important}} in exploiting {{the performance of a}} glider. Two of the key measures of a glider’s performance are its minimum sink rate and its <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> ratio, also known as the best 'glide angle'. These occur at different speeds. Knowing these speeds is important for efficient cross-country flying. In still air the polar curve shows that flying at the minimum sink speed enables the pilot to stay airborne {{for as long as possible}} and to climb as quickly as possible, but at this speed the glider will not travel as far as if it flew at the <b>speed</b> for the <b>best</b> <b>glide.</b> When in sinking air, the polar curve shows that best speed to fly depends on the rate that the air is descending. Using Paul MacCready's theory, the optimal speed to fly for best cross country speed may often be considerably in excess of the <b>speed</b> for the <b>best</b> <b>glide</b> angle to get out of the sinking air as quickly as possible.|$|R
