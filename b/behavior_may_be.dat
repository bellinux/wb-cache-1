5|$|Domestic cats, {{especially}} young kittens, {{are known for}} their love of play. This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey. Cats also engage in play fighting, {{with each other and with}} humans. This <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals.|$|E
5|$|Female {{homosexual}} <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{present in}} every culture, although {{the concept of}} a lesbian as a woman who pairs exclusively with other women is not. Attitudes about female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women's roles in each society, and each culture's definition of sex. Women in the Middle East have been historically segregated from men. In the 7th and 8th centuries, some extraordinary women dressed in male attire when gender roles were less strict, but the sexual roles that accompanied European women were not associated with Islamic women. The Caliphal court in Baghdad featured women who dressed as men, including false facial hair, but they competed with other women for the attentions of men.|$|E
5|$|The Javan rhino is {{much less}} vocal than the Sumatran; very few Javan rhino vocalizations have ever been recorded. Adults have no known predators other than humans. The species, {{particularly}} in Vietnam, is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near. Though a valuable trait from a survival standpoint, it has made the rhinos difficult to study. Nevertheless, when humans approach too closely, the Javan rhino becomes aggressive and will attack, stabbing with the incisors of its lower jaw while thrusting upward with its head. Its comparatively antisocial <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a recent adaptation to population stresses; historical evidence suggests they, like other rhinos, were once more gregarious.|$|E
50|$|Homophobic {{attitudes and}} <b>behaviors</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> linked to sexophobia: doctor Martin Kantor {{describes}} many homophobes as being basically sexophobes, who fear and loathe sexual relationships both between partners {{of the same}} sex and between heterosexual partners.|$|R

5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians {{to refer to a}} broader set of children whose <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E
25|$|The {{fields of}} {{sociobiology}} and evolutionary psychology {{attempt to explain}} animal and human behavior and social structures, largely in terms of evolutionarily stable strategies.

25|$|In this book, Eysenck {{suggests}} that political <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> analysed {{in terms of}} two independent dimensions: the traditional left-right distinction, and how 'tenderminded' or 'toughminded' a person is. Eysenck {{suggests that}} {{the latter is a}} result of a person's introversion or extraversion respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Reports {{of attitudes}} and <b>behaviors</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> subject to social {{desirability}} bias. Even {{in cases where}} respondents <b>are</b> anonymous, people <b>may</b> <b>be</b> less likely to acknowledge behaviors that they see as undesirable. Conversely they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{more likely to report}} behaviors that are seen as more desirable. Social desirability bias results from inconsistency between attitudes and behaviors. This is because although people may have positive attitudes toward behaviors they see as desirable, they do not actually perform the behaviors as often as they say they do. Studies making claims about behaviors based on reports when <b>behaviors</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> seen as desirable <b>may</b> <b>be</b> particularly sensitive to the attitudinal fallacy. Although indirect questioning has been a common practice among survey researchers, it is not generally effective at mitigating social desirability bias.|$|R

25|$|The {{hallmark}} {{symptom of}} OSA syndrome in adults is excessive daytime sleepiness. Typically, an adult or adolescent with severe long-standing OSA will fall asleep for very brief periods {{in the course}} of usual daytime activities if given any opportunity to sit or rest. This <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> quite dramatic, sometimes occurring during conversations with others at social gatherings.|$|E
25|$|A large {{molecule}} with an ionized {{group is}} technically an ion, but its <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> largely {{the result of}} non-ionic interactions. For example, sodium stearate (the main constituent of traditional soaps) consists entirely of ions, yet it is a soft material quite unlike a typical ionic solid. There is a continuum between ionic solids and molecular solids with little ionic character in their bonding.|$|E
25|$|Anti-social {{behavior}} {{is often seen}} as public behavior that lacks judgement and consideration for others and may damage them or their property. It may be intentional, as with vandalism or graffiti, or the result of negligence. Persistent anti-social <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a manifestation of an antisocial personality disorder. The counterpart of anti-social {{behavior is}} pro-social behavior, namely any behavior intended to help or benefit another person, group or society.|$|E

50|$|Threatening <b>behaviors</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{conceptualized}} as a maladaptive outgrowth of normal competitive urge for interrelational dominance generally seen in animals.

25|$|Chronic encephalomyelitis, {{which may}} be progressive, can involve {{cognitive}} impairment, brain fog, migraines, balance issues, weakness in the legs, awkward gait, facial palsy, bladder problems, vertigo, and back pain. In rare cases, untreated Lyme disease may cause frank psychosis, which has been misdiagnosed as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Panic attacks and anxiety can occur; also, delusional <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> seen, including somatoform delusions, sometimes accompanied by a depersonalization or derealization syndrome, where the patients begin to feel detached from themselves or from reality.|$|E
25|$|People with DLB may swing {{dramatically}} {{between good}} days, with high alertness and few cognitive or movement problems, and bad days, {{and the level}} of care they require thus may vary widely and unpredictably. Sharp changes in <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> due to the day-to-day variability of DLB, but they also may be triggered by changes in the schedule or home environment, or by physical problems, such as constipation, dehydration, bladder infection, injuries from falls, and other problems {{they may not be able}} to convey to caregivers. Potential physical problems always should be taken into consideration when an individual with DLB becomes agitated.|$|E
25|$|In human studies, testosterone-aggression {{research}} has also focused {{on the role of}} the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). This brain area is strongly associated with impulse control and self-regulation systems that integrate emotion, motivation, and cognition to guide context-appropriate behavior. Patients with localized lesions to the OFC engage in heightened reactive aggression. Aggressive <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> regulated by testosterone via reduced medial OFC engagement following social provocation. When measuring participants' salivary testosterone, higher levels can predict subsequent aggressive behavioral reactions to unfairness faced during a task. Moreover, brain scanning with fMRI shows reduced activity in the medial OFC during such reactions. Such findings may suggest that a specific brain region, the OFC, is a key factor in understanding reactive aggression.|$|E

25|$|Although females often {{instigate}} sexual cannibalism, reversed sexual cannibalism {{has been}} observed in Micaria sociabilis and Allocosa brasiliensis. In a laboratory experiment on M. sociabilis, males preferred to eat older females. This <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> interpreted as adaptive foraging, because older females have low reproductive potential and food may be limited. Reversed cannibalism in M. sociabilis may also be influenced by size dimorphism. Males and females are similar sizes, and bigger males {{were more likely to}} be cannibalistic. In A. brasiliensis males tend to be cannibalistic in between mating seasons, after they have mated, gone out of their burrows to search for food, and left their mates in their burrows. Any females they cross during this period likely have little reproductive value, so this may also be interpreted as adaptive foraging.|$|E
25|$|Some spiders, such as Pholcus phalangioides, will prey {{on their}} own kind when food is scarce. Also, females of Phidippus johnsoni have been {{observed}} carrying dead males in their fangs. This <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> triggered by aggression, where females carry over hostility from their juvenile state and consume males just as they would prey. Sih and Johnson surmise that non-reproductive cannibalism can occur due to a remnant of an aggression trait in juvenile females. Known as the “aggressive spillover hypothesis,” this tendency unselectively to attack anything that moves is cultivated by {{a positive correlation between}} hostility, foraging capability, and fecundity. Aggression at a young age leads to an increase in prey consumption and as such, a larger adult size. This behavior “spills over” into adulthood, and shows up as a nonadaptive trait that manifests itself through adult females preying on males of their same species.|$|E
25|$|Apparent {{correlation}} between heredity and <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> due to social stereotypes making people with certain physical characteristics (which may be hereditary physical characteristics) behave in certain ways, without any biological {{link between the}} genetic factor and the behavior. This violatates the equal environment assumption of twin design and suggests a stronger argument for environmental influences. This factor has an especially high likelihood of being the case for behaviors that are culturally depicted in mass media as being more accepted by those who consider them to be biological than by those who consider them learned (e.g. sexuality and some psychiatric diagnoses) and for physical characteristics that are not culturally considered by mass media to be bigoted to associate with certain behaviors (e.g. not ethnic or racial). Such unequal environment biases may concentrate on {{a relatively small number}} of minor physical characteristics that are subject to stereotypes that are considered to be politically correct, with no statistically significant effect on overall ratings of physical similarity, let alone anywhere near being able to pass identical twins off as being fraternal.|$|E
50|$|It can be {{difficult}} to draw the line between normal and abnormal behaviors. In general, abnormal behaviors must be maladaptive and cause an individual significant discomfort in order to be of clinical and research interest. According to the DSM-IV-TR, <b>behaviors</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> considered abnormal if they are associated with disability, personal distress, the violation of social norms, or dysfunction.|$|R
50|$|Predictability {{can also}} be {{influenced}} depending on what is being measured, and some <b>behaviors</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more consistent than others. For example, the amount a person gestures or the volume of a person's voice {{are more likely to}} be consistent across situations than goal-directed behaviors, such as when a person is trying to impress another person.|$|R

500|$|Except {{for mothers}} with young and {{occasional}} observations of pairs of males, animals are usually found alone, {{so that the}} species is considered solitary.

500|$|In the wild, M. campanulae seal {{off their}} cells within the nest with natural resins found in plants and trees. In 2013, however, {{researchers}} {{reported that the}} bees had used synthetics, including caulk, to seal the cells. [...] Compositional analysis of these materials revealed calcium, titanium, and iron. [...] They resembled polyurethane-based sealants typically used in building construction. [...] It {{is not uncommon for}} insects to live inside found objects made of plastic. [...] However, these findings are the first known of insects actually building nests with plastic. [...] With help from citizen scientists in Toronto, over 200 nest boxes were placed throughout the city. [...] Scanning electron microscopy, x-ray microanalysis, and infrared microscopy were employed in identification of polymeric specimens. [...] Researchers suggest the bees' <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> an example of adaptive behavior. Since some of the bees were free of parasites, these novel and possibly more robust methods of nest building may offer additional protection. [...] Incorporation of plastic into the walls and sealants of the cell nests appeared to provide some protection against brood parasite invasion. [...] However, use of these more readily available synthetic materials, in an urban setting, may be incidental. [...] In fact, exposure of brood to polyurethane and polyethylene based plastics could be detrimental, as the Canadian team noted, since diffusion of moisture could be inhibited. [...] Some of the brood specimens were heavily affected by mold growth. [...] Additionally, synthetic materials in the nest might hinder the bees ability to move and breath. [...] Toxin exposures and other effects of urbanization are well documented contributors towards pollinator decline in general.|$|E
