This was when the SECR and Woolwich <b>batches</b> began to receive new domes and front footsteps during overhauls and general repairs. These were the same design as those used on Nos.14001414, and were intended to standardise components between the <b>batches.</b> The SECR and Woolwich <b>batches</b> also received smoke deflectors to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring the driver's vision ahead. The U1 chimneys replaced the standard Nclass type on the earlier locomotives, which, along with the removal of the piston tail rods on the earlier <b>batches,</b> created a truly standardised appearance.|$|E

30|$|This {{research}} has presented {{an effort to}} optimize scheduling with objective of minimizing lateness and penalty costs in an FMS. To fulfill on time delivery of orders, the suitable <b>batch</b> size strategy selection and execution is significant as <b>batch</b> size directly affects completion time. Different <b>batch</b> sizes yield different completion time and sequence-dependent setup times. Multi-objective Pareto optimization using GA is performed to investigate and compare the results of three <b>batch</b> size strategies: (1) constant <b>batch</b> size of 5 and 10. (2) MPS strategy (3) variable <b>batch</b> size. In first scenario, the <b>batch</b> size of each part is kept 5 and then 10. The larger <b>batch</b> size shows better results. Then, MPS strategy is addressed and results show that setup times are too high for the minimum value of completion time. In the last scenario, variable <b>batch</b> size is used to optimize conflicting objectives. All possible <b>batch</b> sizes of each part are evaluated using the GA and five best results are discussed. The results show that variable <b>batch</b> size strategy exhibits superior results as compared to constant and MPS <b>batch</b> size strategies. This work significantly contributes to an FMS to opt suitable <b>batch</b> size strategy in various demand patterns.|$|R
