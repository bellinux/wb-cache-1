2500|$|When you {{get right}} down to it, Cain’s [...] plan is a 25 percent {{flat-rate}} consumption tax — not all that different from the FAIR tax that he says is his ultimate goal. This tax would be paid three times: first on wage income, again at the cash register as a sales tax, and yet again by businesses on their sales minus their cost of goods and services. For tax junkies, the first is a flat tax. The second is a retail sales tax and the third a <b>business</b> <b>transfer</b> tax. [...] But they are all consumption taxes.|$|E

40|$|Employment {{tax credit}} {{programs}} have been repeatedly used during economic crises, although their usefulness is empirically contestable. The objective {{of this paper is}} to quantify the tax effects of employment tax credit programs. A recent revision of the German inheritance tax law provides an eminent opportunity to analyze the effects caused by such a preferential treatment. The tax liability depends on a company’s future employment expenses. Hence, we use micro-level data of realized <b>business</b> <b>transfers</b> from the German Inheritance Tax Statistic and combine them with a simulation of the future development of employment over the relevant time-horizon. We identify the magnitude of tax reductions granted to <b>business</b> <b>transfers</b> under a preferential treatment. Further, we demonstrate that these reductions are considerably larger in times of economic growth. Our findings also suggest that employment tax credits have pro-cyclical effects and specifically foster transfers between unrelated parties. Finally, the preferential treatment of <b>business</b> <b>transfers</b> does not provide incentives to increase employment. ...|$|R
