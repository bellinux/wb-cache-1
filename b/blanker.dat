At {{the end of the}} 1970s, he moved to Casablanca Records, which was best known at the time for its successes with disco star Donna Summer and rock'n'roll band Kiss. His first success for the company in 1980 was the novelty song [...] "It's Hard To Be Humble", a light-hearted look at how {{popularity}} and good looks could go to one's head. The song became his first Country music top 10 and a rare top 30 hit in the UK. (It was translated into Dutch as [...] "Het is moeilijk bescheiden te blijven" [...] and became a hit for the Dutch singer Peter <b>Blanker</b> in 1981). Later that year, he also had another top 10 song with [...] "Let's Keep It That Way". In November, [...] "Rock'n'Roll (I Gave You The Best Years Of My Life)" [...] was played by KHJ in Los Angeles as its last song before it switched from Top 40 to Country music. He achieved other successful songs, such as [...] "Texas In My Rear View Mirror" [...] and [...] "Hooked on Music", which became his biggest Country music success in 1981, going to no.2. In 1985, he recorded his last top 10 country music success with the song [...] "I Never Made Love (Till I Made Love With You)".|$|E

Compared {{to the base}} metal, the formability of tailor-welded <b>blank</b> is less due {{to the presence of}} weld area and strength mismatch between component <b>blanks.</b> Most sheet metals used to produce tailor-welded <b>blanks</b> have anisotropy induced during pre-processing stage due to large deformation. The orientation of the <b>blank</b> sheet rolling direction and the combination of the <b>blank</b> sheet materials has significant influence on the deformation behaviour. The effect of anisotropy in the tailor-welded <b>blank</b> and the orientation of <b>blank</b> sheets rolling direction during deep-drawing process are investigated in this study. Finite element analysis of deep-drawing mild steel and dual-phase steel tailor-welded <b>blank</b> models was carried out using research purpose FE code DD 3 IMP; to form a basis for tailor-welded <b>blank</b> design and development for a part. Anisotropy in the <b>blank</b> sheets has moderate influence and its contribution to increased material flow depends on the mechanical properties of the <b>blank</b> sheets.

40|$|Abstract. Fine-blanking with {{negative}} clearance {{is a kind}} of fine <b>blanking</b> processes. The punch size of fine-blanking {{with negative}} clearance is larger than the die size. The paper does lots of simulations for the changes of <b>blanking</b> force in fine-blanking with negative clearance and common <b>blanking</b> by DEFORM software, and the <b>blanking</b> force curves are gained by these experiments. The changing principle of <b>blanking</b> force and internal material is obtained through the simulation and experiments. The result shows that simulation <b>blanking</b> force of AISI- 1045 is lager than the actual <b>blanking</b> force. According to the curves derived from experiments, we can see that the maximum <b>blanking</b> force of fine-blanking with negative clearance is higher than common <b>blanking</b> force. Compared with fine-blanking with negative clearance, the common <b>blanking</b> force reduces faster after the <b>blanking</b> force reaches maximum value. The experiment result shows that the force of fine-blanking with negative clearance under a smaller <b>blanking</b> clearance is a bit bigger than the force of common <b>blanking</b> force, and the <b>blanking</b> quality of fine-blanking with negative clearance is much better than that of common <b>blanking.</b> Cracks can be closed effectively by the special squeeze forming in fine <b>blanking</b> with negative clearance. Then, the crack can not expand continuously, and the bonding force is enhanced. The squeeze forming can restrain intergranular deformation and reduce the damage. However, the stretch forming easily leads to the inner crack and defect of materials. By means of the analysis on experimental curves, the paper further studies the changing law of fine-blanking with negative clearance <b>blanking</b> force...|$|R
40|$|<b>Blank</b> {{design is}} an {{important}} task in sheet metal forming process optimization. The initial <b>blank</b> shape has direct effect on the part quality. This paper presents a deformation based <b>blank</b> design approach to determine the initial <b>blank</b> shape for a formed part. The <b>blank</b> design approach is integrated separately into ABAQUS, and DD 3 IMP, a research purpose in-house FEA code, to demonstrate its compatibility with any FEA code. The algorithm uses FE results to optimize the <b>blank</b> shape for a part. Deep drawing simulation of a rectangular cup geometry was carried out with an initial <b>blank</b> shape determined empirically. The <b>blank</b> shape was iteratively modified, based on the deformation history, until an optimal <b>blank</b> shape for the part is achieved. The optimal <b>blank</b> shapes predicted by the algorithm using both FEA softwares were similar. Marginal differences in the shape error indicate that the deformation history based push/pull technique can effectively determine an optimal <b>blank</b> shape for a part with any FEA software. For the shape error selected, both procedures estimate the optimal <b>blank</b> shape for the part within five iterations. Peer reviewe...|$|R
