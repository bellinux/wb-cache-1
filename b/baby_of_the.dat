25|$|During {{the same}} segment of The Today Show, Couric interviewed Dr. Ronald Wapner, head of {{maternal}} fetal medicine at New York Presbyterian Hospital, He discussed possible {{pros and cons}} of the test. His first concern was whether the stated accuracy rate achieved in the 2,000 test cases would be realized in real world usage. His second concern was whether couples who purchase the test might use the results for family balancing, which means the decision to utilize selective abortion to achieve a <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desired sex. Wapner said that one positive aspect of the Baby Gender Mentor test is the non-invasive nature of the test, which means there should be no risk of harm to the fetus.|$|E
25|$|The National Public Radio investigative {{report on}} Acu-Gen {{predicted}} that parents {{may use the}} Baby Gender Mentor test {{as a basis for}} determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that women who want to have a specific sex will be learning the results {{at a time when it}} is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons are {{a family}} {{who live in a}} fictional [...] "Middle America" [...] town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety {{inspector}} at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another. The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in [...] "I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot". Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes.|$|E
40|$|Skinfold {{thickness}} {{measurements were}} made at biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac sites on both sides on 265 full-term newborn infants. The mothers were classified as thin (25), normal (179), or obese (61) on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> their triceps skinfold thicknesses. At all skinfold sites <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obese mothers were significantly fatter than <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> normal mothers, and <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normal mothers were significantly fatter than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thin mothers. There was a highly significant positive correlation between maternal triceps thickness and <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> sum <b>of</b> skinfold thicknesses.

Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights for his life's work, Groening decided to go in another direction, and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family. The <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family was named Maggie after Groening's youngest sister. Maggie then made her debut with the rest of the Simpsons family on April 19, 1987 in the short [...] "Good Night". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series that would air on the Fox Broadcasting Company. Maggie {{and the rest}} of the family remained the main characters on this new show.|$|E

The C10 was intended to be a city car, capable of carrying two passengers at up to [...] in a roofed but open-sided compartment with two wheels at the front and one at the back. Wood Rogers intended it to effectively be an updated version of the Isetta, a 1960s Italian microcar. Sinclair built a full-scale mock-up of it; according to Wood Rogers, [...] "it looked great. I specified open sides to keep the cost down and having no doors meant it escaped a lot of regulations too."

As patriarch, Ted consoled his extended family along with President Clinton at the public memorial service. He paraphrased William Butler Yeats by saying of his nephew: [...] "We dared to think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like his father, he had every gift but length of years." [...] Ted now served as a role model for Maria Shriver, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Joseph Patrick Kennedy II, and other family members. The Boston Globe wrote of the changed role: [...] "It underscored the evolution that surprised so many people who knew the Kennedys: Teddy, the <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family, who had grown into a man who could sometimes be dissolute and reckless, had become the steady, indispensable patriarch, the one the family turned to in good times and bad." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{attending}} UCLA, {{which did}} not have a public speaking team, Cartwright continued training as a voice actress with Butler. She recalled, [...] "every Sunday I'd take a 20-minute bus ride to his house in Beverly Hills for a one-hour lesson and be there for four hours... They had four sons, they didn't have a daughter and I kind of fitted in as the <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family." [...] Butler introduced her to many of the voice actors and directors at Hanna-Barbera. After she met the director Gordon Hunt, he asked her to audition for a recurring role as Gloria in Richie Rich. She received the part, and later worked with Hunt on several other projects. At the end of 1980, Cartwright signed with a talent agency and landed a lead role in a pilot for a sitcom called In Trouble. Cartwright described the show as [...] "forgettable, but it jump-started my on-camera career". She graduated from UCLA in 1981 with a degree in theater. During the summer, Cartwright worked with Jonathan Winters as part of an improvisation troupe at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio.|$|E

She then tried to stay away, however it became obvious he needed her when he struggled without her. Marilyn then became obsessed with Nicole having the power to take her new son back. It was then revealed that Nicole would struggle to switch off her mothering instinct after giving George away. Nicole came to visit the baby and Marilyn caught her breastfeeding George, while she was alone with him. Symons called the scenes [...] "volatile."

Based on the determined number, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> octants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parent octant are identified. A pre-calculated look up {{table is}} used for identifying the baby octant.

40|$|Fetal {{growth is}} an {{indicator}} of social inequalities in health that may have a long-term impact persisting into later life. Little is known about <b>the</b> social patterns <b>of</b> birth weight in Hong Kong. This is a study of live-born singletons from 1984 to 1997 in a Hong Kong birth registry. Ordinary least-squares regression and logistic regression are used to analyse birth weight and low birth weight (< 2500 g), respectively. A gradient of birth weight and prevalence of low birth weight is demonstrated according to mothers' educational attainment. In relation to <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most educated mothers, <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> least educated mothers had a mean deficit of 46 g in birth weight and an odds ratio of 1. 56 of low birth weight (each P< 0. 05). This social gradient was hidden unless parity was adjusted for. Unexpectedly, migrants from mainland China delivered heavier rather than lighter babies (each P< 0. 05). Type of living quarters and parental relation were also related to birth weight and low birth weight (each P< 0. 05).
