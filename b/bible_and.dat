5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} {{a greater degree of}} {{scholarship}} in The Woman's Bible, but was unable to convince Bible scholars of her day to take part in what was expected to be a controversial project.

In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's <b>Bible,</b> <b>and</b> subsequent works by Letty Russell and Phyllis Trible furthered the connection between feminism and the Bible.
