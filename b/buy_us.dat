5|$|The CIP was {{a scheme}} whereby US dollars {{were given to}} the South Vietnamese {{government}} treasury. Selected businesspeople were given import licenses that allowed them to purchase US dollars with South Vietnamese currency at a rate far below the market value. The importers then used their American currency to <b>buy</b> <b>US</b> goods, while the Saigon government kept the South Vietnamese currency paid by the businessmen to fund the military and public service. The objective of the mechanism was to inject large amounts of money into the economy in an indirect way, through material goods, so that inflation would be avoided. However, the initiative failed to generate much economic development, as licenseholders spent most of their funds on consumer goods.|$|E

Since 23 October 1995, the dinar has been officially pegged to the IMF's {{special drawing rights}} (SDRs). In practice, it is fixed at 1 US$ = 0.709 dinar, which translates to approximately 1 dinar = 1.41044 dollars.

25|$|Taiwan has {{requested}} {{to buy the}} F-35 from the US. However this has been rejected by the US in fear of a critical response from China.

However, in September 2011, {{during a visit to}} the US, the Deputy Minister of National Defense of Taiwan confirmed that while the country was busy upgrading its current F-16s it was still also looking to procure a next-generation aircraft such as the F-35. This received the usual critical response from China. Taiwan renewed its push for an F-35 purchase under the Presidency of Donald Trump in early 2017, again causing criticism from China.|$|E

25|$|Postwar world {{capitalism}} {{suffered from}} a huge dollar shortage. The United States was running huge balance of trade surpluses, and the U.S. reserves were immense and growing. It was necessary to reverse this flow. Even though all nations wanted to <b>buy</b> <b>US</b> exports, dollars {{had to leave the}} United States and become available for international use {{in order for them to}} do so. In other words, the United States would have to reverse the imbalances in global wealth by running a balance of trade deficit, financed by an outflow of US reserves to other nations (a US financial account deficit). The US could run a financial deficit by either importing from, building plants in, or donating to foreign nations. Recall that speculative investment was discouraged by the Bretton Woods agreement. Importing from other nations was not appealing in the 1950s, because US technology was cutting edge at the time. So multinationals and global aid which originated from the US burgeoned.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, the State of Florida {{agreed to}} <b>buy</b> <b>U.S.</b> Sugar {{and all of}} its {{manufacturing}} and production facilities for an estimated $1.7billion. Florida officials indicated they intended to allow U.S. Sugar to process for six more years before dismissing its employees and dismantling the plant. The area, which includes [...] of land, would then be rehabilitated and water flow from Lake Okeechobee would be restored. In November 2008, the agreement was revised to offer $1.34billion, allowing sugar mills in Clewiston to remain in production. Critics of the revised plan say that it ensures sugarcane will be grown in the Everglades for at least another decade. Further research is being done to address the continuing production of sugarcane in the Everglades to minimize phosphorus runoff.|$|E
500|$|Florida still {{receives}} a thousand new residents daily and lands slated for restoration and wetland recovery are often {{bought and sold}} before {{the state has a}} chance to bid on them. The competitive pricing of real estate also drives it beyond the purchasing ability of the state. Because the State of Florida is assisting with purchasing lands and funding construction, some of the programs under CERP are vulnerable to state budget cuts. In June 2008 Governor Crist announced that the State of Florida will <b>buy</b> <b>U.S.</b> Sugar for $1.7billion. The idea came when sugar lobbyists were trying to persuade Crist to relax restriction of U.S. Sugar's practice of pumping phosphorus-laden water into the Everglades. According to one of the lobbyists who characterized it as a [...] "duh moment", Crist said, [...] "If sugar is polluting the Everglades, and we're paying to clean the Everglades, why don't we just get rid of sugar?" [...] The largest producer of cane sugar in the U.S. will continue operations for six years, and when ownership transfers to Florida, [...] of the Everglades will remain undeveloped to allow it to be restored to its pre-drainage state.|$|E

2500|$|Gandhi {{inherited}} a weak and troubled economy. Fiscal {{problems associated with}} the war with Pakistan in 1965, along with a drought-induced food crisis that spawned famines, had plunged India into the sharpest recession since independence. The government responded by taking steps to liberalize the economy, and by agreeing to the devaluation of the currency in return for the restoration of foreign aid. The economy managed to recover in 1966 and ended up growing at 4.1% over 1966–1969. But, much of that growth was offset {{by the fact that the}} external aid promised by the United States government and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), meant to ease the short-run costs of adjustment to a liberalized economy, never materialized. American policy makers had complained of continued restrictions imposed on the economy. At the same time, Indo-US relations were straining due to Gandhi's criticism of the American bombing campaign in Vietnam. While it was thought, at the time, and for decades after, that President Johnson's policy of withholding food grain shipments was to coerce Indian support for the war, in fact, it was to offer India rainmaking technology that he wanted to use as a counterweight to China's possession of the atomic bomb. In light of the circumstances, liberalization became politically suspect and was soon abandoned. Grain diplomacy and currency devaluation became matters of intense national pride in India. After the bitter experience with Johnson, Gandhi decided not to request food aid in the future. Moreover, Gandhi's government resolved never again to become [...] "so vulnerably dependent" [...] on aid, and painstakingly began building up substantial foreign exchange reserves. When food stocks slumped after poor harvests in 1972, the government made it a point to use foreign exchange to <b>buy</b> <b>US</b> wheat commercially rather than seek resumption of food aid.|$|E
