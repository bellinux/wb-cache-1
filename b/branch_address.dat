The different proposed predictors take advantage of different observed patterns in branch behavior. This paper presents a method of combining the advantages of these different types of predictors.

When there is no branch instruction, both the queues together act as a single queue, referred to as an alternate mode of operation. Whenever a branch instruction {{is present in the}} current instruction mix, there is a switch over to the branch mode of operation in which the primary queue fetches from the address returned by the predictor while the auxiliary queue fetches from the other path until the <b>branch</b> <b>address</b> is resolved. Hence the next instruction (irrespective of whether the branch is taken or not) is always available. The idea has been implemented using simplescalar toolset 3. 0 and tested on SPECINT 2000 benchmarks, and a 25 - 55 % improvement in IPC has been observed.

Here we report on simulations {{of a variety of}} {{branch prediction}} schemes using a set of relatively large benchmark programs that we believe to be more representative of likely system workloads. We have examined the sensitivity of these prediction schemes to variation in workload, in resources, and in design and configuration. We show that for predictors with small available resources, aliasing between distinct branches can have the dominant influence on prediction accuracy. As a result, the simple scheme of selecting a predictor using the <b>branch</b> <b>address</b> can be more effective than more elaborate correlating branch predictors.
