5|$|On 17 February 1979, China retaliated against Vietnam's {{invasion}} of Kampuchea by attacking along the Sino-Vietnam border, and within ten days {{had reached the}} provincial capitals. Fighting bogged down due to the maze of tunnels the Chinese encountered; nevertheless, the Chinese army captured Cao <b>Bằng</b> <b>on</b> 2 March and Lạng Sơn on 4 March, reportedly advancing towards Hanoi at a high speed, though not on good terms with its supply lines. However, the following day, China {{announced that it would}} not move deeper into Vietnam, apparently after meeting fierce and unexpectedly harsh resistance by well trained and equipped Vietnamese forces, supplied with American technology left behind from the Vietnam War. Confident that the threat of invasion had been a success, the Chinese subsequently withdrew their forces. Although China failed to decisively win the 27-day conflict, the diversion of troops from Kampuchea facilitated a strong resurgence in Khmer Rouge insurgent operations, making it unavoidable for the young PRK regime in Kampuchea to implement conscription, and requiring Vietnam to station a large portion of its army along the Sino-Vietnamese border.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{copyright}} control of melodies {{was not as}} strict, and publishers would often print their own versions of the songs popular at the time. With stronger copyright protection laws late in the century, songwriters, composers, lyricists, and publishers started working together for their mutual financial benefit. Songwriters would literally <b>bang</b> <b>on</b> the doors of Tin Pan Alley businesses to get new material.|$|E

In contrast, Vivek Ramz from in.com rated it 3 out of 5 and said that it [...] "doesn't meet the huge expectations it had created for itself", calling it [...] "another regular commercial film which entertains in bits and pieces". Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff rated the film 2.5 out of 5, saying [...] "Vijay fans will find plenty to rejoice in this subdued avatar of their star, but audiences who seek intelligence in their movies will find it rather dull".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast, actor Dwayne Johnson made a brief live-action appearance in the episode, appearing as himself, along with two action figures of Peter and Lois, which he proceeds to <b>bang</b> <b>on</b> {{top of each other}} in order to illustrate a censored sex scene. Commenting on his appearance in the episode, Johnson stated that he was a [...] "big fan" [...] of Family Guy, having quickly befriended show creator Seth MacFarlane after he had a minor role in Johnson's 2010 film Tooth Fairy. While filming the movie, Johnson had reached out to MacFarlane, saying that he would love to [...] "return the favor" [...] by appearing on Family Guy, which eventually led to his role in this episode. Actress Adrianne Palicki and voice actor Rick Pasqualone also guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Alexandra Breckenridge and Ralph Garman, along with writers Steve Callaghan, Mark Hentemann, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin and John Viener, also made minor appearances.

500|$|The {{day after}} the contest, Vissi could be seen crying in front of cameras while recounting her {{experience}} and thanking the Greek public for all their love and support. She soon re-released Nylon as a dual disc with music videos, and also a remix of [...] "Everything" [...] by Valentino and Siganos. After Eurovision Vissi went on hiatus from the Greek music industry, performing a worldwide tour for the Greek diaspora in 2007 as well as recording English-language material for her planned international album in Los Angeles, California with her then-producer Greg Ladanyi. A court case also further postponed her Greek career. Since the second re-release of Nylon in autumn 2006, Vissi had not released any new material until October 29, 2008, when she released the song [...] "To Parelthon Mou" [...] (my past) as the lead soundtrack single for the Greek movie Bank <b>Bang.</b> <b>On</b> December 9, 2008 she released the album Apagorevmeno (2008) which was certified double platinum in Greece under the new 2009 thresholds, denoting shipments of 24 thousand copies, one of her lowest selling albums and lowest of the 2000s. It was certified triple platinum in her native Cyprus. Her first album in the 2010s, Agapi Einai Esi, performed worse than its predecessor, being certified gold for shipments of six thousand copies and falling off of the charts after two months, while her concert attendances generally did not meet expectations, despite heavy promotion.|$|E
500|$|EastEnders has {{received}} {{praise for the}} handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, {{it was reported that}} media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as [...] "more tragic" [...] or [...] "more sexy" [...] in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50. Source organisations working with EastEnders on the storyline have commented: [...] " [...] decided {{it was going to be}} [...] and very rightly so. <b>Bang</b> <b>on,</b> the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and how would she share it? Every female would have that problem. How would you tell your children? And they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person." [...] The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented [...] "particularly positive messages" [...] concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline [...] "didactic". The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.|$|E
