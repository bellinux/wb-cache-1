5|$|As {{discussed}} above, in the PostgreSQL {{implementation of}} SQL, Null {{is used to}} represent all UNKNOWN results, including the UNKNOWN <b>BOOLEAN.</b> PostgreSQL does not implement the UNKNOWN literal (although it does implement the IS UNKNOWN operator, which is an orthogonal feature.) Most other major vendors {{do not support the}} <b>Boolean</b> type (as defined in T031) as of 2012. The procedural part of Oracle's PL/SQL supports <b>BOOLEAN</b> however variables; these can also be assigned NULL and the value is considered the same as UNKNOWN.|$|E
5|$|Floating point {{numbers are}} also {{stored in a}} platform-specific range. They can be {{specified}} using floating point notation, or two forms of scientific notation. PHP has a native <b>Boolean</b> type {{that is similar to}} the native <b>Boolean</b> types in Java and C++. Using the <b>Boolean</b> type conversion rules, non-zero values are interpreted as true and zero as false, as in Perl and C++.|$|E
5|$|Karp's NP-completeness {{proof is}} a many-one {{reduction}} from the <b>Boolean</b> satisfiability problem.|$|E
5000|$|Let [...] be {{a set of}} vectors of [...] <b>booleans</b> each. The ugly {{duckling}} is {{the vector}} which is least like the others. Given the <b>booleans,</b> this can be computed using Hamming distance.|$|R
40|$|This paper introduces, in {{analogy to}} the concept of fuzzy numbers, the concept of fuzzy <b>booleans,</b> and {{examines}} approximate reasoning with the compositional rule of inference using fuzzy <b>booleans.</b> It is shown that each set of fuzzy rules is equivalent to a set of fuzzy rules with singleton crisp antecedents; in case of fuzzy <b>booleans</b> this set contains only two rules. It is shown that Zadeh's extension principle is equivalent to the compositional rule of inference using a complete set of fuzzy rules with singleton crisp antecedents. The results are applied to describe the use of approximate reasoning with fuzzy <b>booleans</b> to object-oriented design methods...|$|R
50|$|Values can be 64-bit integers, 64-bit {{floating}} points, strings, and <b>booleans.</b>|$|R
5|$|The F571 {{extension}} is {{orthogonal to}} the presence of the <b>boolean</b> datatype in SQL (discussed later in this article) and, despite syntactic similarities, F571 does not introduce <b>boolean</b> or three-valued literals in the language. The F571 extension was actually present in SQL92, well before the <b>boolean</b> datatype was introduced to the standard in 1999. The F571 extension is implemented by few systems however; PostgreSQL is one of those implementing it.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, Putnam {{is known}} for the Davis–Putnam algorithm for the <b>Boolean</b> satisfiability problem (SAT), developed with Martin Davis in 1960. The algorithm finds {{if there is a}} set of true or false values that satisfies a given <b>Boolean</b> expression so that the entire expression becomes true. In 1962, they further refined the algorithm with the help of George Logemann and Donald W. Loveland. It became known as the DPLL algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and still forms the basis of most complete SAT solvers.|$|E
5|$|In the clique {{decision}} problem, {{the input}} is an undirected graph {{and a number}} , and the output is a <b>Boolean</b> value: true if the graph contains a -clique, and false otherwise.|$|E

50|$|This can be {{done for}} other types (<b>booleans,</b> natural numbers, etc.) and their operators.|$|R

5|$|It {{describes}} how to translate <b>Boolean</b> formulas in {{conjunctive normal form}} (CNF) into equivalent instances of the maximum clique problem.|$|E
5|$|Python {{uses the}} words and, or, not for its <b>boolean</b> {{operators}} {{rather than the}} symbolic &&, ||, ! used in Java and C.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Boolean</b> type {{has been}} subject of criticism, {{particularly}} {{because of the}} mandated behavior of the UNKNOWN literal, which is never equal to itself because of the identification with NULL.|$|E
50|$|The first 4 {{types are}} not {{followed}} by any data (<b>Booleans</b> have two types in AMF3).|$|R
5000|$|In JavaScript, {{immutable}} <b>booleans,</b> immutable floating-point numbers, immutable symbols, immutable strings, undefined, prototypes—including lists—are reference types.|$|R
50|$|XPath 1.0 defines four data types: node-sets (sets of nodes with no {{intrinsic}} order), strings, {{numbers and}} <b>booleans.</b>|$|R
5|$|As Aspvall et al. show, {{a similar}} {{procedure}} involving topologically ordering the strongly connected {{components of the}} implication graph may {{also be used to}} evaluate fully quantified <b>Boolean</b> formulae in which the formula being quantified is a 2-CNF formula.|$|E
5|$|Outside philosophy, Putnam {{contributed to}} {{mathematics}} and computer science. Together with Martin Davis {{he developed the}} Davis–Putnam algorithm for the <b>Boolean</b> satisfiability problem and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem. He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|PHP 7 also {{introduced}} new language features, including return type declarations for functions, which complement the existing parameter type declarations, {{and support for}} the scalar types (integer, float, string, and <b>boolean)</b> in parameter and return type declarations.|$|E
40|$|We study {{a variety}} of ways to specify a two sorted {{structure}} involving the <b>Booleans</b> B, with constants true and false and a finite set D with an equality function eq to the <b>Booleans,</b> under the assumption that there is a constant (name) for each element of D. The specifications are evaluated with respect to several properties, like textual length, efficiency in execution and the use of special features...|$|R

25|$|The basic lambda {{calculus}} {{may be used}} to model <b>booleans,</b> arithmetic, data structures and recursion, as illustrated in the following sub-sections.|$|R
5|$|Python allows <b>boolean</b> {{expressions}} {{with multiple}} equality relations {{in a manner}} that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.|$|E
25|$|An {{instance}} of the <b>Boolean</b> satisfiability problem is a <b>Boolean</b> expression that combines <b>Boolean</b> variables using <b>Boolean</b> operators.|$|E
25|$|There {{exists a}} unique {{homomorphism}} from the two-element <b>Boolean</b> algebra 2 to every <b>Boolean</b> algebra, since homomorphisms must preserve the two constants {{and those are}} the only elements of 2. A <b>Boolean</b> algebra with this property is called an initial <b>Boolean</b> algebra. It can be shown that any two initial <b>Boolean</b> algebras are isomorphic, so up to isomorphism 2 is the initial <b>Boolean</b> algebra.|$|E
50|$|Note that <b>Booleans</b> and Naturals {{are defined}} {{in the same way}} as in Church encoding. However {{additional}} problems raise from propositional extensionality and proof irrelevance http://coq.inria.fr/stdlib/Coq.Logic.ClassicalFacts.html.|$|R
5000|$|In C++, <b>booleans,</b> characters, integer numbers, floating-point numbers, arrays, classes—including strings, lists, dictionaries, sets, stacks, queues—and {{enumerations}} are value types, while {{references and}} pointers are reference types.|$|R
5000|$|In Java, <b>booleans,</b> characters, integer {{numbers and}} floating-point numbers, are value types, while arrays, classes—including {{immutable}} strings, lists, dictionaries, sets, stacks, queues, enumerations—and interfaces are reference types.|$|R
25|$|The {{category}} Bool of <b>Boolean</b> algebras has {{as objects}} all <b>Boolean</b> algebras and as morphisms the <b>Boolean</b> homomorphisms between them.|$|E
25|$|Both {{of these}} bases allow <b>Boolean</b> algebras {{to be defined}} via {{a subset of the}} equational {{properties}} of the <b>Boolean</b> operations. For the lattice basis, it suffices to define a <b>Boolean</b> algebra as a distributive lattice satisfying x∧¬x = 0 and x∨¬x = 1, called a complemented distributive lattice. The ring basis turns a <b>Boolean</b> algebra into a <b>Boolean</b> ring, namely a ring satisfying x2 = x.|$|E
25|$|The {{semantics}} of {{propositional logic}} rely on truth assignments. The essential {{idea of a}} truth assignment is that the propositional variables are mapped to elements of a fixed <b>Boolean</b> algebra, and then the truth value of a propositional formula using these letters is the element of the <b>Boolean</b> algebra that is obtained by computing {{the value of the}} <b>Boolean</b> term corresponding to the formula. In classical semantics, only the two-element <b>Boolean</b> algebra is used, while in Boolean-valued semantics arbitrary <b>Boolean</b> algebras are considered. A tautology is a propositional formula that is assigned truth value 1 by every truth assignment of its propositional variables to an arbitrary <b>Boolean</b> algebra (or, equivalently, every truth assignment to the two element <b>Boolean</b> algebra).|$|E
