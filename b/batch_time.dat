At present, {{commercial production}} of lignocellulosic ethanol is limited due to the long hydrolysis times and requirement of large quantity of expensive enzymes. Therefore, reduction of the enzyme consumption as well as hydrolysis time is crucial and model based optimisation methods {{can be used for}} the same. A semi-mechanistic model with cellobiose, glucose, and xylose inhibition with Arrhenius based relationship between temperature and kinetic parameters and thermal deactivation of enzymes was used for the present study. Optimal control problem with temperature as control variable was formulated after considering two different objective functions. For the objective of glucose concentration maximisation at final <b>batch</b> <b>time,</b> the benefit of implementing optimal control increased with reducing batch times. For the <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> of 24 hours, the final glucose concentration increased by 3. 2 %. For the objective of <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> minimisation, the reduction of <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> was 5. 8 % and it was observed for a target glucose concentration of 45 [*]g/kg of cellulose. The use of optimal control can reduce the enzyme requirement up to 77. 8 % of endoglucanase and exoglucanase for glucose maximisation and 22. 2 % for <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> minimisation.

The objectives of this study were to develop the a simulation research on bulk polymerisation of styrene using 2, 2 ’ azobisisobutyronitrile catalyst (AIBN) catalyst in batch reactor by using ODE solver within MATLAB software and to determine the initial amount of initiator and <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> to yield desired values of monomer conversion (m) and the number average molecular weight (Xn) at fixed temperature 373 K. The results later on were compared with those obtained by Wan Ibrahim (2011) using CVP technique within gPROMS software and also the results obtained by Ekpo (2006). The model equations were developed and adapted similar to those used by Wan Ibrahim (2011) and Ekpo (2006). The model equations were posed as initial value ODE problems and solved using ODE 15 s solver within MATLAB software. The trend of results showed that the <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> for lower monomer conversion (m) was lower compared to the <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> for higher monomer conversion (m) for each number average molecular weight (Xn). The initial amount of initiator achieved in this study was lower compared to that obtained by Ekpo (2006) but the <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> achieved in this study varied with that obtained by Ekpo (2006). Comparing with the results obtained by Wan Ibrahim (2011), initial initiator concentration needed in this study was lower than that needed in Wan Ibrahim (2011) ’s study, but the <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> achieved in this study was much higher compared to that obtained by Wan Ibrahim (2011). As a conclusion, the use of ODE solver within MATLAB software in simulating the dynamic problem of bulk polymerisation of styrene was successful.

40|$|The {{operation}} of an industrial semi-batch reactor, {{in which the}} bulk chemical EHEC, ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, is produced, is studied and simulated. In the reactor a strongly exothermic polymerization reaction takes place followed by a slightly exothermic reaction, {{and we want to}} minimize the duration of the {{operation of}} the process. Various operational as well as quality and safety related constraints have to be met during the batch. The complete process model, derived from measurements, first principles, and reasoning about effects on molecular level, is stated. The model includes heat and mass balances of the reactor, a pressure model, models of PID controllers, the jacket and the condenser. Technical limitations, for instance maximal and minimal jacket temperature changes due to limitations in the heat exchanger, have been modeled as constraints. The equations have been implemented in SIMULINK, MATLAB and the model predicts the process variables rather well over time. During the first reaction, the model is not able to reproduce the jacket temperature to the desired accuracy, but the other variables have acceptable predictions. An optimization problem is formulated, wherein the total <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> is minimized under the constraints of the differential algebraic equation system and other constraints originating from the process, for instance limited pump capabilities. As a first step in optimizing the operation of the process, a series of simulations has been performed in order to decrease the total <b>batch</b> <b>time.</b> It is concluded that a 10 % shorter <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> than today is possible if the quality is discarded, and a 5 % shorter <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> can be reached while using the existing requirements for the quality...|$|E

The separations are performed in hybrid processes where distillation is combined with decantation for completing the separation task.

Three common classes of azeotropic systems were studied, classified under Serafimov’s topological classes 1. 0 – 2, 1. 0 – 1 a and 2. 0 – 2 b. The multivessel configurations were found to perform always better than the rectifier column, which requires from 29 to 88 % more time in order to perform a given separation. The elimination of the vapour bypass in the multivessel column is either impractical or it has a negligible effect on the <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> requirements.

The first three columns are operated as closed (total reflux) systems and the regular batch column is operated as an open (partial reflux) system. We analyze the effects of feed composition, relative volatility and product specification on the time requirements. The multivessel arrangements perform better than the regular batch column, which requires from 4. 00 to 34. 67 % more time to complete a given separation. The elimination of the vapor bypass in the multivessel column is impractical though it has {{a positive effect on}} the <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> requirements.

40|$|Because of {{increasingly}} stricter environmental regulations, steel plants are at- tempting {{to reduce the}} occurrence of (heavy) slopping, which can be accompa- nied by large ejections of dust. They are also aiming to increase their produc- tion capacity by e. g. investments in additional equipment and by improving logistics. Reduction of the <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> in basic oxygen steelmaking might con- tribute to the desired increase in production capacity if the converters are the bottleneck in production. Currently the desired temperature and steel composition are met by appli- cation of a ¯rst principles static model, which determines the required raw material input. This model is sometimes perceived as complicated. The set- points of the control variables such as the addition rates, the lance height and the oxygen blowing rate are based on standard operating procedures, which have been developed during many years of practical experience. Operators only deviate from these standard operating procedures when it is necessary, for instance, when slopping occurs. It may be expected, that both the <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> and the occurrence of slopping can signi¯cantly be reduced by optimizing operating settings. The objective of this thesis {{is to develop a}} dynamic control strategy for basic oxygen steelmaking which both reduces the occurrence of slopping and in- creases the production capacity by reducing the <b>batch</b> <b>time.</b> The development of this strategy would greatly bene¯t from the continuous measurement of im- portant process variables.

Therefore, modelling hydrodynamic behaviour is necessary and efficient to predict the biodegradation of pollutants. In this study, laboratory-scale trickling filters were filled with two different porous media (glass beads and plastic rings) and were fed by a synthetic substrate in batch mode. Total organic carbon (TOC) of the effluent was measured and retention time distribution (RTD) was determined by injecting NaCl. Results showed that medium had no significant effect on TOC removal rate (around 80 % and 60 % respectively for <b>batch</b> <b>time</b> of seven and two days). However, regarding the hydrodynamic behaviour, the effective volume ratio and hydraulic efficiency in the glass beads bed increased remarkably from 28 % and 18 % to 80 % and 70 %, respectively, with the reduction of dispersion coefficient (from 4. 55 to 1. 53).
