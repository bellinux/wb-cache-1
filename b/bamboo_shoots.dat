These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used {{to ward off the}} insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots.</b> These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} staple crops {{consumed}} during Han were wheat, barley, foxtail millet, proso millet, rice, and beans. Commonly eaten {{fruits and vegetables}} included chestnuts, pears, plums, peaches, melons, apricots, strawberries, red bayberries, jujubes, calabash, <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots,</b> mustard plant and taro. Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, sika deer, and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and soy sauce. Beer and wine were regularly consumed.|$|E
5|$|Pudús have various {{methods of}} obtaining the foliage they need. Their small stature and {{cautious}} nature create obstacles in attaining food. They stop often while searching for food {{to stand on}} their hind legs and smell the wind, detecting food scents. Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots</b> horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.|$|E
5|$|The {{most popular}} local snack food is Momos, a steamed {{dumpling}} containing meat or vegetables cooked in a doughy wrapping {{and served with}} clear soup and achar. Locals love Alu Dom (Spicy steamed potato curry) and various versions of it are served. For example, they add Wai Wai Mimi instant noodles over a bowl of Alu Dom and call it Alu Mimi. Another popular Tibetan food is 'Thukpa', which is a hot noodle soup with meat, eggs and vegetables. Kinema, Chhurpi, Shaphalay,(Tibetan bread stuffed with meat). Fermented foods and beverages are consumed by {{a large percentage of}} the population. Fermented foods include preparations of soybean, <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots,</b> milk and Sel roti, which is made from rice.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to obtain the map of LAB derived from raw materials (local from Semarang). Mapping of LAB required as an embryo data base of LAB from fermented local food from Indonesia. Samples were collected from Semarang i. e. durian (Durio zibethinus Murr.) from Gunung Pati, edible portion of jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lamk.) var. Salak from Gunung Pati, yellow <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoot</b> “betung” (Dendrocalamus mranggen) from Mranggen. After fermentation, microbes from samples (“tempoyak”, “mandai”, and yellow <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoot</b> pickles) were isolated using MRS agar. The microbes identified as LAB by their positive Gram reaction, spore-forming, negative of catalase activity, morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. In general, it was found 17 isolates from tempoyak fermentation which were identified as Enterococcus, 15 isolates from “mandai” were identified as Lactobacillus and 21 isolates from yellow <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoot</b> pickles were identified as Lactobacillus. Based on API 20 STREP and API 50 CHL, the results represented that bacteria of each sample were performed to confirm the identification as LAB. This research concluded that the dominant microbes in tempoyak was Enterococcus faecium, in “mandai” and yellow <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoot</b> pickles were Lactobacillus pentosus and in yellow <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoot</b> pickles was Lactobacillus plantarum...|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} land carnivorans, bears are plantigrade. They {{distribute}} their weight toward the hind feet, {{which makes them}} look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, {{and as a result}} mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots</b> as the animals feed.|$|E

25|$|There are {{thousands}} of species whose stems have economic uses. Stems provide a few major staple crops such as potato and taro. Sugarcane stems are {{a major source of}} sugar. Maple sugar is obtained from trunks of maple trees. Vegetables from stems are asparagus, <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots,</b> cactus pads or nopalitos, kohlrabi, and water chestnut. The spice, cinnamon is bark from a tree trunk. Gum arabic is an important food additive obtained from the trunks of Acacia senegal trees.

25|$|In the remoter {{areas of}} Japan, black bears can be serious crop predators: black bears feed on {{cultivated}} <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots</b> in spring, on plums, watermelons and corn in the summer, and on persimmons, {{sweet potatoes and}} rice in the autumn. Japanese black bears are estimated to damage 3,000 bee hives annually. When feeding on large crops such as watermelons or pumpkins, black bears will ignore the flesh, and eat the seeds, thus adversely affecting future harvests. Black bears can girdle and kill trees by stripping their bark for the sap. This can cause serious economic problems in Asia's valuable timber forests. In the late 1970s, 400-1,200 hectares of land had been affected by bears bark stripping Japanese conifers. There is evidence that 70-year-old conifers (commanding the highest market values) {{may also have been}} bark stripped.|$|E
25|$|Other {{challenges}} met {{those children}} who {{were too young to}} work in factories or were evacuated to areas where there were no factories that could accept student laborers. The demands by the military and a strict rationing system meant that even in the countryside food was scarce. Transitioning from inner cities to quiet, bucolic towns meant that the children were struck with a sense of alienation as they faced an unfamiliar environment, the growing resentment of their host families, and ridicule from local children {{when it came to the}} difference in accents or ignorance concerning agricultural tasks. One teacher who was evacuated with his students in 1945 kept a diary and noted the gradual shift in daily activities from education to agriculture to gathering activities. By the summer, students were even preparing for the eventual Allied invasion of Japan by training to fight with bamboo spears and throwing rocks at targets. The students spent part of each day cultivating gardens and some days they were sent out to forage for things such as wisteria bark and <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots</b> or bark; on other days they made charcoal and carried it from a distant mountain; classroom assignments included writing letters to soldiers at the front.|$|E

500|$|<b>Bamboo</b> <b>shoots</b> {{are more}} easily digested than leaves, exhibiting the highest {{digestibility}} in summer and autumn, intermediate digestibility in the spring, and lowest digestibility in the winter. These variations correlate with the nutrient contents in the bamboo. Red pandas process bamboo poorly, especially the cellulose and cell wall components. This implies microbial digestion plays only a minor role in their digestive strategy. To survive on this poor-quality diet, they have to eat the high-quality sections of the bamboo plant, such as the tender leaves and shoots, in large quantities, over [...] of fresh leaves and [...] of fresh shoots daily. This food passes through the digestive tract fairly rapidly (about 2–4 hr) so as to maximize daily nutrient intake. Red pandas can taste artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame, and are the only nonprimates known {{to be able to}} do so.|$|E
500|$|In the 1950s, major {{economic}} activities in Bintulu were the timber extraction industry, fishing, and Sago processing. In the 1960s, Bintulu {{was still a}} small fishing village, {{with a population of}} 5,000. No roads were constructed in Bintulu until 1969 when the first untarred road was built to connect Bintulu to Miri. The first bus that serviced the MiriBintulu route was owned by Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA). The MARA bus line was an initiative by the Malaysian federal government to provide public transportation for the people. The Iban villagers paid the bus driver with [...] "vegetables, chickens, <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots,</b> and other items". Before 1960, Bintulu was connected to Kuching by sea through a ship named [...] "Swee Joo". After 1960, the ship [...] "Chin Chin" [...] was added to the route. It took around 36 to 48 hours to reach Bintulu from Kuching, depending on the sea conditions. Due to lack of food supplies from Kuching, the villagers had to make do with limited food, and several villagers resorted to hunting in the jungles to supplement the food supply.|$|E
