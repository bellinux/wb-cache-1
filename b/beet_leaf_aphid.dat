5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid (Aphis fabae) {{is a small}} black insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of the}} order Hemiptera. Other common names include blackfly, bean aphid and <b>beet</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid.</b> In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves and on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of the shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and the honeydew it secretes may encourage the growth of sooty mould. It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological means. In the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E

Corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> damage in maize {{has been characterized}} in whorl-stage plants, but seedling damage has not been investigated. Resistance mechanisms in maize to corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphids</b> are not well understood. The objectives of these studies were to determine the role of DIMBOA (2, 4 -dihydroxy- 7 -methoxyl- 1, 4 -benzoxazin- 3 -one) in maize resistance to corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphids,</b> to document corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> feeding damage on seedling maize, and to characterize feeding behavior differences on seedling and whorl-stage maize;Inbred 41 : 2504 B (high DIMBOA) was colonized by corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphids</b> immediately upon seedling emergence. Inbreds B 73 and B 37 (low DIMBOA) were colonized in the three- and six-leaf stages, respectively. Inbreds C 103 and Mo 17 (low DIMBOA) were colonized in the six- and seven-leaf stages, respectively. Regression and partial correlation analysis showed no relationship between corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> colonization and DIMBOA. These data indicate that DIMBOA is not a primary resistance factor in maize to corn <b>leaf</b> aphids;Corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> feeding on coleoptile and two-leaf stage maize plants reduced plant height and delayed pollen shedding and silking. Grain fill was reduced when aphids fed on coleoptile, two-leaf, and four-leaf stage maize. Grain fill reductions occurred on inbreds B 37, C 103, and 41 : 2504 B, but not on B 73 and Mo 17. Corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> damage on seedling maize resulted in yield reductions;Examination of late-whorl stage and seedling maize indicated that 57 % of the corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> stylet tracks penetrated late-whorl stage plants through stomata. Eighty-six percent of stylet penetrations in seedling maize occurred intercellularly between epidermal cells and 8 % through the stomata. Fifty-seven percent and 79 % of the stylet tracks terminated in phloem in whorl-stage and seedling maize, respectively. Aphid damaged stomata may be important in explaining yield reductions in heavily infested water stressed maize;These findings indicate that corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphids</b> were capable of feeding on and damaging seedling maize, and that resistance mechanisms in maize to the corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> do not involve the secondary plant chemical DIMBOA...|$|R

Greenbugs (Schizaphis graminum) {{are known}} for their devastating effects on crops {{including}} cereal grains. Their saliva contains toxins, which break down the plants defenses and allow the aphids to utilize nitrogen from the plant.

To observe whether aphid feeding influences the success of other aphid species that later feed on the same plant, we designed an experiment which measured aphid virulence and plant damage.

The experimental design was of randomized complete blocks with four replications and 2, 25 m&# 178; plots. Disease severity was assessed weekly, using a diagrammatic rating scale, in ten plants taken at random and previously labelled. Disease severity data were used to calculate the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) for each cultivar. Same plants were used to estimate yield. AUDPC and yield data were submitted to analysis of variance (F-test, 5 % probability), and means were studied by the Scott-Knott test (5 % probability).

40|$|Exogenously {{supplied}} indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) stimulated ethylene {{production in}} tobacco (Nicotiana glauca) leaf discs {{but not in}} those of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). The stimulatory effect of IAA in tobacco was relatively small during the first 24 hours of incubation but became greater during the next 24 hours. It was found that leaf discs of these two species metabolized [1 - 14 C]IAA quite differently. The rate of decarboxylation in sugar beet discs was much higher than in tobacco. The latter contained much less free IAA but a markedly higher level of IAA conjugates. The major conjugate in the sugar beet extracts was indole- 3 -acetylaspartic acid, whereas tobacco extracts contained mainly three polar IAA conjugates which were {{not found in the}} sugar beet extracts. The accumulation of the unidentified conjugates corresponded with the rise of ethylene production in the tobacco leaf discs. Reapplication of all the extracted IAA conjugates resulted in a great stimulation of ethylene production by tobacco leaf discs which was accompanied by decarboxylation of the IAA conjugates. The results suggest that in tobacco IAA-treated leaf discs the IAA conjugates could stimulate ethylene production by a slow release of free IAA. The inability of the exogenously supplied IAA to stimulate ethylene production in the sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaf</b> discs was not due to a deficiency of free IAA within the tissue but rather to the lack of responsiveness of this tissue to IAA, probably because of an autoinhibitory mechanism existing in the sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaf</b> discs...|$|R
