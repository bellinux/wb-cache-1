It was another kind of [...] "white meat" [...] for me: and though, no doubt, I was incapable of digesting all Mrs Monnerie's views on life, society, and the world at large, I realized that if {{in the course of}} time it might be my fate to wither and wizen away, I should still have my own company and plenty of internal entertainment. I actually saw myself a little <b>bent-up,</b> old, midget woman creeping down some stone steps out of a porch, with a fanlight, under a street lamp. It curdled my blood, that picture.

50|$|For {{practicing}} quick-draw extensively, {{the very}} best bet is a Jordan holster sewn to a wide stout belt, with tie-down straps to secure {{the bottom of the}} holster firmly to your leg. It is best to prep a new quick-draw holster by putting the gun inside of six or seven gallon-size Ziploc bags and sealing each one, then wetting the holster thoroughly in a bucket of warm water with a little soap in it and jamming the gun into the holster to shape it, then letting the holster dry completely. Without the bags, the gun will be a loose fit in the holster. For uniformed police-officers, it does them good to learn how to unsnap the safety strap, which is snapped across the hammer to lock the gun into the holster, {{as an integral part of}} the quick-draw, without slowing or stopping the hand in that process. (Do not use a thumb-break safety strap for quick-draw.) A shoe-repair shop can sew a small <b>bent-up</b> piece of sheet metal to the bottom of the tag-end of the safety strap to hold it away from the holster and enable the extended fingers sweeping up the side of the holster to pop the snap on the safety strap so that it will fly up out of the way as the hand draws the gun.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bent-up</b> bars were {{extensively}} used as {{shear reinforcement}} in beams and slabs {{from the first}} R/C developments up to the 1970 ’s. Their use was justified {{by the fact that}} they allowed enhanced development of the tensile reinforcement at the same time they acted as shear reinforcement. New reinforcing bars (with reduced development lengths) in combination with shear reinforcing systems led however to the abandon on their use. Recently, interest has again grown on the use of <b>bent-up</b> bars in flat slabs. This is explained by their efficiency both as shear reinforcement (alone or in combination with stirrups) and as integrity reinforcement. In this paper, the results of 7 full-scale specimens (3. 0 × 3. 0 × 0. 25 m) reproducing the support region of an actual flat slab with different layout of <b>bent-up</b> bars are presented. The tests show different potential failure modes and allow understanding the contribution of this reinforcement to the shear-carrying capacity of the specimens. Additionally, the performance of <b>bent-up</b> bars as integrity reinforcement is discussed with reference to 9 half-scale specimens (1. 5 × 1. 5 × 0. 125 m) where the influence of the development conditions of the <b>bent-up</b> bars is clearly assessed.

40|$|Shear {{failure of}} {{reinforced}} concrete beams is often sudden and catastrophic. This sudden failure, due to shear, made {{it necessary to}} explore more effective ways to design reinforced concrete beam for shear. The reinforced concrete beams show different behavior at the failure stage in shear compare to the bending, which {{is considered to be}} unsafe mode of failure. The shear cracks progressive rapidly without sufficient advanced warning, and the diagonal cracks that develop due to excess shear forces are considerably wider than the flexural cracks. The cost and safety of shear reinforcement in reinforced concrete beams led to the study of other alternatives. <b>Bent-up</b> bars have been used in the past. New form of <b>bent-up</b> bars will be used. Cross bars will be welded to these <b>bent-up</b> bars making rectangles capable of resisting shear in a plane compared to single bar performance. The main purpose is to identify the most efficient shape to carry shear forces at the lowest cost. Several reinforced concrete beams were carefully prepared and tested in the lab. The results of these tests will be presented and discussed. The deflection of each beam is also measure at a given applied load. The propagation of shear cracks was also closely monitored...|$|E

BTTST provides an alternative connector system unique to CFS where CFS sections are usually thinner than hot-rolled sections and welding of headed-stud shear connectors is inapplicable. Coupled with the back-to-back arrangement of two CFS channels where symmetricity of the built-up section is restored, the resulting composite floor system has been proven to possess adequate strength, stiffness and ductility properties under static loads. The work has shown specimens employed with BTTST increase the strength capacities and reduce end slips of the specimens as compared to those relying only on the natural bond between CFS and concrete...|$|E
40|$|Shear {{failure in}} beams {{are caused by}} {{diagonal}} cracks near the support. Any form of effectively anchored reinforcement that intersects these cracks {{will be able to}} resist the shear stress to a certain extent. This project presents the results of an experimental investigation on six reinforced concrete beams in which their structural behaviour in shear were studied. All the beams were cast with the same grade of concrete, and provided with identical amount of main reinforcement. In order to investigate the contribution of the additional horizontal and independent <b>bent-up</b> bars to the shear carrying capacity of the beam, two specimens each were provided with horizontal longitudinal bars and <b>bent-up</b> bars in the high shear region. Two different quantities of additional bars in each of these cases were adopted. The fifth specimen was provided with sufficient amount of shear reinforcement in terms of vertical links, while the other one was cast without any shear reinforcement to serve as control specimens. The performances of the beams in resisting shear in the form of deflection, cracking, strain in the shear reinforcement and ultimate load were investigated. The results show that the shear capacities of the beams with additional horizontal and independent <b>bent-up</b> bars larger than 1. 2 % of their cross-sectional area are higher than that of the conventionally designed beam with vertical links. It may therefore be suggested that these types of shear reinforcement be used to ease the congestion of links near the supports...|$|E

Sixty eight push-out test specimens of cold-formed steel lipped channel sections (CFS) embedded in concrete planks which {{make use of the}} new proposed shear transfer enhancement called <b>bent-up</b> triangular tab shear transfer (BTTST) were tested in this programme.

The results show that specimens employed with shear transfer enhancements increase the shear capacities of the specimens as compared to those relying only on a natural bond between cold-formed steel and concrete. In this investigation, BTTST provided better performance in terms of strength. Furthermore the effects of different angles and sizes for BTTST, different thickness for CFS and different strengths for concrete are also discussed.

In closest vicinity to the mask, the growth profile revealed a <b>bent-up</b> shape which is associated with an increase in the bandgap energy resulting from the combined effect of growth rate suppression and higher Ga concentration.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} beams {{are designed}} to resist bending due to applied moments; however it is equally important to design them for shear {{in order to avoid}} sudden failure due to shear forces. This paper aims at studying the effectiveness and feasibility of the use of independent <b>bent-up</b> bars systems as shear reinforcement. The proposed systems are to replace the conventional stirrups and stand alone as shear reinforcement. The effect of different parameter involved in the shear phenomenon were reviewed in order to better understand the behavior of reinforced concrete beams when exposed to shearing forces. For verification, a beam with conventional stirrups was used as a control specimen to which the results obtained were compared. As was expected, all the proposed systems provided better shear resistance than the control; beam, this can be seen by the maximum loads at which they failed, the less cracks formed in the shear spans and by the type of failure where they all failed in bending except for specimen B 6. B 1 failed at load 220 kN, this beam was the control beams reinforced in shear with R 6 - 50 mm links. B 2, B 3, B 4, B 5 and B 6 failed at 245 kN, 230 kN, 230 kN, 240 kN and 240 kN, respectively. Specimen B 2 was reinforced with least amount of shear reinforcement of all the specimens, about 20 percent less than the control specimen, yet showed the highest resistance and the highest ductility where it failed at load 240 kN and a maximum deflection of 24. 51 mm. Similarly specimen B 4 failed at 230 kN and had relatively high ductility where the maximum deflection occurred at failure was 21. 71 mm. On the other hand B 3, B 5 and B 6 still provided more shear resistance than the control beam, however showed very low ductility where the beams failed at maximum deflections of 10. 5 mm, 9. 91 mm and 10. 22 mm, respectively. All in all, independent <b>bent-up</b> bar systems are effective in resisting shear and hence; should be used on their own and not only if combined with stirrup...|$|E
30|$|In the {{research}} {{presented in this}} paper, {{the density of the}} foam concrete varies from 800 to 1600  kg/m 3, which provide a good range of compressive and shear strengths. The connectors were placed between the two cold-formed thin-walled C steel embedment. This type of connectors is different to the normal connectors such as studs, channels and <b>bent-up</b> bars, which are widely used in the past. Its structural form is similar to batten plate or lace bar of the double-limb lattice column in the steel structure, which can effectively improve the overall stability between the two C-Channels. While it is used in the composite structures, it also can effectively improve the shear resistance of the composite members. The positions of connectors are set between flanges or webs. On the other hand, the relative thin wall thickness of C-Channel enables uses the self-drilling screws on the fast installation without drilling or welding. Laboratory push-out tests have been carried out on foam concrete and C-Channels with shear connectors to study the increasing of shear bearing capability.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{reinforced}} concrete patterns used in many countries until the First World War was the system of François Hennebique (1842 - 1921). The best known characteristics of the Hennebique design, which was used in buildings as well as in bridges, are the monolithic structure with continuous T-beams reinforced with <b>bent-up</b> bars overlapping the supports and the use of flat open U-shaped stirrups as transversal reinforcements. The reasons for the success of his company have been extensively studied. However, so far, the assessment of the carrying capacity of the system remains incomplete. The first part of this paper deals with the results of experimental bending tests up to failure performed on three full-scale T-beam segments removed from a narrow gage railway viaduct built in Braine-l'Alleud (Belgium) in 1904. They aim at identifying the mechanisms of failure.

30|$|In summary, the {{approach}} of fabricating three-dimensional micro-architectures by deterministic release and rearrangement of strained films has been extended to ferroic oxides. Careful investigation of the etching behavior shows a high selectivity of 1 : 9, 100 for an SRO film against the STO substrate. <b>Bent-up</b> cantilevers have been prepared by releasing pseudomorphic SRO/PCMO/SRO trilayers from an STO substrate. Patterning straight long trenches into such SRO/PCMO/SRO trilayers allows one to fabricate well-positioned rolled-up microtubes with large aspect ratios. The strain states of the oxide layers before and after roll-up have been analyzed by XRD, and the ensemble homogeneity has been checked by comparing the microdiffraction pattern of a single tube to the pattern obtained from the ensemble. This approach enables strain tailoring of three-dimensional oxide heterostructures in order to tune the magnetic, electrical, or optical properties. The layers in a microtube experience a strong linear radial strain gradient (Figure 4 b) which can be tuned continuously by varying the layer thicknesses, whereas the longitudinal lattice parameter is roughly fixed {{to that of the}} substrate. The effect of such kind of strain gradient in complex ferroic oxides is rather unknown and may lead to a new behavior such as a flexoelectric effect [26]. Furthermore, cantilevers and microtubes are less clamped by the substrate. Their thus expected larger strain responses towards electric or magnetic fields may enable an improved function for strain-coupled systems such as two-phase magnetoelectric heterostructures.|$|E
40|$|Punching shear {{reinforcement}} is increasingly used in flat slabs {{as an effective}} solution to increase their strength and deformation capacity. Several punching shear reinforcing systems have been developed in the past, such as studs, stirrups or <b>bent-up</b> bars. The efficiency of such systems is strongly influenced by their development conditions (anchorage, bond) and detailing rules. Codes of practice, however, do not typically acknowledge such differences, proposing {{the same set of}} design formulas for all systems. This approach is detrimental for some systems (with better detailing rules and anchorage characteristics) and does not provide enough guidance for design of others (not respecting codes ’ detailing rules). In this paper, the fundamentals of the critical shear crack theory are explained with respect to the design of punching shear reinforcing systems. It is shown that this theory provides a consistent basis for design of shear reinforcing systems accounting for their particularities and modes of failure. The results of 6 tests on full scale slabs (3. 0 × 3. 0 × 0. 25 m) with same flexural and shear reinforcing ratio but with different punching shear reinforcing systems are presented and discussed. The experimental results confirm that the strength and deformation capacity are strongly influenced by the characteristics of the shear reinforcing system. The results for the various systems are finally investigated within the frame of the critical shear crack theory, leading to a series of recommendations for design...|$|E
40|$|Cold-formed steel (CFS) sections, {{have been}} {{recognised}} {{as an important}} contributor to environmentally responsible and sustainable structures in developed countries, and CFS framing is considered as a sustainable 'green' construction material for low rise residential and commercial buildings. However, there is still lacking of data and information on the behaviour and performance of CFS beam in composite construction. The use of CFS has been limited to structural roof trusses {{and a host of}} nonstructural applications. One of the limiting features of CFS is the thinness of its section (usually between 1. 2 and 3. 2 mm thick) that makes it susceptible to torsional, distortional, lateral-torsional, lateral-distortional and local buckling. Hence, a reasonable solution is resorting to a composite construction of structural CFS section and reinforced concrete deck slab, which minimises the distance from the neutral-axis {{to the top of the}} deck and reduces the compressive bending stress in the CFS sections. Also, by arranging two CFS channel sections back-to-back restores symmetricity and suppresses lateraltorsional and to a lesser extent, lateral-distortional buckling. The two-fold advantages promised by the system, promote the use of CFS sections in a wider range of structural applications. An efficient and innovative floor system of built-up CFS sections acting compositely with a concrete deck slab was developed to provide an alternative composite system for floors and roofs in buildings. The system, called Precast Cold-Formed Steel- Concrete Composite System, is designed to rely on composite actions between the CFS sections and a reinforced concrete deck where shear forces between them are effectively transmitted via another innovative shear transfer enhancement mechanism called a <b>bent-up</b> triangular tab shear transfer (BTTST). The study mainly comprises two major components, i. e. experimental and theoretical work. Experimental work involved small scale and large-scale testing of laboratory tests...|$|E
