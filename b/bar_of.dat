5|$|Hygrometer: Prototype {{hygrometers}} were devised {{and developed}} in the hills during the Western Han dynasty in Ancient China to elucidate mechanisms of long-range meteorological fluctuations. The Chinese used a <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> charcoal and a lump of earth: its dry weight was taken and then compared with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as when the air was dry, the <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> charcoal would be light while the air was humid, the <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> charcoal would be heavy. By hanging a lump of earth and a <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string on the middle point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.|$|E

5|$|After {{being hurt}} {{in a fall}} in his bathtub after {{slipping}} on a <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> soap, Miller was expected to withdraw and the Republican leadership hoped for a deal as late as May 15, the day Miller was to hold a press conference Ohio political observers thought he would use to announce his withdrawal. However, Miller stayed in the race and the two incumbents faced {{each other in the}} Republican primary on June 2, 1992.|$|E
5|$|Lizards have skulls {{with only}} one fenestra on each side, the lower <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly {{attached}} which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.|$|E

5|$|The student <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> University College {{is called}} the Undercroft Bar (known colloquially as The Undie), due to its {{location}} in an 11th-century Undercroft. It developed from the original Junior Common Room, which opened in the early 1950s. It is currently run by the Food and Beverage Services Manager {{with the help of}} several JCR members.|$|E
5|$|Waitress Shelley Johnson (Mädchen Amick) {{is about}} to leave for work when her abusive husband Leo (Eric Da Re) demands she do more laundry. She finds a bloodstained shirt among Leo's clothes and hides it before he notices. However, he later realizes that it has gone missing. When she returns home that night, he {{questions}} her about its whereabouts, and savagely beats her with a <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> soap in a sock.|$|E
5|$|A long <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> Danish territories in {{the south}} and lack of {{sufficient}} year-round ice-free ports severely limited Sweden's access to Baltic trade. Nevertheless, the country prospered due to exports of timber, iron and most notably copper, coupled with the advantages of a growing navy and proximity to the Livonian ports across the narrow Gulf of Finland. Before the Livonian war, Sweden had sought expansion into Livonia, but the intervention of the Russian tsar temporarily stalled these efforts through the Russo-Swedish War of 1554–1557, which culminated in the 1557 Treaty of Novgorod.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "I've Got Rhythm" [...] example also {{provides}} contrast because the harmonic rhythm {{changes in the}} B section. Whereas the A sections contain a vibrant, exciting feel of two chord changes per bar (e.g., the first two bars are often Bb g minor/c minor F7), the B section consists <b>of</b> two <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> D7, two <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> G7, two <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> C7 and two <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> F7. In some songs, the [...] "feel" [...] also changes in the B section. For example, the A sections may be in swing feel, and the B section may be in Latin or Afro-Cuban feel.|$|R

5|$|As in the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, matches involve each player selecting two fighters to fight with. Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time, allowing the inactive character to gradually recover some life they might have lost. At certain points, an inactive character's life bar may flash, giving them a temporary boost in strength if they are tagged in. If the life <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> either of a player's fighters runs out, that player loses the round. If time runs out, the player who has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins the round.|$|E
5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the <b>Bar</b> <b>of</b> the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills). The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E
50|$|Henry I <b>of</b> <b>Bar</b> (1158 - October 1190) was Count <b>of</b> <b>Bar,</b> lord <b>of</b> Mousson and Amance from 1170 to 1190. He {{was the son}} of Renaut II <b>of</b> <b>Bar</b> and Agnes <b>of</b> Champagne.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of each round, player gets 4 <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> time. Time is replenished within a round by continuing, which continues the game with 3 bars, or remaining time if continuing occurs with more than 3 <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|R

5|$|Breathitt {{was educated}} {{at home and}} in the public schools of his native state. His family moved to Logan County, Kentucky in 1800, and he {{continued}} his education there. In early adulthood, he was appointed as a deputy surveyor in Illinois Territory. He then returned to Kentucky to teach in a country school. He invested his income in land purchases, and shortly amassed enough wealth to sustain him for a few years. Financially stable, he resolved to read law under Judge Caleb Wallace. He was admitted to the <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> Russellville, Kentucky in 1810 and opened his practice there.|$|E
5|$|Despite his severe manner Stevenson was {{extremely}} sociable, {{and he was}} often the centre of a lively crowd at the <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> the Garrick Club, {{of which he was}} a member. His home on the Sussex coast was called Truncheons, sometimes taken to reflect his authoritarian views, but the area had been known by that name for many years before his arrival. Following his retirement Stevenson called for the restoration of the death penalty for all murders, and made frequent guest appearances on television until his health and eyesight began to fail. Among the programmes he took part in was Granada Television's six-part series The Bounds of Freedom, broadcast in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Dr.Dre {{has stated}} {{that he is a}} perfectionist and is known to {{pressure}} the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances. In 2006, Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr.Dre had made new artist Bishop Lamont re-record a single <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> vocals 107times. Dr.Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his similar work ethic. He gives a lot of input into the delivery of the vocals and will stop an MC during a take if it is not to his liking. However, he gives MCs that he works with room to write lyrics without too much instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record, as noted by Bishop Lamont in the book How to Rap.|$|E

50|$|Because of its timing, {{the slip}} jig {{is longer than}} the reel for the same number <b>of</b> <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> music. In Irish stepdance competition, the tempo of 113 beats per minute {{is the same as}} other dances, but as each bar is longer, instead of dancing to 48 <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> music the dancer is only {{required}} to dance 40 <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> music (each of 2 steps). Stepdance judges prefer sliding motions with the feet and graceful movements that seem to slip across the floor.|$|R
5|$|In 1781, Greenup helped {{settle the}} area {{now known as}} Lincoln County, Kentucky where he spent time as a {{surveyor}} and a land speculator. He was admitted to practice law in the county court in 1782. Following Virginia's creation of Kentucky County in 1783, he {{was admitted to the}} <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> the district court of Harrodsburg and served as clerk from 1785 to 1792. In 1783, {{he became one of the}} original trustees of Transylvania Seminary (later to become Transylvania University.) He purchased two lots of land in Lexington and served as the clerk of the town's trustees.|$|E
5|$|In Charleston, in 1891, Flournoy {{founded the}} law firm Couch, Flournoy and Price with former West Virginia Senate President, George Edmund Price. The firm would later become Flournoy, Price, and Smith with the {{addition}} of Harrison Brooks Smith in 1894. On March 7, 1892, Flournoy and his partner Price were admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States. Flournoy and Price continued to expand their law practice into Southern West Virginia when they were admitted to the <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> Summers County in 1894.|$|E
5|$|In November 1960, Lord Stansgate died. Benn {{automatically}} {{became a}} peer, preventing him from {{sitting in the}} House of Commons. The Speaker of the Commons, Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, did not allow him to deliver a speech from the <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called. Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage, Benn fought to retain his seat in a by-election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An election court found that the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner-up, Malcolm St Clair, {{who was at the}} time also the heir presumptive to a peerage.|$|E
