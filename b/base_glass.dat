60|$|The {{reason of}} this second law is, {{that if you}} don't want the qualities of the {{substance}} you use, you ought to use some other substance: it can be only affectation, and desire to display your skill, that lead you to employ a refractory substance, and therefore your art will all be <b>base.</b> <b>Glass,</b> for instance, is eminently, in its nature, transparent. If you don't want transparency, let the glass alone. Do not {{try to make a}} window look like an opaque picture, but take an opaque ground to begin with. Again, marble is eminently a solid and massive substance. Unless you want mass and solidity, don't work in marble. If you wish for lightness, take wood; if for freedom, take stucco; if for ductility, take glass. Don't try to carve leathers, or trees, or nets, or foam, out of marble. Carve white limbs and broad breasts only out of that.|$|E

XRD experiments and SEM observations were performed to determine the crystallization mechanism in these chalcogenide glasses. While alkali halide such as CsCl is rejected from the glassy network in antimony <b>based</b> <b>glasses</b> leading to its crystallization, some gallium <b>based</b> <b>glasses</b> present a quasi-arranged structure which tends to reach a higher stability by crystallizing as Ga 4 GeSe 8 or Ga 2 Se 3. Thus, the amount of alkali halides introduced in antimony <b>based</b> <b>glasses</b> limits the crystallization rate to 20 % of the glassy matrix. Furthermore, the crystallization of gallium based phases having a refractive index close to the matrix one lowers the scatterings permitting to keep an excellent infrared transmittance with a crystallized proportion of about 40 %...|$|R

50|$|During the Roman {{period the}} cameo {{technique}} was used on glass blanks, {{in imitation of}} objects being produced in agate or sardonyx. Cameo glass objects were produced in two periods; between around 25 BC and 50/60 AD, and in the later Empire around the mid-third and mid-fourth century. Roman glass cameos are rare objects, with only around two hundred fragments and sixteen complete pieces known, only one of which dates from the later period. During the early period they usually consisted of a blue glass base with a white overlying layer, but those made during the later period usually have a colourless background covered with a translucent coloured layer. Blanks could be produced by fusing two separately cast sheets of glass, or by dipping the <b>base</b> <b>glass</b> into a crucible of molten overlay glass during blowing.

50|$|Silver halides {{are used}} in {{photographic}} film and photographic paper, including graphic art film and paper, where silver halide crystals in gelatin are coated on to a film <b>base,</b> <b>glass</b> or paper substrate.

Gelatin may also contain trace elements (such as sulfur) which increase the light sensitivity of the emulsion, although modern practice uses gelatin without such components. When absorbed by an AgX crystal, photons cause electrons to be promoted to a conduction band (de-localized electron orbital with higher energy than a valence band) which can be attracted by a sensitivity speck, which is a shallow electron trap, which may be a crystalline defect or a cluster of silver sulfide, gold, other trace elements (dopant), or combination thereof, and then combined with an interstitial silver ion to form silver metal speck.|$|E
5000|$|Glass-ceramics have an {{amorphous}} {{phase and}} one or more crystalline phases and are produced by a so-called [...] "controlled crystallization" [...] {{in contrast to a}} spontaneous crystallization, which is usually not wanted in glass manufacturing. Glass-ceramics have the fabrication advantage of glass, as well as special properties of ceramics. Glass-ceramics do not require brazing but can withstand brazing temperatures up to 700 °C. Glass-ceramics usually have between 30% m/m and 90% m/m crystallinity and yield an array of materials with interesting properties like zero porosity, high strength, toughness, translucency or opacity, pigmentation, opalescence, low or even negative thermal expansion, high temperature stability, fluorescence, machinability, ferromagnetism, resorbability or high chemical durability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, ion conductivity, superconductivity, isolation capabilities, low dielectric constant and loss, high resistivity and break-down voltage.

40|$|Compositional {{modification}} of United Kingdom high level nuclear waste (HLW) glasses was investigated {{with the aim}} of understanding the impact of adopting a ZnO/CaO modified <b>base</b> <b>glass</b> on the vitrified product phase assemblage, glass structure, processing characteristics and dissolution kinetics. Crystalline spinel phases were identified in the vitrified products derived from the Na 2 O/Li 2 O and the ZnO/CaO modified <b>base</b> <b>glass</b> compositions; the volume fraction of the spinel crystallites increased with increasing waste loading from 15 to 20 wt%. The spinel composition was influenced by the <b>base</b> <b>glass</b> components; in the vitrified product obtained with the ZnO/CaO modified <b>base</b> <b>glass,</b> the spinel phase contained a greater proportion of Zn, with a nominal composition of (Zn 0. 60 Ni 0. 20 Mg 0. 20) (Cr 1. 37 Fe 0. 63) O 4. The addition of ZnO and CaO to the <b>base</b> <b>glass</b> was also found to significantly alter the glass structure, with changes identified in both borate and silicate glass networks using Raman spectroscopy. In particular, these glasses were characterised by a significantly higher Q 3 species, which we attribute to Si–O–Zn linkages; addition of ZnO and CaO to the glass composition therefore enhanced glass network polymerisation. The increase in network polymerisation, and the presence of spinel crystallites, were found to increase the glass viscosity of the ZnO/CaO modified base glass; however, the viscosities were within the accepted range for nuclear waste glass processing. The ZnO/CaO modified glass compositions were observed to be significantly more durable than the Na 2 O/Li 2 O <b>base</b> <b>glass</b> up to 28 days, due to a combination of the enhanced network polymerisation and the formation of Ca/Si containing alteration layers...|$|E

Controlled twofold crystallization provides a powerful tool to produce special property combinations for glass-ceramic materials. The present study outlines the potential of precipitating Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 F as well as Sr 5 (PO 4) 3 F as minor crystal phases in Li 2 Si 2 O 5 glass-ceramics. <b>Base</b> <b>glasses</b> with different contents of CaO/SrO, P 2 O 5 and F- were prepared within the glasses of the SiO 2 -Li 2 O-K 2 O-CaO/SrO-Al 2 O 3 -P 2 O 5 system. Preliminary studies of nucleation by means of XRD and SEM of the nucleated <b>base</b> <b>glasses</b> revealed X-ray amorphous phase separation phenomena. Qualitative and quantitative crystal phase analyses after crystallization were conducted using XRD in combination with Rietveld refinement. As a main result, a direct proportional relationship between the content of apatite-forming components in the <b>base</b> <b>glasses</b> and the content of apatite in the glass ceramics was established. The microstructures of the glass-ceramics were investigated using SEM. Microstructural and mechanical properties were found to be dominated by Li 2 Si 2 O 5 crystals and quite independent of the content of the apatite present in the glass-ceramics. Biaxial strengths of up to 540 MPa were detected. Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 F and Sr 5 (PO 4) 3 F influence the translucency of the glass-ceramics and hence, help to precisely tailor the properties of Li 2 Si 2 O 5 glass-ceramics. The authors conclude that the twofold crystallization of Li 2 Si 2 O 5 -Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 F or Li 2 Si 2 O 5 -Sr 5 (PO 4) 3 F glass-ceramics involves independent solid state reactions which can be controlled via the chemical composition of the <b>base</b> <b>glasses.</b> The influence of the minor apatite phase on the optical properties helps to achieve new combinations of features of the glass-ceramics and hence, displays new potential for dental applications...|$|R
