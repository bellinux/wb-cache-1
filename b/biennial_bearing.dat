40|$|Traditional olive {{orchards}} {{are usually}} not irrigated in the Mediterranean basin, but at those latitudes, the yearly rainfall is frequently insufficient to support equilibrated vegetative growth and high fruit and oil production. This three-year field study investigated the effect of complementary irrigation on olive tree vegetative growth, fruit and oil yield during a <b>biennial</b> alternate <b>bearing</b> cycle in a traditional grove under semi-arid conditions. Adult olive trees (Olea europaea L. cv. Nabali Baladi) were subjected to complementary irrigation in 2011 and 2012 ('on' and 'off' years, respectively) with 6, 10, 15 or 20 m 3 of water per tree per season, which corresponded to 14. 2 %, 23. 8 %, 35. 7 % and 47. 6 % of the whole seasonal evapotranspiration (42 m 3 of water per year), respectively. Rain-fed trees were used as control. In 2013, no complementary irrigation was supplied, and any residual effects on the yield components were determined. Results showed {{that none of the}} irrigation regimes affected vegetative growth, or olive fruit size (mesocarp and endocarp), as fresh and dry weights. The fruit and oil yield per tree increased compared to the rain-fed conditions only when the threshold of 15 m 3 was exceeded, thus inducing a higher crop load compared to the rain-fed control during the 'off' and even further during the 'on' year. No residual effects were registered in 2013. The study showed that complementary irrigation of at least 35 % of the seasonal water requirement can produce remarkable positive effects on fruit yield especially during 'on' bearing years...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{adaptability}} of olive-growing {{systems to}} climate change is studied in the Sierra Mágina region (Andalusia) using an interdisciplinary approach that evaluates and makes associations across climate, water resources, and socioeconomic strategies. First, the evolution of rainfall and temperature during the twenty-first century is assessed at the local scale using 17 regional climate model (RCM) simulations. A 15 %– 30 % rainfall reduction is expected in the fall combined with a 7 %– 9 % annual reduction by 2030 – 50. Based on a regression model relating yields to rainfall, residual yields (independent of the increasing trend in the present period and from the <b>biennial</b> fruit <b>bearing</b> of the olive tree) are projected to decrease by 7 % and 3. 5 % by 2030 – 50 for rainfed and irrigated olive groves, respectively.

40|$|Apple {{trees are}} usually {{irrigated}} to avoid yield losses due to water deficit but {{the shortage of}} water has become a critical problem in apple orchards. Nevertheless, {{most of the studies}} that have been conducted on tree responses to water stress have focused on shoot, leaf and fruit growth during a single growing season. This study presents the results of an experiment performed over 8 years on Granny Smith trees subjected to well watered and water stressed conditions. The yearly production of growth units along branches and the yield components (number of fruit, yield and individual fruit weight) were recorded over the experimental period. Statistical indexes adapted from the <b>biennial</b> <b>bearing</b> index were computed to analyze the impact of water stress on <b>biennial</b> <b>bearing.</b> Trees subjected to water stress did not display any significant decrease in total yield. Nevertheless, water stress increased crop load (number of fruit per trunk cross sectional area) and the total number of harvested fruit over the experimental period. Conversely, water stress decreased the individual fruit weight whatever the year. The increase in the cumulative number of harvested fruit and crop load were mainly associated with a higher proportion of floral GUs under water stress, especially in OFF years, this leading to reduce <b>biennial</b> <b>bearing</b> in this condition. The observed increase in the transition probability towards flowering along branches was hypothesized to be related to a decrease in vegetative growth under water stress that can favor floral induction in the meristems.

During 2010 and 2011 crop load was manually adjusted from 2 or 3 to 17 fruits cm− 2 of trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA).

40|$|Because {{irregular}} bearing generates major agronomic {{issues in}} fruit-tree species, particularly in apple, {{the selection of}} regular cultivars is desirable. Here, we aimed to define methods and descriptors allowing a diagnostic for bearing behaviour during {{the first years of}} tree maturity, when tree production is increasing. Flowering occurrences were collected at whole-tree and (annual) shoot scales on a segregating apple population. At both scales, the number of inflorescences over the years was modelled. Two descriptors were derived from model residuals: a new <b>biennial</b> <b>bearing</b> index, based on deviation around yield trend over years and an autoregressive coefficient, which represents dependency between consecutive yields. At the shoot scale, entropy was also considered to represent the within-tree flowering synchronicity. Clusters of genotypes with similar bearing behaviours were built. Both descriptors at the whole-tree and shoot scales were consistent for most genotypes and were used to discriminate regular from biennial and irregular genotypes. Quantitative trait loci were detected for the new <b>biennial</b> <b>bearing</b> index at both scales. Combining descriptors at a local scale with entropy showed that regular bearing at the tree scale may result from different strategies of synchronization in flowering at the local scale. The proposed methods and indices open an avenue to quantify bearing behaviour during the first years of tree maturity and to capture genetic variations. Their extension to other progenies and species, possible variants of descriptors, and their use in breeding programmes considering a limited number of years or fruit yields are discussed.

40|$|Irregular {{flowering}} {{over years}} is commonly observed in fruit trees and {{is assumed to}} be, at least partly, under genetic control. This study aimed at predicting genotype flowering behaviours and at detecting QTL associated to regularity, in a multi-family apple tree population. Successions of vegetative and floral annual shoots (AS) were observed along axes in trees belonging to five apple related full-sib families, observed at two experimental sites. Sequences were analysed using Markovian and linear mixed models including year and site effects. Indices of flowering regularity, periodicity and synchronicity were estimated, at tree and axis scales. First indices were derived from the <b>Biennial</b> <b>Bearing</b> Index (BBI). A second index was the auto-regressive correlation coefficient between flowering in consecutive years. A third index quantified the synchronicity of meristems within the trees through the measure of differences in the predictability of flowering over years, from a probabilistic viewpoint. These three types of indices were used to predict tree behaviour and to detect QTL with a Bayesian pedigree-based analysis, using an integrated genetic map containing 6, 849 SNPs. The combination of the three indices efficiently predicted and classified the genotype behaviours despite few miss-classifications. Four common QTLs for BBIs and auto-regressive coefficient were highlighted (on LG 4, 5, 8 and 10) and one for synchronicity (on LG 9) in the integrated multi-family map, thus revealing the complex genetic architecture of the considered traits. This study proposes a posteriori sampling of axes within trees as a relevant and time-saving method to estimate tree flowering behaviours. Coupled to appropriate statistical indices, it is efficient to evaluate the tree breeding values for flowering regularity. In apple tree, <b>biennial</b> <b>bearing</b> appeared to result from high AS synchronism in flowering, i. e. with all axes alternatively flowering or not in a given year, whereas regularity resulted from either asynchronous alternating or regular flowering of AS...|$|E
