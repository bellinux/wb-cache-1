40|$|Abstract — Unified {{testing of}} {{multiple}} heterogeneous robotic software components is a challenging problem and many robotic systems rely on vendor-specific tools for testing {{and evaluation of}} individual subsystems. The consequence is often the unexpected interactions between components that arise during system integration. OpenRTM-aist is a distributed software framework that standardises the development of robotic systems while encouraging software reuse and improving {{the efficiency of the}} system integration process. The problem is the lack of a well-integrated simulation tool that provides a safe, virtual test environment for evaluating OpenRTMaist components. This paper presents a simulation environment for OpenRTMaist. As opposed to creating a <b>built-in</b> <b>simulation</b> tool tied to the OpenRTM-aist architecture, we use an existing general purpose robot simulator, namely Gazebo, because of its modular design and framework independent architecture. We show that by creating an interface layer to Gazebo, robotic systems developed using OpenRTM-aist can be tested in Gazebo simulation without modifications to the underlying software code. In addition, we demonstrate the interoperability between OpenRTM-aist component-based robot systems and Player client programs in achieving a global robot task in the same simulation context.

It has a <b>built-in</b> Petri-net-based <b>simulation</b> engine which shows key performance indicators for the modelled processes. Reference process models offered for Protos reduce modelling efforts by providing generic solutions which only need to be adapted to individual requirements. However, the user can neither inspect or interact with simulations running in Protos, nor does Protos provide any explicit support for the adaptation of reference models. Hence, we aim at a more open and configurable simulation solution. To realize this we provide two transformations from Protos models to colored Petri nets (CPNs), which can be executed by CPN Tools. The first transformation enables the usage of the extensive simulation and measuring features of CPN Tools for the simulation of Protos models. The second transformation creates colored Petri nets with dedicated features for process configuration. Such configurable process models can be restricted directly within the process model without changing the model’s structure and provide therefore dedicated adaptation features for Protos’ reference process models...|$|R

The environment is implemented within the commercially available software package MATLAB/SIMULINK. The report consists of two parts. Part 1 gives a detailed description of the AACS design environment. The heart of this environment is formed by the SIMULINK implementation of a nonlinear aircraft model in block-diagram format. The model has been worked out for the old laboratory aircraft of the Faculty, the DeHavilland DHC- 2 'Beaver', but due to its modular structure, it can easily be adapted for other aircraft.

The major highlight of this research being that the time consuming procedures of the DSOP solution generated for different substation arrangements using the proposed method is found to be significantly lower in comparison with the time consuming procedures of Monte Carlo-simulation solution or any other method used for the reliability evaluation of substations in the existing literature such as meta-heuristic and soft computing algorithms. This implementation gives the possibility of RBD simulation for different substation configurations in C/C++ using their path-set Boolean expressions mapped to probabilistic domain and result in simplest Sum of Disjoint Product which is on a one-to-one correspondence with reliability expression.

40|$|A RET network {{consists}} {{of a network of}} photo-active molecules called chromophores that can participate in inter-molecular energy transfer called resonance energy transfer (RET). RET networks are used in a variety of applications including cryptographic devices, storage systems, light harvesting complexes, biological sensors, and molecular rulers. In this dissertation, we focus on creating a RET device called closed-diffusive exciton valve (C-DEV) in which the input to output transfer function is controlled by an external energy source, similar to a semiconductor transistor like the MOSFET. Due to their biocompatibility, molecular devices like the C-DEVs can be used to introduce computing power in biological, organic, and aqueous environments such as living cells. Furthermore, the underlying physics in RET devices are stochastic in nature, making them suitable for stochastic computing in which true random distribution generation is critical. In order to determine a valid configuration of chromophores for the C-DEV, we developed a systematic process based on user-guided design space pruning techniques and <b>built-in</b> <b>simulation</b> tools. We show that our C-DEV is 15 x better than C-DEVs designed using ad hoc methods that rely on limited data from prior experiments. We also show ways in which the C-DEV can be improved further and how different varieties of C-DEVs can be combined to form more complex logic circuits. Moreover, the systematic design process can be used to search for valid chromophore network configurations for a variety of RET applications. We also describe a feasibility study for a technique used to control the orientation of chromophores attached to DNA. Being able to control the orientation can expand the design space for RET networks because it provides another parameter to tune their collective behavior. While results showed limited control over orientation, the analysis required the development of a mathematical model {{that can be used to}} determine the distribution of dipoles in a given sample of chromophore constructs.

Traits common to many of these sites include limited data characterizing the subsurface, the presence of long-lived radionuclides necessitating a long-term analysis (1, 000 years or more), and potential exposure through multiple pathways. As a consequence of these traits, the uncertainty in predicted exposures can be significant. In addition, simplifications to the physical system and the transport mechanisms are often necessary to reduce the computational requirements of the analysis. Several multiple-pathway transport codes exist for estimating dose, two of which were used in this study. These two codes have <b>built-in</b> Monte Carlo <b>simulation</b> capabilities that were used for the uncertainty analysis. Several tools for improving uncertainty analyses of exposure estimates through the groundwater pathway have been developed and are discussed in this report. Generic probability distributions for unsaturated and saturated zone soil hydraulic parameters are presented. A method is presented to combine the generic distributions with site-specific water retention data using a Bayesian analysis. The resulting updated soil hydraulic parameter distributions can be used to obtain an updated estimate of the probability distribution of dose. The method is illustrated using a hypothetical decommissioning site...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of sustainable food processes, which integrate technical and economic criteria, satisfy customer demands, and are less harmful to ecosystems constitutes a major challenge {{in a context of}} global changes (climate change, energy scarcity and energy price increase, [...] .). An interesting way to meet these constraints entails a systemic approach combining modelling, simulation, and optimisation. Although methodological tools have been developed in the chemical industry (Steffens et al. (1999), Azapagic et al. (2011), Ouattara et al. (2012)), this kind of approach suffers from a lack of available models that can be applied in the food processing industry. The aim of this work is to develop a framework for the ecodesign of food processes, with a focus on sustainable milk proteins concentrating systems. A systemic approach is proposed in this paper, involving process modelling and simulation of a highly energy-consuming milk process coupled with its associated environmental assessment. More precisely, the approach combines the use of a flow-sheet simulation software tool with a commercial Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) software tool. The process to be studied leads to the production of milk powder from whole milk. The main principle is to concentrate a fat-standardised milk with a number of unit operations, i. e., skimming, homogenisation, pasteurisation, evaporation, and spray drying. The energy consumption of concentration and drying processes alone accounts for 25 % of the dairy processing industry energy consumption. These operating steps thus require to be optimized to improve the overall performance of the whole process evaluated through the proposed systemic approach. Literature review about process simulation and environmental analysis in the milk industry demonstrated that both aspects are seldom simultaneously treated: environmental assessment is mostly achieved with fixed process operating conditions. The analysis of the necessary degree of granularity of the related models could lead to the selection of the Aspen Plus® (Aspen Technology, Inc.) software, because of its substantial unit operation models library, and a strong capacity to integrate and model new components (not included in its <b>built-in</b> database). The <b>simulation</b> results give the material and energy flows, which are analysed and compared with experimental results. The LCA of the process is performed with the SimaPro® software, and then discussed from a multicriteria point of view. Finally, the extraction of the environmental database of the milk powder process from EcoInvent makes it possible to carry out sensitivity analyses, and suggest scenarios which are interesting both from economic and environmental viewpoints...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{growth in}} system {{integration}} is making mixed-technology testing increasingly important. Complex heterogeneous systems embed today micro-sensors and micro-actuators {{in order to}} interface silicon-based microelectronics with the physical world, augmenting the computational ability of microprocessors with perception and control capabilities, thus expanding the space of possible designs and applications. Areas such as communications, video technologies, environment and process control, instrumentation and measurement, automotive devices, optical, biochemical, electrochemical and many other MEMS-based systems are benefiting from mixed-technologies. The success of these applications, as determined by their quality and reliability, requires the integration of comprehensive and heterogeneous test methodologies and tools into design and test environments. This special issue provides a nice sample of works dealing with this heterogeneity that bring new research and development in mixed-technology testing. It features 5 papers addressing characterisation and test, fault <b>simulation,</b> <b>built-in</b> self-test, fault tolerance and proactive diagnostics. The papers deal with MEMS, biofluidics integrated systems, microprocessors and board interconnects. Three of those are extended versions of the preliminary work presented at the 12 th IEEE International Mixed-Signals Testing Workshop, held in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 21 – 23 June 2006. The first paper, entitled “Thermal Transient Characterisation of the Etching Quality of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems” and authored by P. Szabó, B. Németh and M. Rencz, shows, through simulation and measurement, how efficient {{it can be a}} non-destructive test based on thermal transient analysis to reveal differences in the amount of material of etched layers of MEMS structures. In the paper “Fault Co-Simulation for Test Evaluation of Heterogeneous Integrated Biological Systems”, J. Kerkhoff and X. Zhang show interesting fault simulation results obtained from a heterogeneous integrated device combining biofluidics and industrial mainstream 90 nm CMOS/DMOS technology. The third paper, entitled “Pseudorandom BIST for Test and Characterisation of Linear and Nonlinear MEMS”, by A. Dhayni, S. Mir, L. Rufer, A. Bounceur and E. Simeu, proposes a digital built-in self-test scheme based on the pseudorandom technique to ensure high-quality test metrics for parametric variations in linear and nonlinear MEMS. R. Bastos, F. Kastensmidt and R. Reis discuss, in the paper “Design of a Soft-Error Robust Microprocessor”, the costs associated to protecting a commercial microprocessor, at RT level, against soft-errors. The fifth and last paper of this issue, “A Prognostic Method for the Embedded Failure Monitoring of Solder Interconnections with 1149. 4 Test Bus Architecture” by J. Voutilainen, J. Putaala, M. Moilanen and H. Jantunen, describes the feasibility of accurate low frequency measurements in predicting the breakdown of modern lead free ball grid array board interconnections. We hope that this set of articles will motivate readers to promote ever more research and development activities in the crucial and difficult domain of mixed-technology testing. Finally, {{we would like to thank}} all authors, the reviewers, the Microelectronics Journal Editor-in-Chief and Editorial Staff, for their valuable contribuiton to this special issue...|$|R
