This {{language is}} classified in its own branch from the western Malayo-Polynesian languages (Lampungic languages) and is still closely related to Malay and Sundanese and distantly related to Javanese. The Lampung language has two major dialects which is Api and Nyo dialects. The Api dialect are spoken by the people of Sekala Brak, Melinting Maringgai, Darah Putih Rajabasa, <b>Balau</b> Telukbetung, Semaka Kota Agung, Pesisir Krui, Ranau, Komering and Daya (those that practices the Saibatin Lampungs customs), and including Way Kanan, Sungkai and Pubian (those that practices Pepadun Lampungs customs). The Nyo dialect are used by the people of Abung and Tulangbawang (those that practices Pepadun Lampungs customs). According to Dr. Van Royen, there are two classification of the Lampung language which are the Belalau dialect or Api dialect and the Abung dialect or Nyo dialect. Komering, spoken by the Komering is also part of Lampungic languages but mostly considered an independent language of its own, separate from proper Lampung as the Komering people have a different culture from Lampung people.|$|E
50|$|Elements of Malay and Islamic {{architecture}} {{are incorporated}} into the finishes of the building. Fine decorative khat (Arabic calligraphy) {{can be seen on}} the inner curve of the dome and parts of the walls. The calligraphy work was executed by the Egyptian calligrapher Shiekh Abdel Moneim Mohamed Ali El Sharkawi. Aluminium grills of intricate design {{can be found on the}} doorways, windows and walls of the Mosque. The windows are fitted with blue stained glass to reduce the amount of light that can enter the hall. The resulting filtered illumination renders a bluish ambiance to the interior spaces evoking a sense of peace and serenity. The high ceiling has triangular panels of red <b>balau</b> and ramin timber wood that are set in crisscrossing pattern. The dome is constructed of aluminium and the outer surface is clad with vitreous enamel-baked triangular steel panels decorated with a rosette of verses from the Qur'an. The main prayer hall is over two levels, is fully carpeted and air conditioned and is one of the largest such spaces in the world. The upper gallery of the prayer hall is reserved for the use of female worshippers. The second floor houses a gallery, the ground floor contains the administrative office, conference rooms, library, reception and lecture rooms.|$|E
40|$|Museum is an {{institution}} that create awareness among the society throughout the collection that is being displayed. The foundation of Muzium Nelayan Tanjung <b>Balau</b> (Tanjung <b>Balau</b> Fishermen Museum) is important especially for the younger generation in its role conserving the fishermen’s culture. The main question in this research is to analyze the role of Muzium Nelayan Tanjung <b>Balau,</b> Kota Tinggi, Johor, in documenting the fishermen’s culture in Malaysia, especially in Tanjung <b>Balau,</b> Kota Tinggi, Johor. The objective {{of this research is}} to analyze the history of the founding of the Muzium Nelayan Tanjung Balau; to analyze the display in every gallery of the Muzium Tanjung <b>Balau</b> which includes the materials that is being kept for conservation and to review the activities that is being held by the museum. This analysis, which is focusing on the period of 20 years, beginning from 1994 until 2014, is to explore the history of the evolution and expanding exhibition at Muzium Nelayan Tanjung <b>Balau,</b> Kota Tinggi, Johor. The method of research is mainly library research by gathering primary and secondary sourcers. Apart from that, interview and observation were conducted to gain authentic info. The research is divided into 4 chapters. Chapter 1 deals with the history of early foundation of the museum; chapter 2 is on Main Gallery, chapter 3 is about other Galleries; chapter 4 is on Seasonal Gallery and the activity of the Museum and the final chapter is conclusion. Nowdays, the life and profession of fishermen are not well-known by others. With this type of research, it will help to conserve and provide useful information for future generation...|$|E
40|$|Many {{researches}} {{and development}} of new reinforcement material for concrete structure {{as an alternative to}} the existing reinforcement material which is steel have been done nowadays. Timber looked like another alternative which possesses high strength ratio compare to its weight even basically; its strength is incompatible to steel. This study's focus on the flexural behaviour of beam reinforced with timber and also to make a comparison between the laboratory test and theory applying the Reinforced Concrete Design to EC 2. In the result of flexural test, it showed that control beam which named STEEL carried the utmost loads compared to sample beam which reinforced with <b>Balau</b> and Meranti timber.
