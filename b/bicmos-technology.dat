The VCO {{consists of a}} CMOS-core and was designed and optimized concerning phase noise, current consumption and tuning-range by exploiting the potential of SiP-mounting.

40|$|The {{effective}} realisation of {{a modern}} HF-Receiver for Mobile Communications {{is a problem of}} topical interest. Especially Dual-Mode capability and compactness in the realisation of the receiver using a small number of ASIC's are actual demands. From this follows as the basic challenge to find out a suitable systemconcept for the receiver. Dual-Mode capability means in this context the possibility to use the terminal for both Cordless and Mobile communications. The project IMME has been concentrated on this task. As a suitable statement for the system the concept of the Direct Conversion Receiver (DCR) has been applied and DECT and DCS 1800 has been used as the standards realising a Dual-Mode situation. So the aim of the project is to develop an architecture and to test the realised Direct Conversion Dual Mode Receiver which accomplished the requirements of the DECT and the DCS 1800 standards and is realisable by a few integrated components. In the block-diagram the receiver is divided in three parts: RF-front-end (LNA, Mixer, Phaseshifter, VCO), Baseband-Module (Lowpass-(LP-) Filter, adjustable Amplifier) and the Digital-Signal-Processing-(DSP-) Module (ADC, Digital Signal-Processor). The RF-front-end and the DSP-Module has been provided to be realised by commercial components. The Baseband-Module has been realised as a special ASIC using an available <b>BiCMOS-Technology.</b> The outstanding results of the project are a complete error model of the DCR and an algorithm and a special adjustable mixer for compensating and avoiding DC-errors. The error-analysis is based on a deep insight to the physical effects of coupling between signals and of the influence of unsymmetry between then I- and the Q-paths in the baseband-module. Moreover the influences of parasitics coming from the integration are included. The adjustable mixer has been realised as an ASIC using <b>BiCMOS-Technology.</b> (orig.)

40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical {{study of the}} 1 /f noise and the thermal noise in double-diffused MOS (DMOS) transistors in a <b>BICMOS-technology</b> has been carried out. By using an analytical model that consists of an enhancement MOS transistor in series with a depletion MOS transistor and a resistance, and by attributing noise sources to each device, the noise in DMOS devices is simulated accurately. Three distinct regions of operation are defined: enhancement transistor control, depletion transistor control and the linear region. In the first region, the noise is strictly determined by the enhancement transistor. It {{was found that the}} 1 /f noise in this region is caused by mobility fluctuations and is very low. In the depletion transistor control region both transistors influence the total noise. Here the 1 /f noise is dominated by the depletion transistor. The series resistance is only of importance in the linear regio...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the project}} was the {{development}} of a SQUID system which is especially suited for unshielded measurements in disturbed environment. For this, dc-SQUIDs made of high temperature superconductors were developed with sensitivities down to 30 fT/sqrt(Hz). Because of the SQUID's large voltage swing a directly coupled SQUID electronics could be set up. This electronics was realized as an integrated circuit using a <b>BiCMOS-technology.</b> It was optimized for use at 77 K. The circuit works directly near the SQUID in liquid nitrogen. Bandwidth limitations caused by delay times originated by long connections between SQUID and electronics can be avoided. This SQUID system reaches frequency bandwidths of more than 3 MHz and slew rates above 3 x 10 " 6 #PHI#_ 0 /s. The extremely low input noise of 240 pV/sqrt(Hz) at a power dissipation of only 100 mW has to be emphasized. This SQUID system can even be used in heavily disturbed environment. (orig.)

40|$|The project 'Entwicklung analoger und digitaler Schaltungen und Systeme in BiCMOS-Technologie fuer niedrige Versorgungsspannungen' {{had been}} focused on two directions. The first was the {{investigation}} of monolithically integrated active IF-bandpass filters for the frequency range of 10 - 100 MHz aimed at the replacement of bulky discrete filters. The bandpass filters have been realized by use of Gm-C filter stages. The results show, that active filters for 13 and 120 MHz with very high quality factors can be integrated in a modern <b>BiCMOS-technology.</b> Nevertheless, power consumption and noise performance are at present not sufficient. The first drawback is only for mobile applications of interest. The noise performance yet has not reached its technical limits. Improved performance will be achieved by further downscaling of technologies and by further circuit optimization. The second aspect of the project work was {{the development of a}} high resolution interpolating measurement ASIC. The ASIC contains two input channels for sine and cosine input. Each channel consists of an analog I/U-converter, a #SIGMA##DELTA#-converter, a digial lowpass filter, and DACs for the calibration of the system. A resolution of about 10 bits and a signal bandwidth of 10 MHz has been achieved. (orig.)
