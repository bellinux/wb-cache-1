5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. <b>Beyond</b> <b>these,</b> the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E

During the years of the Anarchy in the 1140s, Worcester was successfully attacked several times; after the war a new city wall was built to improve the city's defences. The new walls, completed by the early 13th century, were constructed of stone and had three main gates. They were maintained in good condition into the 17th century.|$|E

He was honoured for his work running the Empire Air Training Scheme in 1940–42 and has received credit as CAS for building up the RAAF's strength to 70squadrons by 1945. After the war he played a personal part in improving education within the service, including the establishment of RAAF College, along similar lines to Royal Military College, Duntroon, and the Royal Australian Naval College, as well as the RAAF Staff College. One of his last directions as CAS was the formation of RAAF Museum at Point Cook, where it is still based.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beyond</b> <b>these</b> initial prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles {{himself by}} {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money.

Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Carolingian support {{may have}} been one of the factors that helped Ecgberht achieve the {{military}} successes of the late 820s. However, the Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed at some time in the 820s or 830s, and in addition, a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious—the first of a series of internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and <b>beyond.</b> <b>These</b> distractions may have prevented Louis from supporting Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.|$|E

5|$|The {{infantry}} {{scrambled to}} their feet and rushed forward while the sappers hurried to break down the sides of the antitank ditch with picks and shovels. They advanced on a series of posts held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Italian 115th Infantry Regiment. Posts 49 and 47 were rapidly overrun, as was Post 46 in the second line beyond. Within half an hour Post 48 had also fallen and another company had taken Posts 45 and 44. The two remaining companies now advanced <b>beyond</b> <b>these</b> positions towards a low stone wall as artillery fire began to fall along the broken wire. The Italians fought from behind the wall until the Australians were inside it, attacking with hand grenades and bayonets. The two companies succeeded in taking 400 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The toxins {{found in}} Galerina marginata {{are known as}} amatoxins. Amatoxins belong to a family of bicyclic octapeptide {{derivatives}} composed of an amino acid ring bridged by a sulfur atom and characterized by differences in their side groups; these compounds are responsible for more than 90% of fatal mushroom poisonings in humans. The amatoxins inhibit the enzyme RNA polymerase II, which copies the genetic code of DNA into messenger RNA molecules. The toxin naturally accumulates in liver cells, and the ensuing disruption of metabolism accounts for the severe liver dysfunction cause by amatoxins. Amatoxins also lead to kidney failure because, as the kidneys attempt to filter out poison, it damages the convoluted tubules and reenters the blood to recirculate and cause more damage. Initial symptoms after ingestion include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea which may last for six to nine hours. <b>Beyond</b> <b>these</b> symptoms, toxins severely affect the liver which results in gastrointestinal bleeding, a coma, kidney failure, or even death, usually within seven days of consumption.|$|E

5|$|This period saw a major {{expansion}} of la ville moyenne, which spread along the lower hilltops and {{slopes of the}} city centered around the French Residency. Modern urban planning was applied in la ville basse ("lower town"), which expanded {{from the base of}} the city's central hills into the surrounding rice fields. Major boulevards like Avenue de l'Indépendance, planned commercial areas like the arcades lining either side of the Avenue, large parks, city squares and other landmark features were built. A railway system connecting Soarano station at one end of the Avenue de l'Indépendance in Antananarive with Toamasina and Fianarantsoa was established in 1897. <b>Beyond</b> <b>these</b> planned spaces, neighborhoods densely populated by working class Malagasy expanded without state oversight or control.|$|E
5|$|When {{recording}} was completed, Gridneff asked Boucher {{if he had}} {{any ideas}} for a further season of Star Cops. Boucher felt that were the series to continue he would like to extend the setting further out into the Solar System, visiting the Mars colonies and the Big Ring space colonies under construction. He intended to achieve this either by transferring one of the existing regular characters to the Mars colony or by introducing a new regular who would be based there. The second season was never developed <b>beyond</b> <b>these</b> few basic notions as it was clear to Boucher from an early stage that there was little prospect of the series being renewed. Following Star Cops, Boucher went on to work as script editor on the long-running ITV police drama The Bill before returning to freelance writing while Gridneff moved on to work on the BBC drama series The House of Eliott.|$|E
5|$|To the north, the New Zealand Rifle Brigade {{suffered}} {{the attention of}} German artillery even before beginning to move forward at 1:00 am. The attack did not begin until 6:30 am, when three battalions of riflemen began advancing. There had been no time to arrange a covering barrage {{and there was no}} armoured support. Despite heavy machine gun fire, all three battalions made their initial objectives but made little progress <b>beyond</b> <b>these</b> due to the strongly defended villages of St. Aubin and Beugnâtre, both to the northeast of Bapaume. Beugnâtre had been thought to have been captured by the 5th Division and thus the German presence in the village was unexpected. By 10:00 am, the attack had petered out and the battalions were consolidating their positions, during which they had to fend off a counterattack from Beugnâtre. On short notice, a further attack was arranged for the evening with the aim of pushing forward to the road to Cambrai, this time with a supporting artillery barrage. The 3rd Rifle Battalion of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, in a salient between Bapaume and St. Aubin, was to test the defences of the town with fighting patrols. The 2nd Rifle Battalion was to flank St. Aubin and advance for the Cambrai Road alongside 4th Rifle Battalion, which would also link up with 5th Division, which had the task of taking Beugnâtre. However, instructions to the attacking battalions were issued late and several companies did not receive their orders until the barrage had already commenced. Brigadier General Herbert Hart, commanding the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, realising the inadequacy of the preparation time, tried to cancel the operation but to no avail. Despite this, Beugnâtre did fall to the British; advancing under a covering barrage, the King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB) penetrated the village relatively easily before encountering strong machine gun. Even so, the KOSB pushed the Germans out and this secured the outer flank of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. However, while the New Zealanders did reach the Cambrai road, they were unable to hold it and had to settle for securing the railway line to Cambrai instead, this line being a little {{to the west of the}} road. St. Aubin was also captured by the 2nd Rifle Battalion.|$|E
