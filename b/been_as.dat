5|$|A February 2000 {{story about}} organic {{vegetables}} on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests {{had shown that}} neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food {{was more likely to}} be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had <b>been</b> <b>as</b> described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of {{northern}} Europe. In the late-12th century, the Normans invaded southern Italy and Sicily; although they had the technology to build more modern designs, in many cases wooden motte-and-bailey castles were built instead for reasons of speed. The Italians came {{to refer to a}} range of different castle types as motta, however, and there may not have <b>been</b> <b>as</b> many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in southern Italy as was once thought {{on the basis of the}} documentary evidence alone. In addition, there is evidence of the Norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in Egypt in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of death tolls were {{reported}} by many different sources. Then-Mexico president Luis Echeverria {{as well as the}} HPC and EPHC claimed that 435people died during the hurricane. It was initially stated that 630people had died during the storm; however, this total does not include victims discovered by the Mexican army. During the afternoon of October 2, the local government had placed the confirmed death toll at 397. Two days later, the Bangor Daily News reported that the number of bodies found dead ranged from 400to750. By late October3, Mexican officials and a Red Cross spokesperson reported that 650bodies had been found. Meanwhile, a military search operation claimed that the death toll of the hurricane was1,050. By October6, local officials had abandoned efforts to retrieve additional bodies, citing safety reasons. Even though 650people were confirmed to have died during Hurricane Liza, officials estimated that at least 1,000people died. Within a week after Hurricane Liza, some feared 10,000people perished. In addition, some modern estimates suggest that the toll could have <b>been</b> <b>as</b> high as7,000.|$|E
5|$|About 1558, {{according}} to a date on a fireplace, Bess of Hardwick and her third husband, Sir John's son Sir William St Loe, added a north east wing with a parlour and chapel, which includes Tudor buttresses. Sir William St Loe was a soldier, politician and courtier. His official positions included Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, Chief Butler of England and Member of Parliament for Derbyshire. He died suddenly without male issue in 1564/5, which Mary S. Lovell suggests may have <b>been</b> <b>as</b> a result of poisoning by his younger brother. All his property was left Bess, {{to the detriment of}} his daughters and brother. When Bess died in 1608 the house was left to her son Charles Cavendish.|$|E

5|$|Although {{more common}} since 1995, few above-normal {{hurricane}} seasons occurred during 1970–94. Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to 1960, including many major New England hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933, a record only recently exceeded in 2005, which saw 28 storms. Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900–25; however, many intense storms formed during 1870–99. During the 1887 season, 19 tropical storms formed, {{of which a}} record 4 occurred after November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however, many struck in the early 19th century, including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on New York City. Some historical weather experts say these storms may have <b>been</b> <b>as</b> high as Category 4 in strength.|$|E

5|$|Although the Larry O'Brien Trophy {{has been}} {{compared}} with the National Hockey League's (NHL) Stanley Cup, it has never <b>been</b> <b>as</b> prominent as the NHL trophy. To reduce this discrepancy, the NBA has been actively promoting the O'Brien Trophy {{in recent years to}} generate more recognition and an iconic status for the trophy. After the Detroit Pistons won the NBA Finals in 2004, the trophy was toured around the state of Michigan, marking the first time the trophy toured around the state of the winning team. In 2005, the NBA Legends Tour was launched in New York City. As part of the tour, the O’Brien Trophy was showcased in various cities—including those that were hosting the playoffs—for fans' autograph and photo sessions. It was escorted by many former players, including Julius Erving, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell. In May 2007, the NBA unveiled the NBA Headquarters on Second Life, an Internet-based virtual reality environment. With this launch, fans could take pictures with the championship trophy in the virtual Toyota Larry O'Brien Trophy Room. In August, the trophy traveled to Hong Kong {{for the first time as}} part of the NBA Madness Asia Tour.|$|E

5|$|Amy was {{considered}} one of the worst typhoons to strike the Philippines on record. Making its initial landfall along with the concurrent eruption of Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin, the typhoon disrupted volcanic relief operations and forced the displacement of victims already displaced by the volcano. Cebu City suffered the worst impacts of Amy– most of the city's buildings were heavily damaged, and 29people died in the city. Strong winds and rainfall in the city associated with Amy also set records which still remain unbroken today. Damage there was estimated at 560million Philippine pesos. Along the east coast of Leyte, where Amy initially struck, ninety percent of homes were destroyed, and a large swath of coconut plantations were wiped out. In Panay, located on the western side of the Philippines, at least a thousand homes were destroyed in 41towns. Overall, Amy caused $30million in damage, and at least 556fatalities, though the final death toll may have <b>been</b> <b>as</b> high as 991, making the typhoon one of the deadliest in modern Philippine history. An additional 50,000people were displaced.|$|E
