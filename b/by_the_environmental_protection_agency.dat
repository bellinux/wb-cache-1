5|$|In November 2008, Hershey Creamery Company {{became the}} first company {{in the nation to}} be prosecuted and fined for failing to {{implement}} a Risk Management Program (RMP) as required by the Clean Air Act. The charges were brought <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Agency</b> (EPA), which stated that the company failed to develop the required plans with regard to its storage and use of anhydrous ammonia, which is a regulated substance. In the charges, the EPA noted that the creamery twice certified that it had developed the RMP plan, once in 1999 and again in 2004. Later inspection showed that the certifications were false and on December 7, 2006, the EPA issued a civil compliance order against the company, ordering the company to come into compliance. Hershey Creamery complied and in April 2007 submitted the appropriate RMPs, which were confirmed to be in-place through subsequent inspection. The case was heard at the Federal Middle District court of Pennsylvania, with Hershey Creamery pleading guilty to the charges; it was subsequently fined $100,000 and given a year probation.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{cooling water}} intake {{structures}} are regulated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Agency</b> (EPA). These structures {{can have the}} same impacts to the environment as desalination facility intakes. According to EPA, water intake structures cause adverse environmental impact by sucking fish and shellfish or their eggs into an industrial system. There, the organisms may be killed or injured by heat, physical stress, or chemicals. Larger organisms may be killed or injured when they become trapped against screens {{at the front of}} an intake structure. Alternative intake types that mitigate these impacts include beach wells, but they require more energy and higher costs.|$|E

The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions.
