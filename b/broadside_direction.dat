5000|$|An {{important}} {{fact that}} applies to SARs but not to real-aperture radars is that the direction of overlay of any scene point is not directly toward the radar, but toward that point of the SAR's current path direction that is nearest to the target point. If the SAR is [...] "squinting" [...] forward or aft away from the exactly <b>broadside</b> <b>direction,</b> then the illumination direction, and hence the shadow direction, will not be opposite to the overlay direction, but slanted to right or left from it. An image will appear with the correct projection geometry when viewed so that the overlay direction is vertical, the SAR's flight-path is above the image, and range increases somewhat downward.|$|E
50|$|Image {{resolution}} of SAR in its range coordinate (expressed in image pixels per distance unit) is mainly {{proportional to the}} radio bandwidth of whatever type of pulse is used. In the cross-range coordinate, the similar resolution is mainly proportional to the bandwidth of the Doppler shift of the signal returns within the beamwidth. Since Doppler frequency depends on {{the angle of the}} scattering point's direction from the <b>broadside</b> <b>direction,</b> the Doppler bandwidth available within the beamwidth is the same at all ranges. Hence the theoretical spatial resolution limits in both image dimensions remain constant with variation of range. However, in practice, both the errors that accumulate with data-collection time and the particular techniques used in post-processing further limit cross-range resolution at long ranges.|$|E

The proposed reflectarray with single-layer radiators employs a phasing element formed by a fixed-size circular ring attached by a variable-length arc phase delay line controlled by positive-intrinsic-negative diodes. The biasing network of the diodes is properly designed to minimise the interference between the radiating structure and the biasing circuit. To that end, the biasing circuit is placed on a substrate layer below the ground plane whereas the PIN switching diodes are embedded within radiators. The biasing signal is transmitted to the switching elements at the top layer using vias that penetrate the thin substrate layer, the foam layer and the ground plane. Investigations are carried out to verify the performances of the phasing element using a waveguide simulator.
