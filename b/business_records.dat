25|$|<b>Business</b> <b>records</b> exception: <b>business</b> <b>records</b> {{created during}} the {{ordinary}} course of business are considered reliable and {{can usually be}} brought in under this exception if the proper foundation is laid when the records are introduced into evidence. Depending on which jurisdiction the case is in, either the records custodian or someone with knowledge of the records must lay a foundation for the records, however. The use of police records, especially as substantive evidence against the accused in a criminal trial, is severely restricted under the <b>Business</b> <b>Records</b> exception. Typically, only generalized evidence about police procedure is admissible under this exception, and not facts about a specific case. For example, John is stopped for speeding 70 miles per hour in a 50-mile-per-hour zone. The officer, who determined John's speed with radar, records the speed in an incident report. He also calibrates and runs a diagnostic on his radar every day prior to beginning his shift. He records this in a log. At trial, the report itself would not be admissible as it pertained to the facts of the case. However, the officer's daily log in which he records his calibration and the daily diagnostics of his radar unit would be admissible under the <b>business</b> <b>records</b> exception.|$|E

25|$|Opponents {{of the law}} {{have criticized}} its {{authorization}} of indefinite detentions of immigrants; the permission given law enforcement officers to search a home or business without the owner's or the occupant's consent or knowledge; the expanded use of National Security Letters, which allows the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to search telephone, e-mail, and financial records without a court order; and the expanded access of law enforcement agencies to <b>business</b> <b>records,</b> including library and financial records.

Godfrey biographer Art Singer helped to arrange a permanent home for the Godfrey material at the Broadcasting Archives at the University of Maryland in early 1998. The collection contains hundreds of kinescopes of Godfrey television programs, more than 4,000 audiotapes and wire recordings of his various radio shows, videotapes, and transcription discs.

25|$|On 7 April 2009, a Manhattan {{district}} attorney charged a financier with the suspected misuse of Manhattan banks employed to transfer money between China and Iran {{by way of}} Europe and the United States. The materials in question {{can be used for}} weapons as well as civilian purposes, but some of the material can potentially be used in making engine nozzles that can withstand fiery temperatures and centrifuges that can enrich uranium into atomic fuel. The charges would carry a maximum of up to a year in jail for fifth-degree conspiracy and a maximum of four years for falsifying <b>business</b> <b>records.</b> David Albright, a nuclear weapons expert who assisted in the prosecution, said {{that it is impossible to}} say how Iran used or could use the raw materials it acquired.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, about 450,000 Korean male laborers were involuntarily sent to Japan. Comfort women, {{who served}} in Japanese {{military}} brothels {{as a form of}} sexual slavery, came from all over the Japanese empire. They numbered somewhere from 10,000 to 200,000, and they included an unknown number of Koreans. However, 200,000 {{is considered to be a}} conservative number by modern historians, and up to 500,000 comfort women are estimated to be taken. These women faced an average of 29 men and up to 40 men per day, according to one surviving comfort woman. However, of the 500,000, less than 50 are alive today. Comfort women were often recruited from rural locales with the promise of factory employment; <b>business</b> <b>records,</b> often from Korean subcontractees of Japanese companies, showed them falsely classified as nurses or secretaries. There is evidence that the Japanese government intentionally destroyed official records regarding comfort women.|$|E

25|$|The {{first version}} of the Patriot Act was {{introduced}} into the House on October 2, 2001 as the Provide Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (PATRIOT) Act of 2001, and was later passed by the House as the Uniting and Strengthening America (USA) Act (H.R. 2975) on October 12. This {{was based on the}} afore-mentioned Anti-Terrorism Act, but had been changed after negotiations and work between Attorney General Ashcroft, Senators Leahy, Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), Bob Graham, Trent Lott (R-MS) and Orrin Hatch. It was introduced into the Senate as the USA Act of 2001 (S. 1510) by Tom Daschle (D-SD) where Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) proposed a number of amendments, none of which were passed. Feingold amended the provision relating to interception of computer trespasser communications, limited the roving wiretap authority under FISA and modified the provisions relating to access to <b>business</b> <b>records</b> under FISA. The USA Act was later vitiated and indefinitely postponed, because the Senate and House bills could not be reconciled in time.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{was remarkably}} adept at {{recognizing}} new writing talent and making innovative works {{appealing to the}} public. More importantly, he functioned {{as a catalyst for}} experimentation by bringing disparate authors together. While Johnson promoted his authors, he retreated into the background himself. His friend John Aikin explained that he had [...] "a decided aversion to all sorts of puffing and parade"; Johnson's unassuming character has left historians and literary critics sparse material from which to reconstruct his life. For 200 years, it was assumed that all of Johnson's <b>business</b> <b>records</b> and correspondence had been destroyed, but in the early 1990s, one of his [...] "letter books" [...] was discovered in an old desk. It contained copies of letters written to business associates as well as friends from 1795 to 1809. His letters to other publishers discuss [...] "paper, printing, engraving costs, delivery dates, breaches of copyright, binding charges and accounts" [...] whereas his letters to friends include missives to Priestley, Maria Edgeworth, Erasmus Darwin, Charlotte Smith, and others. This material has allowed scholars to theorize more concretely about Johnson's life and work.|$|E
