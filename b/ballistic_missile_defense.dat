40|$|The Gulf War {{illustrated}} {{how important}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defenses</b> have become to the United States. The study of intercepting Theatre <b>Ballistic</b> <b>Missiles</b> (TBMs) in their boost phase {{was prompted by}} concerns about the widespread dissemination of submunitions and the differentiation of decoys from actual warheads released early in the missile's midcourse flight. Boost Phase Intercept (BPI) would alleviate this problem by destroying the enemy's <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> in the missile's launch phase, thereby causing the lethal payload and debris from the engagement {{to fall back on}} the aggressor. This thesis focuses on the development of missile tracking algorithms {{to be used in the}} boost phase of TBMs. A missile encounters significant changes in velocity, acceleration, and direction during the boost phase, making it difficult to track.

Simulation results and actual TBM profiles from test data are presented to verify the tracking accuracy utilizing different filtering techniques. NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
