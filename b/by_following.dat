5|$|Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) is a vendor- and device-independent {{mechanism}} for upgrading the firmware of USB devices with improved versions provided by their manufacturers, offering (for example) {{a way for}} firmware bugfixes to be deployed. During the firmware upgrade operation, USB devices change their operating mode effectively becoming a PROM programmer. Any class of USB device can implement this capability <b>by</b> <b>following</b> the official DFU specifications.|$|E

5|$|The British {{administered}} Mandatory Palestine after World War I, having {{promised to}} establish a homeland for the Jewish people. The modern definition of the region follows the boundaries of that entity, which were fixed in the North and East in 1920-23 by the British Mandate for Palestine (including the Transjordan memorandum) and the Paulet–Newcombe Agreement, and on the South <b>by</b> <b>following</b> the 1906 Turco-Egyptian boundary agreement.|$|E
5|$|The journey west usually took {{between four}} and six months, but the Donner Party was slowed <b>by</b> <b>following</b> a new route called Hastings Cutoff, which crossed Utah's Wasatch Mountains and Great Salt Lake Desert.

50|$|Next was the Elimination Chamber {{match for}} the vacant WWE Intercontinental Championship. King Barrett and Dolph Ziggler began the match as the first two participants. R-Truth entered at #3, and Mark Henry entered the match early at #4 after Barrett tackled Ziggler into Henry's Pod, {{breaking}} the Pod. Ryback entered at #5. Barrett was eliminated <b>by</b> R-Truth <b>following</b> a Superkick from Ziggler, Snake Eyes from Ryback and a Lie Detector from R-Truth. Sheamus entered at #6. R-Truth was eliminated <b>by</b> Ryback <b>following</b> Shellshocked. Henry was eliminated <b>by</b> Sheamus <b>following</b> a Brogue Kick.

5|$|The {{main idea}} of the {{algorithm}} is to find pairs of clusters to merge <b>by</b> <b>following</b> paths in the nearest neighbor graph of the clusters. Every such path will eventually terminate at a pair of clusters that are nearest neighbors of each other, and the algorithm chooses that pair of clusters as the pair to merge. In order to save work by re-using {{as much as possible}} of each path, the algorithm uses a stack data structure to keep track of each path that it follows. <b>By</b> <b>following</b> paths in this way, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm merges its clusters in a different order than methods that always find and merge the closest pair of clusters. However, despite that difference, it always generates the same hierarchy of clusters.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state {{that it is not}} clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that <b>by</b> <b>following</b> the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E
5|$|A {{connected}} component of an undirected graph is the subgraph {{consisting of the}} vertices and edges that can be reached <b>by</b> <b>following</b> edges from a single given starting vertex. A graph is connected if every vertex or edge is reachable from every other vertex or edge. A cycle in an undirected graph is a connected subgraph in which each vertex is incident to exactly two edges, or is a loop.|$|E

5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis <b>by</b> <b>following</b> the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches {{on this side of}} the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014 the {{kilogram}} was {{the only}} SI unit still defined by an artifact. In 1960 the metre having previously also been defined by reference to an artifact (a single platinum-iridium bar with two marks on it) was redefined in terms of invariant, fundamental physical constants (the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by krypton, and later the speed of light) so that the standard can be reproduced in different laboratories <b>by</b> <b>following</b> a written specification. At the 94th Meeting of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) (2005) it was recommended that the same {{be done with the}} kilogram.|$|E
5|$|Black mambas breed {{annually}} and mating {{occurs in the}} early spring, when male mambas locate a female <b>by</b> <b>following</b> her scent trail. After finding a potential mate the male will inspect the female by flicking his tongue over her entire body. As in other species of snakes and many other reptiles, fertilization is internal and the intromittent organs of the males are {{in the form of}} hemipenes. Females lay clutches of eggs with an incubation period of some 80 to 90 days. Like most snakes female mambas are both oviparous and iteroparous. Egg-laying typically occurs during the middle of summer and egg clutches range from 6 to 17 eggs.|$|E

5|$|By 20 December, {{arrangements}} for the delivery of emergency food and water supplies were made and expected to reach Carnarvon later that day. Supplies were also sent to outlying Aboriginal communities affected by the floods. After evacuating on 20 December, residents were {{allowed to return to}} their homes two days later in Carnarvon. However, most were left without power and clean water and required assistance from local agencies. Following the disaster, there were concerns that the Australian government could have prevented at least some of the floods <b>by</b> <b>following</b> through with a flood mitigation program. Dudley Maslen, the President of The Shire of Carnarvon stated that he did not want to place blame on any agency, though hoped for improvement during the future. More than 100 local government areas and regions were declared natural disaster areas on 21 December, encompassing areas from central Western Australia to the Pilbara coastline.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread <b>by</b> <b>following</b> the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
5|$|DE 9 was {{extended}} north to US 13 Alt. (now US 13) in Wilmington by 1959, being rerouted off Smyrna-Leipsic Road to follow its current alignment to New Castle, passing through that city on 6th Street before continuing along its current alignment to Wilmington. At this point, the entire route was paved. The current Reedy Point Bridge carrying DE 9 over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal {{was completed in}} 1968. By 1971, DE 9 {{was extended}} north to its current terminus at DE 2. DE 9 was realigned to bypass New Castle by 1984 <b>by</b> <b>following</b> Washington Street and DE 273. The intersection at the southern terminus with DE 1 was rebuilt into an interchange in 2009.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, Pound {{introduced}} {{two other}} poets to the Eiffel Tower group: his former fiancée Hilda Doolittle (who had started signing her work H.D.) and {{her future husband}} Richard Aldington. These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models, especially Sappho, an interest that Pound shared. The compression of expression that they achieved <b>by</b> <b>following</b> the Greek example complemented the proto-Imagist interest in Japanese poetry, and, in 1912, during a meeting {{with them in the}} British Museum tea room, Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were Imagistes and even appended the signature H.D. Imagiste to some poems they were discussing.|$|E
5|$|In natural settings, {{the black}} vulture eats mainly carrion. In areas {{populated}} by humans, it may scavenge at garbage dumps, but also takes eggs and decomposing plant material and can kill or injure newborn or incapacitated mammals. Like other vultures, it {{plays an important}} role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. The black vulture locates food either by sight or <b>by</b> <b>following</b> New World vultures of the genus Cathartes to carcasses. These vultures—the turkey vulture, the lesser yellow-headed vulture, and the greater yellow-headed vulture—forage by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. Their heightened ability to detect odors allows them to search for carrion below the forest canopy. The black vulture is aggressive when feeding, and may chase the slightly larger turkey vulture from carcasses.|$|E
