40|$|Urogenital {{infections and}} vaginal {{discharge}} are common complaints of swine producers and <b>breeding</b> herd <b>managers.</b> This {{is an area}} of great concern, not only for producers but also for swine veterinarians. This syndrome has been on the increase in recent years and is associated with intensive management of swine. Some of the manifestations of this syndrome are reproductive failure, poor performance, inappetence, and underconditioned sows. This is a source of great economic loss to the producer as reproductive efficiency {{is one of the most}} accurate predictors of swine enterprise profitability. Even so published information on this syndrome has only been available in recent years and is anything but plentiful...|$|R
40|$|The horse {{industry}} {{relies heavily}} on the <b>breeding</b> <b>manager's</b> ability to get {{a large number of}} mares bred each season. Therefore, it is beneficial to optimize use of the stallion and number of cycles per conception, both of which are related to the time of ovulation. Currently, methods exist to induce ovulation of a Graafian follicle; however there is no widely accepted method for delaying ovulation. Considering the main factors that lead to ovulation it could be hypothesized that the short-term administration of a progestin, such as altrenogest, would have the potential to postpone ovulation of a follicle that has reached ovulatory size. Twenty-six mares ranging in age from three to 23 y were paired by age and randomly assigned to a 2 X 4 blocked experiment. The factors were 1) stallion (Groups A-D) and 2) hormonal treatment (. 044 mg/kg BW altrenogest for 2 d) or control (Neobee M 5 oil for 2 d). Hormonal administration for each mare was initiated upon detection of a follicle with a 35 mm or greater diameter. Mares were artificially inseminated starting {{on the first day of}} treatment and continuing every other day until ovulation was confirmed by ultrasonography. Blood samples were collected daily throughout the estrous cycle and at 12 h intervals from the detection of a 35 mm follicle until three days post-ovulation. Samples were analyzed for luteinizing hormone using a double antibody RIA, for progesterone and estradiol using RIA kits (Coat-A-Count? and double antibody, DPC?). Short-term altrenogest administration increased the number of days to ovulation (P< 0. 05). Mean days to ovulation from d 1 of treatment for the control versus treated mares were 3. 15 d and 6. 12 d, respectively. There was no difference (P= 0. 65) between control and treated groups with respect to size of follicle at the time of ovulation. Luteinizing hormone, progesterone and estradiol concentrations were analyzed during treatment until 3 d post-ovulation. Altrenogest treatment had no effect on LH, progesterone and estradiol concentrations as demonstrated by the lack of difference between control and treated mares (P= 0. 27, P= 0. 56, P= 0. 67). There was no difference in pregnancy rates (P= 0. 62) between the control 10 / 13 and treated 11 / 13 mares...|$|R

40|$|The National Wildlife Refuge System {{is perhaps}} the most {{important}} system of federal lands for protecting wildlife in the United States. Only at refuges has wildlife conservation been legislated to have higher priority than either recreational or commercial activities. Presently, private ranchers and farmers graze cattle on 981, 954 ha and harvest hay on 12, 021 ha at 123 National Wildlife Refuges. US Fish and Wildlife Service policy is to permit these uses primarily when needed to benefit refuge wildlife. To evaluate the success of this policy, I surveyed grassland management practices at the 123 refuges. The survey results indicate that in fiscal year 1980 there were 374, 849 animal unit months (AUMs) of cattle grazing, or 41 % more than was reported by the Fish and Wildlife Service. According to managers' opinions, 86 species of wildlife are positively affected and 82 are negatively affected by refuge cattle grazing or haying. However, quantitative field studies of the effect of cattle grazing and haying on wildlife coupled with the survey data on how refuge programs are implemented suggest that these activities are impeding the goal of wildlife conservation. Particular management problems uncovered by the survey include overgrazing of riparian habitats, wildlife mortality due to collisions with cattle fences, and mowing of migratory bird habitat during the <b>breeding</b> season. <b>Managers</b> reported that they spend $ 919, 740 administering cattle grazing and haying; thus refuge grazing and haying programs are also expensive. At any single refuge these uses occupy up to 50 % of refuge funds and 55 % of staff time. In light of these results, prescribed burning may be a better wildlife management option than is either cattle grazing or haying...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-six birds from {{a parrot}} relief and {{breeding}} centre, {{as well as}} the manager, were examined for the presence of Chlamydophila psittaci. In the relief unit, 5 of 20 African grey parrots showed depression, ruffled feathers, loss of weight and mild dyspnoea. The birds received no antibiotic treatment. Birds of the breeding unit, 14 blue and gold macaws and 2 green-winged macaws, were healthy. They received doxycycline at the start of each <b>breeding</b> season. The <b>manager</b> complained of shortness of breath but took no medication. Using a nested PCR enzyme immunoassay (EIA), Cp. psittaci was detected in the faeces of all five sick birds, as well as in a nasal and pharyngeal swab from the manager. The veterinarian and her assistant became infected while sampling the parrots, as pharyngeal and nasal swabs from both were positive by nested PCR/EIA after visiting the parrot relief and breeding centre, but they showed no clinical signs of infection. Bacteria could be isolated from three of five nested PCR/EIA-positive birds, the manager and the veterinarian, but not from the veterinary assistant. Using an ompA genotype-specific real-time PCR, Cp. psittaci genotype E/B was identified as the transmitted strain. All breeding birds tested negative for Cp. psittaci. This {{is believed to be the}} first report on Cp. psittaci genotype E/B transmission from parrots to humans. In contradiction to genotype A strains, which are thought to be highly virulent to both birds and men, the currently described genotype E/B strain apparently caused no severe clinical symptoms in either parrots or humans...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{why some}} mature females of New Zealand's critically endangered parrot, the kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), {{did not attempt}} to breed during the 2005 breeding season on Codfish Island. At a population level, the initiation of kakapo breeding appears to correspond with years of mast fruiting of rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) trees, with the proportion of females that breed each season dependent on the quantity of rimu fruit available. This research investigates possible links between habitat quality within individual home ranges and the breeding status of adult females during 2005, when the abundance of available rimu fruit was low. We assessed the importance of both home range size and habitat characteristics in determining breeding attempts. Foraging home ranges were characterised using radio-tracking and triangulation techniques. The relative importance of habitat variables in optimal breeding habitat was assessed using ecological niche factor analysis. Our results show that female kakapo breeding in 2005 had, on average, home ranges twice the size of those females that did not breed that season and the ranges contained a significantly greater quantity of mature rimu forest. Multivariate analysis illustrates female kakapo were effectively partitioning available habitat, as breeders' foraging locations were positively correlated with high-abundance rimu forest with a tall canopy, described as optimal breeding habitat. In contrast non-breeders' locations were weakly correlated with short forest containing little or no mature rimu forest. To maximise reproductive output each <b>breeding</b> season, conservation <b>managers</b> need to ensure that all breeding-aged females occupy optimal breeding habitat on Codfish Island. Removal to other islands of kakapo not required in the breeding population may enable females to increase their home range size and occupy better breeding habitat. © New Zealand Ecological Society...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{harvest of}} {{renewable}} natural resources is predicated on the theory of density-dependent population growth (Hilborn et al. 1995). This theory predicts a negative relationship between the intrinsic rate of population growth and population density (i. e., number of individuals per unit of limiting resource) due to intraspecific competition for resources. In a relatively stable environment, unharvested populations tend to settle around an equilibrium where births balance deaths. Populations respond to harvest losses by increasing reproductive output or through decreased natural mortality because more resources are available per individual. Population size eventually settles around a new equilibrium and the harvest, if not too heavy, can be sustained without destroying the <b>breeding</b> stock. Resource <b>managers</b> typically attempt to maximize the sustainable harvest by driving population density to a level that maximizes the intrinsic rate of population growth (Beddington and May 1977). Although the theoretical basis for harvesting renewable resources is fairly straightforward, the practice of harvest management has {{had its share of}} difficulties. History is replete with cases where uncontrolled variation in harvests or the environment, naive assumptions about system response, and management policies with short time horizons have led to resource collapse (Ludwig et al. 1993). To be successful, sustainable harvesting depends on an ability to effectively regulate the size of the harvest, on a sound understanding of the biological system and its density-dependent responses, and on management objectives that are congruent with the renewal capacity of the resource. Even with a firm commitment to long-term resource conservation, harvest managers always will be burdened by complex, dynamic systems that are only partially observable, and by management controls that are indirect and limited. It is for these reasons that a coherent framework for managing ecological risk is necessary. Harvest management decisions involve three fundamental components: (1) unambiguous objectives; (2) a set of alternative harvest actions, including any constraints on those actions; and (3) the predicted consequences of those actions in terms that are relevant to the stated management objectives. The consequences of harvest actions cannot be predicted with certainty, and the associated risk is what makes management decisions difficult. I define risk as the probability of a management outcome, where the probability can be assessed reliably from past experience with the resource or with a similar biological system. Thus, risk differs from true uncertainty, in which past experience provides no guide for the future (Costanza and Cornwell 1992). In keeping with the definitions in this book, ecological risk assessment involves associating empirical probabilities of possible system responses with alternative management actions. Ecological risk management then is the process of using management objectives to value those (probabilistic) responses so that a preferred management action can be identified...|$|R
