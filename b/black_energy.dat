60|$|The Sessionses {{lived in}} a flat on Amsterdam Avenue near Ninety-sixth Street. They all went up from Cortlandt Street in the Subway, which was still new and miraculous in 1905. For five minutes Una was terrified by the jam of people, the blind roar through {{tunneled}} darkness, {{the sense of being}} powerlessly hurled forward in a mass of ungovernable steel. But nothing particularly fatal happened; and she grew proud {{to be part of this}} <b>black</b> <b>energy,</b> and contentedly swung by a strap.|$|E

A train rushed with a roar and clatter into the throat of the great tunnel and was immediately silenced; its rear lights twinkled and vanished, and then out of that huge black throat came wisps of white steam and curled slowly upward like lazy snakes until they caught the slanting sunshine. For {{the first time the}} day betrayed a softness and touched this scene of <b>black</b> <b>energy</b> to gold. All late afternoons are beautiful, whatever the day has been--if only there is a gleam of sun. And now a kind of mechanical greatness took the place of mere black disorder in the bishop's perception of his see. It was harsh, it was vast and strong, it was no lamb he had to rule but a dragon. Would it ever be given to him to overcome his dragon, to lead it home, and bless it? ...|$|E
