40|$|We {{consider}} a uniÐed model of Fe ion acceleration {{in the solar}} corona. The model comprises charge-changing processes, Coulomb energy losses, and both regular and stochastic acceleration. At a given acceleration scenario, the type of acceleration is {{found to have a}} minor e†ect on the mean charge states, but the shapes of the charge-state distributions produced by regular acceleration and by stochastic accel-eration are di†erent. During a continual acceleration at coronal temperatures, iron ions typically follow rising trajectories on the charge-energy plane. These trajectories are situated below the mean <b>equilibrium</b> <b>charge</b> curve deÐned from the balance of ionization and recombination at Ðxed energy. During stopping, the iron ions cross the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>charge</b> curve and run through a series of charge states above the mean <b>equilibrium</b> <b>charge</b> at current energy, because the Coulomb deceleration rate signiÐcantly exceeds the rate of the ion recombination in a hot plasma. As a result, the variety of possible trajectories on the ion charge-energy plane turns out to be much wider than would be expected based on the equilibrium charge-state approximation. In particular, we Ðnd dynamical cycles in charge and energy, so that acceler-ated and highly stripped ions may reappear at low energies. We also Ðnd that the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>charge</b> curve cannot be reproduced without strong reduction in the total number of accelerated particles. This implies that the observed iron charge-state distributions essentially depend on the scenario of their accel-eration and transport...|$|R

A 1 -D position sensitive Parallel Grid Avalanche Counter detector (PGAC) was used at the exit of a spectrograph magnet, enabling us to measure the intensity of several charge states simultaneously. The number of charge states measured for each beam constituted more than 99 % of the total <b>equilibrium</b> <b>charge</b> state distribution for that elements.

40|$|The {{charge state}} {{approach}} {{has been applied to}} describe the electronic stopping powers of swift O, N and B ions in carbon. According to the charge state model, the contributions to the electronic stopping power of energetic projectiles passing through solid targets are due to collisional interactions and the charge-exchange process.

This approach requires knowledge of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>charge</b> state distributions and of the charge-exchange cross sections for both electronic capture and loss processes.

40|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{charge state}} of uranium ions traveling through a fully ionized hydrogen plasma has been theoretically studied and compared {{with one of}} the first energy loss experiments in plasmas, carried out at GSI-Darmstadt by Hoffmann et al. in the 90 's. For this purpose, two different methods to estimate the instantaneous charge state of the projectile have been employed: (1) rate equations using ionization and recombination cross sections, and (2) <b>equilibrium</b> <b>charge</b> state formulas for plasmas. Also, the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>charge</b> state has been obtained using these ionization and recombination cross sections, and compared with the former equilibrium formulas. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>charge</b> state of projectiles in plasmas is not always reached, it depends mainly on the projectile velocity and the plasma density. Therefore, a non-equilibrium or an instantaneous description of the projectile charge is necessary. The charge state of projectile ions cannot be measured, except after exiting the target, and experimental data remain very scarce. Thus, the validity of our charge state model is checked by comparing the theoretical predictions with an energy loss experiment, as the energy loss has a generally quadratic dependence on the projectile charge state. The dielectric formalism has been used to calculate the plasma stopping power including the Brandt-Kitagawa (BK) model to describe the charge distribution of the projectile. In this charge distribution, the instantaneous number of bound electrons instead of the equilibrium number has been taken into account. Comparing our theoretical predictions with experiments, it is shown the necessity of including the instantaneous charge state and the BK charge distribution for a correct energy loss estimation. The results also show that the initial charge state has a strong influence in order to estimate the energy loss of the uranium ions. Comment: 27 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

In order to achieve this goal, upgrade programs are already in progress; the programs include {{the construction of a new}} 28 -GHz superconducting electron cyclotron resonance ion source and a new injector linac. However, the most serious problem, that of a charge stripper for high-power uranium beams, still remains unsolved, despite extensive research and development work using large foils mounted on a rotating cylinder and a N_{ 2 } gas stripper. A gas stripper is free from problems related to lifetime, though the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>charge</b> state in this stripper is considerably lower than that in a carbon foil, owing to the absence of the density effect. Nevertheless, the merits of gas strippers motivated us to develop a low-Z gas stripper to achieve a higher <b>equilibrium</b> <b>charge</b> state even in gases.
