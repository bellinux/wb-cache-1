50|$|The hairy-fronted muntjac or <b>black</b> <b>muntjac</b> (Muntiacus crinifrons) {{is a type}} of deer {{currently}} {{found in}} Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi and Fujian in southeastern China. It is considered to be endangered, possibly down to as few as 5-10,000 individuals spread over a wide area. Reports of hairy-fronted muntjacs from Burma result from considering the hairy-fronted muntjac and Gongshan muntjac as the same species. This suggestion is controversial. It is similar in size to the common muntjac.|$|E
5000|$|Tianmu {{is known}} for giant Japanese cedars, waterfalls, Tianmu tea, peaks {{surrounded}} by clouds, bamboo shoots, temples and nunneries, and odd-shaped rocks. More than 2,000 species of plants grow on the mountain, including (on West Tianmu) the last surviving truly wild population of Ginkgo trees. Prominent among the Japanese cedars is the [...] "Giant Tree King", named by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing. In 2009, it measured 26.5 m in height, 2.33 m in diameter, and [...] in volume. The mountain {{is also home to}} hundreds of species of birds and animals, including 39 endangered or protected species. These include the clouded leopard and the <b>black</b> <b>muntjac.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>black</b> <b>muntjac</b> (Muntiacus crinifrons, 2 n =  8 ♀/ 9 ♂) is a {{critically}} endangered mammalian species that {{is confined to}} a narrow region of southeastern China. Male black muntjacs have an astonishing X 1 X 2 Y 1 Y 2 Y 3 sex chromosome system, unparalleled in eutherian mammals, involving {{approximately half of the}} entire genome. A high-resolution comparative map between the <b>black</b> <b>muntjac</b> (M. crinifrons) and the Chinese muntjac (M. reevesi, 2 n =  46) has been constructed based on the chromosomal localization of 304 clones from a genomic BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) library of the Indian muntjac (M. muntjak vaginalis, 2 n =  6 ♀/ 7 ♂). In addition to validating the chromosomal homologies between M. reevesi and M. crinifrons defined previously by chromosome painting, the comparative BAC map demonstrates that all tandem fusions that have occurred in the karyotypic evolution of M. crinifrons are centromere–telomere fusions. The map also allows for a more detailed reconstruction of the chromosomal rearrangements leading to this unique and complex sex chromosome system. Furthermore, we have identified 46 BAC clones {{that could be used to}} study the molecular evolution of the unique sex chromosomes of the male black muntjacs...|$|E
