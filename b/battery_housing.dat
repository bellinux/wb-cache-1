50|$|The AN/PVS-4 uses a 25mm screw-type variable-gain Image Intensifier tube. Operational voltage is 3.0 Volts.

These battery compartments are designed to accommodate one 3.0V BA-5567/U, or two 1.5V BA-3058/U simultaneously.

5000|$|During the Crimean War, {{the fleet}} of the {{alliance}} opposing the Russian Empire used Fårösund as their Baltic Sea base. An artillery battery {{for the defense of}} {{the southern part of the}} inlet to Fårösund had been built in 1721, on the south shore opposite the Skarv shallows, and a blockhouse housing two 8 pounder cannons was constructed further out on the Bungenäs. After the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, these fortifications were abandoned. In 1818, Fårösund's importance as a Naval base was once again brought to light. In 1885, when it seemed like there could be a conflict between Russia and the UK, the area around the town was further fortified by placing a line of naval mines around the harbor. This escalation of the defense was made to indicate that Sweden was determined to maintain its neutrality. Therefore, a <b>battery</b> <b>housing</b> of seven 12 cm muzzle-loading guns was hastily built at the south end of the strait. Later, a similar but smaller battery was built at the north end and finally a third, for heavier artillery, southeast of the first battery. In 1900-02, the two first batteries were converted and updated with more modern armament. Since 1905, there was a coastal artillery detachment from Vaxholm Coastal Artillery Regiment (KA 1) stationed in Fårösund where barracks for the unit had been built in 1902-06.|$|E

40|$|The battery {{systems of}} {{electrified}} vehicles are characterised by increasing weight due to larger battery modules. A lightweight battery carrier structure {{can reduce the}} system weight by replacing heavy metallic housing components by materials like fibre-reinforced plastics (FRP) and aluminum. The <b>battery</b> <b>housing</b> has to meet several requirements, e. g. stiffness, crash and intrusion protection, proof of leakage and thermal management.

30|$|When someone joins large {{structural}} components, {{the importance}} of the joining technology increases. Well-known joining processes such as welding and classic adhesive bonding reach their limits with respect to cycle times and tolerances. A new two-component polyurethane injection process based on the reaction in mold technology, offers an alternative and has the potential to reduce costs and compensate tolerances. The objective {{of this paper is to}} characterize and evaluate this process for potential applications so that it is possible to set the parameters as necessary. The example that was chosen for this research is the <b>battery</b> <b>housing</b> for electric vehicles. The advantage that this process does not only join the parts within seconds, but also will seal or fill long gaps if necessary, makes it particularly interesting for the industry. Classic adhesive technology applies the adhesive on one part, then takes the second part for the joining process, grouts the adhesive to a defined gap and afterwards, it still has to cure in a geometrically-defined tool. The PUR injection process fixes the two components in a tool with a defined gap and afterwards, injects the PUR that then reacts in the gap and joins the two parts within seconds. The adhesion and as well the rheology decreases with an increase in crosslinkings. These two parameters are therefore described relative to time and temperature. A steep increase in viscosity is detected after just a few seconds. With higher adherend temperatures the increase in viscosity appears earlier and steeper. The property for adhesion to the surface is decreasing the longer the PUR takes to hit the surface. These dependencies are described in this paper to develop a reproducible application process with a <b>battery</b> <b>housing</b> for electric vehicles as a case study.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBattery packs for purely {{electrical}} driven vehicles {{should allow}} for a long driving range, therefore they must be as light as possible. The aim of the project “SmartBatt” – funded by the EC under the 7 th Framework Programme – {{was to create a}} 20 kWh battery pack which exhibits a 10 - 15 % weight reduction as compared to the State of the Art. This was accomplished by using innovative sandwich materials made of aluminum face sheets and a core of aluminum hybrid foam for the <b>battery</b> <b>housing.</b> Aluminum-epoxy hybrid foams can be obtained by first producing small aluminum foam granules. The foamed granules are then coated with an epoxy adhesive which contains a foaming agent. After filling a hollow structure with the coated aluminum foam spheres the foaming and curing of the adhesive coating is initiated by a mild heat treatment at temperatures between 100 and 200 °C. As a result a composite material is formed which consists of aluminum foam spheres embedded in a matrix of epoxy foam (hybrid foam). By placing and curing the coated granules between two face sheets aluminum hybrid foam sandwiches can be produced. The mechanical characteristics of the core layer material like compression strength and specific deformation energy absorption were determined using quasi-static and high strain rate compression tests. Relevant material properties and the overall achievements in this case study will be presented...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThermal {{management}} {{design for}} electric vehicles (EV) {{is very important}} in order to manage the thermal dissipated by operating components. This research aims at performing design optimization of a thermal management system for battery modules, controller and electric motor in EV. A combination of passive and active cooling systems is proposed where air cooled is used in battery modules, water cooling for controller and water jacket for electric motor. Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (DFMEA) method is deployed to identify the potential failure modes and causes so that improvements can be made for battery modules, controller and electric motor. The design for all of the components and the thermal management system were done with CATIA V 5. The material selections process for the designs was based on the analysis using Cambridge Engineering Selector (CES EduPack). Final design was utilizing water cooled for electric motor and controller while using air cooled for battery modules.
