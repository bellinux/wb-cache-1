5|$|Many {{people think}} of deserts as {{consisting}} of extensive areas of billowing sand dunes <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{the way they are}} often depicted on TV and in films, but deserts do not always look like this. Across the world, around 20% of desert is sand, varying from only 2% in North America to 30% in Australia and over 45% in Central Asia. Where sand does occur, it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes.|$|E
5|$|So {{direction}} 0 {{indicates the}} worm continues to travel straight ahead, direction 1 indicates the worm {{will make a}} right turn of 60° and similarly for the other directions. The worm cannot travel in direction 3 <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the gridline it has just traversed. Thus a worm with rule {1,0,5,1} decides to travel in direction 1 {{the first time it}} has to make a choice, in direction 0 the next time it has to make a choice and so on. If there is only one available gridline, the worm {{has no choice but to}} take it and this is usually not explicitly listed.|$|E

25|$|See The Encyclopedia of Railroads, O. S. Nock, 1977 The name is Walschaert, {{changed by}} the family in 1830 when Belgium became {{independent}} of the Netherlands. It was patented under the name Walschaert <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> how the name was spelled in 1844.|$|E

25|$|An echocardiogram, often {{referred}} to as a cardiac echo or simply an echo, is a sonogram of the heart. (It is not abbreviated as ECG, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> an abbreviation for an electrocardiogram.) Echocardiography uses standard two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and Doppler ultrasound to create images of the heart.|$|E
25|$|Albert, {{whom the}} novel {{identifies}} as Chris's guardian angel, explains that Summerland includes {{many things that}} inhabitants do not need — such as automobiles — but which exist simply because some people believe they are needed.

25|$|The MMR {{vaccine is}} {{administered}} by a subcutaneous injection.The second dose may be given as early as {{one month after the}} first dose. The second dose is a dose to produce immunity in the small number of persons (2–5%) who fail to develop measles immunity after the first dose.

25|$|In the Sumerian {{version of}} the flood myth, {{the causes of the}} flood and the reasons for the hero's {{survival}} are unknown {{due to the fact that}} the beginning of the tablet describing the story has been destroyed. Nonetheless, Samuel Noah Kramer has stated that it can probably be reasonably inferred that the hero Ziusudra survives due to Enki's aid <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what happens in the later Akkadian and Babylonian versions of the story.|$|E
25|$|Both sides claimed victory with {{roughly equal}} {{casualties}}Union casualties were 5,031 (790 killed, 3,594 wounded, 647 captured or missing), Confederate 6,134 (980 killed, 4,749 wounded, 405 captured or missing). McClellan's advance on Richmond was halted and the Army of Northern Virginia {{fell back into}} the Richmond defensive works. The battle was frequently remembered by the Union soldiers as the Battle of Fair Oaks Station <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> where they did their best fighting, whereas the Confederates, for the same reason, called it Seven Pines.|$|E
25|$|Next, {{the priest}} {{takes up the}} prosphoron of the Nine Ranks. From this loaf are taken smaller {{triangular}} particles in commemoration of the various ranks of saints. There are some differences between the Greek and the Slavic texts as to which particular saints are named, but the intent {{is that all of}} the saints are included. Saint John the Forerunner and the Patron Saint of the church or monastery are always named. The number nine was chosen <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the traditional number of the ranks of angels.|$|E

25|$|Most floats are {{shades of}} green <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the color of glass from {{recycled}} sake bottles (especially after long exposure to sunlight). However, clear, amber, aquamarine, amethyst, blue and other colors were also produced. The most prized and rare color is a red or cranberry hue. These were expensive to make because gold was used to produce the color. Other brilliant tones such as emerald green, cobalt blue, purple, yellow and orange were primarily made in the 1920s and 30s. The majority of the colored floats available for sale today are replicas.|$|E
25|$|Quite often, {{textbook}} {{problems will}} treat the population standard deviation {{as if it}} were known and thereby avoid the need to use the Student's t-distribution. These problems are generally of two kinds: (1) those in which the sample size is so large that one may treat a data-based estimate of the variance {{as if it were}} certain, and (2) those that illustrate mathematical reasoning, in which the problem of estimating the standard deviation is temporarily ignored <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not the point that the author or instructor is then explaining.|$|E
25|$|Humans are {{the main}} {{reservoir}} for T. b. gambiense but this species {{can also be found}} in pigs and other animals. Wild game animals and cattle {{are the main}} reservoir of T. b. rhodesiense. These parasites primarily infect individuals in sub-Saharan Africa <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> where the vector (tsetse fly) is located. The two human forms of the disease also vary greatly in intensity. T. b. gambiense causes a chronic condition that can remain in a passive phase for months or years before symptoms emerge and the infection can last about 3 years before death occurs.|$|E

25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E
25|$|In the Canadian {{province}} of New Brunswick, collisions with moose are frequent enough that all new highways have fences to prevent moose from accessing the road, as {{has long been}} done in Finland, Norway, and Sweden. A demonstration project, Highway7 between Fredericton and Saint John, which {{has one of the}} highest frequencies of moose collisions in the province, did not have these fences until 2008, although it was and continues to be extremely well signed. Newfoundland and Labrador recommended that motorists use caution between dusk and dawn <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> when moose are most active and most difficult to see, increasing the risk of collisions. Local moose sightings are often reported on radio stations so that motorists can take care while driving in particular areas.|$|E
25|$|This high Mass is the norm; {{it is only}} in the {{complete}} rite with deacon and subdeacon that the ceremonies can be understood. Thus, the rubrics of the Ordinary of the Mass always suppose that the Mass is high. Low Mass, said by a priest alone with one server, is a shortened and simplified form of the same thing. Its ritual can be explained only by a reference to high Mass. For instance, the celebrant goes over to the north side of the altar to read the Gospel, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the side to which the deacon goes in procession at high Mass; he turns round always by the right, because at high Mass he should not turn his back to the deacon and so on.|$|E
