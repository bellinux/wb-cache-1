5000|$|The tour used seven {{individual}} rigs for {{performers and}} props to become airborne. For dancers to be flown {{to the center}} of each upstage, a wench, which dropped 18 inches {{off the face of the}} panel, was placed in the rig. Cyrus' flying required two wenches, one for a vertical lift and one for a horizontal move that coursed the audience and back to the stage. Four elevators, or trap doors, were located throughout the stage, some of which had the option of a 4×4 or an 8×8 foot opening. All of the fly rigs and elevators were built and operated by Show Group Production Services (SGPS)/Showrig. The challenge that presented the most difficulty for SGPS was time constraint, as there were only three weeks of rehearsal. Brian White, co-owner of SGPS, explained, There wasn’t a lot of time, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> was that it was at the L.A. Forum, which gave us a lot of height to fly things around, and there was also a lot of room to lay stuff out on the floor. <b>The</b> other <b>good</b> thing was that our offices are only 10 minutes away. So if I had to send a welder down there to make some changes I could do it pretty fast. The biggest thing we had going for us was a great crew. We had some really good people out there." ... I’d say that about 90 percent of what we built on Miley Cyrus fit the first time in rehearsal. The only reason we had to retro fit anything was because of last minute design changes that came about once everything was up and they could see it all.|$|R
40|$|Is {{it always}} wise to boast about <b>good</b> <b>news?</b> When {{messages}} are verifiable, the standard result from disclosure games is that <b>good</b> <b>news</b> should be disclosed or the receiver will infer that the sender has nothing favorable to report. We reconsider this conclusion when the receiver has private information about sender type. Because better senders expect {{the receiver to}} have more favorable private information about them, {{we find that the}} worst sender type with <b>good</b> <b>news</b> has <b>the</b> most incentive to disclose it. Therefore reporting <b>good</b> <b>news</b> can paradoxically make an unfavorable impression. If <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> is sufficiently rare a unique disclosure equilibrium exists in which <b>good</b> <b>news</b> is disclosed. <b>But</b> if <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> is attainable even by mediocre types then two understatement equilibria always exist: a nondisclosure equilibrium in which all types withhold <b>good</b> <b>news</b> and a countersignaling equilibrium in which mediocre types report <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> best types withhold it. When such equilibria exist, the sender has a legitimate fear of looking overly eager to reveal <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> Having a third party disclose the news, or mandating that the sender disclose the news, eliminates this problem...|$|R

The Varied Voices tour played in eight cities and featured Tillery, Mary Watkins, Gwen Avery, Vicki Randle, and poet Pat Parker and brought poetry as well as jazz and blues to women's music audiences. It also exposed audience members to an empowering lesbian culture that was emerging across the USA and it [...] "demonstrated that white lesbians were not the only ones creating a new women's culture: Though the concert tour was first and foremost a celebration of Black lesbian feminist identity and culture, it was also an attempt to broaden the white feminist community's understanding of feminist and lesbian identity…. Varied Voices was a watershed event in the history of black women and women-identified music". The film Radical Harmonies documents the history of women's music, and includes a segment on the Varied Voices tour.

Too often Twista is dragged down by the performances of his superfluous guests, or an overall misguided push for imaginative ventures.

For it is through the women, through them mainly, if not altogether, that civilization and religion can be introduced among any degraded class. It was so in the Middle Age.
