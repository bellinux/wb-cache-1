25|$|The {{image to}} the right shows a simple {{sequential}} game that illustrates the issue with subgame imperfect Nash equilibria. In this game player one chooses left(L) or right(R), which is followed by player two being called upon to <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> (K) or unkind (U) to player one, However, player two only stands to gain from being unkind if player one goes left. If player one goes right the rational player two would de facto <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> to him in that subgame. However, The non-credible threat of being unkind at 2(2) is still part of the blue (L, (U,U)) Nash equilibrium. Therefore, if rational behavior can be expected by both parties the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium {{may be a more}} meaningful solution concept when such dynamic inconsistencies arise.|$|E
