40|$|This thesis for {{bachelor}} degree {{focuses on a}} comparison of pick-up round balers, one with a variable bale chamber (baler John Deere 580 with cutting) and one with a constant bale chamber (baler Krone Rond Pack 1250 MultiCut). The two balers were compared in respect {{to the quality of}} cutting, bale density and haylage quality. Other compared parameters included <b>capacity,</b> costs of <b>baling,</b> packaging, loading and transport of baled fodder, analysis of costs per 1 kg of fodder and simple analyses of investment and operating costs. The quality of haylage was better for the JD 580 baler and it was classified as excellent. The baler Round Pack 1250 produced better values of bale density: 221. 09 kg. m- 3 for hay, 428. 57 kg. m- 3 for haylage and 173. 46 kg. m- 3 for straw. Hourly <b>baling</b> <b>capacities</b> were 8. 12 t. h- 1 for hay and 11. 55 t. h- 1 for haylage. The baling costs were 104. 2 CZK. t- 1 for haylage and 210. 36 CZK. t- 1 for hay. The costs per 1 hectare were 376. 6 CZK and the costs per 1 kg of haylage and hay were 0. 539 CZK. kg- 1 and 0. 606 CZK. kg- 1 respectively...|$|R

40|$|This Diploma Theses {{focuses on}} the {{assessment}} of two pick-up balers which compress crop into compact bales. The balers are made and delivered by different manufacturers with a variable bale chamber and cutting mode {{at the moment of}} haylage, hay and straw harvesting. Specifically, the given assessment compared John Deere 960 Baler and Kuhn VB 2160 Baler while considering the following parameters: quality of cutting, <b>bale</b> density, haylage, <b>capacity</b> and performance, economic analysis and recommendation for their use in agriculture. John Deere 960 Baler achieved better results in the majority of performed tests. The values of bale density were the following: 666. 25 kg. m- 3 (haylage), 221. 39 kg. m- 3 (hay), 176. 62 kg. m- 3 (straw). The assessment of haylage quality was excellent. The given baler (JD 960) also excelled at harvesting capacities: 20. 89 t. h- 1 (haylage), 15. 61 t. h- 1 (hay) and 12. 54 t. h- 1 (straw). Baling costs per 1 kilogram of forage revealed the following figures: 0. 036 CZK (haylage), 0. 079 CZK (hay) and 0. 101 CZK (straw). Costs assessment for practical use of both balers per operating year indicates that the JD 960 Baler´s use is more cost effective by 1, 320 CZK per 100 hectares (haylage), by 2, 690 CZK (hay) and by 6, 000 CZK (straw) in comparison with Kuhn VB 2160 Baler. As a consequence, the use and operation of John Deere 960 Baler can be recommended to large-sized companies with a sufficient amount of financial resources which can be invested in purchase of the given machinery. The baler is suitable for large areas with the demanding seasonal harvesting. On the other hand, Kuhn VB 2160 Baler did not show such an impressive result as JD 960 Baler. However, its use and operation is recommended to small or medium-sized agricultural companies which can appreciate the baler´s performance especially during hay and straw harvesting...|$|R

5000|$|Natchez VII {{was built}} in 1869. It was 301 ft long, had eight boilers and a 5,500 cotton <b>bale</b> <b>capacity.</b> In its -year service, it made 401 trips without a single deadly accident. It became famous as the {{participant}} against another Mississippi paddle steamer, the Robert E. Lee, in a race from New Orleans to St. Louis in June 1870, immortalized in a lithograph by Currier and Ives. This Natchez had beaten the previous speed record, that of the J. M. White in 1844. Stripped down, carrying no cargo, steaming on through fog and making only one stop, the Robert E. Lee won the race in 3 days, 8 hours and 14 minutes. By contrast, the Natchez carried her normal load and stopped as normal, tying up overnight when fog was encountered. Despite this she berthed only six hours later. One way Leathers tried to speed up his boat was giving all of his workers whiskey. When Leathers finally dismantled the boat in Cincinnati in 1879, this particular Natchez had never flown the American flag ...|$|E
