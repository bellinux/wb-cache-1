5|$|In 1886, Johann Gottfried Spiesshofer and Michael Braun {{founded a}} factory for the {{production}} of corsets in Heubach (Baden-Wurttemberg). They first employed six people on the same number of sewing machines. That number rose to 150 people in 1890, and in 1894 their first exports were sent abroad, to England. It was only in 1902 that Spieshofer and Braun registered the Triumph brand, which was reminiscent of the Parisian Arc de Triomphe, to which International was later added. After the economic boom in the 1920s, demand for the classic corset declined, which is why the company began parallel production of <b>brassieres.</b> In the 1930s, Triumph International also began producing corselets.|$|E

25|$|Manufacturers' {{marketing}} and advertising often appeals to fashion and image over fit, comfort, and function. Since about 1994, manufacturers have re-focused their advertising, moving from advertising functional <b>brassieres</b> that emphasize support and foundation, to selling lingerie that emphasize fashion while sacrificing basic fit and function, like linings under scratchy lace.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There {{are very}} few reports in regard to {{relationship}} between breast size and shoulder-neck pain. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the correlations among breast size, <b>brassiere</b> cup size, and moment-in-time reporting of shoulderneck pain in a group of adult women. Three hundred thirty nine female volunteers from the hospital staff answered the questionnaire. Breast size, <b>brassiere</b> cup size, and shoulder-neck pain were self-reported by each participant. The relationship among breast size, <b>brassiere</b> cup size and shoulder-neck pain was investigated. Spearman’s test showed no significant relationship between shoulder-neck pain and <b>brassiere</b> cup size. However, after participants were classified into two groups (small <b>brassiere</b> cup size and large <b>brassiere</b> cup size with 219 and 120 participants, respectively), there was a significant positive correlation between shoulder-neck pain and large <b>brassiere</b> cup size (p< 0. 05). There was no significant relationship between shoulder-neck pain and breast size. In conclusion, large <b>brassiere</b> cup size is an important cause of shoulder-neck pain...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1970s, Newmar {{received}} two U.S. patents for pantyhose {{and one for}} a <b>brassiere.</b> The pantyhose were described as having [...] "cheeky derriere relief" [...] and promoted under the name [...] "Nudemar". The <b>brassiere</b> was described as [...] "nearly invisible" [...] and {{in the style of}} Marilyn Monroe.|$|R
25|$|The corset {{fell from}} fashion in the 1920s in Europe and North America, {{replaced}} by girdles and elastic <b>brassieres,</b> but survived as {{an article of}} costume. Originally an item of lingerie, the corset has become a popular item of outerwear in the fetish, BDSM and goth subcultures. In the fetish and BDSM literature, there is often much emphasis on tightlacing, and many corset makers cater to the fetish market.|$|E
25|$|As the corset became shorter {{during the}} later 1910s, it {{provided}} less {{support to the}} bust. By 1920 the corset started at the waist, and bust containment yielded entirely to the bra. A low, sloping bustline became more fashionable. <b>Brassieres</b> from the late 1910s and early 1920s were merely slightly shaped bandeaus (bandeaux) style, holding the bust in and down {{by means of a}} clip attached to the corset.|$|E
25|$|Men {{are said}} to have worn loincloths in ancient Greece and Rome, though it is unclear whether Greek women wore undergarments. There is some {{speculation}} that only slaves wore loincloths and that citizens did not wear undergarments beneath their chitons. Mosaics of the Roman period indicate that women (primarily in an athletic context, whilst wearing nothing else) sometimes wore strophiae (breastcloths) or <b>brassieres</b> made of soft leather, along with subligacula which were either in the form of shorts or loincloths. Subligacula were also worn by men.|$|E
500|$|An underwire bra (also under wire bra, under-wire bra, or underwired bra) is a <b>brassiere</b> that {{utilizes}} a thin, semi-circular {{strip of}} rigid material fitted inside the <b>brassiere</b> fabric. The wire {{may be made}} of metal, plastic, or resin. It is sewn into the bra fabric and under each cup, from the center gore to under the wearer's armpit. The wire helps to lift, separate, shape, and support a woman's breasts. Many different <b>brassiere</b> designs incorporate an underwire, including shelf bras, demi bras, nursing bras, and bras built into other articles of clothing, such as [...] tank tops, dresses and swimsuits.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to {{her career as a}} couturière, costumier, journalist, and pundit, Lucy Duff-Gordon took significant advantage of opportunities for commercial endorsement, lending her name to advertising for <b>brassieres,</b> perfume, shoes, and other luxury apparel and beauty items. Among the most adventurous of her licensing ventures were a two-season, lower-priced, mail-order fashion line for Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1916–17), which promoted her clothing in special de luxe catalogues, and a contract to design interiors for limousines and town cars for the Chalmers Motor Co., later Chrysler Corporation (1917).|$|E
25|$|Modern bikinis {{were first}} made of cotton and jersey. Today bikinis {{are made with}} mostly made with treated fabric, having been {{stretched}} over a plastic mold, then baked in order to set its shape and create bikini <b>brassieres.</b> They are usually lined with fabric {{which is designed to}} stop them becoming transparent when wet. The use of cotton made the swimsuit more practical, and the increased reliance on stretch fabric after 1960 simplified construction; alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, a New York socialite named Mary Phelps Jacob {{created the}} first modern {{brassiere}} by tying two handkerchiefs together with ribbon. Jacob's original intention was to cover the whalebone sticking out of her corset, which was visible through her sheer dress. Jacob began making <b>brassieres</b> for her family and friends, and news of the garment soon spread by word of mouth. By 1914, Jacob had a patent for her design and was marketing it throughout the US. Although women had worn brassiere-like garments in years past, Jacob's {{was the first to}} be successfully marketed and widely adopted.|$|E
50|$|An urban legend {{that the}} <b>brassiere</b> {{was invented by}} a man named Otto Titzling ("tit sling") who lost a lawsuit with Phillip de <b>Brassiere</b> ("fill up the brassiere") {{originated}} with the 1971 book Bust-Up: The Uplifting Tale of Otto Titzling and the Development of the Bra and was propagated in a comedic song from the movie Beaches.|$|R

25|$|Underwear is worn for {{a variety}} of reasons. They keep outer {{garments}} from being soiled by perspiration, urine, semen, menstrual blood and feces. Women's <b>brassieres</b> provide support for the breasts, and men's briefs serve the same function for the male genitalia. A corset may be worn as a foundation garment to alter a woman's body shape. For additional support and protection when playing sports, men often wear more tightly fitting underwear, including jockstraps and jockstraps with cup pocket and protective cup. Women may wear sports bras which provide greater support, thus increasing comfort and reducing the chance of damage to the ligaments of the chest during high-impact exercises such as jogging.|$|E
25|$|From 1870 to 1910, Bridgeport {{became the}} major {{industrial}} center of Connecticut and its population rose from around 25,000 to over 100,000, including thousands of Irish, Slovaks, Hungarians, Germans, English, and Italian immigrants. A Singer factory joined Wheeler & Wilson in producing sewing machines and the Locomobile Company of America {{was a prominent}} early automobile manufacturer, producing a prototype of the Stanley Steamer and various luxury cars. The town {{was the center of}} America's corset production, responsible for almost 20% of the national total, and became the headquarters of Remington Arms following its 1912 merger with the Union Metallic Cartridge Co. Around the time of the First World War, Bridgeport was also producing steam-fitting and heating apparatuses, brass goods, phonographs, typewriters, milling machines, <b>brassieres,</b> and saddles.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} {{scars of}} a breast augmentation mammoplasty develop approximately at 6-weeks post-operative, and fade within months. Depending upon the daily-life physical activities required of the woman, the breast augmentation patient usually resumes her normal life at 1-week post-operative. Moreover, women whose breast implants were emplaced beneath the chest muscles (submuscular placement) {{usually have a}} longer, slightly more painful convalescence, because of the healing of the incisions to the chest muscles. Usually, she does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for approximately 6 weeks. During the initial post-operative recovery, the woman is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arm to alleviate pain and discomfort; if required, analgesic indwelling medication catheters can alleviate pain Moreover, significantly improved patient recovery has resulted from refined breast-device implantation techniques (submuscular, subglandular) that allow 95 per cent of women to resume their normal lives at 24-hours post-procedure, without bandages, fluid drains, pain pumps, catheters, medical support <b>brassières,</b> or narcotic pain medication.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] This study {{examined}} the effect of wearing a <b>brassiere</b> on upper trapezius (UT) region pain and EMG activity during arm elevation by women. [Subjects and Methods] Fourteen healthy women were recruited. Surface EMG {{data were collected from}} the UT muscles during arm elevation. Pressure pain in the UT region was measured using a baseline dolorimeter. [Results] The EMG activity of the UT increased significantly when a bras-siere was worn compared to without. UT region pain showed no significant difference between with and without wearing a <b>brassiere.</b> [Conclusion] This suggests that wearing a <b>brassiere</b> increases the muscle activation of the UT in women...|$|R

500|$|Beginning in 1967, the {{advertising}} focused exclusively on Wonderbra brand <b>brassieres.</b> In 1968, Nadler hired Goodis Advertising {{to develop the}} new campaign. The Wonderbra ads were based on fashion and emotional appeal. In various ads, the man would appear as fashion photographer (in a fashion shoot) or fashion buyer (at a fashion show). The storyline suggested an attraction or budding romance between {{the man and the}} women. The voice-over and jingle featured a man's voice and the commercial showed an actual woman's torso naked except for a bra. All other television ads before this era showed <b>brassieres</b> on a manikin or a dressmaker's dummy to promote the functional features of the product. Every Wonderbra advertisement contained versions of the musical theme, [...] "We care about the shape you're in. Wonderful, wonderful, Wonderbra". The 1979 television campaign included a commercial directed by Richard Avedon which won a Silver award for television advertisements shown in Canada.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of being}} hidden [...] "unmentionables", Wonderbras became more visible icons of female sex-appeal. The company also used pricing to promote Wonderbra as a luxury product {{with the highest}} price of any mass-merchandised brand. This {{strategy}} also provided greater profits in a very competitive industry. The goal was to have women see their Wonderbras as a cosmetic—a beauty enhancer—rather than a functional garment. Playtex, the leading brand at the time, promoted the ease of care and durability of their girdles and <b>brassieres.</b>|$|E

500|$|Later, Larry Nadler {{identified}} an age based bifurcation in the market. Younger women (aged 15 to 20) regarded their bras as an enhancement {{to their}} sexuality {{but were not}} interested in a heavily structured garment. Nadler learned that women wanted [...] "less bra," [...] not [...] "no bra." [...] In 1974, they introduced a new line of <b>brassieres</b> for teens called Dici (by Wonderbra), and invented new hot fabric molding technologies to shape the cup. These bras were seamless and simply designed with less support than the typical bra of the period. The company designed special packaging {{in the shape of a}} die (with holes).|$|E
500|$|From 1939 to 1955, Canadian Lady marketed several {{lines of}} {{intimate}} apparel including girdles, panties, slips, swimsuits, and <b>brassieres</b> under the Wonderbra brand. The Company also created sub-brands to target different socioeconomic and lifestyle {{segments of the}} consumer market. In contrast, the U.S. market for Wonder-Bra stagnated while the brand was owned by Israel Pilot's companies. In 1952, Canadian Lady launched Petal Burst with anticipation of tough negotiations with D'Amour—Israel Pilot's U.S. company—around the expiration of the patent in 1955. This new line also adapted to a new fashion trend towards a pointed bust, inspired by Christian Dior's [...] "New Look". The Petal Burst by Wonderbra line was successful and delivered 50% of bra sales by 1957.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} existing {{evidence for}} the association between different type of <b>brassiere</b> exposures {{and the risk of}} breast cancer. METHODS: Ovid Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Data Base of Systematic Reviews, Pubmed, Scopus, Proquest, Sciencedirect, Wiley Online Library, WanF ang Data, Hong Kong Index to Chinese Periodicals,China Journal Net,Chinese Medical Current Contents, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China Academic Journals FullText database, Taiwan Electronic Periodical Services and HyR ead; reference lists of published studies; original research studies published in English or Chinese examining the association between type and duration of brassiere-wearing and breast cancer risk. Data were abstracted by a first reviewer and verified by a second. Study quality was rated according to predefined criteria. "Fair" or "good" quality studies were included. Results were summarised by meta-analysis whenever adequate material was available. RESULTS:Twelve case-control studies were included in the review. Meta-analysis showed <b>brassiere</b> wearing during sleep was associated with a 1. 3 times of increased risk. The odd ratio for more than 12 h of daily <b>brassiere</b> use in relation to breast cancer risk was 1. 08 (95 %CI: 1. 01 - 1. 14).
