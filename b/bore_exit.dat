Hence, to distinguish between [...] "Full" [...] vs. even tighter chokes, such as [...] "Turkey", it becomes necessary to measure the <b>bore</b> <b>exit</b> diameter of the choke tube to determine precisely which choke type is present among the [...] "Full" [...] and tighter (smaller diameter) chokes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDrilling {{of highly}} {{abrasive}} carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) requires carbide tools with geometrical highly adaptable tool geometries and wear resistant diamond coatings. To counteract the tradeoff between long tool lifetime by preferably thick diamond layers leading to large cutting edge radii (bluntness), and the sharpest possible cutting edge to generate flawless machining qualities, the following post-coating cutting edge treatment methods are compared: Laser-ablation and selective sandblasting. It is shown that laser treatment generates cutting edge radii of 3 - 4 μm leading to outstanding <b>bore</b> <b>exit</b> qualities in CFRP {{from the first}} bore on, while diamond still protects the rake face...|$|E
40|$|The electrogun metal vapor plasma {{discharge}} {{is a new}} high-power pulsed device for producing vapors of different metals. The process employs electrode erosion to vaporize one of the discharge electrodes. The eroded metal vapor is subsequently ionized to form a dense plasma in which a high current discharge is sustained. The vapor plasma then exits the discharge {{where it can be}} used in the synthesis of novel materials or as an ignitor for electrothermal – chemical guns. A model for the electrogun discharge bore plasma ow, bore wall erosion, and simpli ed models for the cathode and anode regions are presented in this paper. The bore plasma ows under local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions and is weakly nonideal. Two electrogun shots involving different cathode materials (aluminum and titanium) are sim-ulated. Results reveal the physics underlying the operation of the electrogun discharge. High pressures of the bore plasma result in thermal choking at <b>bore</b> <b>exit.</b> Cathode material erosion dominates over the bore wall erosion, thus ensuring a relatively pure metal vapor yield. The exit parameters of the electrogun are predicted and can be used as input boundary conditions for analysis of the external plasma jet ow...|$|E
50|$|The adult moth only {{lives for}} two months: July and August. Mating {{takes place at}} night in early August after which the female lays a cluster of about 80-130 eggs near {{the base of a}} bamboo shoot. The larvae hatch after 12 days, and are pale brown in colour and covered with long hair. Working together, the larvae bore an {{entrance}} hole at an internode of the bamboo in one day. After entering the shoot, they then, also in one day, <b>bore</b> an <b>exit</b> hole for the mature moths from which to eventually emerge. The larvae turn white within three days.|$|R
40|$|Today, {{one million}} people are {{drinking}} unhealthy water in the world. Each year 5 million people worldwide die due to the diseases caused by unhealthy drinking water. Unhealthy water creates a great risk, especially for children because of their undeveloped immune system (G 8 Action Plan Decisions, 2003) 1. Indeed, the World Health Organization estimates that 4. 1 million children die from diarrhea, which can be inhibited by healthy water (WHO, 2010) 2. In developed countries, {{it is observed that}} water is not only a basic consumption food, but also a lifestyle product. As mentioned in the Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, packaged water consumption reflects the choices related to the lifestyle as well as being a basic need {{at the bottom of the}} pyramid (Sipos, et al., 2007) 3. Water is increasingly becoming an important economic resource, and its public distribution is being privatized in many countries (e. g., France, England, Brazil, Australia, Bolivia and, recently proposed in Italy), opening new market opportunities for private investors. The consumption of bottled mineral water is significantly increasing worldwide and has become an important factor both for economic and health issues (King, 2008) 4. Natural mineral water means microbiologically wholesome water, originating in an underground water table or deposit and emerging from a spring tapped at one or more natural or <b>bore</b> <b>exits.</b> This type of water cannot be sterilized, pasteurized or otherwise treated to remove or destroy microorganisms (European Commission, 2009) 5. Hence, the researcher has made an attempt to find out the existing awareness and attitudes of consumers towards using packaged drinking water in Thoothukudi District...|$|R
50|$|Flora is a three-bore {{station with}} a short, 33 meter middle tunnel, 6 pairs of {{boarding}} zones and prefabricated, cast-iron panels {{on the station}} walls. It is 108 meters long and only 26 meters deep, {{making it one of}} the shallowest stations on the entire line. From the middle <b>bore,</b> an <b>exit</b> escalator goes through a tunnel to an underground vestibule (4.75 meters underground), which is attached to the shopping mall Palác Flora (2003). One can access Palác Flora by going through the immediate right exit after going up the escalator. There are six more exits from the vestibule to the street. The station is covered in gold and wine-colored die-cast aluminum panels, and also with decorative gray stone. Construction of the station cost 254 million Czechoslovak crowns.|$|R
5000|$|The Pastoral pipe had {{a narrow}} throat bore of 3.5 - 4 mm and an <b>exit</b> <b>bore</b> seldom larger than 11mm. Its bore {{was very similar}} to later flat set Union pipe chanter bores made in the early 18th century. The reeds had a head width of 9.5mm to 10.5mm and staple bores of 3.6mm. The chanters were made {{in a variety of}} pitches with a quiet tone and an E flat pitch being very common among {{surviving}} instruments. [...] Later examples include a slide on the foot joint to change the lower leading note from flat to sharp as required and on a further set an on/off mechanism is fitted to control the drones with the two regulators fitted neatly {{to the top of the}} common stock and the addition of key in [...] "e" [...] to increase the compass of the chanter in the second octave.|$|R
40|$|A {{continuously}} flowing (CH₃) ₂CHN beam {{is generated}} by pyrolysis of (CH₃) ₂CHN₃at 113 (± 0. 5) °C using normal inlet system with an 8 mm <b>bore</b> of the <b>exit</b> of the quartz tube under the presence of molecular sieve (30 Å) and stabilizing NO gas, and its HeI photoelectron (PE) spectrum is also recorded in situ. A spectrum recorded further away from the pyrolysis catalyst or by using a 0. 4 mm bore of the quartz tube is the PE spectrum of (CH₃) ₂=NH, which comes from the isomerization of (CH₃) ₂CHN. The ionization energies of (CH₃) ₂CHN and (CH₃) ₂C=NH are determined {{for the first time}} by the photoelectron spectroscopy experiment, and Gaussian 2 and improved density functional theory calculations. Experimental and theoretical results agree reasonably well, and show that (CH₃) ₂CHN is a diradical with C[sub s] symmetry and has a³A" ground state, and (CH₃) ₂C=NH is a closed shell molecule with C[sub s] symmetry.

40|$|Restoring {{deadwood}} {{habitat is}} vital {{in order to}} recreate fully functioning forest ecosystems. Letting this process occur naturally can take in excess of one hundred years, thus management practises typically try to accelerate this via the artificial addition of deadwood. Since the species which rely on deadwood often have poor dispersal abilities, restoring deadwood habitat rarely results in the full restoration of the sa- proxylic fauna. Furthermore, standard deadwood monitoring protocol only records the amount and type of substrate available and is not capable of determining whether saproxylic insects have been restored. Full species inventories are time-consuming, costly and require great expertise. We present a rapid biodiversi- ty assessment tool which we believe is the first protocol for measuring saproxylic activity which is ac- cessible to non-specialists. Utilising the <b>exit</b> <b>bore</b> holes which saproxylics create on deadwood can pro- vide {{an indication of the}} density, richness and diversity of species present; we call this the Saproxylic Ac- tivity Index. We show that this index can detect differences in the activity of insects between substrates. As saproxylic insects provide important ecosystem functions, such as aiding in the decay of deadwood and recycling nutrients, a measure of their activity levels may indicate the rate of restoration of these ecosystem processes. We believe that further exploration of this method provides an exciting opportunity for the functional restoration of saproxylic fauna to become incorporated into mainstream forest management...|$|R
50|$|Here, it is {{important}} to note that Formula SAE was NOT a simple renaming of the Mini-Indy competition but was instead an entirely new intercollegiate student engineering design competition. Unlike all previous SAE-sanctioned student racing/design competitions including Mini-Indy, the Formula SAE rules left the selection of the engine to the design team, as long as a 4 stroke engine with a one-inch diameter intake restrictor was used. (The current Formula SAE rules allow the teams to use 4-stroke engines up to 675 cc, with a smaller restrictor.) Also, unlike all previous SAE-sanctioned student racing/design competitions including Mini-Indy, engine modifications were both allowed and encouraged. The first Formula SAE competition was held in the parking lot of the UT baseball field (Disch-Falk field) on the University of Texas campus on Memorial Day weekend, 1981. Judges included legendary race car engineer/owner/driver and Indy 500 champion Jim Hall. While a sudden Texas rain storm sent everyone scrambling for cover just before the endurance event that day, the weather failed to dampen the spirits of the students, judges, or spectators and Formula SAE was born. The University of Texas continued to host the event from 1982 to 1984 as the popularity and number of participants grew. In these subsequent years, UT moved the Formula SAE competition to other parking areas that included elevation changes and driveway aprons that forced the use of functioning suspensions. The event became international in 1982 with the entry of Universidad La Salle team from Mexico City. The significant rules changes for 1982 were: 1) a displacement limit of 600 cc (300 cc for Wankels), but the 1 inch diameter restrictor rule was retained, 2) a requirement for 4-wheel independent suspension (Mini-Indy did not have any suspension rules), and 3) the addition of a temporary “B&S” class of vehicles that were originally designed for Mini-Baja, had to retain the 8 hp Briggs & Stratton engine, and did not need to comply with the 4-wheel independent suspension rule. Formula SAE continued to be an international competition when the team from Universidad La Salle returned. With the only engine restrictions being a displacement limit of 600 cc and a 1 inch maximum diameter for the intake, creativity flourished. Also in 1983, the temporary B&S class was eliminated, the University of Texas at Austin entered the first composite Formula SAE vehicle and Marquette University entered the first turbocharged engine. The rules allowed a Formula SAE car to compete for two years in recognition of the effort required to build and test a quality car. This also allowed students the experience of re-engineering and improving on design elements that did not work. The rules for 1984 specifically allowed turbochargers, superchargers, and use of nitrous oxide but the engine had to breathe through a 25.4 mm <b>exit</b> <b>bore</b> of the carburetor casting (1984 was well before electronic fuel injection). Engine intake restrictors were later tightened as cars became faster year over year as knowledge was passed on within and between teams. Also, a 65-100 inch wheelbase rule was promulgated, as was a rule requiring all vehicles to have a “body that resembles a formula car”. The Formula SAE field had grown to eleven cars in 1984, so the University of Texas at Austin decided that the competition had matured sufficiently that it was safe to pass it on to other hosts.|$|R
