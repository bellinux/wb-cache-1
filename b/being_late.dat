5|$|Brian ends up exercising {{for hours}} {{with the help}} of Stewie, parodying Rocky Balboa in the movie Rocky IV, but realizes his test is only a few hours away. He becomes {{stressed}} at <b>being</b> <b>late</b> for his exam, so Lois persuades Peter to revive The A-Team one last time and drive Brian to his test, which is successful, and Brian arrives on time. He fails his test, but remains proud of himself for not cheating, much to the dismay of the family, who tells him that he probably should have cheated. Brian tries to reassure them that he finished what he started and labels his pride of that 'something', but the Griffins shoot him down for that.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} episode, Big Boo and Doggett's {{friendship}} continues to develop. Seeing that Doggett bears strong {{feelings of guilt}} relating to the six abortions that she has had, Big Boo makes reference to the book Freakonomics, which suggests that crime rates in the 1990s fell because of Roe v. Wade. Following Lorna Morello (played by Yael Stone) being relieved of her duty of driving the prison van, the role is given to Doggett. She comes into contact {{with one of the}} new correctional officers called Charlie Coates (played by James McMenamin). Coates is initially friendly towards Doggett. Despite relationships between prison staff and prisoners being forbidden, Coates kisses Doggett, against her will, after feeding some ducks. Following another outing, Coates gets in trouble with his boss Joe Caputo (played by Nick Sandow) for <b>being</b> <b>late</b> for count and is placed on probation. Doggett apologises for having caused him trouble, and he rapes her {{in the back of the}} prison van.|$|E

25|$|The Eagle {{was never}} fitted to a {{production}} front-line fighter, {{as it was}} overshadowed by {{a new wave of}} turbojet engines, such as the Rolls-Royce Derwent and turboprops such as the Dart and Armstrong Siddeley Python. Fifteen Eagle 22s were produced to power prototypes of the Westland Wyvern fighter/torpedo bomber due to its intended powerplant, the AS Python <b>being</b> <b>late</b> in development.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Masson began {{studying}} {{to become a}} psychoanalyst at the Toronto Psychoanalytic Institute, completing a full clinical training course in 1978. His training analyst was Irvine Schiffer, a well-known Toronto analyst and author of books on the unconscious aspects of charisma and time. In 1990 Masson published an autobiographical book in which he accused Schiffer of cursing and <b>being</b> <b>late</b> for sessions. Schiffer denied it and debated Masson on the Canadian television program The Fifth Estate.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the triumph}} of Calvinist forces {{in the south and}} {{lowlands}} of Scotland, many Scottish Highland clans remained either Catholic or Episcopalian in sympathy. The Catholic Clan MacDonald was subject to the Glencoe Massacre for <b>being</b> <b>late</b> in pledging loyalty to the Protestant King William III in 1691. And Highland clans rallied to the support of Catholic claimants to the British throne in the failed Jacobite Risings of the erstwhile Stuart King James III in 1715 and Charles Edward Stuart in 1745.|$|E
25|$|On 17 August 2015, SCDF {{serviceman}} Pte Shek Salmin Bin Murad {{committed suicide}} at around 1am {{because of an}} alleged abuse of authority by his superior, and problems he was facing at home. Shek alleged that he was given four days’ detention for being late; and {{a week or two}} after he was released from detention, he was charged for <b>being</b> <b>late</b> again, and was supposed to get charged on Monday 17 August, the date that he committed suicide.

25|$|Another easy-to-spot {{variable}} is the bright R Lyrae, {{north of the}} main asterism. Also known as 13 Lyrae, it is a 4th-magnitude red giant semiregular variable that varies by several tenths of a magnitude. Its periodicity is complex, with several different periods of varying lengths, most notably one of 46 days and one of 64 days. Even further north is FL Lyrae, a much fainter 9th-magnitude Algol variable that drops by half a magnitude every 2.18 days during the primary eclipse. Both components are main-sequence stars, the primary <b>being</b> <b>late</b> F-type and the secondary late G-type. The system {{was one of the}} first main-sequence eclipsing binaries containing G-type star to have its properties known as well as the better-studied early-type eclipsing binaries.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversial}} area is {{the universal}} default feature of many North American credit card contracts. When a cardholder is late paying a particular credit card issuer, that card's interest rate can be raised, often considerably. With universal default, a customer's other credit cards, for which the customer may be current on payments, may also have their rates and credit limit changed. The universal default feature allows creditors to periodically check cardholders' credit portfolios to view trade, allowing these other institutions to decrease the credit limit or increase rates on cardholders who may be late with another credit card issuer. <b>Being</b> <b>late</b> on one credit card will potentially affect all the cardholder's credit cards. Citibank voluntarily stopped this practice in March 2007 and Chase stopped the practice in November 2007.|$|E
25|$|Muncie {{played in}} the Pro Bowl after the 1979 season with the Saints and was {{selected}} as the Most Valuable Player of the game. He was the first Saints player named to the Pro Bowl and also was the first Saints player ever to reach the 1,000-yard rushing plateau when he ran for a then-team record of 1,198 yards in 1979. Coming from the tolerant environment in Berkeley, it was a culture shock for Muncie in New Orleans, where his house and car were regularly vandalized by racists despite his living in a nice neighborhood. He frequently expressed his unhappiness in New Orleans. Saints coach Dick Nolan grew tired of Muncie <b>being</b> <b>late</b> for meetings and practices. After the Saints began the 1980 season with an 0–4 record, they traded Muncie to the 4–0 San Diego Chargers.|$|E

25|$|Week 11 saw the Minnesota Vikings (5–4) at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6–3). Tampa Bay {{was coming}} off a bye week and was a {{notoriously}} difficult team to run against. Peterson was limited to 85 yards on just 19 carries, as the Vikings struggled to produce offense. In Week 12, Peterson was benched the first two offensive series against the Jacksonville Jaguars for <b>being</b> <b>late</b> to a team meeting, although he did amass 80 rushing yards and a touchdown. At the end of Week 12, Peterson became the NFL league leader for rushing yards again with 1,311 yards. Following Week 16, Peterson had 1,657 yards which led the league, and it was announced on December 18, Peterson would be the starting running back for the NFC Pro Bowl team. In his final regular season game in 2008, Peterson ran for 103 yards 21 carries, including a 67-yard touchdown run.|$|E
25|$|Hastings {{invested}} $2.5 {{million in}} startup cash for Netflix. Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon {{and wanted to}} find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were available in only a few markets in 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry. Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for <b>being</b> <b>late</b> to return a copy of Apollo 13 but this is an apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.|$|E
25|$|Result: Platinum {{got out to}} {{an early}} start, getting some {{relatively}} good discounts on their first few items, but things were marred by infighting among the sub-team of David, Amy and Lucy. The team also struggled to find {{some of the more}} expensive items on the list, and were late back to the Coliseum. None of the Odyssey members started buying anything until three hours in, with the sub-team of Patrick, Maria and Navdeep spending a further three hours doing research. Their research did pay off however, as they got some significant discounts on the items that they did buy. Ultimately the teams both bought only five of the ten items each. However, Platinum were cost dearly by <b>being</b> <b>late</b> and not buying a second-hand car, the most expensive item on the list and correspondingly the one with the biggest fine. Platinum's total spend was £2,204, and Odyssey's total spend was £2,033.|$|E
