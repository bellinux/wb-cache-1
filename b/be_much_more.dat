50|$|Acylation <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{straightforward}} as {{the resulting}} α-cyanocarbonyl compounds <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> acidic (and less nucleophilic) than corresponding starting materials. Monoacylated products {{can be obtained}} easily.|$|R
50|$|Also, Oiwa <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> direct in her vengeance than Okiku, {{another popular}} kabuki ghost, and she <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> brutal. This added level of {{violence}} thrilled audiences, who were seeking more and more violent forms of entertainment.|$|R
5|$|Ecuador {{is still}} at risk from earthquakes: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and {{interplate}} earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, as it can <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> powerful than interplate seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil liquefaction.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal {{machines}} used to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{common than}} vertical machines; however, today they represent just 10% of all broaching machines purchased. Vertical machines are more popular because they take up less space.|$|E

50|$|Since cows {{were the}} {{backbone}} of farming then, used both for their milk and plowing, cows <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> valuable than hogs. Slaughtering hogs for feasts and special occasions <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> common than slaughtering cows, which helps explain the dish's pork origins.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the writing}} {{received}} mixed reviews, {{the reception of}} the artwork was almost entirely positive. Higgins, recalling the heavy blacks and bold outlines of the original strip, found Critchlow's new style to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> open and expressive. Maxwell also praised Critchlow's development as an artist, judging the comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear line style. Carter thought that the art was a little flat in places, but nevertheless praised it for being unique {{with a lot of}} character.|$|E
5|$|Book Three: Change {{aired on}} short notice in June 2014 after Spanish-language {{versions}} of some episodes were leaked on the Internet. The season premiered with 1.5 million viewers. After declining TV ratings in the third season, Nickelodeon stopped airing the series on television and shifted its distribution to online outlets, where the show had proven to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> successful.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, Gavyn Davies for The Financial Times {{emphasized}} that a key {{difference between the}} 1930s and the 21st century outbreaks {{is that in the}} thirties some of the retaliations between countries were carried out not by devaluations, but by increases in import tariffs, which tend to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> disruptive to international trade.|$|E

He said“I think {{there were a few}} things that went wrong; I underestimated the ISL. I {{thought it was going to}} be easier than it was, and then I picked up a hamstring injury in pre-season which set me back.|$|E
5|$|Sif has {{inspired}} {{the name of}} a volcano on the planet Venus (Sif Mons). Sif's characterization in modern media tends to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> martial than in original sources. The Marvel Comics character, Sif, is based on the Sif of Norse myth and is portrayed by Jaimie Alexander in the Marvel Studios film Thor, its , and the Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D television series.|$|E
5|$|With {{the factory}} {{temporarily}} shut down, Sulley is named the new CEO of Monsters, Inc. Under his leadership, {{the energy crisis}} is solved by harvesting children's laughter instead of screams, as laughter {{has been found to}} <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> potent. Mike takes Sulley aside, revealing he has rebuilt Boo's door and only needs one final piece, which Sulley took as a memento. Sulley enters and joyfully reunites with Boo.|$|E

5|$|A. Newton {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published {{a plate of}} the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It {{may have been the}} same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.|$|E
5|$|Assuming a {{composition}} {{similar to that}} of Jupiter and that the planet's atmosphere is close to chemical equilibrium, it is predicted that 55 Cancri d is covered in a layer of water clouds: the planet's internal heat probably keeps it too warm to form the ammonia-based clouds that are typical of Jupiter. Its surface gravity is likely to be about 4 to 5 times stronger than Jupiter, or about 10 to 15 times that of Earth which is because the radius of the planet is unlikely to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than Jupiter's and is probably slightly smaller than Jupiter due to the high metal content in the parent star.|$|E
5|$|Mahatma Gandhi's life {{achievement}} stands {{unique in}} political history. He has invented {{a completely new}} and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only {{be the work of}} such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.|$|E
50|$|It {{demonstrates}} that small-state senators <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to engage}} in pork barrel politics than large-state senators and <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> likely to have leadership positions.

5|$|Northeast Pacific {{resident}} groups tend to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> vocal than transient {{groups in}} the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audio-gram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others {{remain to be}} explored scientifically. There {{is no reason to}} presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E
5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} of the Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is the end result of a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than mere observance of rules, and must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|E
