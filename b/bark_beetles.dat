5|$|The bark beetle, {{elm leaf beetle}} and the Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) {{are among}} the species that attack elm trees. <b>Bark</b> <b>beetles</b> (Scolytidae) carry Dutch elm disease as they move from {{infected}} breeding sites to healthy trees. The disease has devastated elm trees across Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as <b>bark</b> <b>beetles,</b> kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} of the Myxogastria to other creatures {{have not been}} thoroughly researched as of 2012. Their natural predators include many arthropods, including mites and springtails, and especially beetles such as the rove beetles, round fungus beetles, wrinkled <b>bark</b> <b>beetles,</b> Eucinetidae, Clambidae, Eucnemidae (false click beetles), Sphindidae, Cerylonidae, and minute brown scavenger beetles. Various Nematodes have also been observed to be their predators; they attach their posterior portion on the cytosol of the plasmodia or even live within the strands. Certain Diptera species have evolved to specialise in this way: these are mostly representatives of the Mycetophilidae, Sciaridae and Drosophilidae. The species Epicypta testata was especially frequently found, especially on Enteridium lycoperdon, Enteridium splendens, Lycogala epidendrum and Tubifera ferruginosa.|$|E
40|$|European spruce <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus) is {{a natural}} forest pest that feeds on {{coniferous}} trees, mainly on spruce. Previous studies showed that population growth of <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> is supported by warm and dry weather and hindered by cold and humid weather. Temperature affects development rates and influences the number of generations <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> may produce during one season; furthermore, it affects survival rates during the winter. Low precipitation leads to water stress of spruce trees which become more prone to <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> infestation. High precipitation promotes growth of mold and other natural enemies of <b>bark</b> <b>beetle.</b> The aim of the experimental part of this thesis was to analyze the relationship between population dynamics of <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> and weather, {{using data from the}} Å umava national park.

5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{generally}} forages in {{the branches}} and foliage of trees, in small groups of up to seven birds. Occasionally larger flocks of up to 30 individuals have been reported, and the species has been encountered in a mixed-species foraging flock with the little friarbird (Philemon citreogularis). The bulk of their diet consists of insects, including cockroaches, termites, grasshoppers, bugs such as lerps, scale (Coccidae) and shield bugs (Pentatomidae), beetles such as <b>bark</b> <b>beetles,</b> chafers (subfamily Melolonthinae), click beetles (genus Xanthophaea), darkling beetles (genera Chalcopteroides and Homotrysis), leaf beetles (genus Paropsis), ladybirds of the genus Scymnus, weevils such as the pinhole borer (Platypus australis), {{and members of the}} genera Mandalotus, Polyphrades and Prypnus, as well as flies, moths, bees, ants and spiders. Birds have been reported preying on small lizards. Prey are caught mostly by sallying, although birds also probe and glean. In Kakadu National Park, birds prefer to hunt prey between the leaf bases of the screw palm Pandanus spiralis.|$|E

25|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{research}} with some clerid species. Forensic research is limited {{because of their}} late arrival on carrion, but members such as Thanasimus undatulus have been researched as a possible role in integrated pest management or IPM. Thanasimus undatulus is a predator of <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b> Some species of <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> such as the southern pine beetle and the mountain pine beetle can become pests to the lumber industry because in large numbers they can cause damage and kill live trees. Thanasimus undatulus has been researched as a possible biological control agent for these pests. Researchers and forestry officials have used bark beetle aggreagation pheromones to attract the checkered beetle to specific trees. This causes the <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> to be overwhelmed, extensively preyed upon by the clerid beetles, and typically eliminated.|$|E

25|$|Many of phloem-feeding <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> use phloem-infesting fungi as an {{addition}} to their diet.

25|$|After {{landing on}} a {{suitable}} tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel {{in which it}} releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near {{the surface of the}} beetle gallery. The majority of ambrosia beetles colonize xylem (sapwood and/or heartwood) of dying or recently dead trees, but some attack live trees. Species differ in their preference for different parts of trees, different stages of deterioration, and in the shape of their tunnels ("galleries"). However, the majority of ambrosia beetles are not specialized to any taxonomic group of hosts, unlike most phytophagous organisms including the closely related <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Europe, the European White Elm Ulmus laevis has {{received}} much attention. Whilst this elm has little innate resistance to Dutch elm disease, {{it is not}} favoured by the vector <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> and thus only becomes colonized and infected {{when there are no}} other choices, a rare situation in western Europe. Research in Spain has suggested that it may be the presence of a triterpene, alnulin, which makes the tree bark unattractive to the beetle species that spread the disease. However this possibility has not been conclusively proven. More recently, Field Elms Ulmus minor highly resistant to DED have been discovered in Spain, and form the basis of a major breeding programme.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> is one {{of about}} 220 genera with 6,000 species of beetles in the {{subfamily}} Scolytinae.

25|$|The climate {{has become}} warmer in Montana and {{continues}} to do so. The glaciers in Glacier National Park have receded and are predicted to melt away completely in a few decades. Many Montana cities set heat records during July 2007, the hottest month ever recorded in Montana. Winters are warmer, too, and have fewer cold spells. Previously these cold spells had killed off <b>bark</b> <b>beetles,</b> but these are now attacking the forests of western Montana. The warmer winters {{in the region have}} allowed various species to expand their ranges and proliferate. The combination of warmer weather, attack by beetles, and mismanagement during past years has led to a substantial increase in the severity of forest fires in Montana. According to a study done for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science, portions of Montana will experience a 200-percent increase in area burned by wildfires, and an 80-percent increase in related air pollution.|$|E
25|$|The general {{life cycle}} of clerids {{has been known to}} last {{anywhere}} from 35 days to more than 3 years, and is strongly dependent on the {{life cycle of}} their prey. While the life cycle can vary in length between genus and species, temperature is also a major determinant in the length of time spent in each stage of development. The warmer the temperature is, the quicker the lifecycle, and the cooler the temperature is the slower the lifecycle. If temperatures dip below a threshold temperature {{for an extended period of}} time clerids and most other insects will have growth and developmental progress arrested. Like all beetles, Cleridae follow a holometabolous life cycle: the egg hatches into a larva, which grows and feeds, changing its skin to form a pupa, and the pupa shedding its skin to emerge as an adult. The larvae of the majority of the known species of Cleridae feed upon the eggs and young of wood-boring beetles, while the adults feed on the adult <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b>|$|E
