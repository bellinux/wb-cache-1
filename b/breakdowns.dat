40|$|Urbanization alters water {{physical}} and chemical variables and may affect leaf-litter <b>breakdown</b> in streams. Higher temperature and nutrient inputs in urban streams can stimulate microbial biomass, which can increase leaf-litter <b>breakdown</b> rates over rates in nonurban streams.

We evaluated physical, chemical, and biological factors that may directly and indirectly affect leaf-litter <b>breakdown</b> of Coussapoa trinervia and Mabea speciosa in 42 urban streams in Central Amazonia. We used structural equation modeling to assess whether: 1) shredder activity {{is more important than}} microbes for leaf-litter <b>breakdown</b> of plant species with softer tissues, 2) microbes (as adenosine triphosphate [ATP] concentration) and fungi (as ergosterol concentration) positively influence leaf-litter <b>breakdown</b> rate, 3) water velocity positively affects leaf-litter <b>breakdown</b> rate, and 4) effects of shredders and microbes, including fungi, on leaf-litter <b>breakdown</b> are mediated by the effects of urbanization. Leaf-litter <b>breakdown</b> of M. speciosa and C. trinervia was fastest in the least urbanized streams.

Despite some differences, voltage <b>breakdown</b> in microwave resonators shares some features with <b>breakdown</b> in DC vacuum gaps (diodes). In both cases, the localized desorption of gas around an electron emission-source (e. g., field emission) could lead to <b>breakdown.</b> Analytical calculation shows that <b>breakdown</b> occurs when the product of the gas density and emission current exceed a critical value. 	Voltage <b>breakdown</b> in vacuum results from the interaction of the electric field and the electrodes.
