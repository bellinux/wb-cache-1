He gave a fresh treatment {{to the effects of}} the Australian sunlight on the native bushland by depicting it <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear,</b> a definite departure from the darker [...] "English country garden" [...] paradigm. Note this example Patterdale Farm (circa 1840).|$|E

The next day, the ship was ordered to terminate her patrol, and she returned to Guam on 3 February.|$|E
2500|$|The weather on {{the morning}} of 29 June was <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear</b> and Allied {{aircraft}} conducted many ground attack sorties and reconnaissance flights, which found that many German reinforcements were heading for the Odon area. The German counter-offensive by the , took place south of the 49th Division, either side of the Odon river between Queudeville and Évrecy, against the VIII Corps salient. XXX Corps provided artillery support to VIII Corps and prepared to defend the ground around Rauray. The 1st Tyneside Scottish found that any movement attracted massed mortar fire from [...] and a tank periodically harassed the company dug in north of the village. The company was withdrawn to avoid an artillery barrage, preparatory to an attack on the village by the 11th DLI {{but as soon as the}} move was spotted, a [...] bombardment began and caused many casualties. The battalion was relieved at [...] on 30 June, by the 4th Battalion The Lincolnshire Regiment (4th Lincolns). [...] and artillery fire fell on the 10th DLI and 4/7th Dragoon Guards south of Rauray during the day, where several tanks were lost while reconnoitring the forward slope. On 30 June, the two Durham battalions were relieved at Rauray by the Tyneside Scottish, which sent patrols forward in the evening.|$|E

2500|$|Germans eat a Three Kings cake {{which may}} be a golden pastry ring filled with orange and spice {{representing}} gold, frankincense and myrrh. Most often found in Switzerland, these cakes {{take the form of}} Buchteln but for Epiphany, studded with citron, and baked as seven large buns in a round rather than square pan, forming a crown. Or they may be made of typical rich Christmas bread dough with cardamom and pearl sugar in the same seven bun crown shape. These varieties are most typically purchased in supermarkets with the trinket, and gold paper crown included. As in other countries, the person who receives the piece or bun containing the trinket or whole almond becomes the king or queen for a day. Epiphany is also an especially joyful occasion for the young and young at heart as this is the day dedicated to plündern – that is, when Christmas trees are [...] "plundered" [...] of their cookies and sweets by eager children (and adults) and when gingerbread houses, and any other good things left in the house from Christmas are devoured. Lastly, there is a German rhyme saying, or Bauernregel, that goes Ist's bis Dreikönigs kein Winter, kommt keiner dahinter meaning [...] "If there hasn't been any Winter (weather) until Epiphany, none is coming afterward." [...] Another of these Bauernregel, (German farmer's rules) for Epiphany states: Dreikönigsabend hell und klar, verspricht ein gutes Weinjahr or [...] "If the eve of Epiphany is <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear,</b> it foretells a good wine year." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was only}} time for two overs before stumps and Brian Statham made the ball lift outside the off-stump, {{which might have}} {{produced}} a wicket given another quarter of an hour, but Colin McDonald and Jim Burke survived the day on 8/0. The first day had produced only 142 runs and although the Saturday was <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear</b> and good for batting, only 148 runs were made as an excellent England bowling attack regained the initiative and the Australian batsmen eked out the runs. Burke edged a catch to gully, but Trevor Bailey was too deep to catch it and after a slow start—and much to everybody's surprise—he peeled off a couple of cover-drives off Peter Loader. Loader was repeatedly no-balled {{and was replaced by}} Bailey and the openers took their partnership past fifty when the sightsreen was laboriously moved and Loader returned round the wicket to have Burke caught behind for 20. The teams went off for lunch at the fall of the wicket and returned on 55/1 with Neil Harvey coming in instead of Ken Mackay as announced by the scoreboard, indicating that Benaud wanted the runs to flow. Bailey had McDonald caught in slip for 42 in two hours and Norm O'Neill (who had not broken his finger as first thought) came in with the hopes of Australia hanging on his shoulders. May set a defensive field to limit his runmaking, but he hit his first ball for four before the runs dried up and he was outpaced by [...] "Slasher" [...] Mackay. Loader (4/56 with 19 no balls) caught Harvey l.b.w. after he had spent an hour making 14. Bailey (3/35) accounted for the out of form Peter Burge and had O'Neill was caught by a spectacular diving catch by Tom Graveney for 34 in 151 minutes, Jim Laker (2/15) had Mackay (16) caught behind, much to his displeasure and Australia ended the day on 156/6, 22 runs ahead. After the rest day Australia did not long survive the fall of Benaud (16) on the Monday morning, l.b.w. to Loader and the tail collapsed to 186 all out despite the best efforts of Alan Davidson (25), last man out to Laker.|$|E

50|$|In 1877 Reynaud {{had created}} the praxinoscope, an {{improvement}} of the zoetrope. The praxinoscope replaced the narrow viewing slits of the zoetrope with an inner circle of 12 mirrors (equal {{to the number of}} images), allowing a <b>brighter</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer</b> view of the moving image. After Reynaud licensed his invention in 1877, it sold well in a number of the large Paris department stores.|$|R

They were wound with approximately 6,800 turns of copper wire, yielding a DC resistance of approximately 10.6 kΩ (compared to a standard Gibson P.A.F. humbucker typical DC resistance of 9 kΩ).|$|R

5000|$|The {{main purpose}} of Hexachrome {{was to create a}} {{printing}} ink system that could depict <b>brighter</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer</b> pictures by being able to produce more accurate colors. [...] Using this system instead of the CMYK ink system prints also allowed for more accurate skin tones and pastels. The Hexachrome system let users print images from computer screens that were not able to be accurately duplicated before. As well as producing overall better quality than previous systems, Hexachrome also increased efficiency as it produced many more spot colors. Having more spot colors increased efficiency by allowing the press to use one ink set for all jobs, rather than one specified ink set for each job. Keeping a printer configured for Hexachrome also eliminated the number of washes required on the printer; therefore saving times and simplifying printing production.|$|R

30|$|When {{examining}} {{the independent variable}} Exposure, laundering had a different influence than light exposure on color compositions of mordanted and nonmordanted dyed specimens. For black walnut, mordanted and nonmordanted specimens were greener (a*) and bluer (b*) when subjected to laundering (Table  3). Mordanted specimens were yellower (b*) than nonmordanted specimens but only before laundering. After laundering, b* value became similar for both mordanted and nonmordanted. For Osage orange, mordanted specimens were redder (a*) than nonmordanted before laundering, but a* of both became similar after laundering. Mordanted Osage orange was also yellower (b*) and nonmordanted Osage orange was bluer (b*) after laundering. For eastern redcedar, specimens turned lighter, redder, and bluer after laundering both for mordanted and nonmordanted. When visually inspecting the specimens, mordanted and laundered Osage orange was a <b>brighter</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer</b> yellow when compared to nonmordanted. It is recommended for natural dyers wanting to maintain a bright yellow to use a PAS mordant on wool yarns dyed with Osage orange.|$|R
