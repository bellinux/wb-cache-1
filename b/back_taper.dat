40|$|Abstract. At present, in the cycloid {{rotational}} indexing processing <b>back</b> <b>taper</b> technique, machining requirements {{were achieved}} mainly through {{the method of}} using cycloid cluster to approach the involute, so that the processing efficiency was hindered. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved method that reduces the number of cycloids to enhance the processing efficiency. Firstly, the best approximating cycloid of the involute tooth profile is figured out. Then, the involute is segmented into sections, and the best approximating cycloid on each section is calculated. Each cycloid approaches the involute section to a maximum extent until completing the entire involute approximation. Finally, the simulative processing is carried out. The result demonstrates {{that the number of}} cycloids is one third of the previous and the machining time saves about 64 %. This indicates that the improved method is feasible to machine <b>back</b> <b>taper...</b>|$|E

40|$|Rugby {{league is}} a high intensity, {{collision}} sport where understanding strength, speed and power characteristics are imperative for strength and conditioning coaches to recognise {{the demands of the}} sport. Due to the high demands of elite rugby league, fatigue can impair on field performance. Implementing a taper can aid in reducing the effect of fatigue on performance. This thesis sought to gain insight into strength, speed and power differences between forwards and <b>backs,</b> <b>tapering</b> and physiological and performance changes and the effects of tapering on power-force-velocity profiling and jump performance in professional rugby league players. Our findings showed that backs are faster over 10 m (Effect Size= 1. 26) and 40 m (ES= 1. 61) than forwards. Furthermore, backs produce greater relative horizontal force (ES= 0. 87) and power (ES= 1. 04) compared to forwards. Our findings suggest that developing horizontal force and power may potentially improve short sprint performance in rugby league players. On the basis of the literature review, significant improvements in physiological and performance measures occurred after a short tapering period. In the fourth chapter, a 21 day step taper was implemented leading into the in-season with 7 professional rugby league players. Measurements included vertical jump, performance and force-velocity-power variables. Our findings show positive changes in the power-force-velocity profile when implementing a step taper. A likely increase in F 0 and a very likely increase in Pmax was found after a 21 day tapering period. Furthermore, jumping performance saw likely to most likely increases post taper. We suggest implementing a short step taper leading into the season where resistance training volume decreases to improve Pmax and jump performance...|$|R

The spirally arranged leaves have generally lance-shaped, toothed blades up to 16 centimeters long. They are dark green and waxy {{on the upper}} surfaces and silvery green on the undersides. They are sometimes hairy. Light purple flowers grow in the leaf axils. They have hairy bracts and sepals. The <b>back</b> sepal <b>tapers</b> into a long spur.

40|$|Back contact cells {{not only}} require adapted {{technologies}} for module assembly, but they offer cost saving potentials on module level. Cell interconnection and layup are mostly affected.

Finite Element Analysis {{has been used to}} assess mechanical stress. For distributed <b>back</b> contacts, <b>tapered</b> interconnector designs with constant current density can make more efficient use of copper material compared to standard ribbons. With stress relief junctions, the thermo-mechanical stress between adjacent joints can be controlled and bi-metallic deformation effects after soldering are avoided. In terms of cell layup, we developed a technology that requires only one cell handling step. After the cell is placed on the encapsulant/glass stack, it is fixed by vacuum and can be further processed and laminated.

The aircraft {{featured a}} tall tricycle landing gear with a small tailwheel in case of over-rotation on takeoff. The fabric covered fuselage was made of welded steel tube with wooden wing ribs. The S-3 differed from the S-2 in that it included a small rudder and elevator at the rear of the fuselage, rather than placing all of the controls on the low aspect ratio wing. The fuselage was sharp-edged with a less streamlined windshield. The dihedral was inadvertently increased compared to the S-2 due to errors in the wing jigs.|$|R
